B007TNQ7EY|5.0|I think its an awesome game the graphics nd sound are incredible but i think this game shoulda being longer more missions
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|It is a great book.  Truly an amazing and inspiring novel to all those who read it.  It commands all of your attention as you are taken to Meg, Joe, Beth, and Amy's world.  There are many happy, sad, surprising, and inspiring moments throughout this book as the four young girls try to find their place in this harsh new world.  They do not start out with much coming from a poor family, but New friendships and romances help them find their way to become the woman that they always hoped to be.
B0091REZMW|3.0|When I play these mystery games, I like to continue I don't want  to pay anything, but some time things are not free.
B00CDT41RY|2.0|The film is all weak caricatures, sight gags and pseudo-spaghetti. Kristoph Waltz is a cold-blooded bounty hunter in some scenes but patiently recounts childhood fairy tales and offers remedial reading lessons in others. The costumery rivals a bad drag show and the \\"homage\\" to Italian \\"spaghetti westerns\\" is pretentious. And of course there is the violence but in this film it's all spaghettied-up in massive explosions of candy apple red and \\"thick as paint\\" blood. The real surprise is DiCaprio. He did a nice job. So did Waltz (bad script and all) but of course that's no surprise. It's not a bad film but its utterly undistinguished.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|my fiancee' & I love this film and have for a while. as my fiancee' IS the dude, except for the laziest man in l.a.. my Dude works his butt off so we can have a nice wedding in October!
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|play it for hours on end.  takes the mind away from stress and anxiety.  would recommend  it to all ages
B00CL68BK2|4.0|I didn't know anything about it before watching so it was a bit surprising. It was a different kind of story and kept my attention to the very end. I thought it was well acted and well cast.
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|The show really does get better and better every week. Each episode is the best yet. Yes, there's gore, but I wouldn't call it unnecessary or over the line. The writing is great, and the acting is just phenomenal. Mikkelsen is an excellent Hannibal, Dancy plays a great (though more emotionally vulnerable than expected) Graham, Fishburne gives a new look at Jack, and the supporting cast is fantastic. Must watch.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|The author is clever.  Period.  I couldn't put the book down and I was not disappointed with the ending at all.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This game surprised me,in a good way. It is more than I first thought I am addicted to the preservation of my coral reef, the happiness of the variety of its inhabitants and to bringing new exotic life into the area. I AM HOOKED!!
B00BB8SKPW|1.0|Denzel Washington is a gifted and wonderful actor.  Why he puts himself is such terrible movies like this one, I don't understand.  The plot was sick as was the language.  Honestly, whomever wrote the script needs to broaden their knowledge of the English language.  Terrible movie.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|oh its just so cute when I'm like a hundred years I gees that maby I would still be playing with this app and I just love it
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Not the most intellectually compelling movie I've ever seen but it was fun and entertaining. I rented it for download to my Kindle Fire HD for a plane trip and was not disappointed. It is one of those movies like Space Cowboys where aging well known actors play age-appropriate characters who still have something to do and who can surprise the youngsters. The movie has some romance, some humor, plenty of action, and some feel good moments. Whether you have officially entered geezerhood or can see it looming on the horizon you will enjoy this movie.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Nothing you mights saybut some people spend all their time on it. Why i dont kno but if you think about it is a bad thing to do foryour brain. Soi wouldent realy recomend thisgame but it isa littlehard  for me. But some sayits easy i don't so thanks for listening.
B004R36QUE|5.0|We saw this movie twice in theaters, bought it on DVD, and I recently decided to purchase it for download to my Kindle Fire where I am considering not only the extra cost of the additional format but storage space on the device. I choose movies to purchase for my Kindle Fire HD based on something I can open up, start anywhere, and watch either for a plane trip or for 15 minutes of time to kill. This counts.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|I became absolutely engulfed with Phantom music after watching this. It's brilliant, and so, so well done-- I absolutely recommend it.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Well put together. Jack reacher has less \\"coincidental\\" happenings here which makes the book more believable. Good pace. His \\" brothers and sisters \\" in arms get good attention in this book.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|It was wonderful on TV but even better on a disk. I can pick and choose what songs I want to hear.
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|I downloaded and bought several other suspense/thriller books and was suggested this book based on my reading preference. For a nominal cost, I thought, \\"Why not?\\"<br /><br />Are you looking for a thriller that rivals other thriller books? This book's plot, storyline and characters construct a thoughtful story. If you've read other suspense books than you understand I  can't tell you the story because it'll ruin it for you. I'll say this much,the build up may take some time but the author makes a concerted effort to engage readers with two detectives that have a past that must mesh with one another.<br /><br />If you're a thrill seeking, murder-suspense book conniseur than the value of this book is a drop in the bucket.
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|The movie on my TV is not as spectacular as in the theater, but it's great to be able to fast forward to the key parts.
B009MF5BXK|4.0|My son liked this DVD and has added it to his collection of favorites. We may be on the lookout for more..
B000JMKQX0|2.0|My problem is the writing style. All over the place. Written in reporter, first person,  just have never liked that style of writing.  Never finished as I got bored. Movie looks better than the book
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun variety of games. Some are challenging, while some are an easy way to accumulate more points. Recommend this app.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I have played this on the phone and been waiting for it to come out on the kindle and now its out.  You should try it.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|When I first opened the book, I couldnt put it down. For two days straight I could not put this book down. It is all I could expect from this exciting series.
B00009Y3L4|5.0|This musical gem set in the Wiemar Republic of Germany, or<br />Berlin between the wars, is filmed in the manner of the art form<br />of the day: Dada. It's a cynical attitude that mocks you if you<br />are aesthetically involved: Whenever you feel empathy or<br />suspense, the action cuts to the cabaret stage to mock you<br />with a snide commentary on what you've been watching.<br />The first shot is a dull mirroring copper panel to the left of the<br />stage that shows you, the watchers. The last shot shows the<br />copper panel to the right of the stage that shows you sitting<br />and watching among many Nazi-uniformed soldiers.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|This is a great story! I do not have HBO, but I kept hearing about this series. I thought I would buy the first season and see what all the hoopla was about. Now I understand! At first it can be a bit overwhelming trying to remember who all the characters are, but read the guide that comes with the DVD's of who's who it does help. I ended up watching this first season in just a couple of days because I just kept wanting to see what was going to happen next. This series has all the components that make a great story line work, sex, violence, love, hate, greed, betrayal, and more sex (not necessary in that order). If you were a fan of the Tudors, you will love this series just as much or more.
B003Y5H5BA|4.0|I heard this movie was pretty funny.  I didn't want to believe it, and i'm not a Tatum Channing fan (whatever his name is)  But, i gave this a shot after some very close friends told me it was great.<br /><br />I have to say, i found this movie hysterical!!! It did have  a few dry boring parts throughout, but i had a good smile on my face for at least 75% of this movie.<br /><br />I recommend this to fans of Jonah Hill
B0060MYM3S|5.0|The second season picks up right where the first one leaves off. By time you are watching season 2 you now know who everyone is and you cant wait to see what is going to happen to them next. Oh and you will have the characters that you love to hate (Joffery to name one). You hope to see them get their just desserts. The great thing about having the DVD's is you can re watch an episode as needed. Once again I watched this season within a day or two because I did not want to wait to see what was going to happen. Cant wait for the next season to be ready on DVD's.
B009AMANH4|3.0|I was so disappointed.  I looked forward to it and phtt,.It was dark and gritty and BORING.  He (Steven Speilberg) did not humanize Lincoln; but gave us a 2 hour history lesson.
B00A757EFW|4.0|This bring back old memories of when I played in my younger days. It is relaxing. I would recommend it to a friend.
B00AHTYGRW|2.0|Like AMISTAD, Steven Speilberg made Argo dark and gritty.  You knew the outcome from the very beginning,  Ben Affleck did his best; which is mediocre at best.  I don't know what all the hoopla was about
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|This movie had so much potential. I expected it to show situations that are common to those in the ~40 yr-old demographic, married, with children - of which, I am one. What I saw was a series of events that did mirror everyday life in many cases and - like everyday life - it wasn't funny. It is stressful. The movie could have taken the same situations and presented them in a humorous way that would take the edge of (kind of like the way the movie Parenthood did). It never delivered.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Absolutly love this game. Super fun and really addictive. Tried it bc it looked fun and was free. &amp; fell in love.
B003TNM2K6|1.0|movie was good but the movie stop every 5 min to redownload.downloading this movie was worst than downloading a free movie.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love the fact that it is so large & easy to see, I have no problem with hitting the correct buttons.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I couldn't put down the first two books in the series, but when it came to the last one, it was<br />a bit confusing, and disappointing.  It was sad what had happened to Peeta, and then her<br />little sister.<br /><br />The ending wasn't exactly how I had imagined it would be, but as far as writing style, and<br />capturing the imagination, she is a gifted author.  I would recommend reading the final book<br />just so you have a closure to Katniss's life.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is awesome, I think that everyone should give it a try. The only downside is I wish it had a infinity limit world but besides that it is epic!
B000009HF2|5.0|Contains all hits from his San Francisco Concert. Sound quality is really good. Package is normal. You won't be disappointed.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book was amazing! I read it in one night. Constant twists and turns....unbelievable ending. Reading the book from Andy's perspective has you questioning his every move, every thought. Must read for any age!
B0091REZMW|1.0|ended up removing from my Kindle ... was locking up when I attempted to start the program receiving an error message
B002BU0DPE|5.0|Fir a nice headset not too expensive this one is perfect, sound is great and when your chathing w a friend its clear and nice. Hightly recommended.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|great flick - started it on one airline flight and finished on another flight - really enjoyed the movie on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9
B00CM6ZLG8|5.0|Demi has been an artist all along, but with this album, she truly stakes her claim without ever letting up. Each track has the potential for single release, yet Demi never strays too far mainstream. (This will surely please new and old fans alike.) If you're looking for a great pop album with enough ballads to move your spirit and enough dance beats to move your feet, then &#34;Demi&#34; is the album you've been waiting for. Give it one listen, and you'll be hooked.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|I really wanted to like this movie as I have watched all of Tom Hanks movies.  Sorry, but this movie is HORRIBLE!  There is no rhyme or reason to the plot, you never know when you are in time.  It's very hard to follow and I hate to say it but this is the worst movie I have ever watched.  There is an extremely graphic full nudity very \\"pornlike\\" sex scene in it I thought was tasteless and unnecessary to the plot.  It's not that I didn't appreciate the concept of the movie of love lasting through the centuries and never dying, it was just poorly executed and as much fun to watch as it is going to get a tooth pulled at the dentist.  Sorry but save your money and rent something else.
B00CAJDUX8|3.0|I was expecting an album weighted more heavily with party anthems. I understand the artistry behind certain songs, but personally, I would've loved an album loaded with dance tracks. Standout tracks include &#34;Fall Down,&#34; &#34;Far Away From Home,&#34; and &#34;Hello.&#34; It's not what I was anticipating but still worth adding to your collection if you're looking for a fun listen.
B00AOEA22I|4.0|This CD has much going for it, impeccable production, great musicianship, and stellar vocals by Jeff Scott Soto. That being said, it is a few notches below the bands debut cd. The biggest problems, in my opinion, are a greater tendency to sound generic at times and frequency of choruses that are too long winded (6 or 8 lines)and drag on rather than get to the point. Overall, the sound is polished to a fine shine, but the songs tend to sound more forced instead of inspired. Despite Soto singing his behind off to try and add a sense of conviction to this, it often sounds like assembly-line late 80's hard rock. For perspective, I personally own over 3,000 cd's and cherry-pick the best tracks off each for my master music hard drive (10,000+ and counting wav files), I picked 6 tracks off this cd after listening through it twice. I kept 11 tracks off their superior debut. This cd is quite good and worth buying if you liked the first one, at it's best, it's a continuation of the debut, at it's worst, it sounds like leftovers from the first cd sessions. Maybe they followed up too quickly and should have taken more time to let the inspiration come to them...
B00CTT9646|5.0|This movie is lots of fun. Cumberbatch is great in his part and Quinto nails his rose also, and the rest of the cast is very good. There is a lot of noise about the plot twist, but I have not heard anyone remember a similar, not exact, plot twist used in ST:The Next Generation. The complainers should remember the ST:The Next Generation employed a similar twist with the character of Lt. Yar in the awesome Ep: Yesterday's Enterprise and in few subsequent episodes brought her back, sort of. Anyway this movie is great, see it.
1416909532|1.0|My issue with this book, and the phenomenon it has created, is---the authors are not psychologists, researchers, or doctors. They are not family therapists, or relationship experts.

B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Yeah...that's what I thought going into this, but I decided to give it a shot because Ang Lee has done some awesome stuff in the past and because several people I know saw it and said it was amazing.<br /><br />THEY WERE RIGHT!<br /><br />This is an incredible film that I would recommend to anyone of any age.  There is a lot to love.  The special effects are so lifelike that you forget that there is NO WAY they could have had the tiger and the boy on the same set.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed with this film if you are a fan of a great story and great movies.

0440237688|5.0|Lois Lowry slowly and steadily builds up to the startling revelations in The Giver that adult readers know are there, but will take younger readers by surprise. One can't help but feel a sense of unease when reading about a utopian society: what they offer comes at a great cost to the individual. While the individuals in The Giver live a life free from bad things such as physical and emotional pain, it comes at a cost of their freedom to choose, their freedom to feel. Of course, the citizens have no idea what they are missing; they have been trained to have such a precise vocabulary that extremes don't exist. When the main character, Jonas, says he is starving, his elders correct him. He can never starve, because food is always provided for him, but he can be hungry. On the surface this sounds like a wonderful place to live, however Lowry demonstrates that in order to live in a world with the greatest amount of good, there must also be evil.<br /><br />The Giver, like 1984 before it, focuses on the importance of language to control a community. Words can only take on meaning if we have learned or experienced that meaning. When the Giver first tells Jonas about snow, Jonas is confused because he has never heard of nor experienced snow. Jonas, after experiencing the memory of snow, cannot then tell of his experience to the community because the word, and the thing, does not exist in their memories. Similarly, color does not exist, and so there is no concept of red or green or yellow or white and so on. Even in their feelings, the people of the community are trained to know only the less severe of feelings. When Jonas feels that he is frightened, it sounds wrong to him until he realizes it isn't fear he feels, but anxiety. Fear, like starvation, can't exist in a world where terrible things can't happen.<br /><br />Also similar to Orwell's concerns of totalitarian communism, Lowry has concerns about societal \\"sameness.\\" This sameness is what creates the most secure world, as it's only in differences that danger lies. Citizens aren't allowed much in the way of personalities. Of course, the system does account for those inevitable differences that people have. People are tracked into certain jobs based on their unique traits. But to call these differences personalities might be a stretch. It's difficult to have a personality when you're not allowed to lie, for example, or when you must robotically accept every apology thrown at you (and those are quite frequent). The ideal society that Lowry sees is colorless and consists of a nuclear family of a mother, a father, and two children. Think of the scenes from Edward Scissorhands where all houses look the same and everyone leaves for work at the same time. The sameness Lowry fears is not something in a communist nightmare, but a modern, capitalist society. She asks, how far is a society that's not allowed to think for itself willing to go to protect its perceived sense of security?d, as it's only in differences that danger lies.

0767827902|5.0|I remember seeing this in 1971 when it was released.  I was browsing through Amazon, looking for movies in the late 60s and early 70s and selected an entire slew of movies that were inventive and \\"groundbreaking\\" in its day.  This one is truly perhaps the best of all. My take is because it is not a period piece of the late 60s, but a period piece reflected back in time to the early 50s...thus not making it \\"dated\\" in the truest sense of the word. I will spare all the details of the film as others have outlined its values and production so well.  I would have stated the same reason, but that would just be redundant. A must have classic to any collection.  To all those who gave this a one star and stated the characters were \\"morons\\", of course they were morons. This is set in Texas...that is what makes the film so engrossing. However, as moronic as they may be, one can not help but love the Hank Williams soundtrack.

034580404X|5.0|a most read for our couple lives... trust me, your wife will thank you endlessly for giving it to her knowing you have read it before handdeling... jejeje
B00CDT41RY|5.0|This movie is classic Tarantino!  Campy music, quirky characters and action done in his unique style.  I've seen so many bad movies lately that this was a breath of fresh air watch.  HIghly recommend it!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Great game! I got this for my 5 year old son. he loves it! I keep playing too, can't. get enough!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Good story line and very interesting and unique  I wouldn't recommend for kids younger than 11 or 12.  A little scary.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I like seeing the weather for the day as a quick reference.  I wish it gave more of what to expect for the week in your local.
B004QXJZXA|5.0|Steve McQueen's Le Mans is an entertaining look at France's annual classic 24-Hour endurance race as it was in 1970.  Although the film is a work of fiction, Le Mans is almost a documentary.  It was filmed entirely on location during and after the 1970 race.  It is about the people involved and, along the way, reveals what it takes to campaign a 200+ mph GT prototype.  It has a great cast that features Elga Andersen and Siegfried Rausch, excellent cinematography, music by Michel Legrand and those remarkable Porsches and Ferraris.  Besides acting, McQueen was a serious motorsport driver, participating in many professional races.  That background is displayed in his film, which is why Le Mans is considered the best by professional racers.  The Blu-ray edition of this film is a joy to watch.  Greatly improved HD surround audio and superb video provides the sensation of being there.  Recommended.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is so handy to use where ever you catch yourself needing to calculate quick, especially when grocery shopping.  I like the largeness of the features that are just like any other calculator.  Very easy to use.
1610390938|5.0|The result of a very careful job carried out on the field and transcripted onto a carefully written, excellent text!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm always picking up some new idea every time I look on it.  It's fun to see what other people enjoy.
B0017TFLBQ|5.0|My Brothers and I would play this all the time. It was fun to find it again and play plus I got the added bonus of Heroes 4.
0767827902|5.0|Great movie. One of the essential movies of the first half of the '70s when the '60s and the sensibility of the Beatles, Stones, and Bob Dylan finally reached Hollywood and the movies were really good (I never thought I would say that, it sounds like my Dad talking about the films of 1939). (Other examples from the first half of the '70s: anything by Altman, anything by Coppola, \\"Mean Streets,\\" \\"The Last Detail,\\" \\"Taking Off,\\" \\"Patton,\\" \\"Sugarland Express,\\" \\"Serpico,\\" \\"Five Easy Pieces,\\" \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\\" \\"The French Connection\\" and, of course, \\"Chinatown.\\"). Anyway, the main reason I'm writing is, several people here note that \\"Texasville\\" is a sequel to \\"The Last Picture Show.\\" I want to also note that \\"Hud\\" (1963) is a sort of prequel and is excellent. Also based on a McMurtry novel. Paul Newman at his peak, Melvyn Douglas very fine, and Patricia Neal knocking the ball out of the park in the role of her lifetime.
B00005NGAK|5.0|I love this show! It has great music and great dancing and is all around an excellent show to watch over and over.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This app has helped me with my homework when my calculator is not in reach.  It is very useful in homework but that is it
B009NY43NY|2.0|I'm not sure what the point of this book was...it felt mainly like pointless rambling to me! I loved much of the rest of the series, but this just didn't do it for me.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|My little cousin told me to get this for him and I did.  the sad part is I can't even open the app when I try and play it.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Since I am from Boston,  I loved the setting and description of the community that is not quite genuine.  It's a great example of nature vs nurture argument.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|this helps me wake up in the morning.  it really does, it really does. If I have no other device to wake me, I use this
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|loved the movie.  could totally relate.  wonderful acting.  great writing.  a twisted love story for sure.  recommend you see it
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|My mom loves this game so I rated it a 5.  She loves these type of games especially bejeweled but this game isn't as great as bejeweled
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|Very entertaining story.  The character s are believable with well written dialogues. Only a few minor logic/situation  story line flaws.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|This app isn't as great as everyone said It was.  I was expecting the graphics to be intricate but they were just bad
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|The eighth season is fresh and exciting.  The characters act with emotion and feeling. The series is still going strong.
B003V1WTMM|5.0|Not only is this a tale of suspense set in a semi-gothic atmosphere, but the story balances well between two time periods.  The writing and descriptions are exquisite.  Kate Morton is one of the finest contemporary writers of fiction I have enjoyed in several years of voracious reading.
B001C4CI8U|2.0|The Fringe Series just ended last fall. And there were never any repeats or chances to watch it again. So i decided to order it and when i got it it was in very good shape and it arrived with in a week. I was very impressed with the speed in which my order was handled.
B006PFC2S2|4.0|I actually heard about this movie from book I was reading. It reminded me of the movie 'somewhere in time' -- another classic!!! I watched it and was pleasantly surprised. How I have lived my life and have never heard of it is beyond me but I'm glad that I have now seen it :)
B0076794IO|4.0|Really liked this book, did get a little confusing near the end but on the whole very entertaining.<br />Highly recommend this book
B005GIS23I|5.0|We found Paul to be a very entertaining movie. it was funny, irrelevant and kept us laughing through out the film.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|A great app! Couldn't put it down even though I found it a bit too easy. Would rate it five stars but it seems to have an issue sometimes when loading between stages. Also thought it was a bit short but the quality makes up for that. The odd atmosphere greatly enhanced the game for me. Felt a certain amount of nostalgia like I was playing another chapter of the Myst game series. Patiently will be awaiting a sequel.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|This is an intense story of life with graphic scenes of life and death.  As an adult it will move you, make you think and it made me cry.  My teen kids hated it-  Too heavy! There are more than a few scenes that are upsetting so don't think it will get more lighthearted as the movie goes on, this movie is not for kids.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|I played this game for maybe 2 hours.I closed it and now it will not let me back in without unlocking it or purchasing it. Liked the game when I got to play it... and apparently it's not free like it says!
1577314808|5.0|Humans are often so caught up in their little problems/pain that they have no time to contemplate what they are missing. Reading &#34;The Power NOW&#34; gives an insight how to live our life in the present.<br />Simon Peter Bargetzi,<br />Author of:  &#34;In Search of Truth, Beauty and Goodness&#34;
0307352153|5.0|I absolutely love this book. And yes, before we continue, I am an introvert. Quiet is a lengthy discussion about introverts vs. extroverts. In case someone does not know, introverts are people who tend to be quiet and withdrawn. They tend to be less social than extroverts, who are very social, talkative and energetic. Or at least that is the stereotype. There is no such thing as a pure introvert or pure extroverts. There are only different degrees.<br /><br />The modern North American society is dominated by the extrovert ideal. We are all expected to be men/women of action who are super friendly to each other (at least on the surface) and who talk a lot. In movies and books, characters who are loners and withdrawn are encouraged by other characters to open up, loosen up and talk more. It even came to this that loners are perceived as mentally ill and dangerous.<br /><br />As for myself, I've been many times teased and ridiculed for being an introvert and pressured by people around me to talk and smile more. I can't say that I was traumatized by all this pressure around me, but many times I got the impression that others, even my own family, think that on some level there is something wrong with me.<br /><br />Quiet tackles many things, such as how the extrovert ideal came to be (it is a rather recent development), the biology and psychology behind different personality types and how introverts and extroverts can get along. Thorough the book the theme that keeps coming back again and again is that there is absolutely nothing wrong with being an introvert. Introverts are not mentally ill or socially maladapted--they are simply different. Being an introvert is a biological thing, so, in any case, they can't really change their nature. At most, they can fake being extroverted, but is pretending to be someone who you are not a good thing?<br /><br />Introverts have a lot to offer. Introverts like to think things through and to plan. Extroverts are more energetic, but they also have a tendency to rush headlong into things without thinking and quite often they get themselves, and others, into trouble. Introverts think a lot, and therefore they come up with new things. They are quite creative and sensitive. Many of the world's greatest scientists, leaders, thinkers and artists were introverts. And although introverts are less social than extroverts (less social is not the same thing as antisocial), they do form relationships that tend to be deeper and more meaningful. Extroverts might be very friendly and talkative, but quite often their friendliness is shallow. It is easy for them to gain new friends, and therefore it is also easy to lose them. And because they have such a wide circle of friends, they cannot commit that much affection and energy to a single relationship. When you have a friend who is an introvert, you have a friend for life.<br /><br />Introverts also tend to be less interested in acquiring money and power, nor do they chase after fame and prestige. This had lead some people to accuse introverts of being lazy and lacking ambition. They aren't. Introverts simply desire different things, such as knowledge, for example,  and they are ready and willing to work hard for them. Besides, is chasing after money, power and fame a good thing?<br /><br />This might create the impression that introverts are good whereas extroverts are bad. That is not what the author believes. Both personality types have their flaws and advantages. The two complement each other nicely. They should respect each other and work together rather than compete.
B0095P29EG|5.0|I watched for the second time to get ready for the sequel coming up.  It holds up just us well the second time around.
B006ON41FC|5.0|it's great for kids and adults.  My children play it all the time.  A great app.  you have to be quick.
B005ZTFPFQ|5.0|I am really glad that I purchased this. I like it. I enjoy playing it. This is definitely a great find.
B00COGZ8FU|2.0|Wow, this was bad. Predictable, poorly acted, and just really cheesy. I was not really expecting a great movie, just wanted something entertaining, but it wasn't even that. Can I get my money back?
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The hunger games rock!!!! If you like action,love, and adventure. Your going love the hunger games! This book will be trying to put down something glued to your hands.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|It took me 3 viewings to get all of the facts straight and finally understand the progression, but the storyline is unforgettable!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Very visua and most helpful... the Kindle is not after all an iPhone....<br /><br />Their onboard apps need help and so do we, the customers! Thank you for this...<br />I use it often. it never fails. YOU NEED THIS.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The Blu Ray Combo is, for lack of a better word, awesome. Saw the movie in 3D in the theaters and I had to get it in 3D for the home. A digital copy so you can watch it anywhere you may go. I know I will.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Very readable and you need this. I haven't used it for alarm capability... but the graphics are quite good and<br />usavle... Thank you for this... we need it.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|My daughter saw it and said mom you have to see it. It was very good. Actors were good too the ending was a surprise but enjoyable. I would watch it again.
B0058YPILY|5.0|If you like this show, this is the place to order it....Always the cheapest! Factory sealed and great for presents!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Loved the movie ,but the book is so much better.It is so good when I am reading it feels like I'm there.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|It totally delivered......I was afraid I was expecting too much because of all the hype, but this is one of those movies that totally lives up to all the attention.  It was fabulous!!!  Bradley would have won an Oscar if Daniel Day Lewis had not been in the competition.  And I love love love Jennifer.  They are both extremely talented actors and totally nailed their characters!!!  Bravo!!!
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Amazing book couldn't put it down best book I have read in a long time.  First time I read a sparks novel will defiantly read more.
B002WJI66C|5.0|This version of boo is reallynice.  The tongue can be put into the mouth.  Size is just right. More importantly, it Harwoodqquality construction with most seams being internal.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|IF YOU HAVE THE SPACE THEN GET IT IF YOU HAVE 16 or 32 gb like I do (32 GBP)  It requires 1151&middot;23 Mb<br />BUT ITS WORTH IT<br />THIS IS WORTH THE MONEY ITS VERY FUN
B00AFPTSI0|3.0|Nice ideas, but a bit formulaic and all over the place. It's a one-sided argument and the connections aren't made in a very convincing way.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|GREAT game everybody has got to love it... it has way better graphics then the 1st Temple Run. Everyone please enjoy Temple Run 2!!!!!!!!!!!!-
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|This is an amazing movie.  If you think you know what will happen, you don't and something else happens.  The adolescent is wonderful -- almost as wonderful as The Tiger (&#34;Richard Parker&#34;).  The kid grows up and his life goes on -- and The Tiger returns to the jungle.  If you can handle the shot where The Tiger eats a meercat on Meercat Island, you will love this movie.  I did -- I've ordered my own copy of the movie, and can't wait to watch it again.  And again.
B00CATSONE|4.0|A nice, short read about Tesla for those who do not want a full fledged biography.<br />The author is by no means a really good writer, but this serves as a good sunday afternoon read for all you tesla fans out there.
B005SAJJHM|5.0|There was one show we wanted to see and being able to watch one and not have to buy the entire season was good. A show that just makes you laugh even if it seems a bit silly.
B000002P2V|5.0|long time Who fan. have missed the deep cuts on this album which never get played. Has always been one of my favorites.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I love it because you can make anything a gangster to a pokemon.<br />Over all, the game has basically everything great about it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I don't know what I will do if I didn't have my bible app on my Kendal and my phones ...
B007SXB498|5.0|I've seen many versions of this book in movies with various actors......and i enjoy each of them for different reasons, but when I really want to use my imagination I pull this off the shelf or turn on my kindle..................the romantic side comes out and I'm lost in the small paths and the blue sky dotted with clouds that comes to mind......once again caught up in the opportunities lost and then of other chances and finally grace and acceptance winning in the end.  the lessons learned are always something I need to refresh my self with.  one of my favorite long time loves.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|This is quickly becoming one of my favorite series. Kiera Cass writes this story in a way that I feel like I am living the story as I read it. Can't wait until the next book comes out.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|The games or levels are hard a little and I love wat they did with the fluffys my daughter loves this game thank u so much
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I first heard of them around two years ago and fell in love. They quickly became popular, for good reason. The whole album is pretty incredible. The music is hard hitting, moving, and shows a diversity in tempo and style. Beautifully eclectic. Can't help but song along!
B0097HSS4M|5.0|I am having so much fun with the photo editor+ app. I downloaded it right before my little sisters wedding and used it to take pics while we were getting ready, have been using it all morning on the pics I took and having a blast! This app has so many different options and editing tools to choose from and it's completely simple to use! I love being able to do any editing I want then being able to immediately share my pictures! 5 stars for sure on this app!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game for kids  you should get it for your self or your kids Great game get it now for free
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I could not put this book down. It is Harry Porter for the digital native. It is delicious stew of wonderful ingredients- adventure, friendship, typography, design, San Francisco, technology and the timeless search for immortality.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I really like this game because it's like my own little world and you could do mostly anything like build a house,kill many mobs,and MINE!
B0028MBKVG|5.0|The narrator was very well matched to this book's audio version.  Loved the story and this is on my list of books to revisit in the future.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|I enjoyed this film so much! I am a 14 year-old and it was perfect for my age group. Although there are some scenes that parents might not want their children to see. This is a very violent movie, however it is very stylized and meant to be funny at some parts. There are also a few more risque moments involving teenage sexuality. However this is all looked over because of the great acting, script, and costume design. I would recommend this movie to anyone over the age 14.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|The book was enjoyable to read and the setting in rural Ireland was interesting. The book held my attention as it switched between the protagonist as a boy and the protagonist as a man, yet the outcome was predictable.
B002RI9VVM|5.0|Retained my interest throughout the book. Well written, you can get a good idea of what the times were like.
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|This is a 3 hour movie. About 30 minutes in, you realize that the money spent and time invested was a bad decision. The concept is interesting but the delivery was very poor.
B00B8O4VHU|5.0|I saw this for five bucks at Target, so I tought I'd give it a shot.  I looked at the reviews on my iPhone that compared this to Electric Ladyland.  I scoffed.  Put it in the CD player.  Wow.  Just...wow.  It is not like EL in that the earlier album has some of the most beautiful continuity on any 2 LP set I have ever heard.  SSD has little, if any, continuity.  But I get where the comparison makes sense: SSD, like EL, has extraordinary range, showing us some of the many fascinating directions Hendirx may have taken (jazz, funk, different rock modes, etc.), had he not died so young.  The are a lot of sounds, song structures, etc. that I have not heard elsewhere.  Nor do I find this uneven, like some others do.  Rather, the is a real diversity of styles here that matches any of the albums he released during his lifetime and which easily outpaces anything releaased aftere his death.  I loved his first two records, but I felt they, like Cry of Love, were a tad over produced.  This one has more production than, say, Nine to the Universe or even People, Hell, and Angels, but it actually works quite nicely here.  Well worth the five bucks; worth five times that much, easy.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I love this series, and, as an Amazon Prime member, I enjoyed getting it free!  However, after I watched seasons 1,2, and 3, I was surprised to learn that season 4 is not free to Prime members.  That seems unreasonable; is Amazon just trying to frustrate us and leave us hanging?
B009LHWEKW|5.0|The characters work well together and the show has kept my interest for the last 8 seasons, and hope it lasts through 10.
1449325947|5.0|I have referenced several other CSS books (HTML & CSS: The Good Parts, The Book of CSS3, etc.) and nothing matches this book in terms of comprehensiveness. CSS is a large topic and cutting corners, as other books seem to do, doesn't help a reader who is looking for all of the options before making a decision. Also, I don't agree with the reviewers who have suggested that there is little or no difference between this book and the second edition. When you're looking for expert advice, every little bit counts. For example, the second edition does not cover CSS3's new Multi-column Layout Module, but the third edition does (see page 430).
B009GX69RK|5.0|You'll be watching half a season in a night if you're anything like me. This show only gets better with age.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We were out of the country when this series read.  We could hardly wait to get back home to see what we missed.  This is somoe of the best TV ever broadcast.
B00BF123WG|4.0|Overall, I found \\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" to be very interesting and, at the same time, entertaining. Throughout the movie, which doesn't have a dull moment, I kept wondering if this is what really happened. I assumed it was historically accurate, but I also knew that Hollywood portrays history with a certain degree of flexibility. Turns out I was right after reading several of the reviews provided by a Google search. As exciting as the real story is, it's hard to believe they felt the need to massage any of the facts.<br /><br />Nevertheless, \\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" is an excellent movie that should have easily beaten \\"Argo\\" in the Best Picture category of the 2013 Academy Awards.
B0001ZXM54|5.0|Nice collection of ZZ Top's hits. I was pleased with the album/CD. Having been in the music industry, I do not have anyone artist I follow more than another, but this is a CD I reach for frequently. Music is art, some like some it, some do not, but in this case, if you like ZZ Top, you will enjoy this CD - but it may not be the quintessential ZZ Top CD for some aficionados.
B00AKFG15S|3.0|Nicely written, but the ending is outrageous. Very disappointing.<br />The ending leave you hanging without proper closure. It's like the author had a deadline and he finished the story abruptly.
B004EPYZV2|1.0|This review is for the entire shopping experience and the physical item shipped by Amazon. If you are after a \\"pure\\" movie review I recommend you also see the The Internet Movie Database.<br /><br />I was warned about Paramount and how bad Ultraviolet was. Regrettably, I ignored the warnings.<br /><br />I spent several hours on the Paramount website. I never could get my \\"digital copy\\". Of course, a true digital copy is included in the packaging and is not a download.<br /><br />After many hours all I got from their website was \\"We're sorry, you are ineligible to participate in this offer.\\"
B009T8XBBO|5.0|Highly recommended.  I've only been playing a couple of days, but it's fun and additive already.  Kids will have a good time playing.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|The Power of Habit sheds light and breaks down into pieces what we no longer see in our daily routines. After reading the book I am more aware of what I set about to do every day. Now I question if what If do is a habit and whether it serves my objectives in life, be it personal or professional. I am going to give this book to my shrink, I think he can make use of it also.
B0091REZMW|4.0|So far the game is okay, you do run out of energy, but you can always come back and play later. The HO aren't too hard to find and there are other side missions that keep you busy. So with this being a free game  really can't complain.
B005LAIIHG|1.0|I missed this movie when it was in the theaters, so I was eager to see it as a rental.  I had heard the hype, and I was expecting to be blown away by this film.  On only rare occasions in my life have I been let down to this extent.<br /><br />I borrowed the movie from my local library at the cost of one dollar. It wasn't worth it. The whole time I was watching it I was thinking, \\"What the hell is the point of this movie?? Is it going to get better any time soon??\\" I had to fight to stay awake. It was two hours of my life that went irretrievably down the drain.<br /><br />I am absolutely at a loss to understand how any sane person could rate this movie anything higher than one star. What a profoundly ridiculous premise:  the kid is in a life boat adrift on the ocean along with a tiger, a zebra, an orangutan, and a hyena who take turns getting \\"lost\\" under a tarp that covers the front half of the lifeboat. They somehow magically appear at various times to provide material for each scene. One can almost hear the director out of sight saying, \\"Okay, cue the tiger!\\" The hyena and tiger pose an obvious threat to Pi's existence, but he easily could have just charged them when they were near the edge of the boat and...viola!...into the drink they go. No more threat. Oh wait, I forgot. That would make sense in his struggle for survival, but this is really an utterly pointless movie.
B00BMT9SQA|5.0|I was surprised that this was funny!  I love Barbra Streisand and she is awesome!  Most comedies are not laugh out loud funny, I loved this movie!
B006LSZECO|4.0|The writing is very solid.  You think you know where it's heading but it never quite goes there.  The underlying psychology is very well conceived and the characters have depth.  I was quite impressed.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|this is the very best photo editing app ive ever seen. I cannot find anything wrong with it. it is better than any app ive seen in the apple app store and it lets me add text to pictures, which is something that I can never find no matter where I look! its perfect
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|Waist of my time. If you want to watch this movie I would recommend reading a review and plot details first.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The graphics &amp; sound effects are amazing. Game play took about 2 1/2 hours total for me (and I got stuck a few times). There are hints, but they don't totally give it away, so it's always a challenge. I found myself saying, &quot;Whoa!&quot; a few times, as you really can't even begin to expect what's next. This game gets 5 stars easily! You're really missing out if you don't try it.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|Apart from the actual plane crash - this was a very formulaic B movie. The inclusion of the female drug addict was totally irrelevant to the story line and if - thanks to Don Cheadle - Denzel Washington's blood alcohol level was inadmissible due to poor QC on the instrumentation - how come the flight attendant's was? Utter rubbish - and about 40 mins too long
B000VNMMQQ|5.0|The Movie was  very good the service was the best as far as I am concerned. Thanks for the good job.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app does exactly what you need. When you don't have time to actually get to your bible, simply turn on, find the scripture you need and listen. I find no fault in this app perfect on the go seasons. You will not regret downloading.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This is a awesome app I love playing and overall spending all the time I can on this app I totally love this app
B00BBW16HW|5.0|After watching Intouchables I came to realize that in this crazy, mixed up world  the human spirit and regard for your fellow man can accomplish wonders.  Si vous ne parlez pas francais, c'est n'importe .
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Enjoyed paper edition. Enjoyed Kindle edition even more. So. easily accessible. Would recommend this book to any reader.Gave it 5 stars.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I love this game! It is a lot of fun although I wish you could get creadits without money.<br />I recommend this game
B003E8GQ76|4.0|This is a very well done film. The actors are talented and the story line is intriguing. I just wished for a happier ending!
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|I didn't like it, it was so boring, and very hard to understand, I would tell my friends not to rent this
B009G78EE2|5.0|This is truly a great song with a wonderful message.  A friend posted the video to Facebook and I had to download.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is addictive. I was originally drawn to it because I thought it was historical fiction - which it is, but at its core it's a period piece glamorized soap opera. Acting is excellent, there's always a twist in the storyline, and it's so well-done it even has my husband addicted!  Very fun.
B0031RS42K|1.0|The book is a load of rubbish filled with waffle and far fetched nonsence I found myself skipping pages as the plot was stretched so much, totally unbelievable
B001AIRUOU|5.0|What can I say about this movie that hasn't been said? Amazing, beautiful. I love the music. Nothing that has been done after this was as good. I could watch it 1000 times.
B0081336FO|5.0|If you are not watching this BBC series, you are missing out on some of the best of the best. BBC television is, in general, better than american tv on so many levels; but this series takes it to a while new level of great!
B00008DDSC|4.0|I was pretty pleased with how this movie portrayed the BDSM lifestyle. I loved how Maggie's character is shown how she grew and got better. I wasn't so pleased with some things I saw as a bit reckless from the James Spader character. Knowing you are trying to introduce someone with so many issues into the lifestyle he wasn't as sensitive to that as I would of liked to see. The dominant as predator and submissive as victim is not something that should be shown as the truth of the lifestyle.<br />This movie wasn't hardcore about it, and he did show quite a lot of sensitivity to her and what she was needing to go through. I really enjoyed the development of their relationship and the growth of the characters together. He had a lot of issues too clearly, it wasn't just her.
B00499NHLC|5.0|You can not take your eyes off the screen, you will miss something, and believe me you don't want to miss anything.
0345522478|5.0|I am really enjoying this series. especially the first few books. I feel as the series goes the books are not as strong. But here in the beginning was the best of Atticus and his hound!<br />Really fun story, how could you not love Atticus!
B009R659L8|5.0|I  am an avid fan of Mary Higgins Clark, any book by her is bound to be WONDERFUL and this book liked up to my expectations.  There were several twists to the plot but once I got them straightened out I could follow with out any trouble.  Thanks Mary for all the wonderful books you write.
0545128285|3.0|Good addition to the world of Harry Potter but not a great book. It was cute and was good to get when not wanting the story to end.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Another great game with a better price!  I must say that I've spent a great deal of time playing this time, and should have been doing more productive stuff, but, oh well, I have to play it.  I have no choice.  :-)
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|It was clear that Danial Day-Lewis played Lincoln well.<br />My issue with this movie is that it just felt so slow. I guess this is history, and you can't always make that exciting.<br /><br />So I cannot say t was a bad movie, it just was too slow for me. Not sure if it was when I watched it or what but I stopped it half way through.
B004AQR29C|3.0|Lots of explosions and violence. A typical Stallone movie. Pretty nice auto race scene near the beginning of the movie.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Beautiful movie. Husband wanted to watch this and I was only a little interested. The movie started and I was hooked. We sat on the couch on a Saturday afternoon watching this and we both loved it so much.<br />We immediately looked up to see if this was a true story or anything like that. We also picked up the book.<br /><br />It was a beautiful movie, the colors, the cinematography. It was breathtaking. I was so stunned by the explanation at the end, I wanted to know what was real and what wasn't. I highly recommend this movie.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Very fun game and easy for children and adults to understand. Extremely colorful and lifelike features, quickly regenerates sand dollars and alge so y
0385349947|5.0|I loved this book! I have read it non stop. I am thankful to Sheryl for writing this manifesto and sharing her life experiences with us. I loved it because it appeals to the strengths of women and not to women victims. Every woman should read this book which speaks directly to the heart and to the intellect of women of any age or status.<br />I do believe women should take their share in public life and leadership positions and  they most possibly will succeed where patriarchy has  failed. We should demand, as Sheryl did, our right to have a fair share with men of all rights, care, tasks and responsibilities of public and private life. Let's start the Coalition of Women, to make our world a better place to live, for women and men!<br />Again, warm congratulations to Sheryl Sandberg!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Very Gorey and lots of sex. Not suited for children. I love watching it tho, it will blow your mind. Loved it so much went and bought it along with season 2 at the local bestbuy.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I realy like this game.  It gives me a lot of creativity and i realy just love it. So if i were you i would get it. Wow price dropped
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Can't wait till season 4 starts to air I'm so on that. You never know who's next to go. Some episodes that are in here were major time filler tho.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book  was the most erotic romance novel  that i have ever read.  If  you have never had sex this could be a  Bible<br /> for it.  IT. Does go overboard some times.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|The best movie based from a comic book. Trust me and the reviews that everyone is putting out. Never mind the popular franchise of DC and Marvel... This is how a comic movie should be done. With respect.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Wouldn't call it a family film, really, because it may scare little kids. I think all of the teens and grown ups who like action comics will enjoy it.
B005HSL626|4.0|good  very good the beast it<br />the game is awesome fruit ninja is the best ninja ninja lets play fruit ninja yea its very very fun yea
B0049J2BSM|5.0|the whole family enjoyed it, laughed most of the way through it, and like to watch it again and again. I recommend it to other grandparents.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|love this game had it on my old phone and used to play it for hours but its a little glitchy thats all
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|great group, great album, wish they toured more.  in line with all their other music and very good stuff.  thanks
B000N3ST7A|5.0|Stevie Nicks is simply amazing.  What a voice and talent to write all these iconic songs. A &#34;must&#34; have in your collection. Even better when played full blast.
B00BS1VVIU|5.0|I was looking forward to the first full-length release from Daughter and it did not disappoint. The songs are heart-wrenching and poetic lyrics balanced with some very dynamic layers of sound. Daughter is one of those bands who manages to create songs that just feel familiar right away - not because they are predictable but because the intimacy draws you in immediately.<br /><br />Some standouts are:<br />Youth - Starts out soft and builds nicely with some of my favorite lyrics: &#34;If you're still breathing, you're the lucky ones. 'Cause most of us are heaving through corrupted lungs&#34;<br /><br />Smother - A quiet song with delicate guitar and ethereal backing vocals<br /><br />Human - This one has bolder vocals with a driving guitar and solid beat.<br /><br />If you like this album check out their earlier EPs. They are amazing too!
B005PK57NU|4.0|Because of my Prime Membership I started to watch this series.  It's an interesting series that keeps you wanting to watch more.  I'm sad that the 4th season is not free with our membership :( ...but I'm still watching.
B002RKSCA6|5.0|Fun when you don't have a lot of extra time to get deep into a novel.  Still eerie even though it's an old story.  I didn't notice any problems with the Kindle Edition.
B00COGY2P2|2.0|But there is no way to take this movie seriously.  It is so overdone -- the acting is terrible, the dialogue worse.  Even the action scenes are boring.  You can tell this movie was produced by Tom Cruise because it tries so hard to make him look like &#34;the man&#34; in every scene.  It fails...miserably.  Will be a long time before I watch another Cruise production -- like never.
B003VPWXRO|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this.  It's well-written and interesting, but I've always liked memoirs.  I'm a Portia fan, too, so I might be biased.
B001LMAK88|5.0|I really enjoyed this action packed western. Lot's of well known actors in it. I would recommend this movie to anyone that likes westerns with a flair.
0671646788|5.0|Great book!  Emphasis on the power your perspective can have on your life.  Great book for a new graduate or someone just looking for a change.  The theories in the book stay with you and are considered as you go through life's changes.
B001LRJH0U|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. Wish they had choosen another actress. It's not that Miss Zeliwiger is a bad actress, I just think she didn't fit this movie.
0312323867|5.0|Quick, easy read ... and I am not a reader.  Well written  and interesting story.  Worth taking the time.  She has others in that are also good
1400069289|5.0|I titled this review \\"Something for Everyone\\" for a reason.  This book has lots of stories about many different people, some of whom are well known, and how habits shaped their lives.<br /><br />If you are a football fan, you might appreciate the story of how Tony Dungy used habits to build the Bucs and the Colts.<br /><br />If you are an alcoholic, you might appreciate the story of Bill Wilson.<br /><br />If you are a gambler, you should read the story of Angie Backmann.<br /><br />If you are a chronic nail biter, read Mandy's story.<br /><br />If you are an executive, you've got to read the story of Paul O'Neill's unusual success at Alcoa.<br /><br />If you're a doctor, nurse, or hospital administrator, read the story about the problems at Rhode Island Hospital and how they were overcome.<br /><br />If you want to know the significance of the marshmallow experiment with children, read the book.<br /><br />If you know someone with dementia, read the book.<br /><br />If you want to know how Pastor Rick Warren built his huge congregation, read the book.<br /><br />If you want to know why even the prosecutor told the jury to acquit the defendant in a murder case, read the book.<br /><br />I couldn't put this book down!  It drew me in like a novel (except it's better than a novel because it's true).<br /><br />The only thing that this book doesn't do is the actual hard work of changing your habits for you.  That's something no book can do.  But it does lay out the steps that you can take if you want to change your habits.  This is a must read!
B00005JKEZ|5.0|Thanks for the promot service and excellent dvd.<br />Enjoy it very much and would be happy to work with you again.<br /><br />All best<br />Tana
B009949RKC|4.0|This is a typical teen ager movie, made for teen agers.  I am definitely not a teen ager.  I watched this movie because I had heard it mentioned over the years as a classic and I like Sissy Spacek.  Not too bad.  Entertaining.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is a family friendly game. It can be addictive, but it's lots of fun to play.  I recommend it to anyone wanting a simple game to play.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|The download for the Android works great and will be using it more as I learn more, it is new for me now.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|Jumps don't get shorter the faster it gets so it's almost not fair. I would like it to be a bit more rewarding.
0785168109|5.0|I'm a big Iron Man fan, and I thoroughly enjoyed the third movie in the franchise. This artbook covers all the concept art and designs I could hope for, with a particular emphasis on Tony's new suits. Some highlights:<br /><br />- A foldout poster of all 42 Iron Man suits (the Iron Legion) with the nicknames Tony gave them, such as \\"Nightclub\\", \\"Romeo\\", and \\"Hot Rod\\". Designs range from classic red and gold to streamlined black stealth suit to a beautiful silver-white deep-space suit, which was inspired by NASA shuttles. There is an entire chapter devoted just to concept art of the suits and description of their special functions.<br /><br />- Concept art of the Mandarin, including a detailed rendition of his cape (which is surprisingly intricate!) and two full pages devoted just to his rings. You can see the jewels and etchings on each of them.<br /><br />- Sketches of Tony's homemade weapons! There's a super 77 flame thrower, a saw blade thrower, and many others. Apparently, the propmaster actually based some of the designs on real, functional weapons people have made.<br /><br />- Storyboards of the helicopter gunship attack on Tony's mansion and the sequence where Iron Man saves all the people who get blasted out of the airplane.<br /><br />- Finally, my favorite part is at the end: the artists drew a bunch of cartoons depicting creative ways each of Tony's suits kill off Extremis soldiers in the final seaport battle. Some of them are really funny, like when the deep-space suit sticks a jet pack on an Extremis dude and blasts him into space, or the black suit splits into pieces to \\"divide and conquer\\" an army of Extremis.<br /><br />Definitely a worthwhile purchase for a fan, or anyone interested in all the Iron Man suits that you saw in the film! I have a huge respect for the artists, costume designers, and prop people who made sure every little detail of the movie came to life. (Seriously, they took a month to do all the illustrations for the Mandarin's rings!)
B003G4W49C|3.0|It was an interesting read but the way children were used for adult purposes and forced to be adults at times and used as pawns at other times bothered me. It made the book unrealistic to me. But you can't deny that this author is a genious for creating such a book.
0807014273|5.0|This book made me cry & think. I wept for the things that Dr Frankl experienced, but I still found myself thinking about the theory that was forming due to what he was going through.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|I' have been trying to decide if Cloud Atlas or Judge Dredd was the worst movie I have ever seen? What was that? What was it about? Anytime you're 3 quarters of the way through a movie and have no idea what it is about something went wrong. I could have left the room and come back 3 quarters of the way in and known about the same. Hanks is not Murphy. Again, What was that? The movie should come with a triple shot of Java. My whole family and friends felt the same way if you're thinking I'm just daft.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|This isn't just a Disney movie for children; adults should like it also. It's clean, humorous but I do warn I wouldn't recommend for very young children. There is some violence; you would have to be the judge. I've watched it a dozen times at the very least. Although there are no children at home anymore, I would gladly play it for my older grand-children with their parent's permission.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|The game has many new obstacles and characters, and this cut the rope is the best on yet (to me).
B00AFROVQC|1.0|This book was incredibly poorly written.  I thought a child had written it.  The timeline was unbelievable (the whole book seemed to happen in a week), the characters undeveloped and plot all over the place.  Don't bother!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I reall y enjoyed this movie. At first, I thought it was going to be just a teen movie. However, it  was much more.
B003Z0BWRM|5.0|I really love this contemporary magic story.  It is well written and developed with strong characters and a cohesive plot - you can't wait to get the next book.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|wow you should play this game it will frek you out! WOW so freken scary.how do you get away from slender man he is always behind you. SO FREKIN SCARY!
B0053JJLLC|3.0|This isn't a *bad* book, it's just not *great* in the way some of Michael Crichton's earlier works are. If I was just starting out reading Crichton's work then I might think differently, but it &#34;jars&#34; in a way the majority of the rest of his work doesn't. It's small things (ironic given the subject matter of the book) like the repetitive use of the character's full names - Peter Jansen, not just Peter, etc. - that I found annoying. As a movie script or screenplay it works and I can't help feeling that's the point: given the current sophistication of special effects technologies like CGI this could easily be translated to a movie or TV mini-series - the book is neatly divided into set pieces and scenes, complete with cliff hangers (like the scene with the centipede or the one with the Huntsman spider). At the end of the day, I just don't enjoy that style of narrative - it's impersonal, and that's the main problem for me with the book: by the time I was half-way through the book I found I didn't have any emotional attachment to the characters which given the body count probably wasn't a bad thing. So, not &#34;great&#34; Crichton, but not &#34;bad&#34; either. I came away knowing a lot more about the fauna and flora of Hawaii, so I don't think I wasted my time reading this, but it's not a book I could recommend to my friends and family.
B0018OFN2W|4.0|The only bad thing about it was it didn't have Vin Diesel. Otherwise its a very enjoyable and fun movie. Cool cars. Cool driving and races. Good actors. Good movie all around.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game is another great game from G5-- I couldn't put it down. I hope they keep making fun and exciting games.....I have played almost everyone they have put out.... Keep up the GREAT WORK!!
B0018OFN1S|4.0|Cool movie. Made me want to watch the others in this series. Everything about it was enjoyable. Nothing to not like about it really. A good movie for teens such as myself.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|this game is the best game I played on the kindle fire yet.  u get all yhe armour in iron man 3.
B005OYKI1I|5.0|The best in the series by far. Its also good if you just like action movies. Good actors and cool cars. Check it out.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|This game is the best flying game if ever played although I wished they also made were you can fight in the ground.
B000J2BRQU|3.0|This is the worst one in the series. That doesn't mean its all bad. It has cool cars and driving but that is about it. Watch it just so you know what happenes and how it connects to the others.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|So cool seeing the twists they put on all of the classic fairy tales. Can't wait to see how the next season unfolds.
B002LANLDK|5.0|Not as good as Fast Five but still one of the best. Has a crazy cliffhanger ending! This movie has Vin Diesel in it this time and nearly everything else that makes the other Fast/Furious movies enjoyable. Worth seeing.
B005HF0GKC|5.0|i really like these shows. i missed some but i can catch up now.i like i can watch them anytime
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I don't know when I have ever enjoyed television more than when watching Downton Abbey. The writers and actors have captured something that is truly captivating for the viewer. I watched long stretches of this during the cold snowy days that were good for little else. Looking forward to another season.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|My kids absolutely love this app... it has pretty colors and fun activities... it keeps them occupied for hours on end...
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I have really enjoyed this series and had caught a few episodes here and there on television so it was really good to be able to watch from the beginning in proper order. Very well written and excellent quality acting. Worth every penny.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|You should add a black plague desiese with the ones you can buy in addition to necro and mind worm
B005723JSQ|5.0|Quick and light hearted.  Catchy from the start.  Kinsella never disappoints with a good love story in the end. Great for poolside this summer.
B006O6FK2W|2.0|I was really excited to see this to on amazon for the price, but when I got it I was disappointed. It wasn't as good a it seemed. It came new and I had bought for my nephew, and if I would of known it would get jammed at the first time batman got shot out, I wouldn't of purchased it. The blasters work fine and if you have a batman figure it fits but I think that is all my nephew will really use it for.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Lots of action as expected. Thought that plot was pretty convoluted but that's to be expected as well. Daniel Craig and Judi Dench were very good but Javier Bardem stole the show with his off the wall depiction of an evil maniac. Would have rated it higher if the plot was a little more believable.
B004PVKFR8|2.0|I got the album due to Sail, however, the only other song I enjoy is &#34;Not your fault&#34;  anyway, maybe the album will grow on me...
B001BC5HXG|5.0|Fantastic read---lots to think about regarding this family --our book club had one of the best discussions in a long time.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|is so cool! many strong men has beard eat food and beer and get woman because so cool! you like it
1442366621|5.0|good information.  the author makes it simple to understand and gives good stories for reference.  would recommend it to others.
B008602KQI|3.0|The movies was done okay, I just really don't like violent movies. Watched it on Amazon Prime - so easy!
B0026RHR6K|5.0|I love this show. great box sex came with a free toy. the box is kindof big i just tool the dvd sets<br /> out of the big box .
B0009XNUK0|5.0|The title says it all, &#34;Essential&#34;!  With all the favorites, this is the perfect well constructed, extra-large dose of Michael!
3822856282|4.0|It's not for everyone but i liked it i used it for some talking points in a photography class i took a few years ago.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I wish I'd have been able to read this ten years earlier. It's right on time though and her perspective and research is great.
B000EUDAWG|3.0|Its fun kindof looks real, and is good fun at a party. if you want a r/c spider than its the one for you.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Excellent game and it's a lot harder to beat than you think. Gives the old brain a good workout. Outstanding
B00CDT41RY|2.0|For a movie set in the years just prior to the Civil War, these characters were remarkable in their twenty first century manifestations and mannerisms.  Mr. Waltz was the only actor that was worth watching for his talent and the only character of interest.  The movie was ok up to the time of the entrance of Mr. DiCaprio, then another movie started which I really didn't care to watch.<br /><br />Once this other movie started we had to wait a long time for the obligatory bloody retribution scenes to play out.  The music was terribly out of place.  I suggest the Director watch the Coen's brother's True Grit to see how a period movie with good acting and interesting characters is made.  But, I suspect this movie had other goals which I have yet to discover.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Very fun game and addictive to play . Great game for kids and adults. you can upgrade the vehicles and earn coins to open new levels.
B00B5P37IG|1.0|NO STREAMING TV FOUND ON THIS APP ON MY KINDLE FIRE HD. WHAT AM I DOING WRONG? tHERE IS NO INSTRUCTIONS WITH THIS APP, OR DID I MISS THEM?
B0053O89KG|5.0|Great show.  I have all 4 seasons on dvd now and can't wait for season 5 to be out on dvd too.
B00493E1GI|5.0|I seriously liked this movie. It is very realistic and it touches your soul in different ways. It is truly showing that some times you can lose balance in your life but regain it again if you have determination. I highly recommend this movie. It is a piece of art!
B009H442DG|5.0|was so  good  to hear  john  and  oliva  singing together  again<br />both  are  such  good  hearted  people  .  adore  them both
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|There are a few things that don't perfectly match up with the earlier two movies, but you have to nitpick to come up with them.
B009AMANH4|4.0|Movie was long, but interesting. thought it was more of his whole life, but very well done covering the Civil War period of his presidency.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game was amazing! The level of detail was great, like many others said, it's challenging but not impossible. Wonderful!
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|This is a long movie, so get comfy.<br /><br />Kind of out of sequence since the Lord of the Rings movies came out first, but true to the book.
1582701709|5.0|When the book was recommended to me, I bought it as a courtesy to the person who told me about it.  It sat on my shelf for a few months until another person told me about how excited he had become about his life after he had read it.  I began reading it that night and every page made me look at myself and demonstrated that I needed to read the next page, and the next.  I recommended it to the men in my therapy group and every one of them read it and the excitement spread to the whole unit of inmates of the prison where I worked!!!  A true testament to the quality & content of this inspiring book!!!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Enzo stole my heart from the first page. Garth Stein's ability to capture the tribulations of being a dog (no thumbs) and the poignancy of unconditional love held my heart throughout.<br />Anyone who has been around dogs will understand immediately.
1419381032|3.0|I have not begun to listen to this book as it is third in the series.  I am still listening the to second book &#34;Dragonfly in Amber.&#34;  I looked at the surfaces of the discs and they look good.  I'm sure I will like the book as I have read it and loved it.  I wanted the audio book to listen to in the car.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game!!  Easy to understand and play and addictive....Hours of fun and enjoyment.Good graphics..Great to be able to choose how you want to play the game.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I really like this movie. Casting and effects all are done well. It did pretty good at following the spirit of the book.  I recommend reading the book also.
B00AB0Z88S|4.0|This is a good movie and is available in 3D, which is why we purchased.  Having read the reviews, we thought it would be awesome but, if purchasing in 3D for those effects, it is not as good as the deep sea 3D's available for $5 or so.  However, it is a good movie and am not sorry to have purchased, just don't even remember now - 2 months later - any particular 3D moments.  Avatar is really the best 3D movie so far, excepting the deep sea 3D's, which really jump out at you!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I luv it!!!! It's so fun. Little kids, big kids and adults can have fun with it. I luv when it gets faster, and I luv that u can compete with ur friends on Facebook
B005LAIII0|5.0|Honestly, I didn't have any intention on watching this movie because I seriously thought that it was a movie about a boy and his tiger.......well, i was wrong..It was so much more than that! The movie was great and I highly reccomend it to all to watch with the entire family.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Great story that combines two of Nelson DeMilles best characters.  I can't wait to read about what happens next in this series.
0345528581|5.0|This is an excellent book!  People don't realize just how great of a workout you can get using their body.
B00957T6X6|5.0|The book bundle is worth every penney. Once you read one you have to read the rest. Some times the books seem to get bogged down in details but, the details really make the story come to life.
B006M4F67A|5.0|It's a game that makes you think and watch what you are doing. Good pass time. It was a free game and it's one of the better ones.
B005IQZB14|5.0|candid, inspiring, interesting, sad, hopeful, amazing - Everything I look for in a book that I want to transport me.  I took it on a beach vacation to Hawaii, and couldn't put it down.  Beautifuy written.
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|I admit it, i have a bias for the band. They where great then and still are, what else can i say..lol
B004TI1WME|5.0|While a calculator pretty much does the same thing, math, this one has one advantage over others that I have had, a virtual tape. So many times I wish I could review the numbers entered, or the arithmetic key struck? With this app I can see just that information. I don't think it does a lot more than add, subtract, multiply, divide, percentage etc, but those are pretty much what one needs of an OFFICE calculator anyway.
B0089LOKHG|1.0|I fell in love with this series- it was such an interesting concept and the first book was amazing so if course j had to finish th series. But there was absolutely no resolution!!! Spoiler Alert: Alex admits he still loves Lena, who says she has always loves Alex, but now it's complicated because of Julian. Predictable. But that's where th book ends. WHAT?! Maybe I'm missing some poetic symbolism because Lena can choose and has the freedom and yada yada yada. But this is in the middle of a revolt for crying out loud! If the author was going for some powerful, symbolic ending, it could have been executed much more effectively. It feels like she couldn't decide how to end it so she just cut it off. I DEMAND AN EPILOGUE. Did Hana live or die? What happened to Fred? Where is Lena's and Grace's family? Was the revolt a success? What happens after this? Do they start a revolution? Do they gain the freedom to love? What about Cassie? And if course, who does Lena choose and what happens to the other? Too many unanswered questions!! Inconclusive and aggravating! A thoroughly disappointing end to such a promising series.
B006M4F67A|4.0|I use games on my phone to kill time waiting for an appointment. I don' like long, multilevel games needed people to send coins, chips, tickets, lives, or bonus moves. This one fits the bill. Got a few minutes, do a mahjong stack. The game is easy, though on my phone some of the tiles are a little hard to read. Good game.
B005HNMPBM|5.0|Not bad for a prequel... the acting was well done.  Give a better back story for Magneto...  Wolverine only in one small scene...
B00B2V66VS|2.0|It is an interesting game and my grandchildren like to play it, but it takes more practice that I am willing to devote to a game. I play games to kill a little time and I don't have this much time. One needs to practice this one.
B009AMANBA|1.0|Turned it off. Acting for president lincoln was soo cheesy. Badly written and directed too. I cant believe this movie was 2.5 hours long. Who wants to watch this? History is in a book and every time they put it on tv they butcher it.
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|I got this for my grandson - he has a great time with it; just as it is just as expected!!
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|really good movie!<br /><br />little too violent in the beginning of the movie.<br />but a lot good action, throuth the whole movie
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|Rather depressing considering that it's labeled as a comedy. If you're looking to get a few laughs and have your fiance question your relationship, this is the one.
B00B49L7JY|4.0|good!<br /><br />very nice directed.<br />go to the end, step by step, without showing whats coming next.<br /><br />excellent develop history and very emotional.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|this game is poopy cuz its stupid. so moo you and its poop. poo poo poo I hate it so bad stupid gravity
B000002H6C|5.0|one of the best production by Metallica<br /><br />very nice systematization of music, mixing together.<br /><br />low, high, fast, slow. simple awesome.<br />great.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's. an enjoyable game for killing time. Some are incredibly easy, and some are so aggravating! This game tests the mind.
1609613937|5.0|I have spent my life paying out Vegetarians and Vegans - mocking their lack of animal products in their diet and now I'm strictly following Dr McDougals plan myself.  I'm a 47 year old female and the results have been incredible for me.  My energy levels have soared physically.  And mentally I'm feeling incredibly clarity.  This book is so easy to understand.  I've always had very hair trigger blood sugar levels which led me to believe starch was not suitable for me - so I've always tried eating low carb and animal protein to try and keep my blood sugar stable.  But I'm amazed at how even I feel eating this complex starch based diet with no animal products.  I can't tolerate gluten or nightshades so potato isn't suitable for me either and that limits my choices to predominately brown rice - most people won't be as limited as me - but I'm happy to eat like this because the trade off in feeling so well is really worth it - I also had my blood tests done and my sugars were down - and my cholesterol was great !  I really recommend this book to anyone - but especially if you're health isn't great and you want to improve your digestion and energy levels.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I could not wait for season 3 to post to HULU PLUS- so glad it was available and easy to buy for my ROKU through Amazon Prime!!!!
B005IZLPMY|4.0|As far as superhero movies go, this is a good one. The story is not as cliche as most which is good, but there are too many slow parts to the movie given its genre. Essentially 90% of the action is packed into the final 30 minutes.<br /><br />That being said, it is still a really good movie and the visuals are really good, not much of a surprise for anything produced in the past fifteen years. It is just not as good of a movie as, say, the first Ironman, in my opinion.
B004A8ZWWO|5.0|I couldn't wait to see the movie in the theatre, and was excited to find it on Amazon. I will enjoy watching it again with family and friends.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|By now you know the movies and either love them or hate them. Other reviewers have gone into great detail about the technical quality of the Blu-rays. I will summarize this based on my experience.<br /><br />This is the last Star Wars I will need to buy. The image and sound quality is spot-on given the age of the film. I can tell they did quite a bit of work to clean it up without ruining it with any new enhancements. There are several places in the films where the sound volume was off by quite a bit: certain lines were very loud or soft compared to everything else. This has all been corrected on the Blu-rays. Image-wise, there are places where the video is very sharp, and others where it is more grainy. This is actually a good thing in my opinion, it means it is as true to the original as possible and Lucas did not decide to change even more things.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|What can I say? Great talent, great voice, very entertaining. This is a great addition to my Christmas selection.  I recommend buying it.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|yeah this game is awesome. i recently got a kindle for my birthday in March, and now i am the biggest shark i could possibly be :) my boyfriend constantly looks at me and says &#34;oh REALLY, MORE shark attack?! you go girl&#34; haha i love it, and he knows he loves it too. awesome fun game to pass time
0802473156|5.0|My sweet husband and I attended a couples retreat, many of the classes used this book for the lessons, examples, and goals to improve marriages.
B0063IH60K|5.0|many options for however you like to play, plus you can change the background and cards and sizes. come on, you cant go wrong with solitaire :)
B00008OE4W|5.0|This movie is filled with talented actors, awesome suspense, and an interesting plot. I recommend it for all ages anywhere.
B000N2HCKQ|5.0|I communicate for a living ... and I've got the PowerPoint presentations to prove it. Bullet points were my bread and butter. Yesterday, my 5 hour training session on church growth had one session of data dump and one session of five stories. Guess which one was sticky ... If you communicate for a living, read this book. Please.
B002ZG98Z0|3.0|I loved Sex and the City the movie! It was wonderful! But this movie did not compare. Disappointed. Carrie meets Aiden , of all people on a trip and kisses him! I just always thought that Big was the man for her. And they are married now.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I have read and loved all of the Sookie Stackhouse novels. This is actually by far one if not my most loved. I called the ending way back at the beginning of the series and am so excited with this ending. It`s not what most readers were expecting and I am glad Charlaine wrote it this way! I am so sad this series is over  as I look forward to each new bo. Books like these should go on forever... can`t wait until October to see if Skokie gets her happy ending!!!! Thanks for all the good reads!!!!
B00377V6J2|5.0|Two of the greatest guitar legends in history riffing off each other. If you love either/or Albert King or Stevie Ray Vaugan, or you just admire great guitarist, buy it.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|This is a movie that demands your attention.  The subtle character connections are hard to follow unless you pay attention.  A rare movie indeed.  Many movies I have the plot down in the first half and then my attention wanders.  This was a challenge to watch.
B002UNMW7O|4.0|Not as good as the first one, but still fun. Violent of course. Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flanery are just as adorable with 10 years under thier belts.
0525953728|5.0|Very good expose of the UBL Raid, from an Assaulter from DEVGRU.<br />Every American should read this book about how the raid went down.<br />And almost turned into a disaster.
0307454568|4.0|Was reading the trilogy of GIRL books.  Needed this one to complete the three.  This book did not disappoint me.  Hated that the author passed.  i am sure there would have been more books.  Rated it this way because i saw all three movies and the book does the movies justice.
B00COGZ8FU|1.0|I just can't get past the ridiculous casting of Cruise as the 6'-4&#34;, 250-pound hero of the Jack Reacher books!
B00B9366VO|3.0|Good so far as the focus on the Neve board and the studio itself. But McCartney? Really? That was a bit too much.
B00BUCXVPI|5.0|Very entertaining. Good plot and well played characters. Cruise was superb. His character, Jack Reacher, is guided by doing right and obtaining justice inspite of the law.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|We were visiting my parents for the weekend, and my mom had picked this movie for an evening's entertainment for our kids. I took a quick glance at the case cover and figured I'd get some work done while the kids watched what I assumed would be a kiddie movie.<br /><br />But once I started it up for them, I couldn't take my eyes off of it. After a while I finally had to pause it to make the popcorn for the kids; couldn't bear to miss a moment of it.<br /><br />This is a truly great movie; one for the ages. Many excellent reviews have been given here with lots more details, so I won't repeat here what you've read in several hundred other reviews. Just wanted to chime and in and say \\"Wow, this is great\\".
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|This is such an underrated show. It has some great action sequences and an excellent thematic score, but it also has a ton of subtleties that make it worth watching and re-watching. The various nuances of Cromartie vs Cameron vs Weaver and how they all interact with the humans around them. Fantastic stuff. Such a bummer it got canceled but we should appreciate what we did get!
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|Great game. You can get very far for free. Getting enough glu credits, without buying them, to get the really good stuff is really hard.
0061122416|4.0|The Alchemist - Paulo Coelho<br /><br />This novel is about a young man, Santiago who has reoccurring dreams about a treasure that could be found in the pyramids. He ponders what to do about his dreams by seeking out a gypsy who tells him once he finds his treasure that she would like in payment of interpreting his dream one tenth of payment when he finds his treasure. He comes upon a man who reveals himself to be the King of Salem and gives him some sound advice. Santiago sells his sheep and sets out from Tarif, Spain to travel to Egypt. Along his way Santiago encounters many people who come into his life. As in our own lives we have many people who enter our lives for any given reason whether they're there for a moment, a week, month, or years to help us on our quest of life. Some of these lessons may push us in the positive way or a negative way. One must listen to our surroundings or look for signs, or omens that we are headed in the right direction.<br /><br />Eventually Santiago reaches his destination to find that what he sought was not actually there but where he had least expected it to be was right under his nose in his homeland. Sometimes, one must travel to learn our lessons to complete our spiritual quest.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|This game has so many forms  of playing mahjong 2D, 3D and all sorts different modes to play mahjong, it's a really big challenge and a good brain game.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|In life, I am so glad I don't have to be the judge or the jury of anyone else. People are complex and never all good or bad. But, the killers Dexter locates and annihilates have nothing to do with real life. They are always 100% evil and need to be 100% exterminated. He is the only complicated one playing the game.
B007AL48UK|5.0|I have this game,but I've been so busy lately I have not found time to play the game.  Looking forward to playing this game.
B0060D0R2C|5.0|the his was a great movie, actors we're best for their part in the movie . wouldn't it be nice to be able to go back in time and change parts of life or something that happened and change it . if you haven't seen it before you need to watch it .
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|If you don't feel something when you watch this, check to make sure you still have a pulse. Acting was really well done as was the tsunami scene.
B0060D0HJK|5.0|I think this was a great movie. I liked it because it brought back home a person's life. She found out who she really is and what life is all about. This movie and Pure Country, same. Both going back to their roots.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Dumb ending!  Thought it would end with baby being born. With Grey having become less dominate. Something more exciting.  Yucky
0812550706|4.0|I loved Enders Game and read the subsequent books in the series. I googled Orson Scott Card after reading the books and became very bum'd out. I will never read another book by this author or see the upcoming movie ... nor will I let my children. I do not share Mr. Card's political views on basic human rights. I am for equal rights. I am for mutual respect and acceptance.
B000OVLINI|3.0|Difficult to get into and I am having a hard time staying with it.  I keep going back, but I may give up.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is super addictive! Even when you run out of coins, that makes you want to sell a prizefighter just to get more coins to continue playing.  It's great!
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|The kids loved the movie, the graphics were amazing and the kids will be watching it over and over!  The digital copy will come in handy!
B005FDW7AI|5.0|I love this movie. It is great for children's self-esteem and it is inspirational, especially for little princesses! It's Lovely!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Such a great game.  The game is kind of touchy though,like sometimes I want to hit something and I end up hit the expand your land button<br />and I end up spending either money or acorns when I do NOT want to.<br />Other than that it is a great game!
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|I tried this app one night because I misplaced my cell with the alarm clock on it and this app did not work for me. Not sure why! Oh well! : ). Maybe later!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Good plot twists, entertaining writing, keeps you reading--you can't put this book down. Recommended to many of my good friends
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|My kids both love this game.  The also liked Temple Run as well.  Seems very fast paced but they like this.  Great game for kids!
B009LHWEKW|4.0|miss some of the old charachters killed off....glad to see Castelle return...enjoyed seeing Amanda Tapping...a little more romance this season would have been nice......some of the silly episodes are not that entertaining
B00B2TE7FC|5.0|I first heard of Walk Off The Earth from a posted link of \\"Someone That I Used To Know\\" on a cross country ski area site (WhiteGrass.com) in West Virginia. A beautiful place, by the way. Anyway, since then I have traveled along all the You Tube postings of WATE and found I was always left smiling, dancing, contemplating  and wondering of more.<br /><br />When R.E.V.O. came out I had to buy it. Never wondering if I would be disappointed; I was left even more amazed.<br /><br />I think what holds me most of there music is that there is no one lead vocalist; like a great group of great talented friends gladly gathering all there grand talents together.<br /><br />To quote from there song \\"Gang of Rhythm\\", \\"Let's gather round and sing a song\\", I think says a lot....<br /><br />If ever, Walk Off The Earth, you are traveling through western Maryland you will always be welcome here.
B009AMANH4|5.0|It is often difficult to measure President Lincoln by just reading history books. This movie puts &#34;flesh&#34; on the &#34;bones&#34; of the history books. It helps make him real to the modern day. It provides the &#34;non-verbal&#34; aspects that words cannot provide. This movie deserves the accolades that it received. Well worth watching.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I have had no problems with this app on my 1st gen kindle fire. I find this app very handy.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Couldn't stop watching it!! Stayed up the whole weekend and watched the whole first season in two nights! Best show I have watched in a log time.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I like iron man so this game to me is awesome so I rated it 5<br />So I guess bye
B0067TGSOK|2.0|.. he writes books like this. If you have the wherewithal to write a book or start up a web-based business where you don't really make anything (the vast majority of examples are in this category), you probably don't need this book. The author does describe some &#34;real&#34; businesses, but no way those got started on $100.
B0043WHRWA|4.0|I like castle very much! I forgot how I came to watching Castle, but I like it very much! But I watch all the time!
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|Mildly entertaining action flick, but no clue what makes Jack tick. Is that how the books are?<br />But perfectly acceptable rental if you need a break from rom-coms.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|One of the most interesting hours on Sunday night.  A fun way to spend time watching the twists and turns.  Too bad the commercials get in the way.
B00BF11STU|4.0|Good movie. Don't avoid it because of the buzz about the torture scenes. Torture scenes in Savages were much worse. Taut well paced plot line. And a very satisfying ending.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Because of the Man who became a hero like Sgt. Kyle the book deserves five stars but the writing of the book where both he and his wife narrated detracted from the prose.  He was a real American to be proud of.  There are many Americans who we can be prooud of.  In example General John Vessy.  A kid from Minnesota who joined the Army Natl Guard as a private at Camp Ripley in Central MN, recieved a field commission for bravery and leadership during WWII and rose to the rank of 4 star General and was appointed by Pres. Raegan as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. He remains in his home near Mil Lacs Lake in MN.  Sgf. Kyle deserved the same long life.
B0099G3I96|2.0|No doubt had always been a bit of a guilty pleasure of mine since I first heard &#34;spiderwebs&#34; on KROQ in 1996. This album just isn't a lot of fun.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|This is the best game that I have ever played.If you want to buy the app and then, don't buy it... You are making a huge mistake.
B000025RHI|1.0|This release by VP sounds terrible. Like it was recorded off a warped, tinny old cassette or something. They shouldn't be allowed to sell it like this. It's a shame this classic album isn't available in a better audio quality.
B007L6VR6M|1.0|I would have given this three stars as a good offbeat, quirky movie, but the portrayal of sexuality and marriage between barely developed 12-year-olds was disturbing. I'm surprised more reviewers weren't troubled by that.
B001ANYDAO|3.0|The stories were interesting to a point. I feel a 2 page outline of the vitals might have served the purpose. But then it wouldn't be a book. While the stories help generate validity to the theories put forward, I felt they were a bit long to serve that end. I won't make this review a spoiler, so will not give details, but the pricing for the Kindle version overcomes the fluff. The book price<br />would be too much.
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|great game lots of fun and plenty to keep you busy, with cute birds and good sounds. filing this out is a pain.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I am in love with my horse! its a great app that lets you own and take care of a horse.
B00005YXZH|3.0|I bought this album because I have other Wilco tracks I like and recommender systems kept popping this one up.  I can see why they did.  It has all the elements of sound that I like in my music.  By any measure, I should like this album, but the tracks leave me flat.  They are nice but not exciting, not moving, not note worthy.  A good listen but not something I would have bought had I heard more of the content.
B00AW8UK0K|3.0|I have no doubt that fasting is generally good for one's health.<br /><br />But not everybody will lose weight following this.<br /><br />I have been losing an average of 700 g a week following my weight watchers lifestyle.<br /><br />Then I decided to combine the 5:2 with my WW.<br /><br />The first week I lost 2 kg, but then e Rey week after that I only lost 100 and 200 g.<br /><br />I guess my body just adapted and saved energy instead of losing weight.<br /><br />I am now experimenting with 1 fasting day a week, but if I see o results, I'll go back to my WW regime, which was working well.
B003FHGI9W|3.0|I gave it a 3 as it made my 10 year old son cry so there must have been something in it. I found it a bit boring.
B001E25MBK|5.0|The Godfather series is my favorite movie and this is well worth buying, and of course watching many, many times.
B0011XBLUS|5.0|Simply the best western ever filmed. The title says it all and I'm sure it's all been said already by other reviewers.
B00CL68NOG|1.0|I was bored to death with this movie, it never got any better no matter how long I watched it.  It didn't live up to my expectations.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|I wanted to see what a novel would look like from the view of a forensic scientist. I was intrigued with the initial plot and the search for the retarded woman who had killed her new born babies. The plot then left that area and expanded to another part of Canada. Insert two male companions with romantic history involving the female forensic consultant and suddenly you have a totally separate problem from the mystery at hand. Temperance Brennan of Bones are Forever and Temperance Brennan of Bones TV are two very different people. I think I like the TV version better, although they both share an unnatural ability to get themselves in life threatening situations. One would think that people this bright would not take some of these foolish chances when back-up is at hand.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|It was a good movie from start to finish, it kept me on the edge of my seat!  Happy watching!
B000FA5STS|5.0|The characters are introduced and the circumstances of the problem begin to surface. Your first reaction is a total disbelief that all of the diverse threads can be woven into a web that makes sense. I must say that I was totally in the dark as to who all the protagonists were until nearly the end. The story is complex but so well thought out that no loose ends are left hanging. I still have an admiration for people that put themselves in harm's way so often without suffering fatal consequences.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I love si fy books thus I tried this one. It is an amazing plot you look forward to finding how it ends.. unfortunately the story lasts more than 4 books. I really recommend this story and all the subsequent books.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|This book was horrible and I was really disappointed because I always like his books.  Characters were poorly depicted to create interest and involvement.  I could not finish the book as I don't like to waste time reading something that I did not find engaging.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|Works as advertised, well worth the money. Try any Nikon flash and you will enjoy using it... It just good reliable product.
B00CL6GDF2|5.0|\\"Hannibal\\" is intriguing, beautifully shot, and excellently written. The characters are complex and the storyline all absorbing. I am a huge fan of the Hannibal Lechter novels and this show is just as good if not better. Seeing Hannibal prior to incarceration is fascinating. I knew I would like the series when I heard about it but I had no idea how much. Mads Mikkelsen is Hannibal, no offense to Anthony Hopkins, whom I adore, but Mads does it so much better. This show is like nothing else on TV today, love it!
B00CDT41RY|4.0|What I've come to think of as &#34;typical Tarantino.&#34; Engaging story, good acting by an appealing cast, nods to previous directors/films, cartoonish violence. Thoroughly enjoyed it.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|thiss game is awesome. I am super happy it came out on kindle its really cool<br />AWESOME!!really really cool<br />! c o o l
B00B7ERH04|5.0|Hey this app is awesome. I didn't have a video recorder on my android until I got this cool app. It has good graphics and resolutions.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Definitely worth the money. I wish Clancy would write more. Bear & the Dragon is probably his best thought still.
B003V40SGS|2.0|I wanted to like this movie. The special effects were likable, the concept sounded exciting, passable and likable, but the characters were embarrassing to me. Those robots were so annoying! The humans were cardboard cut-outs. It's easy to believe this movie was prompted (not inspired) by the success of Star Wars. If this hadn't come out so fast after that success it still would have felt quickly contrived and not well thought-out.<br /><br />And that ending? Give me a break! As one who loves inspirational ideas I was offended, not surprised.
B006LSZECO|4.0|If you like mystery and twists, this is a good book for you.  Well written for the most part, but does struggle a bit to hold all things together towards the climactic conclusion.
B00899F0G8|5.0|love it and so happy to be able to watch all the episodes in a marathon.  next season soon, yay/
B00854DWN0|3.0|The treasure chest was ruined but the book covers were sticky and one was ripped a little. The books were good its just I didn't like how the chest was torn a lot. And the collectsbles didn't come with it either. If you want the nonripped chest and if you want the camp half-blood collectables I suggest you get the $50 one this one does not come with everything. I hoped this helped you and have you an idea what it is like.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had this  e book for quite some time but just finished the book.  It was better than I thought it would be.
B009T8XBBO|5.0|Easy enough with just the right amount of challenge so as not to strain the brain while waiting in line or just passing time.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|George R.R. Martin writes an excellent story and I can't stop reading his books.  He certainly knows how to bring out the emotions of his readers by the actions that take place with the characters he creates.
B006M4F67A|5.0|This one is well done, it is not easy to do which in my opinion is a goood thing.  Gotta love Amazon's free apps.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|I was very disappointed, which I feel badly about.  Maybe I expected too much, but it seemed as if I had seen that same plot, albeit  with different circumstances, many times before.
B005ZOBNOI|2.0|The author writes well and some would believe real.  But I would not go out of my way to read something so without hope.  Yes, these things happen all the time, but the main character is so depressing and morbid, why read it at all.  Someone with cancer reading this may well think what's the use.  I would prefer someone who at least has some semblance of hope or at least some quality of life.  The main character in this book didn't even enjoy her first time sexual encounter.  I wouldn't want a young person reading this to think there is nothing beautiful in life.  Nothing to look forward to.
B00CC1K320|1.0|I would out ZERO stars if it was allowed OMG absolute worse customer service ever experienced on Amazon. This Rearth experience is well noted NEVER AGAIN. This company made a error in shipping out the wrong item to me not one but two but I am the one to suffer.<br />This item is overly priced, all companies have adjusted their price and they are maintaining theirs. The item is flimsy and not worth the money paid. I wish I never purchased these cases.<br />Customer Service is poor amongst having a mediocre product FAILURE!!!!!!!<br /><br />So I never received this color case after ordering two of them and excited for the arrival. I received two black cases instead, what an anti climax after waiting a little while for it to shipped. Contacted the company, well that was not quite a pleasant experience.<br />The case is light weight and doesn't add too much bulk, the stand feature is not the best but does the job. I would not purchase this item again. The cost factor is high and so more other options available now.
B00136NUG6|5.0|Excellent best-hits CD. Earth, Wind and Fire are truly one of the best soul groups. Well worth the download.  love it.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|This movie is awesoooooooooome. I can't get over it. Even though it makes me cry, it makes up for it by making me laugh 90% of the time.
B004SRNH10|5.0|This worked great for my device and I think that most devices need some sort of Adobe products on them.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|Game is not working correct. To build a security tower I have to leave my kindle on and the app open.
B008KE3960|5.0|You fly aircraft and try to blow up tanks on the roads before they reach the end of the screen. It's very easy in the beginning. You earn gears that can be used to buy more powerful aircraft and maps. Time just flies as you play this game. There is an option where you can buy planes & bombs with real $.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|i havent truely figured it all out yet.<br />not as simple to use as i had hoped<br />i guess i exspectede it to be  easy
B006M4F67A|5.0|Great game, I can't stop playing it! I times you & then rates you with stars. This game is very addictive.
B00992CF6W|5.0|survivalcraft is better but this game ... i honestly cant consider it minecraft it dosent even have the same capabilitys as xbox edition so people heres my opinon i have survival craft and mcpd mcpd=good multiplayer i agree on that
B005PK57IK|5.0|As riveting as the first two seasons! I had seen a couple live but missed most of them. This helped with the continuity of the story for me.  The last episode was a cliffhanger!
1932100660|5.0|NOTHING SHORT THAN STUNNING, WELL EXPLAINED, SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH THAT BACKS UP HE'S INFORMATION OVER AND OVER AGAIN. A MUST READ FOR ALL!!!
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|excellent, finally something different and new, loved it. it is really nice to see actors doing multiple roles, it also had a good pace.
B0098XZHSU|5.0|Truly love this app. Listen to alot of music and it definately lets me listen to music i enjoy. If  your looking to discover classic  oldies, rock, r&b to trance and alternative . This is the app for you.
B00AKKTDJY|1.0|Ok this should be labeled as Diner Dash Distrust! 99&cent; for each additional restaurant puts your tally at almost 8$! I don't think so,this company has alreadyripped off thothousands of customers by refusing to fix their games to run on newer phones and instead email you a link to buy a more expensive version. Uninstall and never install from this company again.
B00CIU3IVS|1.0|I want the actual music from the movie. The mesh between now and then. The brilliance that was the music of The Great Gatsby. This album is nothing but a list of songs that I've heard in their original format way too many times for a few (Jay Z). Epic fail.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I hated all the sex and the four letter word<br />that they said all time.<br />I didn't like anything about the book.<br />The author must be a sadist.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I enjoyed Suzanne series of all three books. Very descriptive. about war, destruction and survival to continue to exist as the human race.
B009NY43NY|2.0|The other books made me crave the next page with the exception of one book.  This one did not come nearly as easy.  Oh well. Guess  you can't win them all but I did expect more from Ms.  Harris' last crack at Sookie.

B00CDFWJIG|5.0|It has great bewitching scenes in it and great special effects. Each time you watch it you pick up more interesting concepts.
055358202X|3.0|I know a lot of people consider this the worst in the series, but after the insane events of [[ASIN:B000FBFN1U A Storm of Swords: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Three]], how could the next entry in George R.R. Martin's series not be slightly disappointing? Personally, I thought this would be a slog to get through, focusing on the events in King's Landing and the less-exciting characters of the series (the Lannisters, Sam Tarly, the Ironborn), but instead I found it to be an excellent piece of world-building, with Martin introducing more factions into the mix and digging into the history of Westeros. In addition, the long arc that seems to point toward Jaime Lannister's redemption is one of the strongest points in the book, and Arya's induction into the Faceless Men is intriguing, even though it is difficult to imagine how her plotline will intersect the others later in the series.<br /><br />The two new factions that are most interesting, mostly because the squabbling nobles fail to see either as a threat, are the Iron Bank of Braavos and the militant church. The increasing threats of the bank coming to collect its due from the crown is present throughout the book, and the establishment of an army by the church is approved by Cersei (who spends this book scheming and failing to rule), and no one seems to realize that these two groups will completely undermine the ruling powers.<br /><br />Jaime Lannister continues to get more interesting. He's come a long way from being the immoral knight of the first book, and I'm excited to see what else happens to him as the series continues. His path in this novel is to quell the last bits of revolution in the Riverlands, and Martin uses this to give us further insight into Jaime's motivations while pushing him further away from his sister. Jaime's former companion/captor, Brienne, also gets several chapters in this book, although she spends most of the time chasing false leads, never seeming to get closer to finding the Stark girls. The event that ends her story in this book is pretty amazing, though.<br /><br />The events in Dorne are a little muddled, but point toward developments that I hope will matter in the last three books. Other plotlines, like the Ironborn's kingsmoot and Sam's journey, are just not that interesting. While we do get to see how another group chooses their ruler, it's difficult to care about any of the Ironborn all that much. They don't really move past what you already thought they were. Sam spends much of the book stuck between ports, which makes it seem like Martin is simply marking time until he can advance this plot. He does have a brief run-in with Arya, however, which continues Sam's streak of meeting supposedly-dead Starks.<br /><br />Is this the weakest book in the series? Probably, but that does not mean it's terrible. It's the moment where the series catches its breath before the last push, the author's chance to set up the pieces for the conflicts that will play out over the last third of the series, and in that, it's successful.ls.

B002VRZEYM|4.0|I recommend to watch this movie. It reveals many things about the food industry that many of us ignore and have been doing it for a long time. It tells you realize about how we all could contribute and change patterns from society that are being negative and destructive to the environment and our own health.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best building game for kindle! Build any thing you can imagine. It has multiplayer and single player.Creative and survival mode. You can change the dificulty setting.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|At last a show with some depth and intriguing evolution of main characters. Both leads bring charm and wisdom to the plots and keep you invested in their journey together.  It is refreshing and kept me looking forward to the next episode knowing I would continue to witness some excellent acting and direction! A+++ for sure.
B005EWDA9M|5.0|Murakami really knows how to tell a good storey.<br />His work is detailed - but doesn't get bogged down.<br />He has some very original storey lines.
B005S9EK5Y|1.0|I bought this for my daughter and was disturbed that a PG-13 rated movie could have this much sex in it.  It really should be R rated.
B005HEPIDS|5.0|This was the best show of the franchise.  I hated to see it go and would even like to see the crew and ship in new adventures in movie form.  Doubt it will happen...just sayin.

B005PK57NU|5.0|Can't wait for it to become a prime show.  I'm now watching Army Wives and there are 6 prime seasons but then the 7th is also pay per episode.
B00AKEMHCA|4.0|Fits awsome but you need to buy sooo many things with actual money, other than that, the game is great!
B007ZBWJXI|4.0|Overall I liked the album, although the material may not have been as strong as their previous album it was still enjoyable. John Wetton sounds as great as ever, and the band sounds as good as they did 30 years ago. Unfortunely this the last Asia album with Steve Howe, who retired after this album was released. if you enjoy Asia music you will enjoy this one. Came with a DVD so that was a nice bonus.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is my favorite game on my kindle. I play this every night before I go to sleep. This is the best game I've ever played. I wish itbeorked on my ipod touch though. Please help me with that please, please,please!
B001BKVWYG|5.0|lost for 40 years selling a very few in the U. S. a time machine of what is happin' today...
B004SRPXWQ|2.0|The free version doesn't do much! It is rather boring. Deleted it from my phone because I didn't like it.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|lost for over 40 years selling only a very few copies in the U. S. to be overlooked for others to enjoy
B007GCY8FS|4.0|This one kept me second guessing myself. Reacher is larger than life and always a step ahead. I would recommend this book to any one who has a love/hate relationship with action thrillers.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game has lots of fun and neat PUZZLES unlike other games there are just PUZZLES not hidden objects which I enjoyed because of its uniqueness. I can't wait for the next game since the ending said to look forward to more rooms. I loved the mechanical imaging as well as the way the 3d and pivoting and zooming. It had similar movement as a Prezi presentation. Well worth the money someone said on a different review that it wasn't long enough they must have hit the hint button often I felt that the PUZZLES were challenging and it took several hours to play.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I don't reread books much, but this is so good I just can't resist visiting the story over and over again. May be the best book I've ever read.
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|There are to many ads during the game.  Could have paid to have the ads removed but the game was free...go figure
B000SEH80I|2.0|I wish I had known the majority of the book was recounting past patients stories. I really didn't learn anything more than I already knew. This book is basically a collection of excerpts from counseling appointments.
B00BJ9VBLI|3.0|It asks you to buy too soon. Should b able to reach more levels before they do that. This is the only reason I can't give it a 5.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Really enjoyed this one. Can't wait until the next game!<br />Very unique and curious.<br />Saving to my favorites...<br />Loved the graphics too.
B009KWU6Q2|5.0|Just as good as the 1st time I saw it as a child... So many memories, still a classic flick.
B006X5L6VS|2.0|GPS on kindle HD is a bit off even with a great wifi signal. Manual mode is ok. On screen buttons are hard to press. In app purchase for info pack, but I'm not likely to try that considering how underwhelmed I am with this app. Ok for basic info but I will likely dump this for a better app.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is so cool. I bout it like 10min ago and it Is a cool game u need toget it
B00571F26Y|4.0|Unfortunately--LOTS of repetition. I DO nonetheless recommend it highly! Just know it is dry in some area, lotsa medical jargon.
B008MM9630|1.0|Boring ,it's for a child really. The music is annoying and to buy things by points is very expensive.Don't bother
B009NY43NY|4.0|I have read all the hype about the ending to this story. Well I for one think the ending is very real. It wasn't  my favorite Sookie book but I enjoyed it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My husband and I fight over who gets the iPad so we can play. This game is so addictive we both ove it!
B00BMEF8UA|5.0|The new Iced Earth line up shows they mean business with this release.  Flawless version of When The Night Falls, Ten Thousand Strong, Boiling Point just to name a few.  Great set list and very well proformed.  Very happy with purchase.  \m/\m/
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Good short cut, to many apps, wish u didn't have to have a different app for different things that u look up.
B00BFPX132|5.0|Sodom proves once again why they are a ruler in the thrash metal universe.  Insane riffs, flawless vocals, amazing songs and just a solid headbanging release.  Sodom never dissapoints.  \m/\m/
B002RI9MWA|3.0|&#34;The Reluctant Fundamentalist&#34; is very well written and cleverly constructed.  Moshin Hamid creastes a fascinating tableau from which his reader is challenged to see the western world through the eyes of a disillusioned outsider. For the ambitious young Pakistani who sails through Princeton and lands a lucrative job on Wall Street, assimilation in the inner workings of western capitalist society seems to promise everything. Or does it? For very soon the aptly named Changez sees from individuals from even the most privileged echelons of US society can become lost and alienated.  After the world changing events of September 2001, he begins to rebuild his identity from the outside in, beginning by resuming his national dress and then growing his beard before returning to his homeland.  But how much has he really changed? He remains the charming and friendly narrator, gently teasing, teaching and reassuring his uncertain foreign guest. Perhaps Hamid's real point is that we are not really all that different after all.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I chose the product because I wanted to protect my new Kindle Fire.  I also chose the one I did due to price, it was sold as used.  I was very pleased at the condition, it looked new.  I would recommend this product to anyone interested.
B0082Z447U|5.0|First of all, this is a free Kindle book so why wouldn't you try it.  But beyond the free bit, this novel is worth every penny you didn't pay for it.  It is a wonderful thriller written in beautiful prose with suspense and unrequited love and all of those things that make you wish you lived in the old England (apart from the parts where people catch their deaths from merely standing outside in the rain for 20 minutes).  This is a highly recommended novel.  Please please please read it.
B00499QUK2|5.0|I cannot recommend this series enough. It approaches Doyle's stories with a modern twist, and writing, casting, setting, and acting are all superb. The second episode feels a little cliche, but the others are excellent.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|It was not all bad.  Perhaps I expected more because the story came from the W brothers and/or because Hanks was a lead.  Why use such complex time shifts to convey such simple ideas?  It is always hard for actors to create dialects of English that do not exist today.  At times, I found myself wondering why the movie did not use subtitles.  This was another example of needless complexity and it was not done in a believable manner. If you can imagine Hanks rapping then you can imagine him speaking the future Bayou-Jamaican jive talk used in this film.  That scene from Airplane with subtitles comes to mind but there was no comedy in this movie.  Comedy apparently does not exist in the future (or the past as portrayed in this film). Hopefully, when this film is reincarnated, it will become a better film.
B004GJXQ20|4.0|Great story well told. Epic. Read it after viewing the series because I'd missed a couple of episodes and it rounded out a lot of questions and confusions I had. Fabulous.
B00BKBCF38|5.0|I love this album. I'm in my thirties, so I don't know what similarities this may have to 70's rock. I'm sure there are some influences there. But from someone of my age group, I hear bits and pieces of the Misfits (new and old), Queens of the Stone Age and Pat Benatar... then mix in a blender with all the Catholic masses I ever sat through. Love it. Zombie Queen, Monstrance Clock and Jigolo are some of my favorites.
B00CAUH7UE|4.0|Unlike most guides and do yourself books, give and take has adopted a practical and workable approach to the subject.  One can almost relate it to real life experiences.  Highly recommended
B001UV4XIS|5.0|loved all the movies.  this one is no exception.  its a fun evening at home when I watch all the harry potter movies.
B006LSZECO|2.0|This story is definitely  for females. The plot was interesting, but the ending was a disappointing and left me flat
B000JMKQX0|5.0|After reading a positive review of Brad Pitt's upcoming movie and the troubles they've had making it, it seemed like a good idea to read the book first.  Am glad I did.  It was a fascinating treatise on the differences in world cultures and in human beings. There was plenty of violence and gore, but the &#34;zombies&#34; were incidental and not the principle focus as much as the issue of how to rid the world of them.  Less sci-fi than one would think.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|Had a story line, great actors. I didn't know it was a true story till the end. Good story about going for your dreams!!
B002RKXO6S|4.0|\\"The Circle\\" is a super Bon Jovi record.  They're not a band that is well served by reinventing the wheel, they have their own groove and they're at their best when they fig into that groove.  \\"The Circle\\" is a perfect example of that.  It just feels right.  There's a nice collection of guitar-driven pop rock songs that are best served by being turned up loudly and sung along with.<br /><br />From the opening crunch of \\"We Weren't Born To Follow,\\" \\"The Circle\\" didn't produce a lot of major chart hits but it created a group of songs that fans should embrace.  \\"Superman Tonight\\" is a schmaltzy mid tempo ballad that Jon excels at, \\"Thorn In My Side\\" is a great rock song with one of Jon's better stinging lyrics.  There's not a real clunker on the record, even if Jon's commentary in \\"Bullet\\" feels out of place.<br /><br />My favorite song is easily \\"Love's the Only Rule,\\" a big-hearted arena shaker that begs to be replayed.  \\"Happy Now\\" and \\"When We Were Beautiful\\" follow closely behind.  This is a big band doing a stadium-sized record.  It's well worth a listen.
B008ODZNLG|5.0|A friend recommended this documentary to me, and I didn't have super high expectations. But I found myself completely sucked into the story. It epitomizes the saying that if you're going to do something, do it well.
B00B4VXQC8|1.0|This is easily my least favorite Bon Jovi record.  And I'm a fan.  A big fan.  I'm not mad that this record isn't the second coming of &quot;New Jersey&quot; or that it doesn't sound the same as the band did in the 90's.  I'm mad because it just isn't a good record, not even close to &quot;The Circle&quot; that was their last release - and a strong one, it was.<br /><br />I think my biggest gripe is that this record sounds like everyone except Bon Jovi.  There's no personality to it, Richie's guitar work is nowhere to be found (and we know based on his solo record released a few months previous that he can still play.)  But the guitar riff in &quot;What About Now&quot; whiffs of The Killers, the entire melody of the verses of &quot;Beautiful World&quot; sounds like a Matchbox Twenty song, &quot;Amen&quot; feels like a poor man's &quot;Halleluiah,&quot; &quot;What's Left of Me&quot; almost slides into becoming an old Rod Stewart song.  None of it sounds like Bon Jovi.  The lyrics are campy and cliched, seemingly aimed to be generic enough to be used in commercials for whatever organizations want to remind people to feel good with some banal sentiment.<br /><br />It's not a total loss - &quot;That's What the Water Made Me&quot; is a fun enough rock song; &quot;Thick As Thieves&quot; is a good second tier ballad.  But there's nothing to raise your pulse, nothing that I can't wait to hear live.  But there are no classic Bon Jovi songs on here.  There are barely a couple good ones.
B00AFOS6P2|3.0|I was really rather disappointed in this CD. There were one or two good songs, and I usually love everything Nick does but this seemed lackluster compared to his other CD's. This may be one of those that grows on you the more you listen to it.
B00932A4XE|5.0|This movie was wonderful. It was not only funny and sweet, but it showed all the different sides of pregnancy and the situations that pregnancies arise from. I would definitely recommend this movie to someone.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|Great to have this software on android smartphone, you can save you video once in different resolutions and then enjoy them later without internet connectivity.Thanks!
B0095P31L6|1.0|Terrible movie! Not a good kids movie. Crude humor and language for a kids cartoon movie.  Not what I expected.
0822203073|3.0|It wasn't the ISBN that I had expected but since there wasn't an image of the book, I couldn't tell.<br />Delivery was within the expected time period.
B008B1BL4E|2.0|I could only read about 10% of the book. It is a numbing collection of details about the lead up to WW1.  I will rarely set a history book down but had to on this one. I read Clark's book on Prussia and loved it.
0440243688|4.0|Same as Reacher Rules love the character and the right vs. wrong since that you get from every novel that lee child writes.
B004X2M3N8|5.0|I'm an old fan of Dr. Who from my College days. Even attended a Who convention once way back in the 80's. I just recently discovered it came back and proceeded to watch from season 1 onward daily after work. I have just finished watching season 6. This comeback of Dr. Who did not disappoint. It was packed with mystery, intrigue human drama and excitement.  I can't wait until season 7 is available on netflix and Amazon streaming for free. I don't get BBC America on my basic cable so Netflix and Amazon are my only avenue to watching it.<br /><br />I'm anxious for the 50th anniversary season to start. So excited. Both my 12 year old and 15 year old kids are now watching it with me. Dr. Who Transcends generations and is timeless (pun intended).
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This is a highly recommended chic flick.  Great music, great cast, and great storyline. This movie is great for all ages.
0756686970|5.0|Another great addition to my five year old sons collection.... The Lego book series always provide hours of amusement as the pages fill with all of the appropriate stickers!
1476733953|5.0|Dredged up from our collective post-apocalyptic nightmare but refreshingly written. The author keeps the plot moving and provides us with such visceral writing that you will see the steps as his characters move in their vertical world. A dark book with a spark of light and ultimately showing faith in our humanity after the ultimate inhumanity has happened.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Whole family LOVES Hannibal. Excellent acting & writing, such interesting characters and relationships. Mads Mikkelsen is freaking fantastic. WE ARE ADDICTED!!!!!
B009NY43NY|5.0|Such a great series it's a shame for it to end. I could keep enjoying Sookie's adventures for years to come.
B003XE3G0Q|5.0|Love these shoes! I wear them on photo shoots when I might be in the mud or wet. I went to the croc store and bought the decorative charms for them and now they are cuter. This price is half of what they get in the stores for them and they are worth every penny. They are a little shorter than a true size 9 though so if you're on the fence about a 9 or 9 1/2, go bigger.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|fun to play. once you start to play you can not stop playing. so look forward to hours of fun.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|The movie also came with a code for this app so I can watch it on my phone, which is pretty damn cool!
B000FC2L1E|4.0|Beware.  The first of the series is free, but hooks you.  Diana Gabaldon does an excellent job of writing historical stories and makes it hard to not want the next book.
B005VPRFSY|5.0|This too, was a great toy that my grandson, 8 years old, requested for Christmas.  He loves it still and plays with it often.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I was hesitant to read this book, because of the subject matter; however, it was well written and the story line over the whole series was very sweet.  The age of the parties was the biggest leap for me, however.
B006VA57CY|5.0|I love this series.  Excellent.  I belong to Netfix and they only have the first Season available.  At first I was not going to pay the money to download season 2 & 3 but since watching season 1 I decided to spend the money to see season 2 & 3 as I am enthrall with the life of this family.  Characters as so well developed.  We see the flaws and good charateristics of each...like real life!!  Very entertaining and I am looing forward each night to watching the rest of it all.  I will try to DVR the one next this coming fall.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I was hesitant to read this book, because of the subject matter; however, it was well written and the story line over the whole series was very sweet.  The age of the parties was the biggest leap for me, however.

076115728X|5.0|Finally a children's book that sees art  from a prospective that is real, art has no mistakes. Children can be so critical of themselves, and at a time when they should just be free they often over analyze. This book is a must read for everyone, at any age.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I was hesitant to read this book, because of the subject matter; however, it was well written and the story line over the whole series was very sweet.  The age of the parties was the biggest leap for me, however.

B0000714BP|5.0|It had 1 or 2 places where DVD stopped, but after I cleaned it ,it was fine. It was just as funny as I remembered!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Just as enjoyable to read, as it is to watch Tina perform on tv and movies. Highly recommend for light reading and fun.

B00A7OIXW6|4.0|Very cute movie. Disney never puts out a bad movie, and even though I'm an adult we love to watch them.
B003G4W49C|5.0|The story was captivating. I found it hard to remember the main character was so young, I kept relating the age back to a teenager. I also enjoyed the Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde view points.
B007B5EDEG|4.0|I have found it a easy read and the author gets you involved right from the start. The story has every emotion that I like in a book that makes it hard for me to put down once I start to read, it has action, suspense, horror, romance, drama. The book takes you on an adventure that you would not have dreamed of. It puts you in the situations of the characters and makes you think that, no way would have liked to be around in that time that the author is writing about. It is very compelling and intriguing and hard for me to put down.
B000002H70|5.0|Stop reading reviews of this album.  Disintegration is so meaningful and important.  Please stop reading these amateur reviews and go experience the album for yourself.  Thank you Robert Smith for being so humble and creative and genesis
B005LJITS0|5.0|Since Spider-man, Green Lantern is my Sons favorite. I myself enjoyed the move very well. We hope to see another one, Green Lantern Two very soon.
B005KAH7QU|5.0|Action all through movie. This girl was trained well and was smart. Dad did a goodbjon in training her for survival.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Chose from over 40 different sounds to create a personalized melody that fits your mood. Plus, you can control how long it plays with a timer, the volume of each individual sound, and than save your favorite melodies.
1451695195|5.0|What a book!!  If you are interested in the afterlife like i am this is the book for you!  The reason I think I truly enjoyed this book is because even though it is written by a Neurosurgeon, he writes in ways you can truly understand and comprehend!  Also, since he is an expert with all knowledge of the brain, it made it especially real and very interesting to me.  He describes everything in vivid detail and you truly feel you are on the same journey with him.  Get this book if you truly want to know what happens on the other more meaningful side!
B003DBOS7Y|5.0|This is a wonderful movie. The story line is moving and the cinematography is spectacular.<br />it took me awhile to figure out how to rent the movie on my computer and then watch it on my TV.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|This was a good book! I liked that it was written as a set of interviews with survivors. It kept my attention and I kept thinking that if the zombie apocalypse were to be real this would be how it would play out. Nothing in the book was too far fetched and it all made sense. I just wish the author stated how it started. What actually made the dead rise?
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Exciting to the end, the storm captured the mood and intensity.  I would like to revisit more of Follett's books after this one.  I liked the historical context and characters.
B004JMSIRC|5.0|The original. The entry to the Iron Man Franchise is very well made. Robert Downey Jr. is the perfect fit for Tony Stark. This movie is very well planned and all actors did an excellent job portraying the characters and bringing them to life. It will always be one of my all time favorite movies ever made.
B00BR476TG|2.0|I wondered if I would like the movie so I watched most of the preview. I was tempted to stop the video preview because it was too nightmarish. I don't like to see animals get hurt. I'm sure they didn't but it was horrible for me...so I don't want to see the movie.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|Chris Evans does a good job replicating Captain America. I thought the movie had it's slow moments but, the action sequences were very well made. Overall a good movie.
193700788X|1.0|I was all ready to sit down and write a long review explaining the many ways this book let me down, but I looked over the three most helpful reviews and saw many others have already spoken clearly as to exactly what I was thinking.  I am just sad, CH could have created a marvelous ending to this series, but it was not to be.  I am reminded of one of my favorite movie lines, \\"...my hypocrisy only goes so far...\\"  Apparently CH's goes a looong way.  Poor Sookie, struggling through all those books for acceptance and a fair shake for every type of creature, goes out quiet as a mouse and a bigot to boot.
B006WXHJNU|5.0|This movie was very entertaining from start to finish. Edward Norton does Dr. Bruce Banner justice. It does not follow the origin of the actual comic book story line but nevertheless, it is still a good movie.
B006M4F67A|3.0|Arrangements of tiles are challenging and good.  Music makes is so monotonous. Wish I could change the tile design easily.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|I don't know why this movie didn't get a ton of favorable reviews. I thought the cinamatography was excellent. The movie sets that were created were awesome. The action sequences were nicely done. I actually enjoyed this movie more than The Incredible Hulk and Captain America.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I love this book and was addicted to it. It was totally different than the movie in the good way. L. Frank Baum did a great job! I will definitely be buying other books in the series.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|Robert Downey Jr. is by far the absolute best choice for this character. I can't imagine anyone else playing Tony Stark. The movie is excellently made. The special effects are second to none. I just hope they don't do to Iron Man what they did to Spiderman by replacing the actor that best replicates the character. That would be a shame to the Iron Man franchise.
B008JFLWLE|4.0|I use it on the job, at college, with the grandkids and anything else as needed. Good tool to have in the time of need to make the job easy.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Nick Fury and of course Iron Man. Excellent special effects, great story line and very well planned and excecuted movie. The only downfall if there could be one found is, they need to keep one Dr. Bruce Banner. Quit changing the actor who portrays him. I still think that the best actor that played The Hulk was Edward Norton. (my personal opinion of course) Otherwise, an excellent movie.
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|The grandkids like the series and the challenge to top angry bird. It keeps them motivated and challenging to each other
B000255LIY|5.0|I thought I would never see a release of this movie that I would like as much as the version where Katherine Hepburn played Eleanor. This one is only slightly different. Although it will never challenge the Hepburn original, it stands on its own....Seraphim Harper
B002C949AE|5.0|Maybe the most brutal experience a young female child could ever go through (if they survive at all). Have no idea how Waris Dirie lived through the mutilation, left home at 12 rather than being married off to an old man and built a life for herself in a new country without the help of her family or friends. I know I could never have lived through it. A very enlightening book that I think every woman should read!
0307887960|5.0|This book was one of my very favorites since it used unconditional dieting methods. It keep my attention the whole time.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|a great game of logic. Beginnings to ends and never the paths shall meet. Use the whole board, whether it be 5x5 up to 9x9. Very well done, beautiful colors, easy to understand, great for all ages. Never get tired of the challenge.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Of all the Majhong games I've tried this is my favorite.  I like that you can change your mind and put tiles back in place and see if you can make different selections to improve the outcome.  You can do that anytime in the game.  And so many different setups also!  A great game app!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A fabulous read, highly recommend, so glad I read, could not  wait till I could pick the book up and continue to read.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|NCIS continues to provide great entertainment from a strong cast. This season again provided an opportunity for each member of the cast to shine.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This is a great game. I would give it 5 stars but it does freeze sometimes and the tournaments are pretty lop-sided and go way to quick.
0307472590|5.0|recomiendo mil veces este libro, es una historia fascinante, la edicion es perfecta, las paginas, el tamaño de las letras y todo, perfecto. gracias.
B00COGY2P2|5.0|Great movie, lots of action and car chase scenes. Tom Cruise played a great prt, however think a actor more suited to Jack Reachers size would have been better.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This app lets you get animals.I get a lot of animal zoo games,but they never let you do that.I haven't gotten to the dinosaur part yet,but I'm sure it will be really cool.Also,it has very good graphics.Please get this game!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app it addictive but mojang please come out with an update so there will be caves and that kind of stuff please!!!!
B00876GO36|1.0|Bought this movie despite the bad reviews. It was really bad... Still love Seagal movies, though. I say don't buy this. If it is free on prime or Netflix-it is fine...
B004X6PRO6|5.0|This book is harrowing to read, due to the total cruelty of the state to its citizens, and of most citizens to one another. But it also leaves you to ponder whether you would dare to be otherwise in such a country.<br />The author tackles the huge problem of human behavior in such a land, and is mostly convincing in his findings.
B00633W614|5.0|As usual Jeffrey Archer has spun such a tale that I have not been able to put down this saga.  I can't wait to get to the next book!
6302468027|5.0|This movie makes you laught & cry, I promiss if you watch it u will luv it as I do.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I'm pretty surprised how fun this app is. I thought it would be geared towards little girls with horse obsessions but its actually quite entertaining. Not so hard an older child couldn't understand but not so juvenal that I'm getting bored. Lots of goals to work towards and mini tasks to complete. Training, competing,  feeding, tack upgrades and new horses to buy... everything seems to be obtainable with patience although in app purchases are available also.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|This was as good or better than the 1st season, can't wait for Season 3 to become available. I Loved it.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I really enjoy this app. It is very dependable and I like being able to check my battery status quickly. I would highly recommend adding to your Kindle.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Really fun game cool characters and vehicles. Ifs fun to kill the birds and run over things crabs,huts and trees
B0094K1MH2|4.0|Not necessarily for younger viewers in the respects to content, but it is an entertaining story. The animation is realty well done!
0547884591|5.0|I love this book. It was not expensive, and so far I have yet to open it to a page that doesn't contain interesting information and excellent formatting. And since there are 650+ pages in the book, I think I'm probably getting a pretty good return on investment. I would even say this book is worth the cost just for the section \\"The Bite-Size World: 193 Recipes, 193 Countries.\\" And the best part is this section is only 5 pages long! Tim knows how to pack it in.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who cooks anything or wants to learn how to learn things better and faster. It is a downright bargain for what you receive.
B002CNOA6S|5.0|If you have never watched this movie, it is one that shall move you emotionally. One that is destined to be an all time classic.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|Pretty good though. Don't anticipate renting again. May watch if no alternative open. Effects better than original. Miss Sharon Stone.
159562015X|5.0|An interesting concept, to think of our strengths and focus on them rather than trying to shore up our weaknesses and make them better.  I hope that you'll take the time to check out the book.<br /><br />Be sure to buy a NEW copy so that you can take the Strength finder survey at the end of it<br /><br />Enjoy,....its only about 30 pages and then the rest is reference for you to read through after the quiz.
B00CDT41RY|3.0|Story was OK. Glad I chose to rent instead of buy. I will not be able to comment further as i did not view this on surround system. Do not anticipate watching again soon.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|The film told a complete story. The production including the filming location, costunes,and soundtrack were well planned. Overall I found this movie to be quite entertaining.
B005HS00V4|3.0|This BluRay has some truly powerful moments to it. The Book of Love and Biko stand out among them! The conclusion to Biko alone is worth the watch.  There are other powerful arrangements and performances by the orchestra and Peter throughout. Intruder sets a good pace and I can't say it disappoints musically from there on, but both the Female vocalists and the the 3D video edits are disappointing. The video itself is often choppy and distracting -- overreaching with it's attempts to portray emotion and story.  A simpler portrayal of the musicians in action would create a far greater connection. I found that either putting the Video to Black and White are turning off the TV all together and just listening it through the DTS-Master Audio was a better substitute for the distracting lack of identity from the video. The female vocalists, while not poor by any means, often feel forced and nervous. The Book of Love has a nice female counterpoint, but I find it hard to think of another song that I felt any real connection to the female vocals.<br /><br />And I agree with many who've criticized the pacing of the overall show. Each song standalone is far more enjoyable than trying to sit through the setlist as a whole. It's water under the bridge now, but the orchestra alongside of a more typical band could have assisted with this pacing issue. See Elbow's Seldom Seen Kid Live at Abbey Road for an example of how this is done right.<br /><br />In short, good...but could have been so much better.
B004GYY714|5.0|This has all the stations and it has no problems- at least for me. You need to get this app. RIGHT NOW!!<br /><br />  XD
B00AAX68HG|4.0|Almost as fun as cut the rope with om non and his friends.  I am enjoying the fun while waiting for cut the rope updates.  You can too.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This game is freaking pimp but it takes up A LOT of space, like if you want to download something else, you can't.  But still, the game is worth it. It is so much fun.
B002RV01QI|5.0|Haunting & vibrant music - I enjoy her use of multiple, echoing sound tracks for each song & the variety in types of musc
B000JMKRKC|5.0|I really enjoyed this novel.  While the story was not a happy one, it did redempt itself with a good story line, plot and interesting twists and turns.  It was a well thought out and organized story, important facts clue to the story being released in their own good time.  It was a relief to be really engrossed in this story, and wanting to read it, instead of wondering how many more pages do I have to read until I am done!!  All the characters were interesting and while some were rather...hmm bizarre and frightening...you also found good and kind people that saved all of them as the story revealed.  Enjoy!
B0043ZDU1E|5.0|I Have several of her albums.  Loved her music since  seeing her on PBS years ago She has an unusual voice
B009PK9SB8|5.0|it Is very clear and easy to operate<br />I can  watch the effect of filming anyingtime,I like it very much
0060989157|5.0|As a young fan it was great insight into the life of the band. Getting to know each member in depth in a book I just couldn't put down!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|We didn't start watching until the 3rd season had ended.  Oddly we could watch season 1 & 2 On Demand.  However season 3 wasn't available there or anywhere else.  Thus we just bought it.  It was worth every penny.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|This was an awesome book of Greg\\"s family problems for short ups and downs and of how his family issues are different.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|This is a fun show to watch.  The writing is excellent, as are the actors.  Holmes(Jonny Lee Miller), in particular, is just riveting.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|This season brought many changes and closed some open issues. This season really helped set the table for Season 5 and the growth of its main character.<br /><br />I'm sure we'll be watching this whole season again while waiting for Season 6 to start.
B00296A4F4|4.0|Glee is just a fun show. You can always count on some good music and there were several guest stars that added to the music and fun of the show. Sure, it is a bit silly, but it is entertaining.
B009GI8J1O|2.0|I really liked the concept of people being connected across time. I think the concept was a great idea but the individual stories were so boring. Just when it was about to get interesting, the book changed to another character's story.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I enjoyed this book , towards the end it did drag on a bit, but overall  Iit is a good read.
B0011UBDTK|1.0|I cannot play this on my dvd player in the Netherlands.  Why don't you say it is only for U.S. viewing? Not happy at all
B000PDYVVG|5.0|Everybody should read this book. If, what you experience during reading didn't change your outlook on life - nothing will. Just read it not only with your eyes but with your whole being. Just like you should laugh \\"with your liver\\", you should read this book not only with your eyes. And guess what - you'll be a better person at the end. Just open yourself to words and stories in that book, take the journey with Liz and just feel life with your whole self. It's exquisite experience. Just like reading this book is exquisite experience. Enjoy and feel it and live it through Liz' experience that she so wonderfully describes. You'll love every word, every page, every chapter. Whole book is like water for thirsty person. Like banquet for starving. Like the most important prayer even for person that never believed in anything. Take this journey and you might, just might find what's important in your life or what is missing. Just in case someone does NOT get it - THIS IS THE BOOK TO READ.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Great overall book. this is the first fitness book i've read that didn't feel like an advertisement for one product or another. I had been lifting 5 days a week for a few months before reading this and after incorporating these points into my workouts and diet i saw better results in size, strength and appearance in 3 weeks than in the previous 3 months. Best of all i'm not spending most of my check on supplements any more. Definitely worth the read if you are weight training.
B00318CV28|1.0|When I went to play the movie I received an error regarding the PAL. The error explained the movie could not play because of an &#34;invalid region.&#34;.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|Although this movie is good as far as it goes, the story has been cut down to fit into a typical 2 hour movie theater time slot. And unfortunately, the story was butchered to do it. The part of George Wickham was almost entirely cut out of this version. He is one of the original central characters not only for the famous elopement but also because he fools Lizzy as to his true character so completely and helps to form her prejudice against Mr. Darcey. We see Wickham maker a couple of brief appearances in this movie and that's it: very disappointing. Go see the BBC version if you want a better version of the story. See this one if you want the Hollywood version!
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Although there are &#34;hollywood&#34; moments, for the most part The Good Wife is absorbing, entertaining and involves the viewer. It is very well acted.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I have always wanted to buy this game because many people talked about it and said it was cool, but when my mom bought it for me and I started playing it I saw  that the world space was limited, unlike survival craft who is a way cooler game than this game. It also doesn't have as much things as survival craft. I would never recommend this game to anyone, not even to the devil. But I would totally recommend survival craft, which is a way better game than this &quot;cool&quot; game.
B003TJR2HS|1.0|Didn't really work at all - overall quite disappointing - may have been a faulty unit...<br />Not worth going through the hassle of returning
B000FA675C|5.0|Can't get enough of Dan Brown's novels....patiently awaiting his newest Inferno!  This is the one that started the series....very mind provoking!
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|NKOTB has done it once again with 10, and it's the perfect title for it, because it is definitely a 10.  Absolutely terrific album!
B00821OX98|4.0|Series does a good job at pleasing every type of viewer. Alien scum, human scum, parental love, unrequited love, hidden love, pain, anger, and fairly realistic. Aliens don't seem to be too advanced to be able to accomplish interstellar travel. All the various plot twists and cliffhangers are good at making you want to watch next episode. I'm halfway through season 2 and show quality is still high.
B003QS9WIE|5.0|Great movie! I love movies that make you think, and this one did not fail to do so. Great ending.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Well drawn characters that you quickly come to care about, in plots that are neither predictable or time worn. Why this never got the ratings necessary to make a second season a reality, I will never know.
B000R4SMCW|5.0|If you like to be on the edge of your seat, this movie will not disappoint!<br /><br />One of my favorite all time movies.  Great movie by great actors with a lot of unexpected twists.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|I love Suspense and Mysteries and this Movie was very very good.  I wish they had a Series with Matthew in the lead!!
0439023513|4.0|I read it , enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone. The books came in a timely manner and in very good condition.Very pleased.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Hi this is scary Monsters and nice to build a million in this country is a potion the first half
0439023491|4.0|good book
B004EPYZSU|5.0|I avoided this film when it came out because it sounded silly.  Finally watched it and it's anything but silly. It is, in fact, a straightforward, classic Hollywood western.  It's a film that takes time getting where it's going.  It relies on characterization, and simple moral messages.  It has a basic plot structure.  The motivations of the good guys and bad guys are easy to understand, and lead to a logical climax.<br /><br />If you go in expecting action-packed fare, you will likely find it slow.  If you have a longer attention span, and enjoy genre-bending material (like Firefly, for ex).. you may be pleasantly surprised by how rich and charming this film is.  That was where the film exceeded my expectations.  I liked the cast, I cared about what was going on, and was struck by how perfectly the tone of the film was maintained.  It was never too serious, but never too light.  Just right.<br /><br />This is probably my favorite performance by Harrison Ford in years, and Daniel Craig is perfect as the man with no name. Clancy Brown shines as the preacher.<br /><br />Favorite scene:  the firepit scene at the Indian camp.<br /><br />Really enjoyed it.  Recommended.
0439023483|4.0|good book
0810970686|5.0|My 7 year old grandson loved this book. He loves the whole series. Is reading all  of them. Thank you.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I rarely give a book five stars....Tolkien, Lewis and Martin get five.  Up until now, I would not have given five stars to any Wheel of Time books until now.  Wonderful ending with sadness and joy, victory and defeat, and life and death.  The perfect ending to this unforgettable series.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|In an ever increasingly stressful life this game promises the best feeling of false accomplishment since my community college days.
B003L77G8I|5.0|LOVE THE SERIES, BUT, AGAIN, THE CHARACTERS DEVELOPMENT IS WHAT REALLY MAKES ME LOVE THE PROGRAM.<br />i don't like all the graphic &#34;deadly&#34; details, even though i know it's a crime show.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This story had an interesting twist and kept me reading to find out why & how the main character would evelve.
B00943SQCI|3.0|Depp always does a good job with shadowy roles. If you liked Edward Scissorhands, you'll like this one. Funny and entertaining.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|A great combination of history and fiction. An easy read. All I can say is it is clear that Follet has never broken a rib.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Even better than the first book, if that is possible, which I had some real doubts, can't wait to start book 3.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Love the game I mean you go back in time to play with Om nom's ancestors. It is so cool.
B0037471TE|5.0|A great story but with a lot of padding and unlikely situations. Not sure if I will try the other episodes.
B0015DYIH2|4.0|This was by far my favorite twilight book. Much less romance (yay) and a very unique plot. A very good read. I enjoyed the book more than I thought I would. A job well done by Stephanie Meyers. :-[ (vampire smiley face)
B009CGDOQU|5.0|Classic, gutteral comedy stands the test of time.  It may gross out some folks,<br />but great characters, led by Belushi in his prime, with campus antics<br />anchoring whole movie.  Any U of O people will recognize most of campus shots<br />centered around Hayward Field and Erbe Memorial Union.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|You must see season's one and two before season 3 if you want the whole picture..This is a fabulous story with a lot of mini plots woven into the main plot..Each episode leaves one anxiously awaiting the next episode..The actors are so outstanding in their parts one would think we were actually watching reality TV.  I recommend the entire series to anyone who enjoys any kind of TV..I have had two evenings of continuous showings at my house and we hated to interrupt for dinner but managed to break ourselves away for a meal and then quickly resumed with another episode..It's just a marvelous series.. I highly recommend.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is awasome because.....I just like finding diamonds iron and gold. It's awasome I like the houses you can make it tests you imagination.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a story that will have you in its grips right away.. It would be helpful to see season 1 before season 2 to get the whole picture..This is a fabulous story of the life and times in 1920 of an Enlish Manor House family..There are many subplots in addition to the main plot that will grab your interest and you will have to continue on with Season 3.  The acting is superb..I have watched through season 3 and can't wait until season 4. I ordered the streaming Amazon British version.
0385751060|4.0|My son was reading this book in school and he loved it. He does not like to read much but this book had caught his attention and began to do further research on the history of the concentration camps.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I loved playing a different version of this game on the computer when I was younger, so I already knew I would like this game but I would say that this game is awesome because it lets you shuffle as much as you want to clear the board!
B003WUYRGI|1.0|This book is an important book because it gives you the proper pronounced words and the meaning of that word.
B00005JKHP|5.0|I was so happy to find this movie to finish my collection of the Star Trek series.  Received it in record time.  Awsome.
B000HKYN74|5.0|As a self professed Trekkie I didn't think I would like this series, but I found it to be one of the best series seasons of the Trek franchise. I am soooo happy they are on Amazon Prime now
B009IF8CH6|5.0|So hooked on this one. Over the top in so many subtle ways. Speaks to where comedy should be moving.
B009T8XBBO|5.0|I got this for the young'uns yep it is just what I wanted... hand over the Kindle and let them play.... fun app great graphics

B00AAQWMB4|2.0|I have yet to figure out how to play this alone... I have no interest in competing on my mobile device. There should be an option to play against the machine... if there is I have not found it.
B000SLP4SE|4.0|I was looking for an entertaining action movie with some suspense and this filled the bill. Acting was so-so, but I wasn't looking for a piece of art, just a good movie.
B004TI1WME|5.0|Having a virtual tape following your entries is huge when entering a string of numbers. Easy to see buttons.... Good App.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|A curious hybrid of hip hop and baroque pop, Del Rey pantomimes the vapid and extravagant lifestyles of the upper echelon. Songs like \\"National Anthem\\" and \\"Off to the Races\\" are indicative of this. The album is an endless trail of woozy, mid-summery ballads that unabashedly reflect how young people find, fall into, and end romantic relationships. Every song is a masterpiece, even the album's most boring tracks (\\"This Is What Makes Us Girls\\" and \\"Radio\\") are well-produced and well-written. Conceptually, the album starts at the end; \\"Born To Die\\" highlights the sad, opened-endedness one feels at the peak of recovering from a bad relationship. But, before the narrator fully reaches that denouement, she drags us through a dreary film reel of the worst and best times she shared with her lover. By \\"Dark Paradise\\", we exit Eden and enter emotional hell. First, we are stunned, then we are sad and weepy, by \\"Million Dollar Man\\" we are righteously vengeful, yet somehow realizing we'll be okay. With the closing track, however, instead of feeling uplifted and ready to try love again, the theme twists around, blaming the fate of the entire romance on a woman's perceived fickleness and imperfection. It could have ended better. All in all, the album is an excellent social commentary on the perils of love and excess, with enough unique sounds and vocal acrobats to redeem such the tirelessly overdone cliche. Employing an alternative rap technique on \\"Diet Mountain Dew\\", \\"Off to the Races\\", and \\"National Anthem\\", the latter is the album's biggest embarrassment redeemed only by a tasteful music video that aims to reenact the Assassination of JFK. The first two, however, drape softcore rap over sleepy trip hop beats for a yummy, lachrymose snack. The album's highlights are: \\"Born To Die\\", \\"Video Games\\", \\"Million Dollar Man\\", and \\"Diet Mountain Dew\\". The weakest songs are: \\"National Anthem\\", \\"This Is What Makes Us Girls\\", and \\"Radio\\".
B001MS7IBS|5.0|Fringe finally came to Netflix not long ago, so I popped on the first episode one evening. I had always been interested in the concept of the show, but had never actually seen it. After I watched that first one, though... I was hooked.<br /><br />I quickly blasted through the first season, and I'm now well into the second. This is one of those rare shows that grips and keeps me engaged throughout. For any fan of science fiction, I would recommend Fringe- it's fast, fun, and smart. Each episode is marvelously paced, providing a good romp for its 42-50 minute run time. The ideas presented in each show are original and intriguing, providing ample mystery and intrigue, while intelligently tying them into the larger story arc that runs throughout the series. The writers and producers of the show are to be commended, for they are willing to sacrifice fairly major characters (instilling the feeling that nobody is \\"safe\\"), and they never string you along for too long. This isn't a show like \\"Lost\\", where mysteries are indefinitely put on hold. They will present a good conflict or mystery, and have it wrapped up within a few episodes, providing an immensely satisfying viewing experience- something I rarely get from TV shows.<br /><br />The cast is excellent, with the character of Walter Bishop being my favorite. I've never seen this actor before, but he's fantastic! He does an excellent job of portraying the \\"mad scientist\\" role. Blessed with a genius level of intellect and an ability to problem solve like nobody's business, he can achieve results that no one else can. These gifts are cleverly balanced against an oft-times \\"too\\" powerful curiosity, which drives him into morally ambiguous areas. His personality is also an interesting mishmash of charisma and anti-social behavior, and it's clear that the strange machinations of his mind have turned him into one odd duck. Walter's explorations into what has been deemed \\"fringe science\\" are an exciting experience, to say the least, and this is a show that I would recommend to anybody who likes good drama, and they want to try something a little different from all the typical \\"police procedural\\" series out there.st, and this is a show that I would recommend to anybody who likes good drama, and they want to try something a little different from all the typical \\"police procedural\\" series out there.
B001JYEMOQ|5.0|One of my favorite movie ever! I hate predictable plots and villains. I always figure out whats going to happen before other people, so THIS movie was refreshing and kept me holding my breath!  LOVE this movie!
B004J4XGN6|4.0|It's a &#34;must read&#34; for people aspiring to become entrepreneurs and do not necessarily have a background in business. It's a methodical book but with real life examples shared in each chapter.
B00CATSONE|5.0|What an unfortunate genius - he kept on plowing along with new ideas, and did not give up or take revenge on the many people who took advantage of him. - what a pity that this man wasn't allowed to reap the benefits of his great mind!
0307352153|3.0|It seemed like this book went too far afield sometimes in the research brought in to support statements.  I almost wrote &#34;arguments&#34; but honestly, I don't even know the main issues this author was arguing for.  Are introverts better than extroverts or just different?  After reading this book, I can't answer that question.  All I know is that introverts have skills that could balance out extraverts and that is good.  However, did we need a 300+ page to know that?  I think the author's arguments and supporting studies could have been done in half the pages.
B00BJ9VBLI|3.0|I like it, but it is not really different than all the other jewel games, at least as far as I have gone.  They are great for passing the time, but the chained squares and such just seem like &#34;I try to be different&#34; than the other game with  blocked squares.  Like all jewel games, it is GREAT for passing the time sitting in an airport,
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I was mesmerized by the way the book was written, it was as if I was there. It was hard to put the book down .. I absolutely loved it, I surely hope beautiful darkness will be as good or better than Beautiful Creatures.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is very fun I enjoy playing it and I love the fact that I'm good at it and I love horses
B00CP2Z5TC|3.0|I fully admit that my opinion was affected by all the positive press this album received before it was released - I was expecting a lot.  I loved their first album, didn't love the second one, but it grew on me.  This one was promoted as a maturation of their sound, a step forward, really solid.<br /><br />I found it mostly boring and over produced.  I know bands change and should continue to grow, but their sound has really changed from four guys in a room with some really effective string additions to what could be a solo garageband project from any brooklyn writer.  It's a very quiet record for the most part, with repetitive choruses and a lack of standout instrumental hooks.<br /><br />On the other hand:  The album has a good flow - it starts quiet and slow and builds up before quieting again.  Diane Young is a lot of fun, and still strange and new.  Ezra's lyrics are great as usual - thoughtful, witty, funny in places (&#34;you've got the luck of a Kennedy&#34;).<br /><br />I'll see if this grows on me.  It may just not be my thing.  Good for them for trying new things.  I miss the sound of the first album - but that's all the more reason for me to go pick up a guitar and try to make music like that.  They try new things that I find hit or miss here, but they can't play the same thing forever, of course.
B001XV09UG|1.0|This is an indulgent waste of time. Foolish with a pretense of depth, but that is all...just pretense. Bad filmmaking acting and story telling.
B006P4FBUE|4.0|I thought at first that the rest of my family would tire of this very quickly, but so far it's still a hit! Maybe it's due to the tutor on it that teaches you a list of songs, or that you can change the sound to different instruments. Either way, I still find my young daughter playing it as well as my husband.
B009MF56GC|3.0|The was over the top .it was ok. It still ok to buy it .maybe part 3 will be better
B008602KQI|3.0|It took me a long time to even want to watch this. Very sad bleak story line. But as far as the acting and scenery goes it was very good. Thankfully it was not as graphic as I feared it might be. I do plan on seeing the upcoming sequel.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|I just started to watch this show .i heard about it for year know i got time to watch it now
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars because the story line is very good and the book is well written!  I loved the characters and how the author intertwined them.  I would highly recommend reading this book!
B000I9U75G|3.0|I watched this purely for the entertainment value.  Big dinosaur smashing buildings, inept army blowing things up, mildly interesting love story.  Yeah, not the greatest movie, but kind of fun.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|awsome fun cool game i have fun playing it i dont care wut u think but i like it thanks for reading this
B005P4PAVK|5.0|I love this group of actors and, more importantly, the premise.  Growing up, and still pretty much, a nerd, I really identify with the struggles and absurdities of their lives.  The &#34;jokes&#34; can be a little strained, but overall this show keeps me laughing... loudly.
B00AAQWMB4|3.0|This game is not the match 3 that I like it is very slow running on my tablet,  as well as very boring
B00BLCHZC2|4.0|Excellent production value, realistic living conditions and cultural realities, excellent acting and interesting characters.  Plus amazing location cinematography although I would have liked seeing more of the landscape.  I think that's important when you're dealing with the northern cultures where their geographic location is so central to who they are as a people.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|We enjoy watching it as a family.  We were glad to see Castle and Beckett get together but that didn't detract from the great stories!
B00821OX98|3.0|The acting is bland and the characters are not very deep.  All put together, not very interesting.  Why can't Scy Fy make a good show?
B00COGXX7A|5.0|One of those love stories that ends nicely.  A feel good movie.  Highly recommend it for all ages.  Well worth the price
B00AECGQF2|4.0|It's a fun game but I can't find the place where the pictures are... please help. Anyway, I think this is a fun game.

B009EELBIS|5.0|High resolution was worth the extea $$$. Our family loves this classic, true story musical.  The movie is almost 3 hours long ... but it does not feel like it.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Forget the movie (although I have to say it stayed fairly true to the book). Hugo is a master!  A great love story as well as a great history of 19th century France. Hugo mixes in essays along the way, some of them fascinating, others dull.  I've read quite a lot about the battle of Waterloo and Hugo's version is the best I've read.<br />  Don't be put off by the length. I didn't want it to end.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|This season has a deepening of Becket and Castle's relationship.  Which, I must say, is refreshing that they actually moved to a relationship instead of keeping the sexual tension artificially high. The Becket character showed many more layers and complexity from the revenge driven justice machine of early seasons.  Mal Castle.  :),  maintains a boyish irreverence and sense of wonder that makes you root for him even when he is the butt of the joke.  The expansion of his family's complexity added to the series without overwhelming the &#34;buddy&#34; feel of the show.  All the characters in the series are just hitting their stride and bringing a sense of fun to their parts that make watching them very enjoyable.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I like this game - different ways to play depending on how much time you have.  I like the timing feature and enjoy beating my previous record.
B007704HO6|5.0|This is a wonderful story, factual and heartwarming. If you're a cat lover you will adore it, if you're human you will be touched by the tale of one mans struggle to improve his life alongside that of an extraordinary cat called Bob. The proceeds from this title also go to a great cause, bonus! Go for it and place yourself an order you'll be glad that you did.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|My daughters favorite fairy princess movies. she watches it several times a week. Cant wait for the sequel to come out
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|When the vocal begins on the opening track, \\"The One Who Loves You Now,\\" you're instantly transported back to the 1970's, when the same voice would permeate the radio airwaves with such hits as \\"Waterloo,\\" \\"Fernando,\\" and (the still tremendously popular) \\"Mamma Mia.\\" The hits of the Swedish super-group ABBA still inundate the Broadway stage at the Winter Garden Theater, but we now have brand new material from the blonde, silky-voiced Agnetha F&auml;ltskog, with her new release, simply titled \\"A.\\"<br /><br />With her first album of original material in 25 years, F&auml;ltskog delivers the same youthful sound that brought her and her bandmates to superstardom almost four decades ago.  The singer was approached by award-winning producers Jorgen Elofsson (who is responsible for hits by Britney Spears, Kelly Clarkson and Celine Dion, among many others) and Peter Nordahl about creating a new set of music, and together they've created a genuine, sincere ten-song release that features F&auml;ltskog in various styles, and yet she never falters to deliver an engaging performance.  From her mid-pop duet with Gary Barlow (the British pop singer who also serves as head judge on the U.K.'s \\"The X Factor\\") on \\"I Should've Followed You Home,\\" to \\"Dance Your Pain Away,\\" which could easily have been an ABBA hit circa 1978 (think \\"Super Trouper\\"), F&auml;ltskog seamlessly weaves her way through each tune. The album concludes with the yearning ballad, \\"I Keep Them On The Floor Beside My Bed,\\" the first tune the songstress has co-written in many years.<br /><br />Many years may have passed since ABBA's heyday, but F&auml;ltskog's voice (though the singer is now a grandmother!) remains as timeless as ever.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Jaycee told her story as honestly as she can. She admittedly jumps around a lot in her reported memories, but explains that this is how her mind is working right now. She is confused, but working to figure out her life-as a product of her past, and with hope for her future of herself and her girls. Thank you, Jaycee, for writing this very difficult piece of work. You have already done, and I believe always will, do great things with your life!!
B00BVVA138|4.0|Even though I'm a huge fan of Howard Jones as the lead singer, I have to say that if anyone was to take his place it should be the person who's place he took. Jessie is an amazing singer and this album may just be there best work with him as lead singer!
B009NY43NY|4.0|Enjoyed book. Fitting end to the saga. Seemed as though it could be continued at a later date. That would be fine with me.. Have enjoyed the books more consistently than the HBO series. Wish series would stick closer to books. The series is based REALLY LOOSELY and book storyline is better to me. I will miss these books.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Unfortunately. this roller coaster ride of a \\"who done it\\" falls short of expectations for the characters, while given detailed back stories and are meticulously drawn, are so unlikable that it is difficult to empathize with them or care about them.  Even worse, I came to despise all of the characters.  They were an odious lot.  For this reason I chose to quickly read through the pages to get to the denouement and be through with this novel that was replete with contrivances and unlikable characters.  In my opinion this novel belongs in the horror genre.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Great album, I usually always find a song I don't like in albums, but this one I like all of them. She plays great along with her producer!
B005UPOAT2|5.0|This is a definite chick flick and I Love NYC so this movie is such a romantic chick flick to watch when my husband is not around, a rainy day or just want a really great romantic chick flick. One of my favorites,
B0086700CM|1.0|this game sucked because it dose not include inough fun or activity for children and also because I said it suked
B005PK56TA|5.0|This show was extremely entertaining.  Every episode felt like I was watching a movie.  I watched all of Season 1 in a little over a week...I couldn't wait to catch the next show.<br /><br />There are some &#34;suggestive&#34; scenes but no body parts shown, it was just getting the point across of what was going on.  Other than that the music and the sounds made it feel like a movie.<br /><br />If you're considering it, watch the 1st episode and you will either like it or not.  I was hooked after the 1st show.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|This is, in my opinion, an extremely well researched book!  It was almost too technical in part to read quickly, but was educational and very interesting.
B00425S1H8|5.0|Is been working perfect with zero issues so far. The best USB to RS-232 adapter I've have, no doubts. Nothing else to say.
B0007TKNII|4.0|The movie was actually a Christmas present for my sister and she loves it. Doesn't have any problems with it and the case was in good condition. Overall very good!
0618918248|5.0|I've been a non-believer since ever, but I only realized I was an Atheist after reading this book. It helped me organizing my mind about the concept of god in a trully brilliant way. Humanity owes a lot to Mr. Richard Dawkins, this book is a must read for everyone.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|I got this as a Christmas gift for my husband since he hasn't seen it and it works great. Doesn't skip and the case looks great!
B00338QENI|5.0|This was an excellent book and a must read for all researchers. I applaud Ms. Skloot for sharing the untold story of Henrietta Lacks.

B000FCKC4C|3.0|This book will help give you the courage to break away with what you are doing to persue your dreams. I will always refer to my highlights throughout my life having said that there is way to much filler this book could have been half the size it is. It should have been the same pages as the book who moved my cheese. save a bunch of time and just google the summery and best quotes to go back on.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|This movie was bought as a present and it works great! It doesn't skip and it got here just in time for Christmas!

B000JLTRIG|5.0|The case was a little worn out but the only thing that mattered was that the discs didn't skip and they worked properly!
B00COGZ8FU|1.0|Any movie that stars Tom Cruise has got to be a big dud.  The last movie I watched with Tom was Rain Man. That was back when I was still too naive to know better...

B009R659L8|5.0|I love all Mary Higgins Clark books.  I've read each one, some twice.  The stories are always suspenseful , and the characters believable. This particular book kept you guessing til the end.  I would think I had it figured out, only to find out I didn't.  I was surprised at the end.  Love books that keep you guessing.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|It kept me so interested throughout the entire book. Will have to read more of Kate Morton. Must read more.
B005HSL626|4.0|Very good game, not highly violent, and yet gives you the feel of action and excitement, plus a degree of violence that is acceptable. On the minus side, I do think it gets too hard too fast.
0316228532|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book but probably would not have chosen it if I knew there would be disturbing scenes with children.
193700788X|4.0|I just finished reading Dead Ever After and am unsure how I feel about the book itself and the series ending.  I did love Eric - I almost cried at the end of book four.  I reread books 8 - 12 before reading this one to reestablish 'Sookie world' in my brain. I agree with some reviewers that the way Eric just faded away seemed very unlike his character.  While I knew deep down that Sookie and Eric would not be forever (and Sam did seem quite obvious), Eric just letting her go without bloodshed (think Felipe's or Freyda's) seem wrong.<br /><br />I really liked the many 'old' characters that were brought back for their endings.  I don't really believe Claude at the end - that one seems too contrived. Niall would KNOW that Claude would try to hurt Sookie - he would never allow that situation.<br /><br />Bottom line - I'm sad - Sad for the ending of a great series and sad for Sookie and Eric breaking up.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|Great mobile version of Adobe.  Makes my Kindle easier to use.  I recommend this app highly to anyone with a mobile device.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|Great film that really centers itself around the balance between caprices and family allegiances.  Definitely a movie to rent and snuggle with wife to watch.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This is a great app to clean out the junk from your mobile device.  I use this with my Kindle and it cleans all the temp files, and other things that waste valuable space.
B00AKKTDJY|1.0|After buying the game, you have to buy more levels? Deleted immediately! PlayFirst used to have such fun games, but now they're just nickel and diming!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|With each season, the stories & characters continue to grow.  The actors & writers have yet to fail in delivering top-notch entertainment.  I'm looking forward to Season 11!!!
076781326X|5.0|This wonderful movie was quite simply the best movie musical ever.  I saw the stage musical in London in 1967, and then a year later saw this movie.  Not hampered by the limitations of a stage, this movie version expanded in all possible directions like a balloon let out of a box.  It was almost overwhelming.  Indeed, it was at times almost absurd.  The whole cast was perfect.  I saw it with my mother and we both loved it.  It is unfortunate that Jack Wild later became a substance abuser and died prematurely.  One prefers to forget that and remember him as the Dodger.
193700788X|1.0|This book was exactly what the rest of the series was... awful. HBO has done a much better job than Charlaine Harris has ever could with this story.
B004LLDN3A|5.0|I saw this wonderful movie twice, once in 1964 when it first came out, and again late in 1966, shortly after Disney's death, with a French soundtrack at a theatre in Rabat, Morocco.  I enjoyed it both times, although it did seem a bit strange to hear Julie and Dick singing in French (seemingly).  This was one of those lavish blockbuster musicals where every song and every dance had to be expanded almost to absurdity.  The Sherman brothers came through as never before or since, and the cast was perfect.  I had seen Julie Andrews in Camelot on Broadway in 1961, but she was even better in this film.
B0063M22QO|5.0|So much fun to be mobile with my Mahjong app. I enjoy quiet moments playing Mahjong.  What a great app.
B001QW8QYS|5.0|Although I was only six years old when I saw this (when it first came out), I somewhat dimly remember Sir Peter Ustinov's brilliant portrayal of the nutty Emperor Nero surveying a model of the Rome that would be built after he had the old Rome burnt down.  I had a life-long fascination with history and was lucky enough to grow up at a time when Hollywood was mass-producing spectacular films about ancient Rome.  I think that this was the first of them.  If the years have wiped from my memory all other recollection of this film, one could still never forget Ustinov.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|Take the life stories of people through generations and then link them together.  There are about 5 stories taking place at different times, different locations, all performed by the same actors wearing extreme makeup and costumes.  The computer generator graphics of a future city was pretty impressive.  Some of the actors has a shooting star / comet birthmark that I never did ascertain the significance.  Acting just okay.  Plot? Too abstract and new-age for me.
B003CYKCHW|5.0|I have had this mouse for a year now and I love it. it is comfortable and sturdy as well as stylish. It has lasted a hole lot longer than the cheap PC mice that I have bought. The braided cable makes it harder for my cat to chew it in two. And I can wipe a lemon across it to keep the cat away from it. Cats tend to hate citric acids and the fibers hold the scent of the lemon acting as cat repellant but enough so my cat still curls up in my lap.<br />Just remember to blow the dust out of the lens from time to time and you should be fine and dandy.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|I liked this movie.  The plot is fairly simple and straight forward.  It is predictable.  The action is good.  The acting is believable.<br />I liked Tom Cruise's part in the movie.  He played your basic tough guy veteran with a military police background.  He likes living unplugged and off the conventional social grid.  I think Cruise is getting better since he starting producing his own movies.

B0041KKYCY|4.0|This movie was very good. I like what I call get back movies.The story plot was kind of old time everybody has done rape movies but this one has a womens point of view and the women in the movie does what every women wants to do.to anyone who attacks them. I would have givin the movie 5 stars but the acting had a lot to be desired, it was like some one made a home movie as far as the acting went. The special effects were good. its not rated and should stay this way....
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I enjoyed this book immensely. Martin has a very descriptive way of writing, which is both a gift and a curse. I love losing myself in the pages, it is easy to do. However, there are just waaay too many characters. I care for the core characters from the first book and not necessarily the minutiae of every scribe/knight/family member of said core. I will read the next book, then reread all of them, as I am hooked.
B001GKJ2FM|3.0|I choose this rating because this movie was used and didnt cost much..The movie its self was the same old story about a young whore growing older without knowing who the father of her child was the only difference in this movie and divorce Italian style with sophie Loren is divorce italian style was funny and they didnt sing in each others faces. I found the location very lazy living.  As far as acting Meryl Streep played a better whore in the movie Bridges of madison county. All in all I think I was very charitable with the rating. We wont watch it again..
0691126658|5.0|This field guide covers the countries of Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi and includes some 1388 species with 3400 illustrations of adult male and female plus juvenile and moulting plumages. The art work is some of the best and most consistent of any field guide I've used. The artwork is crisp and detailed with very good colors and none of the plates are overcrowded though as is true with most filed guides the raptors and other species seen in flight as well as perched more often have several flight shots which can get a bit bunched up especially with the many color morphs of the raptors but they are still discernible to which species with lines separating them.  The range maps in close to the spine which means you have to have the guide all the way open to really see them and they are all one color so you need to read the descriptions to see what time of year they are in that part of the world. The descriptions are good and cover several plumages and characteristics and habitat and habits are covered as well as voice. The index comes in a Latin and Common Name choice which helps as well as a couple of maps of east Africa and important bird areas. Considering the scope of this book the artwork is more consistent than some field guides I've come across with half the species, a credit to the artists. For the region this is one of the most complete guides and a must for those visiting the region. It makes a great companion the Birds of the Horn of Africa which sports the same artists and much of the same artwork making it a nice pair of field guides to the wide array of species in the region.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0691143455 Birds of the Horn of Africa: Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti, Somalia, and Socotra (Princeton Field Guides)]]

B004PGNB1K|5.0|Patrick Rothfus has a poetic style of writing that weaves a certain magic into the world he's created. I loved being sucked into the story and it's many elements and literally couldn't put the book down. I read this book in one sitting that finished at 6am the following morning and I do not regret a minute of it.
B0063IH60K|2.0|I prefer spider Solitare. I didn't understand this version and had no pleasure in trying to learn. Did not hold my interest at all.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|This story had me hooked so quickly I almost missed it and then goes on to paint a vivid and exciting world unlike anything else I've read.
B0012HEB32|5.0|This series had a lot of interesting things to say, some cool tech and robots fighting.  Between robot fights and explosions it wanted you to think about things.<br /><br />This is one of Sarah's narrations when she may have come across one of the creators of Skynet:<br />On July sixteenth, nineteen forty-five, in the mountains outside of Los Alamos, New Mexico, the world's first atomic bomb exploded. The white light pierced the sky with such intensity that a blind girl claimed to see the flash from a hundred miles away. After witnessing the explosion, J. Robert Oppenheimer quoted a fragment of the Bhagavad Gita, declaring, &#34;Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.&#34; His colleague, Ken Bainbridge, put it another way when he leaned close to Oppenheimer and whispered, &#34;Now we're all sons of bitches.&#34;<br /><br />It takes them a couple of episodes to get their formula right so stick with it.  You'll be glad you did.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I'm just finishing this second book of the Century Trilogy.  I can't wait for the third.  Follett is incredible.  The characters are real, the storyline is fantastic and he captures the &#34;times&#34; perfectly.  If you just want to enjoy a truly great read, pick up this book.  But, I advise you to read the first book of the trilogy, The Fall of the Giants, first -- it's equally as good and sets up this story...  Enjoy!
B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|Great!this was a gift for my child she absolutely loves watching this DVD. Will by again soon. Great having digital copy
1580812635|5.0|This book an all time classic. I bought it for my Mom, whom is 90 years old. She is from Oklahoma. In the middle of writing her autobiography she wanted to read what had been said about the migration of people from her state to California. Wow she did not like what had been written. During the same time as her family moved across America (USA) the Dust Bowl had taken place. That caused so many people ending up settling in CA that the people here did not have anything good to say about the travelers. You know her autobiography will not be positive about this book. I read it and also found it to be disrespectful about my family. This fact does not make it a bad book. We just didn't like some of the content.
B000IDGBWU|5.0|Ive seen this movie 4 or 5 times and still enjoy it .I was in the USN in 1963 and the music brings back the memories . The cars the styles .One of my all time favorites
B009NX409M|5.0|I saw this movie a long time ago and loved it.  It was a great surprise to find it again.  Thank you
B000000WCV|5.0|While Daft Punk may be taking a newer direction with &#34;Random Access Memories, Homework was widely imitated through the sound of 2000's music. It's originality and overall quality are something I have yet to see matched.
B0090XLDKY|5.0|Excellent movie and very enjoyable to watch. Wish there were more like it today. I recommend for all to watch.
B009MYARIK|3.0|I have loved every other Sophie Kinsella book I've read.  (I've read all of them she's written under that name.)  This book was a disappointment.  The main issue was that I just didn't care that much about the main character, Lottie.  She is shallow and impulsive, and I just didn't care who she ended up with.  I did, however, greatly enjoy the story line involving Fliss and Lorcan.  If this book would have been their story, I would've enjoyed it much more.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Personally I liked Dungeon Hunter 3.  I thought it lacked an adventurous feel instead of it being like a gladiator arena.  This game is by far better than I would have thought.  The game play is the same except you fight through a story line!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book drew me in with its emotion especially about three-quarters in. I was only looking for a quick read and got a favorite instead. I really enjoyed it!
193700788X|1.0|I pretty much agree with everything all of the low reviews say.  I feel as if someone who had only a slight knowledge of these characters wrote this book!  I believe Charlaine drug the books on just to get every penny she could out of her loyal fan base.  Also whats the deal with the timeline only being over a period of two years!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I chose this book from lots of recommendations.  I was disappointed to find out what Christian Grey really wanted, but like the way it was turned around to make it sexy.

0307720748|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It's unbelievable the amount of success that Richard Branson has come into through pure hard work and determination.  He is proof that it is not always what you know, but who you know.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|One of the most addicting games ever. Real easy to past a good 30 min without even knowing. You will find it hard to stop once you start. New towers are also awesome.
142314189X|4.0|Great Stories!  Can not wait for all the film adaptations to come out.  Definitely for an over 13 reader.  Could not put it down.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Another excellent book. I had read some of the reviews prior to reading the book and was afraid it was not going to be as good as the first one but it was.

B0051ANPZQ|4.0|I started reading this book as part of a school wide read at one of the middle schools I was subbing at and was enjoying it so bought it so I could finish it. It does a good job of showing different perspectives and how the same events can effect different people. It is a good book to read with preteens to help facilitate a discussion about bullying and tolerance.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|The game has good graphics and it is a little had to do when you first start to play but it gets Easier as you play
B00BBW16HW|5.0|An Amazing story of two men from different worlds come together. A story of friendship, laughter and love.  It is a must see!

B009GED3HS|1.0|This whole season i've felt cheated.  Save for some funny times by Barney. Really end it on a high note, don't punish fans.
1400052181|4.0|I only stumbled across this book because it was chosen as our monthly read. Though all the scientific jargon had me struggling, it was a very interesting story. I think it was a great mixture of science and reality. Information I would have never been aware of. AND my heart went out to the Lacks family. Not one easily moved to tears, I had a few form during this tale. I would love to see someone from the Lacks excel and beat the odds, break the cycle. It still seems there is some injustice here. WE (every human being) owe our lives to Henrietta. Very informative and interesting read.<br /><br />EyeCU Reading Approved.
B007SGM084|5.0|Great series could barely put it down! Read the whole series in two weeks!Can not wait for the movie! Love the books!
B000TETD9Q|5.0|I owned this CD along time ago and have no idea what happened to it. The Beach Boys are an important staple in any rock music collection. Their music represents a style and time that has long passed. And, since it is summer, what better music to play!
B009OYSFDM|3.0|So very comic book camp, and yet still fun to watch. Good story lines, I like the flashbacks, which is unusual because I often find them boring.
B00123LIPK|5.0|This is a great collection of Madonna earlier works. There is no deep message. This music won't change your life. However, if you want a great collection of 80s songs that is fun to dance with and sing a long with, then this is one to own.
B009GEFXLC|3.0|Even though, or probably because of, this season just was not as good as earlier season. Still like the show and will continue watching
B00122A28A|5.0|I was a punk rocker in my teens, but I always had a soft spot for Madonna and Michael Jackson although I would not have admitted it back then. I love to dance, and Madonna's music is fun and very danceable. This is a great CD and very different from a lot of her other work. Madonna continues to evolve her musical stylings and sound.
B009LH1Y1W|4.0|I really enjoy this show, though the story line is a bit old. However, the characters, especial Cas, are interesting and engaging. Keep going!
B001YXS7JI|5.0|I love Dire Straits, and I think Mark Knopfler is a fantastic guitar player. The song, Sultans of Swing is one of my all time favorites. But, this collection also includes other great hits like: Money for Nothing, Walk of Life, and So Far Away. Great band! Great CD!
B00CM6ZLG8|5.0|Demi is a personal friend and i love her Dearly!!!<br />another Fine Release!!!<br />the songs that stand out the most are &#34;Nightengale&#34; and &#34;Heart Attack<br />love you Demi
B004GFN11A|5.0|What a cool little application! The only thing I'd like to see is the entire page on my kindle. Other than that, I like it!
0062238868|2.0|After reading some of the reviews here, I was very keen to read this book. But once I started, it felt like I was reading a highly edited version with all the details removed. This book is way to vague, no details about missions or his kills. Basically \\"I went on a mission and shot some bad guys\\" I get it, he shot a lot of bad dudes. Want a sniper tale that puts you behind the scope. Read Sniper One - by a british sniper Iraq or Marine Sniper 93 Confirmed Kills - by Carlos Hathcock Vietnam.
B007BT0RKG|1.0|This was another application that was not what I expected. A waist of time to load onto my kindle. Couldn't wait to delete it.
B000IZ7YMY|5.0|This is one of my favorite all-time movies.  Beautiful cinematography, great story, good acting all around.  Worth watching again and again.

B00992CF6W|4.0|I love this game and I royalty recomemd it but I gave is only 4 stars because it does not work so well in multiplayer but I don't no if it is just the tablets! so Yahoo :)
B003Z49LYO|3.0|I wish that it was more than a handful of shows. maybe it would have made more sense. watching the girl slaving in too many scene was a waste one was enough to get the drift that it was hard life.
B007TNQ7EY|1.0|I had to delete everything and there's still no room to play it I don't know why they would put something with so much memory on this
B0060AY6FO|2.0|It just plods along, pretty boring most of the time, hard to read on my Kindle because I want to go back and read about characters to keep up with who they are in the story.  May be okay for a regular book but no on my Kindle.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|The game is a lot of fun when you have nothing else to do. Not quite to the point that you can't wait to play it though
B007681WRY|5.0|An adult film- great actors -an amazing story beautifully told. I enjoyed seeing veteren actors  when they were so young.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Fun game but I just wish you could get stuff easier  like experience and coins but it is still a good game
B007PVHMCG|5.0|I had to wait 6 months for this item to be available on Amazon for it's list price, but it was well worth the wait.<br /><br />The kit is SMALL.  It's part of the micro-series from Lego so the whole thing is tiny, but the detail is exquisite!  The whole thing took my about 3 hours to build (I'm a bit out of practice with Legos) and it was pure joy.<br /><br />If you love Minecraft, and are filled with nostalgia when you play with Legos, this is well worth the price tag!  Just make sure you buy it at it's REAL price, and not at the INFLATED price that toy speculators try to sell it at when it's out of stock elsewhere.
B007WFTFG6|3.0|I thought my great grandson would really like this, but it really didn't hold his interest.used it but not long.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|I enjoyed this movie very much.  It opens your eyes as to the things that could have happened long ago.  It is definitely not recommended for young children.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Haven't even tried it. Great grandson put it on when he had the Kindle.<br />Will try myself in the near future.  Finally tried this application and it is great. Never get too far, but it is fun getting there.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is by far one of the best series I've read. The characters have such exorbitant you will fall in love. Definitely a great read.

B005H9B44A|3.0|I loved Avengers, and watched Thor after I saw Avengers.  The plot had a lot of potential, but ultimately fell short of my expectations.  It's alright, but nothing special.

B0088W7VNG|5.0|Season 5 is one of the better seasons for Atlantis.  Started out great, a great mid season two part episode with a favorite guest star, and a decent finale.  My only qualm is that it's the end with no long term wrap up, but that's not the season's fault.  MGM left them hanging.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|So glad this product has came out for android,  it is needed for a lot of applications that I receive in emails.

B000GCFG7E|5.0|I started the series when the movie came out and I always have the next book ready to start when I finish the one I'm reading.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|This is far from simplistic on all levels.  It it politically on target, as far as I have been able to sermise what succeeds in politics.  It is psycologically on target, demonstrating the conflicts a woman faces between raising her children with trust in their parents and the emotional pull of abandoning herself to the love of someone who sees her for the intelligent  fresh  perspective she brings rather than being a husbent absorbed by his own career and who sees her as an adjunct to his ambitions.  Added to this is flawless acting, compelling writing and plot development and a host of amazing supporting characters.  I also learned a lot about legal strategy.  Worthwhile o all levels.
B000YJ54DU|5.0|I started the series when the movie came out and I always have the next book ready to start when I finish the one I'm reading.

B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I just started reading the book on my Kindle Paperwhite.  As always, Jodi Picoult's books are great reading and hard to put down.
B00007K02F|5.0|I was very pleased with the DVD.  It arrive on time and met all of my expectations.  The DVD was in very good shape.<br /><br />Thanks.
B009OYTIXS|5.0|This show is the next step in superhero shows.  It proves that a show can incorporate a number of classical parts of its comic origins in a sustainable fashion that develop over an entire season.  Rather than invent a villain, they took a classic Green Arrow villain and successfully modified it to makes sense in a TV format.  The characters are well developed and you really learn to care about them over the season.  The settings are beautifully done, and the flashbacks are well-placed and make a lot of sense in context, as well as adding to the depth of the universe.  I can't wait until the second season.
B006M4F67A|4.0|Best 99¢ I have spent in a long time!!  This is so very very addicting!  Only complaint is sometimes you have to tap the tiles multiple times to clear them.  Makes it harder to race the clock....  But it is a GREAT version and fun fun to play!!!
0743435729|5.0|This book is one of the best I have ever read, hands down.  The characters and world are complex and engaging, deeply sympathetic (even the bad guys) and easily able to understand, even when they are extremely wrong.  The worms of men and women that form the enemy are hated, but their humanity remains intact, and not all of them are so despicable.  I would recommend this book to anybody interested at all in fiction that concerns itself with deep character development and with the ideals of honor and duty.  Though American and thus not enamored of a monarchy, I find the sense of royalist duty in this book to be truly inspiring and at times, heartbreaking.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Love it first time gamer love it just needs a update I believe 0.7.0 any who lots of fun if you love legos your going to love this game.  PLEASE KEEP UPDATES ^_^

B002VWNICW|4.0|Good movie, but I prefer the Colin Firth version. I wanted to see the difference between the two. If you like, good for you.
0670014893|4.0|Just a great book!  It is a fast-read and one book you just can't seen to put down!  Strongly recommend it!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|A heartwarming tale about the journey of self discovery and self worth that will leave you with a greater understanding of the frailties of human life, and a deep appreciation for everyone's differences.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|The Jurassic Park movies are all well made and qualify, in my opinion, as classic American films. A true science fiction movie collection can not be complete with these fine films.
0307271080|5.0|Ifemelu spent her early life in Nigeria dreaming of her life in America.  She would not be an &#34;Americanah&#34; like Bisi who came home pretending to no longer understand Yoruba and adding a slurred r.  Central to the dream is her soul mate Obinze at her side.  Somehow his visa is declined and he remained stranded in England, intended as a short stop.<br /><br />Adichie's America is a place of split personality.  A Nigerian denies some of her essence, suppresses other parts, and glorifies another part.  For the author, America is a place that Nigerians may have depression, which she believes is not an issue in Nigeria.  In this book, Ifemelu blogs about her experience as an African living in the States which allows Adichie a clear platform for her view of continued racism in America.  It is written with wit and with and uncanny perception of the small idiosyncrasies of the immigrant experience.  This skilled writing saves the the observations from tedium and allows the intended point to be understood.  The opening scene is Ifemulu needing to travel to a poorer suburb from Princeton in order to have her hair braided.  The scene highlights her new discomfort with some old ways while also showing the African ways she misses.<br /><br />Ifemulu is a complex character often in flux.  She is always observant, and always ready to take responsibility for herself.  Her struggles are not only Nigerian.  Who among us have not wondered why the world is suddenly made for small boned, blonde women when women are &#34;many boned and many colors?&#34;  I especially loved the term many boned.  Obinze, however, caught more unambiguously and the man whose heart is broke, is also less sure footed.  It is heart breaking to see his basic goodness of soul work against him.  Both these characters are fleshed out beautifully, and we are allowed detailed views of the nooks of their characters.<br /><br />Adichie is a lovely writer.  She is able to expand the universality of the human experience while revealing the ways that culture sculpt us into varied forms.  Her prose can run long on occasion, and I think this is a matter of taste.  I like to take a more leisurely walk in a book.  I always appreciate a book's ability to allow me to peek into another Preston's world both specific and general.  I would recommend this book to you.rience while revealing the ways that culture sculpt us into varied forms.  Her prose can run long on occasion, and I think this is a matter of taste.

B001R0O9K4|4.0|This movie does a good job of presenting the Irish Rebellion starting at the end of the Easter rising through the creation of the Irish free state. Liam Neeson does an excellent job of portraying Collins along with good acting by the other cast members. This account of Irish history seems accurate.

Before i had this one i had the free version.<br />The differences are:<br />FREE= YOU CANT SAVE AND YOU HAVE FEW BLOCKS THAT YOU CAN USE<br />PAID= EVERYTHING IS SAVED AND THERE ARE A LOT OF BLOCKS TO CHOOSE FROM<br />i decided to get the paid version so i could make more advanced stuff and know that it would be saved. So far in creative mode i made a house a pond a bridge a garden and a library.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Ok, after reading this entire series, there was no way I was NOT going to pay the inflated price and NOT read this last book. The series as a whole has been phenomenal. But this last book was written in a wierd way - it just didn't feel like all the other books - I think what most readers are also objecting to is that Sookie ends up with SAM! The story doesn't end in the fairy tale romance with Eric that we all wanted. Too bad! But vamps will be vamps. I think the author stayed true to her vision but after 14 books, maybe this last one was a real challenge to write. It was more of a downer for me. I did appreciate the final climax at the end. The sex scenes fell way flat compared to earlier books. Awwww, too bad. Sookie Stackhouse is a very memorable character and I have thoroughly enjoyed all the other books except for the last two, but mostly because the story went in a direction that I didn't like.
B00CBRAD2A|4.0|As an action movie lover I really enjoyed this movie. I would recommend it to anyone who likes Arnold Swartzeneggers' character portrayals.

B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I read the book and watched all of the Lord of the Ring movies so without a doubt I was ready for this movie to come out. I wasn't disappointed in fact I watched a few times already. The price was fare and the delivery was prompt and packaging was sufficent
B00992CF6W|4.0|I Had A chest full of diamonds and iron ingots and returned to main menu and when I came back they were gone!!!!!!!Everything else is fine please fix that glitch.
B008NMT684|5.0|My 20mo. old grandson loves these puzzles. It keeps him busy longer than any other app so far. He loves to clapping after he dose a puzzle correct .
B008602KQI|5.0|I found the movie to be amazing. I hadn't read the books prior to seeing the movie, however it did inspire me to purchase the book trilogy. After reading the first book it was great to realize that important dialogue had been taken directly from the book.
B00304RMFE|5.0|I never have been and seriously doubt that I ever will.<br />That being said, the Halo Universe is without a doubt a most exciting place to visit. I can now understand why this game is so popular.<br />While the graphics are different for each segment, and very much different from Halo 4 and since I am not a gamer and have no idea what, where, who or why, this does explain some of the characters. I am sure that anyone who enjoys such sci-fi will find this enjoyable.
B00ATPVA78|4.0|I just started playing and so far it seems to be a pretty good game. The graphics are great and the puzzles are fun. I would recommend this game.
B008P3SPVU|4.0|Every once in a while, there comes a movie with a meaning. I usually don't watch these types. I want to be entertained not lectured, but this movie, like a couple of others I've watched, doesn't gloss over anything. So many movies made of actual events tend to  be over dramatic or sappy, this isn't one of those.<br />So get out the popcorn, sit back and watch. And listen.
0767812166|5.0|Jeff Bridges did a great job in this film. It was fantastic and it's just as great as i remembered it..
B009NLC1D6|4.0|When this first came out, I didn't go to the theatre. When it won best picture, I was angry, I wanted that other popular one to win. But since then, I have watched it 3 times and each time got something different from it. You don't find very many people today that can inspire a multitude of people from so many different backgrounds and religions like he did. While we all like to think we are tolerant of each other, just turning on the daily news tells you different. Someday, but not today. So if you want to watch what it could be like, watch this movie.
B003YK42M0|5.0|This album is one of my favorites and it sounds even better on vinyl. The sleeve is gorgeous and I'm glad to have it as a part of my collection.
0449013855|5.0|This author's creativity is uncanny. It is so imaginative and unique. I enjoyed all of the photographs and letters. This book is easy to read and so mysterious that it keeps it's reader's attention.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Love the sound effects. Makes me feel like I know what I'm doing. Easy to play, and fun too. Great fun with my grandsons.
1476734941|3.0|A friend of mine was on the IF diet and she was very happy. I did it for 3 weeks and i got kinda sick, so i quite the IF and I'm still have some health issues.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|Sorry but this movie is a disappointment.  Too much foul language and the \\"plot\\" is very confusing. I should've checked the reviews before renting it.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Loved, loved, loved the writing in this cleverly composed book. Raised on cop shows and a diet of Disney I wanted my fairy tale ending, with the villain getting their just desserts. It mostly delivered, despite my initial shock I found I reflected about life in general and found it fairly true to. Despite being denied access to my expectations I totally rate this novel for its smart character construction, the journey the reader goes on with the 'protagonist'( have to use the term loosely, there are no heroes here). Enjoy!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|\\"Star Trek Into Darkness\\" is excellent! This is how the story goes: When the crew of the Enterprise is called back home, they find an unstoppable force of terror from within their own organization has detonated the fleet and everything it stands for, leaving our world in a state of crisis. With a personal score to settle, Captain Kirk leads a manhunt to a war-zone world to capture a one man weapon of mass destruction. As our heroes are propelled into an epic chess game of life and death, love will be challenged, friendships will be torn apart, and sacrifices must be made for the only family Kirk has left: his crew.<br /><br />The cast led by Chris Pine (as Captain James T. Kirk), Zachary Quinto (as Commander Spock), Zoe Saldana (as Lieutenant Uhura), Karl Urban (as Dr. Leonard 'Bones' McCoy), Simon Pegg (as Commander Montgomery 'Scotty' Scott), John Cho (as Lieutenant Hikaru Sulu), Benedict Cumberbatch (as John Harrison), Anton Yelchin (as Ensign Pavel Chekov), Bruce Greenwood (as Admiral Christopher Pike), Peter Weller (as Admiral Marcus) & Alice Eve (Dr. Carol Marcus) is excellent. The directing by J.J. Abrams (who also produced) is excellent. The story & screenplay (based on the TV series created by Gene Roddenberry) by Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman & Damon Lindelof (all three also produced the film, as well) is excellent.<br /><br />The music by Michael Giacchino is excellent. The cinematography by Dan Mindel is excellent. The film editing by Maryann Brandon & Mary Jo Markey is excellent. The casting by April Webster & Alyssa Weisberg is excellent. The production design by Scott Chambliss is excellent. The art direction by Alan Au, Ramsey Avery, Steve Christensen, James Clyne, Kasra Farahani, Natasha Gerasimova, Michael E. Goldman, Andrew Murdock, Harry E. Otto, Lauren E. Polizzi & Jason Baldwin Stewart is excellent. The set decoration by Karen Manthey, set dressings by Rich Andrade, Maxwell Britton, Jack Cornelius, David Ladish, Steven Ladish, Chris Larsen, Michael C. Magno, Merdyce McClaran & Edward J. Protiva, set designs by Lorrie Campbell, Tim Croshaw, Kevin Cross, Robert Fechtman, Tex Kadonaga, Tammy S. Lee, Jeff Markwith, Karl J. Martin, Sam Page, Anne Porter, Andrew Reeder, Scott Schneider, Easton Michael Smith, Randall D. Wilkins & Jane Wuu is excellent. The costume design by Michael Kaplan is excellent. The special make-up effects design by David LeRoy Anderson is excellent. The creature designs by Neville Page are excellent. The special effects coordinated by J.D. Schwalm, supervised by Burt Dalton is excellent. The visual effects coordinated by Maren Dolzmann, Thomas Furukawa, Ali Ingham, Perry Kain, Zhunan Li, Mona Mohr, Trina Renee, Cara Samuels, Marlies Schacherl, Adrian Steel, Yinai Sun, Bill Wang, Shanshan Xie, Sarah Yunrong Yu & Momo Zhan, supervised by Kevin Baillie, David Burton, Simon Carr, Urs Franzen, Ben Grossmann, Jorn Grobhans, Alex Henning, Thomas Lautenbach, Sven Martin, Saku Partamies, Jason Richardson, Patric Roos, Benjamin Seide & Michael Wortmann is excellent. The stunts coordinated by John Stoneham Jr., fights coordinated by Marcus Young is excellent.<br /><br />This is an excellent, well-made and well-crafted (thematically and visually) movie and sequel that is just as entertaining and interesting as its original, possibly better than it. This is also another impressive entry in the Star Trek franchise. Chris Pine & Zachary Quinto, among others, are back, reprising the roles from the original, just as well, possibly, better than the first time. Benedict Cumberbatch's John Harrison is an excellent and well-done villain, right alongside the Star Trek villains of the past. J.J. Abrams has crafted another entertainingly done film that is among one of his best movies of his career, beside the last \\"Star Trek\\" & \\"Super 8\\", also another well-crafted sequel on Abrams' resume, alongside, \\"Star Trek\\" & \\"Mission Impossible III & Ghost Protocol\\". This is one of the best movies of the year, so far, and it is also one of the best movies of the summer season, so far, as well, possibly, the best summer movie yet.
B003O86MY8|5.0|Fantastic arrangements with unusual string accompiment. Great selection of songs both new and old.I listen to this on the way to work at 5am, to get me in gear for the day.

B004XWMXW4|5.0|If one cello is great, the two cellos has to be twice as good, but it is even better than that. Get ready to sit back and have your ears tingle to the great strings. Don't pass this one up.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|You loved the characters and weren't sure who was good or bad about the different characters.  I can't wait to read his next one!
B00992CF6W|5.0|ive had this for one week and I love it.I hope in next update u will be able to detonate Tnt in creative mode. but in the end it is awesome I recommend this game
B00005AWMF|5.0|The Best of Sade Songs are my top 3 of songs I play every day, every car trip and on my drive home from work trips. It is the be therapy I can get which keeps me in love with life, God and songs.
B006ZB3V2C|5.0|This app is the best. I have it on my phone and on my kindle fire. I had helped me sleep many times.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I picked up this book to see what all the fuss was about and I am now dumber for having read it. I forced myself to finish it just to see if it ever actually developed a plot. It didn't. It is just a  bunch of sex scenes which would be great but they are boring, juvenile, contrived, repetitive, and annoying. And now I'm as dumb as our subnormal heroine.<br /><br />Congratulations E.L. James, you are a joke just like your book.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I found the app to be easy and simple to use. I love the frames to choose from. A must have for the kindle Fire. I recommend this product.
0062059963|4.0|I still am reeling from reading this novel and cannot believe I will have to wait a whole year to see this one play out.  I am...saddened by this turn of events.<br /><br />Okay, so I read.  A lot.  And sometimes I read crazy fast.  But, let me tell you, folks.  I read this one in like, 3 hours.<br /><br />It is also not a secret that the prices of ebooks, well, they irritate me.  I have never hidden this fact.  I paid for this one.  Full price.  Eleven bucks.  These facts should tell you something..  Other than that I was too lazy to go to the library.<br /><br />I finished The Selection at 1 in the morning and had to read The Elite like, right then.  So I logged into Barnes and Noble and bought the Nook version.  It is one of very few books I have bought that were above 5 dollars, and to the best of my recollection, it is the ONLY one I have paid more than 10 for.  Because I just don't do that. But for this one, I seriously had to.  This should seriously tell you something.<br /><br />America's wit is refreshing to me in the sea of...  Structure and rigidity that is the world of Maxon's family and the life in the palace.  But the love triangle thing can be a bit frustrating for some readers and I will readily admit that it made me a little edgy.  My heart pounded at the thought that they could be caught and then I started to wonder what in the world this girl was thinking.  She clearly had feelings for both boys and she needs to decide!<br /><br />The cliffhanger ending left me on the edge of my seat and I felt myself ready to scream and yell at the author because I need to know how this is going to play out.  Please, please, please Ms. Cass, I need more book please!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Simply put I am very impressed with the ease of use and speed of download installation.There are so many applications of this type available quite frankly it becomes a little overwhelming trying to make a good decision.The last thing you want to do is to install a problem application on to your device. I Highly recommend this application for kindle fire hd.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I am thankful for my Kindle Fire 5ft Micro USB Cable:  It is very helpful to have on hand when needed.  It is important for working with my computer.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Loved all the action and suspense. Couldn't put the book down read all three in a matter of weeks. Highly recommend
B003CI90MQ|5.0|This is a captivating story about taking better photographs.  The how and why, all rapped up in Kelby's interesting and humorous narratives.  I was genuinely sorry when I finished the last page; it was that captivating!  So, I returned to page one and read it again - three times now.  He is king in kindling a love of photography in this reader.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in taking better photos.<br />Ted Meier
B005HSL626|5.0|awesome!!! just cant waight to play it its the most fun game ever yea!!!and its fun to did I say that just get it stop right now and get it now
B0064MPXFA|2.0|This is a lawyer-soap similar to what I remember from my (relative) youth  They were all the rage at one time.  I tried to remember an example of one, but none of them were impressive enough to leave an imprint, although we all watched them at the time..  Recommendation to guys: pass on this one.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|I guess it's okay, I really didn't understand it ,  It just wasn't the game for me to play at all
B00BHU261S|5.0|If you love Alfred Hitchcock you will love this movie. Very well done movie. I would recommend it to a friend.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I really like It .  I have used it several times already and I was happy with the results I rec'd
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|It seemed a r\rather predictable storyline, but twisted nicely at the ending.  I thoroughly enjoyed Julianna Hough's performance.  A good chick-flick
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is really good but there is no infinite worlds yet but i heard there implementing them. then there are armor and all the good and bad stuff
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|This is the Fahrenheit 451 of our generation- even the Star Squad had it's name correct 4-5-1! Worth the time it takes to read it.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|This is like the best book ever. I read this until so late last night because I was so in to it. I could never put this book down. I really want to know who A is. My new goal is to read all the series.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I am addicted to this intelligent, plot twisting show. The dialogue and characters are fantastic and you can't wait to see what happens next!
6305428387|5.0|very entertaining movie life is too stressful and here is a movie to take the edge off that crappy day
B004ATN5P4|5.0|Great to relive the return of Elvis to a major force in music.  It was a great time.  Nice to have all the versions and outtakes from this event.
B0000YEEGM|5.0|classic movie that a person never really gets tired of watching and  it is a movie that is interesting to show to the younger generation
B00821OX98|5.0|If you never watched this series this will amaze you as it did myself. I couldn't get enough of it, just cant wait for season 3.....
B000FA5TTW|5.0|Strange, but definitely keeps your interest. There were so many twists and turns, I got dizzy keeping up with the main character--Susie Salmon.
B009R659L8|4.0|Reading this book from cover to cover gave me many chills, yet I had to read it cover to cover.  Couldn't put it down.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I am a fan of many puzzle games such as Myst, Syberia, and others so I was looking forward to trying this out. I was not disappointed in the least. While not being overly hard it was definitely challenging; I had to use a couple of hints when I was stuck. This is well worth the money and I would like to take this opportunity to ask the developer to please, please, please hurry up with the second installment so that I may hand over my money to you.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|I liked it better the first time when it was called &#34;Battle Royale&#34;.  However, if you aren't into Japanese horror movies, this was a pretty good alternative.
1564148793|5.0|This is one of the most thorough books on esoteric self defense i have read. It brings together a wide range of material and techniques and makes them understandable and accessible to practitioners. I enjoyed this book immensely and learned a ton. Although i tend to identify more with the path of the Mystic than the occultist, i think in the long run the paths usually merge and both need to have good defenses. I have already used his banishing ritual and found it quite effective, i did not feel comfortable using Hekate so i just substituted the archangels as he suggested.<br /><br />Although the tradition i practice in emphasizes more energetic work, i found his use of more \\"earthy\\" practices in the concoction of self defense via herbs, oils, coffins nails...etc...quite interesting. The author brings integrity to what can be a very shady topic filled with pitfalls and entanglements, i appreciated his emphasis on the need to  \\"take responsibility\\" for the consequences of your actions and be prepared...this is the only way to live and practice esoteric work. I highly recommend.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It starts simply. Your friend sent you something. He has faith that you will figure it out. As the game continues, you become obsessed with the mystery. With every piece you unlock, you understand more and more how important this secret is. You become so obsessed that even your escalating fear of the sounds of the demons whispering to you cannot keep you from unlocking the next piece. Even at the cost of your soul, you MUST know.<br /><br />CANNOT WAIT FOR MORE BY THIS DEVELOPER!
B005MLOKXA|2.0|We were greatly enjoying season one and most of season two of The Good Wife until they began to throw in homosexual activity.  We have had to turn off episodes because we find it offensive.  Season three has begun with more of it.  It is totally un-ncessary to include the activities of gay characters.  It's enough to know that they are gay!  We're undecided whether to continue with season three.  We would rate season one and most of season two with five stars until they ruined it for us!
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Normally, my husband and I enjoy science fiction flicks. The reviews were so good on this that we felt certain we would enjoy the film. We really like the actors too. Well, halfway through we wanted to just stop watching but we kept thinking that the whole thing would make sense at the end so we continued. While it did make a little sense, it was a jumble of weird situations and even more weird characters...weird, even for normally weird sci-fi! We hated the film and wish that we would not have wasted our time or money on this one.
1400069807|5.0|An excellent overview of why processed foods are as they are - full of fat, sugar, salt. The main concern of the giant food companies is not nutrition, but market share. As Michael Pollan said in an interview, our mothers were trying to satisfy us, the food corporations are trying to make us crave more. And even when some within would like to do better by us market forces won't allow them to. So we become obese while they get rich - a thoroughly investigated, well- written, easily understandable outing of the processed food industry.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Good Bible, but not easy to go back and forth between scriptures, unless I just don't know how to use it, which could be the case
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It is the type of book that is difficult to put down. It may keep you up very late at night.
B00AKKTDJY|1.0|didn't like it couldn't get game to ever play right. Sometimes it would freeze and I would just have to close the game. Never completely understood how the game worked. It would not change pictures fast enough either, when doing the various things in the resturant. I just deleted the game from my Kindle HD
B00B5P37IG|2.0|Not what I expected. I would not reccomend. Find something else to download. This word requirement is a drag!!!! Ask my opinion then accept my response at whatever length.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I do love this show. outstanding actors and great storyline. Can't wait for next season to start, and see who is still living at Dowton!
0307474259|4.0|I read this book because I heard a podcast by the author. I first went to Wiki and found a remarkable amount of support for his thesis. So I bought the book.<br /><br />Taubes puts forth essentially the message of the Atkins diet; carbs kill, especially the ones you don't see (high fructose corn syrup.) He really nails it when he essentially rephrases the title question, \\"what influences fat deposition?\\" He does an amazing job of dealing with the seeming truism that calories in-calories out is the only rational model. He does it using a variety of scientific studies and just some good old fashioned dead reckoning. If the so-called thermochemical model is correct, it would be the only regulatory mechanism known that purely depends on human choice. Calories incorporated is probably a better way of considering the issue of consumption and incorporation is a much more complex biological phenomenon that just \\"eating\\". The general model--carbs spike insulin production, insulin production triggers fat deposition--is to me, a chemist, equally compelling. Moreover, as a chemist I don't have any real insight into biochemistry (besides about 20 credits of biochem from 35 years ago), but I do have access to some world-class biochemists. I consulted with them, and they bought Taubes model.<br /><br />As an aside, after the podcast I went on a low carb diet and took off 30 lbs. I then went off it for awhile and put 15 lbs back on. Now that I am done with the book, I am back on the low carb diet (or should we say low-carb consuming lifestyle.) I gotta give up the sweets and not go back. I think Taube is right on this.<br /><br />I went to the other Amazon reviews paying particular attention to those that disagree with my conclusion--in this case the low-star reviews--and found the interesting. Some simply question the pace of the book. No problem there; every book is too long in my opinion. Others challenge Taubes, but they seem to simply be mistaken. They seem to apply criticismto Taubes that is warranted.
0307155102|5.0|Gave this book as a gift and she loved it.  I remember my boys having this book when they were young.

B009R659L8|5.0|As usual read this in just a couple of days.  Her books always make you want to keep reading and sorry when you finish that there isn't more
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|So I got this game for my 4 year old and I ended up loving it. So I ended up getting it on my kindle fire and I really like it but I feel like they trick you because they made it a free app but not long into the game you're spending your own money to buy algae and pearls. I never really had an issue running out of the sand dollars. Overall it's a nice relaxing game but the downfall is spending money because you have to if you want to keep playing.
B003L77FYS|5.0|Good stories are well performed. The chemistry between actors is terrific! I am entertained. This is escapism at it's best!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is absolutely wonderful!! I couldn't put it down. I'm starting on the second one now! Read it, read it, read it!
193700788X|1.0|When I first found out this series was ending it felt like I was losing a very close friend. The journey with Sookie had been a great one up until around book 11, lets be honest book 12 was eh. But I stuck it out. I bought this last installment with high hopes that CH would deliver, well she delivered all right, a big box of horribly written hot mess! I won't go into the same details as other disappointed fans have written but the bottom line is we should all get a refund and compensation for the time we lost in our lives for reading this rushed and terribly written book. What the heck happened CH? You should re-write this book and send it to your fans who bought this garbage for free. Did you get a bonus for getting this book completed in a certain time frame? Bottom line don't waste your money, the Sookie you fell in love with in books 1-12 is not the Sookie in this book, I think the Sookie in those books would beat this Sookie up. And don't even get me started what she did with Eric. What a shame for such an amazing series to end this way.... Awful!
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I thought it was a great movie.  Some of the parts in the movie are a bit unrealistic, but then again so are the comics at times... it's kinda the way super hero's are supposed to be!  Will definitely be buying it someday.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|I was able to set it up and get it running in ten minutes. One downside is that it wasn't working for me in college where Internet is related through LDAP. Another thing is that the response time is considerably slow. It takes me 10 seconds over 3G before the outcome of my action appears again on the phone. I haven't tried other remote desktop utilities so I don't know if it's too slow or not.
1595141715|5.0|This is the best book ever written for teens to get an understanding and an insight on suicide.  My son had to have a book for his 8th Grade AP-English Class.  This book also helped my son and I talk about my daughter's suicide for the first time.  I would recommend this book for ALL teens.  Not only is this book about suicide, but it is about bullying. A MUST READ.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Recommend to all kids who love the Minecraft game and want to create something which they can feel in the real world.
0486266885|5.0|The price on this book was awesome.  My son needed it for school his 8th Grade AP-English.  He wasn't wild about reading this book or the story, but he liked the size of the book.  I  needed this book in two days which I thought was going to be impossible, my son didn't tell me until the last minute he needed it.  I couldn't believe it when it arrived right on time!

B00BJS7104|5.0|A surprising amount of humor takes the edge off the violence and nasty subject matter making this a very watchable movie. Music does not fit the time period but really works in this movie. Rented the movie, then just went ahead and bought it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Wow, for the price this is a great puzzling game.  I got started and then completely became enthralled by the puzzle boxes.  I wish boxes like these existed.  There are great clues available to assist in the trouble spots if you need them, I did twice.  There seems to be a back story behind the mystery of the box and the room it is in.  There is no way that you find yourself in the room by accident.  The background music adds to the effects nicely.  I started and ended up two &quot;chapters&quot; later running out of battery on my Kindle two and a half hours later.<br /><br />I recommend this app/game to anyone who is tired of the same old puzzler games and wants a nice and pleasant Chang of pace.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|i did not know anything about Abraham Lincoln until i read this book it felt like i was there in the place he was. The book was very detailed. I read front page to back page wow this author is amazing.
B0086HGW42|5.0|Great original music/lyrics from a very talented artist.  Reminds me of John Mayer... very similar.  I recommend this album wholeheartedly.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Can't stop watching this show.! It is definitely my new favorite show! Its very original and funny and has a great cast.
B00AEFXV3E|5.0|This was a fantastic movie. I recently saw a local theatrical production of this with my son. I decided to buy this movie so he could get  more detail on what John Merrick's life was like. John Hurt's best performance ever in my opinion. He portrayed the spirit, anguish, happiness and hope of the elephant man to perfection.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|This is a terrific movie.  I wondered how they would ever be able to convert this book into a movie and they did a phenomenal job, giving nothing away , keeping the ending a surprise.  Well done.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This App is a lot of fun but I would like to say that I dislike how you can't use your crafting table and there is no enderman, creepers, and so on. Other than that this app is my favorite one.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|An excellent action crime thriller.  This movie takes place in Pittsburgh, PA.  The plot begins when a man drives into a paring garage<br />across from PNC park.  He proceeds to ready a sniper rifle and appears to kill five people around the area then fleeing in a van.  The police arrive and pending evidence gathered leads them to suspect James Barr, a former US Army sniper.  During his interrogation Barr writes &#34;Get Jack Reacher&#34; on a notepad.  Reacher is a drifter and a former US Army Corps officer.  Yes. a thrilling and exciting movie.  Tom Cruise is an excellent actor.  Movie is great to the end.  I have seen it twice.
0802473156|5.0|Gary D Champman is a great writer, and this book is very interesting! I can apply what's in this book to real life, and use his advice and teachings to make my relationships deeper.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|The information in this book has saved me a huge amount of time! It teaches you how to format a perfect ebook!
0307957837|4.0|I wanted to read the book after I realized the Golden Compass movie wasn't going to finish the series. I do like fantasy a lot, however this was a little darker than I expected. Yet I couldn't stop reading after I finished with the first book.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I love hidden object games, at my age,  they exercise the brain.  I love the magical graphics.  This game is great!
B0026KX5PO|2.0|tired of Hollywood pushing the gay agenda...  this was a wired movie with , as far as I could tell, no redeeming value or point to the plot.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|I loved the songs and have listened to it many, many times. Buble is the best. Can't wait for his next album.
B0018QQQK8|3.0|I really enjoyed this story. Not a huge amount of romance but enough for me. Written get simply. My ten-year-old daughter could read and understand this book. I found it lacking because of this simplistic style of writing.... there was no challenge. But I did enjoy the book overall and would recommend it.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I bought this backpack because its specs weren't far different than those of the Manfrotto V Veloce for 1/3 the cost.  It also had the advantage of having a padded hip belt.  And when I got it I found it also had a chest strap -- another vital feature for backpack.  Another difference is that the pack opens in the traditional manner so you have to lay the padded portion down on the ground when you want access to your gear.  I don't consider this a problem.  Besides, if you are with a buddy, you can have him or her open the back and get something out without having to take the pack off.<br /><br />The padding is as good as the Manfrotto Veloce but is just a bit smaller.  It also lacks the specially designed pocket for a laptop, although I wouldn't want to carry a laptop into the field.  Still, the outer compartment will hold an iPad or similar if you wish.<br /><br />On the whole I am happy with this pack.  It carries my D600, 24-80 VR, 70-300 VR, a 20mm prime and my Sigma 150mm macro lens along with an assortment of filters, a flash, a folding flash bracket, a Manfrotto dual flash holder for macro work, my wireless off camera timer/release and a couple of other small things.  And I still have one unused lens compartment if I want to bring my 50mm prime.  With my gear, there is no room for a spare camera body.<br /><br />BUT.....this pack is really best for shorter people because the padded shoulder pads are not long enough for me at 5 foot 9 inches.  If you adjust the pack so the hip belt carries the main weight of the pack, then you will be choked by the chest strap unless you are quite a bit shorter than I am.  The position of the chest strap is adjustable from short to midget, but I will have to improvise a strap.  Without one, the shoulder straps will tend to slip off and you will be constantly resettling your pack.  An easy enough fix, just know you will have to do it to be comfortable.<br /><br />You can strap a tripod on the side of the pack, but I don't recommend it because it really throws off the balance.  A problem severely aggravated by the lack of a functional chest strap.<br /><br />So, if you are looking for a good pack to lug your photo gear on short hikes or when traveling by car, this is a great value.  But unless you are 5 foot 4 inches, don't expect it to fit real well. Backpackers will understand what I mean.
B0058VW36U|4.0|Pretty decent for my 8 yr old son. Has to use some strategy. Easy to learn how to use. Good as time waster when you forgot to bring something better to do. Not his favorite, but doesn't want me to delete either.
B009MYARIK|5.0|Like her other books, fun reading and a great story.  Great beach read!  Loved the characters and their interaction throughout the story.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|Got for my 8 yr old son to play once and a while but I ended up enjoying it with him. We take turns. Love that there are so many levels and that you can play without wi fi. Great for when you have to sit and wait. Time flies!
B000RUAR5G|5.0|Incredible movie! No hidden political agenda, just good, pure fun!  We need more of Daffy, Buggs and the gang!  I highly recommend this movie!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great writing and a great read! Started reading just to see what all the fuss was about, but found that there is so much more in these books than just sex! Wonderfully developed characters, plot.......everything that makes a great read!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game was just the most fun time consuming horse ever! My daughter has spent so much time on this game that I just had to try it too,best horse game ever.
B00A757EFW|4.0|I wanted to revisit what this was like. I'm still horrible and it is still fun, and I get to show my kid what we had when I was younger. He likes it too.
B00005MK9Y|5.0|If you love reggae and love Bob, this album is essential.  Has the atmosphere more of a religious event.  Well recorded with the band at their peak.  Hypnotic.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|We loved watching this movie with our 4 year old son. He liked it and so did we! We love Pixar movies.
B000002UVX|5.0|Sadly one ever album of this band, but what a great legacy.  A very unique album in every sense.  Almost impossible to imitate that strange hybrid of blues and funk.  A meeting of giants, Buddy Miles and Jimi.  RIP
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|It is almost like grand theft outlandish handshakes Solana Shanghai so saga jansen Susquehanna Managua hahaha Susquehanna Shanghai  subs :/ handshakes jzkajsjsjzsjsksksksjsksksks  shamanism
B00AYM6JFO|5.0|It was a great cd.  Willie Nelson has never made a bad one.  You can always depend on it being a good listen.
B009ZQJVAK|5.0|Amazing actors, a great story line that happens to be true, fabulous music. What more can anyone want?<br />My family and I can watch it many times over. It is that entertaining.
B00BMQDM10|3.0|Not one of her best books, storyline a bit over the top and felt so sorry for poor Lottie, Fliss a silly self centred sister, no<br />wonder her husband left her with interfering in everybody else's lives
B009H5IS1W|5.0|Thank goodness the added character has worked well. It gives to more story lines. The beloved characters are also aging well. The zing and zest of the story lines may not always be top notch when the show was on top but they still excite. I hope it stays that way.
B00CDCIQX6|1.0|I am very surprised that Tom Hanks would allow himself to be involved with such a poorly written screen play that is riddled with profanity and is borderline pornography, this movie should have a mature rating. Don't waste your time or money.
B00C7KYXHW|4.0|I love the story line, I absolutely love the characters. For horror fans this must be your Zenith. Since I'm more of a psychological thriller fan I get my fill almost immediately. The gore is so much more extra!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I was hoping for a game that exercised my problem solving skills and I got it with this game!  The graphics are beautiful.  I'm looking forward to each new chapter.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|I would hive this app five stars,but it takes to much time.Wich can actually can be a problem...But it is great for being free and it is a lot of fun:)
B00CKJTOHO|4.0|The writers definitely did a great job with the script. The characters are well developed and the acting is great. The question that comes to mind as you watch each episode is: how will this all end?!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|For years I'd been told Firefly was amazing but I didn't want to believe it (considering the fact that it was cancelled before it finished its first season. How can it be that amazing?) But it is. With fully rounded characters, great sets and effects without a high budget and such wonderful storytelling that it can have you in tears and then immediate laughter (or vice versa) it qualifies as not only amazing but so much more.<br />I can't wait to rewatch. It is a must-see, but be prepared to be completely caught up in Firefly/Serenity once it's done!
B000002OTL|5.0|So great! It came factory sealed! It is my favorite movie soundtrack and I'm happy it came safe and sound.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I have chills after reading this! I'm an artist who has had to have every odd job to survive, been completely robbed by two husbands, and have a child to worry about. This makes me know that going back to school has been the right choice and I can't to see what the future holds for all of my &#34;crazy ideas&#34;!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is awesome love it have it on computer awesome :D survival craft is stupid its a complete parody of minecraft except stupid D:
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game but way too short...I found it to be challenging but not so impossible. Hints were excellent in progression. next chapter please
B0063IH60K|5.0|One of the easiest games out.  Fun to play.  Fun for the whole family!<br />As card games go, this is one of the best ones out there.  Never gets boring.
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|I wasn't sure if I'd enjoy it. Thought it might be a bit young. But turned out to be a great fantasy read. On to the second book.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I enjoyed this one. Plenty of hog's. As always lots of going back and forth to find/use objects or clues, but I am learning to expect that from this type of game. There is an option for easy or expert, I really like this as it gives me more of a challenge if I can turn off the &quot;shimmer&quot; or &quot;glow&quot; that surrounds the findable objects. The hog's are fun and slightly challenging. You can, and at times may need, to zoom when in the hog mode. The mini games are not that hard and seem fairly common to other games I've played like this. The story line kept the game interesting and would give clues sometimes so you have to pay attention.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love the characters and situations.  The story lines keep you on the edge of your seat.  Can't wait for next series!
B0071T5PN0|5.0|Good stuff.  Van Halen never disappoints!  Great exchange, and I recommend this product to anyone hoping to add some good tunes to their collection.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|although, I find myself reading slowly because I don't want it to end.  A primary appeal is the historical context--an absolutely compelling story line with educational value to boot!  I wouldn't have expected less of Follett!  I am anxiously awaiting Book II.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|This app is generic version of the Weather Channel. Never found them to be very accurate in my area, so I don't use this that much. It does the job they claim, just nothing to say, WOW, am I impressed. Accu Weather is better in my opinion.
1439127700|5.0|Probably one of the BEST books I've read in years. This history book told the story of the relationships between current and former presidents from Hoover through Obama and how the relationships can be so complex. I would highly recommend it to all. Lots of original reporting/storytelling. AMAZING book!! 5 stars
B008K8VDPU|3.0|I got this more as a &#34;to play with&#34; app. It is fine. If you are a real piano player, I am sure you will do more with it. Just a gimmick for me.
B002QCAXOS|4.0|If you don't love creepy movies from the sixties and seventies, then Wicker Man really doesn't stand on it's own as a great film.  But, if you enjoy the strange world of the Thriller/Suspense/Sci-Fi/Horror combination movies of this era, then Wicker Man will not disappoint.  Strange and unreal characters, gratuitous sexuality, beautiful landscapes and creepy children are all part of the winning formula.  Think, \\"Stepped Wives.\\"
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|Cool App! You can make as many books as you want, title them what you want, keeping everything organized. Good tool to have on the Fire.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Affordable and easy to use, doesn't get any metter than  that.  I would definitely buy additional sharpeners to have around for this price.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Good app! I like this over the Weather Channel. Good graphics and info in one touch. Very useful for planning things on the go.
B009IRVSVQ|3.0|I  tracks that I liked were really good. He is not my favorite artist at this time. That may change in the future
B008KYOCA2|4.0|I go this for the Kindle Fire. Took a moment or two to understand full use. So far it seems to work well. Beats searching for scribbled notes for events to do. I am happy with it.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|cool game but it is kinds Aggy cuz for the storm8 when make a name and press submit when you want to change it you can't
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved the book. At the end of the book, they make up and live together forever. It was an amazing story.
B0015AARJI|5.0|this controler is bad ass they are really tough and really durable. these controlers go in for the long haul
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|One of the best movies I've seen in a long time that made a name for itself without big computer generated imagery. Characters that seem likable and true are presented with all of their imperfections.
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|Use it almost as much as the website. Fairly easy to use. Overall nice app especially on a tablet. Good job LinkedIn.
B00AEFZ6V4|5.0|Maybe not many people saw this movie, but I am an avid De Niro fan and when I saw it I knew that I had to have it for my collection. Thanks for making it available.
B004LWZW42|4.0|I wasn't expecting too much with this title, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The characters, the plot, the acting and the music were all great.  This is actually now my favorite X-Men movie!
B003BV8I3Q|5.0|I was so happy to have this movie! I can't tell you how many times I've watched it, thanks for making it available and in such great condition!
B0053FANQS|4.0|This isn't the best of the series, but the return of Dom restored the Fast & Furious series to potential greatness.
0800141601|5.0|I don't think that there is a more handsome and more dignified actor on this planet than Sir Sean.  I am happy to add this to my collection.
B0056BU3I2|5.0|The story is over the top and quite unbelievable, but who cares!  The Rock adds muscle and attitude while the team concept adds a new dimension to a franchise that has reinvented itself and can sustain itself for several more movies.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Love the series!!! Great characters and settings.  Looking forward to reading the whole series.  Why did it take me so long to find this series?
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love it. its the best and every one should get it. I cant believe its free.. how is this free
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I am thoroughly enjoying this book and the whole series.  Martin does an exceptional job creating characters you either really like or really dislike.  There are times I have to stop reading because I am so upset over the deaths of certain characters.  He even creates villains that you actually have pity for, even though you are glad they are dead or you wish they were. Looking forward to starting the next book in the series.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|It was a solid story, with believable characters. To Cruise has done enough movies he knows how to shoot a good fight scene!  Worth a watch...
B001NVIZ3E|5.0|A compelling storyline, endearing characters, this *classic* version of the Robin Hood myth shifts effortlessly between the charismatic Robin's quest to bring justice to the countryside, and his more intimate desire to win Maid Marian's love. This had my children (ages 5-10) laughing out loud and asking to stay up late. Best sword fight ever caught on film.
B00846REIS|2.0|Thought it was 'OK'....but it really was a 50 shades knock off....I'd recommend it if you've got time to kill....but not that good.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I absolutely love this book! I had a hard time putting it down once I began. I can't wait for the final book of the trilogy to be released.
B00BGIBVRG|5.0|Five star, 2 thumbs up, awesome movie rental on Amazon prime. Must see, will watch again. \\"This is 40\\" rent it. Buy it, borrow it.
B00B5HQL50|5.0|This is either #1or #2 bond movie ever. At least top 5!!!!  Javier Bardem is amazing and even Adele's song is the best!!  Love it!!
B000024C7W|5.0|Beautiful music, and more beautiful becomes while You read the book wich inspired it!!!<br />A great message of love and unicity for Mankind, who sorrily don´t pay attention to it.
B00CDXOPYE|4.0|Ibought this for my wife and she really enjoyed it.  It is adaquetely written and acted and should be a big hit to those that enjoy the genre.
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|Really like the price & value on this product.  Definitely worth the $$.  Would recommend this product to anyone. Came on time & in perfect condition.
B009HEMK7Q|5.0|This movie has been on my must-purchase list for a while.  Every fan of the show Homeland should give this movie a view.
B0091VQUB2|4.0|I've seen some great action packed films in my day and this one with clive owens just broke my top ten....there are those action flicks you can watch once in a blue moon for a good thrill...then there are those that you can watch over and over until you memorize the dialogue....and you will tell your pals...oh yah this is the scene where.....well I aint gonna spoil it...
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Keeps me coming back for more.  Love the game and love the new levels. Keep them coming, always anxious to see new games.
B0091W1RY6|5.0|denzel is supurb....story is unique....action is gritty.....I was heartfelt and drawn in by his character especially in the al green moment...great song....a true movie to ponder over with its biblical references...but I always love moves of controversy!!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Nothing compares to Amazon Instant Videos!!!!! Love how we have the next episode the next morning!!! The price is EXCELLANT!!!!
B008PZYRP6|5.0|a total twist in story line takes you from loving the lead and feeling ...&#34;what a tough job Denzel's character must have being undercover...then the twist...glad he's on our side?&#34;...I think not.....any movie that can play with your emotions this much gets 5 stars....and the underdog card is played to a &#34;t&#34;.....in a lot of films you may have seen the underdog overcome things that make you say...&#34;suuuuuuuure he did......and I once caught a fish...thiiiiiiissss biiiiigggggg&#34;.....in this film the underdog is not only lucky and witty....but credible, and this adds to the already awesome action ride....and in the underdogs defense.....you will say &#34;glad he's on our side!!!&#34;
B00899F0G8|5.0|Nothing compares to Amazon Instant Videos!!!!! Love how we have the next episode the next morning!!! The price is EXCELLANT!!!!
B00992CF6W|4.0|Everything is awesome except for one thing what is the point? The only thing this game needs is the Ender Dragon. Oh and one thing if you want a amazing seed type in dum then b o cow.(without the then and there is no spaces anywhere.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Nothing compares to Amazon Instant Videos!!!!! Love how we have the next episode the next morning!!! The price is EXCELLANT!!!!
B0087ZG7PW|5.0|I am a big fan of Hitchcock's movies and The Birds is one of my favorites.  It is the perfect drama/thriller combination.  This movie is definitely one of Hitchcock's best!
B002TWWOHE|5.0|Nothing compares to Amazon Instant Videos!!!!! Love how we have the next episode the next morning!!! The price is EXCELLANT!!!!
B00005JKZV|5.0|A very interesting video, however, it is very long  and will take up most  of ones evening to  view. Good  enough but plan ahead
B00CDXOXB4|5.0|Nothing compares to Amazon Instant Videos!!!!! Love how we have the next episode the next morning!!! The price is EXCELLANT!!!!
B004JK61K0|1.0|I was looking for something with a mass delete this did not have it. Can't blame the program it didn't do what I wanted
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Nothing compares to Amazon Instant Videos!!!!! Love how we have the next episode the next morning!!! The price is EXCELLANT!!!!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|This show has dipped in the ratings, but I enjoy the current shows as much as watching past shows of this series. I enjoy the witty and funny dialog that lightens up the heavy cop procedural drama moments.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I have tried a lot of bingo apps. I erase most of them but Bingo Blitz is a keeper. it is fun to be able to interact with other players and be able to gift or trade items. This is an awesome Game!
B002PEP4C8|5.0|Rape is insidious and far too prevalent. Sebold's willingness to share the deep effects a rape can have on an individual, their family, and community could open anyone's eyes to the far reaching effects of rape. Very powerful and affecting memoir.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Part of the Angry birds family. It is fun to play like all the rest of the angry birds. I like the way they chance up to keep me excited about the games.
B000JMKRKC|3.0|I liked it as a casual read, but I thought it took a long time to get to the ending. A lot like &#34;The Sixth Sense&#34; with Bruce Willis:  I would like to read it again to see what hints I missed throughout the book, but I didn't like it THAT much and not worth the extra effort to do it!
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I have played this for years on my computer now I can take it with me on the go. Being the free app of the day help me in my decicide to download it to my tablet. I love all the dash game NOT being a gamer who love violence these games are prefect for me.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I had just read Lisa Genova's &#34;Left Neglected&#34; and thought it was so well-written and had a kind of Jodi Picoult feel to it- where you're not sure what's going to happen next.  I worried about reading &#34;Still Alice&#34; right after reading &#34;Left Neglected&#34;, if the characters seemed too much alike and just had different names, but they were so totally different- both about brain injury/illness but two totally different stories.  If you want to learn about Alzheimer's disease from an insider's point of view, you'll love this book!
B004TI1WME|5.0|I like this calculator for school because it has all the function I need for math class and graphic design. It is not difficult to use because I understand it.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I found you need friends to collect hearts to get some ponies and your unable to connect to any internet with the kindle sadly. plus the need to spend real money to get the rest of the pony's like Rainbow Dash and Rarity. Not cool. Only good for a week or so
193700788X|2.0|I was disappointed with this last book. I have been a follower the the Sookie books but it seems like she just wanted to end the series.
6304936303|5.0|ONE OF BRUCES BEST MOVIES . IT ALSO PROMPTED ME TO GO OUT AND BUY THE DIE HARD  MOVIES.  My wife and my teenage kids love Bruce Willis movies
B008RA3X5E|3.0|This app does whatever is expected of an alarm clock, with the additional  functionality of multiple alarms and pleasant tones to wake you. However, there little advantage over the free version, because the developers still pepper you with the paid version, just a bit less than the free version. Stick with the free one; don't waste your money.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|new to start trek universe. Really enjoyed the movie, highly recommended for anyone, wanting to get into start trek universe, without reading too much histort
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really enjoyed working through the room.....kept me interested right to the end....and I want more!!!!!  Thanks for the fun....can't wait for the next room....
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft pe  its really fun i can play it forever i cant wait till the next update come
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|So far I'm really enjoying this! I would recommend this to anyone who liked Frontierville (but this is better!). Lots of fun!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|This app is awesome,love messing around with all my pics with this app lots of cool ways to make your pics even better.
B000A1SZ2Y|4.0|Wasn't sure what to expect but considering the price it has been excellent... still intend to save for a Macro lens but this works for me for now...
B00BHMF578|4.0|I like movies based on fact and found this one interesting with lots of action. I would recommend it to others.
B004YXE438|5.0|I love the multiple options:  number of pieces, level of difficulty, and of course the ability to use your own pictures. The pictures in the game are challenging , and remembering to tap to rotate, and slide to exchange pieces keeps your mind on the game. Good fun for any age.
B003Y5SWE4|5.0|If you love Elvis (like I do) then you need to own this video.  It shows Elvis performing to packed auditoriums. Girls screaming. Women going wild as they see their idol on stage. Also shows a lot of backstage footage of him rehearsing and clowning with the guys and girls in his group. Elvis was in great shape when they made this and it shows in his energy and movements on stage. Get this one. You'll love it. I did.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|It was heartwarming, good music, and true story.  Loved it.  Any success for Rodriguez or the filmmakers is well deserved.
B003UESJH4|5.0|Where was I when this movie came out?  I should have seen this then, but in the private study in my home - I watch with much anticipation and hope that indeed he would be successful.  Indeed, the King would be able to speak well to his people and at a time that was hopeful and at a time most needed.  Great!  Wonderful!<br />Speech ... communication is so much a part of our lives.  When one can not hear, or speak well enough - many are put off or make light of it; making jokes or create a stigma that can not be denied.  Self-esteem is unbearably mired in self-neglect and withdrawal from society.  Proving that there is a way around this, that there is HOPE, is the goal and the outcome of this movie and story.  I enjoyed the time listening and watching to this tentalizing tale.  I use to studder but no longer since learning on my own.  I am hearing impaired and have aids to help.  There is always hope for all of us.
B007N8RULO|4.0|like how it so simple to use and how nice it is to be able to change the way the cards are.
B005HED11Y|4.0|The remastered version of this series is of very good quailty. Tried to watch one of these on regular tv and it looked dated. These look grest and the stories do not seem dated at all. A classic that has endured the test of time.
B00AECGQF2|1.0|This app takes forever to load and gets old after you finish cutting and styling all the characters' hair. I don't recommend buying this, it is just a wast of money.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this is an amazing app I love it. works great on the kindel firs I reccomend to anyone with kindel fire or kindel fire hd
B005MHI0QM|5.0|I can see why this is a top selling book. Loved it!!!! I hope this story will be here for centuries to come .:)
B0094GW6YE|4.0|As a lifelong KISS fan, literally, I truly enjoy this record. For the current lineup, it blows Sonic Boom away.<br />However, the vinyl edition sounds just okay. I like the CD v. better.<br /><br />Maybe it wasn't really mastered for vinyl, per se? I don't really feel the 180g does the record justice if it's not mastered for it.<br /><br />That's just me, though.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|I got it very quickly for an awesome price! The quality of the case is great, it's sleek and simple yet sturdy, versatile, and tough :) I am absolutely pleased with it and would recommend this brand to friends :)
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I was very anxious to read the next book in Ms. Collins series. So very often the last book in a series is not as good as the first. Perhaps this book was not, but it still was well written with a satisfying closure to the series.
B0095G5AFU|5.0|I JUST got this app and it is the best app I have found for free hand writing, and school notes. I have been looking also for a sort of substitute for Miscrosoft Word Documents and this is exactly what I was looking for! I especially love the fact you can turn books into PDF Documents!!!!! I love the desperate books and different covers and font and color choices and the price is great! LOVE IT!!!!!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Really enjoyed the book! I read it before seeing the movie and felt by doing so; my enjoyment of the movie was enhanced.
B009LHWEKW|4.0|But they didn't end the show. And, I loved that there was more Felicia Day, lots of cliffhangers and very little Garth. I loved it and I can't wait until the next season begins!
B005D0TETA|5.0|I enjoyed this very much. A great bluray with clean sound and a great hd picture. The band was on top of its game. A nice rework of many classic Yes songs.
B008EEBBIY|5.0|Where have I been lately? This group rocks and I am sure glad  I found this the other night. I can't wait to see them in concert !
B00CRWJ7VC|4.0|Unusual plot a bit confusing even when you know that it should be complicated. Hanks was OK, but some if his makeup was so-so.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Clean, not too bloody and exciting.  It is fun trying to figure out the characters.  A very enjoyable show to watch.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Regrettably, Chris Kyle was recently killed, so this is a painful review.  This is the best of the real-life sniper books, getting into his relationship with his wife, his buddies, as well as the horrors of war in the Middle East.  Great read.
