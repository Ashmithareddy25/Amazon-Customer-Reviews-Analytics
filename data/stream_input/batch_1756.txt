B009CG2YDE|4.0|pretty cool game. you should restart after you loose all the hearts but it restarts you at the beginning of the wave. also it doesn't take full advantage of my screen size there is a cut off part at the top and I hate when that is like that. please fix that
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Different than any novel I've ever read. Absolutely brilliant, intellectually satisfying book.  Full of unexpected connections, wisdom, and humor.  Loved it.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|The pilot was very promising. The rest of the episodes are available on Hulu, and are well worth watching. Entertainment in the finest Superhero fashion.
B005RUUUAI|2.0|These guys can't quite get out of Atlanta.  Seems like the same episode again and again. Move on to something more interesting.
1451696205|5.0|This is such a sentimental story. It is written in an easy-to-read fashion, and is hard to put down once you start it. It will become one of your favorites.
B004VYYA2K|5.0|Liked this really for storage.  Its cool and easy convenient to have around.  I tell you ....the barbie stuff accumulates so fast...yo'll be glad you have this bin.
1416594787|5.0|Beautiful and elegant account for evolution. In this book Dawkins shows brilliant evidence for evolution using numerous examples. This is a must read book!<br /><br />We really need to move forward in life and we are being held back by those who don't think evolution is a fact.<br /><br />\\"Evolution: the Greatest Show on Earth; the Only Game in Town\\"
034580404X|5.0|Loved this series and this box set was very economical and worth ordering it online. I would recommend this to everyone!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Dr. Eben Alexander's Near Death Experience, outlined in the rather commercially entitled 'Proof of Heaven', is a game changer. I would venture a guess that no neurosurgeon or scientist (with perhaps the exception of Dr. Jill Bolte-Taylor) has encountered the NDE and been able to describe it to us from the perspectives of both personal narrative and brain science, and convincingly point to science's fundamental error of attribution: that the soul and spirit arise from the brain.<br /><br />Several times I've spontaneously - no trauma or drugs involved - been to some of the places that Proof of Heaven describes and can relate that my experiences align with Dr. Alexander's. Heaven, for lack of a better word, is out there or rather beside here, and is realer than real, if one is gifted the opportunity to encounter it. Our brain, the five-senses circumscribed experience, is a paltry meter of what actually exists and only our hubris keeps us from the All that IS.<br /><br />It's really great that Dr. Alexander is compelled to suggest how wrong we have all been. Perhaps personal consciousness arises from the brain but that fragment may simply reside in these bodies for a short time, to learn, to choose, and then to return to the gorgeous love of All that IS. (Sorry, I hate to get poetic on you, but it is a transcendent place that the author visited after all.)<br /><br />I loved this book for its affirmation. I appreciate Dr. Alexander for his courage. And I hope that many people draw hope, peace and an expansive sense of love from his experience. Those who are skeptical, well, they simply live up to their own expectations - kind of a universal law - and their own capacity for growth.<br /><br />If one has a problem with the quasi-religious terms that Dr. Alexander uses to describe his experience, we must recall that people in these situations tend to be shown things in a way that they can understand them, which points to a rather benevolent next paradigm. And just for the record, I am an ex-Catholic, irreligious but spiritual nevertheless, and remain skeptical of self-appointed teachers in this realm. [...]religious but spiritual nevertheless, and remain skeptical of self-appointed teachers in this realm. [...]
B00A8ECU24|5.0|fun game for everyone. great game to pass the time. no problems with the game. my kids like it also.
B00913P6G0|5.0|The thought and skill in this CD is at another level.  The storytelling sequencing leads me to believe this artist will help restore rap/hip hop's credibility.  I get a 70's music vibe, intertwined with messages of early rap, but with a unique edge all Kendrick Lamar's.  Dre only comes out when the right artist calls.  I so look forward to more from Kendrick Lamar -- even though this CD has been the only thing in my car since I got it.
B009HNDCC4|5.0|Always something fresh and new with each episode. The writers of this series are amazing. My family should be such fun.
B005LF9IO8|5.0|Who ever thought of this movie did some thinking. This is a great movie, action packed and fast paced. Wish my son had some of these skills.
B008MM9630|3.0|nice game but take awhile to grow some crops. good graphics.  love the animals if it didn't take so mu h for a free tam.
B0038P59A0|5.0|I have realy enjoyed this movie. I have watched it many times and still love it. It is action packed.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|New as described! Absolutely perfect, no problems whatsoever. Arrived quickly as well. One happy customer! Definitely would recommend to a friend.
B0063GORYU|4.0|good app and I like playing it. ads are a bit often but ok.  game doesn't crash like other free ones on the kindle do
B0013F1D02|5.0|This is a great movie for the whole family. Its one of those really great movies to watch with a boyfriend or when your ready to just chillax with a good movie on a rainy day.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I ordered this one for myself. It came in a beautiful packaging and I love it.... Its a great movie to add to your family collection
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is extremely addicting puzzle game for people of all ages that will keep you thinking and it isn't too hard.
B001BR5NH6|5.0|I have seen this movie @ the theatre and would like to have at home . Great movie with plenty of laughs. I will be glad when it arrives.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Excellent series, both entertaining and thought-provoking as the survivors struggle with the new world order, politics, and redefining right and wrong,
B000XUBF3I|5.0|This is the best program there is for overcoming the frustration and anxiety of keeping a house.  This is a very kind and gentle and loving way to learn a better way to keep up with the household tasks.  There is also a great website and podcasts to keep you going,  Marla is a hero to so many women.  Wish I had this earlier in my life, and I hope to impart these habits on my daughter.  LOVE THIS
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is the perfect family game because it has every thing from sports and action to puzzles.I also love this game because it kind of teaches you how to save up money for different games that you might want to buy like more expensive games that are more fun but expensive.
B002F6FQGK|5.0|The best mp3 album I bought this year! I have been playing it non-stop in my car, best purchase ever!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is the better then i thought it would be! its tottaly worth it!! i recommend it for all MLP lovers! dont listen to the bad reviews! yeah!
B008D19WBQ|1.0|Not UNCUT...... N  O  T  U  N  C  U  T.....Warner Bros.....please fix this issue for the best sitcom ever.......we want the uncut version.........no honey, no money.......
B009CG2YDE|4.0|Great game if you love the old shoot 80s shoot em no think games.  Arcade style shooter with an 80s feel.
B001M0HGR2|5.0|an amazing movie,a lot of special effects.... i recommend it to every one....good movie,to spend on the weekend with friends
B00005MP58|5.0|Please, this is the very best Pride & prejudice ever made.  It's a winner at every turn.  I've seen it MANY times & still squirm when they humiliate themselves.  get the popcorn & a blankie... you'll mot regret it
B008KRJWEK|5.0|THIS IS A GREAT GAME,  I RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO EVERYONE. I DON'T HAVE NOT ONE NEGATIVE THING TO ABOUT THIS GAME. ITS FUN FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY. ME &amp; MY HUSBAND PLAY ALL THE TIME TO SEE WHO CAN GET THE FARTHEST.  110% GREAT GAME!!!!!
B00006HAZG|5.0|We have owned this movie & I will say again, it's A movie you can watch & re-watch.  Not feeling well & want to be joyfully entertained.  this is the one
B009GIPDQS|4.0|I'm a huge John Grisham fan but this story has been told before, based on the formula used.  However, it is still eminently readable and I enjoyed it, but there were no surprises for the reader.  Hence only 4 stars.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|omg when I first played this it was a nice fun and cool Minna challange. I gotta tell ya I loved it so much.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This is a fun game. The only problem I have with it is if you use all of your coins they want you to BUY more,  which I find odd. So far I do not understand the Puzzle part of the game either. So if your not in a hurry and let the coins add back up then this games for you.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|A fun mix of matching and avoiding traps. Makes you think not just idle match. Can replay and enjoy as much as first time play. Will play other games by maker.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love this book. Can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy. Great read. Going to buy it now.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great app!  Fun, simple, replenishes new coins often.  Great way to wind down at the end of the day - and since it was a FREE app - how could you lose?
B008QTVNUI|3.0|I've watched the first two episodes so far, and I can't say I'm hooked yet.  I like Claire Danes and Mandy Patinkin, though, so I'll probably watch more episodes... and who knows, maybe I'll be hooked before long.  Decent set-up.  Good show, but I'm still waiting for it to &#34;grab&#34; me.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|This is just another cheap knock off of Minecraft. As was block story. The producers aren't going to create a new Minecraft. They need to forget this and work on something new.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Lots of little games, some more fun than others. Sometimes frustrating because controls aren't veryresponsive. But good fun.  The more you play, the more games you unlock.
B009YU62H2|4.0|Best album since Badmotorfinger. I think that the time off helped them to pull something together that has the sound that first attracted me to them. There is enough that is fresh about this album so that it's not relying on old formulas. It's not hard rocking all the way through but nothing sounds very flat either. Before they broke up I thought there were some songs that they just recorded to get them out there. Some of those songs were hits but I really felt that they didn't have that dynamic raw energy. This album seems to have that power all the way through. They've of course grown as musicians. I've been following them and hoping for this. We should all be happy that they've decided to record a new album.
B0063IH60K|2.0|I would give it another star, but it is not truly free. There are ads. The ads are not hard to skip. The games are easy,too easy. I like to win, but when you win most games it is not like real world cards. It will work until I find a better solitaire like I had on my last Kindle.
B0036S4C6G|4.0|Very easy to read on Kindle although the book had its share of, not to spoil a thing here, untypical content.<br />The story was good, though at times close to Dostoevskyan character tapestry and as such confusing to follow.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|If you liked 24, you will like this one too.  The acting is flawless and the plot keeps you wanting more.
B0078XFYDA|3.0|Nothing new in this book.  He just summarizes much of what we already know about the various sciences.  I would recommend only to someone who has no knowledge at all about science.
B000ECX0QU|3.0|Looking at this Cold War film from a distance of half a century, much of the content and the sentiments seem terribly outdated.  As a piece of filmmaking, TOPAZ certainly has atmosphere, with good use of various locations - even though I suspect the Cuban scenes were filmed elsewhere.  However the film itself I think is about half an hour too long: too much time is spent on needless plot exposition, and there are few thrilling moments.  The two central performances are colorless; this might not necessarily be a fault in itself (some of Hitchcock's other stars gave equally nondescript performances), but attention focuses too much on them and not sufficiently on telling the story.  Hitchcock in a minor key.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book changed how I view most of everything. Paradigm  shifting. I would 100% recommend this book to anyone. Beautifully written, and well executed. I enjoyed this book more than any before.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|I remember the furor surrounding the original release of STAR WARS in the late 1970s, where everyone was exhorted to go and see it, and queues snaked round the blocks of most theaters.  I never actually got to see it, partly because I wasn't really a fan of science fiction, and partly because I felt that it was somehow 'beneath' me.  How wrong I was.  This is an absolutely smashing piece of work, owing a lot to the Saturday morning picture show tradition, coupled with - at the time - revolutionary special effects.  The performances aren't half bad either; I loved watching Guinness and Cushing trying to deliver their lines with straight faces.
B004YF6MHW|5.0|I am a user only, and do not have any relationships with the producers of this program.  So far, it has been quite exciting to find programs like this.....hope you enjoy it as much as I.
B002ZG994U|3.0|When I was growing up, the A-Team always used to be on a Saturday night around tea-time; once the soccer results had been announced, the schedulers believed it was time for a bit of hokum.  Mr. T. became something of a celebrity, not so much for his acting ability, but for what he represented; the kind of macho, Ramboesque figure that seemed appropriate for the Reagan era.  Joe Canahan's remake recreates that world, but adds a knowing an ironic edge; the A-Team still emerge triumphant, but we always know that there's something faintly ludicrous about their exploits.  Liam Neeson makes a good replacement for George Peppard, but the gloriously named Quinton ('Rampage') Jackson cannot match Mr. T.  But then I am of a generation that remembers the 80s original.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I found this book to be a hard one to get into, but by the end, I truely enjoyed it.
B0091QSNEE|5.0|3 year old daughter mezmorized by Dr. Panda. Pretty intuitive game for a couple bucks.  Lot to do and see
B009FZFONO|5.0|Lots of great character development. Great to see so many subplots start to come back together again.  I wonder how they plan on tying the season up.
B007N8RULO|3.0|It is addictive. mostly i play on the bus ride home after work to destress but sometimes while also watching TV.  I'd give it  more stars if I coukd customize it more abd if the ads weren't so frequent.
B000ICLRIE|5.0|Historically accurate, this is not. A good movie? Definitely. You may think Orlando bloom is overblown, but he's solid, and the rest of the cast makes up for any weakness on his part (which I don't think is there).
B0035XVVDY|5.0|I have been wanting to see this movie for a long time. I wasn't disapointed. This is a great thriller.
B00319ECGK|5.0|Not much else can be said here that hasn't already in the hundreds of books about this movie. On one hand, you can enjoy this film purely for the awesome action, the great writing, the amazing choreography, but you can delve as deep as you want into the philosophy and even theology present in the subtext.
B009LK6JS2|3.0|I love this game. the graphics are good the flight simulation is good. but one thing I don't like it the lack of airplanes you get for $1.99. they need to add more planes. maybe commercial planes like airbus or boeing. you could even go as far as helicopters. PLEASE do more updates.***
B000NTPDSW|1.0|The Godfather is quite possibly the second most boring movie of all time, second only to \\"the grapes of wrath.\\" It is absolutely painful to watch. The second and third installments are just more of the same BORING BOGUS B.S. I highly recommend you to just throw this movie out with the trash because lots of trash has a higher value than this movie.
B006TJXZ30|4.0|Only two things I find negative about this app.  First, it takes up a lot of space.  Second, you can't send mail to the spam folder from the app.
B005H29GSI|5.0|Bought this as a birthday present for my 5 year old brother who will be 6 (obviously lol). The package came very quickly which I was impressed with. Also it is the perfect gift for an angry birds lover. So age appropriate as well. I love the fact that he actually has to use his motor skills to set up the scene and I know he will love knocking the pigs over with the slingshot. What boy doesn't love a slingshot?!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Awesome story full of suspended and drama with a awesome cliff hanger for the end of the book so amazing
B008XG1X18|4.0|Early efforts on the Kindle were frustrating but it's been updated and is darn good for my purposes!  I love to Pinterest before sleeping and this makes it easy and toasty under the covers. recommend for all.
B009F1ZYQK|3.0|I have the UMe pressing and it doesn't sound that bad. Although, I bought mine at a local retailer and have just realized I got gouged: $45.98.<br /><br />Side A sounds a bit muffled, side B sounds great, considering it's a picture disk. Of course it could sound better. Anything always could. But it serves the purpose of throwing on some Maiden and enjoying the classic artwork at the same time. It sounds very analog, loads of dynamic range--tons of headroom. It sounds just like listening to these records back in the 80s on a Walkman. Just like it.<br /><br />I would say that the disclaimer about the sound quality is there because of the variances in quality when pressing picture disks (and because they have so much surface noise by nature). That being said, there's a great soundstage and good separation of the instruments, but side A suffers a muffled low end.<br /><br />And never fear: There's surely some HQ black vinyl planned for you to spend your bitties on. But they better not be hot/over-compressed remasters. I want a classic cut from the analog masters, e.g., Steve Hoffman.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I have not even had cable in my home for years but I have made it a point to watch this program
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I really enjoy watching the twilight movies.  It is great to watch them when I want and see things I may have missed the first time I watched the movie.
0316098515|5.0|very good restaurant and, recipe book!<br />someday! i will eat EMP restaurant!!!!!!!!!<br />this book is make me feel so beating!!!
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I always enjoy watching this show and like it better when I can watch it on my time and not worry about missing an episode or parts of the show.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|I'll admit it, I'm a complete and total Christmas fanatic and so find very little to complain about, when it comes to classic Christmas films.  Miracle On 34th Street (1947) is an absolute favorite of mine.  I don't think any film captures the innocence of the Christmas season, like this film does.<br /><br />What a cast....Edmund Gwenn, Maureen O'Hara, John Payne, Natalie Wood, Gene Lockhart, Thelma Ritter and William Frawley, just to name a few.  Gwenn won an Academy Award for his role as, Kris Kringle and he deserved it!<br /><br />If I was going to show one film to someone not fond of Christmas films, this would probably be the one I'd choose, betting I could make a fan of them with one viewing of this classic.<br /><br />I've bought the VHS, the DVD and the Blu-Ray of this film and have never been disappointed.  I even appreciate the colorized version of the film and that's rare for me.<br /><br />Gather the family and introduce a whole new generation to this classic....I bet it won't be the only time you watch this!
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|It was interesting and fun to watch.  However, there were some parts where the characters paused....much too long...  I think the movie could have been shortened by quite a bit.
B008HTQ28K|5.0|The Racketeer is Grisham in his element. The story has twists and turns which leave the reader unable to put the book down. The story revolves around Malcolm, a lawyer who was jailed for a crime he swears he did not commit and was in the process disbarred. The death of a Judge and his (the judge's) lady friend makes Malcolm's life more interesting.<br /><br />He swears he knows how the victims died and is then provided a new identity and protection provided he gives information regarding the crimes. What follows is a very exciting turn of events that will leave readers on the edge of their seats.
B0053O89IS|5.0|As expected the series continues to intrigue and entertain.  I really like being able to watch it at my convenience since I am not always available to watch when it airs.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have read many, many books about neardeath experiences, after-life, etc., but this book is extraordinary!  This is the first book where I could feel the depth of the author's emotions as I read.  Most other books on the subject are sometimes too matter-of-fact, with limited emotion expressed in their experiences.  This book is different, not withstanding the fact that the author is a man who is a surgeon.  His about-face from skepticism to a sure-knowing came through loud and clear.  I could hardly put the book down to cook dinner. I highly recommend this book.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|A definitely different idea on vampire movies and Abraham Lincoln. I found myself watching the entire movie without wanting to fast forward through any parts.  Personally I enjoyed it.
0756404738|5.0|The Kingkiller Chronicle is by far my favorite series.  The Wise Man's Fear in particular builds out on the amazing cultures the Four Corners has to offer, and delves into the darker side of Kvothe.  I've already recommended this series to all of my friends, and I'd recommend it to you as well.
B004EWEX9Y|2.0|Bought this cable to show streaming video off of iPad, but can't get it to show up on TV- only items purchased on iTunes seem to work.
1439560803|5.0|The Kingkiller Chronicle is by far my favorite series.  I was never a big reader as a child, and did all the forced reading college has to offer.  This is the first series I read on my own initiative, by recommendation from a friend at IBM.  The level of immersion and realism in this book is simply amazing.  I try to tell my friends some of the stories from it, but I can't do justice to the works of Mr. Rothfuss.  I just tell them to get the book and take my word for it. :)<br /><br />I've already recommended this series to all of my friends, and I'd recommend it to you as well.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|What an awesome game!! Pretty short. But fun. I just keep playing the same ones over and over again. Wish it were longer for free!!
B007CKLP28|5.0|Absolutely loved reading this.  I was already an atheist when starting the book, but wanted to give my arguments against the fundamentalists a bit more backbone.  Terrific and logical arguments are made in this book.  Also, it gives a few good laughs if you're already an atheist.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Not a dull section in the entire book, it's like being with the seals on the mission. I still don't see what all the fuss was about.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This has saved my butt quite a few times. Fits in my pocket and isn't bulky. I would recommend this to anyone who has and uses a pocket knife often.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is a great simple app i use it frequently. i would highly recomend this to anyone needing a simple calculator.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Ah!!!! I want to read more about Christians side!!!! Such a great book!!! I'm sad I'm sad I finished so quickly :( but still great book
0930289234|5.0|Honestly bought this for my brother for his birthday. I have the hardback version for my personal collection due to being a big fan of Watchmen. Would recommended this copy for those that may not become as big as a fan as I have or a fan that just wants their own copy.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|Adele is the reason at a ripe old age of 65 I still buy music.  This live session at Albert Hall show's what a great performer she really is.  Her raw, powerful voice is on display and it comes through your speakers like a freight train.  If you buy music DVD's this is one to have in your collection.  Turn up the volume, do what you do to get prepared, and enjoy.
B009CG2YDE|5.0|Fun,  nice graphic style, better than most other app games.<br />I got it for free, but would definately have paid if I knew the quality of this game.
B009AZZEU2|4.0|Oh how I've been waiting for this reunion! I bought this album before hearing anything on it because whether I loved it or not, I wanted to support this effort.  Happily, I love what I'm hearing.  The first 3 tracks aren't really doing much for me yet, but everything beyond that is just as stirring as intense as what I've come to expect from my favorite grunge band.  Chris Cornell sounds perfect, and I really feel that he belongs in no other band but this one.  The members of Soundgarden are all on the same creative level, which makes for unique music that is unlike any other.  Can I just say again how elated I am that they reunited?  I can't wait to hear where they go from here.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|all i can say is this is one fine app. ive tried other apps that cost money and didn't do what this app does, if you've read my other reviews then you know. I would recommend this app to everyone.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|The only bad thing is that both this and Fishdom are limited on the Kindle.  Folks, let's have MORE adventures for the Kindle in those 2 games please!  I can't for  more adventures.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|If you're like me, i like gadgets and electronic toys. this is a great app and has many functions. it has been very accurate for me.
B00190OHD6|5.0|This is an amazing love story. It is very sad, but the adventure makes you smile. I bawl my eyes out every time I watch it. Great movie! such a neat story.
0307946711|5.0|I loved this book! Funny, sad, intelligent.... and then they made it into an awful film.<br /><br />Read the book, avoid the film.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Well written, interesting charters, insights and tragedy.  Not magic and mystery, but a Barabara Kingsolver type review of social issues from within a story.
B009CG2YDE|5.0|this game has a beautiful retro look and runs smoothly. it is a quick and addicting game. I definitely recommend for the free download.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|it is a great game win I played it but after I played it a few times it didn't keep my progress and then I opened the app and it showed the video then the screen went black and went to the kindle home screen j tried again and again but nothing. so please tell me how to fix it please.
B008I34YYY|1.0|After reading the reviews of this film, I thought about giving this one a look. Now I completely regret it. Don't get me wrong- I was not expecting a blockbuster and sometimes I enjoy lowbrow stuff like Howard the Duck that's a little off-beat. I should have just stood by it's premise of Nazis living on the moon deciding to start another war to determine if this was a waste of time or not. From the reviews posted here, I was expecting a halfway funny B-movie with some halfway decent special effects, and maybe some social commentary. None of this is true for this film. This movie is a hodgepodge; from the outset it appears like a straight laced action film with Nazis attacking a pair of astronauts on the moon and then when the producers realized how bad this movie really was they added some segments having a Sarah Palin look alike as the president in a desperate move to save the picture. This movie is far from something made by Mel Brooks or a black comedy from the likes of Monty Python. Don't make the same mistake I made. Ask yourself if a movie about Nazis on the moon looking to start another war can actually be good and then think objectively if it could actually be funny. The answer is simple- it's not. Is it really funny- do you recognize anyone who could actually make this work like Jim Carrey or Jack Black? No,of course it's not.
B008AS5UAO|3.0|A new recording of Mozart's operatic masterpiece with this kind of pedigree and casting must be welcomed and treated with respect, especially as it is the first in a planned series of seven recordings of concert performances of major Mozart operas in the Festspielhaus Baden-Baden and in these days of austerity it is rare to find the kind of sponsorship required for such an undertaking. Whereas recordings \\"Don Giovanni\\" were once frequent it is a good while since we had a new one of any real quality and many of us are abashed to confess that we return to the recordings forty, fifty and even sixty years old when we want to hear it.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I find my reaction to it to be very mixed indeed, a response most dictated by some anomalies and peculiarities in the conception, arising not least from the  mismatch between N&eacute;zet-S&eacute;guin's direction and his singers' style. It is immediately apparent in the cleanly articulated overture that, in line with the modern fashion, the Mahler Chamber Orchestra is a reduced band that employs very little vibrato whereas the sopranos, especially Diana Damrau,  all employ fruity vibrato verging on a wobble - perhaps not by choice but more because their voices cannot adapt to the smaller-scale idiom the conductor applies. This is a recording full of incongruities: even while he requires the strings to eschew vibrato, N&eacute;zet-S&eacute;guin frequently employs rubato; the result is more of an etiolated whine than is entirely pleasing. Nor is there isn't much drive or excitement in this performance; I miss the febrile, even hysterical, quality that should characterise the Don's sex-obsession and the outraged responses it generates. \\"Deh vieni\\" is absurdly lugubrious with no spark at all, so slow and restrained that an incipient tremolo intrudes into D'Arcangelo's tone. Conversely, the Champagne Aria is taken so fast - as if the conductor vaguely sensed he needed to take to opportunity to inject some spark in the generally staid proceedings - that the singer can barely get his sizeable voice around the divisions. There is a general atmosphere of carefulness about the reading which is perhaps inevitable in a mere concert performance; it doesn't suggest the spark and brio of a fully staged version.<br /><br />A further oddity: the Don has a much richer, basso-coloured tone than the Leporello who is essentially a light baritone without a hint of the buffo weight desirable in the role - although Pisaroni has a fleet and engaging way with the words and it is a pleasure to hear two Italians make so much of their exchanges, joshing one another idiomatically. We have enjoyed great chocolate-voiced Dons such as Siepi and Ghiaurov in previous celebrated recordings and there is certainly nothing inappropriate about D'Arcangelo's big, black, handsome-brute of a bass to portray the Don's cocksure brutality. Yet for all that I very much appreciate D'Arcangelo's saturnine characterisation, for me the stars of the recording are Villazon and DiDonato.<br /><br />He is the surprise of the recording and a very welcome one, too, not just because we all want to hear such a lovely voice back in form after its vocal crises but also because he offers us something really different and convincing in his Don Ottavio. This is no wimpish pi-boy but an ardent flesh-and-blood lover who persuades us of his determination to defend and avenge the woman he loves. His dark, husky beauty of tone, fine gradations of dynamics and poised, virile top notes are all a delight, while his long-breathed \\"Il mio tesoro\\" may stand comparison for elegance and legato with any predecessor. It is to his Ottavio I shall return as a model of its kind.<br /><br />The shock of Damrau's wobble when she joins Villazon in \\"Soa, sola, in buio loco\\" is really unpleasant. She squeezes and flaps, and the vocal security which marked her 2008 solo Mozart recital album has mutated into a decidedly self-conscious struggle with the notes. Thepower in \\"Or sai\\" is still there but the basic tone is now strident and harsh - qualities accentuated by the beat - and that compromises her ability to make Donna Anna sound poignant and vulnerable; she is simply shrill. In the context of 110 years of recorded Donna Annas she isn't in the running.<br /><br />Mojca Erdmann as Zerlina is similarly unimpressive: a very ordinary, thin-toned, rather charmless singer, again afflicted by an exaggerated vibrato and one who cannot stand comparison with previous exponents such as Freni, Sciutti, Gueden, Seefried et al. Her attempt to interpolate a high C in \\"Vedrai, carino\\" is ill-advised.<br /><br />DiDonato by comparison is so much more agreeable on the ear. She manages the awkward tessitura of Donna Elvira's music which triumphant ease; she is a rich-voiced spitfire in the Schwarzkopf mode. Whether she is the great singer many acclaim her as, I am not sure but she is certainly impressive here.<br /><br />The Masetto is perfectly adequate, the Commendatore somewhat given to - yes, you've guessed it - wobble and a slightly nasal, throttled vocal production - although he has a good low D - which doesn't command and chill in the manner of the most impressive Stone Guests; the final scene doesn't really catch fire.<br /><br />All in all, a mixed bag: an admirable trio of singers in D'Arcangelo, DiDonato and Villazon but otherwise too low-key to stir the blood.ll there but the basic tone is now strident and harsh - qualities accentuated by the beat - and that compromises her ability to make Donna Anna sound poignant and vulnerable; she is simply shrill.

0307454541|3.0|I had heard a lot about the series from Steig Larsson, and was really interested in reading this at first. Perhaps my anticipation disappointed me, however my greatest concern was that it's too wordy, lengthy, and just overall too much development. I like a story that gets to the action, or at least keeps you entertained in the between, but the first 50 pages of this book made me snore. The beginning is a dialogue between two friends, discussing their background including professions and lifestyles, as they meet up after a long time of separation. Larsson does a great job of making you feel like you're right there, but doesn't get good until the middle and towards the end. For 600 pages, I feel like a lot of it could have been left out, or at least consolidated and shorter.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|I like the program however I would like arrow to develope a confedence with his personal status in life.  He should be more dealing with the dual life not being undermind.

0446580848|2.0|I have read almost all of DeMille's books. This one was definitely sub-par. A lot of other reviewers appear to be complaining about Corey's constant sarcasm -- I have no problem with that, but in this book, unlike the other ones, it just didn't seem all that funny. I had only one \\"laugh out loud\\" moment in the entire book.<br /><br />I felt that Paul Brenner, the protagonist of The General's Daughter, should not have been in this book. He was a great protagonist, and I did not like to see him demoted to \\"supporting character\\".<br /><br />Beyond that, the plot was far too predictable.<br /><br />I have no doubt that DeMille wants to milk a profitable and popular character for as long as he can, but I wish he'd give Corey a break and write about someone else for a book or two.

B0047VSW30|3.0|I knew the story behind this movie, but the film did help provide a picture of the setting during the rise of christianity in Alexandria.  It was clear that it wasn't a big budget movie and was a tad on the cheesy side, but still worth the watch.

1476715904|4.0|Life has been hard for Lake and her family since the unexpected death of her father several months ago and moving across the country to her mother's home town was the last thing Lake wanted to do. Things start to look up when she meets her gorgeous new neighbour Will though and there is an immediate attraction between them. It isn't just lust though and after the perfect first date they realise how much they have in common. Their relationship hits a very sudden and unexpected road block a few days later though when a shocking revelation makes it impossible for them to continue seeing each other. That doesn't stop the feelings between them though and when Lake is desperately in need of a friend Will is the only one she can turn to. Can they turn love into friendship or will they both end up with their hearts broken?<br /><br />Slammed is another one of those books that became an overnight sensation when it was self published by author Colleen Hoover, so much so that it has now been picked up by Simon and Schuster. I have to admit that I'm always a little sceptical when I pick up books that are surrounded by so much hype (be that books that are self published or ones published via more traditional routes). I have just been burnt so many times by books that everyone seems to love but that I just don't see what all the fuss is about. I'm happy to say that Slammed has more than earned its reputation though, no it isn't perfect but it is well above average and is an impressive debut. The problems were so minor that I'm not even going to bother mentioning them in my review, I'd much rather talk about the positives and there are plenty of those!<br /><br />I want to start with Lake's family, they have been through hell with the sudden loss of her father but they have managed to stick together and be there to support each other throughout. Like any family they have their arguments and even a few secrets but they are all protective of each other and there is a lot of love between them. I have to give Lake's brother Kel a special mention, the age difference between them is the same as the one between me and my brother and Kel was like a carbon copy of my brother at that age. He was utterly adorable and I loved the interactions between the pair of them. The conversations were very realistic and just made me feel even more connected with the story and the characters. Lake's mother is obviously keeping a big secret from her children and Lake becomes incredibly angry with her because of it. That anger was completely understandable even if her suspicions were incorrect. I have to admit I'd guessed the secret she was keeping but I was desperately hoping my suspicions were wrong and lets just say I was moved to tears when I wasn't.<br /><br />Then you have Will. I don't even know where to start talking about Will except to say that he is pretty much the perfect guy. I developed a major crush on him right alongside Lake! For once we have a hero who isn't the typical bad boy we're seeing so much of these days, Will is in fact a genuinely nice person - he is caring towards is friends, he has put his life on hold to look after his young brother Caulder and he will do anything to help Lake and her family. He smart, fun, a bit of a geek and he loves slam poetry which he is really, really good at (I loved the addition of his poems to the story). It doesn't hurt that he is incredibly good looking but that isn't the most appealing thing about him by a long shot. I loved watching how things developed between him and Lake, if there was ever a relationship I've been routing for it was theirs.<br /><br />Colleen Hoover has perfectly captured the feelings of first love and she makes you live through those emotions again right alongside her characters. The story is one of grief and loss, secrets and betrayal, friendship and hope but above all it is a story that shows that no matter how bad things get life always goes on. It shows that horrible things happen to good people and there is never an easy way to get through them but once you come out the other side things will get better. It will make you appreciate the things you have and feel thankful for your family and friends. Slammed took me on an emotional roller coaster - I fell in love, I had my heart broken, I laughed and I cried but by the end I was left with a huge smile on my face and I can't ask for much more than that from a novel. I can't recommend the story highly enough for YA / new adult contemporary romance fans.o good people and there is never an easy way to get through them but once you come out the other side things will get better.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Wow I had heard from many different people that I should read this trilogy. I wasn't buying it at first then decided tbtry it out. I couldn't put them down and even read the series twice! Great story and script ion and very addicting warning! But worth iy!
B009P5S11G|5.0|I don't know how you guys can dislike this album, it is probably one of her best albums to date.. The way she keeps evolving herself in the music industry makes her special.. She has the ability to sing a Party song to a Powerful ballad, all in ONE album, just to please her fans.. I bought this album because there's something about this woman that amazes me to death, so definitely 5 stars for this album :)

B003VANOFY|5.0|I bought this for gaming and it works perfectly. It is durable. It holds a charge longer than any of my other wireless headsets I've owned. It's wireless so I'm able to walk around. The surround sound works great. Te surround sound actually gives me an advantage when playing certain games.<br />I wish it had a quicker way to turn off the headset. It is a pain to hold the power button down to turn it off. I had to program one of the g buttons to mute all audio so I can quickly hear people talking to me off-computer. Other than that it's everything I wanted in a headset.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love minecraft, but my mom won't let me get it for the PC. I got it and played it. It is awesome, but lacking in some things.<br />First thing is &quot;the Wall&quot;<br />the wall is a light blue wall (or a dark blue wall, if you are underwater) in the pc game, there is a wall, but grass and terrain goes on. whenever I see the wall, I delete the world and think of the pc's minecraft. I think the world should be round.  the 2nd thing is the blocks. there should be all the blocks. I think there should be red stone, water, lava, ect. there needs to be animal spawn eggs too.<br /><br />fix these, and I will rate 5 stars.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|Pentatonix is a vocal band that is changing the game.  Their arrangements are extremely innovative and they use their voices in ways that are light years ahead of traditional a cappella music.  This album is another home run.  My favorites are \\"Carol of the Bells\\" and \\"O Holy Night\\" - easily the best arrangements of these songs that I've ever heard.  I really like \\"O Come, O Come Emmanuel\\", because the bass (Avi) sings the lead, while the baritone (Scott) sings bass.  Also, in \\"The Christmas Song\\", the beat-boxer / vocal percussionist (Kevin) creates a trumpet sound that is pretty incredible.  I could go on and on, but suffice it to say that this is my favorite Christmas album of all time.
B008UG0IS0|5.0|I discovered Hiromi Uehara 上原ひろみ due to a wonderful and inspired jazz version of Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 8, Pathetique. This being the last track on the 2011 album Voice.<br /><br />Move uses the same trio as on Voice, Anthony Jackson on Bass, Simon Phillips on Drums and the relentless Hiromi at the keys.<br /><br />Move is a harder and more complicated album than Voice and Voice is complicated. The production is excellent and crisp, the music is fast and furious. It is only after 5 hardcore jazz stampedes that you get a break with the softer Suite Escapism: Fantasy, part two of a trilogy.<br /><br />Part Three of the trilogy, Suite Escapism: In Between, has a latin swing and rocks.<br /><br />Margarita! touches on the Jazz Funk Fusion Thang and moves. The last track of the album, 11:49 PM is more mellow and funks up at around 9 minutes.<br /><br />My only gripe is that Hiromi needs to show more of the soulful, bluesy, less is more approach, as she touched on with Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 8, Pathetique.<br /><br />Maybe she needs to listen to Irma Thomas and her 2006 album Simply Grand to get what I mean.<br /><br />Still tuff and uncompromising. A Super Talent!!!
B007OWRBJK|5.0|It's a serious, yet fun look at a man, an era, an icon.  If you're a child of the  60's and into Rock this book will keep you turning pages, thirsting for more.  I loved The Who before, but have a new appreciation for Pete Townsend and the rest of the band.
B003YOZNBU|3.0|The movie arrived on time as promised in great condition...after I got it, I remembered that I had seen it before an wasn't really impressed.

B0086700CM|5.0|This game is alsome to me. Some people don't have to have the same opinion as you. Also don't get mad at them is there own opinion. Just like your.
B008YRVW0I|4.0|I enjoy it but I do like the Christmas fishdom better. Mostly it's the music that I prefer in the other fishdom games.
B001HQZJPM|5.0|These movies are like Indiana Jones and the Lethal Weapon movies.  Good old fashioned sit on the edge of your seat pictures to watch.<br /><br />The first was and still is the better of the three but number 2 and 3 keep the idea going and flowing.<br /><br />If you are looking for a fun set of movies to just sit down with the kids  and enjoy a night in, you just can't go past these three.
B000SEFNMS|4.0|This book was a good read! I was intrigued by the main character and wanted to read on. I am confused as to why parts of the book bounced around to random people from random time periods. I wish it had stuck to the main character's story the whole time. Interesting read about an interesting journey
B003XQM2YU|5.0|I never thought anyone could top Kevin Costner's charming, aw-shucks Robin hood but, as always, Russell Crowe does a serious man's Crusader-thief that is intriguing and surprising and satisfying.  Kate Blanchett, as always, is a joy to watch in Scott's imaginative and well executed take on a classic brought up-to-date.  A romantic fav my hubby likes, too.  (And I can't say that about many films, which made this a definite keeper.)
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Great spin on a great favorite! I love it! Lots of fun! I need 8 more words, so here goes!
0345803485|5.0|50 Shades of Grey written by E.L. James, is a controversial piece of art. In my opinion, the novel itself was fantastic. Intriguing, exhilarating and heart pounding are a few adjectives I would use to describe how I felt while reading the book. E.L James did an amazing job at bringing her characters to life. You could really relate to and make a connection with the leading lady, Anastasia Steele. Her quirkiness and lack of coordination made one sympathize with her many embarrassing encounters with the glamorous Christian Grey. This regal man is said to make any female swoon over his god-like features. I personally loved their \\"relationship\\" and found their experiences together very entertaining. The story itself kept me on my toes and captivated my conscious and unconscious thoughts. I have recommended this book to many of my close friends and speak very highly of its contents. I am eager to continue reading the series and can not wait to unravel all the mysteries to why Christian Grey is the way that he is.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham did a wonderful job as usual.  Character development was great, as were the many surprises contained in it. It really kept me guessing, as most of his books do. His research is second to none, another reason he is such a good author.  Personally, I had no idea that there were so many United States Code statutes, and I should have known that.

Crap the only good character from then on was the android!<br />I hated the OLD man and his daughter ( her parentage was NOT a surprise by the way)..<br />Though I have to say the visual effects kept me watching to the end. I would like to know if the Android finds the makers and gets his heart.....
0060555661|5.0|best book for all investor, very useful for individul investors. I love it. There is some diff from diff versions.
B008JGSM6G|2.0|it has isome interesting moments,too few and too far between. It barely kills my boredom. I might delete it soon.
B004SGWYVA|5.0|It has great dub over and great characters which every click is represented awesome storyline that's was going strong why did it end?
0061564893|3.0|1421 by Gavin Menzies is a fun historic read.  Brings up lots of questions and ideas for reseachers.  Although over one hundred pages of footnotes portend to back up the research much of Menzies' findings go unsupported.  I liked reading the book but one must be careful about accepting everything you read.  You need to research well before accepting all, but good story.  Interesting ideas.
B0038P59A0|5.0|Enjoyed the movie a lot.  If you are a fan of action this movie has it along with great comedy
0375507256|1.0|Upon seeing the commercial for the movie version of this book, I was intrigued. I like stories covering different times, it looked like the plots would be connected in an interesting way, that it would be an exciting adventure, and I figured that the book must be quite good since it was worth the money and effort to make it into a movie.  So for Thanksgiving holiday, I decided to read Cloud Atlas.<br /><br />I was horribly disappointed.  This is one of the worst books I've read in years.  The 6 stories are only weakly (pathetically) connected.  The main characters are un-interesting, un-likable, and the plots are boring.  I felt like the author was so proud of his different writing styles for each chapter, and so busy patting himself on the back for this literary accomplishment, that he forgot to include good characters and a worthwhile plot.  The stories were just dull, and it was a chore to read each chapter. In fact, by the halfway point of this book, I was getting quite annoyed that I had wasted my Thanksgiving holiday on this literary nightmare.<br /><br />So, if you are expecting a fun book, full of interesting characters and a clever plot, keep looking.  Maybe I'll still rent the movie when its comes out-  this could be the exception to the rule where the movie version surpasses the book. I can't imagine how it could be much worse.
B003Y5H5F6|4.0|Enjoyed the movie and the fact humans are now the bad guys.  Some CG stuff early on did harm the movie a bit, but the movie is very good overall
B0083GOPSG|3.0|Its an ok movie. The special effects are good, but the story and acting isn't that great. Good rental, won't buy it.
B0098VXE50|4.0|Pretty good and suitable for family viewing. Some nice effects and<br />not predictable ending. I thought it was ok, and young girls love it.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|liked the premise and the actors were good as well. kept me watching the entire time wanting to see the end.
B00457X8BC|5.0|Originally I thought I might read all the Kurt Wallander stories in the order that they were written but that didn't work out.  But as it turns out, it doesn't matter because they are all good.  The Dogs of Riga was very exciting and held my interest to the very last page.  It is incredible how Mankell makes his stories seem so realistic. This one in particular really pushed Kurt Wallander out of his comfort zone and gave us a glimpse of what it's like to put one's self in some very unpredictable situations.
B00028HBKM|5.0|This movie is enlightening. I never knew just how bad Jesus was treated in his final Day before he was Crucified. It's worth watching but it is violent so you may want to watch it with someone close and even not all at once.
B009RI4FRU|2.0|The young boy, one of the main characters, had a terrible speaking voice.  It got harder and harder to listen to him. The acting was wooden.  I like many of the actors in this film and kept hoping it would get better.  It didn't.
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|i thought this was a really well done documentary. Usually i hate documentaries but this one is so inspiring that i recommend it to everyone that i know.
0735619670|5.0|I was required to get two books for a programming course I was taking.  One was the Fowler UML book.  The other was McConnell's book.  What a difference.  Whereas the Fowler book was full of purist, elitist, self-important, artificially-complex, 'ivory-tower' theory, the McConnell book is the very model of useful , real-world, practical knowledge.  When I read a book like McConnell's and see how much he knows and how well he is able to communicate it I don't know whether to be amazed or depressed.  Amazed at what one person can accomplish in their life or depressed in comparing their life to mine.  This book is simply an incredibly broad and diverse collection of every tip and practice that good programmers should have.  If there is one criticism it would be that he could include more code examples.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|It was a very entertaining well written book.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and could not put it down.  One of Grisham's best books.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|So much better than one could hope for. Once I started, I couldn't but it down. On to book two.!!
B008O2T3O0|5.0|I received this last week and cannot quit watching it......................What a great production of this opera!  The film noir look with plenty of shadows and key lighting is very impressive.  The dark story where the anti hero Rigoletto has his film noir moment as he chooses the wrong option and suffers greatly is enhanced by the production values and and the great acting and singing of Leo Nucci as Rigoletto.............the best Rigoletto I have seen or heard.<br /><br />The Duke and Gilda are well sung by Piotr Beczala and Elena Mosuc; however, they do not quite measure up to Pavarotti and Sutherland in the 1971 recording I own, but, hey, who would??  Mosuc really does a good job on the aria \\" Gaultier Malde \\" one of the best melodies Verdi ever wrote.  Particularly impressive in the role of the assassin is Laszlo Polgar who not only sings the part well but looks very menacing as he sort of channels Lon Chaney in London After Midnight.<br /><br />The chorus and orchestra of the Zurich opera house under the direction of Nello Santi are tremendous................the brass section is really loud at the right times as I think it should be..........I hate productions of this opera where the brass is held back........in this one one triple forte is played properly:))<br /><br />If there is ever an opera to show your friends who say they hate opera, this blu-ray of Rigoletto is it!  It is only 2 hours and 6 minutes long, the plot is fun if you enjoy film noir type thrillers, and the music is very accessible: \\" Gaultier Malde \\" , \\"Questa O Quello\\", and \\" La Donna e Mobile \\" are fun tunes that rattle around in your head for a long time.<br /><br />$9.99 for this great blu-ray is the bargain of the year.............highest possible recommendation!
B009CG2YDE|2.0|I wasn't able to use tilt correctly on my Coby Kyros MID 7042 tablet. Its not a case of tilt not working at all, I could get it to move back & forth in a jerky motion if I really worked at it. I found that if I held the tablet parallel to the floor I got the best result but it was still not smooth or receptive enough for gameplay. Even being unable to dodge being fired upon effectively, I was still able to get pretty far along if I killed the ships fast enough. This game has potential, I'd enjoy playing it if the tilt function was calibrated or fixed somehow or they added the option of button type controls. I would much prefer button controls as tilt can make fine movements difficult to achieve. I do like the way the beam works, it fires all the time but the longer you hold it down the bigger blast you get. That makes it easier to kill ships in one try.
B00A6N7BS0|3.0|This movie has a great premise , but falls a little short in the story department. The sex and action sequences are amazing. The script was a little light on plot and the ending left something to be desired.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I listened to it twice in a row and I LOVED it. It made me want to dance.<br />Love Susan and Susan and Donny together!
B008Z9YGEE|1.0|Locked up every few seconds while trying to watch it.  Gave up trying to watch it after about 30 minutes and drove to a Redbox to rent it.  I have rented streamed movies from Amazon in the past without problem, not this time.  It only takes once to screw me out of money though. I will not rent another streamed movie from Amazon.
B009CG2YDE|5.0|Fun to play. Pretty responsive to tilt control on my phone. Great old school graphics. Can't wait to try the next several waves of baddies.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Great book! Very informative. & I love the real life examples so you can put things into perspective. Now if only I could get my husband to read it too!
B008PWUWLC|4.0|I'm always looking for ways to wrap up my kindles - not only do I need something sturdy, but I like to switch things up every so often. In addition, I was looking for a case that I could use with my Fire in the kitchen - something that would stand and not slide all over the place for when I am cooking. So far, I am very pleased with this case.<br /><br />The case is overall pretty sturdy. The Fire fits in well without sliding around in the least. The screen is not obstructed, nor are any of the important bits (charging port, on/off, etc.). When I'm reading, the front of the case folds around completely and tends to give me the overall feel of a smaller hardback book (but without the weight).<br /><br />The rubber sides work well on both wood (I've used it on the table) and on the granite in the kitchen. It doesn't slide easily, though if it gets bumped then that can affect it a little bit. In general, it is pretty stable, and I've used it like that to play games as well.<br /><br />I really like the velcro closure - better than a strap, actually. It seems very solid, and I haven't seen any signs of any excessive wear or tear for the time that I've had it - though Timbuk2 generally makes pretty good gear.<br /><br />All-in-all, I would recommend this for anyone. The colors are a pretty good bet for almost any user, and it certainly stands up to the heavy use it has gotten so far.

0385535147|3.0|Too clever by half for me...the author about lost me before I figured out what was going on in the middle two quarters if the book.
1594484805|5.0|Wow. Just Wow! This book changed how I think and view a lot of things in my life as well as where I'm going. I find myself recommending and/or applying this book on a daily basis.
B0046B3QTG|2.0|I had heard good comments about this movie from a lot of folks, so we watched it.  I was surprised how bad we both thought it was.  With high hopes, we kept watching in anticipation of some redeeming scene to make it all worth it, but that never came.  It was difficult to sit through the whole thing to the end, but we did - regretting the decision.

B008KW43TE|4.0|Cool album,It sounds like spoken word poetry with a beat. Favorite songs are pyramids, monks pink matter and Forrest Gump. It's worth the buy.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|It works well, it is easy to use and reflects what you see on a full sized webpage. almost went with four stars because LinkedIn is not all I thought it would be.
B00A17AD36|5.0|Soulful voice and seductive bests. You can really zone out to this album.<br />Definitely recommend purchasing this album. Very nice.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. At times, I felt like Gaimen was missing a lot things about American culture and pigeon-holing us into a stereo-type, but then I realized that it was mostly spot-on if you consider the populace as a whole. Yes, there will always be exceptions, and that's where characters like Shadow and Sam fit in.<br />The characters were vivid and real, the plot was wonderfully weird/surreal in the way that most Neil Gaimen books are. I still have questions, but it was a great read and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to any of my clever friends.
B008B3GP2A|5.0|My coworker got me hooked on one song and I bought the whole album. Just love it! I listen to it in the car.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|While I absolutely hated to see more of my favorite characters keep going down, the Carol/Daryl story line is reaching epic proportions.  The buildup to the inevitable confrontation between Daryl and Merle has endless possibilities.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|love this game.  tiles are really small though and might be a challenge for older users not able to see small print clearly.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|...and that's saying something.  Favorite characters are lost faster than in Game of Thrones throughout all seasons.  Hard to take as it is, each death is each treated with meaning and contributes to the evolution of the group.
B009VB97EY|4.0|While not any great acting achievements were to be found here, it was fun and kept you drawn in, laughing and giggling all the way.

141659521X|4.0|Vince Flynn is still a one trick pony after all these years with rare departure from his honeyhole of Mitch Rapp adventures.  That said, this is better Rapp than in previous incarnations.  A back to the roots Rapp?  Something like that.  There's much to be said for writing about what you know about, what you love telling, and so it is with 'The Last Man'.  Flynn weaves a convoluted plot with the standard cast of characters ranging from the despot al Quaeda types to the huge ego same-teamers who continually cross swords with Rapp.  The outcome from these encounters is predictable but still enjoyable to a point.<br /><br />Is this a novel that could be made into an enjoyable movie?  I say yes, and with that standard achieved, this makes it one of Flynn's better efforts of late.  Still, not in the same stratosphere with his landmark \\"Term Limits\\" offering of several years ago (which would make a blockbuster movie in my view), 'The Last Man' is good enough to warrant your interest and buying selection.  I was actually moved off dead center as to buying the book myself when Bill O'Reilly gave it a solid thumbs up recommendation on his nightly show on Fox.  An un-paid endorsement of the type coming from O'Reilly was unusual but warranted after having read it.  Perhaps you'll feel the same.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|does exactly what i wanted, allows use of my 3rd generation ipod touch on a stereo that takes first generation ipods. charges and communicates perfectly with device.
B009157BWU|3.0|We didn't finished this movie ... the splitting in bad and good ape groups with the dramatizeing music was getting on my nerves. Oscar started as a baby and was a young monkey in few minutes - for me it looks like he was changing age in different scences ... I have seen better and more thrilling documentations about Chimpanzees. You don't learn a lot about their social structure and about the characters. I couldn't bond with the characters. Making it between non-fiction and fiction didn't worked well.
B00005JM02|5.0|I loved this product and it came very quickly. I would recommend it to anyone with children and even adults will like it.

0547884591|3.0|Though this book is somewhat lengthy and seems to bounce all over the place it's important to realize without this style of delivery it would not have had the transformative effect I think Tim was aiming for. In short this book is something of a mental / philosophical mini boot camp if you permit it to be. Though you learn a few culinary tricks in The 4-Hour Chef, what you also pick up is a pragmatic approach to learn just about anything you set your mind to, at least early on in the reading. Tim's basic theory is that details, conventional wisdom, and structure often serve as obstacles, deterrents, and flat out roadblocks to many otherwise surprisingly attainable goals. For example lets take cooking, as Tim points out in this book, most if not all cookbooks are simply a collection of lists, rigid instructions and steps that need to methodically reproduced using ingredients, tools, appliances, and other items that are typically not found in the average kitchen. These *details, framework, and approach aka conventional wisdom of the culinary world though unintentionally, ultimately creates an environment that sets up the regular individual closer to failure than success. Another example used in the book is language, as it's pointed out in the book, though many people do desire to learn a second language, or quickly pick up on a new language prior to an overseas vacation most programs overwhelm the initially eager students with so many language specific details that frustration and resentment lead to the abandonment of the learning venture. The truth is, it only takes around 1200 or so words to be considered functionally fluent in just about any language and if a person could focus in on the essentials of the language, the rest would eventually fill itself up. In closing, what Tim preaches is something known as \\"The Pareto Principle\\" or the 80-20 rule,, the principle stipulates that roughly 80% of the effects of anything are dictated by 20% of the causes or inputs.<br/><br />One side note, I do get a sense with respects to certain topics discussed that there is an underlying political-worldview bias but filtering that stuff out is easy enough.<br /><br />My only complaint with the book is that though he does go beyond the scope, which can be okay with regards to over delivering, he makes the mistake at least in my opinion, to start introducing topics that seem to test the limits of his premise \\"too much information\\". For example, if we were ever to need to go into survivalist mode where are we supposed to keep all the equipment he recommends? At times he seems to be catering to an urban crowd with limited space where efficiency is of the up-most importance and at others, he is talking about products that are only practical in some sort of romantic fairytale unless you are trained.<br /><br />All the best
B00129H7VS|5.0|Quite an amazing series that really captures the feel of WWII and tells the great story of Easy Company by following them throughout the war.
B002LB13SE|5.0|I really loved this movie,  it is very violent in areas and hard to watch, but I love movies that are suspenseful and keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|One of my favorite versions of this novel, with is attention to detail, fabulous sets and costumes, and impeccable acting. A classic, recreated flawlessly. Blu-ray makes it possible to,see another entire layer of detail in every scene.  Not to be missed!

0861714911|3.0|purchased this based on online reviews..i majored in english and am new to buddhism and i must admit this is not for the novice..it seems to be a good compilation for someone who for example, would like to sit and read a bible kind of thing..it is not easy reading at all..that isnt bad, but just be warned...it reminds me more of a textbook than a slow, easy, comfortable read like thich nhat hanh..again, just my take...
B007X4ECMI|5.0|The film's obvious influences are \\"Escape From New York\\" and \\"Die Hard\\".  If you're not paying attention Maggie Grace pretty much reprises her role in \\"Taken\\" as the President's hostage daughter. Regardless, \\"Lockout\\" has a certain ragged charm of its own almost Cormanesque.  Despite the similarities to other films it has rhythms all of its own.  I think a lot of that can be attributed to the presence of Guy Pearce in the lead role of Snow, a wrongfully disgraced CIA agent in the year 2079.  Pearce seems like the most unlikeliest of action heroes but on sheer attitude he pulls it off.  Snow is as quick with a quip as he is with a gun.  He could go toe-to-toe with John McClane in the wisecrack department.  If you're looking for pure escapist entertainment with a little grist \\"Lockout\\" is the film for you.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I really enjoy this app...it's super exciting and wholly addictive.. Every &#34;B&#34; counts lol..i would definitely recommend it! Go Bingo!!!!
B0079K4WEE|4.0|Say this much for the Brits they sure know how to make great Armageddon movies i.e \\"Twenty Eight Days Later\\" and \\"Shaun of the Dead\\".  \\"Perfect Sense\\" works for the most part but doesn't quite hit it out of the ballpark.  Where it is most successful is in portraying the world breaking down.  Director David MacKenzie probably didn't have the resources of your typical Hollywood disaster pic but he successfully melds scenes of his own creation with news footage to create a society in chaos.  Where the film falls short is in its central conceit of the world falling deeper into the abyss as the passion between the central lovers(Ewan McGregor and Eva Green) intensifies.  Are these events the result of the lovers actions or despite them?  The film, to me, doesn't give a satisfactory answer.  This is no fault of McGregor and Green whose scenes together have a charged eroticism.  Ultimately, though, \\"Perfect Sense\\" is an interesting film that falls short of greatness.
B0083GOPSG|5.0|Original. Realistic in the nature of response to the gaining of abilities. The plot wasn't something new, but the feel of the movie was exceptional.

B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Brave was a really great movie, but I think that it would be scary for young children. I think kids should probably be 9 or 10 before watching this one.
B001NLKT60|4.0|Almost finished with it. As with the first in the series, I think Stieg Larsson got tied up in too many unimportant details, but all-in-all I've enjoyed reading it. I got into this one much easier than Dragon Tattoo.
0345803507|1.0|Originally posted on: [...]    I finished this book a few days ago, but I wasn't sure how to review it. I have mixed feelings about this book. It very much falls in line with the first two books in the series, but the problem is that it is EXACTLY like the first two books.    \\"Fifty Shades Freed,\\" starts a few days after Christian and Ana's wedding. They are honeymooning in Europe, they're in love and all is beautiful. Then they go home and all is beautiful, except that Christian is still Christian. Everything that fans find endearing and tragic about Christian seemed annoying and even down right abusive. I know that it's not easy for people to change, but Christian seemed to become more controlling, more childlike and more ridiculous as the books have gone on. Marriage is a partnership, but no one would ever look at Christian and Ana and say that was a partnership.    Christian is dictatorial, likes to know where Ana is all the times and polices her every move. He gets angry when she goes out with her friends! Without Ana's knowledge, Christian has made up a list of people that are not allowed to see her. He is a walking contradiction, he never wants her to work, and yet he has these grand plans of making her a huge executive. He is immature and downright inappropriate. He shows up at her job whenever he feels like it, just to have a fight. I find that incredibly hard to believe. This is a man who has amassed a fortune. I'm supposed to believe that he doesn't know what proper work place etiquette is?    By the time Ana finally puts her foot down, I was like YES!!!!!!! STICK IT TO HIM! Because it got extremely difficult to read the way he walked all over her, made her choices and basically treated her like a child. He keeps important information from her that ends up risking her life. What the hell is with all the secrets? He claims he's \\"protecting\\" her, but all his actions are in line with an abusive relationship. He wants her \\"all to himself\\" well that's what abusive husbands say as well.    Christian is vile, abusive and domineering. It's so distracting from everything else about the series that was entertaining. Ana, often came off like a golddigger, who was in denial. If Ana were my friend or relative, I'd do all in my power to get her away from him and quickly.     Recommended for people who have read the first two books. Just finish the series and get it over with.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Captivating, a page turner, educating and at the same time so sad.  A real revelation about the French peope who supported the Nazis during WWII and how unjust and inhumane those times were.  Something not to be forgotten!

1594484775|3.0|Juliet, Naked marks my second Hornby book, and while it was enjoyable enough, I liked the first one I had read - About a Boy - more than this. In Juliet, Naked we meet Annie & Duncan a couple who have been together for 15 years, and who reside in a small seaside English town, adequately named Gooleness. Duncan has always been obsessed with Tucker Crowe,  a singer who stopped recording songs and went into 'hiding' many years ago. And while Annie appreciates Crowe's music, she has not yet reached nor wants to reach Duncan's level of obsession. Annie's relationship with Duncan leaves a lot to be desired, and now that she's 39 she invokes on a self reflective trip.<br /><br />A period of self reflection is what Annie & Tucker seem to be going through, with a dosage of guilt thrown in Tucker's conscience. All three main characters regret a phase of their past, or all of it, and are coming to terms on how to handle the aftermaths of past decisions. I did not especially like any of the characters, but thought they were realistic. Duncan's character showed the least growth, and I personally wanted to clap a pair of drums on his ears to wake him up from his stupor.<br /><br />Peppered with some witty dialogue, and writing that's engaging, it wasn't hard to read this book and for that I'm giving it 3 stars.<br /><br />**SPOILERS**<br /><br />Right, so from the very beginning it's apparent that Annie & Duncan are not fit for each other and yes, a lot of couples go through a phase where they hate each other (as Annie points out), but in this case, the hatred Annie feels stems from bigger issues (Duncan not wanting kids, for example) that can overshadow everything else. She has probably known for a long time that they don't quite click together, but stuck it out.<br /><br />Duncan came across as very annoying, very lazy, very complacent and ho hum about everything except Tucker Crowe. People are obsessed about things, and will always be obsessed about things, but Duncan judges every one else through his obsession. When Annie wrote that scathing review, he started doubting how well he knew her, for example. He distances himself from other instructors at the college because he perceives himself a cut above the rest since he knows so much about Tucker. He cheats on Annie, but doesn't really feel any guilt. Just a sense of slight annoyance that his life would change from what it was.<br /><br />Tucker's self reflection on how he wasted so many years and so much time was interesting to read. His lack of parenting skills and acknowledgement of that showed internal growth in his personality, but there was no reaction to that knowledge. It was like his thought process went from \\"Oh, I'm a horrible father\\" to \\"Well, who cares, no matter what I do it won't make a difference, so let me just go on as usual\\".<br /><br />**END of SPOILERS**very one else through his obsession.

B000000WF0|5.0|There is something of an older era like the Rolling Stones and a modern edgy thinking mans U2 type of music. At the same time a fresh new sound.  Bitter Sweet Symphony is a great example and I bought the album for that song alone, a masterpiece.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|Love every season of The Walking Dead!<br />Even though the Limited Ed was pricey, love the zombie head-so I can't complain.<br />Can't wait for Season 3 to be available on DVD or Bluray & hoping that a combined pack will be available.<br />The special effects are just awesome, AMC is really doing some amazing stuff.
B003ASLJRW|5.0|This is one of my favorites along side Good, Bad and the Ugly. A must watch for Eastwood fans. The back ground story of a previous brush with the deputies hinted at all the way through is clever film making. Steady and fearless he attracts the down trodden who need a hero.

0449002128|4.0|I just read The Fallen Angel - my first Gabriel Allon book, and the twelfth and latest in the series - and was so impressed that I decided to read the full series starting with The Kill Artist, the first book in the series. The Kill Artist was not as polished The Fallen Angel, but is, nevertheless, a good read for those who enjoy spy thrillers with lots of twists and turns. I look forward to getting my hands on The English Assassin, the second book in the series. A solid four star novel.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a wonderful  life story of the how families of that time loved, hated, rejoiced, kept secrets,fell in love and survived war, not much different than today. I loved every character..good and bad. Can't wait for Season 3. Please keep doing these terrific Masterpiece movies just like Downton Abbey. They are a gift.

B009HQ9UHC|5.0|It is an angry birds game from a pigs point of view. You have to get the pigs to safety by building vehicles. You have to use your imagination. It is a good game for people who are creative and open minded. If  you are not creative they have a manual who gives you some ideas.I recommend it.
B0098VXN2Y|3.0|Enjoyed the movie. Not my favorite Jennifer Lopez movie. Funny in a lot of scenes....good rental movie. Enjoyed Chris Rock
B001FAZYOQ|5.0|Bowie at his rock and roll best! Powerful guitar work from the late,great Mick Ronson! People were talking about this show for months afterward! Highly recommend to all Bowie fans!  MTG
B004I744AS|5.0|great app if you like to learn and read this is the key to Knowledge. A dictionary is vital to a vast vocabulary.  Thanks Farlex...
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I thought i would hate this movie but really enjoyed it! Would definitely check it out on a care free Friday or Saturday night.
B009CG2YDE|4.0|this game has simple gameplay for some old school arcade fun. thus is a great casual game. nice faotd. worth a quick play when you have 5 min
B000FC11A6|3.0|. . . that doesn't go very far.  Still, it's thoughtful, with a little action and a lot of surreality.  I was glad I read it, and just as glad it was over with.  If you like your math difficult and your encryption obtuse, you need this book.  For the rest of us, this book is a long, challenging read, so clear a spot on your nightstand -- it'll be there a while.
B00A6N8F4Y|3.0|Little bit hokey movie with a very hokey ending. Three stars because the blond is pretty. Rent it don't buy it.
B005LAIHSQ|3.0|The movie & plot was good. I only wish that the studios wouldn't film in such dark settings. I find it difficult to distinguish the characters from the dark settings.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|A co-worker got me Grahame-Smith's book and I started it with a resigned skepticism; how good could it be? It was GREAT! OMG! Knowing full well that Grahame-Smith was also responsible for &#34;Pride and Prejudice and Zombies,&#34; I read &#34;Abraham Lincoln&#34; with tongue firmly planted in cheek. He managed to blend with some skill actual historical facts with fantastical fiction. The movie itself, like most transcriptions from a literary source, pared down a LOT of the story in the interest of a clear and focused plotline. The characters are predictably superficial, the storyline absurd, and the final conflict replete with amazing effects and no shred of reality. And as long as you don't expect any more than that from this movie, you will love it, too. For sheer entertainment escapsism, &#34;Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter&#34; is the movie for you.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Another in the great batman sequels.<br />Lots of Action, suspense and great batman devices.<br />Again set in dark surroundings. I don' know if the directors think that this adds suspense.<br />The movie was great but my big complaint is that it Akers it difficult to see the characters in their dark settings.
B0073LWEXK|2.0|I cannot get past the first few introduction screens, the App closes out. This is even after a reboot. Although the app was inexpensive to purchase, it's a disappointment.
B000NQRE1E|2.0|Titanic is a Classic movie.<br />I however did not see a any difference from the original standard definition movie.<br />You should be able to see a recognizable difference in the Blu-Ray version.<br />I think that the studios are in too big of a hurry to pull more $$$$ in on previously released<br />movies without any additional effort on their part.<br /><br />Reselling movies that were photographed in standard definition by putting them in a Blue Box and only recreating the menus DOES NOT MAKE IT A HIGH DEFINITION MOVIE. If it was shot in standard definition with standard everyday cameras then it will forever be in standard definition.  It is possible to make the colors more saturated but the definition won't change.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Had a lot of fun until I had finished all the puzzles. Now I can't collect Dozer Dollars, I'd have to buy them. The game becomes pointless once you get good at it. How about an update, GameCircus? We need more levels and new puzzles.
B0012NVGHU|3.0|A few great songs, the rest was fair --  the story line was cliche, really better to just listen to the sound track and skip the rest.
B009LL4LMM|5.0|Love it.  It is easy, a fun little game. Makes me laugh. Needs some new levels added but even after you get through all the levels it is fun to go back and try to beat your best scores. Don't forget to pet your Jelly!!
B0071MQBX0|5.0|The best version of the &#34;Phantom&#34; I've seen!  Huge production, the casting of characters and especially the singing - you hope it goes on and on.  It gives justice to Webbers beautiful musical.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|SUMMARY:may contain many spoils<br /><br />  Carter and Sadie Kane learn that they have to save the world by beating the god Set.Now that Set has built the Red Pyramid,his power is increasing more by the second.<br />  During the adventure,they meet many friends that will help them on their way.On the contrary,they also meet many scary monters that try to stop them from beating Set.<br /><br />  CHARACTERS:<br /><br />Carter Kane: is 14 years old; brother of Sadie Kane<br />Sadie Kane: 12 years old; was born in London<br />Julius Kane: Carter and Sadie Kanes dad<br />Amos Kane: Carter and Sadie Kanes uncle; 2nd most powerful magician<br /><br />Iskander: an old magician<br />Michael Desjadins: most powerful magician<br />Zia Rashid: belongs to the House of Life; is Carter Kanes crush<br /><br />Bast: goddess of cats; Sadie Kanes cat muffin is Basts host<br />Horus: god of war; host is Carter Kane<br />Isis: goddess of magic; host id Sadie Kane<br />Set: god of chaos<br />Nut: goddess of the sky<br />Geb: god ofthe earth<br />Osiris: god of the Underworld<br />Anubis: god of the dead<br />Nephythis: Sets wife<br />Serqet: goddess of scorpions<br />Sekhmet: goddess of lions<br />Ra: god of the sun<br />Thoth: god of wisdom<br /><br />I hope you'll  enjoy this book as much as did.I would recommend this book for people who like Egyptian mythology, adventure, and drama.
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|Enjoyed the all star cast and the fun. It kept moving and portrayed each action star from their movies with a touch of each character.
B000FC1LOC|5.0|It really makes you think...but parts made me angry.  I did not like the end.  But, how far does one go.  It had twists and overall was a great book to read and a good discussion book as well.
B0087YYHZU|5.0|This is my favorite movie! It reminds me of my youth growing up. Very enjoyable and a movie the whole family can enjoy!
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Was expecting something different but ended up being pleasantly surprised.  For the Science Fiction freak like me. A must see for the Alien Lovers.
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|I loved every single song...Rihanna never disappoints...this is one of her best cd's! She's got a little dub step (I think that's what its called), some slow jams, and more...amazing cd!
0793927501|5.0|Anthony Hopkins....WOW...Great outdoor adventure! Just in case anyone's interested the book he used in the movie (survival in the wilds) does not exist. It was just a movie prop..I know, I wanted a copy of it too...lol.
B000P407K4|5.0|This is a &#34;one-in-a-million&#34; film that comes way too close to the truth of the 1950s SAC 15 minute alerts.
B00A17AD36|4.0|When I first bought this album and saw there were 30 songs I thought two things 1) that's a great deal for the price 2) are all the songs going to sound the same. Thankfully number 2 is not true each song sounds different from the others distinctively and by there being 30 songs I found a lot of favorites Loft music, Birds pt1, House of balloons, wicked games, and a couple more. So if you heard the weekend on a drake or wiz khalifa's song or came across him by accident I suggest buying this album because it does not disappoint, and the coolest thing about the weekend is that he is like a combo of trey songz, r Kelly, Michael Jackson, so many artist elements but he creates his own unique distinctive style and he does it well!
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|What a great movie! The kids loved it, as did I. It's one you watch again and again. I recommend it for anyone's movie collection.
B005CWRB44|5.0|I had one of these I purchased locally and knew I may need an extra one. Great light for the price. The first one cost almost twice as much as Amazon.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|Loved every minute of the movie and even watched it more than twice. A suitable movie for the kids of all ages.
B00973902K|1.0|Why did you recommend this song to me?  Have you learned nothing of my taste from my browsing history?  When this song comes on I have to listen to at least 3 other earworm songs to clear my head.  But there is a great Cookie Monster cover [...]
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Enjoyed this book a lot as it gave great insight to the life of a navy seal.  I felt the author lacked a little passion but I'm sure that is because he does this job every day.  This didn't take anything away from the book as it was very exciting to hear the author describe the final killing of osama bin laden! A must read!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|5yr old grandson downloaded by self and enjoys playing. Easy to navigate and grea value. All kids will love piggies
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Easy to down load.  Have not had a warning yet so not aware how this would work.  Found out about this item when I went into the the question and answer page.
0316044695|5.0|Reads like fiction, would highly recommend.<br />Liked it much better than Seal Team Six.<br />A hard book to put down.
B0076DCT2G|1.0|I have read the fist 30% of this book and am bored senseless because nothing at all has happened. I have read and loved many DeMille books including all of the John Corey novels, but The Panther is terribly disappointing. If you were to edit out Corey's wisecracks (which worked well in previous books) you'd be left with what feels like about 10% of the content. It seems many other reviewers have observed an overabundance of wisecracks and dearth of action, so i am moving on to something else.
B0027WGWQ0|5.0|This movie was awesome, just to see how corrupt people can be.  I highly recommend this flick! You should buy this movie.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|I don't think I can add any more to the splendid reviews of this movie, but I loved it from the very beginning to the end.  I felt as if I were witnessing a Norman Rockwell series of paintings come alive.  The photography, acting, direction, casting, musical score and story were wonderful. I would give it best movie of the year.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Love this app. Very easy to use. Only complaint is it seems to have trouble syncing when I first open it. Always says &quot;sync failed.&quot; But when I tap the refresh button manually, it refreshes and works fine.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I like how this volume picks up and proceeds where the first book ended. I also appreciated the time spent going into detail regarding the consequences of Katniss' win and method of winning. Just riveting!
B000GWE44U|4.0|i watched 'the shining' on my computer and it was really fun.  it's an awesome movie and it loaded pretty quickly.  there was one point about halfway where the movie had to stop and load, but it didn't take long.  i plan on renting movies on amazon again
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely loved this story and the quality of writing that Suzanne delivers! So thought provoking and at the same time, a light enough read that I could enjoy it right before bed time. GREAT story!
B009HV2JT8|3.0|It was alright if you have nothing better to do. Lincoln killed hundreds of thousands so a few vampires were probably no big deal..
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I actually enjoyed this last book in the series. I think it brought a decent closure.  For everybody that hated the ending, if it's so bad and you think you can do better, you write a book that holds people's attention for extended periods of time.  Seems that the ending is usually the hardest part of any story, to nail down to everybody's satisfaction. Myself, I loved this series from beginning to end.
B0098VXE50|4.0|Not Academy Award material but definitely entertaining. Great soundtrack as well. If you want to kill a few hours this isn't a bad way to do it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great book. Easy, quick read of fascinating subject. Much respect to these brave men!  The author does a great job capturing the dedication these men have for their brothers and country.
B007UWBQEU|5.0|I'm a big fan of all Carrie's cd's.  However, this is one of her best so far, should receive a Grammy for Best Country album
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|Great DVD! Great performance by Celine.  I'm a fan of Celine, so my rating is expectedly high. Quality of DVD was very good.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I wasn't sure about this book, but didn't take long and I didn't want to put it down. Just hope the next part is as good as this was.
B009P5S11G|5.0|Rihanna is my heart!! I can listen to her any day and any time!! #RihannaNavy #UnApologetic Look out for the David Guetta track, itz hot!!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|This is a new &#34;classic&#34;.  I already own one copy and this one is going to my train-obsessed 2 year old grandson.  He's going to love it!
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I think it is a really good game.  personally, I like free-roam games and this is awesome.  you don't really have to spend much money either.
B009VB7QQA|2.0|I'm probably the wrong person to review this. It was my husband's pick for a Thanksgiving movie. I should have given in to food coma and not bothered myself with this movie. I like action movies and martial arts but  I'm not a vampire movie kinda gal. I do like cheesy movies and have always appreciated Abe Lincoln. On the other hand, I hate being scared and I especially hate effects that are absolutely impossible. Was this supposed to be like the &#34;true&#34; telling of a legend or an excuse to kill vampires? I also really hate it when someone has the super human power to hold a train tressel together while a train is going over it but gets injured in a fight. Let's be consistent here. Whatever. I'm not waiting any more time on this. If you feel like wasting a couple hours of your life, if you will have no peace until you see vampires die on your television at the hands of an American president, then watch this movie.
B005HSL626|5.0|it is a good time waster I love to unlock swords and back grounds. I am glad it is free because its worth money I love free apps.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|Well written and great acting, Hugh Jackman was excellent in his acting and the over all theme of the movie was great.
B00992CF6W|4.0|What I think is that it needs to be upgraded badly. And I try multiplayer, but it doesn't work. Fix these, and I'll give 5 stars.
B00A2GQT5C|2.0|This latest hits collection from Whitney Houston really misfires on several fronts (and this is strictly the fault of the record label and not Whitney). I Will Always Love You: The Best of Whitney Houston is missing some biggies (It's Not Right But It's Okay, I Learned From The Best, Step By Step, My Heart Is Calling, Miracle, Run To You, I Belong To You, For The Love Of You, My Name Is Not Susan, Same Script Different Cast, One Of Those Days, etc). I realize that many will call these minor hits, but they are essential parts of Whitney's catalog and had decent runs on the R&B charts. The hits represented on this cd, while all gems, are probably in any true Whitney fan's collection already. As for the sole new offerings, I like the R. Kelly duet on I Look To You but I could do without Never Give Up (Jermaine Dupri is beyond annoying and doesn't need to \\"rap/vocalize\\" on every track he produces). This collection, as a single disc, may be ideal for the casual buyer but doesn't offer much incentive for the die-hards. I'm a true fan, and I own everything this lady has put out on cd and have looked online for rare B-sides and live offerings. RCA should have included tracks such as Feels So Good, Dancing On The Smooth Edge, Memories, Higher Love, etc. for those who can't shell out for import versions of her classic albums and also look at releasing a compilation of Whitney's best live performances (this disc should also include rarities and non-singles such as her version of So Amazing by Luther Vandross on the 99 Soul Train Awards, Get It Back, the Heartbreak Hotel live version with the Jacksons verses, Why Does It Hurt So Bad from the MTV awards, One Moment In Time from the Grammys, and any live performances of the hits from IYBT, Whitney and Whitney Houston. It is truly sad that \\"The Voice\\" never had a live album released during her vocal prime and DVD/Blu Ray releases of any concerts would also be essential. Whitney, we will always love you, and you deserve better thanthis collection.
B0044WUQ3G|2.0|just not very good acting really, seemed to be very low budget and pretty unbelievable as far as the plot
B009LK6JS2|5.0|This game is about as real as you can get without really being in a jet. Wonderful experience and easy to play.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Lee Child keeps the Reacher franchise moving.  Well written and true to the characters.  A counter terrorism one man band.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I wanted to read more about Gideon and Eva ,can't wait until the third book comes out in may 2013
B009DCOU9S|4.0|The graphics are beautiful. I really enjoy hidden object games and this is a good one with a cute story line. I am 30% done and enjoying the game.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I was a little disappointed in the first book, I thought it was a little too much like Shades of Grey, but this second one was better,took different twists, and a completely different turn. I was surprised and happy but there are still many unanswered questions so I cannot wait till the third one.
B009XY97VC|5.0|This is another great album that Two Steps From Hell has graced us with.  Unlike other artists in choral/instrumental music who seem to fall into habits or recycle sets of notes or themes because they run out of ideas, TSFH never does... It's always something new and always something incredible.
B004EWFUQY|5.0|This diet REALLY works and weight will stay off with a little concious effort.  You feel so much better when on the diet.  If you slip up - just start again - it WILL work.  I have tried them all and this diet just seemed easier and more healthy (low fat)
B009329ZF2|1.0|Not much real substance or originality in this 'film'.<br />Great special effects (and perhaps worth watching it for free for that alone) but it just feels like a long winded fantasy commercial for the US Navy.<br />Big surprise, the rough 'makes his own rules' Lt who also is in love with the Admiral's daughter ends of saving the world.  Blah...<br />Oh, and not once did someone say, \\"You sank my Battleship!\\"  I might have given an extra star just for that! heh
B00005B1EX|5.0|Great Album
B0020M99LC|5.0|The new Bond is reimagined as a real tough, driven, and skilled fighter rather than just the smooth gadget carrying playboy.<br />The old Bond movies still hold a special place in my youth and heart.<br />I don't consider this better or worse, just different (and I dig it!).
B00005Y0S5|5.0|Great Album
B0094BB4TW|4.0|As all Facebook apps seem to be, this also has some bugs, but it is very usable.  Good enough for now.
B000JJRIP2|5.0|Great Album
B006YC74E8|3.0|It is good for using the camera on the Kindle Fire HD. I haven't used the editing features since the camera really isn't great quality.
B0041CGOZS|5.0|Great Album
B008K6HN8I|4.0|Allows me to organize and download files. It makes things looks like a windows file organizer. Very easy to use.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Nice game but would be better if they added more puzzles after you finish the ones that are there.  Once they are filled in, there is no more challenge except to get more and more prizes and coins.  Great time waster as you really don't have to think much when playing.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|Even though it's on an obscure network, this is a GREAT show for the action oriented; don't miss this.  The story line is crisp and the acting good.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This one is really fun and challenging, the birds now do new things to kill the pigs.  Soon as I saw it I bought it, worth the money.  May the force be with you.
B002N9MK8G|5.0|Great sound, great reproduction, felt like I was at a live performance. Brought back fine memories of sounds of the big bands and singers like Sinatra, the Rat Pack etc.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|EPIC movie!! The special features are awesome and very funny. Can't wait to get phase one with all the movies together. I love amazon even more for giving the option of getting this movie for free due to the delay of getting phase one.
1449410243|5.0|Oats is the best and this is more of his awesome. His comics crack me up so hard I laugh and snarf out loud! This is the 2nd book I've bought. Support The Oatmeal and buy this book!!
B000A3XY9Q|5.0|I got this for my husband which is an evil dead fan and loves it! Great buy and recommended for any horror fan as well.
B004V73FGE|5.0|I Don't have 21 words to say about this! I like it and it all worked as it should. great!
B00340LM8C|4.0|This great movie was filmed with VistaVision, having a 1:85:1 aspect ratio. If you get this movie over Instant Video, it's cropped to fit a standard 16:9 television. This means that you don't see the movie as Alfred Hitchcock filmed it, because 22% of the picture has been discarded to make it fit your TV.<br /><br />There's nothing in the description to warn you of this, and no digital option for a letterbox version. If you don't care about getting the entire picture (a lot of people won't), then it's ok to rent it digitally. However, if you want to see this classic movie as it was originally filmed, you should get the Blu-Ray version.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|I Don't have 21 words to say about this! I like it and it all worked as it should. great!
1416589473|5.0|I read this before I took up the game.  Great context.  They had a wonderful party mix that showed the diversity of classes and races in the milieu.  Worth your time and must read if you are a new or even pro GW2 player.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|I Don't have 21 words to say about this! I like it and it all worked as it should. great!
B00A6N7BS0|5.0|that was a bad ass movie!! a little disappointed with the ending. def recommend everyone watch this. i n d
B000PT6OY2|5.0|I Don't have 21 words to say about this! I like it and it all worked as it should. great!
B008M87GJK|5.0|I have read BBC news for years on my PC.<br />Now I can read it on my Kindle Fire.<br />Excellent!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I Don't have 21 words to say about this! I like it and it all worked as it should. great!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|very fun - lots of little things for old comic book fans, get pacing keeps the kids interested.  loved the little jokes here and there - good story... nicely done.
B001HMSFFC|5.0|I Don't have 21 words to say about this! I like it and it all worked as it should. great!
B0098VYCCE|3.0|acting was poor - liked the story line, but the actors failed to deliver any real impact in my opinion
B003DNH6DK|5.0|I Don't have 21 words to say about this! I like it and it all worked as it should. great!
B000FBFN1U|3.0|writing is just good enough... now I have to keep going - will chime in with the folks who are a bit perplexed with all of the gritty detail of war/intrigue... some of that color is very well placed - other aspects seem gratuitous and unnecessary... guess one just needs to decide if they like that technique...
B009D5VNLS|5.0|It's a wonderful story for girls, there is no oh help me I'm a princess and need saving.  I think we will watch ity again and again and again.
B00005NP20|5.0|Gerard Depardeu (sp?) is one of my favorite actors.  The story is captivating and will keep you glued to your chair while it is running. It is like a butterfly emerging from its cacoon.
0316232955|5.0|I'll start by saying I've never written a review in my life and I'm not good at getting my thoughts to paper, but I'll give this a try.<br /><br />I didn't expect a lot from this story since it's a teen book and it's been 30+ years since I saw that time of my life. But I really admire Chris Colfer so I wanted to read it. When I was finished with this I had to just sit quietly for a while to digest it. It made me laugh and cry. It brought back memories of my high school years, both good and bad. I \\"recognized\\" several characters from my school days, ones I'd rather forget.<br /><br />But the things that got me the most were the bits of Carson's soul I saw in this (and yes I think Chris' also.) At times it was raw even when I don't think Carson realized it. He isn't a likeable person, but yet I feel like he had learned some things about himself during the journey written in the journal, and that made me like him and mourn him when it was over.<br /><br />I really think anyone can enjoy this book, whether you are high school age or just remember what it was like.
B0091THDOM|5.0|This fits my iPhone 5 perfectly, protects it very well, and is set up for quick and easy phone removal to take a call. Very glad I purchased it.
B001NFU5WE|5.0|Loved this set from the moment I opened the package, anyone who's anyone who likes Batman will absolutely looooove this!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I just love the show! I was very impressed with the amazon purchase, it is very comparable to the microsoft points I usually buy to rent or buy movies/shows on my xbox 360. Since we don't have cable, I must rely on netflix or hulu. I was impressed with how quickly the episode I watched was put onto the amazon inventory, the price, and the quality of video. I also appreciate the gift of $1 credit towards a music purchase of my choice. Thank you, and I will be recommending to my friends
B004UW3VH8|5.0|I'm a sucker for limited edition electronics so this is easily a biased review. BUT that being said this product would be incredible for anyone. Beautifully made and awesome for aesthetics in a room.
B009CG2YDE|5.0|moves great on my kindle/ so far no issues..I like that its old school!!!! all u shooting lover's will enjoy!!  :0)
0143112724|5.0|This is a beautiful book.  It is also an elegant (in the manner of simple and functional) resource. It is so easy to pick up and rehabilitate your style.
B005IZLPKQ|3.0|The movie was well crafted and interesting, even for those of us who thought they knew the story. The ending sets the stage perfectly for the Avengers. As expected with a super hero movie, there is lots of violence that probably makes this a little too scary for anyone under 12. This is a great option for teen movie night, in my opinion. I loved the movie and hope to see [[ASIN:B009GEBBNQ Marvel's The Avengers]] soon as well. Go Marvel!
B001EZ2T7W|5.0|So glad I purchased the movie. I love the Stargate series and this was very good.  The story line and characters kept the action moving
B008GXHOFW|3.0|see i was playing and then the next morning i woke up and was eager to play but then it just kept going back to the main menu????!
0824835921|5.0|I've had this book for about a month now, and already I can read and write(in the correct stroke order) 600+ words. The book is presented very straightforward.  I recommend using Anki(an srs flash card program) with this book, so you can be sure not to forget the Kanji.
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|Another fine product from Rovio that is fun to play.<br /><br />Like the other Angry Bird's series, this will keep you entertained for hours.
B009LK6JS2|5.0|Lov the app,hard for me but my kid picked it right up.highly recommend this app to anyone that wants to fly and land airplane.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Bad Piggies is silly but lots of fun, like most all the games from Rovio! In this one you make contraptions put a piggie in it and roll it down a hill, utilizing various types of propellents. Sometimes you crash but other times you make it to the end and collect stars for your effort. A good time killer when waiting for something, lots of laughs, and how do they figure out how many stars for the effort, sometimes it makes no sense!!
0525953728|5.0|I was able to read this book quickly. It kept my interest and was a fast moving read. I loaned it to a friend who is also enjoying it.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Snow white and the huntsman was a decent movie with some interesting twists to it! As I recall from hearing the story in my youth the huntsman was a minor character but here he is one of the main players. Back in the day it was called Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the dwarfs being some folks who worked mining precious stones and minerals having a fun time singing and whistling all day long. well these dwarfs are a bit different, they are more like societies rejects and have a decidedly negative view of life!<br />Charlize Theron and Kristen Stewart both gave good performances and looked dazzling at the appropriate times. Chris Hemsworth(&#34;Thor&#34;) was a nice choice for the huntsman. In the beginning of the movie I did not recognize him as he looked very much the part, being set in a time before folks had running water in their homes which for the most part were simple huts. But of course he cleaned up real good by the end when he got to the palace, and he had to make that choice between doing the right thing(saving Snow) and just going back to whatever was left of his old life! All in all a decent movie!
B0002234LS|5.0|After his wife's death, writer Mort Raimey is confronted at his cabin by a crazy man named John Shooter. John accuses Raimey is copying his latest short story, and demands justice. Shooter's threats hint on murder. Mort turns to a private detective for help. Things spiral out of control and Raimey realizes that he can't trust anyone. He then has a shocking revelation.<br /><br />This is a great movie. Johnny Depp does a great job as usual. John Turturo also shines in this great psychological thriller. It has a pretty cool twist st the end. It's not all that surprising, considering that there are a lot of movies that end like this one, but it's still pretty cool. I recommend Secret Window to everyone who wants to see a great
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|I thought this video was spectacular. the voices and the animation were very well done and video was fun for both my wife and i and our children. just one caution: there are some scary scenes, you should be aware in case you have children that scare easily.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|River is a special girl. She has been trained and genetically altered to be an elite inhabitant of outer space. Her brother breaks her out of a research facility and brings her aboard the ship, \\"Serenity\\". The crew travels with River and her brother to find the secret kept by the totalitarian regime. They have government agents and monsters chasing them  that will stop at nothing to keep the secrets safe.<br /><br />This is a great movie. I think that I like it more than the Firefly TV series. It has good acing, special effects, and tons of action. There is also plenty of drama and adventure in Serenity. If you are a Sci-fi fan, you definitely need to see this movie.
B009CG2YDE|5.0|nice app that is simple and fun. Space Invaders type game. using galaxy player and it responds great and has good graphics
B00003CXGG|4.0|Han Sing is a former Hong Kong cop now living in Oakland. He shares an attraction to Trish, a mob bosses daughter. Even though they are from rival families, Han and Trish, become very close and try to uncover the truth behind the blood feud.<br /><br />This is a pretty good martial arts movie. As usual, Jet Li kicks everybody's butt. He's the only decent actor in this movie, and he's not that great. The intensity and compelling story keep you interested. Romeo Must Die is pretty good, but maybe not worth owning. I do think it's worth seeing once. So I recommend that you rent it. You may really enjoy it and decide to buy it later.
B007M45PMU|5.0|From the first note to the last, I'm in love!!!  I can't wait for The Lumineers to be back in the area so I can see them live!
B0000AMRJC|4.0|Tony is a refugee from Cuba. He and many other Cuban's have fled to Miami b/c of Castro's tyrannical rule. It's a hard life for immigrants. Tony and his friend get involved with a cocaine ring. Over time they move up in the mafia and Eventually become it's top 2 guys. You don't get that far without stepping on some toes, and Tony's demons are coming back to haunt him.<br /><br />This is an excellent movie. It has good actors, tons of drama, action, and a great soundtrack. Scarface is a movie legend. It has many memorable scenes and lines. The story is very serous and heavy; you will never forget it. The only issue I have with this movie is that it depresses the hell out of me. I think just about everyone can agree on that. This is a 5 star movie, but because I'm depressed after I watch it, I'm gonna give it 4.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|I've always liked the star trek franchise and this movie takes the franchise in an interesting new direction. They got a great young cast as well.
B000YPUF9W|4.0|This time Alice is upgraded. Now she's in the desert and has a group of people helping her kill the zombies in Las Vegas. The Umbrella Corporation is still tracking her and sending their denizens after her.<br /><br />This isn't the best Resident Evil movie. Actually I think it's my least favorite. That being said, it's still pretty darn good. I have always found movies that take place in the desert depressing, I think that's why this one doesn't really do it for me. It's still worthy of the Resident Evil name though. If you haven't seen it, you should give it a chance. It's quite a thrill ride.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|This show is great for anyone who loves sci fi, or who loved x-files. I would recommend this to anyone.
0792844882|4.0|Nomi Malone has what it takes to make it as a showgirl in Vegas. She meets Cristal, the leading showgirl in town. Through her she gets an opportunity to perform at the Stardust in the Goddess show. As Nomi delves deeper in the world she desires, greed, jealousy and rivalry rear their ugly head. The top spot is a coveted position, and she wants it bad.<br /><br />This movie is very different. I think I can see this kind of stuff actually happening. When ambitious and greedy women set their eyes on something, they will leave a path of destruction. This film is about that exactly. Over something as superficial as getting attention and admiration, Nomi ruins careers and hurts people to get what she wants. I hope I never meet a chick like that. This film is very intense. The emotions of the characters are presented in a very good fashion. You can feel their greed and desire coming through the screen. If you like drama, this film is for you. If you just want to see naked chicks dance around, and don't want to spend a fortune at the night club, this film is for you. Otherwise this is just a drama for chicks.
B00275EHJG|4.0|This is the best of the Toy Story movies after the first one and the extras on it are great as well.
B0068FYZIO|5.0|Schindler's list is about the Nazi party womanizer, and war profiteer who saved the lives the lives of more than a thousand Jews during the Holocaust. It's the story of how 1 man with pure intentions can make a difference, and the drama of the lives that survived one of the most terrible times in human history because of his actions.<br /><br />This is one of the most touching movies I've ever seen. It is also a true story. The film graphically shows the horrors of the mass murdering Adolf Hitler, and his SS. At times it is hard to watch, but definitely worth it. If you don't think that 1 person can change the world, you think wrong. Oscar Schindler not only saved the lives of the Jews that worked in his factories, he saved the lives of all their descendants all the way into infinity. That's a hell of a lot of people. If you haven't seen this classic, you need to, but not with children present.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|I've read the book this movie is based on, and while the book is great the movie isn't quite as good. Still entertaining though.
B0015OKWL2|4.0|Turk and Rooster have been partners in the NYPD for 30 years. They could retire, but they are investigating the murder of a notorious pimp that they have been chasing for years. They are trying to resolve a mystery that was thought to have been solved a long time ago. The twist at the end will really get you going.<br /><br />This movie is pretty good. I'm not normally a fan of Deniro or Pacino, but this movie delivers. It's got action, mystery, suspense, and drama. The story is engrossing, and the acting is good as well. The premise behind this movie is awesome, and timeless. Is it okay to kill the bad guys, and is it a crime deserving of punishment? Taking the law into one's own hands is against the law, but should it be? If you are interested in those questions, then definitely watch this movie. If you're not, watch it anyway. It's very entertaining.
B003U0AHBO|3.0|Not a bad movie, it's interesting and has a good cast. It just runs pretty long and can get slow at times.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|DeMille at his best. Fully involving throughout. Det. Corey is one character you want to be like...so many good one liners.
B000UZ4G8M|4.0|This set has a good mix of music that would appeal to a lot of people. I definitely recommend it.
0345529057|5.0|I was hooked after book 1, so it was a good thing I had bought the first 4! The deal for all 4 saved me money too, which is always good.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|I hadn't seen the series when I first saw this movie, but I still loved it and I was able to understand it. Great film.

141659521X|3.0|Vince Flynn is one of my all time favorite authors.  Normally his books grab me and I just can't put it down. This one started in the middle of the action, but didn't make me want to stay there, I'm not sure why? Reminiscent of a Tom Clancy novel - too many foreign names and unexplained subplots to track all jammed into the first pages perhaps? I actually put the book down for a few days before I started it again. Normally unheard of with a Vince Flynn novel. I'm hoping it improves. My biggest disappointment however is the editing. I HATE getting into the storyline of a book and being stopped cold by spelling or grammar errors. I don't remember this being an issue in past Flynn novels. Mr Flynn, I would ask for part of the publisher's commission back as they aren't doing their job! With this book it started right off the bat with the use of to in place of too. Then another similar error. Errors that aren't caught by spell check. Can the publisher no longer afford an editor and proofreaders? These are usually the errors I see in self published novels. Next there are two instances where a word or words are just missing and I couldn't even figure out what the missing word(s) were supposed to be by context. Now realize, I'm less than 1/2 way through the book and felt compelled to stop reading and write this review! Editor, please tell me what this sentence at location 2528 on my Kindle means? \\"He'd learned from the past that transported to the base hospital.\\" How am I supposed to get deeply entrenched in this novel when, BAM, I'm brought out of that world by bad editing? Very disappointing and sad. Do right by your readers Mr Flynn and don't allow another of your wonderful novels to be presented in so poor a package!
030759565X|5.0|I am a relative newcomer to the Smitten Kitchen and have really been dazzled by Deb Perelman's recipes. So far each one I have tried has been a big hit. This is really the type of food that I enjoy making and eating - not too fussy but always interesting. I appreciate that vegetables are really showcased in many of the recipes. The food is not necessarily \\"light\\" but it's always wholesome and I feel great feeding it to my family.

B00A8ECU24|5.0|The game becomes quite addictive after you get into it and the fun of getting the next pony always keeps you going back to check if your shops are done.
0930289234|5.0|It deserves all the 5star reviews it has; it's very symbolic and every detail fits right into place. The characters are interesting and through various inserts at the end of each chapter you get a good glimpse into the whole universe created by Alan Moore in &#34;Watchmen&#34;. It may not be positive, but it is thought-provoking. I liked it much more than the movie.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|Not very impressed with this movie.  My son seemed to like it a bit, but even he lost interest about 2/3 of the way through.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|The series is a must read.  The author's writing style is extremely engaging, and the historical details make it even more intriguing!
B000QCS8TW|4.0|The trailers for the show hooked me, and I got the books before the series aired. I loved them all. This series has filled the Harry Potter-sized hole I had, having grown up with that series.<br /><br />Game of Thrones is a perfect introduction to Westeros, its families, and its conflicts. Intricately plotted, deep characterization, and great writing, this book is a must-read for anyone.

B006VGGAC4|3.0|while Arnold clearly has a fascinated life, the book was too long and spent too much time on the movies he made and not enough on the latest scandal.
B008OJ291W|1.0|After a grand total of two solo releases in over twenty years, you'd think Jeff Lynne must have a small army of great tunes laying about, apparently not. Instead he decides to 'improve' an albums worth of old classics here. Improve in the way that George Lucas, in his own mind at least, improved the various Star Wars releases.<br /><br />So basically Jeff releases two albums, one of remakes, and another of...remakes, of his own songs. Pointless. They're also so close to the originals that it just makes you scratch your head and wonder why he bothered.<br /><br />If you're heart is no longer in it Jeff, and it's obvious it's not, just retire. It really would be sad if one of the music industries formerly most creative artists went out with this album and Long Wave.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Tim mixes it all together: cooking, ted talks, languages, jokes and awesome youtube videos.<br />The book enhances dozens of skills, cooking included.<br />Many pictures of food and process distinguish it from the boring &#34;100 recepies in 30 minutes&#34;<br />Way worth the money spent.
B00447L4JG|5.0|I needed to buy another copy because I lost my original. This movie was shipped and arrived earlier than the original arrival date and came just in time for Halloween! Great movie and movie is great quality!
B006XF5BTG|3.0|The book seemed to be way wordy, takes pages to get to the core.<br />The core itself is pretty much &#34;do your excersises, don't pay the trainer and still it some suppliments&#34; - not what i expected after the intro.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|like the title, this game requires you to really think about a strategy, which i find great. the only frustrating part is it can take hours before getting anywhere.
B009Z8HPYM|5.0|If you are a Neil Young fan you will certainly enjoy this as much as I did.It's as good as previous recordings
B004LWZW4C|5.0|First Class focuses on the origin of three characters (Magneto, Professor X, and Mystique) yet it touches on numerous others including new characters. However, I felt learning about the new characters doesn't stand out nearly as well the ones we already know, despite even having pretty original powers. The old characters get the real attention with some great development on their motives and emotions via some great revelations. However, it seems pretty obvious that the previous films didn't have these revelations in mind with a couple holes that are bit too hard to swallow that none of the characters bring up the events from this film.<br /><br />With all that, seems easy to think that the action might be a bit lacking, yet it finds perfect moments to bring it all with tense battles that utilize the mutants wonderfully. I noticed that the special effects seem to be touch behind other blockbusters, with a couple moments that seem to rely on the CGI a bit too much, yet it doesn't come close to ruining any aspect of the film. The acting is great from most, most notably Kevin Bacon stealing the show as Sebastian Shaw. Also, the other mutants coming to terms with their beliefs on how humans and mutants should live together is often put into the spotlight with great results.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray itself features great video quality to showcase the bright colors the film is almost always using, and great audio quality for the booming explosions and crystal clear dialogue. There are really only four special features but they are all of terrific quality and length, especially the hour long behind the scenes documentary.<br /><br />Most fans would agree that the two X-Men movies before this have been a bit disappointing with more focus on action and tag-lines then actually developing characters farther. Yet First Class finds a wonderful balance between the two by giving some of the most memorable action scenes in the franchise and some great revelations and background development on many of the well known characters. Then, the Blu-Ray release stands tall with fantastic video and audio quality, and a good handful of quality extras. 5/5 stars

B00004X01U|5.0|Madonna dressed up as a pimped out cowboy BEFORE bush was elected...she was ahead of the trends yet again. This was a refreshing point in her career...she still had edge to her but this time around, she is a woman to be respected and doesn't resort of the typical tactics one might expect from her...namely sexual manipulation and vamping it up in torn leggings with a matching cross necklace. Remember, this is the record she released after ray of light and thus she is now an empowered yoga mom.<br /><br />We begin with music and impressive instant, which are both cute and catchy yet both might have subtle ambitions of grandiosity. runaway lover is almost painfully bad...but at least it is universally awful so one will even bother to listen past the first few seconds. i deserve it is an interesting piece all about madonnas own self admitted insecurities involving her need for love. It's very zen and lovely and full of good intent....and hints most of all that this was not a material girl after all. amazing kicks it up a notch with the classic madonna tale of a troublesome boy who cant help but enchant a girl...another victim of love...this is a upbeat beautiful stranger esque number...but again has that genuine heart. nobodys perfect is an auto tune nightmare from hell....a less suffocating musical arrangement would have done the song more justice....but an interesting disaster is interesting nonetheless. don't tell me is one of madonnas most prophetic songs...as easy going as it sounds its intended as a statement regarding what has been madonnas relentless pursuit of unparallelled longevity. what it feels like for a girl encourages the listener to have more empathy for the women...and for madonna while she relentlessly pursues that previously mentioned unparallelled longevity. paradise (not for me) is one of the most intriguing tracks she has ever recorded and one could only imagine what needs to be analyzed. and for the closing track...madonna makes a bold play thatshe would later on head over heels betray, and with such brazen audaciousness...listen to this track and then take one look at the cover for her 2008 release \\"hard candy\\" and it is simply unbelievable that this is the same woman...clearly she gets amusement out of the whole fame game and she is either out of this world nuts, absolutely brilliant, or both. God bless her.

B008GXHOFW|2.0|I got this app for 99 cents. I played for about five minutes, thoroughly enjoying it. Then, my Fire charger broke, so I impatiently waited for the new one to come via Amazon. When it came, I charged my Kindle and eagerly began playing. In the beginning, there an intro you can skip. I skipped it. The app closed. I didn't skip it. The app closed. I turned Amazon Game Circle off, then I turned it back on. I reset my Kindle. Nothing happened. I uninstalled then reinstalled it. For about an hour I tried and retried different things. I finally gave up. I can't play the app nor trust it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I decided to give this Trilogy a try, since it was recommended by a friend. I had no idea what I was getting into. Parts of the book were a bit much, but strangely that is part of what makes this story so much more interesting. I became addicted to finding out what made Christian fifty shades of F*!# up. It is very well written and kept me guessing.

B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Eye-opening ways to show love and be shown love.  Not everyone perceives love the same and this book shows the 5 different ways.  Very useful, especially in today's world where divorce is common.  Every married or soon-to-be married couple should take a look!
140053271X|3.0|My replacement nook simple touch just died.  This is the second to die in less than a year.  Always the same reason ... can't charge the battery ... or rather the battery looses its charge in about 2 days.  This is a long ways from the advertised battery life.  I did all the usual things, like disabling wifi, and nothing seems to help.  So, essentially a battery is good for about 1 to 2 charges before it refuses to hold a charge.<br /><br />I really enjoy the device but can't see myself replacing an eReader every 4 months.  So, I gave the NST a score of 3 star, because its a nice and easy to use eReader.  Reliability issues is a deal breaker for me.  There has to be something more reliable than a nook.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is really really fun! Ive caught myself playing it for a bit longer than I intended...

0316228532|3.0|This is not so much bad as just not great.  JK Rowling shows off her strengths -- particularly being able to get inside the head of middle-aged wives and adolescent boys with stunning authenticity -- but the weakness here is the lack of any real compelling storyline.  In some ways, that is the most disappointing part of this book because that was exactly what she did so well with Harry Potter.  It is also dark to the point of being the anti-Potter.  Rowling sought to write an adult novel and she ended up taking tragedy to an extreme her fans were probably not expecting.  Worth a read, but don't expect a masterpiece.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is the best game ever!!!!! its so addicting and fun. I would recomemd this to all ages. the best ever Ive been waiting since like forever to get this.game on amazon
B0098VYCCE|4.0|I enjoyed the movie. Charlize Theron is an amazing actress and she does an amazing job as the evil queen. Kristen Stewart is not the most talented actress and it is hard to see her as an inspiring leader, but she did well enough as the naive innocent princess in the beginning that I enjoyed myself. I will not ever buy the movie, I feel no need to watch it again but still worth watching!

030758836X|3.0|I'm not a huge fan of mystery novels, but a few friends recommended \\"Gone Girl\\" so I picked up a copy.  Flynn manages to make you think, something that other mystery authors sometimes seem to overlook in pursuit of the next big twist.  Not to say that \\"Gone Girl\\" lacks for plot twists--it certainly has enough to make any avid mystery reader happy.  Overall, it was a worthwhile, enjoyable read.  Will I search out Flynn's earlier works?  Probably not.  But many will and rightfully so.
B003WKOU0G|5.0|Adorable baby movie.  Wish there was a bit more story behind it, but that's part of this movie's intentions.  Straight forward babies!
B000FCK42M|5.0|My introduction to Don Winslow came via [[ASIN:1451667159 Savages: A Novel]].  And while I liked \\"Savages\\" enough to look into his other novels, \\"The Power of the Dog\\" is, at least to me, vastly superior.  Although the staccato writing style is somewhat similar, Winslow isn't as over the top with it in this work.  Moreover, the subject matter is fascinating.  Winslow obviously did a great deal of research to piece it all together and took the time to craft a great storyline.  It reads like a fleshed out non-fiction work more than anything else and that's largely due to Winslow's incredible gifts as an author.  The book does have scenes of graphic violence, but I'm not sure how you could write an honest book about the cartels and drug trade without including them.  If you're interested in historical fiction, history of the drug trade/cartels/government, or just a fan of well written fiction, consider giving it a read.  I don't think that you'll regret it.

B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I am an avid fan of this series. All seasons have been outstanding in their episodes and story lines. Sad that Bobby is no longer in the series but very much like the new characters and of course Sam and Dean continue to &#34;rock&#34; although Dean will sometimes get on my nerves.
B006PZBR8S|5.0|I had to watch this over again, it is so entertaining.  Hugh Jack is a superb actor in this exciting movie.
B005DOJ68K|5.0|CCR was the first rock band I ever liked. This is cream<br />Of the crop for them. Great songs great rock group.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|I can't believe I spent money on this crappy app and it doesn't even work. It won't load the forecast and it won't let me set a city, not a single one! This is the biggest waste of 50 cents ever, I would rather have thrown it away than give it to this worthless, rip off company.
B0043U7XJO|4.0|Unrated version is substantially longer, much more explanatory. Quite good. Interesting take on  Robin Hood , Maid Marian, Little John and the rest.
B00773YOB4|5.0|I have followed Bonnie Raitt's life, music, potential, descent, resurrection, highs and lows for over thirty years. I've seen her live three times--the first before she stopped drinking, the second shortly after she entered her recovery and the third time several years later when she was solid and more comfortable in her own skin and craft then I'd ever seen her...I've loved everything she's released or performed, whether she was strong or struggling, whether it was her best or not.  Fast forward to the Nick of Time years and I celebrated that she'd finally found personal happiness.  Now, we have Slipstream, her first studio venture since 2005.  In the ensuing years since the 1990s she's lost her parents, her brother and that marriage that looked so promising. The result is a Bonnie that I hardly recognized at first...spare, understated, humbled by loss...melted down to her most honest survival essence.  Slipstream is, in short, the best body of work she has ever released.  Gone is the belting voice of the bruised but defiant survivor. Gone (or understated) is her brilliant slide guitar work which has always been her trademark.  Fabulous, but not necessarily beautiful.  Slipstream is simply....beautiful.  It is the music of a woman who has lost everything dear to her, who has had to live through many of life's tragedies and who brought what she still found precious about life into her music to share with/warn/reassure the rest of us. Run, don't walk....if it's on sale, full price, whatever....just get the damn thing.
0810993139|1.0|Terrible book. Completely agree it is mental junk food. Comic books are better natured. I randomly flipped through the second book. It begins with complaints about mother father (for having his son on the swim team). It brags about low achievements in school.  Later, he steals monopoly money from a friend to fool his mother into giving him extra real money because she uses that &#34;mom money&#34; for an allowance. He lies to her saying he'd like to exchange some funny money for money to &#34;buy stamps to write my pen pal&#34;- a complete lie to his mother. I could go on had I ot tossed both books in the recycling bin. Essentially this should be entitled &#34;Diary of a Sociopath who Should be in Family Therapy.&#34;<br /><br />If you feel you'd like your kid identifying with loser, loners, outsiders who, like most sitcom and movie kids, dislike their fathers and mothers, and you'd like to justify that in your kid's mind, by all means pile more money on this exploitative author and reward his &#34;misfit mental junk food&#34; empire.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Very good movie, good sci-fi, story and time line fits in good with other Alien movies.  Graphics very nice too.
B00A4CHZ2K|5.0|Except for a select few American Idol doesn't have a great track record with their winners.  Once those balloons drop, you rarely hear about the winners again unless you're a true fan and you follow.  I liked PP from the beginning and was glad he won.  Wondered what would happen with his originality and creativity and unique phrasings once he was in the studio and \\"they\\" put some pressure on him.  Well, from the sounds of this album - this is HIS album all the way.  Love the feelings he puts into it.  Hopefully the start of a very long career!
B002ZG99J0|1.0|....Or another pointless quasi-remake of an earlier good film? the latter. This film just stinks like poo and pee. don't watch this don't even look at the artwork. avoid like every other stupid PG-13 \\"thriller\\". BAD.
B007C3TVNA|1.0|Just because a film is an Art House film, it does not have to be bad.  But this one is bad.  It is very confusing with no closure in the ending.
B001230RKC|1.0|If you want to hear Jackson Browne's \\"Running On Empty\\" the way it was intended to sound, you have to buy the CD or album. The MP3 cuts off the first 30 seconds of the first track, which consists entirely of crowd noise but sets the tone for the album. It's an embarrassment to mankind that this MP3 version of the album contains edited material!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Downloaded for my Kindle Fire and was watching on the plane.  Another woman saw what I was watching and she warned me it was addictive.  It is!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Follett does a great job of capturing the ebb and flow of the world through great and memeorable characters.  For a 20th century history buff this and the preceeding book are must reads.
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|RIHANNA'S BEST ALBUM TO DATE TO BE HONEST. Y'ALL BETTER BUY THIS MASTERPIECE YOU PEASANTS! UNAPOLOGETIC FOR ALBUM OF THE YEAR.
B009IA3O2O|4.0|I personally like the direction Kamelot has taken with this album.  It's not a 5 because I do not like the new age pop element in some of the songs.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Luckily it is the weekend! I bought this game wanting a thriller style mystery game and so far it has hit the nail on the head. awesome animation and backdrops. Enough clowns and dolls to create a very creepy atmosphere. Great ambience to compliment the story. 3 hours in and 330 in the morning, gotta force myself to stop and go to bed!
B004XANKVO|5.0|The perfect backpack for a busy study needing to organize laptop, textbooks, notebooks and office supplies.  Lots of space, well laid out.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is very fun entertaining and challenge and is infinity I don't see why no body wouldn't like it
B009HV2JT8|4.0|This movie is not meant to be an accurate historical drama, but wonderful entertainment.  Great stunts, wire work and action sequences.  Really fun and a great ending!
B009HEMW4W|5.0|Our entire family loves this movie. Fewer curse words would improve this movie in a major way - but we enjoy it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|A spicy , borders deviant social twist, with an underlying good story!!  A good read for adults  that want something new.
B0038P59A0|5.0|This adaption is charming, funny, witty, and even touching at times, all wrapped in a rollicking good mystery adventure. It doesn't hurt that both Downey, Jr and Law are adorable, and the ladies both lovely, but even so, the film is beautiful to look at. Enjoyed it thoroughly!
B0088TG252|3.0|Denzel Washington plays another bad guy.  I liked the story line and the hero theme, but there was so much blood and gore.
0199536619|5.0|I highly recommend the Oxford World's Classics edition of this deeply poignant book, which I think is one of the crowning achievements of 20th-century art.  David Bradshaw, the scholar who edited this version, writes by far the best introductions I've ever read, and this one is wonderful.  It's beautifully written and so compelling that I couldn't put it down.  I can't imagine a better source of illumination:  not only does it provide crucial historical and cultural context for understanding Woolf but it also directs reader attention to textual details that might otherwise be missed, especially in a first reading.  You definitely owe it to yourself (and Woolf) to take care to order the right edition.
B001EC2J20|4.0|It seemed you could follow the story without having seen the first part, but perhaps that's because I watched them back to back.  I did tire of the fight scenes.  The effects were cool, but not so intriguing since I'd seen them in The Matix.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|This is one of the sweeetest movies I've ever seen!! Excellent! Beautiful and truly heart warming. Worth seeing for the whole family. Anyone who has a sister will surely love it.
B000HAB4KS|4.0|Enjoyed it.  Lots of action and cool effects, and suspenseful too.  Even years after it came out I enjoyed it.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|I downloaded it it didnt work,I deleted it and downloaded it again and it still didnt work. I did this five times and still no luck. If your company is going to have an app that doesnt work and costs an arm &amp; a leg, then the app might as well be free or trash. After numerous efforts and downloads, I didnt even make it to the<br />title screen. How AMAZING RIGHT?
B004P98QZ8|5.0|This is a great toy. However it is way overpriced. Toyrus sells this toy for $90.00 in the store. If you are located anywhere closed to toysrus, go there first.
B0051ZQWYM|5.0|A must read for anyone who wants to understand what happened in 2008. Only other book that I have read hat is equally good is Too big to fail by Andrew Ross Sorkin.
0316227706|5.0|This book is a gorgeous book with most wonderful photos. Makes me smile each time i look at it. Highly recommended.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|This app is awesome I even built a store with every thing in it so I highly recomend you get this app
1419705849|5.0|this is a christmas present and I am sure that the kids will be thrilled to read...I have not read but all the kids love this series
B009CG2YDE|3.0|I got this free today as the free app of the day today from Amazon.<br /><br />This is like at least the 3rd or 4th free app of the day from Noodlecake Studios during the year 2012.  This is a retro inspired game just like Noodlecake Studio's \\"The League of Evil\\" which was also recently a free app of the day.<br /><br />The game reminds me of an old mid-1980s computer game called Save New York City from Creative Software which went out of business like a lot of other computer software companies did in the mid-1980s.<br /><br />The premise is rather simple.  You move your ship left and right while firing blasts at aliens in the sky and protecting 3 eggs at the bottom of the screen.  Every so often there are power ups that fall that you can pick up.<br /><br />It is probably a great game if you like the look of most 8 bit Atari and Nintendo games and like shoot em up games from that time period.<br /><br />One complaint of mine is that you can only move your ship back and forth by tilting your device left or right.  This could possible make a few people seasick doing this over and over for long periods of time.<br /><br />Another complaint I have is that I got asked to review the game after playing this game just one single time.  Noodlecake and other app developers need to stop with the attempts to get you to review the apps right away.<br /><br />Since tomorrow is Cyber Monday, I am hoping that Amazon will pick an app company unlike Noodlecake Studios (who has had several free apps of the day this year) and pick one that has had few or no free apps of the day this year such as an Electronic Arts or Disney to have the free app of the day on Cyber Monday.  It is about time for these bigger app companies to step up to the plate and start giving away an app free once in a while too if the smaller app developers are doing it multiple times a year!
B001URVSPS|5.0|What else can I say...either you're a fan or you're not! I choose 5 stars since I'm a fan and I'm sure if you listen you'd like a a song or two.
B009329Y30|4.0|standard nicholas sparks but well-acted and my wife liked this one a lot, so it worked for date night which works for me:)
B0098VYKSA|5.0|I loved the film making this would have been perfect in 3-D! Chris Hemsworth isn't bad either!! Theron is excellent.
B00A77II0U|3.0|Take out the hidden objects part of it and it would be a 5 star game.  I like the ones that you find objects and figure out what to do with them, like \\"The Secret of Grisly Manor, Bloody Mary Ghost, The Haunt I & II, the Mystery of the Crimson Manor, The Lost City.  No hidden objects in any of these, just find an object and figure out what to do with it.  The hidden picture thing is just a boring waste of time for me.  I think I made my point, LOL. That being said, the rest of the game is fun.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|Who cares about the acting when Channing Tatum is a dancing god!!! Even my mom was impressed! We re watched his dance scenes over and over.
B0007LXPBI|4.0|Based on the reviews, I thought this version might actually be better than the original, but I guess I am a little nostalgic for Hayley Mills. I will say, the characters were well acted. I just prefer the innocent times of the 1960's when it felt like maybe switching places really could happen. In current times, it seems ridiculous to think that the kids with their cell phones and their Facebook accounts wouldn't know about each other. Then again, if you suspend disbelief and can do without the cartoon intro, it's a good (but not fantastic) substitute for the original.
B002361MLA|5.0|There have been few books that have undermined ALL my preconceived notions of life and what happiness is. This book did just that.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I became a big fan of Nate Ruess' pre-Fun. band, The Format, when they toured with Switchfoot way back in 2003 or so. I absolutely love The Format. Their songs are not only incredibly catchy, but poignant and heartfelt. When Fun.'s first full-length album, Aim and Ignite, came out, I bought it, but overall, I'm not super impressed with it. Sure, there's a few good songs on it, but it's pretty meh. I *finally* just downloaded \\"Some Nights\\" album on iTunes a few months ago, after hearing \\"Some Nights\\" on a regular radio station, not knowing who it was by, and thinking, \\"that sounds like Nate from The Format....\\"<br /><br />Much to my surprise, I discovered that that song I'd been hearing all summer, with the strange chorus (We are Young), was also by Fun., and also on this album.<br /><br />This album is terrific. I am inclined to agree with some who say that the 2nd half of the album doesn't quite match the awesomeness of the first half, although I am in LOVE with the bonus track, \\"On the Town\\". Here's what's so awesome about this album:<br /><br />- catchy, catchy, catchy<br />- absolutely relate-able in terms of lyrics.<br />- incredibly honest and heartfelt in lyrics, as well.<br />- Nate (lead singer) is not afraid to question himself or doubt his path in life (don't we all, at times?), and for that, I find the songs all the more engaging.<br /><br />Favorite tracks:<br />- Some Nights<br />- Carry On<br />- Out on the Town<br /><br />Buy this album. I'm thoroughly glad I did.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|MY WAITRESS DISAPPEARED AND NO ONE IS COMING INTO MY RESTARAUNT. FIX PLZ. i was having fun until this happened now i cant play
B007IXWKUK|5.0|EL James has written the perfect love story filled with drama, comedy, and purity. I was drawn in by the characters immediately enjoying every word.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love Star Wars and I love Angry Birds. This is a great update to an awesome game. Everyone should have this.
B000068CNX|5.0|i loved this product it was a great addition to my collection,. i watch it all the time with my wife
B0051YDTKS|5.0|This is the album that started it all for Ozzy! If you really want to hear the birth of modern metal, buy this album!
B00000JPYQ|4.0|It  jams....simple as that....this band is still currently on tour and is still worth the ticket price...would be great to see them
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Liked the new version of the old tale! The queen to me was a much stronger character than snow white. I also loved the broader roll for the dwarfs.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed listening to every song from the first time I played the album.  Philip Philips is top notch!
B00866JL96|5.0|this movie is a sweetheart and perfect for dates. ordered this hoping the uv code be inside.It was not so a contact to vendor was made. Final result was a fast and courteous reply with a valid redemption code for ultraviolet. With vudu working with walmart as well as linking them with my uv it all made it easy for the process. Best bargains are those with a collection of movies for one low price.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Easy read and enjoyed  reading the previous two. Now I will rent the movie. Using my new Kindle Fire and really enjoyed reading this way.
B009MF56GC|1.0|the title of my review says it all....this movie sucked other than comedic value...it really is a disappointment how many ways can i say do not buy this movie...
0394826817|5.0|Highly recommend these book they are are not only a good learning tool but they are also very entertaining. There is a limited amount of words but lots of pictures that you can manipulate to your choosing.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|i really enjoy playing this one, although it is a little tough getting some of the bonus eggs its good for destressing :)
B00846REIS|4.0|I picked this up coming off the 50 Shades trilogy.  How refreshing-- a writer who can write, develop a character, and doesn't bore me to tears with bad dialogue and constant repetition!  Sylvia Day has created a story way too close to 50 Shades to be coincidental, but at least I don't find myself irritated by bad style or poor execution of language.<br /><br />I found the main characters endearing, if a little familiar.  I like that they are equally screwed up, and willing to share the responsibility of addressing their issues.  Secondary characters are done well, though they are sparse.  This story clearly revolves around Eva and Gideon, and there is enough to keep me interested without the sex scenes.  I want to know who they are, what happened to them, what happened to their abusers, how things played out long before the first scene.  I ended this book wanting more of the story.  There is much left unanswered, and I trust that Day plans to reveal things as well as she has thus far.  There's a real story in this book, and it could go in several different directions.<br /><br />One cant review the book without touching on the sex, because it is everywhere.  Day's ability to fog up the windows makes this book one of the best of the current erotica offerings.  She is seldom gratuitous, and the scenes she writes are specific to the point in the book in which they take place.  They make sense.  Since her characters have some dimension, the sex scenes are not boring, and they don't leave me wondering if the characters are truly that dull or just need a thesaurus.  The book flows nicely in and out of the bedroom (or the car, or the table...).<br /><br />If you're looking for erotic chick lit which is well written, with a plot which flows instead of plods, you'll like this much better than what's been raging recently.  Day may mention James in her acknowledgement, but any talent Day possesses is so far superior that comparing writing styles is like comparing comic books to classic literature.
0425263916|5.0|I loved this book can't wait for the next one I could not out it down and could read it again
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I really enjoyed the first book, so I was looking forward to this one.  On the plus side, Sylvia Day can write.  Her structure, vocabulary, the clarity and flow, all make this a very READABLE book.  She writes sex well, and leaves out much of the trite cliches so saturating a certain \\"other\\" erotic series.  This book contains some good, steamy sex scenes, woven with emotion and angst.  Unfortunately, the sex overshadows the story she is trying to tell. It all seems secondary.  If that's why you're reading it, then you'll love it.  If you really want to see some detail and resolution, some character growth and explanation of what makes our hero and heroine who they are, you're likely to be disappointed.  I am hopeful that she will eventually get this all out there, but this book had trouble putting the story in the forefront because she kept putting it to bed instead.  I'm still wondering how Day can write a book so obviously paralleling the 50 Shades series without coming under fire for swiping intellectual property, but I am eternally grateful that she can at least write with precision.
0425263908|5.0|I loved this book can't wait for the next one I could not out it down and could read it again
B007N8RULO|5.0|After a day at work sometimes I just need to let the mind go.  Spider is perfect.  About the adds - it was free!
B007L3BMGA|2.0|I didn't bother reading past Chapter 6. Hotted up Mills and Boon is not my type of book. Wasted money.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|I purchased for a 4yr and put it on her Kindle.  It moves at a fast pace and was frustrating at first, but after a few games she got he hang of it and just starts it again when it goes to fast.  I would recommend for 5yr+.
B007T9FRFS|4.0|I really enjoy Kathy Reichs' books. This one is no exception. Hooks you right into the story and keeps you there.
B0095R64AO|5.0|If you like Jason Segel, you'll like this one.  Would watch again.  Gives you a lift due to the funny nature.
B00A6N8F4Y|3.0|the acting was good, but as an action movie, there was very little suspense. The plot was interesting, but not too believable.
B008458O3S|5.0|Initial &#34;cities&#34; build on techniques for solving the more advanced cities.  Very enjoyable pasttime.  Works well on my Asus TF300T tablet running latest Android v4
B007V65R54|3.0|But too much personal story-telling, not enough data work.  I would have liked more current events-based story and less old baseball stats talk.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|This movie is great, one of those you need to watch a few times to get the little &#34;clues&#34; and has one of those unexpected endings.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Confusing plot, mostly uninteresting characters, retreads of baubles from Alien, themes just pasted on with no support.  The only reason I would give it 2 stars is the special effects.  Oh, and did I mention gratuitously gross?  Maybe the original Alien movie was a fluke.  Do yourself a favor and watch it instead.
0425263916|5.0|I enjoyed the continuing story and look forward to the next one,  Entwined in You.  It is suppose to give up more info!!!
B004JN1D2I|1.0|I am shocked to see so many reviewes saying the book is great. I  love sci-fi and fanatasy but I couldn't even get through the fist book.<br />The writing is disjointed, very dry and pointless. Murder and violence happen, evil trumps the good to what end?<br />Is the author trying to prove that every human is evil and corruptable at the core? Perhaps, but I don't read fanatsy books for that.Defeinitely not 4 books. I read books for enjoynment and I don't enjoy reading about pointless gore.<br />These books should be reclassified as horror. Fantasy they are not.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|Great way to try cloud storage.  It's easy to upload pics from phone or camera<br />and view at work or at home on PC.  Love the idea.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is actually my second purchase of this DVD. I used it so much, I wore it out. Jillian Michael's has a great 3-2-1 system that gives you a maximum workout in a short amount of time. I highly recommend this DVD for beginner to advanced.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Rovio keeps knocking it out of the park !!! My son and I both love angry birds and all its versions. This downloaded fine on my Droid and never crashes.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Excellent portrayal of a strong,confident and capable young lady.I loved this movie because it doesn't follow the typical<br />stereotypes of many movies for kids,showing girls as divas,helpless,wanna-be princesses and ultra feminine or tough-as-nails mean,cruel and ultra masculine.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Once again Rovio has a hit. All the versions of Angry Birds have been superb and have kept the interest of my son and I
B004WJV6OY|5.0|Love this DVD, again watched it many times and enjoy it each time.<br />Would recommend this to all.  Eddie Vedder is truly a great performer.
B00A6PD8RQ|3.0|It was Ok..one time watch...my 5 yr old got a bit scared during the movie. Overall Ok not so great..
B009NOVCTM|5.0|First, Why is \\"Bitch\\" left off every \\"Best of\\" Greatest\\" etc...? But I have to admit that I can't give the Stones any lower rating then 5 on anything! \\"Doom and Gloom\\" kills it! I mean what will you be doing at 70? drooling and wondering why you weren't Keith Richards. They rule so I can't really say anything bad about this box either. If you aren't a Stones completeist and just want to bask in the glow of the way Rock & Roll should be written and performed, GET IT! GRRR!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I really enjoy this game. you can do most things without buying things with real money. (at least I have so far)
B005HI4LLY|5.0|Extremely funny movie.  It's got redneck humor, drama, gore, a blond bimbo, PBR, and a clear rip-off of a Monte Python joke.  Stop reading these reviews and buy the movie...It's well worth the watch.
B00003CXCT|4.0|Pretty standard.  The movies got here quickly and will be a Christmas present for my father in law. It's his favorites.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Great film with a great story line. Great for all ages and both boys and girls.  We will purchase for sure.
B0033H7VI6|4.0|This is a very tough and heavy knife. It will perform any task needed from a survival knife. You would have to work hard to break this knife. It holds an edge very well.  I chopped a couple of pine 1X4's in half, chopped off several pieces of 1/2&#34; rubber hose, and it was still very sharp.<br />The handle is not very smooth and I guarantee you will get blisters if you do a lot of chopping with it without gloves. ( I am a construction worker with years of calloused up hands too)<br />The sheath is very well made.<br />I would recommend this knife for a good camping knife. Pretty heavy to be hiking with.
B004F1F32A|4.0|Eye opener for teenage girls to understand why we protect them! This movie teaches about the ever growing sex trafficking industry.
B0068RHSCW|3.0|First, do not watch the film's trailer, which gives away too much of the plot. But even if you don't, you will be disappointed with \\"Dream House\\" despite the big names attached to the project, including the Oscar-nominated director Jim Sheridan.<br /><br />\\"Dream House\\" centers on Will Atenton (Daniel Craig), a businessman who recently quit his job to live with his family in a quiet house in the New York suburbs. He has a wife Libby (Rachel Weisz) and two lovely daughters Trish (Taylor Geare) and Dee Dee (Claire Geare). Will thinks he can spend more time writing a book until he notices a suspicious-looking person hanging around his house. And Ann Patterson (Naomi Watts), a neighbor living across the street, seems to know a few things about what is going on.<br /><br />Or maybe not. Written by David Loucka (\\"House at the End of the Street\\"), \\"Dream House\\" attempts to subvert genre conventions and create something new. Unfortunately, the film seems to have achieved only a limited success, either as a psychological thriller or a character-driven drama ... or whatever it is.<br /><br />For the film tells its story very slowly without building tension, while laying out clues that only confuse, not intrigue, the viewers. The actors are doing their best, but for all the talented players and the palpable chemistry between the two leads, the pace is sluggish and the story - or the \\"truth\\" - is after all not as interesting as filmmakers think.<br /><br />After watching the film, I read on the Internet a few interesting behind-the-scene stories about the film's production, namely about \\"artistic differences,\\" something that is not rare in Hollywood. So, where is the director's cut?
B0025YKDJC|4.0|I am only rating how much I enjoyed this movie.  I generally like Jim Carrey movies, and this one did not disappoint.  It was funny, kind of romantic, and just an overall enjoyable movie.  If you like Jim Carrey movies, I would check this one out.
B000FC1RCI|2.0|I have multiple copies of this Agatha Christie classic under both titles.  My kindle edition has , in the interest of political correctness, changed &#34;Indian&#34; to &#34;Soldier.&#34;  This is over the top political correctness.  Had I known the kindle edition incorporated the word change I would have one less copy of the book.  Give me a break.  This is the ultimate insult to one of the great authors of the 20th century.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I happened to start watching season 1 on netflix and found it very very interesting. I liked it so much that I starting searching for season 2 and finally found it on Amazon. I Love this series. I'm almost finished with season 2. I am taking my time watching it because season 3 is not out yet and I know I will miss watching this show. I love it.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I really love this. I like being able to mix my own sounds...and the sound waves for sleep are the best! I know there is a little trouble when the sounds loop, but its nothing that distracts me. I love using it when I am working or trying to fall asleep. It is ideal!
B0083GQ2A0|5.0|This movie's final moments made the whole movie worth watching. The movie is good but the ending is powerful and epic. Liam Neeson is a strong presence on the screen and I can't imagine another major Hollywood actor playing the part. HIs delivery of the final moments of the movie gave me chills.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Columbo was one of the very best TV series ever.  And, perhaps, the very first one that actually SHOWED YOU WHO DID IT AT THE VERY BEGINNING and then proceeded to hold your interest the entire rest of the show.  Truly one of the very first and only series that managed to pull that off.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  And a revelation for every new generation of TV watchers...
B000ULQV0W|5.0|This soundtrack is a nice collection of music but the song \\"Guaranteed\\" is awesome! It speaks to the soul and is well worth the price of the entire CD.
B0081TZETY|5.0|Liars is one of my favorite bands, and with this album they show their creativity has reached no bounds.  I agree with a previous reviewer that you'll either love them or hate them.  If you're listening to them for the first time try these songs, which I find the most enjoyable of the album: Octagon, Ill Valley Prodigies, Brats, Annual Moon Words.  Although really the whole album is a wonderful trip to a mood impossible to describe...but better to experience...
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|The Lumineers put their heart and souls into their music. They have their own unique sound but if I had to put them in a category of who they share a musical kinship ... I'd say if you like Mumford and Sons or the Brian Buckley Band you'll be illuminated by The Lumineers.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|It was very useful.  My daughter & I used it to complete her homework assignment.  Kid friendly too!  She is 7.
B0081FO2Q4|5.0|Ed Sheeran's music is simply lovely. First found him thru Nizlopi... years ago. Have kept up with his music thru the years and am super happy with this album. It's peaceful yet upbeat and catchy with super sweet lyrics. Wonderful. :) Only wish his upcoming show in my city hadn't sold out so quickly! I'd LOVE to see him live!
B007L6VR12|2.0|Brilliant? Miraculous? Nonsense. This movie is a complete waste of time and I wish I had my hour and a half back--which actually felt like about four hours. These kids could not act their ways out of a paper bag. Everything that is wrong with the movie industry today--right there for your viewing. Ugh. Save yourself the pain of having to sit thought this one.
B008YUNDJS|3.0|Good read, some great tips for how to communicate in all works of life. Really worth reading this book. Thanks
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It is a page turner and the plot keeps you on the edge of your seat. Still, I would regard this for teens.
B002ROKQJM|5.0|This is entertaining and well written.  I feel that Adiga portrayed both the people and the places vividly without getting bogged down in detail.  I found it hard to put down and would definitely recommend.
0316056871|4.0|Tina is very open about her life.  She had the same awkward struggles of youth that all of us had.<br /><br />She has  entertaining stories from her career , and also plenty of interesting info about marriage and parenthood.<br /><br />A good read.  You will definitely want to get all the way through this
B00933JF74|5.0|I have played other Townsmen games and of course enjoyed the way you are able to interact with the characters to build their society. This offering takes that to a whole new level! There are many more way to advance and create your village. I love it!
B0055V6EZE|4.0|My mother must have asked me a dozen times, &#34;this is HOUSE?&#34;.  Yes.  &#34;He SINGS?&#34;  Yes.  Hugh Laurie is talented, listen to the preview & buy the CD.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|From the beginning to the  end I loved this book.  And found it interesting page after page . It is very sexual and even at 58 years old I learned  some new things ( oh boy did I ever) , but it a wonderful love story full of romantic love and how love can be such a life changing phononama . I can't wait to read the next book in this series . Thank You,  E L James  for giving me this.experience.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|In the book Wonder the story takes the view of a deformed boy as well as his family and friends.  It is not all peaches and cream the peers are tough on him and that is ok he knows that is how the real world is.  His parents sheltered him as a child and then he finally got to go to real school where he was able to thrive.
B00004W50T|5.0|I wish I would have payed more attention to these<br />guys in the 70's,better late than never.Too bad the are almost<br />all gone now.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|Seem like fun. I have enjoyed the game.  Kids really like it .  good for all ages.  Thanks for the fun
B001HM1PFO|3.0|Kinda fun to watch, very campy.  I really don't see why folks would go out of their way to dress up and go see it multiple times.  But then again, I went to a Renaissance festival recently and saw a bunch of people dressing up to play like dungeons and dragons.  Wow, there are a lot of folks who need something real to do!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|this is both chalanging an fun my 6 year old grandson feels that it is the greatest game ever made
B009XY97VC|5.0|I love Skyworld and Two Steps from Hell.  Its just good dramatic, stimulating, music.  Then again I grew up listening to Classical Music first and Rock and Roll second.  So the hybrid of orchestral tones backed by bass and drums is the &#34;best of both worlds.&#34;
B009CG2YDE|3.0|Game Play:<br />You tilt your device left to right to move the Velocispider and position him below your target and you touch the bottom of the screen to charge your weapons. There are 20 levels to play in the game. There is an IAP to pay $0.99 to unlock all levels.<br /><br />The game is simple and you just tilt your device and move the shooter along the bottom of the screen. The enemy comes across the top of the screen and once they make a complete pass they move down one row. They drop presents for you so catch them and help your score or enhance your weapons. They are also shooting at you and dropping bombs, avoid them. Your weapons fire automatically but if you touch the bottom of the screen you charge up your plasma weapon which is more powerful. You won't need it on the first few levels but the enemies get harder to beat as the game goes along.<br /><br />After completing level 4 the game asks you to review it.<br /><br />Main Screen:<br />* Play<br />* Special effects sound off<br />* Music off<br />* ? simple instructions<br />* More - a long list of games with multiple links to Amazon to buy them plus links to Facebook, Twitter and email to the developer to subscribe to their mailing list.<br />* Amazon Game Circle - a list of your possible achievements and a link to rate the game and take your ideas and suggestions.<br /><br />What I like:<br />The game features simple but effective graphics and it is fun to play. It is truly a retro style arcade type game and the action gets harder as the game moves along.<br /><br />What I don't like:<br />Links to buy more games from Amazon and links to Facebook, Twitter and to the developer's news email sign up list.<br /><br />There is an IAP to unlock all levels so turn off your IAP settings so your kids won't pay for this. You can also set your parental controls.<br /><br />There is a pop up in game request to review the game that comes after level 4.<br /><br />Summary:<br />The game is retro arcade and fun but it gets hard after several levels with enemies that are harder and harder to kill. How else could they tempt you to pay more money to unlock the game levels? I do not like IAPs and paying to unlock levels just makes the developer create levels that are too hard to beat to entice you to spend money. This game also has many links to the web to buy games and go to the social networks. Turn off your WIFI or put your device in airplane mode. You might even set the parental controls to keep the children from pressing the wrong buttons.<br /><br />The game itself is not bad but it starts off very easy. It is a good retro game but the IAP and links drag it down for me. I rate it 3 stars for the IAP and all the fake reviews.<br /><br />Size: The game uncompressed to 22.52 MB on my Kindle Fire.<br /><br />Permissions:<br />* Storage - modify/delete storage contents<br />* Network communications - full internet access<br />* Network communication - view network stateunlock the game levels?

B002G1K82Q|5.0|This was the best movie ever. It had ALL my favorite Beatles songs. I'm a huge Beatle fan. I know almost every song and am so happy I watched it!! :D
B009HEMW4W|3.0|more tommy lee less Josh Brolin<br />would make it better like the will and tommy as a team more just saying
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Came in with low expectations, am about 50 pages from finishing and could not be happier with this story. Very creative and well written!
B00866JL96|5.0|I was pleasantly suprised by this movie. I really fell in love with it! I wasn't a big Zac Efron fan but I'm officially hooked.
B004EPZ00C|4.0|A much better plotline and better use of Rowan Atkinson's talents than the first film. Written more along the lines of a classic spy film, Reborn takes us to foreign locales, lets us see spy gadgets and enjoy the antics of a strange enemy assassin, in this case the Cleaning Woman. All the while, Atkinson is showing off his comedic talents, but in this case as a spy who just has bad luck, not a total incompetent. Thoroughly enjoyed it!
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I gave this five stars because it arrived in perfect condtion and arrived very quickly. I would recommend buying this set.
B009CG2YDE|5.0|it's simple is retro and its fun. i would've paid for it. it's really worth the .99 price tag. controls are simple. easy to pick for a quick game, nothing too involved and the game flows really well from one level to the next.
B0006JGFNQ|5.0|granddaughter just loved it. was perfect gift for the new generation of gizmo fans. loved the way it sang and lasted forever on 1 set of batteries
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|This is a sweet little time-wasting game with good graphics. I love the music that busts out every time an animal pops out of the woods. The only reason I'm giving this game 1 star is because after I reached a certain level it crashes on me. This happens when I try to buy an eagle, mayoral mansion, or basically anything that requires scrolling all the way to the right when in the store, so I now cannot purchase anything required on one of my 14 missions and therefore can't advance anymore into the game. I thought this would be temporary but after contacting support several times it remains to be fixed.
079284131X|5.0|looked everywhere for it. couldn't find it in any store. was great being able to get it with any hassle or worry
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Great movie. Action packed. Kids watch it over and over. It has saved my sanity more than once when it's too rainy for them outside.
B00785P2QC|4.0|up to yesterday I had no need to be connnected to play.<br />As of yesterday, after signing up for the newsletter etc if no connection no game. So it will be no game. I'm sorry but shitty organisation
B001FB563E|1.0|The DVD would not operate. It would boot to the menu, then stop operating.  I purchased another copy from a retail store, and the DVD did the same thing.  Tried it on two different Blue Ray players.  I suspect the discs were formated wrong.  Beware of THE ROAD in Blue Ray bd format.
B008WCP2PG|4.0|I really love Channing Tatum! He is very sexy, and it was fun to watch, but the story line was kind of bad.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is awesome and really intertaning for me I play it so much I think you would like it too!
B0027I93U6|5.0|Dexter is my ultimate favorite show. I have seen every episode on Showtime, through Amazon I am planning on collecting every episode.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This movie is great! It plays great on my tv and the 3D is amazing. Price was great too! Recommended.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|From all the posts this is a BIG PROBLEM.  Are you working on getting the NEWS FEED WORKING?  It only allows the first page then bugs endlessly.
B006FE83UE|5.0|My son wanted to watch this as he was playing Atticus Finch in his English class.  This is a wonderful classic and he really enjoyed watching it after he read the book.
B00956UPSW|5.0|This EP represents the future of music in the digital age - several killer tunes released primarily for digital download.  As done here, Phil and the gang have recorded 6 classic Down tunes, all of which are heavy sludge-fests without the filler seen on a 12-15 song LP.  Best music they've released since NOLA - strongly recommended, and I greatly anticipate the next EP next year.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Very well written.  Jodi paints a picture of characters and situations to where the reader can feel, smell and become them.  I sat up very late reading, which I rarely do lately.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|I used to rush home from school to watch Dark Shadows. At the time I never thought about how Barnabus would have responded to the current culture, etc. I loved that in this movie. I also loved with they did with the Dr Hoffman character. Imagine several years of watching this soap all rolled into less than 2 hrs--- works for me.
B007JMW46U|5.0|Sherlock is one of the great literary characters of all time and this book showcases him beautifully! Enjoyed it thouroughly!
B00708LBFS|2.0|I thought perhaps it would be interesting to see what the extra stuff sounds like.  Well, don't waste your time, it is garbage.  Buy the digital remaster released earlier instead.
B00913DPW2|5.0|My kids and I spent the Thanksgiving weekend solving this little gem. I have to admit that we did consult the 'cheat page' for the more intricate puzzles( connecting wires and tile puzzles). Good fun.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|I like to think that I pay decent attention to details in a movie. I didn't enjoy Prometheus because I felt that too much was left unexplained during key moments. I don't mind a movie which leaves you with questions, but important scenes in the movie felt as if they happened by chance. My biggest judgement for the movie were the plot holes. In my opinion they easily stand out and the movie isn't the least apologetic about it.
B0098VYCCE|1.0|worst adaptation<br />worst acting by everyone - everyone is sooooooooooooooooo dramatic<br />worst editing - a lot of the scenes are very dark<br /><br />worst worst worst
0345803493|5.0|great book keepsyou going not wanting to put it down.  Makes you fantisize a little  I just  think this book makes you want to do thing like that in your own home
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Keeps you wanting more<br />Guaranteed that you will want to read catching fire and soon after Mocking jay<br />The book is certainly more descriptive than the movie
0425263916|5.0|great book cant wait until next one .  hope its as good this book makes you feel like its you and you wont be able to put it down
B009UFD8GO|5.0|I don't own this particular special promo cd but I do own the LP from Japan complete with obi (in Japanese). Its considered to be virgin vinyl. The work Jimi does here is some of my favorite from the amusing to OMG. I enjoy \\"Belly Button Window\\" as it makes me laugh but wow what an imagination. \\"Ezy Rider\\" is also a favorite. It's a trip to what his future music was doing and it is great!
0345803507|5.0|I found nothing I disliked except I thought it needed a longer ending. Also they leave you hanging a little with what happened with the time before the wedding.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I highly recommend reading this series. I couldn't put it down and can't wait to read the rest of these books
B0079J28NC|5.0|I like this animated movie with the Beatles and I enjoyed the title song yellow submarine,along with the other fun songs. This is a classic for the Beatles fan everywhere!
B008CFN95I|5.0|A wonderfully woven tale. Was holding my breath to the finish. I am looking forward to more from Robin Sloan. Well done.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Easy to use and<br />it's of fun! This is an enjoyable app and makes picture editing lots of fun. Will be using this app all the time!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Such a great movie for everyone! Love the action and humor. Definitely makes the movie much better if watched after seeing all the movies of the characters that make up the Avengers.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This was a great story. Not a traditional narrative, full of incredible creativity and kept me coming back. Definitely a must read!
B009CPGHDI|5.0|There was one curse word at the beginning of the movie, other than that, my kids really enjoyed watching the concert performances. They &#60;3 Katy Perry!
0061124265|4.0|Loved this book as much as the Alchemist, if not more. Coelho really makes you think and gives you perspective. A great read.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great book. I could not stop laughing at a paragraph written about baf... saying the most dangerous part was pmo writing tickets for speeding and not wearing a reflective belt. All I have to say is I'm glad its not only us in the air force that was frustrated about that. The book keeps you in it at all times, and really tries to illustrate everything that's happened to the point you can almost see everything happening. I recommend this book to all military members. As well as to anyone who likes a good non fiction novel that drags you in immediately.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I purchased and sent back a few kindle covers. But this one was exactly what I was looking for.  I have recomened it to all my friends with kindles.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Good quailty 4 the price, fun that u can upload ur own card backs and background, and I improved with practice. Didn't like all the adds which pops up every single game you play. Would be more effective to have them only when you start a new session.
B007Y1ARLA|2.0|I was simply amazed to find out that the song that gives its name for the title of the album is not included in the album I bought and downloaded. the title of the song is &#34;strangeland&#34;.
030758836X|1.0|After all the hype and glowing reviews, I decided to read Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl. I don't usually read books like this - and now I remember why.  While it's certainly a suspenseful page-turner that was, at least some of the time, enjoyable to read, I can't help feeling a little embarrassed for having picked it up in the first place.  This book has absolutely no literary merit or real substance at all.  With this genre, crime stories/suspenseful thrillers, most people probably realize what they're getting into.  It's like a cheap thrill - you want to know what will happen next, but by the end, you don't really care and the story will quickly fade from memory.  I realize there's a huge market for books like this, and I can see why some people would like it.  For me, it just doesn't work that well.<br /><br />In many ways, this book reminds me of one of those godawful TV movies of the week that used to be so popular back in the early 1990s - think Lifetime.  Its plot is just way too over the top.  There's not a shred of believability in this entire novel, and I don't see how anyone could relate to the two main characters, Nick and Amy.  They're not believable as real people, and they're just not likeable in the least.  I'm also kind of surprised this book was written by a woman for it's monstrous, hugely unflattering portrayal of almost every woman in the book, especially Amy.  The book is strewn with cliche after cliche, such as how New Yorkers behave in comparison to middle-Americans (they're all snobs who look down on the rest of the country).<br /><br />And the ending of the book is simply preposterous.  Just when I thought the story couldn't get any more ridiculously unrealistic, it does just that.  I have no idea what the author was thinking, but this is literally one of the worst book endings I've ever read.<br /><br />I hear rumblings that a movie based on this novel might be in the works. If that happens, I truly hope they improve upon the story for the bigscreen, which is something that rarely happens.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|If you loved the book series THE HUNGER GAMES then read NIGHT CIRCUS!<br /><br />word of advice:<br />keep track of what year/era/decade the chapter you're about to read is in, for it can get confusing if you do not take note of the chapter change. This book is a \\"page\\" turner and in the excitment you might just keep reading without noticing.
B00003CXD5|1.0|I purchased this dvd in March of 2011 and last night I finally got around to watching it. There is a 10 minute period in the middle of the movie that will not play. Now I like amazon.com, but I have been getting a lot of defective dvds from them recently. I will no longer buy any dvds from them that I do watch immediately. I have gone many years with out ever having a problem. There are too many sub-contractors making discs and too little quality control.
B0086700CM|5.0|At first I didn't know what temple run was (I know right) so at school my friend was playing it on her ipod and when she told me to try I couldn't stop playing it so then I went to the app store and bought.  people take it from me and other people : get this app it is free and fun although a bit tricky.  but you must get it
B008XG1X18|5.0|you will get hooked and wonder where the hours go to. so many good ideas to try and cook. love
B008JIFJ4W|5.0|Catchy synth-rock that doesn't go off in the &#34;Let's get weird&#34; Hot Chip direction but stays fairly grounded in nice hooks and melodies.  It's not some conceptual masterpiece but if you like up beat music that you can bob your head to pick this up, put in your headphones and take a walk.<br /><br />(see what I did there)
B0049VZ222|5.0|the first episode will get you hooked! then you will want to keep going with season 2, yup, love it
B00785P2QC|4.0|Great game but investment point get hoses up.other than that I like the g5 game products.have a nice day every body.great game.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Its a harder game but the falcon makes it more of a challenge. Every time there's an upgrade its better.
0981951252|5.0|This Audio Cd or Cds are very different from traditional types of motivational plans for a better word. I found the info easy to follow and understand it is so simple in it's message. You must keep going to achieve. It is one thing to attain, but it is certainly another to maintain. We can all start off with a hiss and roar, in any of our endeavours, but the truly successful person, just keeps on going and going and going, hence the compound effect. 11/10
B002OHDRF2|4.0|You just can not beat the price, but when shipped in thin plastic bag, the case was severely damaged making Me concerned about the product, but disk is OK. Will buy from them in the future.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I saw this at the theater and had to have it when I got my 65&#34; 3D tv. It is still such a great Movie!
B009VB7QQA|5.0|I did read the book and surpisingly enjoyed it.  I was looking forward to the movie based on the book.  The movie glosses over some of the more important parts of the book.  Suspend your belief and enjoy this movie not for its historical accuracy but for the fun ride that it is.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I play it every day and when my little cousin comes over and wants to play I let him play one game of course I let him play a very small amount of games then I back him of so I can play my solitaire. I LOVE THIS GAME
B007Q0OV6Q|3.0|Lego continues to charge very high prices for these sets which sometimes takes two to three days to complete one item.  C'mon Lego, lower the pricce and more people can participate in this fun activity.
B004U52VPS|5.0|Why should you buy this toy over a simple tablet app? After all with a video game your child gets loads of levels and more variety. True. Here's where your doing your kid a favor, by letting them be truly interactive. Kids today lack even the simplest building skills. Have you challenged a kid lately to build something with Legos? How about anything where they use their imagination to construct something? Well with this game you get to trick your kids into something modern with the Angry Birds brand name, but they are actively......wait for it.....playing.<br /><br />This toy is fun. I've played it with my five year old several times and it is truly entertaining. It's old school. The basis is like this: you build it, you knock it down......then you do it again. A winner take all and the loser gotta-build-again type of learning. It's simple.<br /><br />I fully recommend this toy. Its fun. It's not the greatest toy ever made, but it's fun and it's a step in the right direction if your sick of your kids being lazy players. Sometimes simple is better. Cheers!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I'm new to the device and it took a bit of time to learn how to start  new game.  Will learn more apps.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|One of the better family Christmas films I've seen in a while. I'm more if a grinch so that says something but enjoyed watching with my wife and daughter
B00594XOZU|4.0|I left out the 5th star because sending text to people sometimes would take 30 minutes after to send. I have to say that most of the time it would send right away.<br /><br />R-Sent<br /><br />S-still sending<br /><br />D-still sending
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I read fantasy. Plain and simple. I've read hundreds and hundreds of books. This series ranks with the top books I've ever read. It was entertaining from start to finish. My only remorse is the third book isn't out yet. I think I'll read them again when it finally arrives since its well worth the revisit. Wow!
B009DT98RK|5.0|If I can describe this Blu Ray in one word...PERFECT!  I own hundreds of concerts and this is an absolute desert island release!
B006P8JL5Q|5.0|This Brazilian gem is awesome. She is a huge hit in South America and Europe and deserves to be in the USA as well. She rocks and has such a huge voice from such a cute little lady!
B007SGM084|4.0|this is a good book but i guess i'm not as hyped about it as everyone else is.  can do w/o it
B001S0YADY|5.0|This Brazilian gem is awesome. She is a huge hit in South America and Europe and deserves to be in the USA as well. She rocks and has such a huge voice from such a cute little lady!
B001F6ZIXC|4.0|This show started a little slow and I had to do a little research to catch certain terms being thrown out. Regardless of that, the last few episodes were fantastic and kept me going onto the second season.
B0058U0EEO|5.0|At first I thought it was odd to have music that clarly has singing in the background when I realized that they were not actually signing words. However, the easy beats and sounds and the fact you don't have to memorize any words you just have to enjoy the relaxing sounds make this group's style well worth it.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Great movie although I may be biased because I've read the trilogy, I'm just not a fan of long movies. 2:22 minutes is too long in my opinion
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|I bought this for my granddaughter and she watches it constantly... A very good choice. Wpold like to get part 2.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game will keep you coming back for more. You must drop the coins and try to get them to stay on the board and not drop off the edge. The more you play the faster your coins regenerate.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is very CoOl and I'm not sure why! Download it NOW! Put down the fruit cup and potato chips and press the downloading button. I am hungry now ;(  By the way the 8 in 8) is supposed to be the eyes I thought of it by myself 8)
B0085Z8F4A|2.0|keeping this short. this movie was a large let down, it was so obvious that the story line was not original. It had pieces tack on especially the end.  Not the CG was astonishing. the character one dimensional. and I'll just leave it like that. better to view it that to own it.
B0000AK7AA|5.0|Casper has always been a favorite of mine since my kids were little! If you don't have this in your Halloween collection you must get. Great movie, great price, received in no time at all. Would recommend movie and seller to anyone.<br />Thanks
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|You can get lost for hours with this game. This is the type of game you end up talking to.
B005LW5J9O|5.0|I have not quite finished this book, but I found it fascinating. I thought I was pretty well versed in things historical, but I certainly learned a lot from Mr. Greenblatt. I do wonder if the title is off putting. It is indeed accurate, but some might not investigate and miss a wonderful book.
B009RI4FRU|2.0|I don't understand why so many people who previously disliked Wes Anderson like this movie, for me it is one of his least successful efforts - actually not unlike one of those skits where kids read the lines from presidential debates, or maybe one of those ads where toddlers speak like adults.  Here all the action is with two children, who mouth words that are clearly coming from an adult (and hipster) mind. Painfully boring and unoriginal.
B005FJ7DOM|4.0|I avoided this movie for quite a while mainly due to the title.  It's name conjured a campy and cheesy vampire flick, which there is nothing wrong with if you are in the mood for it.  This movie was far, far, from my expectations.  It was a wonderfully told and acted piece about a vampire apocalypse and a small band of survivors struggling to find a safe place.  It was bleak, gritty, and raw but didn't feel cheaply made at all.  It actually had a very AMC's Walking Dead feel to it.  There were no fancy and flashy special effects, just very decent makeup and gore.  It instead relied on good story telling and sucking the audience into the characters' plight.<br /><br />My only real complaint is that the ending could have been done a bit better.  I wasn't really sure of the motivation behind what Mr. did and would like to have known what became of him.  Still this film rates very highly with me and I'd highly recommend you take a visit to Stake Land after which I'm sure it will rate highly with you too.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|The best mystery game so far!! Intriguing story line and easy to follow. I cant wait for the next one.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|pretty easy but for a mindless game to take away stress - it is nice.  Give it a try and see.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Execellent collection to possess by every blu ray disc viewer. mastered video and execellent audio and overall the full package is a fantastic collection to possess. the packing is also good.
1401322786|5.0|This is a quick read about how we should appreciate what we have at the time and place we have it.  There is much wisdom in this little book...the quote I love most is found on page 205 ... \\"With endless time, nothing is special.  With no loss or sacrifice, we can't appreciate what we have\\".
B004UID2LC|5.0|I love to watch youtube videos and I have been looking for an app that lets you watch them with no wifi. This app is perfect you should get it.
0385535147|5.0|I have not read John Grisham in a very long time.  Liked the description of the book and thought I would give it a go.  Loved the book.  Easy read and will keep you up late turning the pages to see what happens next.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great after you level up a few times and regain your energy  i do wish you could make the other settlers go out to do things
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|True to themselves, Pentatonix created another album of beautiful harmonies,  creative and intricate arrangements, and a brilliant a capella sound.  It is already my favorite Christmas album this year.  I wish they'd had the time to put together more songs for the CD, but this is truly a great collection.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Awesome movie Great for a mother - daughter kinda movie day! Can be kinda scary for much younger girls.  The bears can get ferocious!
0689878451|5.0|This was such an adorable story.  And the fact that it's based on a real story made it that much better.  Explaining adoption and same-sex families to children is tricky, but this book was a great introduction.  Cute, cute, cute!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|\\"The Hunger Games\\" does not only accomplish the characteristic of action, but also romance, thrill, suspense, and cliff-hanging! This book is worth the read, and will surely have you on the edge of your seat!
B007H1HQW0|3.0|This bottle cutter does cut bottles. However, I can't seem to make it cut the bottles on the score line. I even watched a few videos on how to do it, but my bottles seem to crack unevenly. It does get the bottle to cut though.
B004HX4RT6|4.0|The game is pretty tough but still fun to play.  The different modes that you can play are a good feature.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|this is a great game. it just like bejeweled. but a funner not really wanting. to pay fornit but free is cool.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I don't play games much, but I like this one when I feel like burning a few minutes.  I also like that I don't have to race against the clock unless I want to.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|I was excited about seeing this movie when i saw the previews. Buy after seeing it i felt let down. The animation was great and the story was good, but it just felt like it was lacking something. I didn't feel a connection with the characters and it moved a little slow. I would recommend this movie to others, but i personally can't give it more than 3 stars.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|Entertaining, easy to read for the most part, but for those with absolutely no finance background, no worries, the  author makes the connections and definitions for you as much as possible.
B001P06GX4|5.0|The is my favorite game to play with my 3 and 5 year old. The first few times we played I had to remind the 3 year old only to touch corners not sides as is the point of this game. After playing about 4 times he has is down completely and doesn't need reminders about the rules. My older son 5 has surprised me by now understanding the blocking the other players strategy! He is becoming ruthless, in a fun way though. He really understands the concept.<br /><br />HANDICAP to make it competative for YOUNG children:<br />1) Allow them to take a certain number of turns before you are allowed to play. I now give them 3 turns and then I start. Initially we gave them about 5 turns each and then we would start.<br />2) I they start to get \\"stuck\\" and can not see a move for themselves I give them a little hint such as what if you try this piece in this area. Can it go there?<br /><br />For us it has worked out fine with 3 or 4 people but I understand how its much more challanging and fun with 4 but would suggest as others have just block off some of the board with less players.<br /><br />The last game we played my 3 year old beat me, I came in second, and my older son came in last. (and yes I was trying!)<br /><br />We have a bunch of educational games and I feel this is the most fun and very educational: the critical thinking, rule following, spacial awareness, etc.
B00979CS50|5.0|Neil young is an artist that has proven to be both excellent as well as mediocre at times. He is one of the few survivors from the 60's who has been able to renew himself completely many times. While some of his early stuff was somewhat to hippy-ish for my tastes, ever since tonight' s the night he has been able to surprise me quite a bit. The last excellent album he delivered was Le noise. While this one is maybe not as innovative it is stronger overall. It is also a lot more listenable. It manages to fuse the heavy guitars that he uses within crazy sore with a more poetic lyricism. It is surprisingly good, especially the first long song driftin back. Then the rest over the 2 CDs has the same level. It iS one of the records of the year.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Got for my grandson when he vists and I have been playing it since.  Oh by the way, he loves it to.
B007RTAR64|5.0|My daughter loves this one, it is a very resistant toy and my daughter plays with her a lot.  I recomend this one.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love both Star Wars and Angry Birds- great idea for the developers bringing together these two ideas into one great product.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|I have nothing but good to say it was a awesome family movie and is looking forward to buying it soon
B00846TTDG|5.0|This was one of the best movies I have ever seen. Our SEAL's are INCREDIBLE and this movie made my heart and soul feel Proud, HONOR, and MOVING. You are the BEST in more ways then one. God Bless All Of Our Military/SEAL's!!!
B008SVS3FC|4.0|I absolutely love John Hiatt. Looking at my CD collection, of all the artists that I have albums by, I have the most by Hiatt ... by far. In fact, I think I'm only missing one of his old Geffen albums and the first two studio efforts, although I have a Raven compilation with most of that stuff on it anyway. So, yeah, I'm a big fan of this guy. He is amazingly, impressively consistent with his albums. But for some reason, this new one took many, more than a dozen, listens, before the hooks set and it all finally clicked for me. What can I say: blame it on the rain! In any case, this is \\"typical\\" John Hiatt; well-written songs with pathos and humor and tenderness. Lyrics that make you smile and sigh and laugh and cry. Sheer brilliance as usual. Maybe this won't be your favorite John Hiatt album --- and I'm not even sure if it ranks in my Top 5 --- but it's another very good one and sure to satisfy his longtime fans.
B00526ZKYS|4.0|This book is definitely a wonderful read. It has some philosophical depth within it's young, naive love story. There was just a bit too much flourishing detail at times that took away from what was actually going on, but overall the book keeps a driving force that pushes you to read continuously.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I chose this book because I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's books. The Kay Scarpetta books are the best of her collection - and this is one of her Scarpetta books!  Never a dull moment in this book, plenty of suspense, action and true to life situations. A great read for both men and women.  I will recommend all her books to my friends.
B009LROCJI|5.0|I heard Max Richter talk about this album in an interview with NPR. I was messmerized by the short snippets and had to check out more. I purchased the whole album in MP3 format and am not disappointed. His recomposition is masterful.
B00129H7VS|5.0|I haven't had a chance to see this yet, but have heard many wonderful things about it. I read one of the companion books and it will be interesting to see this time in history come alive as we've never seen it before.
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|This is a disturbingn story. The author's writing kept me engaged from the beginning. Don't read this book if you worry about your parenting struggles.
B003L77GG0|5.0|Smallville is one of my most favorite series of all time. I loved what they did with the Superman icon and it helped bring a lot of questions to a close that the movies could never do. The 10th season also was greatly inspiring and a smooth transition to the hero we have all come to love in the comic books and movies.
B0090YHSFC|5.0|Thjis is an addictive little game that gets progressively harder, but does not become impossible. Good practice for your swiping technique.
0345803485|4.0|It's a good book. It took a little bit of getting used to it since its not a typical love story. There's pretty much a descriptive intimate scene every other chapter.
0307749347|5.0|Excellent life tutorial.  Practical and important lessons in dealing with, relating to and enjoying life.  Changes your thinking and helps you to formulate a new paradigm.
B00005J6UP|5.0|I have heard my husband talk about this movie so much! He loves it, and I know he will be excited when he gets it on Christmas. Thank you for getting it to me so fast.
B009VB97EY|4.0|My wife obviously enjoyed Magic Mike quite a bit, but I was surprised how much I liked it too. It's a funny movie with a genuinely likable male stripper lead character played by Channing Tatum. He can really move!  Matthew McConnaughey is great in it too. Both actors prove that they should focus on comedy I'm the future.
B001LX2J22|4.0|I saw the Red Dragon in the theaters when it came out.  Anthony Hopkins does an excellent job enough to chill you to the bone!
B0098VYCCE|2.0|This movie starts in a dark and grimy fashion and it seems to end there.  Snow White and her Huntsman have zero chemistry, making for a strange and awkward fairy tale ending, which is fitting for a Kristen Stewart movie. The Huntsman actor is much better as Thor. The dwarves are not menacing or cheerful, just very weird.  Not worth the purchase or rental price.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is fun and addictive. it isn't difficult to learn but it takes time to master. this is a fun one whether you have a few minutes or a few hours.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|First, the story is complete silliness, even for a superhero movie, but its so fun that I didn't care.  The Hulk is a great addition to the modern Marvel movie line up.  Captain America makes much more sense as a character now that he is surrounded by much stronger heroes; it is now clear that being brave despite a lack of special powers that makes him the leader. I really disliked his solo movie, so this was a nice surprise.<br /><br />From a technical standpoint, the 3d is great and the sound is amazing. The 3d adds depth without that in your face style that can cause headaches.  Plus you get the 2d regular blu ray, a DVD, and a digital copy. I was surprised to find that I received a code for the movie soundtrack as well.<br /><br />My only complaint beyond the silly bad guys was that the Hulk should have come out to play sooner in the movie!
B009POCG2C|1.0|I have not received this movie yet, so am suprised it is available to me for review. I am looking forward to getting it however...we love Clint Eastwood movies...
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|From what I can tell, those who have not read the book prior to seeing the movie seem to enjoy the movie most. I thought Jennifer Lawrence was great, but the actor playing Peeta seemed too small to have the strength credited to him. The movie tries to be a visual retelling of the book, which never works well as everything just feels rushed and without substance as a result.
B005MMY5RK|5.0|I did not think I would enjoy the movie as much as I did. I had to watch it for a film class I had to take and I loved it,
B007SGLZP8|4.0|In the Racketeer, Grisham puts together a interesting spin on a complex mystery. He takes an predictable plot and spices it up leading to a great ending.
B002L9N4DS|5.0|Very nice blue ray to an iconic film. Filled with spectacular special features which gives an in depth look to the creation of the movie.
B008458O3S|4.0|The puzzles range from basic (teaching the game mechanics) to challenging (I confess I looked up a solution for one of them). If you're a whiz at puzzles you may find it a bit easy, but it took me about 10 hours to complete them all. The solutions are also fun to watch in fast motion. I would have given it 5 stars, but it did occasionally freeze on the boot screen (Sprint Galaxy S).
B00873GK60|5.0|The steel book is very nice and worth the pick up to a great film. No inside artwork, but it's no real big deal to a fantastic packaging.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Best season of TV I've seen in a long time.  Captivating, intriguing, and exciting.  This show is definitely worth checking out.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|A very thought provoking story. Fun to read and more fun to think about. Can't wait to see the movie!
B003SFRBQ0|5.0|This is sure to be one of my  favorites;  The hardest decision is where to leave it.<br />In my car?  Or in my home cd player.
B008NB0SQO|4.0|This is a surprise - a good one that works very well for both adult audiences as well as for children.  Try it, you'll like it.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|Very entertaining. The ugly bear is little scary for the little ones but he's only in a small part of the movie. Great Overall.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I couldn't put this book down once I started it.  The characters were so real that I could truly envision what they looked like.  I stayed up to the wee hours of the morning to finish it because I couldn't wait to find out Lavinia's fate.
B005HNMPBM|5.0|This is a great movie I highly recommend.  It is true quality. And the cast is top notch.  Along with the plot.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I purchased the game for my grandchildren.  They love it! It is their favorite Angry Bird game.  They love the new powers the birds have in this game!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My son got me started on this game and once you start you just want to keep going!  It is very addicting:)
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|If you bought her first album and liked it, you will want this one.  &#34;Ride&#34; is a wonderful song.  Plus you will love &#34;bel air&#34;, and Blue velvet.
B0049J3QF4|1.0|We watched the first ten minutes of this cacophonous drivel and then switched it off.  Our daughter didn't even object.  Compared with the ingenuity of Aardman's Pirates and Arthur Christmas Disney and Pixar are starting to slouch.  Shamefully bad.
B002AOWXQ8|5.0|This album makes me want to gather 26 of my closest friends and drive cross country in a VW bus. We won't shower. Or shave. Or listen to anything but this album.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this game. My wife & I both play it with our grandson,  even when we're away from home.
B007XF4J70|5.0|One of the greatest movies of all time.  A true classic.  This movie can be watched over and over.  Humphrey Bogart is one of my favorite actors.  This movie has romance and it has some action scenes with some of the best actors, including Bergman, Claude Rains and others.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|Great to see all my favorite stars all together. I do wish Van Dam was on the good guy side.
B002RXZF6C|4.0|Before the DVD, I watched this movie a long time ago.  I enjoyed it more this time.  To label this a horror movie may not be correct.  Frankenstein is not like today's blood and guts horror movies.  I think I read a review that said it is not scary and it was therefore given two stars, if I recall correctly.  Being a black and white movie helps give a eerie feeling.  In close-ups of the monster's face, Boris Karloff's eyes looked creepy and inhuman.  And, the scene with the little girl is terrific.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Just received the DVD. Saw reviews on TV some time ago, finally had a chance to order and watcg the movie. Excellent movie. Great sound affects.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|Kept me engaged and eager to read more. Great addition to Delirium I can't wait until the next one is out!
B003WKOU0G|5.0|This movie combines four babies from different part of the earth.<br />I love the interesting things happened in their lives.<br />Good movie...
B009WO7NQO|2.0|not worth the money. I have the other 4 and dont need to spend as much. the ipod is cheaper and better.<br />_
B007L6VR12|3.0|I did not like the part when the little dog died.  The movie could have done without that. But a really great movie overall.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|American Horror Story Season 2 is worth watching and getting it on Amazon Prime at my convenience makes it even better!
B009FOBMBI|5.0|3 days grace....always been a good band, but this album, puts them at the top of the rock genre. original, outstanding beats and riffs, and the majority of the songs will get you fired up!  i listen to the entire album over and over, and i cant say that for very many other artists now a days, rock or any genre.
0385535147|5.0|I've read 99% of all books written by Grisham; although over the years, I'm beginning to forget the stories of some of them.  This is another great one.  I thought i had the plot figured out the whole time and was pleasantly surprised to find i was wrong :)  Great book!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I'm not crazy about the layout and the colors are limited but other then that it's fun. I love card games and you can't beat solitaire.
B000ME5B30|5.0|A very informative and powerful documentary.  A must watch.  I wonder what this country would have looked like if Al Gore was President in 2000.
B005ZUR724|3.0|I'm a recovering WoW addict, and questing is my favorite part.  O&amp;C scratches that itch pretty nicely, and it's an added bonus that I can play it on my tablet and smart phone.  :-)  I just wish it would stop freezing up on me, then it would be almost perfect.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Great game, better than the original angry bird. The only bad thing is that the same game is repeated in all the levels.
B004Z7AHZC|5.0|Grandkids love This Series of Wimpy Kid, so I knew that I couldn't go wrong buying this for them. To my Surprise I loved it also!
B004VMUS9G|4.0|My Kindle Fire goes almost everywhere with me and with this app, Alarm Clock Xtreme, it serves as a watch, appointment reminder and an alarm clock. I've had this app for 3 weeks now, and use it so very much.<br /><br />Great &#34;purchase&#34; considering it's free. I'd do it again on other devices.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Love playing this game to relax. The graphics are great and I would  buy more like this for my Kindle Fire HD.
B009CG2YDE|1.0|On this game you cant even move it sucks. do not get it. if you are thinking of getting this game think again.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Got this because my Grandkids said I would like it. Well THEY were Right. Keeps be feeling like a kid again and I'm 66.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app gets the job done. I dont have any complaints. It has been reliable and easy to navigate so far.
B00006C7G9|5.0|I bought this as a christmas gift for my dad and i was happy to find this in VHS format as he still has his VCR.<br />I really like the way it is packaged.
B000002GWN|5.0|The thing that is so great about Joni is even if you know all these songs like a great jazz musician she reinvites herself. A great.live outing with the wonderful LA Express and Tom Scott. I always considered Joni a jazz singer, if you are into lables. This outing covers Joni's songs so far, great song writer if you really want to see how good she pick up Herbie Hancock's River the Joni Letters. You camn't go wrong with Joni.
B002DD67XG|5.0|Great choice of his hits from a large selection. I couldn't of chosen any better myself. It is good mood music.
0547884591|3.0|Overall this is a great book but it wasn't as good as I thought it would be. If you are considering whether you should buy the book, buy it. Get the hardcover version.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|wish u could earn cash instead of having to buy it other than that fun to play glad i found it in the apps
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Ilike to be able to check the weather in my home town when I am in arizona for the winter.  Having the app on my kindle makes it more portable than on the computer
0143039881|5.0|When you read this book, and please do as I think everyone should, please read it while asking yourself does the behavior of the Nazi's, the Germans and the Jews toward the extermination of so many people parrot the behavior of our societies now in respect to the death of millions each year to starvation, to those that die here in the USA due to inadequate health care and poverty, to the destruction of the world through resource extraction and global warming or the murdering of billions of sentient beings in the taking of animals to eat.  This is a very powerful book whose message is alive today as during the trials in the 60's.
B0014D6PCO|1.0|I love the movie, but it kept freezing constantly so I couldn't really be happy with it. I got more frustrated watching it than just enjoying the movie.
B008CJ0KBU|5.0|Love this show...couldn't wait to get it on DVD.<br />Have watched it several times since I've gotten it.<br />Awaiting the arrival of Season Two
B000OV85AW|5.0|I first saw this film when I was a child, as I was really moved by it!  Dustin Hoffman has always been a favorite actor of mine, and I think this is one of his best movies to date!  Steve McQueen also does an excellent job in this film!  I highly recommend it!!!
B009LL4LMM|4.0|I figured out right away that this one probably wasn't made for my age group (62.)  That doesn't mean that it wasn't fun.<br />I found all of the levels were more or less challenging, and always fun and interesting.<br />I would have given it five stars if the game had more levels, and was a little harder.<br /><br />Get it and enjoy, I recommend it for all ages, especially younger puzzlers.
B004GYY714|5.0|I love this app.  All of my favorite stations are here, from r&b to the BBC.  I found a fantastic Christmas station.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|My grand daughter enjoyed it. Read it in a week. I love the kindle books but do not like having to wright this mandertory review !
B00314VYNE|5.0|Jessie is really cuter than I thought it would be.My 5 year old granddaughter loves it. she likes to sleep with her.
B00A4SJ61W|5.0|Even seeing it the second time with a 9-year-old grand daughter who loved it, I laughed out loud several times.  It is remarkably clever.
B007EDCWHA|5.0|This is the perfect book for any Directioner, young or old! Written by the boys themselves, this is a detailed look at their life as one of the most popular boy bands today Also includes a Fast Facts section, lots of pictures, and so much more. One of my favorite reads this year.
B009WO7NQO|2.0|I LOVE Angry Birds.  I have always gotten the free games, until now.  I don't mind paying a few bucks for a game, but then I expect to have the WHOLE game, not just the first few levels.  To complete the game, I will have to pay for more levels.  Also, I got 5 nifty torpedo spaceships.  When I had used them up, I got a message that I could get more for $1.99!  The game has great graphics and is fun to play, but I don't recommend it.  The original, free game is just as much fun.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is addictive and fun. It starts off easy enough to get you hooked then becomes difficult enough to drive you nuts!
B009SQQRH2|5.0|The grand kids couldn't stop watching it. They are 10,10 and 7 and loved it. Did not stop, even for popcorn!
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I needed it for music for our church choir.  It is exactly what I needed to use with The Planning Center.
B00846TTDG|4.0|This movie leaves a big impact on what some of these special forces type units do on a day to day basis and how that affects their hoem lives as well.  Very moving movie but NOT for kids!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is amazing.  It makes you think and use strategies.  Game was purchased by 3 boys between the ages of 10 to 14.  They play it avidly and really enjoy it.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|If you have ever uttered those words while reaching for someone's head you will love this game.  Even if not you will most likely love it too.  Gameplay is super simple so you will be able to pull in non gamers.  Roll dice, don't get shot, eat 13 brains, win.  That simple and replayable.
B007ZRZF8I|2.0|The guys goes really fast but it has slow reaction time to touch.  We barely even play.  Glad it was free.
B00319ECGK|5.0|This movie is stylish and beautiful.  If you don't have it in your Blu-ray collection add it now.  Every movie made for about three years copies elements of this film.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|A Fantastic movie, one of my absolute favorites. Highly recommended! It's on my DVR and I bought it as well for my family.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|epic, scary, dramatic, funny great fx. great charachter development. love the realtime app with the current episode cant wait till the next episode!!
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|If you are even close to being a fan of the \\"Alien\\" films, particularly the first one, you may enjoy this.  There's a lot of good and not so great features to this 4-Disc Collector's Edition.  The look of the film is pure Ridley Scott with the graphics, colors and moods.  One thing is certain.  Scott did not scrimp on sets, but the story could have been pulled together a bit better.  The story-line will satisfy an average film goer, but if you are into plot, you'll find a lot of holes here.  To add to that, there is NO \\"Director's Cut\\" of this film!  That's blasphemy!<br /><br />The 3D special effects are, however, phenomenal. I saw the film is a theater and the effects are not overused and there are no blurry edge spots or gratuitous things flying in your face.  If you could simply see the scene where the universe is shown in 3D with see-through holograms slowly moving around each other, with a character is the center, you'd be amazed.  That in itself is worth the film.  But a home theater 3D system is very expensive.  Still it is worth it.<br /><br />So what's in the box?<br /><br />The first disc is the 3D version and as a collector, I like having it even though I know no one with a system that can play it.  There is no price difference between the collector's set.<br /><br />The second disc is the actual film as it was shown in the theater.  It also includes the options of commentaries by Ridley Scott and the two writers, Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof.  They explain the manic writing force that drove them and how Scott took their vision and `corrected' it over and over.  They didn't seem to mind.  Here is an interesting quote:  \\"That is very much in tune with the movie that Ridley wanted to make, which is, \\"This is what happens when mankind is silly enough to think they can go and ask God questions.\\" First off, God might not necessarily be interested in answering you, but even worse than that, you might just set him off just for the act of trying\\".<br /><br />The Deleted and Alternate Scenes are what fill in the plot holes.  Ever wonder why Guy Pearce is only shown as an older Weyland?  There is a huge scene as a young man here that completely (almost) explains why this expedition took place.  It was not exactly the archeologist's idea alone.  The alternate beginning and endings really are simply extended versions of what you already see in the main film.  Scott's explanation for the plot holes and some of the placement of certain scenes was more for pacing the film than explaining the plot.  That's a tough trade-off.<br /><br />You also get the film in English DTS 7.1, English Descriptive Audio 5.1, Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1, French Dolby Digital 5.1 and subtitles in English and Spanish.<br /><br />The third disc is more extras, including `The Making of Prometheus Documentary\\", which is kind of fun to watch once.  There is also the Production Galleries and featurettes called the \\"Weyland Corp. Archives\\", which are extensive.<br /><br />The fourth disc is your `digital copy' and the Standard Definition of the film.  There is also a \\"Prometheus\\" for Portable Media Players.<br /><br />In summary, you could say that the film is gorgeous to look at (especially 3D), but the plot is pure Swiss-cheese, even with the extras that seem to pull the story together more.  There will be at least one more sequel to this prequel and probably more than that.  I'm happy I purchased it, as the price is right, but try not to be too picky.  Just enjoy it.he Deleted and Alternate Scenes are what fill in the plot holes.  Ever wonder why Guy Pearce is only shown as an older Weyland?

0525958002|5.0|Duran Duran was my first known music love.  I had an older family friend who loved them in their heyday in the mid 80s, I was too young to know what was really going on, but she (and DD) intotroduced me to true fan mania which has not settled down even as I creep towards middle age.  Ha ha ha ...  Reading this book brought out many a memory.  You'll laugh, you'll cry, it will become a part of you for all the fans out there.<br /><br />John Taylor was born Nigel John Taylor, a rather nerdy kid who wore glasses and was the only child of two Catholic parents.  The Beatles happened when he was a kid, and then he met Nick Rhodes when they were about 11.  They eventually went to a place called The Rum Runner in their teens, met Roger Taylor from the scene.  Andy Taylor answered an ad in a newspaper for a guitar player, and then Simon Le Bon came in in his purple leopard skin pants.  And then there were five, and that was the beginning.  Their rise to the top was almost too crazy to be believed, and how John came crashing down was also hard to believe.<br /><br />Duran Duran, without question, has had an unusual career.  They went from teen idols who were not taken very seriously to a truly respected phenomenon based on their longevity, their changes and maturity levels.  Suddenly the girls were not screaming for them anymore, the audience was actually listening to them.  And continues to listen to them.  And they deserve the credit, they truly earned it while so many burn out or fade away.  We respect them today for their tenacity.  John, however, got sucked into something that we have all been down.  Even other members of Duran Duran did not realize until fairly recently what a mess he really was and how lucky he is to be alive.<br /><br />What spoke to me the most is the illusion that you are cool when you are actually not.  You spend all those years being this somewhat awkward, nerdy kid who didn't get a second glance from others, and then suddenly you're cool.  When you used to be greatful for every crumb of attention you got, you then get all that you ever wanted.  With just a wink and nod, you could have any man/woman you wanted, and they are all too eager to share it with you when you felt others could care less about you.  You weren't cool enough, but now you are all of a sudden.  With that comes arrogance, pride, self assuredness - and with it also comes a fall.  And John fell down with his addictions, which we all have.  Some of us wake up and see the light, but John had to go to rehab to get it out of him.  Feelings of insecurity, shame, not wanting to change, not seeing the truth of the matter gets in the way, but John overcame it.<br /><br />Andy Taylor also wrote a book about Duran Duran and his years with John in Power Station, their side project.  John doesn't mention as much about this as I thought he would, because in the end while it helped them grow with their skills, it hurt Duran Duran.  Comparison is always there between this and Andy's book, for a better story of the Power Station experience read Andy's.<br /><br />And of course, we all wanted him to kiss and tell, but he didn't really.  He mentioned the time that he realized he had caught crabs (YUCK!) in the shower and telling his father about it.  \\"We won't mention that to your mother, son.\\"  The double standard if he was a woman would be overwhelming.  Ha ha ha ...  In Andy's book, there was a reference to some woman he spent a lost weekend with in Paris who sold the naughty photos they took of each other and her story to a tabloid of their romp.  What does that get you?  Not much really, for either party, and it's pretty embarassing really.  This is why you don't kiss and tell: it's the past, it's memories, you move on from it.<br /><br />THis was a great read for all sorts of reasons, and it's wonderful to see he's sober, working hard, and happy.

B0013F1D02|5.0|I purchased this movie because I was bored and had a crush on the lead who was also on Boardwalk Empire and ended up being thoroughly entertained.  I have no idea why this movie didn't get as much attention and how I didn't know about it earlier. Fun cast, Claire Danes is great too, and Deniro has a really fun role. I would recommend to anyone!
B000T433CO|5.0|This is a story for those of us that still believe that you can find love, even after a bad, bad experience.  It is about 2 women that live on different sides of the world and try to do something different in order to find happiness.  I love this movie!!!

B007TK77QE|5.0|one amazon reviewer questioned what had happened to Ms Rowling to make her hate humanity and write about characters who have no redemptive qualities.<br /><br />she must have read a different novel. or missed the point.<br /><br />Ms Rowling presents us with a outstanding plot (not surprising given her history) and characters who on the face of it are unlikable and often utterly repellent.  through her interwoven narrative Rowling reveals the motivating force behind her creations, in an attempt to show us their humanity, a humanity others may choose not to see.<br /><br />THAT was the point
B006LSZECO|1.0|I was so bored I had trouble finishing the book.  This book held little mystery and no plot.  It was a character analysis of two extremely narcissistic, immature and selfish individuals.  I didn't care what happened to either one.  If I had had the option, I would have given the book zero stars.  I haven't disliked a book this much since Bonfire of the Vanities.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book was exactly what I expected it to be. I picked it up on Kindle because all the ladies at work were speaking about it. For those readers looking to find some kind of revelation within the pages of Fifty Shades and are disappointed I say too bad. I found the book to be simple fantasy. It was a quick read and filled with some passionate and racy scenes. I will never read this book again but I am not regretful. The faults I found were that the characters seemed \\"off\\". I could not relate to a young woman who was so conflicted over the choice of being with \\"the man I love\\" vs. not! While this is sexual fantasy, why should the male character be so young. [Spoiler]<br />While he may have experienced something when he was four years old I just can't believe that he'd be this experienced billionaire so young. [End of Spoiler]<br />I read books like these and with the use of my own imagination and sometimes reinterpretation I find myself enjoying it in the moment far more than I actually do after putting it down. It's not to say I didn't like it but that it's just okay.
0525952926|5.0|Just finished book two of the trilogy.  Now, I can't wait for the third and final book.  I love Follett's style of writing and the stories are educational and interesting.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|If you are looking at this book, you already are familiar with the others in the Percy Jackson series.  The one thing you are interested in is &#34;is this one as good as the ones before it?&#34;  The answer is that I actually found it better than the last two previous books.  This has all of your favorite characters and balances the stories of each very well.  A great edition to the continuing story.
078322804X|4.0|The Blues Brothers is one of my all time favorite films. Appearances by Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, James Brown , john Lee Hooker and cameo appearances by Joe Walsh and Chaka Kahn add to the appeal.<br />I had to add the DVD to my collection.<br />I like the scenes that were scooped up from the cutting room floor and added to this version of the film.<br />I was a little disappointed that there were no significant bonus features like interviews of the actors decades following the film's release.
B0052AC8C6|3.0|A grotesque environmental Western Music Man piece. Of course what do you expect from anything Johnny Depp stars in? It was just. Weird.

0547884591|5.0|This third book in the \\"4 Hour\\" series stands alone but ties in well with the previous two.  For reading purposes, I have had the Kindle version in hand much of the past several days and find it difficult to put down (my wife has an easier time setting the hardbound copy I boght for her aside due to its weight, but she is enjoying the content).<br />I am excited to apply the lessons to cooking- my wife and I are both proficient in the kitchen, but are always interested in experimenting and learning new techniques- and to many other areas of life from language to flying aircraft and beyond.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I am an avid reader but few authors keep me on my toes while making me laugh out loud...  When is the next book coming out ?
B004OBQDHK|1.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE! Waited for it to come out on Blu-ray and was really looking forward to seeing this in HD, but unfortunately the quality is only DVD quality, so a waste to buy it on Blu-ray if you already have it on DVD. (viewed on a 60\\" HDTV)
B007VTVGAQ|2.0|I have always enjoyed Fiona's lyrics but they were always driven by a powerful musical<br />base. This album seems to take her down to the bare minimum and for me it does not work. All the powerful beats, percussion, break downs and build ups are gone. It just sounds like a sad person at a piano. Left alone is the only song that sounded like she has a band and I enjoyed it, however brief. Everything sounds like Sullen Girl or Slow Like Honey. Just slow and simple all the way through.<br />Her first two albums sounded like a bitter powerful woman beating you senseless with<br />her lyrics, piano and her band. I wish she would have kept the band.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Fun game until it starts to either freeze up or move really slow. Then I miss numbers and don't get as many numbers as I probably should.

B0063GORYU|5.0|I like the game because it makes me use my brain and<br />I can also use the hints if I get stuck.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|The first book was great and this book continues. You will not be disappointed. GRRM really goes further into character development and there are additional point of views introduced.

B000FBFN1U|5.0|This is my favorite book of the series so far. I have read all five. The fifth book is great too. This book seems to really conclude a lot of the major issues that were developed in the first two books. The second half of the book will take you only days to read. You will not want to put it down.
B000H0Y0CM|5.0|Muscles and Brief Clothes. Wizards, Warriors, Both Female and Male. A YOUNG Brigette Neilson. AND YOUNG Arnold Schwarzenegger. Queens and Lovers. Sword Fights. What could be more Corny Fun than that. For a Sword and Sorcery movie it is a pretty good concept, but mostly it is fun. A few issues meant for the older crowd among us watching. But really they don't dwell in them for very long. It a race against time kinda movie. AND everyone must remember the very talented karate kid named Ernie.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|This book is a good continuation. Probably my least favorite of the five but it is really a set up for the fifth book. I did like the new point of views.
B00190OHD6|5.0|Love Love Love this movie. One of my all-time favorites. It is such a well written film and a beautiful love story.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Forcing me to sign in and reload books daily. Amazon saids its a issue with the Galaxy S3 with Jelly Bean, with no idea of a fix.

B00003CY6M|5.0|I was talking to someone about this movie and i was like &#34; I need this in my collection.&#34; I looked all over for it and saw it here. There response on the shipment was good and the CD was in GREAT condition. Thanks
B000093BDX|2.0|I think the audio here is really bad. Now it maybe simply my playback system in the car;but these guys are much better than this disc suggests
B005LAIIRQ|1.0|I watched the trailer and it looked good but it was a complete let down the movie plot was really sketchy and the ending was the worst EVER!!!!
0399157565|1.0|Whew...just finished reading the hardback version of \\"The Bone Yard\\" and I am exhausted.  I am also angry at myself for wasting precious time reading this book, hoping against hope that somewhere, somehow, the real Scarpetta would show up.  But no, she is MIA in \\"The Bone Yard\\" just as she has been in the last four or five books in this series.<br /><br />Truth in advertising on the book jacket should have noted that once again we'll read about the whining Kay with her stream of consciousness dialogue and ever increasing insecurities, the stilted Benton, the feckless Marino and super renegade Lucy.<br /><br />Other reviewers have noted the major flaws in this book and the more recent additions to the series.  What bugs me is Cornwell's incredible overuse of the compound sentence.  An example on page 93 when describing the leatherback turtle is:  \\"It is cool and smooth as petrified bone, and I feel him slowly, heavily stir.  I'm constantly aware of where his jaws are in relation to me, and I hear the blasts of his respiration....\\".  Another example on page 105:  \\"I surface for air and dive again, and the way she's rigged is grotesque and sinister.\\"  For me, this writing technique so disturbed any flow to the narrative, it felt like hiccups during a funeral service.<br /><br />I can't see a future for Scarpetta, who has deteriorated into a jealous wife, a doubtful boss, and an all around unlikeable character.  Honestly, I don't think anyone cares any longer about her.  The time has come to let her RIP in \\"The Bone Bed\\".  I gave this book one star.
0425263916|5.0|EXCELLENT!!!!  A PAGER TURNER!! CAN'T WAIT FOR MAY !!  I really hope the final book will be published and out before May.  The wait is killing me.  I've read this book three times since I've purchased it.
1878424114|5.0|For the new Chopra reader, and anyone at the beginning of their life journey.  Easy to read, small chapters every night, with timeless/priceless wisdom.  Have bought three to give to others and read it four times in my life, including one time to my teen.

B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|what a lot of fun for the whole family.  my son, wife, two daughters, and I loved this movie.  On Amazon prime it was a two day rental.  the kids watched it twice.  If you're Irish or Scottish you'll get a big kick out of the movie.  it's like the cartoon version of Braveheart.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Excellent app, it works very well on Kindle Fire, just like on the iPad. The ease of downloading the app was great!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I am on the second season at this point and am anxious for Season 3.  The series is keeping me on the edge of my seat. The characters are so interesting.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Update: I was considering buying this season a second time.  I originally bought it in November 2012 when it became available in the U.K. and then was very angry when I watched it on PBS in January 2013 to find that there were many additional scenes in Episodes 3, 4, 5 & 6 being shown on PBS.  I felt cheated. However, after reading several comments on one of the reviews here it appears that this DVD offering is no better than that I purchased from Amazon.com/uk.  Why there should be additional scenes shown on PBS and not included in the DVD versions is a mystery but many, many viewers are now aware of this discrepancy  and hopefully it will not happen again as the producers go forward with Season 4.<br /><br />This marvelous series gets better and better.  The guiding spirit that makes this production so much more wonderful than others is the fact that the creator, Julian Fellows, seems to have a benevolent view of life.  I haven't encountered this view since I last read the Brother Cadfael mysteries by Elllis Peters (Edith Pargeter).  Fellows has decided to show people at their very best - a most unusual approach to drama.  I think that this is the reason for Downton Abbey's world-wide success.  Dramatic contrast, which is necessary to keep our interest riveted on the characters, means that the Crawley family will continue to encounter adversity, but it is the way that they pull together that makes us care about them so deeply.  I received Season 3 about mid-November and have watched it every day since then.  It is glorious.<br /><br />I do have to complain that Fellows has gone off the rails once again (cf. the trial of John Bates) in the scene where Tom Branson is allegedly given a drink that makes him act oddly.  In fact: Branson, talking with Larry Gray, puts his cocktail glass down and walks away.  Larry puts something in Tom's glass.  Immediately thereafter dinner is announced and they all go in to dinner.  At that time, with before -dinner cocktails being avery new  phenomenon, people did not take their cocktails into dinner.  It's not like today when people are in a restaurant and take their cocktails from the bar to the dining room.  At that time wine was served with every course and everyone would have left their cocktails in the drawing room.  There was, therefore, no opportunity  for Tom to drink the doctored cocktail.  I think it is insulting that Fellows assumes that his viewers will not recognize the impossibility of these scenes.  The trial scenes were outrageous since there was no possible way for the prosecuting attorney to have knowledge of the events that Mrs. Hughes and Miss O'Brian were forced to testify to.  In Season 3 I was delighted to see that the resolution of Bates's situation was well thought out - logically and rationally and totally in character for everyone, so Julian Fellows can stay within the bounds of the possible when he wants to.  I wish he wanted to more often.  Why he allows his near-perfect series to be marred by these digressions into the impossible is a mystery to me.

B007TK77QE|4.0|JK Rowling's style and narrative skills are really enjoyable. This is a definite and dramatic shift from her usual target audience, i.e. children; which is really brave and worthy of praise. I know good things come at a price, however, some price reductions or promotions would be warmly welcome. At the end of the day, I acknowledge it is a matter of marketing and PR.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Merry Christmas, Baby is an awesome cd!! I love how Rod Stewart performs these classic Christmas songs. He also sings with a few other great performers on this cd as well. I would highly recommend Merry Christmas, Baby to all Rod Stewart fans and anyone else who loves listening to Christmas music!!

B008NB0SQO|1.0|I know a lot has been said about this, but I feel obligated to add one more warning to the pile. Please don't buy this edition of the film. It's missing \\"When Love Is Gone,\\" which is both the emotional climax of Michael Caine's performance, and the finest of Paul Williams's songs for the film.<br /><br />Digging through product listings and other peoples' reviews, it appears that you can either choose between having the film in its proper widescreen, or having the full running time of the movie, but either way, there's no way to buy the entire film as it was meant to be seen.<br /><br />The remaster for the Blu-Ray is beautiful. The detail is incredible; you can see the little bubbles in the foam on Gonzo's nose. But it's missing the four minutes that serve as the turning point. Caine's Scrooge goes from resentful to penitent and grateful, and you don't get to see that transition occur. You get a really awkward jump cut. The french horns and violins flirt with the melody, and swell up for the musical number, and then there's an abrupt cut to the end of the scene. Even if you'd never seen it before, you could tell that something was wrong.<br /><br />Anyway, long and short of it is, this is a great movie that deserves better, and there are no polite words to be said about this release.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|Great book. It's only 4 stars because it's not quite as great as the 5 star Orwellian dystopias it emulates. Well worth the price.

B007MU85D0|4.0|Solid album with 4 great songs. Definitely sounds similar to Arcade Fire and anyone that is fan of them will like Of Monsters and Men
B008WCP2PG|1.0|I've never wanted a movie to end this badly in a LONG time.<br />Lets start with Channing Tatum. He's beautiful. I found myself cracking a huge smile during his dance routines, especially to Ginuwine's Pony, I mean, for the few dance scenes he had in the movie HE delivered there. His acting??? Well, he's Channing Tatum, so we'll leave it at that.<br /><br />The choreographed group scenes... Your eyes are so fixed on tatum, that you barely notice the other guys, aside from Matt Bomer have ZERO rhythm or dancing skill to speak of. They should never dance again. Seriously, they look incredibly silly and uninspired. And most of the time I cringed and felt bad for them. (Then I remember they probably did this for a check, and my pity went away)<br /><br />McConaughey. His \\"accent\\" made me remember why I've never watched anything with him in it. Some of his other scenes were HIGHLY uncomfortable.<br /><br />\\"The Kid\\" I know of no woman who would pay to see him dance. Cute face, yes, everything else? No.<br /><br />The other \\"Dancers\\" ............... (Insert blank stare here)<br /><br />The plot. Basically everything that was not Channing Tatum dance scenes was dreadful filler. He wants to make CUSTOM. FURNITURE. OUT. OF. TRASH. THE END, really, that's all you need to know about one of the main reason this movie stunk. The person who wrote this should never be allowed to put pen to paper again. For the duration of their life.<br /><br />Oh, the \\"Love Interest\\". I don't know who the woman was who played the kid's sister. But I hope I never see another movie with her in it. Her facial expressions were like she spent the entire movie looking like she smelled someones fart. Seriously, EVERY scene was a scowl or this expressionless skeletor faced look. I don't get how or why she was cast in this movie. NOTHING likable about her.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend buying this, even renting at redbox. Watch it on Cable. Seriously. And you're welcome.
034580404X|4.0|I was so excited about the way the first book amazed me I bought the Trilogy.  I couldn't find the 2nd and 3rd alone since I had read the first volume.

B000HAB4KS|5.0|This is a great movie. I think by now everyone has seen it, if you haven't, check it out. I've since replaced this DVD with a bluray.
B0058YPL66|5.0|Remember, all magic comes with a price - Rumplestiltskin<br /><br />If you are tired of cop and reality shows-you should give Once Upon A Time a chance. This show is based on fairy tales and goes back and forth from the present time to a realm that is a rich land of fairy tale characters such as: Geppetto, Snow White, Pinnochio, Little Red Riding Hood & Grandma, fairies, the Seven Dwarfs and more. It took my daughters and I about four episodes before we got a handle on what was going on, but once we did, we were blown away!<br /><br />One bright and shining character is Rumplestiltskin/Mr. Gold, played brilliantly by Robert Carlyle. His multi-faceted character alone makes this show worth watching. All the characters are very good, but for me, this guy, brings it. I can't say enough good about him. As Mr. Gold he is great, as Rumplestiltskin he is superb.<br /><br />This show is very layered. We went back and watched the first 6 or 7 episodes and caught all kinds of things we missed the first time we watched. The main idea is this: Henry, an adoptive boy lives in Storybrook. He finds his birth mother, Emma Swan, and takes her back to Storybrook. His teacher has given him a book and in it he finds extraordinary comparisons to people who live in Storybrook. He therefore believes that the whole town is under a spell. His birth mother, Emma, he believes is the only one who can break the spell. The events in Storybrook, mirror the happenings in the fairytale land and Henry and the evil queen (his adoptive mother) are the only ones who really know (especially the queen/mayor of Storybrook) but memories are coming back to some of the characters with the arrival of Emma as the clock begins to tick. Time has actually stood still in Storybrook for 28 years.<br /><br />Anyway, some episodes are about a single character and their past and some are about Snow White and Prince Charming whose true love might just be the thing that can break the dark curse that hangs over the town. There is a lot to love about this show. It's original and the writing and acting is first rate. Also worth noting are the sets and costumes in fairytale land, they are amazing as is this fresh and special, entertaining series.There is a lot to love about this show.

B0084IG7KC|5.0|If you are a fan of the movie you will love the bluray. It's a really good tranfer to bluray, the sound and video are both great.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Wow! I have read many books in my life but this one is themost interesting and exciting, I am not an American so I was worried that I will have problems understanding it perfectly, but I am reading thisbooks without a translator as its written in a easy-to-read language. I recommend reading this book after you watch a tv show!
B0061QD82E|5.0|I hadn't seen this movie until we watched the bluray however it seems to be really good quality. It's a good story for the family. I would suggest getting the movie before it goes in the vault again.
B009LA1R34|4.0|Thalia has finally come into her own. Her voice has gotten stronger and her music choices are far more mature and personal. This album surpassed my expectations. It might disappoint those who are used to silly dance songs but if you open you ears, you might experience a potential pop classic.
B003DZX44I|5.0|If you can still get a copy of this movie I would highly suggest it. It's a great transfer and even if you don't have children or frequent young visitors, by time it comes back out of the vault again you probably will.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Wasn't aware of Muse until recently. Their music, particularly this one, Absolution, is catchy and intelligent, really grows on you. I like it better with each listen. Excuse the simplicity, but this is sort of like Radiohead + U2 combined with 1970's Queen and a little Arctic Monkeys or punk thrown in for good measure. But even better than Radiohead or U2 - which is saying a lot.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|It was great to see a strong female character who wasn't love struck. I highly recommend this movie with a great family message.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The book was incredible. Makes me wish I,was a demigod. :/ I can't wait for the fall of 2013. Every single book to do with Percy is amazing. I hope he never stops writing them! :)
B000FA5SMK|5.0|It kept me interested from the beginning to the end. Great book. I would recommend this to my friends. I'm going to look for more of his books to read.
B009LUBA7M|5.0|I knew I had to get this as soon as I saw Mika had a new album out. Be warned, though, there is a significant change in style on some of the tracks here. They aren't my favorite songs, but they have started to and will continue to grow on me.<br /><br />The Mika you know and love is still here. Complete with infectious lyrics, strong hooks, etc. You'll love this album if you loved his previous work.
B007REV4T8|4.0|As noted above, this is a terrific movie with many topics for discussion.  That's not something one can say about many Bond movies but issues of authority, the difficulties of being a spy, modern technology's limits, et al  certainly provide additional depth.  It's probably just as well not to think too hard about the plot, however, as there are some points you could drive a truck through....and that is done pretty often.  The athleticism of the stunts was incredible and the chase scenes remarkably destructive and just plain remarkable.  This is a return to the first Bond with Craig (after the disappointment of QUANTUM OF SOLACE) but with more issues and less sex.<br /><br />Here is a warning.  I saw it in IMAX and the sound was so loud that it was painful and unbearable.  Fortunately, I had ear plugs with me, which made it tolerable.  These plugs - from the drug store - remove the very loudest sounds,  leaving the music and the spoken words perfectly audible.  While the special effects are very special indeed and super-dramatic, I would have walked out because of the sound if I didn't have the plugs.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is a great puzzle game.  I love the challenge!  Once I start playing it, it's hard to put down - very addictive.  I highly recommend this game.
B009NUV0E8|4.0|Great movie that's finally on Blu-ray that's not packaged with all the other Bond movies, but I ordered it from Price Clock and they failed to detail that it was the French-Canadian version. It still works fine, but cosmetically, it for some reason especially annoys me, since it says &#34;L'ceil De Feu&#34; underneath the title. It's off putting to me, so I had to use a Sharpie to black out that part of the title on the side label, lol.
B0086700CM|5.0|My brother told me to review this game because hes arguing with me so... I Lii this game 4no apparent reason. peace poops:)
B0083P1QUM|1.0|This was sooooo bad that I would not recommend to anyone.  She spent so much time trying to educate us that the story was lost. Really, Really awful.  This is the last Cornwell book I will read (and I have read them all)
B009WO7NQO|5.0|How much better can you get in a Angry Birds game. More great birds and challenges. I cannot wait for the new levels.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This movie is visually spectacular. If you know anything about what it takes to computer generate hair and fur you will appreciate this artistic effort even more. I spent a lot of time watching Merida's curls.<br /><br />As for the story, It's about the age old struggle regarding family values, tradition, self fulfillment and the willingness to see the world through another's eyes.It's a coming of age story for not only the teenage protagonist Merida, but for all the people around her.<br /><br />In a way Disney is showing us how they are learning this lesson. They have been of the old belief that there must be a one-dimensional villain. Their latest collaborations with Pixar has prodded them to change this. Yes, there is a peripheral &#34;big bad monster&#34; but he is on the edges of the story and not a direct driver of the story.<br /><br />In this movie the village is obsessed with the fear and loathing of bears. Because of peculiar circumstance they learn that maybe bears aren't so bad after all. That's not the main story line but it is a lesson to think about.
B008A1B5Z0|4.0|Yes it does improve speed. Thanks Guys keep up the Good Work. Do not really understand the threshold setting, but ill check with friends and learn to use it.
B0098VXE50|3.0|This movie had me confused. It didn't know what it wanted to be. The only character that was clearly defined was the man-hating Queen.<br /><br />Snow White's companion was supposed to be devoted to her but at times had a mean streak. The evil forest was supposed to be so scary that the only man who had been there refused to return. Later on in the movie the Queen miraculously found a whole group of men willing to go into the forest. The dwarfs were no more than people with dwarfism; not the legendary fairy folk dwarfs who mined the mountains. They said this but I didn't see much evidence.<br /><br />Snow White was sometimes enchanted and sometimes not. The girl chosen to portray her as a child certainly did not have raven hair, fair skin or red lips. There was nothing to say that she was not just another ordinary child. As an adult she got limited help from the animals of the forest but was mostly on her own. Sometimes she was magic and sometimes not. She didn't seem to know her own destiny except to say once in a while that she was to be queen someday. Other than that she was a typical helpless movie female. She even meets a god-like animal but nothing really comes of it. I didn't get the locked in the tower for 10 years bit either. It seems the directors needed to fill in the gap between her childhood and adulthood so they just locked her out of sight in a tower until he story could resume.<br /><br />To sum it up, special effects okay, storyline, needs work.
B005LAIHSQ|4.0|This is why I only gave it four stars because I thought it was lacking in some places.<br />I rented this from the library:<br /><br /> It's supposed to be a modern day retelling of the Snow White and The Seven Dwarves) cartoon movie set to real action but it's too dark and too medieval for what they told in this version and I do like medieval stories because of the swords and weapons that they use, (I'm a big fan of swords) but a troll, really? an dthe names of the dwarves were all wrong (I think I counted 8 of them at one time and the one that died when he got the arrow in the back by the name of 'Gus' wasn't in the cartoon version, I was wondering how they made actor Bob Hoskins look so small (smaller than he is in real life as I saw him in Unleashed with Jet Li and I think he's only about 5 foot 5 inches in real life, but he looks even smaller here, I guess it's just a camera trick they use. I guess I just like the cartoon version better because it was so comical in it's telling of the fairy tale. And Chris Hemsworth did a pretty bang up job as the Huntsman but I don't see the correlation between this version and the disney cartoon one. Some of the special effects kept me wondering too and the evil queen's wardrobe was pretty cool. I see that they made the cover picture on the dvd of the queen a bit larger as if she's the main title character point for the movie. The scenery and locales were spectacular because I watched the extras on the disc and found out that they filmed parts in Stotland and South Wales, I've always wanted to hike through some of those areas of Scotland but they did say that it's freaking cold there in those parts they filmed in.<br /><br /> **I almost can't wait to see The Hobbit, coming soon.
B002DD67XG|5.0|The music was I remembered and quality of the download is very good as well.  The steaming through the cloud worked well with my network in my area.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a really fun ride with twists and turns and at the same time a story that underscores the confusion and innocence that are a part of all of us.
B009E3EY38|5.0|A must have for any Zep Head. I saw the movie in the theater but the quality doesn't compare to Blue Ray on a good home theater system. Jason Bonham was spectacular. Only disappointment is they didn't include Moby Dick featuring Jason on drums.
B0086700CM|5.0|I absolutely love this game it is so fun and challenging and you can never get bored with this game!!!!!
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|I like Ridley Scott and own many of his films but this was a disappointment. It has the feel that it was made from all the used parts of the Alien films and though there were a lot of visual effects the story and filming were not his best effort. My review means little amongst all these others but if you have seem the Alien films you will have already seen scenes like the big storm on an alien planet with folks trying to get back to the ship; the huge alien vessel like the one that was crashed in Alien; the pods people shouldn't touch but do so anyway; a creature growing inside someone; the huge multi-wheeled transport vehicle; creatures puncturing the glass visors on the helmets; pretty much the same type of crew members; everyone popping out of their sleep chambers and having the first meal together; a \\"hidden\\" agenda on the purpose of the trip; someone trying to bring something they shouldn't aboard their ship; only one survives and it's a scantily clad woman; the decapitated head of a robot that can still speak; and the list goes on. Prometheus seems to have been made from the parts of others and other than the unimportant visual scenes added as a distraction there was very little new here and I actually regret having purchased this before ever seeing the movie. I'm selling my copy of this movie.
B00993FEUK|5.0|Paranorman is on par with Coraine, as both have come from Laika studios and Henry Selick. Like Coraline, Paranorman is just a complete treasure. All the time put into this production is stunning. Coraline has become one of my all time favorite movies, and now Paranorman comes along and is just as memorable and original. I can not wait to get the Blu Ray so I can see this again, I am dying with anticipation. Lovers of Stop Motion will love this, it is just so amazing how it is done, and it is pure eye candy to watch the end result. Much like Frankenweenie which is stop motion, I have been so happy to see a few of these come out this year. It is just a lost art form that seems to only grace the screen every now and then. The first stop motion film I saw was A Nightmare Before Christmas, I saw this when I was just a kid and ever since I have been lost in the magic. Rejoice and I hope these keep coming!
B00003CY6M|5.0|Love the Christmas season....love love.  Great movie which I had already seen but wanted a copy of my own.<br />Very cute love story.
B001EC2IV2|5.0|Arnold's back and Vanessa's got him - protecting her that is. Arnold plays a federal marshal who protects Vanessa Williams from sell-out US government officials and a Russian mobster. They are aided by an appreciative Wise Guy and his cronies. Very good action picture with a plane sequence worth reviewing again and again.
B008GXHOFW|3.0|so I bought this and it was fly I had fun. then I go to open it in the morning and it crashes! OMG WTF
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is great when you just want to spend some idle time.  A very good but simple  brain exercise.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Huge fan of Son's of Anarchy, this HD format and the ability to watch without commercials is the way to go.
B006LSZECO|3.0|While the plot was intriguing, it didn't deliver at the end. The language was harsh - the &#34;F&#34; word not needed, didn't add to the characters and was offensive to me.
B008BYXQJY|4.0|Not as good as the last CD, this one is not as strong as the last couple they put out.
B0063IH60K|5.0|if you love solitaire you will love this on your kindle fire it is so much fun to play and it was free
B009WO7NQO|5.0|It is so fun and so cute, I can't wait for more.  From the storm trooper piggies to the Pig Star, just perfect
B009DKFSUA|4.0|Pitbull is a rapper who makes dance/club music. He is not going to make any introspective music or any music with social commentary. I keep that in mind when I listen to his music. On this new album, I was kind of shocked at the new direction he is taking. The songs on this album still have that fun, dancing vibe. But there are a few songs that are quite vulgar. On these songs, Pitbull suggests that it is okay for a woman to have a one night stand and he gets his point across bluntly. If I had a 12 year old daughter, there is no way I would let her listen to these songs.<br /><br />Also, Pitbull has changed his style to the now trendy electronic music. Not all of the songs have some electro-based music, but most of them do. He worked with Afrojack on a few of the songs. It mostly works as the songs are danceable. Not all of the songs are high tempo dance songs. A couple of songs (Drinks For You and Outta Nowhere) keep it slow and smooth. Both of these are good songs. Pitbull raps the most on Outta Nowhere and he actually does a pretty good job.<br /><br />Overall, if you like electronic-based dance music you shouldn't be disappointed. If you like more of the Latin-based, old school Pitbull music you might be turned off. It is a solid dance album, but there really aren't any songs that stick out that will become a Billboard hit.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|very good. lots of skip for the non puzzle experts. good story plot lots of twist to keep you intrigued. easy to stop and hold your spot yet remind you of where you left off.
B007JWKLMO|5.0|This is an in-depth and fascinating film that documents George Harrison's spiritual and musical journey. Must see, even for a non-Beatle fan.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|After angry birds we  needed bad piggies. Great time killer . One need to build vehicles for the piggies to get to the map- makes one to think also
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Had to watch all the episodes in a matter of days. Claire Danes is amazing in the lead. Must see!
B00005N6KG|2.0|I like how these work, but they need to be replaced every 2-to-3 months.  If they lasted longer, I would like them more.
B0099G3I96|5.0|I have been waiting for a new No Doubt album, and this one definitely satisfies!!  The title track is great!!!
B005HSL626|4.0|Really fun time waster. Occasional freeze problem but nothing to make me irritated. Among the top 3 games Ive downloaded.
B008458O3S|5.0|VERY addicting puzzle game.  Also very unique. I've never seen anything quite like it before.  Works flawlessly on my HTC Sensation.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Serves its purpose. No extra bells and whistle, it is what it is. That's all I have to say about it.
B00A3SGWYC|5.0|Listen,<br />To all the true Pitbull fans that really only play Pitbull when you're getting ready to go to the club, or on the way to the club, or AT the club... this CD lives up to the expectation.  This is feel good music, something that you would add to your marathon playlist or gym playlist... this CD will get you to run that extra mile.  Let me break it down a little further:<br /><br />Don't stop the Party, Feel this Moment w/ Christina, Hope we meet again w/ Chris Brown, Party Ain't over (disgusting beat), Have some fun, I'm off that... ALL FEEL GREAT MUSIC!!<br /><br />This CD is worth the $, add it to your Itunes.
B0098VXBIA|3.0|We watched it, we laughed and enjoyed it, but honestly, I can remember very little about this movie now that some time has passed. I do get tired of seeing Cameron Diaz always showing that her &#34;older&#34; body is still in good shape. I'm glad for her, but it gets a little tiresome. I did like all of the characters in this movie. Even the one I thought I wouldn't.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Freakin love this app and amazon is the best!  Woot.  I love how I can get gift cards for stuff I don't really need and it gives my gf something to do besides nag nag nag me ..<br /><br />Good job amazon!!
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Like Survivor without a choice. Although I feel that the end fell flat, and the name &#34;hunger games&#34; doesn't seem to really be the best choice for the &#34;game&#34; they were playing. I expected it to have a lot more to do with starving masses and fighting for the rights to eat. I probably wouldn't watch this movie again. The acting was very good and the characters were believable.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|My 3 year old grandson loves doing the puzzles. He sits for hours playing all the puzzles. His favorit thing to do is loping the balloons at the end.
B00933JL0A|5.0|it may seem boring at first because your just building a bunch of buildings but it gets really fun. but you have to know what to do and how to play to have fun with it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like playing it. It is one of my favorite games &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;people should really try it.it is a good app to spend your money on
B009VSW15Y|1.0|This is a horrible app. Absolutely horrible. This app is definitely not worth the money. There are no real features to it that should make this worth buying. For the record, I installed it on a Kindle HD 7\\" and deleted it because it added no real functionality and it looks hideous. How about whoever made this app use the money you're scamming off of us and pay to put yourself through some programming classes so that you can create an app that will contribute to the development of humankind. How about a refund?
B0027Z2T8C|5.0|If you love Kill Bill and Man With The Iron Fist, You've got to see this!!!  It's action packed with tons of fighting and comedy!
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|This is great for the cars fan.  Has every type of format.  I loved watching this movie in 3D for the first time!
B00095NX9G|4.0|As I've said in other reviews, I look at Rachel Brice DVDs as more of a training session, since I'm not a Tribal Fusion style dancer. And I like that she teaches good, strong technique and does it so clearly. If you ARE a Tribal-Fusion stylist, I think you would enjoy her series.
B004I654WQ|5.0|Must have for the cars fan.  Great picture.  Nice to have both formats just incase.  Love this movie.  I reccommend.
B009YX02T8|5.0|Amazing soundtrack!  Would highly recommend purchasing. Music flows with movie.  Songs are unique, similar to other soundtracks. Very happy with purchase. And of course, the movie was great as well. It will not disappoint
B000PKX2KA|5.0|I use the GlobalSat BU-353 USB GPS Navigation Receiver connected to my computer to run marine Navigational software on my 40 ft. sailboat.  I just put it up against the port window and it connects quickly and accurately.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I absolutely love this game. The use of different colors makes it even more fun and challenging. Definitely 5 stars.
B008X9Z3UC|4.0|Does just what it says. Nothing more, nothing less. It's a great fitting case to take your Kindle Fire HD from point A to point B. Lightweight, formfitting. I dig it.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This game is very enjoying. Once I git the hang of the screens with 4 sets of tiles I was on the roll.  I also like the music...
B004X80QNG|1.0|They sing praises about features of this app that are not even available. They should have to call this app by another name because it is not the Pocket Informant I have used before from the Google play market.
B001B51B9M|5.0|This is my boyfriend's favorite musical. He's been wanting his own copy for many years and will be very surprised to open this Christmas morning!
1439153663|5.0|one of the best books I've read in a very long time. a definite must-read. my sister read this via audiobook and really wished she had the physical book in her hands on this one. so I bought it and will definitely be loaning it to all my reader friends.
B008Y5FNL4|5.0|This movie is a fairly accurate portrayal of the war in Southeast Asia/Vietnam; I arrived there in 1966, only to be surprised by the differance in 'view' between the order givers and those who carried out these sometimes pointless orders.<br />While the people back here (USA) argued over this war, not willing to fight, young men were being blown up, shot, starved, abused by 'superiors' and sent into the bush to die. All this for a 'loosing' war that we could've won. We lost it due to the lack of courage by those that made the decisions concerning what they wanted as the outcome; for politicians, VOTES, for generals, a higher rank.<br />56,000+ men and women died...........for what?
B008MM9630|5.0|Great game it gets you hooked  and addicted its better than farm story and all the other farm games ive played
1454901276|5.0|This one snuck up on me. I learned about it by accident and now I think it is the best of the 40 or 50 novels I've read this year. Yes, it's a mystery. Yes, it's a thriller. But, there are also some great insights into human nature that effect all of us even if we live on a remote island off the NW coast of Scotland. Try it - you'll like it. I'm going to search for other books by this author.
B008JJM88Q|1.0|I purchased and installed this on my Kindle Fire after my daughter told me what a fabulous game app it was.  I downloaded and played it on a Friday night.  Turned Kindle back on Saturday night and app wanted to update itself.  I said No, Thanks and from then on it said there were network problems and to retry when the problem was fixed.  The problem is this app.  If I want to use it I must now re-buy???  I don't think so...even tho it amazed me by guessing Carl Rove.  I would suggest that if you purchase it and it asks you if you want to update that you manually update your game from within Kindle, not through this app.  Haven't decided if I'll re-purchase...fun but not worth the headaches.
B007T99ENE|4.0|I enjoy McEwan greatly so this was a welcome addition to my collection. A little hard to stick with in the middle but I LOVED the twist at the end. Recommended.

B009UHHELM|5.0|When it aired in the UK in September and October of 2012, the BBC's 5-episode \\"Parade's End\\" mini-series, based on the novels of Ford Maddox Ford, [[ASIN:0307744205 Parade's End (Vintage Classics)]], won RAVE reviews in the UK , especially for the principal actors, Benedict Cumberbatch (you know him as \\"Sherlock\\" in the BBC/PBS series, [[ASIN:B004132HZS Sherlock: Season One]] and [[ASIN:B004QOB8SO Sherlock: Season Two]]) and Rebecca Hall (you'll recognize her, too, from such movies as \\"Starter for Ten,\\" directed by Tom Hanks, [[ASIN:B00005JPOH Starter for 10]]).<br /><br />Tom Stoppard, generally considered the UK's finest playwright, adapted the novels for this mini-series and wrote a fine and moving script.<br /><br />Anything that Benedict Cumberbatch is in is worth watching. He and Johnny Lee Miller (the latter plays Sherlock in the current U.S. show, \\"Elementary\\") won a shared Olivier Award for their roles in \\"Frankenstein\\" on the London stage. The two actors alternated nightly, one being the monster and the other being Dr. Frankenstein. Cumberbatch been nominated for Emmys and BAFTAs (UK's version of the U.S.'s Academy Awards) and has won numerous other awards. He plays the unnamed \\"bad guy\\" in the soon-to-be-released Star Trek II prequel with Chris Pines and plays Smaug in \\"The Hobbit,\\" which will be released in December of 2012. He is a classically-trained thespian who may just be may be the finest actor of his generation.<br /><br />\\"Parade's End\\" will be shown on PBS in the US in the spring of 2013. If you can't wait, buy an all-regions DVD player (about $50) or an all-regions Blu-Ray player ($100-$200), grab a cup of hot tea, and settle in for a fabulous weekend watching the 5 episodes!
B003U9TDII|5.0|Moody when it needs to be, epic when it needs to be. I cant stop listening to it! This music has proven to be a wonderful inspiration for my various writing and other projects, and there is not a higher award i could give something!
B007ZD17XO|5.0|for a match 3. game this is incredible many power ups and prizes keep the mind focused.  addictive for in between moments
B007J4T2G8|5.0|My husband, a die hard reader, 2-5 books a week loved this book. Was surprized and intersted in reading it myself.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I love every song on this cd and have been listening to it over and over! I definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested!
B00A4GXJD0|4.0|I like the album and the convenience of downloading thru the amazon cloud.  The downloads thru amazon are also cheaper here than on iTunes.
B008KOTNVA|5.0|I am an avid DIY guy.  Most 'problems' with consoles, controllers, and other small electronics I've found is generally the goop of life.  This kit has just about everything needed to disassemble small electronics to clean and 'ungoop' them.  I bought this primarily for the tri-wing bits needed for disassembling DS Lites that my kids have found numerous ways to damage and goop up.  Great small bits including small torq/security bits for those XBox controllers too.<br /><br />Highly recommended if you are not afraid of taking your electronic devices apart to clean or repair.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|How do you make a fantasy so meaningful in this utilitarian age? Yann Martel does it by locating the story in the harsh reality of a young man lost at sea after the ship carrying him and his family (and animals) sank. Is the Bengal Tiger with the cool name real? Does Pi's belief in God(s) really matter to his ability to survive his ordeal? Read to the end this great novel and decide for yourself! Only then see Ang Lee's movie version of the book.....
B000YHG72E|5.0|I love this movie sooo much! If you have never seen this, watch it right now! Hilarious, Crazy, Sweet, and just a fabulous Christmas Movie, or a movie for anytime! Will DEFINITELY get you in the Christmas spirit! hILARIOUS!!!
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|The idea is great but it constantly closes on its own.  It wants you to get items that isn't available.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|This was a great movie. The special effects were fantastic. I was already a big fan of Charlize Theron but now I'm also a big fan of Chris Hemsworth.
B0012HRJEA|5.0|I watched this on DISH one night and decided to order it. My students and I are reading the play in school, and I thought this film adaptation would be great for them to view and and use as a compare/contrast assignment.
B0045XICB2|5.0|I was not a Twilight Fan until I watched this. Now I'm hooked. You will become a fan too. Watch it!
B007RI56NY|5.0|love this cd play it all day long great for a long car drive. you will really enjoy this cd
184195392X|5.0|It's a book. You can't really go wrong. Arrived on time. These are my 9 more words required to finish this review.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I got this case/cover for my wife's Kindle Fire, and she is VERY HAPPY with it.  I checked it out myself, and I was impressed with its leather-like exterior feel and textured city name inscriptions.  On a related note, my wife says the inscribed city names give the exterior case a \\"grippy\\" feel that makes her less likely to drop her Kindle.  On the inside of the case, the Kindle is secured very tightly by the elastic bands.  I have no concerns whatsoever that the bands will not hold the Kindle, even if she accidentally drops the entire case.  It's no wonder this case gets such exceptional reviews.  It is a winner, for sure.  Hard to see how anybody could find fault with it.  Buy it and enjoy!
B009PJXY3M|5.0|I was incredibly impressed with Bridgit's debut album. Her voice is rich and vibrant. Every song is enjoyable. Please do not lump her in the bubble gum pop crowd, this girl is something special.
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|If you like old style soul with real musicians and singers he gives it to you with a modern spin.  He's also a great showman though you can't get that on a CD.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Cornwell is finally back to writing a great novel. For those of us who love Scarpetta, this book gives us reasons to love her even more.
B00A8J20KG|5.0|I love this album!! from pop to hip-hop to R&B she showed true talent with this record!! I love this album.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|A must have app on any device. I have it on my Kindle Fire HD, iPhone and Desktop PC. I use it all the time to synchronize my notes and keep my important information updated.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Nicely produced. I am very happy with this purchase. Lovely game for people who like visual puzzles. Super fun app!
B009WO7NQO|4.0|It's really fun to play. Birds have new powers that makes it good. Although it seems more difficult to get the three stars
B003TSEEDY|5.0|My daughter asked if I would consider reading this book before I agreed to take her to the movie. So I did and was thrown into a tailspin of emotions.  It is so full I really don't know where to begin.  A must read for anyone dealing with middle school and high school students.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Nice to have the Facebook app installed on your device for updates. But no matter if you use it on Kindle, iPhone or any other device, IS ALWAYS SLOW. But it seems to run faster on the Kindle (although not much). Improve this Facebook
B004JNB4UO|4.0|This movie is well-made, and presented well.  I had no personal liking for General MacArthur, and my feelings were enhanced by the presentation of his super-ego overiding vast military experience.
B008B1VYP0|4.0|Overall a great album. I bought it for Phonebooth, One more night, and Daylight, but have loved all the songs on it.
1400049628|5.0|This book is the best thing i've read in a long time...couldn't put it down, highly recommend this awesome book
0439813786|5.0|Love the book, and love the pictures inside. This book is great for anyone no matter how young or old!
B007TK77QE|2.0|I really tried hard to continue with reading this book, but it just didn't grab me.  Thank goodness I read it on my kindle as I often had to use the dictionary to work out what she was on about. It felt like she was trying too hard to write an &#34;adult&#34; book, and used her thesaurus to through in grown up words. characters and plot did nothing for me - but I have to admit I didn't finish it and it may have gotten better.  I just couldn't force myself to go any further. Sorry. Still love J.K. Rowling.
B007TXN4TK|4.0|I thought this program was a great way to see if you like the virtual piano experience.  I am playing on Kindle Fire and it works great.  I am not very good with virtuall keyboarding so this is good practice. comes with enough songs and varied skill levels to help you work up to a fanicer version of virtual piano playing.
B000OV85AW|5.0|Two great actors ,a great plot. Simply the best. It speaks to the barbary of mankind. Hope they never do a remake it would never be as good as the original.
1575666286|5.0|this book is a mind opener!! why the doctors don't talk about diet. Many people could survive cancer if this therapy could be used in the hospitals
B0015DROBO|4.0|I very much enjoyed this novel. The plot, story, and character development was very good. The layered story kept you interested and wanting to keep reading with few interruptions.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this novel to anyone 18 and over.
B007MG360G|3.0|it's a really good game and I like it button it's. way too easy I beat it in about an hour
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|It is a very witty and well &#34;acted&#34; show!!!  I have not finished the previous Seasons, but am looking forward to the new season!
1603429999|5.0|The most complete guide to circular knitting I have ever come across. It will  invaluable in my future knitting projects.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|The movie is average.<br />The picture quality provide by amazon was not up to the mark.<br />Amazon realized that and refunded the cost of the movie!! Thank you :)
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|This was a great movie to watch.  Loved the graphics and the story!  Did not think I would like a &#34;cartoon&#34; movie, but this was good.
030758836X|4.0|Very well written and wonderfully suspenseful!  Truly enjoyed every minute of it.  It contains some edgy scenarios and lots of use of the &#34;f&#34; word, so if that offends you, you may think twice.  Otherwise, if you like a good, suspenseful read, with lots of twists and turns - you'll love it!
B001P06GX4|1.0|The same day I ordered this product I noted that someone had submitted a bad review.  Just picked up my order and writing to let everyone know if you are looking for \\"Blokus Classics Game\\"; this is not what you will receive.<br /><br />My package arrived wrapped in plastic, the box was damaged at the corners and dented.  The title on the box was \\"Family Strategy Game\\" but no where is the name Blokus.  The shipping invoice says Blokus.<br /><br />This is false advertising and seller (unbeatablesale168 out of El Monte, CA) should not be charging the same amount of money and advertising it as \\"Blokus.\\"  Have requested a return but do not know how easy the process will be.  Shop elsewhere for the real game and not this marketplace seller.<br /><br />UPDATE Dec - received credit refund for item in early December.  In addition to emailing the seller, I also contacted Amazon and just in case got advice from my credit card company.  Amazon was the one who notified me of the refund.  Have not heard from seller.  I have not opened the package as yet and waiting to find out if the seller would like to pay for cost of return shipping.<br /><br />UPDATE Nov - checked USPS and it will cost less than $10 plus packaging and delivery notification to return the package which is not worth the money for me to return and then buy the package elsewhere even if I really wanted to just on principle.  I'm sure the Seller was expecting that.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My son bought this game for his Ipod and I got addicted to it.  I got it for my tablet and it won't open up all the way.  You get to the main screen but the rest won't open up.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|its to good but some times you just want sit back and play coin dozer<br />yasaaaaaa yaaaaaaaaaaaa ya ya ya ya
B009CG2YDE|3.0|Glad it was free.  Not bad, but not great.  I couldn't get my guy to move very fast across the screen.
B003Y5H556|5.0|This movie is exactly what I wanted after watching the trailer for \\"The Village\\" so long ago.<br />While The Village was a fine movie in its own right, this is the movie that I was expecting, and have been waiting years to see.<br />I also love the nods to the other big bad wolf stories in the film, like Three Little Pigs, Peter and the Wolf, etc...<br /><br />If you watched the trailer for The Village, and felt slightly disappointed that the movie didn't fit the trailer, then give this movie a try.<br /><br />If you like dark, who-done-it stories, and twists on classic fairy tales, this movie shouldn't disappoint!
B00498VS9G|5.0|Set in the Big Brother house, this zombie movie has a few laughs but Shaun of the Dead this is not. Very brutal series.
B009CG2YDE|4.0|fun easy to play game.  fast paced and enjoyable.  please add more weapons now now now now please. j like it
B008M87GJK|4.0|Certainly one of my top news apps.  Used it for 2+ years on an iPod Touch and now on the Kindle Fire HD.  I only wish it would cache pictures for offline viewing.  However when offline, the text is there so you can read the story.
B001IYCMNA|1.0|The 4410N works as advertised for a few minutes, and maybe up to a few days; however, it consistently drops connections.  Have this device connected directly to a WRT54gl with Tomato firmware.  Absolutely no complaints on the 54gl - a solid product if I've ever seen one, especially when paired with DD-WRT or Tomato firmware.  The 4410N is horrid.  Tried wired connection as an AP to extend wireless to a four-story home, and the AP continuously drops connections.  The longest uptime that I've had with it has been one week, and I've owned it for just over a year now.  The only reason that I haven't replaced it is that I am military and not home all the time.  Apart from that, my family is extremely frustrated with the product.  Linksys/Cisco tech support asks you to try all of their newer firmware designs, as I have, but to no avail.  I have also tried this device as strictly a repeater.  Worked for just over 10 minutes, then would not allow any data throughput - the same as it does on any AP configuration.  Should you search around, you may find people saying that they found a certain configuration that has worked for them for months.  I've tried these configurations, and have found that it is not the case for me.  I really love Linksys/Cisco stuff, but this item is complete crap.<br /><br />Bottom line, look elsewhere for APs or repeaters with these features.  As for me, I would have been better off buying TWO MORE WRT54gl routers, installing Tomato, and configuring them as Access Points.  Stay away from the 4410n.
B0087DIEGE|5.0|this is a necessary choice for you XZ-1, the cap in XZ-1 would fall off so easily when you forget to take it off
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|All tracks are well arranged and performed.  It's so hard to believe this music comes from just 5 voices.  I hope their career continues to thrive.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This Bible had the reading program I was looking for and I could choose what version (KJV, NIV, AMP, etc.) I wanted easily.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|We thought it was a lot of fun. My husband and I really enjoyed watching it the other night. Abraham Lincoln makes swinging an axe look cool.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|This is free fun for killing time. I never thought I would be hooked on a game but my husband and I take turns seeing who can get three stars first.
B009CPES4I|5.0|I saw this in the theater and was sure my husband (who is not a movie goer) would like it.  He did!  It provided a look at the lives of a group of people at what is generally considered the twilight stage of their lives.  Like most films of any value,  it provided humor and a poignant gimpse at the hearts and lives of each character.  You will experience smiles and chuckles when you visit this unique hotel.  As always, Judi Dench is grand and you will likely recognize several folks from multiple BBC/PBS shows.  Dev Patel is such fun!  Give it a try!
B001QXCYZY|5.0|Excellent quality at an amazing price! Perfect for recording my news broadcasts, station IDs, etc. Wish I'd stumbled upon this gem long ago. -Matt, KAVZ-LP FM 102.5 Deming, WA
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I love take pictures and edit them and this is the right one for it,and it also sends the pictures stright to facebook to this app is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|This is such a fun game to play.  It helps to pass the time while waiting any where! Most important it was FREE! I'd recommend this one to everyone!
B002ZG976U|5.0|This was an amazing funny heart warming and a little on the riska (sp?) side but really enjoyed the whole movie. Little Love story in that also.
B00A6PD8RQ|3.0|...but is not up to Pixar's usual standard.  Just not as engaging as others. Still, the acting is good and there are plenty of witty bits.
B008XG1X18|3.0|Not really sure what I am doing wrong with this one. Can't make sense on how to use it. Once I figure it out and sign on I may have a different opinion.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this app because I love dragons. This game lets you visit your friend's place and talk to them useing the wall. You can also play with other peaple and their dragons. Mom's of the children, this game teaches responsibility and is still very fun.
B009LK6JS2|5.0|it's frustrating if you fail to realize that you need to control the air-brakes while landing... or if you don't take the time to make a proper approach.  Fortunately you only crash a make believe game... but when you do land properly... what a thrilling game.  :)<br /><br />Would recommend to anyone who loves flying... but this isn't a shoot-em up game. :D
B003KRJNBW|5.0|This movie is about the Holy Bible and the end of the world in my eyes.  The last war has played out and of course it involved nuclear weapons and therefore little communities were being formed throughout the states.  All books had been destroyed especially the bible, and Eli was carrying the bible via memory which was fantastic.  You have to get the movie to enjoy this excellent piece of work and no I have not spoiled the movie or plot you will see.
B0086700CM|5.0|Highly addicting and fast paced!  The boards are constantly changing so boredom never comes into the picture.  My five year old loves it as much as I do.  Good luck!
B0091XRL86|5.0|Like the Wallace and Gormet type films and wanted to see how this was done.  Most excellent. Recommend strongly to one and all.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|Brave is a really cute movie with a good story and incredible animation. The actors that did the voices were perfect for their roles, very entertaining.
B0082Z1CVQ|4.0|First, this is not a review of any abridged version of the book. That book is garbage, and you should not buy it, regardless of the illustrations.<br /><br />Second, why is this book good? It's not particularly well written, for example. And there aren't a lot of deeper layers. Yet somehow it is good; but not just good. It's great. One of the great early American novels. So I guess it is the story itself, that of the timeless March sisters. Applicable to every family, every girl, and maybe every childhood. First fantasies, first loves, and first disappointments.<br /><br />One of the things I like most about this book is the unpleasant turns it takes regardless of the reader's wishes -- thus reflecting life itself. We want Beth to recover, but she does not. We want Jo and Laurie to marry, but that doesn't happen. Or at least for neither to be complete without the other. But again, no. Life does not cohere like that, and neither does this story. The dead remain stark dead and the \\"true loves\\" find other loves that they ultimately find truer. And that is striking; very realistic, very wonderful. Also probably why this story works better than Little Men, which was not based as much on reality.<br /><br />Some postscript notes: the earlier parts of the book are best, before we become depressed by the dual disappointments. It peaks when it tells about Beth's final days, that poor, gentle soul. I'm pretty hardened, but that got to even me -- well, a little, anyway.
B00A3AU1U6|1.0|I can't call this music but i can call it different sounds put together in a somewhat musical (i use that term loosely) way. If this is your idea of entertainment you would be better served putting your tv on a channel that is not in service and listen to the white noise. At least that is free. Brian has tried my patience before with this kind of crap and i honestly get the feeling that he is laughing at people who, in their self delusional musical snobbery, continue to purchase this drivel. You would think that after Lou Reed's Metal Machine Music record companies would have learned. But then, at least Lou gave us a decent album jacket photo. Glad i didn't buy this, i really would feel used.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|this game is fun but every level you build pretty much the same thing which gets very old. I still like it.
B004CLYKLI|4.0|I enjoyed reading this.  Very well written good story about an interesting parenting perspective.  Not sure it is the healthiest, but it was a good read.
B009V3KKXY|5.0|This book has so many facinating knots I hadn't seen before.  Making them is so much easier with colored pictures showing each step.  All I have to do is have the page in front of me and put my cords where the picture show them.  GREAT picture begins each chapter with the knots covered.  Bracelets or key rings or lanyards..your imagination can take them anywhere.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I could not put this book down.  For those that love books about time travel (and there are not that many) this is the book for you.
0547884591|5.0|There is so much info<br />I brought it for me but my husband can't put it down! It's more than a cookbook
B009CG2YDE|1.0|THIS GAME IA A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME DO NOT GET IT IT IS ALSO LOADED WITH VIRUSES DO JOT EVER GET THIS APP IT SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF THE APP MARKET DEAR AMAZON PLEASE TAKE THIS APP OFF OF THE INTERNET IT IS PIRETED OFF THE INTERNET AAAUUVUUY YVYVVYVJGUVJ JHVIJ U UY UG UYUY HH JH H HG J UVJG G YG YU
B00001OH7N|5.0|One of the greatest rock albums ever. From one great song to another great song this work of art is relentless. What's amazing is that you could remove this album from Bowie's discography and he'd still be one of the greatest rock stars that ever graced our ears. When I first got this, years ago, I had to make myself stop listening to it because it was getting absurd how relentlessly it was getting air time. If you want your rock sensibilities blown open then this is a good candidate.
B000P2A256|5.0|This is my favorite Maroon 5 album. Some of their best songs are on it, every song is a gem. If you like these guys, definitely get this one.
B0024SQW2Q|3.0|This is a fun movie for fans of the series. It provides an entertaining back story and some fun action sequences. Lets be honest, its hard to go wrong with vampires, werewolves, action, and a love story. But at the same time, I think we would be hard pressed to call this a great movie. It is clearly not as good as the first or second in the series but worth watching on a lazy weekend.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|just like everyone else, game stopped working. wont load after intro. tried reseting, reloading, everything i could think of but nothing works. don't waste your money!
B006PAZMMK|4.0|It's a great album, although I do have to say that there are some songs I've never bothered listening to.
0470570954|5.0|Hardcover and the paper printed seems to be the same as the full price book. Don't quite know why some people are still selling it for $200...is it because of the DVD or CD that comes with it? Not sure...anyway for my classes the book itself is enough and it is the full book so why pay more?
B00A7ZWUJC|3.0|Not her best work but there are a few amazing songs such as &#34;Stay&#34;, &#34;What Now&#34;, and &#34;Love Without Tragedy/Mother Mary&#34;.
B00130VLZ4|1.0|There is nothing &#34;semi hard&#34; about this case.  It is a soft case and offers less protection than the soft case I laready have.  I returned it.
B005LMEB8E|5.0|Overall it's a pretty great album, although there are a few songs that could've been left out; although, we do have to consider that she has a very young fan base.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abby is a refreshingly smart and entertaining historical series. It is beautifully written, complex, and always keeps yo guessing. The characters have real depth, and the plot avoids many of the cliches that make most contemporary television dramas unwatchable.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am so addicted to this site it's terrible and having it on the K F is heavenly. My only complaint is the trouble you go through using the K F when something needs to be deleted and you \\"CANNOT\\" to my knowledge sign out of Pinterest using the K F.  I made sure to download this App because there are many and this is the real deal. Don't be fooled by the pretty or cool looking Apps.<br /><br />Keep Pinning =0)
B008QE9VJI|5.0|Johnny Depp has proved himself to be versatile once again. His Barnabus Collins portrayal has in my esteemed opinion cemented him as the worlds greatest actor. I fondly remember seeing this movie and being absolutely blown away.
B0064W667Y|4.0|The graphics were well done and the plot interesting. However every time I read Mundanes, I thought of Muggles. My only gripe which is probably not the fault of the author was how it looked on my Kindle Fire HD. Without the ability to enlarge the panes larger, text seemed very small.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Well, I was feeling very smart until I got to the higher levels... now I have to really think.  It is still a fun game. Quick game to pick up and can easily go back to after stopping.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I liked this one better then the last one.  Not as much action but the storyline was pretty interesting. Didn't seem like a carbon copy of other books by Child.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My kids love the minions in particular.  It is a really fun film.  Not hard at all to suspend disbelief and just accept this film.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This wasn't what I expected at all and I'm really glad. I'm glad he went about it the way he did. It was very interesting and didn't have the ego that M. Luttrell's book has. That gets old quick.
B0020M99LC|5.0|Another great bond movie! Daniel Craig took a bit to get used to but fell into the role very well.
0439023513|5.0|I bought it for my daughter. She loved the book. It starts out a little slow but gets really good.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Amazing report of what these young men have to go through to become Navy Seals.  It also gives insight into who was really responsible for the tracking and killing of Osama Bin Laden.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|I played this on my kindle fire. this game lets you zoom in for the hidden objects. lots of fun but not too hard.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Even better than the last one..I can't wait for the next one! R.R. does not disappoint!<br />YA fiction at it‘s best.
B0045NDVFE|5.0|I did request their newest album. I assumed that was the one I was getting. Nope...  It's their last album before the new one.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Great plotline, good acting, amazing effects and just the right amount of lighthearted banter makes this action movie a must see. It's just begging for a sequel!!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Love this first season of homeland.  Great acting and action.  ONLY for mature audiences.  Some of the sex is too much.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Classic Christmas favorite that never gets old and looks even better on BluRay.  Great deal when I bought it on sale
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|For such a young group, only been together for 17 months, they are so accomplished and smooth.  One of those &#34;match made in heaven&#34; moments.  Their tight harmonies provide great twists on old classics, but never leave you going, &#34;HUH?&#34;  Buy it, it will automatically be your favorite Christmas album.
B002M2T1UO|5.0|Excellent product, full series plus bonus titles, great boxe set very impressed and great for gifting. highly recommend to &#34;the sheild&#34; lover in your life
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Instant gratification, love the price too! So much cheaper than iTunes!  Really really enjoy doing business on Amazon. It's fast, easily accessible, and all without leaving the comfort of my home!
B0053O89WY|5.0|I love the Big Bang and I have all the available seasons.  Just the thing when you need to get your geek on.
B009VB7QQA|4.0|At 1st I thought it was going to be a cheesy B type of movie but this actually has a good story to go with all the cool action. I was not disappointed. My wife laughed at me for getting it but she was really into it also and had to admit that it was a good movie. I'm sure I will watch it many more times.
