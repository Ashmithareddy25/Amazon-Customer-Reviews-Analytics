B001BC5HXG|5.0|It captures you from the very beginning. It tell a story of American history combine with human emotion that makes a wonderful read.
B0087EVHVW|5.0|This is the best value i5 processor out there (with onboard graphics).<br /><br />It screams compared to my Core2, but that isn't a surprise.<br /><br />Can't overclock it really, but then I didn't want to.
B000OVLINI|5.0|This is the first book I've read by Mr. Ruiz Zafon. I enjoyed the character development, especially Fermin. The plot is unique and intriguing. I plan to read more books by this author,
B002RI9VVM|4.0|an old classic from the late 30s. Well worth the read by the modern era. Short , sharpe straight to the point & very readable in a qqqqqqqqqiet evening. Unpredictable ending? I thoroughly enjoyed my read.
B005ZMV2EQ|5.0|It's awesome to watch movies on ur Xbox with amazon instant video.  Now I don't have to spend crazy cash on others sites or apps!

0374531269|5.0|A Long Way Gone is a tragic tale of violence in an often misunderstood region of the world. This story is told from the perspective of a child soldier who loses himself or maybe supresses himself under the veil of a merciless killer. In the West, all we ever hear from this region of the world is about famine, violence and hunger. This book takes that apart and goes in-depth as to the real struggles individuals in the region deal with daily. There are various organizations, like Invisible Children, who's mission is said to be saving this region from the horrors, but they too often simplify the real issues plaguing the region. There is much more that goes into the conflict than a 30-minute video designed by marketing professionals to virally incite the West to be the savior to Africa.<br /><br />Beah's story is raw, powerful, and heartbreaking. Be prepared to weep at the horrors he bears witness to. When he is ultimately saved, the story becomes an inspiring tale of the resialliance of the human spirit.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I couldn't down! If you love books that keep you on the edge... this is fir you!! Just a little hard to follow, but great anyways!

B004FRX0MY|5.0|Stream works well and I connect it via Bluetooth to my cars stereo. Easy to use and navigate my albums.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This Game is so awesome! It's so fun and very challenging! Every level is different and its so fun! This Game is a must have! :)
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Another great Quentin movie! I was very impressed. A lot of action and enough humor. I would highly recommend this to anyone
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Very well organized, covers all of the necessary formatting topics prior to submitting a manuscript for publication.  I perused it only, since I'm a long ways from completion of a document.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Powerful novel and timely glimpse into North Korea. Adam Johnson's interview at the end of the novel showed the depth of research that went into this novel.  He masterfully wove it into a tale of love and suspense.
B007ZSBQYE|3.0|Fun but frustrating game.  Frustrating because the controls were so UN-car like.<br /><br />The left controller uses a steering wheel graphic but you don't turn it to control the turn the car, you slide it left and right.  I instinctively kept trying to spin the wheel.  A wheel or dial would be more realistic.<br /><br />The right controller is three buttons, forward, reverse and stop.  The buttons work but the are not arranged like a real car's. The buttons are setup in two rows; the top row has the forward button, and the bottom row has the stop and reverse. To be more car like the forward and stop should be paired together(like pedals on a car) and the reverse set off by itself.<br /><br />The aerial view of the game is also a challenge, a view from behind the steering wheel of the car would be more realistic.
B0086HGW42|4.0|While there are times that I think i'm listening to Jason Mraz I still find the album to be pretty good. I enjoy his lyrics. I love JM btw I just prefer artist to have an individuality.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|excellent read. the characters exploded on the pages with intense identity, purpose and truth.  Took my breath away. I couldn't stop reading.
B000JQUHLM|2.0|This book was predictable. It's not the worst book I have ever read, but I recommend that readers choose something else.
B000S88JTS|5.0|I can't believe the speeds that these old motorcycles ran on dirt tracks and the daring young riders that competed flat out with each other. They were surely made of sterner stuff than I, and I love riding my old bikes.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a legit app the game is like temple run just that you is have missions to do and they real specific I wonder if it
B008HK3XU4|4.0|Works well with my Kindle fire HD, good protection and a sturdy case If I want to watch a movie the stand holds it up well.
B0039RY3MM|5.0|Bought this to use when delidding my i5-3570K. By using this between the die and IHS and IHS and heatsink block, I saw a temperature decrease of 25-30°C. Excellent product.
B001CB8NQE|5.0|I have watched the originals off and on and I have no idea how I waited so long to watch this fun eventful show.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|it is great can;t wait for season three, was very well done ,great story, the scenes are amazing ,the acting is very good you will have your favories.
B004MPESSY|2.0|I have seen the original, and while the acting is better in this remake, the graphic revenge scenes are way too over the top for my tastes.  Its a troubling tale of rape and revenge, made more so by the extreme depictions which add nothing to the film and are meant to appeal primarily to viewers who like movies such as &#34;Hostel&#34;.
B00B2QG3K2|4.0|I really liked Paramore since their start with their first album , \\"All We Know is Falling.\\" They've grown a lot and lost two of their main members.... Still, even with that, this album is a little different from their old music but its very good! The music is mostly upbeat. My favorite song is \\"Grow Up.\\" :)<br /><br />I recommend getting this album.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Our daughter introduced us to this series and we were hooked! It's sort of like Gostbusters, but with intensity and depth. There are moments of seriuos thriller mixed with humor. Great series. I highly recommend trying it - just don't be too serious.
B003K16P50|4.0|Quirky, funny and very human; I thoroughly enjoyed Salmon Fishing in the Yemen.  The characters are believable and I appreciate the intelligent writing and the dry, witty humor.
B00992CF6W|5.0|make a free version of pocket edition<br />i really love minecraft and i dont have any money to pay for it<br />i
B009KS4XRO|4.0|It is a fun and social game that's keeps you coming back for more. Would give it 5 stars but it freezes every once in awhile and you lose prizes in the process.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Excellent story of family,love,and mystery.  The way the mind can block out things too painful to remember and how the love of someone can get you through anything.
B000W93CHC|5.0|it's a gripping book! you can't put it down. great story telling. highly disappointed by the movie version...don't watch it. enjoy the book instead!
B008IYR2BA|5.0|Looks like clever, complicated Dexter will be giving us another good season! We will see in the next episodes, can't really judge just yet if this one can possibly top the fifth season.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|Another Mission Impossible that's fun to watch. Tom Cruise is excellent as always. A great way to pass an afternoon.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I use this game in my down time to de-stress. I find myself playing a lot while my husband drives.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I liked all the various plots and characters. The actors were well chosen for their parts. Makes you wonder what will happen next.
B002Z0TPFE|4.0|G.I. Joe was one of my kids fav toys. My wife and I thought this would be an interesting action movie.. to a certain extent it is, on the other hand it is directed to the current kids in the age group mentioned. Will I watch the sequel, I think so.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Thrilling storyline. Wonderful casting. Superb actors. Great location, cinematography, editing and directing. Completely engrossing series. You will not be disappointed.
B00004WIDQ|5.0|Really enjoy the Full Screen version. Excellent &#34;edge of your chair&#34; excitement, and the recreation of the dinosaurs was awesome.
B00BIVN82M|3.0|Michael sounds best when doing what he was born to do.  This album is catering to every audience possible.  In other words it is too commercial.  Sub par.  There are a couple of songs when you can remember why he excited us in the beginning.  If you want to buy this then consider which songs are best and just buy them.  The total album is not recommended.  I own every album he has recorded.  I will think twice before I buy another one.
B00003CXB6|4.0|Really enjoy this series, wish I could have gotten this in Full Screen. Once again the design and recreation of dinosaurs was awesome. Kept us on the &#34;edge of our chairs&#34;.
B009CWVARO|3.0|Unfortunately, as this one comes across on digital broadcast, it doesn't look good.I'm not sure if it's the fact that I was watching on an HD tv or it's just the way it was digitized...but it's not good.Too bad, it's a good movie.
B000GCFO0S|5.0|This is a great movie to have in your collection! If your a silent hill/resident evil fan , it's a gotta have!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Cute story. It was certainly predictable, but I still got wrapped up in it and actually couldn't put it down until I finished it.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|Conan Doyle in all of his works operated on a level head and shoulders above anyone for his time or any other time. This was a particularly fine edition.
B005GFPZYK|2.0|Not particularly well written. Chris Kyle does put you in the middle of the action, but I was left with a feeling emptiness concerning the war.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|I started watching this show only seriously in the second season. I watched various episodes of season 1, but every episode of season 2. The character development is amazing.  The plot always interesting. The scenes and sets and costumes beautiful.<br />Go watch this
B00C1XZ2LQ|5.0|it's mindblowing how much this soundtrack adds to the world kosinski created.... it's just breathtaking, and it truly brings the words &#34;beautiful desolation&#34; to life.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I really like this game its really fun and cool. its great for kids and adults I recommend nemos reef to everyone!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|better then the first, still unbelievable and far fetched. And again a very quick read but as lacking in depth as the first.
B009MO5E10|5.0|This is an excellent movie! It starts of fast-paced and stays that way until the end. If you're looking for a captivating movie, this is it!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Harry Potter for adults, pure fantasy, could have been better with more realistic characters.<br />I did have to finish the book, as I have never left a book half read..once I finished, there was enough of a &#34;cliff hanger&#34; to persuade me to go on tho the next 2 books
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love everything about the series...the writing, the acting, the scenery, the costumes, the era.  I now am starting season 3, anxious to find out more about the lives of the many exciting characters.
B004Q3UL2O|5.0|This is a great movie with depth. Coming out of college I wanted to work for a pharma company, instead I went to the alcohol business. The training looks so similar. I love seeing the relationship in this movie grow and nurture through the peaks and valleys of love. Both actors are so believable in this story. The ending is so surprising and know greed doesn't always come before love.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|I was expecting a little more from Denzel.  I always enjoy watching his movies, but this one was a bit too dark.  I understand what they were trying to do, but it just fell flat for some reason.  It seemed it was showing the dark side of humanity, but in a way that has been done over and over.  It just didn't feel original and dragged on.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great game, but it freezes an awful lot and makes it frustrating when you only need one number to win.  But it is addicting.
B00BAYLQI0|1.0|Now i realize this is loosely based on the true story of a Spanish family's survival of the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami. And Yes, I agree with many who feel the movie has racist undertones by its exclusion of the devastation of the native Thai people. But it really leaves me wondering why the only two Americans in the movie were...<br /><br />#1 - the a$$hole tourist who denied Henry use of his cell phone, and..<br />#2 - the woman who, after reluctantly agreeing to oversee Henry's two sons while he went to search for his eldest and his wife, allowed the sons to be taken without instruction by rescue workers.<br /><br />Hmmm...now that's an interesting artistic interpretation.<br /><br />Just saying...
B00007J5VN|4.0|If you are a musical buff, you should have this in your library. This story is a truism, the fickle of fate is not always kind in real life and you have choices, laugh or cry!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is good I love the ropes and the upgrades hi to all viewing this and hope you enjoy the game personally I love it and I'm trying to get all achievements
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Worth every minute of time watching.  makes one think about what big money and govt science are doing to us.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Amusing story, for the most part well done. However, the gore is a bit over the edge, not a movie for the kids to watch.
1400052181|5.0|this book was great another example of racism, and how Blacks has been used and mis used for years. Again all will be resolved when jehovah God's Kingdom takes place.
0385536828|4.0|Oh my. So much deception in this book, and just when you least expect it...there's more. A shocker of an ending. Made it wholly satisfying.
B000ICXQOM|5.0|This movie was a lot of my child hood and still to this day it doesn't cease to amaze me every time I watch it. If you haven't seen this make sure to pick up evil dead 1 & 2, watch those 10,000,000 times and then prepare for this fantastical delight. Don't forget to bring your copy of the Necronomicon!!!
030758836X|5.0|OMG--the twists and turns in this novel! I couldn't put it down. I didn't like the way it ended tho, but it fits the story...
B000PMFS2I|5.0|The best worst movie ever made period, this is the ultimate so bad it's good movie. This is camp at its best and beats any camp movie you've ever seen in your life, Elizabeth Berkley gives the best over-the-top performance of the 20th century, don't miss out on this cult favorite.
0670026603|5.0|This book was recommended to me by several people. When I read the description, I thought it sounded like another \\"chick-lit\\" books. But I decided to give it a go. And found that I couldn't put it down. The story is about a directionless young woman who takes a job as a caretaker/companion for a previously high powered, successful man who, due to an unfortunate accident, is now a quadraplegic. She's a free spirit, he's bitter and caustic. The writing is smart and draws you into the story. The author doesn't take the easy way out by glossing over uncomfortable subjects. This is one of those books you will regret NOT reading. And when the movie comes out (as I'm sure it will), you won't be able to tell everyone how much better the book was. How do I follow this one?(
B008YKGQR4|1.0|not worth it way to many glitches do not get just stick with FB the real one seriously not woth the down load
B00C1BUYX4|3.0|Young Mr Lincoln and Abe Lincoln in Illinois are far better movies. They are 2 classic movies made in 1939 and 1940.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|I heard very good things about dexter so i watched the first season and WOW its a great show!! i love the inner monolouges in Dexters head, its interesting to see a serial killer with a moral code<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT!!!<br />I love the ending when dexter kills his brother, but he doesnt enjoy doing it, its like getting rid of a virus<br /><br />highly reccomend this show!!!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I have read all of Grisham's books and I always have hope of finding the old Grisham I loved.  His early books were wonderful but his last 5 or 6 have been disappointing.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|So funny. Had to stop listening in public; I was making a spectacle of myself!  I may have to listen to it again.
B005BE79YA|5.0|This movie follows the journey of a young wealthy Brahmin who seeks fulfilment in life.He travels for years as a sadhu, tries life as a wealthy merchant, learns of sexuality from a courtesan, and meets the Buddha. Beautiful cinematography and hauntingly lovely music will delight  viewers as much as the philosophy narrated. I'd recommend this film to anyone interested in the Buddha, Hinduism , or Indian philosophy, but its beauty will be appreciated by a much wider audience.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|MLP is a great game. It is tons of fun!!! The gems should be a little easier to get though.
B00B4VXQC8|5.0|So, what band can say they have been around 30 years and still produce awesome music?  BON JOVI!!  This is by far my favorite album they have released since Crush!!!!  Seeing them live performing the songs helped to have more of a feel of the inspiration for the music but the album is incredible!!!!  I hope they never stop making music.  WAY TO GO BON JOVI!!!!!!!
0060254920|4.0|I bought this book because it is on every single list of best books for 3 year old kids.  When I read it for the first time, I was majorly disappointed. Pointless story, confusing messages, strange vocabulary with attention grabbing though slightly scary illustrations. I had to read it a few times to figure out how to put across the story to my daughter. But when I read it to her, I could see that she is totally fascinated by it. She wants to hear it again and again and I often see her examining the illustrations with great interest. So I think it's something between the author and his child audience. I still can't figure out what's so great about this classic.<br />P.S:She loves it more and more and now even I have started liking the wild things. Strange.
B002C949AE|5.0|It is almost unbelievable that one person could suffer so much, but at the same be so successful in making a life for herself and so influential in helping women all over the world. Waris has such a strong spirit as she overcomes unimaginable obstacles.  I loved this book and read it in one day.
B008I43DYU|5.0|Love how easily accessible it is and it's user friendly.  I have not used it that much yet, but so far so good.
0316069434|4.0|Michael Connelly is one of my favorite authors and I've read everthing he's published, including his short stories.  So, I was eagerly anticipating his new Harry Bosch novel, but I have to say, although each other one was better than the one before it, The Black Box was not. It just didn't have the same depth of character development. I'd also love to see another Mickey Haller novel or another one with both of them.  I certainly won't give up on this series.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I enjoy the easy access to this app.  It is a tool that is available, but not necessary.  I use it to keep up with the news, entering sweepstakes and general info.  Therefore, I am glad to have easy access to this app.  I would definitely recommend it.
B0087ITBPC|4.0|A mother/son road trip movie is sort of an uncharted journey in the film world. That made this a very unique film from the start.. Based on an actual road trip that Fogelman took with his mother is probably what makes the movie so real. Streisand and Rogen have great chemistry and since the movie is 80% just them, that is a godsend. Joyce's constant need to interfere with Andy's life in almost every aspect drives him crazy until an explosion of unexpected drama on the part of mother and son. There are so many funny lines and situations that the theatre was filled with laughter often. The movie could also take a very serious, moving turn which can move you to tears.<br /> Streisand has always been an actress of immeasurable range from musicals (Funny Girl) to comedy (What's Up Doc?) to drama (The Way We Were) with each type being a blockbuster hit.  In her semi-retirement she works very seldom.  It took them a year to convince her to come back to her first lead role in many years.  Her Joyce is perhaps one of the most real characters she has ever played  Stripped of glamour she wears track shoes and sneakers.  She is just a regular mother who lives for the happiness of her son.  Rogen has rarely played such a straight character as Andy.  Anne Fletcher has brought out the best of them both.  The climatic showdown is pure real dramatic that Streisand delivers with a powerful punch that stuns the audience as much as Andy.<br />. I liked everything about this film and can't wait to see it again. Don't skip the end because there are a lot of clips after the credits of mother and son banter that is very funny.<br />This is a great film for parents and grown children. I wish my mother was still alive- I'd love to take her to see it.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|It was a really fun game at first. And it still sort of is. It just gets boring after you've played it a lot. Also new characters don't go faster or jump higher. Boring.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|When I was chasing a battery issue on one of my devices, this app helped me to determine it was a problematic app and not the battery dying. This app works very well with my kindle fire and fire hd.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I am addicted to it. My son and i see who can get more points. most times he beats me.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Come in very useful when you need it to figure out something's. If you need a calculator this is the one .
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I thought it was awesome. I love all the characters on the show. It is so entertaining and funny, yet serious when it comes to solving crimes. I have all four seasons. Watch them all the time.
B00BK5D95C|5.0|Somewhat unsettling at first, but the more you listen, the better it gets.  The whole album is really strong, even the intros and interludes, which I normally find to be a waste of time.<br />The singer sounds like Adam Sandler from time to time.  I've learned to accept and love this.
B004WGIXX4|3.0|but I won't watch it again. not a tiny teeny biy momorable.  a way to klill some time no more
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I got the free version to try it. It hasn't worked very well. I know you need to be on line to play it, but still can't get it to work most of teh time.
B00797MB0O|3.0|but I won't watch it again. not a tiny teeny biy momorable.  a way to klill some time no more
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Its an amusing sorry with some stupidity, but funny. Worth renting, but not buying. I like the relationship development between the characters. They picked a mix of music that kept me interested to see how they would blend it together.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|Great adaptation of a classic Batman novel that inspired Christopher Nolan for his trilogy.  Highly recommend to any Batman fan.
1439153663|5.0|The subject matter, of indentured servants and slavery and their everyday lives was too much for me to pass up.<br />The book kept my interest, pulling me into the minds, souls and hearts of the characters. it made me smile, think and weep. what more could one ask from a novel....Would sincerely recommend it to anyone who in interested in the plantation life of the South. The author did a great deal of research and the story is a melt of truth and fiction.<br />But truly a satisfying read....
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I'm thinking this may be his best work yet - not sure yet.  In any case, he never disappoints with that gorgeous baritone and the range he is capable of.  I like the songs and music better on this album than his last CD.  Suits him better.  I'd like to see him branch out a bit more to other types of music....  get a bit edgier
1476734941|4.0|easy diet for people who can do without, for only 2 days,  and go back to usual eating for 5 day.  I am losing weight .
B0018QOIXU|5.0|Adele is incredible - love both her albums can't wait for the next one to come out.  She has a blues, rock, almost gospel sound and a maturity beyond her years - hopefully a lot more yrs ahead with that voice
B0049KWAVY|5.0|This truly is the best I've ever heard the carpenters sound. It's crisp and clear, it's just beautiful to hear these wonderful songs, sung with such clarity, from one of the greatest voices that ever graced us. Please re master more.<br />Kalle (London)
B00BJS7104|5.0|really good music and a twist in the ending really recomend this movie if you like repo man the generic opera........
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|What a tear jerker!  My daughter was right that this is a must read...  Buy this book and enjoy!  Sigh...
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I would definitely recommend this to those who don't care how closely the show follows the book. Just remember there is a LOT of details in the book that can no way make into the series.
B0027MJU00|3.0|For all of the hype the book received it left me disappointed.  The beginning of the novel is catching and while it is abrasive, what person wouldn't be abrasive having the life of Libby Day?  This compelled me to read and read.  I thought it was going to be a novel I didn't want to finish, but the ending felt banal--interesting in concept but lacking the shine from the rest of the novel.
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|The program is going a little slow. It is a really good story line. The acting is amazing.  I just expect more action.
1451695195|4.0|There was a lot of neuro info to weed through, but the book was very informative and entertaining. If you are highly interested in this subject,  you will enjoy this book.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|I agree that the movie has excellent actors. They did an amazing job on the movie. I liked the way thing were displayed.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks writes very good romance novels without graphic sex.  He added the element of suspense.  The movie was great as well.
B003U4ZOQ8|5.0|It's like Gilligan's Island with women that can be touched and everyone is dead.  Also, these dead people could probably fix a two-foot hole in a boat, unlike that phony Professor.
B00006879E|5.0|took a little long in coming, but then again it cam from overseas. Glad to restock my collection of CD's
B009AP2G26|5.0|Glee is still awesome in season 4 and the music is great. It's a must watch for me! I love it.
B008H7HE9S|5.0|arrived as expected, love Maroon 5 and it was cleaned up, I would order again if need be for a friend
B004J4XGN6|5.0|This book helps you navigate and understand the chaotic environment of uncertainty and lack of resources each entrepeenur is facing. Every minute of reading saves 1 day of useless work.
B002Y0TGOU|4.0|We enjoyed this movie - it's entertaining and great fun to see the formation of the original crew.  Don't want to give anything else away.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Very entertaining. Does take time to get into a large city without paying cash for more energy or money. Graphics are much better but still has the same concept.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I love this game.I love anything Paranormal.The graphics are great,the charecter's are fun & the story line is fun aswell.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this app! Makes following the pastor's message so much easier. I have no excuse to not read the bible now.
B00846F1YW|5.0|I love Nevosoft apps.I have yet to find one boring or too challenging.The graphics are always great & they twist things through out the game to keep things interesting.You'll play puzzles along with hidden objects.
B003F3PMYI|1.0|This book contains some good advice about cultivating a grateful attitude, but it takes so long to get to the point that it's not enjoyable to read.  From the other reviews, I gather that there are many better books on positive psychology available.
B0068AWO00|4.0|I love anything & everything Vampy.The leading guy in this(The Vampire)is one Hot dude but in this newer version of Fright Night he's not as sexy as the older guy in the orriginal version.Who(btw)also shows up during the movie as an extra.Peter Vicent in this movie is sexy as hell(when he's wearing is Vampire Killer outfit)Fun & exciting movie.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|The day after seeing this movies it kept me thinking about it all day along.  So many people know someone like Whip.
B00ARN0XGG|4.0|I love all the Paranormal Activity movies but like most sequels..this one's not as good as the last & so on.It was alot harder to catch on to some of the Paranormal activity too,you really have to look closely.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|One thing you will learn that today's government is no different than in the days of Lincoln.  Honest Abe???  It bit dragging but still interesting.
B002KVSJ64|4.0|I love Breaking Benjamin,I love his Irish soundind voice & their tempo & lyrics are awesome.Great to unwind with music.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Very enjoyable movie that keep a great even flow of what could possibly happen next.  Well written, acted and directed.
B00BIK3FAI|4.0|Very cute graphics,interactive with charecter's & sound.Fun for both adults(who are big kids at heart)& kids:)Good way to introduce reading to your kid.
0374531269|3.0|A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier by Ishmal Baeh is a story about a boy in Sierra Leone who goes through a war, which every boy goes through it seems, but this time, it's different than American boys. He's escaping from the army that wants him or is trying to make him become a soldier. This is a very well-written biography, but was a little difficult to get into the swing of reading it. But, once I got into the book, I was hooked.<br />I knew of the war in Sierra Leone because of my Economics teacher in high school, but I do not think I really understood what was really going on first hand until this book. The novel goes through this boy's whole experience and process to how he got to where he is today. I can't even imagine how it was to go through these events he went through, but I can feel his pain when he describes the detail of what he sees through his eyes.<br />But, the fact that I barely knew about this is sickening. We do not have enough current events in the West, as well as other parts of the world. These books are our only sources of what's happening on the opposite side of the world nowadays, and we, as students, only read it because it is required to. This book, to me, serves as a eye-opener and makes me want to learn more about what is happening around the world, and understand why history keeps repeating itself. I do recommend this book to others to read, although it was a little difficult at times to read, but it did serve its purpose of informing me, as an ignorant college student, and it will serve as a good reference in what should not happen to children in the future.
B0060D10I2|4.0|To hell with Alice,I'm watching for Johnny.Love Johnny Depp in any weird outfit or charecter he decides to be( most of them ARE weird).He was sexy when he was young & still sexy now.Ofcourse the Madd Hatter is over the top Cray Cray but well played Johnny,well played:)
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|it's a very fun and challenging. I would recommend this game to everyone who likes hidden objects games. I like the graphics alot and the music.
B001E6X4W0|5.0|How can you go wrong with a movie that has two(TWO)hot as hell men(Bradd Pitt & Tom Cruise)& to make it even sexier,they are Vamps.Talk about Fantasy.Love this movie.
B00AMXXNBI|5.0|We should know this stuff because we were taught how to write correctly in school!  We do know it... the information just got lost somewhere on our internal 'hard drive'.  &#34;Elements of Style&#34; reminds us how to write right.
B00AB0AXU6|3.0|just had to have it becuase I have the others amd to see where the story was going to go.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|A Tragedy and a  Triumph, field with realism of life and battle..  This is not your average &#34;Glorification&#34;  of a hero.. This man bleeds when pricked.  Yet He gets up and goes on.  I love the telling.  Thanks for being honost....
B009RH9FR6|2.0|I use a protective shield on my Kindle HD & the inside fabric of the case stained the shield.  It made lines of black that made it impossible to read anything on it.<br /><br />I did especially like the sleeve for your hand.  It made it easy to hold the Kindle.
B000OXHRRC|5.0|Russell Crowe is always wonderful. The setting is beautiful. Will watch it a second time just to breathe in the beauty of the story.
B007BT0RKG|1.0|The App was very slow to load.  Then it froze up my Kindle and I had to restart the Kindle.  Then I was afraid to use it again.
B00BC5I6Q2|4.0|This is a quality show, but if you have a month to watch it, get Netflix streaming for $8. If you don't, you really need to reassess your ability to budget!
B005K17RU0|1.0|If its not broke don't fix it. The other version was superior to this.  Too much going on sorry I upgraded.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|I like this movie even though it is not as strong a performance as Lord of the Rings trilogy. The actors are all noticeably older but passable for the movies sake. It contains a bit more comedy than it's highly successful trilogy. Lord of the Rings is one of my favorite trilogy and I consider them timeless classics. The Hobbit does earn its worth as a prelude to Lord of the Rings, it was worth watching.
B000087F6M|4.0|It was a good story, and well acted. However, I wanted the Redford character to observe moral law a little<br />better. Maybe that is naive on my part because I don't have a great amount of respect for lawyers in general.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Even though this series is mostly fiction, I just loved the acting and Jonathan Rhys Meyers is a wonder up and coming actor. I liked seeing him as Henry VIII much more than Keith Mitchell in the older 1970's version.  Costumes and sets were superb in my estimate.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I enjoyed watching this series when it was on broadcast tv.  But I didn't get to see the final 2 seasons.  Now I can watch it in order, start to finish!
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I have continued watching this drama every week on television.  It really caught my interest and I think the storyline is very original.
B00AIJP9BS|2.0|I read the mixed reviews but downloaded this anyway. It's not at all what it seems. I would click on the same person but the ball would barely move, time after time. Shouldn't be that difficult.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I really like all the Marvel comic films.  I am a big fan of Marvel since childhood and just love the Avengers.  Love the computer generated graphics in all their films.  Storyline was fantastic also.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Before Walt Disney died, Disney movies were like this one. He would approve of this one I am quite sure!
B006HL9G10|3.0|I picked up this app with the intent of using it to help me fall asleep, but the method, frequency, and sound of the 'bowls' didn't work for me. Perhaps if i were attempting to meditate, it would be perfect...
B009U9S6FI|3.0|I THOUGHT I WAS READING ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST, THEN, SUDDENLY, THE AUTHOR SWITCHED TO HIS THEORIES AND DISCIPLINES...WHICH I THOUGHT WAS TOO TECHNICAL AND FAR REMOVED FROM THE BEGINNING STORY LINE.  I DO NOT LIKE MIXING GENRES.
B00846WWVM|4.0|Fun game in the vein of angry birds. Objectives can be a little unforgiving, since your goal to put out fires can sometimes seem like you've accomplished your task in one area, only to find that a smolder remains, igniting things all over again. Seems like you have to douse everything above and beyond what you'd expect.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest possibilities are almost endless. I have used many of the great ideas on pinterest such as fittness/nutrition to decorating our home.
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|The game is simple enough: play a lifeform that absorbs others, get larger, and become dominate. However, certain levels provide enough obstacles and elements to make it more than the simple game it could have been.
B006S53QCK|3.0|Steamy, erotic, but not that great. Not a total waste of time as Kim Basinger is great to look at but the plot and story is bland.
B00846F1YW|4.0|Looking for a small game diversion for a bit, and this one delivered. The story is a little silly at times and the dialogue can be laughable, the game itself is fine. A few of the items can be difficult to find, but being able to replay the story with no penalty makes it a good time.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|takes long to download, but it is worth it!  I love the game it allows you to use your imagine, so much fun!
B00BOL22GY|5.0|Simply amazing, if you love Game Of Thrones you will love this. Has some actors from Braveheart, The 13th Warrior, and I mean the fighting is great. But it still keeps a plot, faith in humanity restored.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was amazing!  It really brings to life a valuable lesson in life. That no matter how hard things may get, good things can still arise from the bad. Truly touched by this last book of the series.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love puzzle games it was great to find one that was not too easy and made me think. If you get stuck try getting your best friend to play with you at the same time and work as a team.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is AWESOME! I just got.it a few minutes ago an  I'm already obsessed with it! It  like the extreme temple run! IN this game they give  u a lot.of stuff and there are so many characters that u can play as. Right now I have the original character but I want the girl name  tricky.
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|Loved it.  It lived up to the hype, made me laugh, made me cry, made me cheer...everything you need in a movie!
B009AMANBA|2.0|HoHuM...HoHum......HoHum...someone wake me up when the commercials start..I can't wait for the ads!!  and.. I am a history buff..its REALLY boring..........................
B0063M22QO|5.0|It has been many years since I played Mahjong.  I feel fortunate to<br />have found this game.  I find it interesting and challenging. Very  worth the money.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This film really opened my eyes to the condition of our food supply and,m for me at least, explained why our generation has so many more incidents of heart disease and other diet related conditions than our forebears who ate a supposedly &#34;less healthy&#34; diet. A must see if you are concerned about what you put into your body every day.
B0096HL33G|1.0|I kept waiting for something to happen, it never got any better.  What a flat boring movie, like some of the other reviews I too am glad I didn't pay for this movie.
B003JUGQ38|4.0|I know I am late to the Doctor Who party but I am really enjoying each season. Will have to see how things go with a new Doctor in season 5.
B0031YJFCQ|3.0|I just kept reading to see if it was going to get better.This is a pretty slow moving series. Hard to keep my attention.
B00947N6D8|5.0|It was a fascinating tale with all the legends and myths of childhood combining into one very watchable and entertaining story..
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Best .99 cent purchase I've ever made.  A lot of fun, even though I am generally not a science fiction fan.  Got it for my Kindle based on a friend's recommendation.  The stranded astronaut's voice was entertaining.  The science was not way &#34;out there,&#34; just a little beyond what I believe to be currently possible.  When the technical explanations occsionally got a bit deep and beyond the limits of my poorly developed understanding of engineering, physicas and chemistry, I just pick up the pace a bit.  A lot of fun to read with some interesting takes on the human condition.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Movie about a man that didn't care about anyone or anything is this world as much as he did himself.  His whole like revolved around &#34;enjoying&#34; himself to the fullest.  He was able to land a plane in the most extreme conditions, but the truth about his life came out.  In order to save himself and for the airline to save themselves, he threw all integrity and respect for those who had lost their lives....
B009LH1Y1W|4.0|I love this show. Just started watching it in the last 6 months and quickly burned through Seasons 1-7. There is something about how this show is written that really makes you care about the characters. I find this very enjoyable to watch.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This was a really great deal,IT WAS FOR FREE!When I found this awesome game in the app store,I thought it was a really violent game.But when I bought it and played it I found out that it was actually a really good game.I got on April 26,2013 and I played on it for 12hours.IT'S THE BEST GAME EVER.
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|My son wanted to play this game, as he loves animals and dinosaurs. The game wouldn't load passed the Gameloft logo, when it finally did ten minutes later the game itself wouldn't load. So we never got to play the actual game.
B009GEH5NG|4.0|One of the best James Bond films out there especially after the Timothy Dalton films.  Sean Bean as the villain definitely round out this movie
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Wow...as Rosie would say.<br />I spent two days immersed in this book, and my husband even brought me breakfast in bed so I could continue to read it uninterrupted. I'm a slow reader when I enjoy a book because I re-read as I go - instant replay - but this book was worth it. As others have said, it's not often a book makes you laugh out loud, but The Rosie Project does. It has some of the most hilarious scenes I've read, especially the cocktail scene. Brilliant! I can't wait for the movie.
B000RLHDUM|5.0|Just loved the mischief, the tension and the humor they played. All in all a good movie to watch at home.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I first read about wheat in an interview in ACRES USA, a journal for organic farming practices, and I was shocked to learn how original wheat was changed through mutagenesis, in the 1960's. I had no idea wheat was changed so much, and how it effects the human body. Consider what had to be altered in order for wheat to produce around nine bushels and acre, to up to ninety, in modern times.  That caused me to seriously consider what Davis, the Cardiologist had to say.  I bought Dr. Davis' book, &#34;Wheat Belly&#34; to read more, and I now recommend it to everyone. Most health conscious people understand how too many carbohydrates can adversely effect the system, but this takes it to a whole other level.<br /><br />In only one week after eliminating wheat from our diets, my husband and I no longer have any joint pain or stiffness, in general, in our muscles.  After two weeks, my husband is experiencing a marked improvement in indigestion problems. We are both losing weight without extra effort.  We are grateful. Dr. Davis' book is well presented and has just a touch of humor to help break up all the scientific jargon. I highly recommend this book.
B00B89WXYS|3.0|Have their first two, and loved them. This CD was not as good as their first two, but thought it was ok, I wouldn't play it as much.
B00B8PRDHE|5.0|A wonderful and incredible performance on this new line up of the All Starr Band which includes Matchbox first time Ringo sings this Carl Perkins song since 1985 ( Carl Perkins and Friends ) and the recording he did \\" with that other band\\" in 1964.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I've read the entire serious twice now but Breaking Dawn (book 4) is by far my favorite .  I've read it alone 4 times and am totally enthralled each time.
B009D0LBRO|5.0|This game surprised me when i saw that the only control was a screen tap, but once you get into the game, it get's so much more difficult than you'd think. The design for each level is amazing, each level flows smoothly and is just great to look at. This is one of the best platformers available for android/ios and its priced to move. if you're looking from great visuals, great gameplay, easy controls, and an even difficulty for a great price this game is for you.
B00448SE4S|5.0|Streaming video is the best. 24 hour rental gives you the flexibility you need and want. I am very satisfied.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This book has many layers and is very moving.  The Author has created beautiful characters.  The depth and pain of Jaime and Lily are difficult passionate and at times inspiring and at others overwhelmingly real and painful.
B0045HCJKS|4.0|as i had remembered it, for the time it was made a good sci-fi and still entertaining, miss mr. brynner, now i will need to get the king and i.  a good movie for the family who is into sci-fi.
B00000099Y|5.0|i couldnt find any tool albums on itunes so i bought and uploaded it to my itunes and on my phone and ipod. awesone music.
B0028MBKVG|4.0|This book is perfect for people looking for inspiration.  It is a compelling blend of documentary information with a true storytellers' twist. Made me feel lazy & out of touch with my humanistic instinct.
B000K8EQ5W|4.0|One of my favorite love stories. Great romance, without the vulgarity and nudity in most love stories these days. However, the time aspect is a bit confusing.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Just as good as first two books in the series, but with a few more plot twists. Can't wait to read the next book.
B005H9B2CE|4.0|I love the Marvel series and Thor is one of my favorites.Furthermore, Tom Hiddleston plays an excellent Loki. The only drawback is that I would have liked a little more action, and would have loved to see more of Asgard.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|I like waking up to music which motivates me. However, It may not come on if you cut kindle off; and in the description of this alarm it said it would cut itself back on.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This TV series is so wonderfully made!  I love to rewatch each episode as there is so much going on that I miss out on certain things!  A must see TV series!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I have had the Iphone app for years and the last 5 or so updates have been a let down. The app is slow, it takes a minute or more to load comments, and sometimes it freezes for 30 seconds or so. I hoped that getting the Android app for my kindle would have better results but they are the same. Facebook needs to do something as having the same issues for 5 updates is not good.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I bought this DVD for my oldest son as he is a Lord of the Rings fan.  This DVD will be a great addition to his collection.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Love this game..the dragons are great and you can create your own. Very fun to play. Lots of different things to do too.
B0042UEU8M|4.0|I think this movie was definitely a worth watch.  I enjoyed this movie very much, interesting storyline and well acted.
B0044C3RB4|3.0|The series has evolved into the classic: &#34;evil twin&#34; conundrum of so many cheesy stories.<br />The characters are still likable enough and some of the subject matter is intriguing as a sequel of what the X-files started. Overall, it is entertaining if you are able to &#34;suspend disbelief&#34;.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|George Martin continues to string along the stories and add characters, little is resolved with the characters I want to know about.
B009IF82SK|5.0|The show's 6th season and it's just as fresh as it has ever been... Up there with Friends, The Office, Seinfeld etc... Must own
B0011Z51QG|5.0|Best music that one can always have a great time with, no matter the mood. Never can get tired of the classics from Prince.
B009EAO38C|5.0|These guys are absolutely amazing!! I can't wait until the new CD comes out. Found their videos on YouTube and I had to go buy the CD!
B008JFUO36|4.0|Oblivion is undoubtedly a \\"homage\\" film.  This doesn't necessarily have to be considered a bad thing.  While it certainly is lacking in the originality department, it more than makes up for that with the enthusiasm it has for the movies it borrows from - specifically, late `60's and `70's sci-fi.  After the cheesiness and saccharine of the `50's, sci-fi took a side path into journeys of discovery and pondered the mysteries of the universe.  Film's of the time - notably 2001: A Space Odyssey - were less about action or horror and more about capturing the public emotion present in the years after the first man landed on the moon.<br /><br />Oblivion captures that spirit perfectly.  Considering it takes place on the ruined planet Earth, this is no mean feat.  That the film doesn't focus on the wreckage of humanity, but the wonder of what's been preserved goes a long way to keeping the focus on the wonder of the universe.  The color pallet is saturated with sunlight, a stark contrast to more dark and grimy post-Alien era of sci-fi films (the recent Prometheus comes to mind).  The architecture is cleanly designed - clearly, Apple Corporation's visual sensibilities will stay with us until 2077. All this serves to create a world that wants to be viewed and explored - not hostile and alien, but familiar and welcoming.<br /><br />Everyone will identify with Jack Harper, then, when he feels reluctant to leave.  Harper (played by Tom Cruise) is a maintenance tech on the vast structures that siphon water and useful materials from the barren rock that was once the planet.  He and his partner Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) are only two weeks from being able to pack up and leave to rejoin what remains of humanity on the \\"Tet\\", a sort of interplanetary ark.  Evidently, although the human race won the battle against whatever alien race menaced it, it left the planet totally unusable.  While Victoria is eagerly awaiting their call to leave, Jack is not so sure, his hesitance prompted by his discovery of a small oasis hidden in a mountain range that he frequently spends the night at against Command's orders.<br /><br />Amidst Victoria's feeble reassurances to Command that they are both still an \\"effective team\\", there is sense of something wrong.  Jack has continual flashbacks to a time before the world ended (a time he should not have been alive to see) all involving a mysterious woman.  As sci-fi tropes demand, as Jack is out on a maintenance run, an unidentified ship crash lands near him, and he finds her body in stasis in the wreckage.  Needless to say, not all is as it seems, and Jack's position slowly begins to unravel as he finds out he has been misled.<br /><br />No, it's not exactly original, but sometimes originality isn't necessary.  Oblivion walks in the path left behind by previous cinema heavyweights, but it does so with a vigor and pace that keeps the audience engaged, even when we see the twist coming miles away.  There are a few weak spots - while Cruise does a good job acting, his lines are often comically stilted.  There's a slight cheese factor here.  More demanding science fiction aficionados will find a great deal of plot holes as well, although many are closed up before the film's end.  Let's just say a lot of things aren't supposed to make sense at first.<br /><br />Setting that aside, Oblivion is a movie that does its predecessors proud.  With excellent visual effects, competent acting, and appealing callbacks to the golden age of sci-fi, it's enough to make you feel like the summer movie season is already here.by his discovery of a small oasis hidden in a mountain range that he frequently spends the night at against Command's orders.<br /><br />Amidst Victoria's feeble reassurances to Command that they are both still an \\"effective team\\", there is sense of something wrong.

B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I love this match 3 game, I have played it over and over, and still love it. The grafics are great, a game thats very addicting, I highly reccommed buy the Full version
B00992CF6W|1.0|hard to move around. no caves. no abandoned mines. barely any trees. there seems to be more hostile mobs then there are anything in the game
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|Either this product is broken, or the quality is just so terrible that the quality of the build in mic on my camera beats it out.  Tried it out (with battery installed correctly and turned on) and there was a crackling rumble in the background that sounded like an airplane taking off.<br /><br />From the look of the soldering inside the unit when you unscrew the battery compartment and the super cheap &#34;windscreen&#34; I would guess that the quality of this is of the &#34;how cheap can we make it in China&#34; kind.<br /><br />DO NOT waste your money!  If you're looking to have a decent quality recording, this mic is not for you.  Take it from an Audio Engineer with over a decade of experience, you'll get better sound recording a memo on your smartphone.
B00881PTRC|5.0|I like basic word games and this is a great version of Hangman!  The graphics are simple but cool and the game works well.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway Surfers is difficult at time but once you get the hang of it out gets easier. The only thing I don't like is when there are too many coins to collect and you can only choose between one lane.
B006N0YWGY|4.0|The controls are simple but give a reasonable feeling of accuracy -- even though you are piloting an airboat that follows its own path.  There are about a half dozen river stretches to follow, with an added gameplay bonus of buying and selling supplies.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|I think Quentin is amazing, and I've loved everything he's ever made. But some, such as Kill Bill I and II, Pulp Fiction, Inglourious Basterds are more exceptional than others, From Dusk Till Dawn, Jackie Brown, and Hostel.  I'd put Django somewhere in the middle. I really enjoyed it, but Tarantino has set the bar so damn high, that in comparison with other movies out there, it's incredible, but comparing it to all his movies, it's falling a little short. I wanted more information right off the bat about how the Doctor found Django and what specifically he heard other than that he'd be able to point out the people he was looking for.  I would have liked to see his training be something more interesting, such as Uma's in Kill Bill II.  There were some witty lines, but nothing like what you see in the above mentioned. Kerry Washington was wasted in her role. All she did was cry and act scared. They even have her faint in one scene.  Granted, her circumstances were the very worst, but so were Django's and he was a bad ass. Tarantino could have made her more of a partner, and stronger, like the women in his other movies.  She could have helped Django versus just be helped by him.  DiCaprio and Samuel Jackson are magnificent. The story is compelling and the idea of a slave turned bounty hunter is fantastic. Definitely worth viewing.
B00BF11STU|4.0|Very entertaining and informative movie about the struggles to track down Bin Laden and other terrorists around the world. A plus
0486409511|5.0|This book was full of great lessons to learn Cooperplate. I would recommend it to anyone. Thanks for the book.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I love this game. If I had to choose a Spider man game I would recommend this. I am going to recommend this to all my friends
0143038583|5.0|I never thought I'd like a book about food.  I really thought I'd hate this book, but my wife told me how good it was.  To my surprise I couldn't put the book down.  A great read.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|Best game ever since I was born in New York city!!!!!!!!!!!123AWESOME!!!!!I I want the best possible Hello kitty game ever since I have been the most popular stories of Hello kitty!
B005CKPQ7A|5.0|This is a show that must be watched in order, beginning with episode 1 of season 1.<br /><br />I have told so many friends about the premise of the show and how good it was.  For many of them it took years before they finally began watching it, but then, as soon as they had watched the first few episodes they were hooked.<br /><br />If you don't fall in love with the show and characters within the first three episodes of Season 1, then this show is not for you.  If you do, expect to find a show that stays fantastic throughout its 5 seasons (there was one season, either season 2 or season 3, which was not as good as the rest, but was still good......the other 4 seasons are all fantastic!).
B005FLX2WC|5.0|J Tyler Doubet<br /><br />Great Vocals, awesome guitar work and classic songs. This is well worth the price, and the wait.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|nice little sharpener.  took my really old Ka-bar out of retirement and it put a pretty sharp edge on. did require more passes than normal sharpening but im tellin ya this knife was REALLY dull before using the tool. now it cuts as well as i could ask. Good tool.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Since I started playing this game right here. I have come to the conclusion that this game is pretty good to me or in my opinion that is.
B007NVIB5U|5.0|It has been YEARS since I watched the bit version of this series. I loved it. I recommend this to anyone that has watched the American version.
B008HJGPVO|1.0|Would not recommend this this to anyone who wants to use this when leaving the house. The top does not stay on  meaning that one part  (tip) is easily lost.
B0087JTAKW|2.0|I was hoping this book would eventually get good or would become profound to me, but it did not.  I found the ending to be a little depressing, even though it was supposed to be &#34;happy&#34;.  Two of the characters were too shallow for me to sympathize with in the least.<br /><br />The story telling was choppy - like modern day American literature.  Yuck.  For me, it did not flow well and the overall story was not all that interesting to me.  I was glad it was over.
1780387105|5.0|Not only is it easy to follow but there are online lessons to go with it! These are the first free online lessons that had a book to go with them.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|The biggest issue I have is the frequency of updates. I'm so tired of doing adobe updates. It feels like there's an update every time I turn around.
B004QBWU02|5.0|Bought it for my 18 year old daughter to view, because I always liked it...she loves it...now one of her favorites!!!
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|love this game. lots of h.o. and puzzles. playing it for the second time now and still having fun. definitely got my moneys worth
6305212112|5.0|I fell in love with this movie years ago...bought it for my daughter to have a copy.  She watched it for the first time and absolutely fell in love with the story!!!
B008K8VDPU|4.0|The app is cute, and I get it...however you can't seem to pick a hand and keep on it...so the screen keeps moving back and forth between the hands. It almost gets dizzying and for me it's much harder to pick up that way. I'd rather they shrunk the keyboard down then move the screen like that.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Loved it.  Very inspiring and engaging read.  I am still going to keep my running shoes, however, as I am sure there are other sides to the barefoot running phenomenon.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This game saves my time!!!!!!!! To be honest I LOVE THIS APP SO MUCH NOT BORING!!!!!!!!! I think this app will do you well!
031237593X|5.0|I read this story when it was first published in 1982 and actually recently loaned that hardcover book out to a friend.  It was the essence of the story that remained with me all these years and actually made a &#34;Ricardian&#34; out of me.  Then I heard a rumor that a script might in in the works taken from this book.  Now time to re-read the book, so bought the paperback.  From the very first page, I was once again taken back to turbulent 15th century England and the lives of the 3 Plantagenet brothers, with the focus on the youngest - Richard, who became Richard III.  The 900 plus page book was a page turner in 1982 and is every bit as much today, perhaps more so.  Now I truly hope the rumor is true about a movie script possible being in the works!
0761171703|5.0|I work in a library, and when we got this book, I fell in love with it- and then purchased myself, and two friends a copy. It is fun, magical, and profound, all at the same time. In this crazy world today, it was a great escape... makes a great gift-to yourself and the ones you want to share it with!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love this game because every time you play the puzzle is different. There also is several different games to choose from
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Anna Kendrick is probably the most adorable female in hollywood right now and i'll watch anything she is in. This movie was actually somewhat entertaining too.
1601251505|5.0|This seems more like the player's handbook + dungeon master's guide from 3.0.  Quite a thick book, really good purchase. The additional details for the base classes make me not feel that prestige classes are really necessary, and this is in print and I like 3.0/3.5 well enough.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This app is a must have... I love all the features it has, like the white noise in the back round that you can listen to while you fall asleep... The numbers are a decent size to read if you get up in the middle of the night to see what time it is. You can set it to what ever time you are running to... This is AWESONE! Get the app, you will not be disappointed. But you will enjoy it and use it...
1601251831|5.0|I like the 3.0 &#34;monster manual&#34; more because it has more monsters that feel &#34;core&#34; and this has to make sure to be different, but it's still good. The art style is slightly different from the 3.0 books, but that's not a bad thing. Useful book.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|I guess because it was a Spielberg movie I expected more.  I had recently read a book on Lincoln so I felt myself comparing it to the movie quite often, and I think the book was more entertaining however that being said I don't want to diminish from the fine acting that was done from the cast in the movie.
B0064W67IM|4.0|My only complaint is the way the e-book works. I love the story line and the art, but when you flip through on the kindle, there are multiple times throughout the book that the kindle glitches and it doesn't move to the correct panels in order, or where it won't zoom in on any particular panel at all. Aside from these problems though, the e-book version really does add to the experience of reading Preludes & Nocturnes, it's amazing seeing it in such high quality!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Excellent, great writing, splendid acting, ver addictive. Can't wait to get to season three. The plot and the is great. Anna and Sybil are my favorite characters.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I dont see why people say its malware it runs perfect for me and is a nice program if you want to download your favorate youtubers latest vidio and not want to wait for youtube to load in the middle of the video
B0039O8AQK|5.0|did not order this book but I have read it before and it is an excellent prediction of the world today - everyone should re read it
B00BKBCF38|5.0|This album may not be the hard, driving metal that folks are used to these days, but that's because it's a callback to the guys who made that metal possible.<br /><br />I haven't had any problems with skipping (full disclosure - I got it as mp3, not CD, so I can't speak to possible issues with the disk), and as a fan of Blue Oyster Cult and similar bands, this album hits it out of the freakin' park.
B004Q3SGWG|4.0|I expected this movie to be boring (in an Open Water kinda way), but it turned out to be very engaging.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Enjoying this so far. Graphics are stunning!  Casual and Advanced setting suits my kid but I may change setting to expert for additional challenge. She and I love playing these together.
B009GED3HS|2.0|Well, its official.  The writers of this show have run out of ideas.  Every episode is just the same old jokes mashed together in different orders.  Lets just hope this is the last season.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I personally think it is an amazing book and that the next will be even better! That is my opinion.
B009AP2G26|3.0|Love the old characters and following their life stories. Still not quite sure what to think of the new characters.
B002RI9HUM|5.0|Took me a little while to get into this book but once I did, I really enjoyed it. It is well written, reasonably well researched and overall worth the purchase. I will look into other books by this author.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Love this series it is family friendly and completely addicting! Love it! Would recommend this to anyone looking for good family fun!
B002VECM6S|5.0|Sandra Bullock and cast did an outstanding job with a compelling and inspirational story although I have no idea of what Lawrence Taylor had to do with it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Your game is so awesome that I play it every day.I like the daily challenges and I like traveling from city to city.This is my opinion about your awesome game.
B001XV3LSS|5.0|I love this movie I can't tell you how many times I've watched it Jodie foster is a great actress and Matthew is incredible
B00C32R64G|5.0|Once again, another great album from these guys. I can't wait to see them in concert for the first time this summer.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Imagine Dragons is quite possibly the best band I've heard in a long while. I have not listened to an album in its entirety and enjoyed it as much as this one since I discovered Breaking Benjamin. Their sound is original, addictive, and ever-changing. You will not listen to the album and be disappointed by the same sound and style in every song. Yes, they do have their own &#34;sound&#34; and &#34;style&#34;, but they aren't afraid to mix it up. The best way I can describe them is as a beautiful mix of rock/metal/electronic. They do it very well, and their lyrics are phenomenal. Every song is packed with meaning and powerful lyrics to accompany some amazing beats.<br /><br />Here's a quick breakdown of their songs on the album:<br />1) Radioactive - this one is one of their best, in my opinion. The music video is highly entertaining as well. It's catchy, has some awesome power, and his voice just shines. It's addictive to listen to, and you will find yourself singing this song at odd times just because it gets stuck in your head.<br /><br />2) Tiptoe - another very good song. It's got more of an upbeat feel to it, and grows with you over time.<br /><br />3) It's Time - This song and Radioactive will no doubt be their most popular. I love It's Time. It's underlying beat is so catchy, reminds me of some kind of Irish music (strangely), and the lyrics and everything blend perfectly together. This one will have you singing it randomly as well.<br /><br />4) Demons - The lyrics are just fantastic in this one...&#34;This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come...&#34; and so much more. It's brilliant. Listen to it.<br /><br />5) On Top of the World - this one sounds dramatically different than the rest of their music, and reminds me of a tropical/Jamaican place, with its tune. It's fun, upbeat, and a good listen.<br /><br />6) Amsterdam - My best friend loves this song, and I think it is good as well, but not their best. It's catchy though in its chorus and throughoutthe song.<br /><br />7) Hear Me - this one just kind of tugs on your heart strings. It's a soul-searching song.<br />A great listen. &#34;I've said it before, I won't say it again, love is a game, it's not pretend&#34; and &#34;Can nobody hear me? I've got a lot that's on my mind!&#34; It's soul-felt and great.<br /><br />8) Every Night - Yes, Imagine Dragons even did a love ballad. And they did it well. The lyrics are so sweet; the chorus is catchy; the beat is consistent and slow, peaceful but determined.<br /><br />9) Bleeding Out - This one just clicks with me. It's a sad(feeling) song, another one like Hear Me. The lyrics and the tone are packed with emotion. You can feel the pain in the underlying tone.<br /><br />10) Underdog - another drastic jump from their typical sound. Again has that tropical-y sound, upbeat, fun. It's something you'd expect to hear in a dance club and has more electronica elements.<br /><br />11) Nothing Left to Say / Rocks - this is the only song I'm not crazy about really. It's not that it's bad, just that it doesn't call out to me like a lot of their other songs. I'm sure others would like it, so give it a try. It's slow, and again a peaceful song. It's still worth listening to, and I don't bother skipping it.<br /><br />Overall, if you're going to be stupid and insist on not buying the entire album (seriously, just buy the entire album), I would say must-haves are Radioactive, Tiptoe, It's Time, Demons, and Bleeding Out. Close behind would be Hear Me and Every Night. The only ones I would even remotely consider skipping (and even then I still wouldn't) would be On Top of the World, Underdog, Nothing Left to Say / Rocks, and Amsterdam.<br /><br />But, since there are five I would never not buy, you're already at the cost of the entire album. Just buy the entire one. There isn't a single disappointing song on there.<br /><br />I'll be keeping an eye on Imagine Dragons for their next album to come, and it will be on pre-order. And I rarely like a band enough to buy even a single song, let alone an entire album.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|This CD is awesome!! There is not a single dud song on it. The only downside is that there are only 11 tracks... I wish all their songs were on it! Lyrics are real and deep, not shallow. Not to the detriment of the music though, the mix of 'real' acoustic sounds makes the sound honest and genuine, along with just enough synth effects to make it rocky and cool. 10/10!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This is a very touching story of a girl who loving and being loved doesn't exactly come easy to. Highly recommended.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|I love the way the corny predictable western/romance plays with both a serious subject and violence. Both the Cohen brothers and Tarantino do this so well. I minus one star for all the blood and gore. I get the point, but I just don't like it. Highly recommended.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|I got this for my 2012 MBA. After installing the drivers from their website. I restarted and everything and it started working!! I have used the apple USB 2.0 before but this one is so much faster!!<br /><br />This is a must for anyone that has USB 3.0 and wants a good Ethernet connection!!
B004Q3UL56|5.0|When I rented this I wasn't sure whether I'd seen it before or not. I had.<br /><br />I also remember enjoying it the first time, but the second time was even better. Maybe in my initial viewing I was distracted by the nudity (tastefully done) or perhaps I'm just slow on the uptake but there was a lot going on that didn't sink in the irst time. The excellent use of music, the subtleties of the characters transitions throughout the film, and the realization that little brother was more than an obnoxious foil; all this escaped me the first time. Perhaps again, I am just a bit dim but I prefer to think I merely let generally  low expectations for the genre prevent me from paying proper attention.  Pay attention. It's worth it.
B007XNAPX4|1.0|DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!<br />This concert is tremendous, but the video quality of the DVD is awful- totally grainy.  A terrible transfer.  ONLY buy the blu-ray, which is superb
B00BLGXL3U|2.0|I've been waiting and waiting for this movie because of the subject matter and the actors.  I think Joaquin Phoenix is one of the best actors of his generation and Phillip Seymour Hoffman has always been a favorite so The Master seemed a perfect fit for me.  So I rented it.  Wow - I wish I hadn't done that!  This was such a long, meandering movie it reminded me of everything Terrance Malick makes. Only - this movie lacked all the beauty Malick brings to the screen. The Master was like watching a bunch of disconnected people dance around one another to music only they can hear in their heads.  I feel cheated by this movie. I'd read so many good things about it. Maybe I'm just not smart enough to know what the heck all the fuss was about.  Was this a movie about Scientology?  Was it about a crazy WWII vet searching for - something? Were these other people real or did he make them up in his head?  I know this movie was nominated for many different awards but I don't think it won any. Good thing.
B00BCOGM78|5.0|I have most of this bands music and I can tell you now this \\"Earth Rocker\\" is one of my Favorites.. Thanks Clutch!
0525953590|5.0|I have read many books on theoretical and particle physics, and this is one of the best.  The book begins with the basics.  This section is not boring or long--just enough, especially for those familiar with the subject.  I especially liked the section on quantum field theory--one of the best explanations I've read.  Also, the sections on renormalization and symmetry breaking were equally well written and explained.  Then Carroll goes into the discovery of the Higgs.  Along with this is a detailed description of how physic discoveries are made--piggy-backing one's discoveries upon another's previous work.  Then an excellent discussion detailing the inner workings of particle accelerators. The massive amounts of data collected and why--even though the mass of the Higgs was well within the Tevatron's energy capabilities--the LHC was the only tool that could have found the Higgs. The book ends with an examination of where the discovery of the Higgs particle will lead: dark energy, supersymmetry, strings and branes.<br /><br />Simply a fascinating read. I rarely write reviews, but I felt compelled to write since this book is so well written and interesting.  Highly, highly recommended.
B000FC10WU|5.0|As always, Miss Marple mysteries are enchanting and very interesting.  I've read her mysteries for many a year and still enjoy every one
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|Elementary takes the two main characters from Arthur Conan Doyle's series and updates them to contemporary New York. Unlike the BBC version, which brings Holmes and Watson to the present day with reworkings of the original stories, this series starts with the characters and their quirks, and moves into almost all new territory.<br /><br />The recurring characters draw you into the series. The storylines haven't been as strong; I watch more for the characters and continued modern interpretations.
B009WJ14FA|5.0|When was the last time you heard a Band that has Great Musicians, A Fantastic Singer, and sounds as good if not better, LIVE.  I have tried to listen to this album sitting down, but after the first 30 seconds, I find myself dancing all around the room. THey look COOL, they play COOL, they Are COOL. I'm bummed they are not touring in the Philly area this summer.I'm 60 years old, with a very eclectic taste in music, it takes a lot for me to be impressed, having grown up during the 60's and being spoiled by all the Great Music of that area. Well, these guys have done it. I've bought 10 copies of this album so far, giving it out to friends and Family. THey have toured as the opening act for the Who, how COOL is that?
B00B89WXYS|5.0|I absolutely love Native by OneRepublic. I have been listening to them for years and their work only continues to get better and better. Definitely worth the purchase!
B001TKD4ZI|4.0|I liked it. Long enough to flesh out and define characters. Interesting and with enough action to keep you reading. Very low sizzle factor. There is some romance, but only once, and well past the half way mark. So if your more into vampires, mild romance, decent action(things get blown up and bad guys are all over), you'll like it. If your taste is more with 'rated R' or above, you probably won't be so happy.<br /><br />Excellent editing! Spelling, grammar, structure are all at printed publishing standards or above.
B00B0ND67K|4.0|Never heard this group before and their sound reminds me of Little Big Town or Gloriana.  Nice vocals and harmonies. Liked them.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|The story. The way the author patiently introduced the characters and skillfully developed their relationships. The sincerity of emotion. The subtle, unforced humor. The honesty of being human. The care taken with a delicate subject. The magnetism of the story. My love for the characters. This book is excellent.
B00BF11STU|3.0|Can't explain why, but I expected more. It was okay...kind of slow in spots. It isn't one I would go out and buy,but like I said it was okay.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Great series, always something new in each episode, keeps your interest and leaves you wanting more. Enjoy watching with my wife, we do marathons on weekends...
B00APJLFEG|4.0|Cute movie for kids. Some humor that is adult related. I didn't love the small sudden scary moments with Dracula. They scared the crap out of my kids. Still cute and fun overall.
0439023491|5.0|When Suzanne Collins wrote The Hunger Games, and Catching Fire, it's like she writes everything from her heart, as if there is actually 12 districts in a country called Panem. But the settings in North America. But Panem is actually North America after it was burnt up after a humongous fire. So if I just went in the \\"future\\" I would find myself in the country Panem and it's 12 Districts that are under the Capitol's rule.<br /><br />I like Catching Fire, I guess a bit more than The Hunger Games, because this one is more daring, exciting, more mysterious and shocking. Thanks to Suzanne Collins this is one unforgettable book. To me it practically tops all the other books I've read, and that's something.<br /><br />Join Katniss as she may fall back into the arena with Peeta. Will luck save her again? Or will she be killed in the bloody Quarter Quell Hunger Games by the other winning tributes.
B003PIUBYY|5.0|I love the song Pusherman.  Superfly was one of the few \\"blacksploitation\\" films I actually enjoyed, and this album brings back fond memories of simpler times.  The recording is decent, and the music is funky - what more do you want?
0439023513|4.0|As Ms. Collins writes `Hunger Games', `Catching Fire', and 'Mockingjay', she writes out feelings, making the book have a little of it's own special uniqueness that makes me want to read it over and over again. It takes real skill to write a masterpiece, and with these books Ms. Collins has created a few.<br /><br />Out of all three books I like the books `Catching Fire' and `Mockingjay equally. Mockingjay, just confused me a little, since it seemed surprising that Katniss would actually do the things she did. But those are my opinions. Read them all, `The Hunger Games', `Catching Fire, and `Mockingjay', and compare them to see which ones you like the best.<br /><br />Who will Katniss chose, Peeta or Gale? And the biggest part yet, in the end will Katniss put a stop to this evil? Read the Mockingjay to find the end of this thrilling adventure.
B001G5ZNDW|5.0|It's rare that great music and excellent recording come together in the same LP, but this is one of those special occasions.  Even after nearly 50 years, this recording still holds up.  Five stars for both the performance and the sound quality.  I can't stop playing it.  A true classic.
0439023521|5.0|Other reasons that I like The Hunger Games is because it is a very engaging book. It's engaging because there are parts that surprise the reader like when Prim is chosen for the Hunger Games. As Katniss fights for her life she avoids gangs such as the Careers. The Careers are from the districts, 1, 2, and 3. And surprisingly Peeta has joined their side. So now Katniss, and her new ally Rue from district 11 have to fight the Careers or any other team of people to win. Or will they have an unexpected surprise?<br /><br />Will Katniss survive the Hunger Games? Or will she die along with 22 other tributes? Read the book, The Hunger Games. And watch the slightly bloody fight between 24 people and their hunger to live ....
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This is an important film on this sad time in Mexico's history. Well acted and written and close to exact events.
B004H4XAXO|3.0|I bought this book looking for a saga that I wouldn't burn through in a night or two and I got what I paid for. Thankfully though it wasn't so un-gripping that I couldn't be bothered finishing it.<br />As per my review title I think the series has a lot of promise but due to the size of the saga Sanderson wants to create a lot of the pace is sacrificed in this first book in setting the scenes.<br />Worth a read, and worth it if it means a long running story about characters I have already grown to love.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I love reading anything set in Scotland, Ireland and England.  This had the charm and descriptions I expected.  The book kept me entertained and had all the necessary things to keep it going; funny, sad, and entertaining.  The ending was a surprise for me, not your typical one.  I enjoyed the subject since it was not my typical read.
B009QW85ZU|5.0|For me Sean Connery was James Bond in this movie. Twenty years later and Connery still had it. I enjoyed this movie.<br /><br />I watched it from Amazon Instant Videos.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I bought Seasons 1 through 9 for my son for Christmas last year.  We just watched the very last episode of Season 9 and, of course, it left us hanging so we HAD to buy Season 10, Episode 1.  We were not disappointed.  We plan to buy the entire Season 10 once it is available as a set.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I find it difficult to understand why a group of individuals, dedicated to believing in the teachings of Jesus Christ, would feel justified in treating and abusing children in this manner.<br />A well written book that reminds us of the inhumanity to man by man.
B00BF123WG|4.0|this was a good movie, but it was too long. My wife also didn't like the torture scenes. It is worth watching though.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|IT WAS SUCH AN AMAZING PLOT LINE I LOVED IT!!!!! THE WAY THE CHARACTER`S PERSONALITIES DEFINED THE STORY WAS GENIUS! BUT OH MY GOD CLIFF HANGER WHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY????!!
B00480OHWK|5.0|Always my favorite children's book and Seuss book. I went to a baby shower where books (for baby) were being given instead of cards. I didnt want to write the simple 'to baby, from cousin'. So I came up with a sweet and meaningful inscription for the inside cover:<br /><br />Sometimes you will feel lost and that's ok.<br />Let this story forever remind you<br />that you belong somewhere...<br />and to Someone.<br />Your Mom is, and will always be,<br />your Best Friend.<br /><br />With Love,<br />Your cousin Lindsay<br /><br />(Date of shower)<br /><br />It brought tears to Mom-to-be and Grandma's eyes. (And my mom's too.)
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|The author knows how to bring out emotions in the reader and describe love.  Keep the tissue close by.  You will need it.  Best book ever.
B009178OQA|3.0|I love sushi; but Jiro's method have been copied all over the world. It has become common place. NYC has the best sushi place
B009YG2ND8|5.0|While some may find the price too high, you are getting a full length game that works superbly on the Kindle Fire.  I have no complaints as of yet.  Never played FF3 so looking forward to completing the story.  Buy it and enjoy!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Jennifer is a very good actor. Love her. The theme is stupid but who cares. I don't. Editing is excellent!
B007IK44CK|3.0|good movie, but what i expected from Tom Cruise.  good story line full of action and suspense. good option for a quick pick.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|If I may ask to have the audio should be available in all language instead of just in English, would it be too much demanding?<br />That will earn my last star.
B001UV4XUG|5.0|I ordered expedited shipping because I was going on a trip and just a few days after I ordered the DVD, I received it in the mail. The disc did not have a scratch on it and played perfectly and the original case was even included. The movie was sad, hilarious, sweet, quirky, and just wonderful. One of my favorites. Thank you very much!
B0081336FO|1.0|Too much glorification of Hollywood's penchant for pandering to violence as a way to get attention.  I liked the old Sherlock Holmes series MUCH better.
B005S9EKCW|2.0|The movie was wonderful beyond words. The problem I had was that I had to return the package to Amazon three times because the audio on the Blu-ray disk had serious problems. The sound would drop out at unexpected times. I finally asked for a refund that Amazon handled very well. Other Blu-ray disks play well on my player with no problem. I would gladly have rated the movie a 5 for its content. I only wish that the production of the Blu-ray would have been done with better quality control. In the entire matter, my dealing with Amazon was excellent.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|great series.  worth keeping and not renting.  this product worked as expected - great.  that makes me happy.  thank-you.  product arrived on-time and easy to use.  very good
B006GHA9VQ|5.0|I have been an Andrew Lloyd Webber fan for years, and I was not disappointed by this play, The Blu-ray quality was excellent, and the whole thing was an enjoyable experience.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|This is an excellent movie about a rich man crippled from the neck down who hires a man just out of prison to take care of him.  In France, a parolee has to have a paper signed to prove that he's looking for a job before he can get government assistance.  To one parolee's surprise, he's hired.  Both the parolee, who was born in Africa, and the rich man, who used to be very athletic, have things to learn from each other.<br /><br />Beware, there is another French movie &#34;Les Intouchables&#34; based mostly in India dealing with the caste system in India.  It's not nearly as good as the film reviewed here.  I got the India version first by mistake.
0810993139|5.0|I would recommend any parent to buy this book to their school-age children. My 8 year old loves it and he read it in no time. This whole &#34;Wimpy kid series&#34; is great for elementary school children!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Easy and fun. Never have any issues with this one which makes it a fave. More addictive than Candy Crush.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Great Book,What you would expect from Flynn. If you read any of the previs storys you'll like this one. RD

B0091REZMW|3.0|i enjoy hidden object games however I don't like always running out of energy or having to buy items to continue playing.
B002W7H3EA|5.0|All the hallmarks of the great Hitchcock films, with a stellar performance by Cary Grant, and the most sizzling on-screen magnetism between Grant and Eva Marie Saint..
B004J4WKTW|3.0|I found myself rushing through the book to get to the point. I really enjoyed the latter part of the book. I wouldn't recommend it.
B00AKOB7CG|1.0|I downloaded this last night and have tried to access it 5or 6 times and can't even access it! In addition to that , it freezes my entire kindle!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I hope this is more than just a story, a reflection of life as it's meant to be lived...it would take a dog to realize such a simple truth. Brought tears to my eyes. Thank you.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite books. I really like Kate Morton as an author and have enjoyed most of what she has written. Her novels are well written and keep you turning the pages until you get to the twist at the end. This one does not disappoint in that regard. I also like how she goes back and forth between the various characters, but you can't let her work languor (like you could anyway) or you can get confused about who did what. \\"The Secret Keeper\\" is on par with \\"The Forgotten Garden,\\"  another favorite.  I didn't like \\"The Distant Hours\\" as much as these two, however. It seemed too contrived and kind of too \\"out there\\" to be believable.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I don't like to write long reviews (or reviews in general), so don't expect a plot summary or detailed description.  The Broadway show was, by far, my favorite show of all time (saw it twice).  I was in awe.  I also loved the movie, even though I disagree with some choices.  They made some unnecessary changes to some major songs that I disagreed with.  They left out parts of Fontines' death song, made some word changes to the finale (I would have liked Eponine to join Fontine and come floating down as angels) and made other changes.  I would have left the songs as they were.  I was also a bit disappointed in Russell Crowe's performance - both his acting and singing.  In addition, though I loved the sets and photography, I would have held the long shots longer in &#34;One Day More&#34; and the &#34;Finale&#34; and done fewer rapid face shots.  These differences aside, I loved all of the other performances and was amazed that these famous actors could sing so well and do it while acting at the same time - all done live, not dubbed.  The performances were spectacular and I agree with the Oscar to Anne Hathaway.  She was brilliant.  I loved Hugh Jackman, as well, and Elizabeth Barks was terrific as Eponine.  I was totally moved by this motion picture and started an ovation at the end of the movie, joined by the others in the theater.  Even with my picking at certain differences, this was my favorite movie of the year (close with Argo and The Life of Pi) and I give it 5 stars.  I may have been a bit prejudiced by my love for the show in the first place.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I love being able to binge watch  the episodes with no commercials. the story lines and acting are so good.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Great game when you have hours of time to spend!! I recommend this game to all my friends to play
B00AEFYCL4|3.0|I had high expectations for this movie based on other reviews I read. However, I found that the story-line dragged at times, and the way the movie jumped back and forth in time was occasionally disjointed. The acting was quite good and helped the movie a lot.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|this is the best british porgram in ages we loved every one of them can't wait to get season 4 of them
B004SEUIW4|4.0|I really enjoyed the storyline... it felt like reality. I thought the performances were mostly good... especially the leads Jesse Eisenburg and Kristen Stewart. However, I feel the story would have been just as effective without 2/3 of the F-words. This film is definitely not for anyone who is disturbed by offensive language.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Such an addicting book,I loved every page. I highly recommend this book, I say you take even an hour out of your day to read this book..
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love having the Bible handy when I need it. Could be easier to get around in. I had to go to &#34;Help&#34; to find out how to find a new passage. I entered John 3:16 in the search and it said there were no results. ?!
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|I ENJOY THE GAME, BUT I WISH IT HAD MORE OF A STORYLINE TO THE GAME. ESSENTIALLY, ITS JUST A FUN PICK 3 GAME.
B005IKZ1B0|5.0|This is my favorite album of the year. I'm really happy I downloaded the entire album, it was more than worth it.
B005HSL626|5.0|This is a fun game! It's great for kids and adults alike. It's a really adicting game, once you start playing you don't want to put it down.
B000IZ0KRK|5.0|What a beautiful love story that unfortunately suffered the slings and arrows of the times and the politics of the times.
B00785P2QC|4.0|The directions are unclear and makes the game confusing at times...but overall fun game and very catchy my boyfriend loves these games and can play them all day
B003ZSJ212|5.0|AMAZING it only took how many years, but none the less was WELL WORTH THE WAIT!!!  The movie that started it all for most of us sic-fi geeks can now be seen/heard as it was meant to be.<br /><br />A must have for all fans
B005IQZB14|5.0|For any one that has lost someone and felt it so deeply, it is a moving and incredible testament to the will of the human spirit.  The story of Cheryl and what she did is awe inspiring in so many ways.  Thankfully by reading this book you get to view the PCT from her pages and don't lose any toe nails doing it!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book makes you feel every possible emotion -- and question each and every one.  Courtroom drama, thriller and deeply impactful psychological profile.
B00C2VIA52|2.0|Not bad per se but either you spend hours playing over and over the same battle or you have to spend real money to buy good cards. It would be great if the game was just sold for a few dollars instead of being &quot;free&quot;.
B009HEP41A|3.0|IT IS SOMEWHAT BORING. i WOULD NEVER PUT THIS IN THE CD PLAYER WHILE DRIVING. iT COULD PUT ONE TO SLEEP
B008AK8FHM|3.0|It is very much like a text book with all the medical and neurological facts. I wasn't convinced when I finished the book that it gave Proof of Heaven which is the title. It was interesting and fairly well written but  not a book I would want to go back to and read again.
B009A9EPLM|4.0|THE MUSIC IS VERY SOOTHING. i WOULD NOT LISTEN TO IT WHILE DRIVING AS IT COULD CAUSE SLEEPYNESS. I WOULD PUT IT THE CD PLAYER BEFORE BED.
B004NELBPC|1.0|Previous Kindle Fire versions of the Huffington Post worked very well. Now the articles can only be read in portrait view; whence most Kindle Fire cover cases display in landscape view.  Now you can only change/view Settings from the Home page; you can't get to Settings from an article.  You can no longer scroll between sections by swiping the heading bar.<br /><br />I hate it when some corporate VP approves \\"upgrades\\" to a product that \\"downgrade\\" the users experience!
B000ICXQUQ|1.0|Paid to view this and then about 30 minutes in the whole thing froze up.  Tried resetting everything and it played for another 30-60 seconds and froze up again.  kind of sucked for family movie night.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I can read my books from my phone! I can carry my ereader easily in my purse so it's always available.
B008QE9XD2|2.0|the content of this movie was as immoral as it is. I found it repulsive and it went into the trash. I thought it would be more like the original series. Not my sort of fare, I guess.
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|My third cut the rope and still as fun as the first. Exercise for the brain too. Now if work was just as fun!
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|Great book exciting and full of adventure. The author keeps you guessing what is going to happen next.  I recommend ut
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Wow!  What a story!  It was a truly gripping story with a great description of the characters. I felt sad for all of them.  There were lots of twists and turns that kept the reader on the edge of his/her seat.
B003LQ3YXU|2.0|This is science fiction that does not appeal to me.  Really far out situations.  Do not like it even though it is free on Amazon Prime.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Fantastic movie for a great price! This movie is wonderful and being able to have it delivered the day it came out without going anywhere was great! If you like musicals this is a good movie for you!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Its amazing the best app ever.  Great for ideas a laugh or for planing the future. Easy to use. Easy to get addicted so watch out,
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I loved this movie as it was &#34;powerful&#34; as seen on the cover. Denzel played the part of the pilot convincingly, and the end was perfect!
B002QRWJA4|5.0|Gerard Butler was fabulous, as were the other actors!  Loved this movie.  Apparently he did his own singing too.  Would highly recommend.

B005GFPZYK|5.0|Loved this book. It was an easy read and very honest. America is at a loss to be without this  hero.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|i cant get enough of anna and christian one of the best books ever cant wait to see what else eljames writes
B004IAIXWK|5.0|One of the best movies that Channing Tatum has been in.  He can really dance.  The music, the dancing, and the plot was very entertaining.
0439023521|5.0|I read this book before it got huge, before it was a major motion picture, a phenomenon, a world-wide success, a new-york times bestseller. And I loved it before all that as well.
B0013V3GN8|5.0|I love to watch the great Elvis Presley and this was very entertaining and informative.. If you love Elvis you will love this movie.
0316232955|5.0|A lot of books claim laugh-out loud and such, but really its more of an internal half-grin. THis one had me laughing my ass off the whole book...Great!
B008Q09QT2|5.0|I love everything about this movie.  The scenery, music,dancing and a little bit of history.  I have watched it several times, and I'm sure that I will watch it again.  I have the digital copy and want to buy the dvd.
B001OKCT2M|4.0|This is a great movie if you are stuck at the airport or enduring a weather related delay. The action keeps your attention and Sandra Bullock is always satisfying eye candy. Income tax issues aside, Wesley Snipes is a great villian and this is one of Slys best!!
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|Weber has done it again!  Honor is back and at her best in the marvelous tale. Good enough to read over and over!
B003DXSXCI|5.0|A great McQueen movie. Refreshing to watch and before political correctness ruined our nation. Awesome movie and well worth the time.
B003L77GH4|5.0|I didn't have much hope for this series when I first started watching. I thought it would be just like a lot of others that have turned out disappointing but not this one! I am hooked! This is better than TRUE BLOOD! good acting and good story plots. A DEFINITE BUY!
0385537816|1.0|The package arrived in worst condition...it was damaged and upon opening some pages of the books are damaged on the sides.<br />the book doesnt look new and I am not happy about it.I did not bother returning it because it will be great hassle.
B00005JM4Z|5.0|Excellent and I would recommend for fans to go ahead and buy. You will not be sorry.Just the right amount of action.
B001XV3LSS|5.0|I've always loved this movie - I've seen it on TV several times, but seeing it in HD - Wow!
B000HA4WT8|4.0|To me, it lacked the luster of some of the others in the series.It was good but not as good.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Never saw this movie in theather and i thought i knew the story.. i was wrong.. graphics espcially was very impressive
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I love this series and I will buy each one the day it comes out! Besides the great acting,each episode has more than one thing happening at the same time. Keeps you guessing and wanting more. Most series I will watch and then put away to watch again on down the line. But not this one! I watch the whole season and turn around and watch it again! Ihave 3 seasons and have watched each 3 times. BUY BUY BUY!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This book kept me entertained the whole way through. Lets hope this isn't a glimpse of what could happen in the future.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|Excellent as always.Loved the action.I would recommend to anyone who is into the series, it is worth it and you won't regret it.
B008220C38|2.0|I thought this film was dreadful.<br />It jumped from normal scenes (which in fairness were good) to people acting on a stage.<br />I'm very glad that I didn't pay money at the theatre to see this.
B000VNMMQQ|5.0|I love all the DIE HARD movies and the action in this one is just as good. A good buy.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|As expected this film was great.<br />It's easy to see why it won the academy award.<br />Everything about was brilliant.<br />Acting,location & the way it seemed almost documentary.<br />A must see film in my opinion.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Your team sent this item to me so that I could update my Kindle Fire - it was received promptly and solved the problem I was having with downloading items that I had paid for.  Thank you.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Being slightly older, I have found most games to be a bit lack luster. I agree with another reviewer that this game is reminiscent of Myst, most notably the graphics. What separates these is the ability to manipulate the beautiful puzzle boxes. Without using the hints, it could take some time to figure out the steps necessary to reveal the next piece of the puzzle, not a bad thing. Its nice to have finally found a game that challenges the imagination.<br /><br />Truly a wonderful game, I can't wait for the next episode!
B005LAII12|2.0|This movie was recommended to me, so I gave it shot this weekend.  BIG mistake.  \\"Ted\\" is the story of an 8-year old boy who wishes a Christmas wish that he and his teddy bear would n'er be parted, or some BS like that.  Anyway, his wish comes true, his teddy bear comes to life, and they remain best friends.  Flash-forward a couple of decades, and Ted and John are still friends; however, there's a BIG difference now in Ted.  He has become a foul-mouthed, pot-smoking, liquor swilling, womanizer.  I guess anything is possible.<br /><br />Set McFarland directed, produced, co-wrote, and voiced the title character in this very unfunny excess in everything.  I didn't anticipate a 5-star movie, but I was left scratching my head and asking the questions:  who really wanted to watch this?; who thought the concept would be funny?; and why would Mark Wahlberg lower himself to appear in it?  For those of you that may not be aware, McFarland created the animated series \\"The Family Guy.\\"  What MIGHT work for 30 minutes, grows REAL tired REAL fast in a movie that logs in at just under two hours.  Oh, McFarland tries to polish his t*rd, but as we all know REGARDLESS of what you do to a t*rd, you're still left with a T*RD.  Why ANY woman would want to waste her time on a man who still \\"hangs\\" with his teddy bear and is obviously more interested in getting stoned, drunk, and wallowing in excess is beyond me.<br /><br />This movie wasn't funny nor touching.  All it was was a shining of example of how some industry folk wouldn't recognize what makes a good movie if their lives depended on it.  NOTE TO PARENTS:  This is NOT a movie for kiddies.  It is loaded with womanizing, sex, drug use, and profanity that even made me uncomfortable.  This version is unrated and a complete waste of time.
B00881PTRC|5.0|Hangman has never been so fun. The animations are funny and keep me coming back. Played it many times and the words have yet to repeat.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|The Bourne Trilogy is a modern day classic spy movie series! I replaced my DVD set with Blue-Ray and I'm completely satisfied with the upgrade.  The picture quality is much sharper(on an HD TV) and there are some additional extra features as well.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I am new at this tech. stuff. I am learning and it is fun. Haven't done to much with it so far but looking forward to getting organized==paperless.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I can play this game over and over! It's simple, yet can be challenging.  The graphics are cartoonie, but it works well with the theme of the game.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I have this on my kindle fire and phone. I love drawing and playing with my daughters and my grandchildren and my daughters boyfriend.
B001QB5S3G|5.0|Perhaps I like this movie so much becuase I have studied Spanish Colonial History and know something of the plight of the Jesuits.<br />I also know something about the Indians used in this movie and would highly recommend watching the Special features regarding how the movie was made and how natural the Indians took to their role in the film.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am really enjoying this App. I have it in my Kindle fire. I like the fact that I can take it with me and not a bulky bible to carry around. I am still finding out what all I can do with it.
B00001U0E1|5.0|I have been interested in theater much of my life and believe that Shakespear needs to be seen rather than read.<br />This movie lets you experience what it must have been like in Shakespear's time.
B000FVQLQQ|5.0|I am a psych major and was required to review this film for a class. Excellent psychological depictions throughout the film.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love to sit at my computer and read KJV version in large enough print and not have eye strain, excellent product!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|This season as a whole was interesting and frustrating. Some of the characters continue to make decisions that don't make sense. Over the length of the season I felt less invested in their situation, but I never wanted to stop watching.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is for my wife, who loves to learn new things to share with me and others about recipies and simple solutions.
B00C32REYI|5.0|I was a big fan of the first record. This one continues the textured sounds that I liked so much on the first record, but moves a little further into the R&B area. The lyrics are simple and repetitive, but that works because the music is layered and complex. Will likely be one of my favorites of the year.
0385537670|5.0|Was very entertaining and even humorous.  Enjoy this author's style very much and am half way through the second book.  It was also very moving and touching.  Highly recommend this book.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|Tegan and Sara's last 2 albums were filled with great personal songs. This one is not too far from that in the since of the songwriting, but it adds to the mix a more pop friendly sound. It's catchy and dancy and you'll sing along.
B006LSZECO|3.0|When I first picked this book up, I was enthralled - the characters were interesting and the plot kept me on the edge of my seat.  But somewhere along the way - about three quarters of the way through - it just fell apart. When I finished it, I just stared at the book for a couple of minutes - I couldn't believe that it ended on such a flat note.<br /><br />I gave it three stars for the strong start, but overall, it's just sort of ... meh.  It's worth a read, but I definitely wouldn't pay full price for it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book kept me in suspense through the whole reading. Just when I thought I knew what was happening and who was doing what, it changed and I was surprised again.
B008ER9QKG|1.0|LePage had NO idea in his empty head about this.  His production is the worst ever.  The singers here, other than Kaufman, Blythe, are OK, but not much more. The best Rings are still the Kupfer and the Chereau productions.  Kupfer Ring is the very best.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I think this book is only for the people who need it beautiful touching I don't understand it but that's what I love love love people should only read this if they need it<br /><br /><3gymnast
B009YP9L7U|2.0|If you are looking for a quick read, this book is for you. Kind of a different story from my prospective.
0374531269|5.0|A Long Way Gone is a narrative of a 12-year-old child soldier named Ishmael.  He went through many hardships as a child and had seen rape, drugs, and murder. This book had widened my knowledge of what is going on in the world.  Children are kidnapped and force to become child soldiers in Africa.  The children have no choice and protections so are forced to do whatever they are told.<br /><br />It saddened me that a 12-year-old boy had to go through this.  I could not do the things he had to do.  I cannot imagine being forced to kill innocent lives, seeing women get raped, and villages being burnt to the ground.  The more I read the book, the braver I thought Ishmael was.  The things he had to do to survive is unbelievable.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book to everyone.  It was hard for me to read this book without getting emotional.  However, it really widens your perspective of what is going on in the world.  The news is biased and does not cover these kinds of stories.
B005MYEPXC|2.0|Woody, what happened?<br /><br />I nearly fell asleep watching this slow piece and did not finish it.  It was bad enough when it started and only got worse.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I love Picross and the CrossMe series is easily the best version of the game for any Android device. Tons of puzzles, great design, overall good work by the creators.
B00452J5IW|3.0|This album came out in the 60s revolution and marked its zenith.  It's quite interesting to listen to it once more with 50+ year-old ears and more life experience.  It was never a great album although it still has sparks of genius.<br /><br />If you've never heard it, you owe yourself a listen.
B006PHD0RW|4.0|Bag It! offers some solid game play in the vein of Tetris, albeit it with a more limited design. The animation is amusing, the game gets suitably challenging as it continues and it can easily take a few hours & a lot of brain power to beat everything. A solid puzzler, one of the best I've seen on Android.
B007L6VR6M|4.0|The cast in this alone makes it worth getting.<br /><br />The color palette is truly remarkable: Wes Anderson clearly went to a lot of trouble to make everything look right.  The story is fun and acting marvelous.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Once again John Grisham spins a most elaborate tale.  The story is unique and entertaining. The complicated details of the story would seem impossible but it is a fun read.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|It grabs you into the story and keeps you watching it like a book you can't put down. Really good story lines.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This book brought to light the terrible treatment of orphans at the hands of Catholic sponsored orphanages.  Good characters and lovely happy resolution.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|I think people will look back to this book as one of the most influential  books written about diet in our generation.  It is a thorough and practical work on the whys of low carb eating.
B0095P31L6|5.0|Really brings out the potential in Zbrush! Would highly recommend to anyone looking for something new and not stupid. Go see!
0596522347|5.0|this is the most important book for the ones preparing slides for public presentations. this book opened my mind on what great presentation should look like, not just from aesthetic side but from design also.
B001I45UFC|4.0|Better than the movie-so glad I read it!!!! Can't wait to read the<br /><br /> Rest of th he books in the series!!!
B000JZ3TYA|5.0|This is still one of the most intriguing movies I know, with a surprise ending.<br />I don't know anyone who's guessed it.
0374531269|5.0|This book is very amazing and it opens my eyes because I have never thought that the war would have so much impact on the people who lives there and especially children who grow up there. This book is a true story of Ishmael Beah, a yound child soldier in Africa. He was telling us about what he had to do or go through during the war, which I found some of the part very painful and feel sorry for those children who had to suffer. There one part that I still remember, Bash was descripting the horrible event and how I feel about what his dad told him that those people are corruption and they are making the country better, which Bash pointed out the thought of why would those \\"good people\\" hurt eveyone home and lives. After I read that part, I began to think and realize how painful it was to be in the war and how war has become such an unfair thing to people around it. Also, in this book, a lot of females were also a victims of the war as well as children because many of the were rapes or kill, which I found it very heartbreaking.<br /><br />In term of globalization, Long Way Gone has aknowledge me about what happen to children, females, and people in other country in Africa. I would recommend this book to other class and people because this book has gave me a lot of opions about the war, how dangerous and painful it would be. In another words, the true story of Ishmael Bash in Long Way Gone would help us prepare and be aware about what going to happen in the future.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfed isthe best game in the world me and my brother's. Play it all the time we enjoy it so much<br />Play it make a review thank you Karsten
B00BI73CVI|1.0|I only watched it for 15 minutes that was all I could stand and I was sorry I wasted my money.  I do like musicals but I don't like the idea of talking in music especially wirh the lack of any musical talent from any of the performers. The movie was to dark.<br />the worst movie I have seen in years.  Sorry but that is my opinion
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love this game it is awesome.I love that they added ziplines and water falls they are so cool,The ONLY reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is b/c it freezes other than that this game is the bomb!!!!
0316228532|2.0|Let me start by saying I only read 100 pages - but that was enough to convince me that there were way too many characters, they were all boring, and it would be hard to imagine a duller plot!!  If there is such a thing as too much character development, or too much detail - it exists in this book.  There is nothing that makes the reader want to turn the next page - except the belief that surely, soon that marvelous Rowling wit must make an appearance.  But it didn't - at least not in the first 100 pages.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert !!!<br /><br />The plot seemed to have to do with a dispute over a crappy piece of land and which of two townships it should be included in...but wait, as dull as that sounds it gets worse.  This dispute involves the elected officials and small town politics - yawn.<br /><br />Other reviews on here mention something about it being a study in cruelty - how people become cruel.  Maybe - but that doesn't exactly sound like a winner of a plot or theme either.<br /><br />In the end it was just too boring and dreary to continue... but because I liked the HP series so much I gave it 100 pages.
B00C3UUZVE|3.0|My daughter if 5 and I though she was going to like this game. And she does, but for her is just ok. She gets bored with it really quick. I think this game is great for a 3 yr old.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie's way of grappling with issues like: confronting your greatest fear(s); trusting in the Universe and never giving up hope; letting go of attachment to self-identity; accepting life as it is and surrendering to whatever the Universe has in store for you.
B004NOCCEG|3.0|Inside Job is nearly worthless. Those who wish to remain blind and deaf should avoid it. The documentary insinuates that the system of reward and punishment that guides behavior in the U.S. is somehow lacking. I lift my pen in defense of the system.<br /><br />Private property is sacred, and the protection of private property is the cornerstone of the legal system. The question is what is private property? Let me illustrate. Nicholas George Montos, professional thief, died in prison in Massachusetts, December 3, 2008 at age 92, after been denied parole several times. Proudly, he appeared twice in the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list. He was \\"sentenced to death for his role in a 1950 robbery of a Georgia couple. He avoided the electric chair after the sentence was reduced on appeal\\" (Wall Street Journal, December 20, 1998). Montos chose the wrong profession. If instead of thief he had become an investment banker, his life would have been different.<br /><br />In the United States theft is punished severely because it separates the victims from their tangible property: radios, cars, TV sets, etc. Whereas, as in Montos's case, the legal system punishes theft by death, it condones fraud. There is no major harm in using superior cunning and fraud to separate the honest and innocent from their money, because money, mere paper and ink, is not \\"property\\" as TV sets and VCRs.<br /><br />Inside Job is unjustly critical of investment bankers and their pay. This is a big misunderstanding that I presently correct. Investment banking serves to transfer funds from those who wish to postpone consumption, to those who wish to use the funds immediately. For example, teachers saving for retirement willingly postpone consumption. Investment bankers have an immediate urge to snort cocaine, frolic with prostitutes, and spend prodigiously in their favorites toys. To this end, they manufacture worthless securities out of manure, and pay the rating alchemists to proffer that manure is gold, whichis then sold at high prices to teachers' retirement funds. Investment bankers obtain additional profits by shorting the same worthless securities that they sell to their clients. This is all proper, because where fraud is permitted and connived there is a continuous intercourse of buying and selling of securities that lubricates the economy. The teachers wanted to postpone consumption - they got what they wanted. The investment bankers wanted immediate consumption - they also got what they wanted.<br /><br />It is only fitting that investment bankers had to receive trillions of dollars in bail-out funds from which they were obliged to pay themselves billions of dollars in bonuses -some of which went for additional cocaine, prostitutes and other uses that stimulate spending and lubricate commerce.<br /><br />If you say that I offer little in support of my arguments, please note that no investment banker has been jailed in the last 250 years, and none will ever be condemned to death for fraud as George Montos was for theft.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|maybe because of my age, but I had trouble keeping up and it became too intense and caused anxiety for me
B001LM1456|4.0|very good movie to watch lot of action<br /><br />i recomened it to a friend  or somedody close to my family
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is so fun me and my family play this game and the game is realy cool , too I played it all nite once really addicting
B005LAIIGC|5.0|We saw this in the theater, and have the books as well.  We loved this as much at home as we did in the theater.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|There seems to be no way to randomly access the words you want to look up. It's just arraigned like a novel.  What am I missing?
B003QSMCKO|5.0|Action, adventure and a young girl overcoming great odds to save her country and her father. All done with catchy Disney songs and sweeping animation. Really, what's not to like?
B0074MZSWW|5.0|I know this band has been compared to Janis Joplin too many times but it's an adequate comparison. My old man raised me on Joplin, Hendrix, The Doors, and the other Gods of Rock. So when I first heard Alabama Shakes, I was confused. I thought to myself, &#34;What Janis song is that?&#34; I was completely blown away by the sound. These folks are great. If you like an old school sound, buy this album!
B008XFJEE2|2.0|I saw the movie on the big screen when it first came out.  I kind of liked it then, but found it uninteresting to watch again.  The emotional control pretended is too unrealistic and overbearing.  I lost interest.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Does not disappoint!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Bought on a lark...and now I totally love this game.  The touch system makes this a very fast game to play which I love...now I'll be looking for more like this....thanks so much.
B005MDVSZQ|5.0|Yet the writing is so full that we can feel part of this other world.<br /><br />I came to this story by the back door. My first introduction to Somerset Maugham was through the movie \\"The Razor's Edge\\" (1946) staring Tyrone Power as Larry Darrell. I have no idea as to how much it was adapted from the book. Then in 1984 we watched Bill Murray as Larry Darrell. This film lost what magic the 1946 film had. So it was time to read the book. Yes I know very few films can do more than present the essence of a book. Turns out that even the older film wrote Summerset out of some of the scenes.<br /><br />Larry is back from the war (WWI). As with many of us he is left with nagging questions about why one person lives and another must die. This problem leads Larry to search for the answers. He turns down opportunities and takes up a lifestyle to help him find answers.  This story is told or narrated by Somerset Maugham himself. In the book Somerset takes more of an active part in the story. Larry came as close as any of us to the answer, he seeks and we leave him much the same way one enters and leaves your life.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0007PALVQ The Razor's Edge - Gene Tierney]]
B007PTJOV0|5.0|leps world is an awesome game!!!!! I play it all the time. it is so much fun and perfect for kids. its also just like super Mario!!! but the first one is better then the second Bc the second one is just unorganized and confusing
B0088XQDD4|5.0|This is a well paced Hamlet. Filmed in The Round House, Camden, London, England, UK. Is minimalist and depends on acting to carry the play. We never see Old Hamlet so again we depend on acting.<br /><br />Another thing that sets this presentation above most is not the words we all know by heart but the way the lines are delivered and that which is not said but implied. This version also leaves in the politics that wrap the &quot;The Tragical History of Hamlet Prince of Denmark.&quot; We forget that Hamlets problem take place in a larger political arena.<br /><br />I did notice that all the males and none of the females exhibit a full beard.<br />Well with the exception of Rosencrantz or Guildenstern.<br /><br />A synopsis, Old Hamlet conquered Old Fortinbras seizing Fortinbras' land. Now that Old Hamlet is dead, Young Fortinbras wants his land back and is willing to take it by force. Meanwhile back in D&auml;nemark Prince Hamlet who is excessively grieving the loss of his father, the king, gets an interesting insight from his father's ghost. Looks like Old Hamlet was a victim of a &quot;murder most foul&quot;; it appears his mother and uncle were in cahoots on the murder. On top of that they even get married before the funeral meats are cold.<br /><br />Everyone will have a different favorite presentation written or acted. Yet this version stands alone as unique and worth adding to your library.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is addicting.  Just when you think you're only going to do one more run and then go to bed, you look at the clock and you've done 50 more.  Great game!
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Excellent story and direction.  Tarantino is superb.  One objection: portrayal of Brunhilda seemed misogynistic.  Too bad to have a brilliant hero have to be supported by such a female stereotype.  Why would the hero be so in love and risk all for such a weak and helpless one?  One would think he would want as partner, someone who could meet his courage and strength.
B006ZDU7QI|4.0|I wouldn't compare this to some of the truly great ones. But I thoroughly enjoyed listening to it, and still do.<br />Obviously this album contains the world famous 'Somebody That I Use to Know', a tune that once stuck in your head is difficult to get rid of.<br /><br />But the rest of the album contains some very nice music as well. I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Mind you, the artist is neither Mozart nor Freddy Mercury, but don't let that stop you from enjoying this.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|The movie was great escapism in a futuristic world, i.e., science fiction. The story is good and riveting. It does start a little slow but you are creating a whole world and some necessart background and character development is why the start of the movie is slow. While I am not a huge Cruise fan, he does a great job in the movie as do the other actors. I found myself thinking of the movie for days after, always a good sign. It does not spoon feed the audience but makes you think some, which is makes the movie all the better. Ending is good.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|A quirky film but quite engaging. In addition to the excellent  acting, pay  attention to the colors. Good music too.
B00BHMF578|3.0|It's a good film, maybe a great film, but definitely not the best picture of the year! The academy of motion pictures and arts has yet again made another strange decision. Nevertheless, a film worth watching that does a nice job of blending truth/history with a bit of hollywood added excitement to make the whole thing very entertaining.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Harry Bosch is one of my favorite fictional characters and this book is no exception.  What a detective and what a story line!  Michael Connelly is a wonderful story teller who can keep you turning the pages with no stopping.
B004NELBPC|3.0|It's become more of a scandal sheet with misleading headlines and often poorly written articles. It's just a bit of a laugh for me. The &#34;Style&#34; section focuses on so-called &#34;stars&#34; and &#34;The Royals&#34; written for a teen audience.  That's just one example of a change for the worse over the last year or so.
B007URVZJ6|1.0|I ordered this download and never got it to work and never heard back on email.  My time is very limited so I was not able to pursue this in a manner which supported its perceived value.  In other words I could not afford to \\"spend\\" time and money on an item that cost little and produced nothing.  If the producer of this product wants to reach back to me they know how to reach me, but for now I am totally not in support of this download and the lack of support...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's absolutely genial and above all is fun. The game is easy to use and good for all ages. Enjoy it.
0062238868|3.0|The story was written by a true American hero.  He was obviously passionate about fighting for his country.  The writing was raw and to the point.  Although I would expect real war jargon and profanity, it almost seemed forced in many cases as filler as the story was slow to progress.  Interestingly, when the action was built up, it was absent or could have better placed.  I also felt the authors wrote down to the reader and kept things too simple by over-explainging military jargon, going  over acronyms multiple times, and sentence structures that weren't convincing.  For example, I realize the book was straight from the heart of someone who has been to battle and wanted to be seen as true to himself, but I didn't find value in the book when sentences start with \\"Y'all.\\"  I found most of my disappointment with the editing.  There were heartfelt additions from his wife, Taya, that seemed randomly added.  There seemed to be very little transition before or after each addition from her and I spent too much time asking why a passage was in a particlular spot.  The last addition to the book was probably the best case where there was an explanation whey her excerpts related to the topic that was there, but it was too late.  I thought the story jumped around and missed transitions and flow--often times, it was too disjointed in meshing the storyline together.  For example, with the war becoming inevitable, they spent far too many pages talking about a dune buggy.  I would have rather have better understood the mind of a sniper at this point int he story.  As editors, I would have asked the writer to go deeper into his thoughts.  Instead, it was shallow with comments that come across as nonchalant \\"I'm trained to kill\\" prose that only scratched the surface.  It was only after his wife's narratives that left me wanting to understand what may be going on in his head.  I saw glimpses of this when Chris discussed patriotism when you finally saw the genuine feelings come out about what this country means to him--and for that, we are all thankful. There were parts emotionally when I felt what Chris Kyle was effectively conveying how he felt on the battle field, but it was slow to find true emotion when he discussed his family until the latter part of the book.  Overall, it was a slow start with a few interesting parts with action.  Ultimately, it could have been organized to tell a better story with more descriptive action and emotion.<br />- Thomas Dowd, author of \\"The Transformation of a Doubting Thomas\\"out what this country means to him--and for that, we are all thankful.

B0090SI460|5.0|My son loves this movie and I have to admit so do I you cant beat the price! Cant wait for the new movie
B0071XO8RA|3.0|But then it falls off.  I would've like to see the same intensity throughout the book.  It became a pretty slow read around the middle.
078322611X|4.0|For a full description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some thoughts on this Kevin Costner movie...<br /><br />Field Of Dreams (1989) stars Kevin Costner, James Earl Jones, Amy Madigan, Burt Lancaster, Ray Liotta, and Frank Whaley.  It's a good baseball fantasy movie.  The 1919 Black Sox are featured in this movie, which I think is cool.  I'm a fan of the Deadball Era in general, so seeing players from the 1900s and 1910s was neat.  The acting in this movie is OK.  The best acting comes from Ray Liotta in his role as \\"Shoeless\\" Joe Jackson.  I thought Amy Madigan was a little over the top, bordering on camp.  This is one of those movies that requires the viewer to really, I mean REALLY suspend disbelief.  I found it rather strange that Costner and Madigan's characters had virtually no reaction when Joe Jackson suddenly appeared.<br /><br />While I think The Natural (1984) is not only the best baseball fantasy movie ever, but the best baseball movie ever, Field Of Dreams is good as well.  But it's not in the same league (no pun intended) as The Natural.  Still, a solid baseball movie.
0399534601|2.0|Sometimes there's little more than a sentence on any one page.  I also expected a better, more inspiring layout inside.  The cover promises more than the inside of the book delivers.
B005IQZB14|1.0|This was less of a story about finding herself and just a tale of where she walked and who she met. Not very deep in thought. For an Oprah endorsed book, I am very disappointed.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|If this is just one of the songs on the album - I can only imagine what the album will be like!  Wow!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I love every thing about this series. It's actors,  characters, and the plots.  And the fact that so far they reach a verdict every episode and don't leave you hanging.
B006GWO5NE|3.0|Why can't there be ONE USB cable that works with all Kindle devices, as well as ALL other things that need to be connected to a computer (camera, earphones, speakers, etc.) so one didn't have to go searching for the correct hook-up as needed (or to replace the one that went missing?)
B006LSZECO|4.0|I didn't like the ending. I just left me hanging and I don't like that at all. Maybe a sequel will be nice.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Great cast and plot.  Love the different court cases and how they turn from bad to good.  I started to watch it just to see something different and couldn't stop watching.  A must see for anyone who likes court drama.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|It does what it promises although the glue on the back to tape it to the wall lasted only a week
0307730697|5.0|This book is unlike any other I've ever read.  Wow.  I wish I had 1% of this guys courage and determination.
B003U4UPTE|5.0|Very exciting series, keeps you wanting more.  Makes it nice to be able to just watch the next episode and not wait a week or more for the out come ;-). Start it at the beginning of a uneventful weekend!
B009KHCT94|3.0|HITLER REALLY?.WHY NOT SOMEONE MORE ENTERTANING AS A ACTOR. DID THEY NEEDED TO USE SOMEONE WHO HAVE DONE MASS MURDER IN OUR PAST!
B00336G7HI|5.0|It is exactly same with the battery of many sony comcorders! It promises usage of Sony HDRPJ580V /580/260V/260! It is really helpful for my travelling.
034580404X|5.0|This set of books were delivered on time! Even though the characters are fictional, I feel that most adults that read this set will be able to relate to them! The set has a very good story line with plenty of action! The author I am very glad decided to write and have them published, first time writer! I feel the others thoughts that this set needs to be placed next to classic writings! I have enjoyed reading them! I will be buying future sets for gifts from Amazon.com Thank You!
B008Y7DWC4|1.0|Very stupid and boring effects. Its was so boring. Very boring not scary poor effects so bad it was not even funny.
B000002PCS|5.0|I found this wonderful soundtrack of one of my favorite movie at Amazon.com! I am so very happy with this cd! As I listen to this well made cd I recall the scenes of this fantastic movie! This cd is filled with very relaxing music which I highly recommend this to ones who enjoy classical music! Thank you!
B003ZFCBJ0|5.0|Loved the movie but not as good as the book! I enjoyed being able to watch it quickly and easily on my Kindle HD. Thanks Amazon!!
B005ILYWN2|4.0|I first came across this movie as an odd recommendation from a friend.  I happen to enjoy cheesy horror/sci fi but this one turned out surprisingly good.  The acting, CGI, and story came together remarkably well and created an even better movie experience.  I liked it so much that I actually bought a copy to add to my personal collection!
0385344228|5.0|Who did it?  Is Jacob really that messed up?  This book will leave you wondering.  Please read it and come to your own conclusions.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Superb acting, gorgeous sets and costumes, beautiful period piece, gripping drama - never a dull moment! The plot really holds your attention.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I have also played the game when it came out on the ds. It has came a long way but it still doesn't loose my interest at all.
B008ALAHA4|4.0|It simply works. Feels solid, looks like a perfect match and fit. Magnet is strong. Not a complete ripoff for a proprietary item.
B00637UISI|5.0|I am a secret twi-hard and love the saga. I absolutely love this product (obviously). The delivery of the product was very fast also.
B002CIMKHO|5.0|Very poignant story. Well done. Getting through life with all that presents itself in the past now and in the future is challenge to all young and old.
B003P8BB5W|5.0|As always the Twilight Saga works it's magic. I am a middle aged TWI-HARD, and no matter how many times I watch this video I always find something new.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Great features. The only thing keeping this away from 5 stars is the lack of the NRSV.  And I'd love to see the New Jerusalem Bible, as well. But you wouldn't go wrong downloading this app.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|I waited for an evening that I could sit and enjoy this movie without interruption.  I was sure hoping for more than what I got.<br />I did like learning about the 13th Amendment and the acting was very good.  However, the whole movie was very dark and boring and I just kept waiting for it to get better.  Best part of the movie is when it ended. Glad I only spent $4.99 to rent it.
B0064MGU98|5.0|The writing, acting, and production quality is excellent.  Better yet, the viewer easily gets pulled into the character lines and plots.
B008RKGF1I|5.0|this was the first time i watched it on a kindle i always loved the movie!It reminds you of life sometimes!
B005MLOOJA|5.0|This series has been really addictive.  On par with any top flight dramas we have watched.  We would recommend this to our friends.
B005K17RU0|5.0|It was hard to find a weather app that worked in my area in japan (which was in English) and looked good so this was my final answer. Great app works flawlessly
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I love weather and the science that goes with it. I like this because I get detailed weather in many areas of the area were I have family and friends.
B00821OX98|4.0|Imagine The Walking Dead with aliens instead of zombies. The characters are similar and its a weekly test of can the humans get along with each other well enough to survive. There's a guy in there just like Merle, another one just like the govenor, etc. Sometimes the characters do things that you just don't believe they would really do in that circumstance, but its still interesting.
B004SDEP38|4.0|I've use this app on my Iphone and Kindle Fire and absolutely love it.  I mainly use to write and update data when away from the house, so not sure how it works with inserting pics, etc...  I use my laptop for that anyway.  I love how it suggest words when typing - big time saver.  I would have given this app a five star if it allowed me to open my Skydrive docs - it does allow google docs, so that works.  I also think that syncing the app on your pc and tablet or smartphone has too many glitches.  I finally just removed the sync application from my computer and just use google docs now.  I do recommend it - good app!
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Sandra Bullock was perfect for this roll. This is based on a true story, and it gave viewers a 'feel good ending.'
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Honestly this is one of the best books I've ever read. King never fails to amaze me. I recommend it to anyone
B000OVLINI|4.0|this book was reccomended to me by a friend. I am glad I looked into it. somewhat simple writing, but great story.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|it is great . it helps me wake pleasantly every day. I like the music options. it is also very convienent. thank yo
B00B19DW0E|2.0|this movie is not worth the loss of the time that it took to watch it.  bad acting and even worse plot.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|This is a great game and I enjoy it, but strangely I would get on and see my table and chairs disappear or move around. It is very annoying.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|Four stars for good drama and four stars for history.  I think I would have enjoyed it more and learned more if the quality of the download were better.  Because I'm, shall we say &#34;adverse&#34;, to the crowds in a movie theater, I waited until I could watch Lincoln at home.  The movie was paused many times while the download caught up.  This was so distracting that concentration on the story line was near impossible.<br /><br />The credits claimed that the movie was based on Doris Kerns Goodwin's A Team of Rivals.  I think they must have said that as a joke.
B00CDT41RY|3.0|Good action movie but with a weak plot. Jamie fox and cast did well.  It was an interesting twist on slavery in the south,  and the stugle of a black man in search for his wife.  Though the plot was thin, it still made for an intertaining movie. NOT MY FAVORITE MOVIE OFF THE YEAR BUT DOES RATE 3 STARS.
B00AQM8H9I|2.0|Neat concept and fun game.  I just lost interest in it very quickly. Should be a free game because it is not really worth a buck.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|Various electronic components of biking require these batteries.  One packet contains enough batteries to run all the accessories for the whole year - excellent!
B004UID2LC|4.0|My Kindle Fire HD let's this app run smoothly with no trouble. I would recommend it. Believe me or don't.
B008BP097A|3.0|Music is fine but given that online purchases are only available in a lossy format, it seems like a low blow to ALSO be missing the hidden track... more compromises than quality for choosing the cheaper purchase.
B005PK56TA|4.0|Great show. Weird stories but very interesting characters. Definitely not your typical Amytiville type story. Most episodes were exciting and horrific, some were sad as well. This show is addictive. Kept me coming back for more.
0061438294|5.0|First off, I'm aiming for a biopsychology major and have been interested and reading up/researching about things related to psychology/neuroscience/philosophy/logic/etc. since freshman year in high school. So the 5 stars come from someone who plans to use the ideas from these fields for the rest of his life.<br /><br />+Unabashedly straightforward prose makes this book very accessible<br />+Ergonomic layout: pages are spacious enough to be comfy, pictures and anecdotes are interspersed throughout. The book feels very friendly to the eye!<br />+Insistence upon actually using real scientific evidence instead of giving you total BS: avoids petty mythology (like this action = lying) and actually first introduces the limbic system and its connection to automatic behaviors.<br /><br />-Not very many but... I've seen some of Navarro's posts on PsychologyToday, and he didn't talk about skin in this book (he had a post on it on PT). He also didn't go into things like voice frequencies (inflection) or proxemics, but hey, it's still a great book.
B005HP2JAM|5.0|It's not often that you see a documentary that was really meant to be shot in 3D and experienced in 3D. Cave of Forgotten Dreams is one such film. The scope and depth of the interior of the Chauvet Cave is absolutely incredible, and this film captures it in a majestic and magical way. The post script at the end of the film adds an even more surreal touch to the story, and expresses the oddly whimsical character that I have come to know and love from the film's director, Werner Herzog. Don't miss it!
B007EDCWHA|5.0|I loved this book<br />It was great to learn even more about the boys and their life and what their favorite things are
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie.  Gald I did.  Was not disipointed in the movie either.  I laughed many times through the book and felt the tension, and frustration the families of the characters were experiencing as a result of having a family member with a mental illness.  I loved this book.  I read it in 24 hours and then started to read it again after I saw the movie.  Great story.  Highly recommend it.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Pretty sweet game where you get to be a shark and stuff.  Hope  that was helpful Einstein. These shark are belong to us.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|I love the character development.  The acting is outstanding.  What great writers this show has!  Can't get enough of Downton!
B00CATSONE|4.0|I was inspired and encouraged by the story of TESLA.<br />This was a easy read that you do not put down til the last word.<br />TESLA stayed true to himself and his inventions and discoveries even though many great powerful men<br />Used him for their own financial ends.<br />Hope I can tap more into my own imagination .
B002ZG99CC|4.0|This kid is amazing. This is such a great story of the indomitable human spirit. Put your mind to anything and great things can happen.
B00BDAP66E|3.0|It's okay as I indicated, and I would love if we didn't have to write a review...just rate with a star.  Because I don't like to 'talk'.  It only shows for my 'page' the comments, etc...not for ALL of Facebook! as I thought it did.  Is this enough of a review?  Probably will remove from my Kindle.
B00003CWNR|4.0|this movie is beautifully acted by everyone but the topic of abortion is tough. Caines character makes good points about girls being butchered cuz they find themselves in situations they cant handle. However, I believe every life is precious and is a gift from God. At 20, I found myself pregnant by a man that dumped me. Its a scary place to be, but abortion is not the way to go. Someone wants that child!
B008X8RSTM|5.0|the ability to have maps that are precise and not have to keep internet connected is worth the small price.
0062082353|5.0|Clearly written an easy and exciting read. Chris Kyle has a great way of blending the components of this book to not only show what our Seals are asked to do. But how difficult is is to accomplish. A great tribute to our Seals.
B007BT0RKG|5.0|Clear and precise maps and the ability to load them in and use them without the internet connection is well worth it.
B005BGBPBG|1.0|Wow. Where do I begin? The plot was a repeat of three scenes rotated over and over again. The movie was about lying... how to keep lying... and how lying in the end lands you with the guy. John Krasinski, who plays \\"Ethan\\" the best friend, was the only redeeming character. Refreshingly funny despite a severely awkward script. I do not recommend wasting your brain cells on this guilt/shame train.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|This keeps your attention, even with the over-techinical descriptions of physics and space solution solving. To those who want to be entertained without having technical information, it is still a treat.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|maybe a little small for what I expected but the rest is as I imagined it, and is a product that has good references
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This story has its ups and downs, showing us how we touch each other's lives without even planning to do so!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This game is great because it can be as fast or as long as you choose. It is fun to try to figure out exactly how to achieve results in the most efficient way. I recommend it.
0152164154|5.0|I recently gave this to my granddaughter.  She is studying French, and immediately started reading this.  She really likes likes the book, and it makes this old grampa happy to see it!  It is a beautiful book, and also especially significant when you look into the story of the author, and his place in the historic happenings back in those days.
B003V9OCS8|5.0|I'm not much for subtitles, but this movie was very well done.  You really feel like those guys are up on that mountain.  Great acting.  Great story.  Great scenery.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Completely captivates even though it isn't usually my type of topic. My tastes run to Games of Thrones and Vikings, but this is a great slice of history with fully rounded characters. Great show!
B0041D843M|5.0|You have it in your own hands. I take care what I put into my body. After reading this important book, I know that I'm right!<br />It's a must read!
B00820N2JG|3.0|Concept funny enough but excessive puppet on puppet sexual encounters/innuendos got boring fast.  Beavis & Buthead were much better in the long run.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|...I was hoping for something redemptive from the last of the trilogy .  I could not get past the whole man['s inhumanity to man  ... an idea of a society being reduced to such levels of greed, control, and the ultimate devastating loss (which if we admit it, is not far from reality).  Having to be threatened with the possibility of your child having to fight to the death for his/her life deeply troubled me.  My generation has lived through wars, assassinations, and senseless en masse violence.  While well-written and imaginative (it was as if this book was written from the perspective of someone well-experienced in violent video games...), the idea that we as a people, even in this country, could eventually realize such a state is grievous.  I wish I hadn't read it...
B00BWU0S3Q|4.0|Great movie full of action, good acting and not a lot sex or nudity. I think Josh Brolin  stepped up his acting skills. Ryan Gosling, Emma stone and Michael Peña were great as usual.
B00009YOQW|5.0|This drum is on the smaller side but is a great buy.  I have friends who have gone through several plastic drums because their toddler boys are very rough on toys.  This drum is solid wood, so it's pretty much indestructible.  The drum comes with a rubber-headed mallet that makes a really nice, pleasing tone - not something that will drive parents crazy to listen to for hours at a time.  My 2-yr-old boy loves it, and another little girl his age loved playing with this drum so much that she tried to take it home with her.
B00CATSONE|4.0|This was a great free book, although a short one. I should warn, however, that the first part does not talk about Tesla, but rather the nature of greatness. This rather long prologue of sorts was not boring by any means, many interesting historical anecdotes were given on a variety of famous people. If you are only interested in reading about Tesla, however, you will need to skip nearly a third of the book. That being said, I enjoyed both parts thoroughly. Tesla has long been a hero of mine, a greatly misunderstood genius, constantly done in by unscrupulous men and his own sense of generosity and fair play. I've often wondered if Tesla had had a ruthless but devoted manager to keep the wolves at bay, how many more brilliant theories and inventions would he have created? Sadly, the world will never know, we must just be grateful for what he did accomplish.
B006YC74E8|4.0|I havnt tried it yet, but by reading a lot of the feedbacks previously left I am hoping it will help me edit photos better.  I am hoping this will help me edit photos that I place onto facebook and other places for my arts I sell.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|This game is awesome! Highly recommend it if you are looking for a MOBA like League of Legends! Great gameplay and tons of great players.
B008EKMB82|4.0|Alexander Pope said &#34;Man is born to rise and fall, a potential for greatness,and likewise, disaster,&#34; Well, in my opinion, Ozeki's story was filled with all kinds of potential for greatness. At times I thought the book was absolutely brilliant.  But  I literally had to force myself to read the last twenty pages or so. Something went very wrong in my estimation. A Tale is not an easy read. If you're looking for a 'beach book' this isn't it.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|My wife and I love the show. It is full of action something tragic is always happening there are all kinds of twists and turns in the story line.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It's adequate.  I just use it for quick visits and was pleased with it.  until yesterday.  now my news feed is loaded with suggestions for me.  can't make them go away.  I don't know how much regular Facebook changes have to do with the apps, but I won't use it again until this is fixed.  my news feed contains nothing buy suggested pages.  can't see a thing from my friends.
B0060FXDCG|5.0|Great product. It was exactly what I ordered and works better than expected. I use it all the time and it is still in great shape. Best movies in a long time. I watch these religiously since I do not own cable.
B00BMKDTNC|2.0|This finale would be good if it was the end  of a trilogy, but given that this is the culmination of about 20 years of work and about a million books this is a big let down. The much feared bad guys were all weak, there were very few one on one intense battle scenes, and ironically after dragging out the story for so long the ending was rushed and made little sense. The best thing about this book is that the series is actually finished.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I really loved this game. The story and puzzles were both great. I thought the game length was perfect. My only complaint is there isn't a sequel yet!
B0063M22QO|4.0|Great design. Tiles are attractive and large enough for me to see easily. Game is straightforward and fun to play.  Keeps me entertained.
1936608898|5.0|This book has enlightened me. I lost 94 lbs about 3 years ago but never could lose the last 10 lbs. then when I started running and weight lifting I gained about 5 lbs in muscle. I still fought my weight every day. Couldn't understand why I could run 10-13 miles 3 times a week, lift weights 3 times a week and ride bikes 30 miles on Saturday and still fight my weight. Little did I know that the oatmeal and cream in my coffee would be causing my cravings. I haven't been doing the whole30 but a week and a half and I can already tell the difference in my cloths. Im nit having any cravings now at all. Thanks so much for a book that explains how food reacts in the body in a language we can understand. Wanda Shoemake

B001ANSSDC|5.0|Finally a real story that isn't all rainbows and butterflies. A story with grief, sadness, & truth about how life truly is. It really makes you think of your own life and what is the silver lining, however small. Great read! One of my favorite books thus far!

B0083GQ2A0|4.0|A hard core story thats real but simple , survival .  Leaving most people behind . Spectacular scenery and on the<br />edge of your seat drama with unexpected action . It is rather a slow mover at times , but not bad  . Once you start this<br />story you don't want get up and miss a scene or you'll miss the plot . If you liked Taken and Taken 2 , this is a movie<br />you should watch . Not for everyone is the reason for a four star rating  : )
B008476HBM|4.0|This book is simply timeless. No matter the number of times you read it; you fall deeper in love with story!

042524489X|5.0|I have read all the books in the series in order and I have to say that I have been waiting to read this one ever since I finished the first one. And I wasn't disappointed at all. At first I thought that the author wouldn't be able to balance out the romance with the upcoming battle but she was able to do that and more. I can't wait to read the next book and see what develops.
B004RC8NUQ|5.0|Good movie! I love Ashton Kutcher so much! :p Great movie to watch. I need to have 3 more words yay I'm finished :p
B005LAIIKI|1.0|just watch movie on 27 Apr, the movie arrive on time, but there is something wrong with the disc, it is jumping all over the place, this was my first time watching this movie, i feel like i just received a defective disc.<br /><br />Deidre Perry

B0034DGPEU|5.0|The story is riveting.  I have never read this particular author before, but she has a talent for drawing you into the characters.  It would appear that she had done a lot of research into this time period in history prior to writing the book.  Her character development is wonderful.  The plot suspenseful--I can only put the book down when I am too sleepy to read any further.  I wish all books were this good.
B0094FTKIA|2.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />'Magic Mike' refers to the protagonist of the film, Mike Lane, played by Channing Tatum. Mike is a budding entrepreneur in Tampa, Florida, who is a both a partner and performer in a male strip club, run by its over the top owner, Dallas (Matthew McConaughey). Mike has aspirations to start legitimate businesses, including a custom furniture venture, but must work in the strictly cash male strip club world, in order to fund his other enterprises.<br /><br />Mike takes nineteen-year-old Adam under his wing who's just lost his construction job. Mike falls for Adam's medical assistant sister, Brooke, who looks at his involvement in male stripping with disdain. The film's sub-plot involves Mike's inner struggle to leave his sleazy lifestyle and court Brooke, who represents everything good, wholesome and clean.<br /><br />The main plot of the film involves Adam's fall from grace as he becomes seduced by drug dealers who peddle ecstasy. Adam and Mike perform at a private sorority party and are attacked by the sorority girls' boyfriends, who discover that Adam has been giving ecstasy to some of the girls. During this altercation, Adam leaves a bag worth $10,000 of ecstasy pills at the party and later Mike must pay off drug dealers who are now looking to get even with Adam.<br /><br />At film's end, Adam opts to move to Miami with Dallas who has opened up a bigger and better club. Mike finally has an epiphany that he'll never be able to realize his dreams as a legitimate business owner if he remains in the male strip club world and leaves Dallas and that world for Brooke, who is grateful that Mike bailed out her brother.<br /><br />If you're into male stripping (which I am not), this might be your cup of tea. There are plenty of scenes featuring the male strippers performing in various costumes, suggesting different venues. The female audience at the club seem to get off on the acts of simulated sex, but I suspect that most men watching this stuff will find it a big bore.<br /><br />One of the other problems with the story is that the Brooke character is pretty much one-dimensional. In addition to her devotion to her brother, she represents the wholesome world which Mike aspires to be part of. Hence, Cody Horn as Brooke, has little to do except wait for Mike as he finally transforms himself at the film's climax.<br /><br />Director Steven Soderbergh appears to be ambivalent about the male stripping world he's commenting on. On one hand, he recognizes that such a world is sleazy due to its many connections to the criminal element. For example, Adam's fall from grace is a direct result of his association with such elements. On the other hand, Soderbergh appears to revel in the actual performances of these male strippers (as evidenced by the amount of performance scenes he opts to include in his film).<br /><br />In the end, I wonder if exploring the male strip club world is worthy of a feature length film. Perhaps a documentary might have been more effective. Soderbergh's rather simplistic tale of redemption cannot offset the vacuousness of the world he has chosen to explore.men watching this stuff will find it a big bore.<br /><br />One of the other problems with the story is that the Brooke character is pretty much one-dimensional.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book, not only because it was a great love story; but also because it involved the development of a relationship between the lead character and the widower's children.  Also loved the fact that the widowed father adored his children; and he showed how much love and respect that he had for them.  He didn't just fall in love with someone without strongly considering the needs of his children.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.  It soundly measures up to Nicholas Sparks' other books in how he deals with loving relationships.
B00683JLXA|1.0|I couldn't get this game past the first level.  You cant get any velocity on the rock and the angling is funky. Kindle Fire Hd...gets a delete which is sad because it looks like it could be a nice game.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|love the game. just wish there was other ways to obtain heart gems. my four year old is a little young to be using the Internet... please fill free to add us as friends.... our game wont let us invite friends but it will let go to the screen where I can send my friends gifts... thanks
1433502410|4.0|Wonderful study bible. I just wish the whole thing was spiral bound. It would make it huge, but it is already huge. Totally worth the price.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I watched this series and couldn't get enough! I stayed up way too late most of the time because I couldn't turn it off which made work pretty miserable but worth it. when it comes to these kind of shows I have no self control....
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|This series sneaked up on me and now I am hooked.  Up to now the only viking film I recall was the Kirk Douglas/Tony Curtis pic from many years ago.  I loved it as a youngster, but see its many flaws when watching today.  This series is much more fulfilling and offers a glimpse into the Nordic world of Eric the Red and others.  There is limited written viking history and the series relies greatly on oral history and Christian historical mentions.  Surely, the real vikings were not nice people and pretty much savages by our standards today.  In that context the characters are well drawn and are offered by those you cheer for and those you are glad to see enjoying a burning water craft funeral.  Vikings is pure entertainment I enjoy alongside Game of Thrones.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I watched the first season and couldn't wait to start the second! It was just as good as the first. As soon as I can afford the third it will be mine too. Can't wait! The make-up they put on the actors was unbeleiveably terrific, the special effects were amazing, and the story line was better than any other zombie flick I've ever watched. Hope this series goesn forever...but it won't because I love it, that's the way it always seems to go anyway.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Well written, in a very down to earth, and understandable way.  Would recommend this book to anyone interested in military actions.
B00CDT41RY|3.0|In the long side. I'm glad we saw it at home.  It was interesting to see the point of view how slavery affected a \\"free\\" black man in that era.  Of course the bloody graphics had to be over the top.  We just shook our heads at some of the gratuitous scenes...
B008AK8FHM|5.0|There are many accounts of NDE's, but this may be the most &#34;scientific&#34; one, and for many that means most believable.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This game is awesome!!!!!  Best slender game ever!!!!!<br />One time I was playing then slender man came out of nowhere!!!!!!
B00003A9QI|5.0|I am a writer and use soundtracks for inspiration. The theme threaded throughout this soundtrack is beautiful. This is great for a sort of bittersweet atmosphere with poignant swells.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It is  a good book and a funny book it made me laugh a lot! really  good book!it really rock's.LOL!
B00BF11STU|2.0|This movie did not hold my interest.  I had to finish it the second day because I fell asleep watching it when I initially rented the movie
1433502410|5.0|All I can say is wow!!  A buddy at work recomended it to me..It is the most complete bible study I have ever seen
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|adults and kids do not get this at all because crazy people can do nasty drawing on it so do not get it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007ZXK08C|5.0|I love Gillian's writing.  This book keeps you on the edge.  She certainly has done her research on Borderline Personalities, and writes with great insight.  I am now reading her other books.  Wonderful  writer.
B00BI5IXL4|4.0|The movie is good. I really don't like musicals, but I like this one. It has some strange parts and I thin the actors and acrtresses did really well. Would I buy this again? Nah ... but I would rent it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I felt cheated because the 'look inside' portrays an interesting, intriguing story, but then about 10 pages into it, it goes all weird.  I fussed till I got it off my phone in case I died and somebody found it! ha  Really disappointing that such garbage could be the huge bestseller that it was!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Loads of fun. Nice game. My daughter and I both like it. All the different animals are funny. The story line sticks with the movies too.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|This is one way out show.  Where did they get the idea of a police box?  It does fill some dead time.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|I love all 3 movies. Much cheaper on here than in store. Great picture quality. Saw all 3 in theaters. Very happy to own them
B005DJREGQ|3.0|This program can be weird at time.  Not my favorite or even in the good range.  I would not pay for it.
B00AEFYNTU|4.0|Rachel McAdams portrays her part with an innocent, enthusiasm which comes with youth. Diane Keaton and Harrison Ford provide the jaded, frustrated side. Both do it well. All the acting was good. It was amusing in parts. If you are looking for something light and entertaining, this would be it.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Proof of Heaven is a must read! If only everyone could understand and show the love we are meant to share, this world would be more like heaven. At times this book can be a bit technical but it is written by a neurosurgeon and it all goes to prove his experience was \\"real\\", as you will understand when you read it.
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|Definitely for the Middle-aged women viewers-something for every woman to relate to in it. Had some funny parts but wouldn't give it a 2nd go around.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Everyone should see this movie!  Both characters are inspiring.  It is definitely a feel good movie.  I loved that it is a true story.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|This is reminiscent of &#34;24&#34; as I couldn't wait to see what Jack Bauer would do in the next episode and I can hardly wait to see the next episode of &#34;The Following&#34;.  Kevin Bacon rocks!!!!!!!!!  Good job to the creator Kevin Williamson.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|This author must secretly hate women.  Her main characters are twisted female leads.  That said her books are always gripping and interesting!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|It is a great interpretation of this classic. The live singing reminds me of watching it on the stage. Also, it was good Samantha Barks reprised her role as Eponine.
B0068RQ85K|5.0|I've just recently received this item and I haven't had the opportunity to use it yet. What I like about it so far is that it has an easy set up and can be anchored to my workbench and the instructions on the back of the box seem very easy to follow. I believe I will be very pleased with this item and would recommend it to others.
B0055QYKQO|5.0|Motherboard setup is easy, bios functions both as legacy and UEFI so supporting older or newer operating systems is very easy. The included software worked flawlessly for me. I was able to tweak fan speeds for adequate cooling without being too loud, setup a mild overclock, update my bios and setup some power saving features in just a few minutes. I especially like the feature that allows you to have the computer automatically sleep when it detects your bluetooth enabled cell phone has left the area.<br /><br />My only complaints are limited to the fan plugs. I really expected a few more fan plugs for a board with 'gamer' or 'performance' feature set. It has 3, plus a single 4 pin for the CPU fan, but I would have rather seen 6 or more.
B0064MGU98|4.0|Great writing, good story lines, good drama, good acting. Julianna Margulies, Archie Punjabi, Chris Noth are perfect in the roles.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Movie was more about passage of the 13th amendment than Lincoln.  Sad to see politics has always been deal making.
B005MLOOJA|4.0|Great writing, good story lines, good drama, good acting. Julianna Margulies, Archie Punjabi, Chris Noth are perfect in the roles.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|wanted to read this 5th part to get the full picture of the story.<br />the reading has been extended by the in-between 4th part.<br />I recommend it to any fan, but I understand that some readers give up after the too long story that seems to go nowhere.<br />What happened to some of the POV characters that poped-up in the 4th volume?<br /><br />anyway, I still find it a tremendous peace of writing and like it to recommend
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I actually wanna go to my own park cause this app makes it feel so real and I also think that this game is fun
B00683JLXA|3.0|Couldnt get it to throw on my galaxy tab2 10.1 until I figured out that the touch point was above the balled up pandas (on the big pandas head). Its ok for free, but why would I buy it vs angry birds?
0385349947|4.0|This book gives a good insight into a womans mindset. Most part is true, i would agree. There was useful information as to how men can contribute towards womens success. I learnt to be assertive, be frank in telling out what i think, ask what we need etc. I felt every women i  know who crossed my life needs to read this.
B007ZSBQYE|4.0|App seems to work fine. Yes controls are odd, but were on a tablet and not in real life.<br />Hey, its only a 50 cent app.<br />Good for kids to play on. Controls are simple and not much instruction is needed to begin.
B001UGB1X8|5.0|Saw this movie advertised.  Being handicapped, TV is a major advantage but there are times when with so many channels, nothing interesting appears on the line-up.  I spotted this movie...it looked like it had potential so I decided that since the price was right it was worth giving a try.  My roommate and I were blown away.  This movie was above and beyond anything we could have imagined.  It was so good that we opted to mpurchase a copy so thar we could view it later and share it with friends.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is such a good series and the era, costumes and setting are so fitting for each other.  Of course the actors and actresses are the perfect combination.  This is an exciting show without the bad language...so refreshing.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|jetpack joyride it awesome to everyone who hasen't heard of it before. if you have the sound down it very peaceful. And if you beat the game don't feel like &quot;aaaawww man now I have nothing to do on it.&quot; But NO. it keeps giving u more missions to do. I myself have been waiting for it on my kindle fire and I am so happy
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Thrilling, unique, and interesting.  I like it.  Watched because I was bored, now I'm hooked.  I love that its free.
B00BF123WG|5.0|I had my doubts about it because I don't usually like very graphic movies. But it is worth watching! Enjoy!!
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Reason I did not &#34;Love it&#34; was because &#34;The Hero&#34; died, so to speak. I like my shows to end on a up note!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton season 3 will have you on edge til the very end! Surprises around every corner. Thomas will surprise you!
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Always like Clint. The script was pretty good and the actors worked great. Nicely filmed and did not get boring.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is a story with characters that are so well drawn that they stay with one long, long after the last page.  The two main characters are written in a manner that elicits clear understanding of their motives and actions.  Will is portrayed not as a pathetic invalid but, rather a person of strong beliefs and purpose that go way beyond his physical limitations.  His attitudes are clearly understood and elicit both empathy and sympathy.  The love that develops between these two is genuine and fully relatable.  I've been recommending this book to everyone.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|I will admit that I did not expect this movie to be as good as it was. Matthew McConaughey played an impressive, slick, street smart attorney who truly believed that everyone deserved legal representation. To him, the scariest thing to have was an innocent client because if the client went to jail he could not deal with the guilt. He preferred the guilty client because he could then justify his tactics and definitely not feel guilty if the client got time.<br /><br />The Lincoln Lawyer was a nice little escape. I would not pay to see it in the movies, but I would pay to rent (thank goodness it's included with prime).
0385536828|3.0|I'm not sure if there is such a thing as `subtle espionage' but it seems to be what McEwan was going for with this book.<br /><br />The end left me deflated. There was no defining closure. I thought maybe even one more page could have allowed a satisfying ending. Then for some reason I flipped back to page 1 & found in the first paragraph how cleverly McEwan had given us the ending we would all be looking for at the very beginning, had we only known.<br /><br />I found the premise of the `Sweet Tooth' mission silly, but then I'm not up on how MI5 works. Serena is not the most likable of characters. For a pretty, well educated, well read girl from a good family she is very naïve & gullible. She appears as pliable putty falling `in love' with every man that crosses her path. Also the books within the book was a bit tedious. For these reasons the story kind of plodded along, but I couldn't stop reading because of the way McEwan writes. Its conversational prose written in the first person, narrated by Serena, kind of pulls you in & you can't stop.<br /><br />*Of special interest to me was the way Tom explains to Serena how to `feel' poetry rather than just read the words. (Pg.178). Exceptionally touching & beautifully expressed. It made me want to read some poetry.*<br /><br />McEwan is a skillful master of words making for me an otherwise absurd story with an unlikable heroine quite readable.
034580404X|2.0|Lousy book.  Suitable for juveniles wanting to learn about unusual sex.  Not recommended.  Not recommended for anyone.  Serously, not recommended.  And if I keep getting notes saying I need to add more words you will get NO MORE REVIEWS OF ANYTHING!!!
B00119ZMKW|5.0|Good to see them mix it up a bit.  Lots of earth based scenarios.  Interesting but the stargate travel is why we watch.
B0082XJGRK|4.0|for studying the Romans.  I have only read a small portion.  College classes and full time employment put a hamper on my extra reading.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I would recommend Lean In to all women whether they are pursuing a career, family, or both. I really enjoyed it!
B007ZSBQYE|1.0|This is one more game made with a console mentality and an attempted port to a tablet interface. It will be a great day when designers realize that a lousy simulated controller is a stupid idea.  That day isn't here yet.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Oh what a wonderful read, I am still smiling! Thanks to Mary Eileen for recommending this book and then giving me her ARC. I just loved Park and I grew to understand and love Eleanor. Eleanor is big, awkward with bad clothes and bright red hair. She is the oldest of a very large family. Her mother makes bad choices with men and her latest stepdad is a drunk who beats his wife and when Eleanor expressed her hatred of him, her mother sent Eleanor away for a year to live with her brother and his wife. Now Eleanor and her brothers and sisters all sleep in one bedroom; there is no door on the bathroom and Eleanor doesn’t even own a toothbrush. Park comes from a family that is the opposite of Eleanor’s; always enough food, and love and support. It is Park and Eleanor who slowly, but surely find one another first through comic books, then music, then conversation. None of their relationship and then their romance is easy, but they find each other and hold on. I didn’t want to put this book down; I loved both of their voices and I especially loved how Park protected and fought for Eleanor and how he saved her through his actions and words. I want to read this book over again and again and I don’t ever say that.
B006X8GFBQ|4.0|This is a very good book, slow to start, but very rewarding. And a strong change of outlook and atmosphere compared with other Alastair Reynolds' books.<br /><br />If you are looking for a maladjusted, dystopic space opera with a motley crew of trans/post-human misfits a la Revelation Space, you'd be initially surprised or disappointed. I know I was.<br /><br />But if you keep reading, this book will grow on you, and you'll very likely end up devouring page after page non-stop.<br /><br />This is before anything else a very human, familiar (as in family-related) down to Earth book, despite of happening in a future where people and animals have neuroimplants on their brains, many places in the Solar System have been colonized and space robots roam everywhere up to the Kuiper Belt, feeding the economy of a now rich, shiny, smiling and apparently happy Earth. With members of a rich African family as its protagonists, all descendants from an elderly matriarch, pivotal to that Earth's future story. Something I liked, it's the tangentially stated fact that Africa is supposed to be a super-power by then, which is never really forced upon you. And as I said, I like that. The race of the protagonists is never used for making any point whatsoever, except that they are rich, conflicted by family issues and still human regardless of the many changes in that world and its people; because in that future, racism, homophobia and war are simply forgotten follies of times past, like they deserve to be. But humans are still human, and strife, power lust and betrayal still happen.<br /><br />This book is also deceptively bland in the surface, because it is in some sense, a morally ambiguous utopia. A near-dystopia of forced non-aggression, where everyone's actions are monitored and sometimes controlled by The Mechanism (a network of AIs watching over all data sources, including those in people's eyes and brains), and where somewhat strong words are allowed and said, but direct aggression is strictly forbidden in a rather ugly way. Presenting something that could actually happen in some foreseeable future, and that will remind some people of some aspects of Stanislaw Lem's \\"Return from the Stars\\".<br /><br />It is clear the characters have strong emotions going below the forced non-aggression, and it is kind of a feat that Alastair Reynolds manages to make these somewhat bounded/gagged characters so emotionally appealing. Or rather, the ways they find to wrestle out of the oppressive control they live 24/24.<br /><br />It's in fact the dense tapestry of family related conflicts, emotions and finally, love, which makes up for the garish concepts of The Mechanism and the Surveyed Space, lurking behind the pretty facade of this deceptively nice and prosperous future. Which works also as a social commentary on where some things are going even now. This book's version of the future feels both alive and plausible.<br /><br />Oddly enough, I can imagine this book as a prequel for Revelation Space books, but I know it isn't.<br /><br />All in all, a book worthy of your time.

B008Y79IUE|4.0|The movie does a great job at showing how a few decisions separate failure from success in a risky business that was compounded with many other factors that young adults face. The movie was well cast and helped make the movie believable.  Poor insight regarding cohesion of quick success was greatly compounded throughout the movie.  The movie has a similar tie to the movie Pi, by the same director, regarding how the use of substances add unexpected circumstances in regards to the outcome of the movie. It was a great watch. Kept me glued to my seat, but it made me wish there was a delete button on my memory and others the movie was viewed with were in agreeance.  Sometimes circumstances we work hard to avoid are better without the visual interpretation.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|Gripping. Emotional. Very good! This is a shocking, and emotional roller coaster. I felt like I was in the tsunami even at home on my big screen. Acting-superb. Story-superb. Special fxs- superb.

B009R659L8|5.0|Another great mystery bringing seemingly unrelated cases all together in the end. Mary Higgins Clark is a genius. Loved it.

0385349947|2.0|This book is the equivalent of a Disney story on a Master's level. The statistics were hand chosen to support her ideal, you can not remove the fact that she<br />was hand delivered into college with opportunities to meet political figures at an early age. Women with these degrees and financially priveledged backgrounds, simply have a choice. They have no debt to pay, they are not single parents, they do not need to support ill-family members.  You are talking about 5-10% of the country.  These factors are part of what makes one's decision to choose a career path.  By failing to mention and acknowledge how difficult the choice can be based on financial factors and not just based on wanting to be home with your children, she invalidates the book for a huge percentage of people.<br /><br />It is not very relevant to the country at large who is in an economical crisis. Lean In puts fairy tales in young woman's heads, drives them toward basing their self-esteem on hitting a benchmark instead of looking at what's in their heart for happiness.  Peace of mind, true acceptance of oneself in light of one's strengths and foibles is what makes one happy for a life time.  When women \\"lean in\\" and base their self-worth primarily on acquiring a status-oriented , high -paying job, they will inevitably experience severe disappointment, and a sense of failure if they don't get the job or are fired.<br /><br />I still believe that people who are spiritually and mentally healthy, and have spent time being introspective can choose their career path and passion wisely.  Messages like Sandberg's especially when given to young women have the same affect as Walt Disney had on us when we were little.  We believed all we had to do was run away from our Mother/Step-Mother, sing in the woods, clean up a cottage, the animals would come and help, and eventually we would be rescued by our Prince.  Sandberg's fantasy is that no matter who you are, if you \\"fight\\" to the top of any field that will make you happy.  She promotes that it is women's responsibility to \\"make the world better\\" by Leaning In, her definition.  What about the the patients I see who are trying to hit these goals, but have such anxiety that they have severe migraines,  irritable bowels, can't sleep, can't eat, and thyroiditis.  Not everyone is equipped to handle the stress, and Sandberg's owes it to address that side of the world.<br /><br />It's a slightly subliminal message but it's there.  By all means after \\"cleaning out one's emotional cellar,\\" honestly assessing your strengths and weaknesses, really thinking about your passion, if one wants to pursue the world of business then they should.  And I'm a huge believer of follow your dreams and goals with everything you've got.  I'm also a believer in follwoing your own dreams which will change on your journey.  Too many young women feel that they are valued by their parents, friends and society only when they produce and achieve educational/physical goals.  This is the source of the extreme teenage angst I see in my practice.  This angst and fear of never being enough or having to please their parents by following the parents dream, is what ha lead to increased substance abuse in teens, depression, cutting, suicide, and acts of violence.<br /><br />Where would our world be if so many woman wanted to pursue business and head companies with the pure motivation of making that company wealthier.  There are nature and nurture differences in people, but certainly some is based on physiologic differences.  Not every man (or woman) can be a good parent.  So to simplify the case into men and women should each hold 50% of all roles is detrimental.  What would our society do without the healers, nurses, physicians, teachers, where a significantly higher portion of those services are females. Where would our world be if those people were not willing to accept that they are grossly underpaid and while they may financially struggle, they feel they are contributing to making the world a better place.  These amazing people in public service are content and satisfied with their lives, because every day they make a difference in the world.<br /><br />What if they had pursued a \\"business\\" path because they were lured by the concept of wealth tied to happiness?  What would happen if seeing all these published salaries of \\"heads of business,\\" they decided that they wanted that lifestyle, and they all pursued business degrees.  Our children, our society would suffer, the likes of which Ms. Sandberg could not even imagine.<br /><br />When you make acquiring wealth your primary career motivation you almost always will be empty at some point in your life.  This given with the exception of the wealthy people like Bill gates, and Steve Jobs who use their wealth to make a difference in the world.  I find it quite surprising and disheartening that Sandberg doesn't relay the message that aquiring this wealth gives one the opportunity to make changes in lives of people less fortunate.  It is in giving with a compassionate and empathetic heart where true life happiness is found.<br /><br /> If she had discussed any of this in her talks (I missed it, but I haven;t watched all of them) about how her huge success is enabling her to make the world a better place by funding foundations, etc, then I would respect her message more.  There is too much focus on adversity in our world, and less focus on becoming a part of the community, and helping.<br /><br />She also paints a very one-sided picture and fails to mention facts that don't support her theory.  In the defense-contract world (a multi-billion dollar business), preferential awarding of contracts is based on having a woman president of the company. I find her research to be selective and self-serving. I find the name dropping discredits the book, as it provides further false allure to those who equate fame and fortune with happiness.  s does so many other things.<br /><br /> Lastly having worked with people (men and woman) in these \\"Top-level\\" high stress jobs who tend to feel they need to hide any evidence of imperfection in their lives such as marital discord and unhappy and stressed children, the stress of having to maintain this image leads to much higher rates of heart disease and cancer.  Has Sandberg ever considered that the woman who choose not to follow her chosen path simply are smart about their life choices?  They are following their heart and their passion, instead of their need to keep raising the bar on their accomplishments to feel like they are worthy.  All in all, I have empathy for where she is life and her future, because I think the stress she has fostered to help her self-esteem will ultimately affect her after years, and I hope she is developing some peace of mind via meditation, etc. She needs to read the books Perfectly yourself by Matthew Kelly, The Untethered Soul, and Will I ever be enough, and that may be helpful to her to see the bigger picture.
B00BUCXVPI|4.0|We have read all the Jack Reacher books and were surprised when Cruise was cast as Jack as our vision of him was quite different. But we both agree that Cruise pulled it off.  Very entertaining.

1452115567|5.0|Wonderful, the relationship between a man and his dog. Delightful photos. Beautiful words. It brought a smile to my face. Well done, sir. Thanks for sharing your story with us.
B004742Y68|5.0|This movie has always been one of my favorites. Spielberg doesn't make them like this anymore. For the time 1982 the special effect , I think, still hold up well.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|EL James brings the characters to life with her writing. You feel their fear, self loathing, love and heart each. A must read by all
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I wish there were more shows like this rather than all the stupid reality programs that are on tv.  Characters were well writing.
0446554995|3.0|I'm giving TWO GRAVES 3 stars, as much as I hate to. I do love the Agent Pendergast series, and as far as I'm concerned, the dynamic duo of Preston and Child can't write fast enough. However, in this book the plot and subplots are fanciful and all over the place. I felt the ending fell short, even though the door remains wide open for the next book. And, trust me, I will read the next one. There were some interesting additions to the character pool in Two Graves, some likeable, some not so, some simply too hard to believe.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I hate having to wait till October each year for the new season to come out.  Just upset that the governer made it to another season!

B001QJUX24|4.0|Great movie.  I love John Wayne and Natalie Woods.  The places when they shoot the movie was beautiful.  I recommend the movie to anyone.
B0074AGVWK|4.0|I loved this story because it 'rang many bells' for me! It is all about the kids who have left the 'nest' briefly but find the 'outside' world too hard to cope with and have decided life is much easier back at home where Mum and Dad will continue to support and take care of them! But Mum and Dad realise they can not afford to continue to provide for their 'chickens' and they need to be encouraged to leave the nest and learn to take care of themselves! It is told in Maeve Binchy's delightful 'easy read' style; lots of humour and wit - definitely a 'must read'!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Another beautiful book to add to the series! Though it was sad mostly, and have me many restless nights. Lol. But this series is truly amazing and i CANNOT  wait to get started on the next book. But because it is nearly 4am i will pick it up tomorrow. Lol
B007TK77QE|3.0|I have read all of the Harry Potter series and I loved them. They were very well written and crafted, drew the reader into the story and were difficult to put down. &#34;The Casual Vacancy&#34; was also well crafted by J K Rowling but the writing was too organised! It did not 'ring true' at times and therefore did not 'grab' me! I finished reading the book but I felt the writing did not reflect the spontaneity of that in J K Rowling's previous books.
B00BF123WG|3.0|Ok movie. Nothing ground breaking or earth shattering especially if you have read any of the books available on the subject.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|This is a really good book.<br /><br />Basically the book looks at different people and cultures and considers what it takes to be successful. Some critics have suggested that the book is merely anecdotal generalizing from hockey players and Asians, but it is much more than that and I'm inclined to think that those who suggest that didn't really read the book or that they skimmed it. The book, in fact, does quite a bit of research on what makes people successful.<br /><br />At the risk of oversimplifying things I will note that Gladwell has two, maybe three basic tenants. First, it takes a lot of hard work to get good at something. It takes at least ten thousand hours. That is, for example, how much time Bill Gates took to master computer programming. Second, it takes someone or some fortuitous event (and/or mentor/guardian/parent) to help make huge success. Third culture, in a sense, can be a big player in success. Your culture may lend itself to seeing numbers and math in a way others don't. But, perhaps more importantly you have to come from a culture or family that will sacrifice to make you succeed.<br /><br />Yes, I know this sounds a bit Horatio Algerish, but the book is much more than that. Gladwell is a superb writer, more importantly he steps us through the process of how people have achieved success and the help that they got. A lot of this ought to be obvious, but sadly, it's not. Read this book and think about what Gladwell says. I'm glad I did.<br /><br />PS ... almost at the end of the book he has some very interesting things to say about education, primary school education. He says a lot in a very short space. He's right and the sad thing is I'm not sure we can achieve the type of education he suggests is necessary. In a nutshell, if we want to do better in this area we need to have many more days in the classroom in a structured, yet student centered environment. This probably won't sell with most.

0670026638|5.0|This book is excellent, the way it is written and how it deals with subjects like suicide, depression and how to try to manage them!<br />The reader learns a lot about Japanese culture and history (WW II) as well as geography e.g. the islands of British Columbia.<br />I know once I have finished it, I have to read it again. There is so much to learn!<br />Renate Kellhammer

B001UTW7QU|5.0|I really enjoyed the first few seasons, then like most it starts to drag on. But, for a person who doesn't usually like sci-fi, I found myself really liking it! Recommended!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Really enjoyed this film. It focused on a short period of time, but in a way that taught me a lot about history and the character of Abe Lincoln. The first few minutes are quite graphic.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|THIS IS THE MOST AMAZING PUZZLE. It makes you think logically. It is not so difficult that it becomes frustrating but certainly a wonderful challenge. A puzzle like I have never seen before. There is a help button and an online walk through which is easily found. I highly recommend this puzzle and am anxiously awaiting the next puzzle.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|This is my favorite Jane Austen novel. The characters come alive from the very beginning and the plot seems plausible.
B005MMZ63C|3.0|Everyone should watch this film for posterity's sake. Other than that, it's really not that fantastic. Stick with Streetcar. I'll take Lawrence of Arabia any day over this film.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Truly a shame they only got one season out.  Someone with deep pockets should try again, though I'm sure they would have trouble getting the crew together.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This series is more than just  entertaining (though it was very entertaining.) It tells the hopes and dreams and  struggles the people of that time faced and how they overcame. Lessons we can all benefit  from.
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|Though I would have been confused if I didn't know the background or hadn't seen the dramatic version several years ago, I thought Les Miserables was very well done!  Hugh Jackman was phenominal as John Valjean and Anne Hathaway earned her best supporting actress Oscar as Fantine!  The music was emotionally beautiful and having the actors actually sing brought the emotion to life!  Russell Crowe must have gotten some excellent singing lessons because he had a commanding voice!  For enthusiasts of the stage show and the dramatic movie, Les Miserables is a must see!
B006M4TBWG|5.0|This posthumous release totally captures Amy's true talent and understanding for jazz, r&b and hip hop. It's a must-have piece for any fan.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|I thought The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was terrific and stood well with the 3 sequels of The Lord of the Rings!  An imaginative tale is well told with beautiful scenery and awesome visual effects!  Martin Freeman was wonderful as a young Bilbo Baggins and Ian McKellen was his usual outstanding self as Gandalf!  I look forward to the next installment of the Hobbit trilogy!
B00B19DMUE|2.0|I can't fault the actors but, I didn't understand the story or like the film. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
B0039HR5QS|5.0|Showing my age, I first saw this moving when I was in high school.  It has great way of bringing you into the plot.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Having started the series in college and waiting sometimes years between book releases, this was a series that has been a companion throughout my adult life.  Like many, I was concerned when Sanderson was given the daunting task to close the epic series.<br /><br />I consider myself fortunate to have experienced both Jordan and Sandersons' mastery in the world created throughout the series.<br /><br />The final episode was very well done and I was left feeling satisfied and of course a bit sad, knowing this was the final turn of the wheel.<br /><br />I hope Mr. Jordan would be proud of the commitment to complete his life's work.

B007ZSBQYE|2.0|Well, the best thing about this game is its pretty unique in theme. I think it would be more fun with actual parking challenges though. Like parallel parking. Instead its basically get through an obstacle course to the parking spot(finish line).<br /><br />The thing that makes this game hard is the controls are not very good. A challenge is one thing, a fight with the way you control your car is something completely different.<br /><br />Another thing I dislike about this game is the 3 strikes your out. I'd like to be able to finish a course, even if to many hits means I fail at the end at least I can get to the end and try to beat my own record.<br /><br />Right now this app is okay, but it doesn't have to be just OK. It has potential to be a lot more.
0307352153|5.0|This book by Susan Cain really resonated with me as I am an introvert (well-disguised at times, but an introvert). My belief that I am an introvert was reinforced with the results of the short questionnaire contained on pages 13 and 14.<br /><br />The book is divided into four parts: The Extrovert Ideal; Your Biology, Your Self?; Do All Cultures Have An Extrovert Ideal; and How To Love, How To Work. These sections are well researched and supported with numerous examples and notes. The author writes in a style that is easy to read and understand. The end of the book contains additional material that includes a reader's guide, recommended reading list, and resources for readers.<br /><br />I really connected with this book as I read each chapter and it helped me to better understand myself and why I react to various stimulation as I do and also how I have adapted to be seen as more of an extrovert than I really am.<br /><br />I can turn it on (being extroverted) when I need to, but then I really need time to decompress afterwards in order to maintain my equilibrium and sense of self-worth. If I don't get the opportunity to decompress, I can really feel the stress level increase which impacts everything I do.<br /><br />I can be a social person, but I prefer interacting in a one to one or small group setting so I am able to better focus on what others are communicating. I prefer watching a baseball game on television (often with the sound muted) as I don't need the announcers telling me what is happening or the chaos, noise, and music at the ball park. I want to watch and enjoy the game. I don't need all of the other hoopla.<br /><br />If you are uncertain as whether or not to read this book, I would recommend that you listen to Susan's Ted Talk on YouTube on the subject.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this book for anyone in a leadership position so that you better understand yourself or the near 50% of the people that you are leading. I also recommend this book for those of you who suspect that you are an introvert or that your spouse or child is an introvert. It also presents some very interesting reading for those in the education system.those of you who suspect that you are an introvert or that your spouse or child is an introvert.

B007BVMVDU|1.0|Simply put, this series is not in HD. The quality of the video we were watching was, at best, DVD quality. We had no problems playing other HD content, so no, it wasn't our 30MB broadband connection. We waited a good 10 minutes into the episode to see if the quality would improve, to no avail.<br /><br />Thankfully, Amazon was very courteous and understanding. Not only did they refund our money for the season we bought, but they actually gave us a promotional credit to purchase the blu-ray(which was about $10 more) so that we got it for the same price as the Instant Video. Someone must have screwed up on the technical end of the streaming content, but the customer service department is going above and beyond. Bad rating aside, thank you Amazon!
B00B7VPKMY|5.0|Gave this to my teenage granddaughter to introduce her to the best of my generation of music. She loves &#34;Hotel California&#34; and &#34;Seven Bridges Road&#34;, but raved about &#34;In a New York Minute&#34;.We really bonded talking about the lyrics.
B00AX7PGQS|5.0|If you like art that challenges you to think and which is flawlessly executed, I cannot recommend this flick enough.  So well thought out and brilliantly crafted.
B0073PZU82|5.0|As they were falling in love, Daniel Craig and Rachel Weitz were making this movie. I heard a quote from someone working on the movie. They said, &#34;You could tell he was in love with her by the way he watched her when she was acting, and in the dailies&#34;. Great mystery thriller. And played beautifully by the couple.
B004TTZHBK|4.0|I originally downloaded this for my phone when it was the free app of the day. It was alright then, though the videos and pictures weren't big enough to be super helpful; on the kindle fire however, it's almost perfect, with just two issues that I can note:<br /><br />1) only allows one axis for portrait or landscape viewing, that's just not helpful.<br />2) videos never download when you queue them from the recipe pages, you have to remove them from the queue, go to the video page and set them to download again.<br /><br />Outside of that, I love this app. I've made several of the recipes, they have all turned out very well.
B003XFVSTG|5.0|We all know how beautiful Nicole is but I have never seen her do camp. She does it quite well. With all the things going on in this film, the music and dancing, the costumes and staging take the show.
B000HVHM5S|5.0|Especially today, the frustration of many about the workings of the govt play out in this film. Great story well done.
B00338QENI|3.0|As someone familiar with HeLa cells and the important role they have played in scientific discovery, I looked forward to reading this book.  Sadly, as the last half turned into more of a story about the author's relationship with the family, its writing style seemed to deteriorate. I found myself skimming to the end.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen! Iam a caregiver for my husband and I feel ALL CAREGIVERS should see this movie. There is so much meaning, laughter,scary and true moments and it blows my mind that it's based on a true story!! I can't believe no one told me to see this movie when it was in the US. The French film uses subtitles and they didn't bother me at all. Both of the main actors were endearing and loveable especially in the funny scenes. Bravo for the film's director and cast. I also bought a copy for my best friend and she loved it as much as I did as we laughed and cried. Later I told a whole Caregiver's Retreat Group to go and rent this movie!!!!
B00CEF014E|3.0|If you've seen the 1973 cult film \\"The Wicker Man,\\" you'll have a pretty good idea what Damian Stevenson's SOLSTICE is all about.  Dana March is in Oklahoma to introduce her new boyfriend, Jack Harris, to her sister Zoe.  But when she wakes up in their motel room the first morning, Jack is nowhere to be found . . . and no one seems to believe he ever existed.  It turns out sister Zoe is living at a pagan commune called \\"The Rainbow Collective,\\" run by a fanatic who believes in appeasing \\"the old gods\\" when things aren't going well (like when it hasn't rained for over 100 days and the commune's crops are failing).  Dana is \\"The Wicker Man's\\" Sergeant Howie - both are investigating a mysterious disappearance and both get sucked into something they don't expect.  By the time Dana figures out what's going on, all hell has broken loose and she has to do anything and everything to survive.<br /><br />The similarities to \\"The Wicker Man\\" are way too prevalent here, including some of the dialogue.  The novel's \\"Summer Solstice Fair\\" is very similar to \\"The Wicker Man's\\" May Day celebration, complete with the Master using an axe to make an offering of a barrel of wine (in \\"Wicker Man\\" it's beer) and the promise of more terrible sacrifices to come.  While Stevenson does take his story in a different direction about two-thirds of the way through, I definitely felt like I'd been there, done that for much of the novel.  Additionally, I'm not sure why Stevenson decided to set his \\"Rainbow Collective\\" in a place called \\"Thornhill,\\" with a housekeeper called \\"Mrs. Fairfax\\" - I kept expecting some sort of connection to JANE EYRE, but nothing materialized.<br /><br />This is a very short novel - more a long short story, actually; it took me about two hours to read from start to finish.  It's written in a clipped, bare-bones style that avoids description and is almost totally focused on plot - for example, when Stevenson introduces Sheriff Mike Fisher and his deputy Pamela Reese, he writes, \\"They liked each other.\\"  That says it all, I guess, but it does mean we don't get much more about these two (or about any of the other characters, including Dana).  This style works best if you're looking for a fast-paced story and don't want to bother with characterization or things making much logical sense.<br /><br />SOLSTICE's final act involves a lot of running and hiding, and plenty of bloody confrontations between Dana and her monstrous pagan pursuers.  While she does rise to the occasion - and I always like horror novels with strong female protagonists - it comes too late here to make me care much about her.  There's just not enough background on Dana to make her more than a prop in the novel's bloody finale.<br /><br />Finally, I'm not sure what to make of the formatting of this novel - the type size on my Kindle was HUGE (even after adjusting to the smallest type-size available, there were only ten lines of text on any one page).  Add to that the many odd breaks between paragraphs or lines of dialogue, and I found myself turning pages every few seconds.  I have an older model Kindle, so this may be an issue with compatibility, but it's never happened before (and I've read hundreds of books on this device).<br /><br />Bottom line, SOLSTICE isn't a bad story, but it's definitely derivative (if you know \\"Wicker Man,\\" you'll know what you're getting).  It's a quick read and it's all plot - if that works for you, then SOLSTICE would be a good choice.  If you prefer a bit more substance with your blood-and-guts, maybe not.<br /><br />[Please note:  I was provided a copy of this novel for review; the opinions expressed here are my own.]rites, \\"They liked each other.\\"  That says it all, I guess, but it does mean we don't get much more about these two (or about any of the other characters, including Dana).

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Update 5-26-13: ok ... I'm pretty darned good at it now with scores running about 1.2million. And I still play it at least for a few minutes every day... even if it's just so I don't lose my daily challenge bonuses, lol! I can honestly say after a month of daily play that this game continues to earn the 5 stars I gave it originally.  Here is my original review (about a month old):<br /><br />Can't say I'm very good at it yet, but it's way fun, a little silly, and frustrating enough to keep me playing. Enjoy!
B00AU15HPC|5.0|Stumbled upon this album today.  Haven't had a happier surprise in years.  This is pure Hayward.  Pulls you along slowly, washing you in great playing and, of course, singing.  Interesting retelling of \\"It's Cold Outside of Your Heart\\", casting it more into a stripped down arrangement that fits nicely.  Also a re-recording of \\"Broken Dream\\" (from his last solo album) gets a minimalist mix.  If you like Moody Blues, give this a listen.  If you like Justin Hayward, do not hesitate.
B009KWU6Q2|5.0|It's a classic! How could anyone not like this movie. Some kids movies definitely ave lost their appeal to kids today, sadly because of animation but this stands the test of time for sure.
B007KOYEOC|3.0|Lost it in the third volume. Maybe I will get back to it one day but it seemed to lose the energy that was there in vol 1 and 2.
B005MLP71Y|5.0|My kids love this movie. Even my 13 year old will still watch it...which says a lot as he is so cool these days ;)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Excellent fun game that's interesting and fun for all ages! I did notice the game would stop working sometimes but it worked best if you didn't connect to the internet/WiFi.
B0097JYVAU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book - Nate Silver's blog was the reason I subscribed to The New York Times, and the book does an excellent job of expanding on the statistical ideas behind his modelling, and examining the applicability and success of prediction in many fields.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|It's more zombie history than zombie attack but a good read. Creepy because it's very realistic and practical if the world did get over run by zombies.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Love this knife... Did change a few things, but what a great hunk of steel. Was a bit interesting to sharpen... Still getting it just right, but this thing will hold an edge for sure.  Just a great deal..... Period
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gillian Flynn created some great characters. Loved the twists and turns of the plot.  The ending left me slightly disappointed though.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is another great program from PBS!  Believable characters..Looking forward to the next season.  Keep them coming.  Will watch other programs from PBS
B008ELUEQC|5.0|This is Rod personified.  As usual his music was great and the selections were wonderful!!!  We enjoyed this all through the Christmas season.  Highly recommend.
0767812166|5.0|Only wish they would have made a second movie. My husband loves this movie and watches it quite often.Good movie
0307455874|5.0|Great read about our President.  Helps to understand his thinking and where he is coming from.  I recommend it for anyone who doesn't understand why he feels like he does!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a no brainer! I like how large it is also. I am older and it is easy on.my eyes. Thanks.
B002SEW5WW|5.0|We purchased this after we heard them on one of the AM morning news shows.  I love their music and will put this CD on when I am cleaning house or have activities to do.  It peps me up and away I go!
0062082353|5.0|Too bad the best sniper who ever lived was killed back here.  This book is well written despite some reviews.  I felt as if I knew Chris Kyle and enjoyed the story of his life and how he became a Navy Seal.  His frank plain perspective of how Seals train and how they fight was fantastic.  He would add some observations about the leadership and how they thought.  Priceless.  What a true American hero!!!!
B005DJREJS|4.0|I liked the characters. Some fun situations.  I wanted to keep going with the series.  I'd recommend this show for a younger &#34;teenage &#34; group.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|MY DAUGHTER WILL PLAY THIS GAME ALL DAY....EVERY DAY, IF I LET HER! SHE EVEN HAS HER COUSIN HOOKED. I DON'T GET IT ,BUT SHE LOVES IT!
B005LAIIJY|4.0|There are two things you should know going into this movie: First, this is a Tarintino movie. That mean there will be gratuitous violence and blood splattering. Second, this is a Tarintino movie. That means that if you're either a die-hard conservative OR liberal, your delicate sensibilities will be offended by the depiction of what white Southerners circa 1850 were actually like. (Whereas die-hard conservatives like to whitewash history, no pun intended, and die-hard liberals will wince at the drop of every N-bomb.) The movie itself is one of Tarinino's best except for two noticeable flaws. The first is that for a great deal of the movie, Foxx's character, Django, spends a lot of his time in the shadow of other characters, most notably DiCaprio's turn as a plantation owner. In fact by the time Django and Shultz reach Candieland, the movie is practically turned over to DiCaprio's Calvin Candie (and to a lesser extent, Samuel L. Jackson's role as Stephen). Despite the film's title, it's never fully Django's movie, at least not until the end. The second flaw again comes during the film's time at Candieland, which - despite DiCaprio and Jackson's best efforts - dragged about 20 minutes too long. I count these complaints as more than trivial and enough to deny the movie's perfection even though the rest of the movie wins on every other account; the casting, the acting, the cinematography, the comic relief, and especially the score - no one matches music to movies better than Tarintino. At 2 hours and 45 minutes, yes, the movie is too long. But it's less torture than 90 minutes of even the best rom-com.
B0031R5K8G|4.0|An awesome read ..<br />M not a regular reader but after reading just a single page of this novel I was so attracted towards it and finished it in just 4 days .,<br />Awesome novel with interesting facts .. Must read
B004AUNSX2|1.0|The movie was too slow and boring.  I barely could make it to the end.  It didn't seem to really have much of a story to it either.
B00338QENI|5.0|Very interesting book that everyone should read.  Incredible story of a wonderful woman, Henrietta, her children, and the outcome of the cancer cells taken from her in her young life.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I stumbled across this show by accident on Prime. It is one if the best series I have seen. I watched 2 whole seasons in a weekend
B004Q7CIFI|1.0|If I had any idea what I was getting myself into, I would never have attempted reading this book.  I read if for a book club.  I stayed up one night to finish it... and missed the book club meeting!<br /><br />Exasperatingly long and convoluted.
B004UHL9EK|4.0|A lot of great options to choose from, but my favorite is the alarm clock!  It has been very useful for me.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I loved this book.  I read it for a book club and did not notice the similarities to the Holocaust...  when children were hidden for their own protection.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|My son and I love this movie.  We watched it twice and I plan to buy it.  A fun family movie!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Anybody who remembers the play/movie &#34;The Bad Seed&#34; does not need to bother reading this book.<br /><br />Not enough closure at the end.
B00881PTRC|4.0|It is a fun game!  The only issue I have is that I wish it would give you a question to help you solve the word.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|Tried to watch this movie twice.  Fell asleep early in the movie both times.<br /><br />Was not at all what I expected.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|..You run out of energy to do things around your town?! & everyone else stands around while you get your town going on your own.Theres so many things you can build but then you need to build the supplies to build what you need.Its alot of building without many reward other than being a good way to get you leveled up quickly.Atleast this game updates often & its free.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|As a fan of Daft Punk since the days when \\"Around the World\\" was released, I was anxiously waiting to see how their new album was going to sound. If this track is any indication of what the rest of the album is going to be, I can't wait for the full album.<br />\\"Get Lucky\\" is catchy, disco style funk with just enough electronic flavor to know it's Daft Punk. The Niles Rogers guitar riff through out is awesome, classic disco. Exactly what you'd expect from a disco pioneer as him. Daft Punk fans will not be disappointed.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|My kids love this game & all the creatures & their families you can get.The graphics are really smooth & adorably animated(The glacier & the rainbows are the best) also the audio too.If your family are fans of this franchise..get this game.SCRAT RULES!
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read all of the books in the Mitch Rapp series.  I love the history Flynn provides along with a thrilling story.  I have turned several of my friends on to this series and they are just as devoted as am I.  This makes a fabulous Fathers Day gift.  Mothers Day too if they enjoy political thrillers
B009GEFXLC|5.0|The new relationship between Castle and Beckett is fun and overdue. I like that they are delving more deeply in Castle's past and the other detective's background this season.
B00B935SUY|5.0|this movie held my attention from start to finish.  I watched it at least 4 times.  so many priceless moments in it. An important document of not just the studio, but of rock and roll
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Granted, I'm only 2/3 of the way through the book, but I'm enjoying it just as much as I enjoyed the first book in the series. I'd say it takes a little longer to get off the ground, but by the time you start nearing the end, the excitement really starts to ratchet up. If you're a fan of knights and lords and far off lands and such, these books will serve you well. The gritty realism with which the stories are told is an interesting change from, say, a Tolkien or a Piers Anthony. I love them.
B008476HBM|5.0|I finally decided to read this classic novel. I just loved it. When i tried to read it before i didn't like the was it read. That was before I started watching Downton Abbey. I am used to the way they talk now and just really loved this book.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|The movie was very much like the book and we enjoyed both.  The setting of the Hobbit was just beautiful.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I love this game. pretty easy but enjoyable game play. it went quickly but I will replay. highly recommended. Can't wait for updates.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Being married to a doctor it was very informative to get an inside view from a scientific brain about how it sees a totally spiritual and faith based experience.
B001AQQR2S|5.0|It's one of those movies that even as a male adult I can still enjoy. It is fun, funny and has a positive feeling. I like Danny Devito and his wife so this adds to the movie. I've watch it when I get in the mood for just entertainment and little thinking. Great movie.
B005R32L66|4.0|I found this App very useful for communication while you are in the go. I installed in a Samsung Galaxy Tablet.
B000JZ68GG|3.0|I saw this movie in the theater back in, as I recall the 60's, and liked it a lot.<br />I thought I would watch it again this 45 years later. It wasn't too good this time. The graphics are obviously so dated as to be silly but at the time were good. The story leaves a lot to be desired. If you have never seen it you might enjoy the retro feeling.
B000JMKNJ2|4.0|The Lies of Locke Lamora begins with a strong Dickens twist (if you will) and quickly draws the reader into  the life of a very young boy who has learned to survive on his wits and luck.  Is that skill learned or was he born with it?  At any rate as he grows older his skills are honed as he learns to trust other unfortunate whelps while stealing from the rich and powerful. He is a master of deceit but there are other forces out there which he cannot see, who are working to eliminate him or possible use him.<br />The language is utterly profane and hilarious to the older reader.  I found myself laughing out loud at the black humor.  These are boy books...but older boy...seniors in high school and young readers.  My thirty year old son loved it and we have bought the series.  I hope Scott Lynch continues to write...a little faster.  You have a following!
B00BF11STU|5.0|Despite the politics involved, this was an excellent movie. Acting involved across the board was excellent, and the action at the end was intense and well-directed. Overall highly reccomend
B009KWU6Q2|5.0|This is my all time favorite movie. The first time I watched it I was reminded I had forgotten how to be a child. I found the child in me in the words \\"Oh there you are\\". My life has changed for the better because of this film.
0316228532|1.0|I had only read the first Harry Potter book and, though I'm not into the fantasy genre, found it well written and engaging.  I was surprised to hear about the subject matter of The Causal Vacancy - it sounded like an impossibly boring idea for a novel, but I figured that an author of Rowling's stature might be able to twist it into something interesting.  I was wrong. I read about 1/3 of the book before I gave up, never having connected with any of the characters.  I really didn't care who lived and died, or if the low-rent tract of land went to this town or that.  Other reviewers say this was an in-depth study of human emotion and relationships, but I never ran across that aspect of it.  Try again, Ms. Rowling, and this time choose a more interesting concept, and populate it with at least one character with depth.
B0012GTZC0|4.0|Fast moving, action packed spy thriller. From the basements of Whitehall to the Scottish Isles, the trail is hot. A great read with all the ingredients of a nail biter to the last page.
B009VB97EY|2.0|It was a poorly constructed story that didn't even make sense, the only value was to see male strippers for 90 minutes. I feared that this would be the case and sadly I was right.
B006X08FDA|5.0|I like the history of the songs they sing and how they explain where the songs come from in the pamplet inside the cover.
B000VCLGBY|5.0|I've loved this movie since it came out.  I was so happy to be able to get it on instant streaming for only $10!! Always a classic
B00498YZH8|5.0|The title of my review tells most of my impression of this movie. It is taken from the email I sent to someone right after I saw picture. The acting, to a cold eyed critic might seem low key, but it's RIGHT on key. There is power, often scary, in every look, word, motion and scene. Even the &#34;happy&#34; ending is fraught with portent of the continuing struggle of the heroine's life. To me, this film is the exemplar of real movie making. If there are any special effects, they are not detectable. It will stay with me for a long time and I will need to revisit it. I will certainly buy a copy.
B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|I watched the ring trilogy too many times.  It didn not spark my interest and I wished it had come out first.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I haven't read the book, but the movie was well worth the 2:15 length.  I'm sure the book was better, as usual, but all-in-all a well produced movie.  Highly recommend for Ages 13+.
B00683JLXA|5.0|Bravo, this game is fun and challenging and the art is a breath of fresh air. Ignore the negative reviews. The makers of this game have done well in creating a different take on a familiar genre and it works well.Well done, bravo
0385349947|1.0|This book is an ego ornament for a woman who made an insane amount of money for playing the I-can-have-it-all game.<br />She's essentially a selfish person looking for more validation by telling the world how compassionate she is.<br />That she doesn't care enough about her children to raise them even though money is no object for her,illustrates she<br />just wants more and more for herself, including a legacy of vanity publishing. 99.999999% of the worlds women<br />would have nothing to learn from this book. She doesn't grasp that most mothers work jobs because they simply have to pay the bills as the American dream is now gone for the middle-class. She will alas, spawn more like her, the next of \\"the greediest generations\\"<br />that brought us Wall st banksters and corporatocracy USA.<br />Any wonder that the children of these narccisists usually destroy themselves by their college years requiring rehab or lots<br />of lawyers?
B00821PCJS|5.0|I really have enjoyed this program.  I don't know why I didn't watch it during the regular season, but I love it.  My nine year old daughter doesn't enjoy it, she thinks it is kinda scary. So maybe this isn't something you want to watch with your whole family.
B007ZSBQYE|1.0|I really like the graphics and the game has potential to be really.good, the controls are.horrible!  I did.have an issue.with it going.to a white screen with nothing but the car showing after I failed a level but I.hit restart and it fixed it. I mute sounds.so.I can't comment on the music but I didn't find an option to.turn it off. Overall it could be great if the controls were better
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|One of those rare CD's that when you start listening to it you sit still, not wanting to move, and become more and more amazed with every passing song.
B001NHNG64|5.0|When is the next movie??? Have read eight books since taking son to see movie - not once been disappointed. Seriously good reading.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This took me a while. Real brain teaser.  Kept my interest. One of the best puzzle games I've played. Can't wait for more rooms!
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|I've been a fan of NKOTB since 1989 and this album didn't disappoint!  I liked each song and even got my mom to like this album!
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I really enjoyed the characters, I thought Don was priceless.  A great laugh out loud book at times.  I would recommend it!  It's light hearted and easy to read.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|really great-fun game. I find myself picking it up and playing it when I get really bored. I have enjoyed it alot

B004ADH1RI|5.0|My daughter first saw this movie when she was 8 years old and loved it... now, my granddaughter age 7 has added it to her favorites list.  It is a refreshingly funny and exciting movie for young and old alike.  Classic kid's adventure!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This is a story about love happiness and how one person can change your life forever.

But when her horrible past follows abby and tests her relationship with travis is their love enough  Jamie has written beautiful characters that sgile my heart a first glance and happily eve after couldnt seem more impossible
B0059XTUVI|1.0|It seems the writers/director/producers despised Maggy Thatcher. Hollywood's animus toward conservative politicians is the hallmark of the movie. Rather than focusing on the parts of her life when she was lucid and rational, the bulk of the movie spent time with her mental decline and hallucinations. They portrayed her as pitiful, lost, and doddering. I felt like I was in a nursing home watching a resident. Though I'm sure there were things about Maggie Thatcher they wanted me to disdain, I left the movie only disdaining the persons who put this garbage together. On a good note, Meryl Streep can do no wrong as an actor regardless of the monster in which she is cast.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless is about Sky a girl who meets Dean Holder. Holder is a intese case of pure sexiness. But Holder has a secret. A secret about his past that Sky is a part of.

Where a terrible discovery hasthem both hanging on to each other lik never before. Hopeless is emotional its full of heart love and the connection between to people thats stronger than time its self
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I love scifi and fantasy tv series.  The series combines scifi and homor with a bit of romance thrown in for spice.
B000002VRZ|5.0|Great riffs on the title song! Seventies band not forgotten will be looking at where they are now and more.
034580404X|1.0|I should not have purchased the trilogy. I read half of the first book, thought it was a bunch of trash and ended donating all three books to my local library. Maybe some one will appreciate her writing more than I did.
B000W93CHC|4.0|A kind of book you start to read and cannnot just put aside...it made some of my sleepless nights. Surprisingly, I did not mind it:-)
B0064X7FVE|5.0|The Weather Chanel is my favorite TV<br />Program. Jim Cantore makes my day when he reports hurricanes.. He should know better than to stand outside in inclimet weather but it is<br />A hoot to watch him get blown away every time.<br />When I use the app for The Weather Chanel<br />It reminds me of Jim and the gang.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|We have two girls ages 8 and 5. This turned out to be their new favorite movie. They've watched it about 10 times now and they love to pretend to be the different characters. I think our 8 year old has a small crush on Jack :)
B0053O89WY|5.0|This is season five of the Big Bang Theory.  Still a great show.  They could tone down the sex stuff to make it more family friendly.  But that is Hollywood.  I don't expect it.
1451613512|3.0|I see a lot of reviews claiming \\"So Informative!!!\\"  Not really.<br /><br />I also have to laugh at the sheeple claiming this book is too dark.  The real history is a whole lot darker lol.<br /><br />This book makes no mention of Prescott Bush and his \\"trading with the enemy charges\\" not to mention the other roles he played in American history including his tutelage of R. Nixon and getting George Herbert Walker B into the CIA all leading up to the assasination of JFK<br /><br />This book mirrors the Oliver Stone version of JFK(In the JFK section) in that it doesn't even scrape the surface of what really happened and why.<br /><br />No mention on how the federal reserve works, who runs it, the impacts it had, why it was established, how it was opposed by Andrew Jackson(then called the second bank of america and yes took place before the timeframe of this book) and JFK.<br /><br />Absolutely no mention of the House of Rothschild, which is a huge let down.<br /><br />A very modest take on 9/11<br /><br />Sides with the common crap that we were in Iraq for oil...what a joke.<br /><br />This book also tries way too hard to use unnecessary vocabulary, making it a burden at times.<br /><br />All in all this book takes the written history of America and turns the blame on the US.  Hardly eye opening.  It doesnt identify any real conspiracies, as US history goes much deeper than this.<br /><br />To all of you who are \\"blown away\\", congrats on getting your feet wet.
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|quality show that you can actually watch with out all the smutt, some SUGGESTIVE but not as bad as some, so the whole family can actually watch it  so far.....
B003UBTX6S|3.0|This book just never slowed down enough for the characters to seem like real people and I found myself getting bored toward the ending.  Some the the drama could of been used in the last book to make the whole series better.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|doesn't  need all the smutt, but it is different and very well done, hope to see Jeffy get his dues.....LOL  the best evil guy on TV
B00A757EFW|5.0|Love the game, it feels like your playing at the arcade. I would recommend this game to anyone at any age who loves pacman.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|We all sit down to see Walking dead!  You Never know whos going to get it next, though we love the current characters and would like to see them stay alive  cant wait to see how the new ones develop  for season 4
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome, fun, &amp; addictive although, it can take an extremely long time until a new character can be unlocked by gaining objects in the box or collecting enough coins. Still, I recommend
B006LSZECO|5.0|I read this because I heard good things about it.  I was not disappointed.  Not only was it a good story, but it was not predictable.  I enjoyed the twists, but I was a little disappointed in the ending.  Not enough to change my review.  I would read this again!
B008H7HE9S|4.0|Not as jazzy as some songs on the older CD's. Still good, but for different reasons. I haven't grown to love this CD yet, but I definitely like it.
B00BY7NK96|5.0|I really liked this book. And I could relate to some of the examples in my career.<br />A good read !
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|I expected to fall more in love with the whole CD than I have. So far, anyway. While I enjoy most of it, some of the songs I could leave off my list.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|One of the best books I have read recently. Kept me spellbound until the end - and I very much enjoy Gillian Flynn's style of writing.<br />Fantastic  !!!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Bingo Blitz. It was the best to play!But with all the updates it freezes up! It was so much better before! I've been trying to complete New York for ever just need to Washington bridge & Universe! I had never brought B' s until two weeks ago within 48 hours I purchased 235 B' s twice,got maybe too bingo' s out of all those purchased! If you go to Support and report it they never get back with are do anything! I know people are not happy with the new updates.The customer no service!
B00AZF13KG|5.0|Great guy movie at a great price.  If you've never seen this, don't let a Rosie O'Donnell appearance scare you away.  Entertaining from start to finish, it is definitely worth this amazing price on Blu-ray.
B007KZY1YY|4.0|it is romantic and creative, although the author has potential for better stories, and sweep the readers off their feet.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I really love this app but when you have neighbors they stay in your manor and its a pain but otherwise it's a good app
B007L3BMGA|4.0|its pretty awesome. its not just the concept but the way the story has been written. i just couldn't put the book down till i finished it :)
B005LAIIKI|1.0|Really?  And then we wonder why children commit unspeakable acts. Then to go out and brag about a movie where someone kills all of a certain race. Wonder how that would have flown if the colors were reversed?
B007KOYEOC|3.0|there was nothing in this book that came with any surprise. the epilogue was far more interesting than the whole book. seems like the author wrote this just to finish up the mess she started with a mind to give Ana and Christian a happy ending.<br />I still look forward to what will come next from EL. James, but only if it is unrelated to the damn fifty shades.
B0076DELIG|5.0|It's nice to have a good guy who does the job in spite of opposition.  Just enough suspense to be fun and enough action to be believable.
B00B0U2SFE|5.0|Excellent movie.  Not a happy time in history, but accurately portrayed in the film.  This may be Spielberg's best film ever, although Lincoln is at least a close second.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Can't believe how many balls in the air Sheryl has at one time.  Made me realize that I never stopped long enough to count my own! Can now (as a senior citizen) count the many opportunities and offerings I missed because my confidence was so much less than what other people saw in me. This wonderful book gives me permission to share and explain Sheryl's positive energy to my large group of young friends, while I use myself and my mistakes as an example.  The book also makes me proud of what I have accomplished!
B00BGIBVRG|5.0|If you are in demo, there are so many points of reference; Funny, and scarily true. Just as good as any other Apatow/Rudd production.
B008602KQI|5.0|I loved the book series and this film was not a let down. I can't wait for the sequels to come out.
B00BBA6FOI|5.0|Read it, start a conversation a about it and pass it on! This book is starting a movement that is rippling across the world. Yes it's written from an American perspective, but I found the lessons just as relevant when I had conversations about gender with colleagues from Egypt, Oman and UAE. Thank you Sheryl sandberg for having the courage to write this book and start the conversation that is so direly needed!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|If you haven't seen this series it's really acting at it's finest. The writing is wonderful, the plots evolve nicely and it's hard to keep from  watching them all at once.
B00ABGEFWC|2.0|I really enjoy this game but I'ge reached 100 pets and the game messes up at 100 so I'm pretty much done unless they can fix it. Which at this point they tell me there is no known solution. That was a month ago. So I'm not expecting to be able to play again anytime soon. Which is a huge disappointment to my daughter. Also, the prices they are asking for kibble and bling, which are the things you buy pets and houses with,  is insanely expensive. For one virtual pet you can pay $100 or more! That is completely unreasonable. I'd rather got to Target and buy my daughter $100 worth of physical toys. Petshop toys I. the real store are around $10 each or less. There is no reason to expect people to pay $100 for one virtual toy.  This game would be more fun if it cost less and continued to work after 100 pets, which took me forever to get to that point cause I didn't use real money. So after all my hard work and finally getting somewhere in this game my reward is the game quits on me.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|It is a great game if you are in to your imagination.For a7 year old girl.<br /><br />I love the game .<br /><br />........
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|this book is funny and full of suspense. I'm tearing out my hair waiting for \\"The House of Hades.\\"<br /><br />What happened when I read the ending<br /><br />WHY MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh horrors of horrors Then I died! Then I saw the house of hades was coming and I was fine<br /><br />ALMOST!!!!!!!!!
B00005V1WO|5.0|A feverish, unrelenting and attainable tale of terror. Four friends stay the night in a sprawling mansion and find themselves at the mercy of their own horrific imaginations. What really makes this a great film is that nothing seems too over the top. The horror that each of these people experience is something we can almost all relate to. It's humans being reduced to utter madness by their own unrelenting terror that they themselves have created!<br /><br />This movie is defiantly one you'll want/need to see over and over to catch things the next go around. It's often incoherent, hard to follow and confusing but in a way that makes it all the more horrifying and real. Its play on shadows and light work and bumps in the night all hit home with those of us who find ourselves scared in the dark and of the unknown. What is horrifying at first is often found to be just our imagination or a play on the lighting but this film plays on that and goes further.<br /><br />This is an extremely weird and original film with great acting and a talented musical score. I'd highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys horror films that don't need to rely on gratuitous gore or CGI but have a deep and engaging plotline.
B00C0W08XK|5.0|I never liked math in school they should have had a game liked this to let us use to get us. To use to numbers.f2f  Lots of fun good mind usage
B001P06GX4|5.0|This is by far my 7-year-old son's favorite game!  My 5-year-old likes it, but sometimes she struggles with the concept.  (Our runner-ups are Sequence For Kids and The Kids of Carcassonne.)  Prior reviewers have listed the rules of play and alternative methods, so I'll refrain from discussing in my review.  I will say that it never gets boring for the adults--which I find to be great as my son wants to play over and over again.  The game and pieces have been holding up well to our 3 months (and counting) of game playing.  I am glad I listened to the reviews.  The game does not disappoint!  Great, great game!
B00C1BTWV4|5.0|As far as entertainment film, delightful in all ways. Some holes in the script but who cares. Three more words.
B00BD2DRHW|3.0|The game is great however I'm stuck @ level 4. It always crash when I start playing the 3rd bridge. :(
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I totally love this app. I've tried tons of apps, but none come close to this one. You get to use your own music to wake you up. Perfect! Get it now! :)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love an adding machine but don't like dragging it out.  This has the buttons just like it on my kindle, same size and all!  Much faster than clicking it out on my laptop (no keypad) or phone.
B0019TSI8W|2.0|This film missed on all points, and I only gave it a two stars because I was curious enough to skip through instead of just turning it off.<br /><br />I think the people who say this film was all about Streisand's vanity were right. There are no funny lines. Though she supposedly is hopelessly frumpy and unattractive at the beginning, she's wearing plenty of makeup and looks attractive enough. She establishes her \\"coolness\\" by talking about love in a vulgar, profanity-laced lecture to an auditorium of students who in real life would have been yawning and rolling their eyes. Thank heavens for paid extras. There are plenty of scenes in the film that are supposed to feel \\"real life\\" - the beautiful sister who complains in deadpan that her new husband interrupted her lesbian fantasies, the fat friend who is angry when Streisand's character remakes herself into a sexy bombshell, the self-centered belittling mother who finally validates her daughter by admitting she's jealous (her sister also has a few \\"wise\\" words to welcome her to the world of competing for the attention of men)... it all feels superficial and shallow. It's too lightly done to deserve any of the kudos that Streisand-as-director seems to obviously want.<br /><br />I agree too with the people who say this film ultimately proposes diametrically opposing values. Her \\"plantonic\\" husband supposedly falls in love with her while she's not beautiful, but somehow does not realize it until she magically looks like she stepped off of a Vogue cover. Her \\"beautiful\\" new self does not act like her \\"real\\" self at all - suddenly she's extremely assertive and articulate about all the things she wants, not that that's unhealthy, but she clearly is now self-assured Barbara Streisand and not the character Rose.<br /><br />Overall I'd never watch this movie twice and kind of regret the time I spent watching it once, even though I skipped forward a lot. Meh and eeehhh, in summary.
B002BBJ52U|4.0|If you are home by yourself or having a girl's night this is the movie you want to watch. Every woman can relate to this movie
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I fell in love with this book from the very first page. Don - the main character - is not your usual leading man. He sees life in a very different way, and I envy his organisation when it comes to the housework, shopping and cooking.<br /><br />I love how he capitalises all interesting events in his life (such as The Wife Project), his bluntness, and how he seems like he is blind to the rest of the world.<br /><br />He's tenacious, caring, socially inept, funny and while he would probably be a totally infuriating real-life partner, he makes a fun character.<br /><br />I adored this book.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I used to be so angry when I didn't bring my calculator home and when the calculators at home were solar panels and I had to do it right under the light which in my home is harder than you think. now I just grab my tablet and do my homework. thank you calculator plus!!!
B008KRJWEK|5.0|This game i s so rad. I love it.<br /> It is a time waster.I still can't believe it is free.I love it.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I liked this app but it didn't work a few times for me and my tablet was not the problem. I have had this tablet for a number of years and only once did it not work. still a great app though!!!
B0083ZRAJS|3.0|Quick fantasy read. Interesting and different from the movie but with a new point of view and a good description of the beloved characters.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Its a very nice game to have to build your empire and go to war! I would suggest the Drapdects strong and cheep. this is a fun game with a lot of stratigic mind. Good Luck!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Sylvia Day does a great job of writing this story.  I want more :)<br />I highly recommend this book to every woman.
B004GHNH7Q|1.0|If only I had known prior to hitting that purchase button... Only wanted it for my son to read for a class and instead had to go out and buy the actual book. This was full of essays, while a great reference I didn't feel it was worth the money I spent on it. I wish I could get a refund.......
B005D9MUWY|5.0|wonderful, absolutely the best soft keyboard i've ever used and thats really all there is to say on the matter
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|Excellent movie.  Daniel day Lewis did a great job as President Lincoln.  He made us see Lincoln as a father, husband and a passionate president striving to beat slavery and bring a country together.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|After all the hype on TV about the Movie Life of Pi, I had to read the book.<br />I will not go see the movie because I don't think it would do the book justice.<br />One if never sure if it is a true story right to the end - I still don't know - It could be.<br /><br />I recommend it to anyone who has a good imagine - that helps to make the story real.
B00B7HQ1DA|5.0|The thing about Boz Scaggs is that he always has and still does, appeal to the young, the hip and the old. His delivery and production have always came across as totally sincere. Boz does not release songs, he releases works of commitment. Mr. Benton may have had a smash with the Tony Joe White written Rainy Night in Georgia, but on this release, Boz reworks the song and ends up owning it, not just doing another version. My personal favorite is Corrina, Corrina. Here again, another cover if you so desire to call it such, but once again, when listening, you do not automatically think of the other versions as this one is unique. The Boz penned originals show no drop in in his song writing abilities.  All of the songs are above average and totally reflect the album title Memphis. The city and the sound associated with it should indeed be proud.
B0091V6TF4|5.0|It is a very good cd. I remember all the songs from all the movies. A good collections of songs from the first to the last. Go get it.
B004355D8W|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed each selection & Mr. Collins voice is so smooth. Great buy, very happy with my purchase.<br />I purchased after watching the live concert on AXS,  Wonderful!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Bingo Blitz is by far the best bingo game, however, it has problems with losing connections, losing tournament rounds and board credits which is very frustrating. If it weren't for these problems I would rate it five star.
B0017I1IZA|3.0|I love these books and always enjoy the ride. That said this long awaited moment with Stephanie and ranger, all this tension and excitement about it was left very unfulfilled:/! There should have been some sort of emotion/passion/ heat in their encounter but it was cold, simple and not anything like it should have been, definetly dissapointed.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|If you are looking for a great movie with a story to match this is it.<br />extra words, extra words
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|Game works fine on my Kindle Fire HD.  The only thing I don't like is Dark Forest.  It is too dark.  I avoid it. Otherwise it is fine.
B007ZSBQYE|4.0|Please Asian friends don't get offended by I think this game is a good place to practice your driving maybe that way there isn't that much traffic every morning on the freeways all because of you know what  thumbs up if you agree
B007ZD17XO|1.0|It wouldn't download on my Kindle Fire HD so I would give it zero stars if I could.  I wasted my money.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|What an opening sequence of scenes! And the story that followed was very thought-provoking. What we can do even though we're not at our strongest! Denzel Washington mightily deserved his best actor nomination!
B00ATSBIIG|2.0|It gets hung up part way through a level and I have to skip the rest of that level and go to the next.  The puzzles are way to simple to be interesting or challenging.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is beautiful, and really shows the quality of this social network. I love it! Pinterest is awesome, and I love seeing the fashion on it.
B007SGM084|5.0|While reading I found I could connect with both main characters to some degree. I also could connect to the support characters to because me and my best friend are very protective of each other. While the books were great at some point I felt like I was reading a downward spiraling plot that did take a while to pick back up again. Finding out the back story on Mr. Grey was pretty interesting. In all not bad and I will recommend to others.
B001R3YRG2|5.0|A first class performance about an average working man whose cup of irritations has run over. He has a breakdown. It is mesmerizing to watch his descent from the white-shirt-and-tie good citizen into a dangerous madman. Fast food breakfast will never be the same.
B000002KCC|5.0|It's not Neil rockin' with Crazy Horse, it's not country Neil and it's not folkie Neil.  It's Just GREAT.  One of the best albums ever made.  Absolutely no attempt was made to re-record songs with mistakes and some songs are so raw and unpolished as to make you wonder how the record company allowed them to put it out.  But it works.  The sound of Ben Keith's pedal steel on 'Albuquerque' is the most haunting and melancholy sound I've ever heard on record. It and 'New Mama' - a short and pretty folkie number are two of the songs that actually are fairly polished. Tired Eyes has spoken verses about a drug deal that ends in gunfire that is like nothing you've ever heard. Neil goes above and beyond his usual coyote caught in a trap vocal yelp on 'Mellow My Mind' - one moment that might make you wince. 'Come On Baby Let's Go Downtown' (sung by Danny Whitten) and 'Lookout Joe' are the only real rockers here but this whole album is as rock and roll as it gets. It would have been Neil's next studio album after Harvest but was held back for a year.  At a time when LA rock was getting more and more polished this was a jolt of dirty stale air - a four o'clock in the morning - tequila bottles breaking - head on the bar - raunchy spirit of rock and roll intact music designed to be a wake for the recently deceased Danny Whitten and roadie Bruce Berry.  By the time the band lurches into 'Tonights The Night' for the 2nd time to close the album you'll either be smiling with happiness that such a record exists or you will have fled the house to play in the sunshine.  Some people make records that are a little off their usual game  - this one is completely off the rails in a good way - superbly captured by Neil's best producer David Briggs.
6305428425|3.0|With three powerhouse comediennes, I expected this movie to be a lot funnier. There are some bright moments, but the script is not all that funny, and transition from one scene to the next is jerky. One minute they're working out in the gym, next minute fighting in the car, next minute at the reunion. Looks as though a lot was left on the cutting room floor. As I prepare for my 40th (and first) high school reunion, it gives me some things to think about, though.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Good book.  But just felt a bit irrational at times.  Guess i just wasn't that surprised.  Too many things fell by the wayside in the end.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Truly a beautiful piece, written to shed light on a real issue and also, share a beautiful story about resilience.
B008XO7X4G|5.0|What a great classic movie!  If you've never seen it, you really should!  It has the most fascinating cast of characters!  It's also so real. The \\"freaks\\" are not at all what you'd think they're going to be. All around great movie.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Cheryl Strayed grips you from the very beginning and doesn't let go with Wild. The biographical story touched me in ways I wasn't expecting. Now I want an pilgrimage of my own.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|well it started out ok but then it didn't let me open it up! hmmm..... anyone have that problem?????well I sure did..
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This is a great app, I got it for free but I would have paid for it really helps you keep track of your batteries life
0395389496|5.0|Well this reminder came up in my e-mail after years of me purchasing these books.  The books are still being used to this day and they were an incredible buy.  We have done lots of projects with them.  Thank you very much
B001DM1VXE|4.0|Like the rest of the civilized world, I was aware of all the hype surrounding the movie Pi.  Unlike many, I did not rush out to my nearest theater while the hype was hot.  Frankly, I think Amazon Prime is one of the best ways to catch flicks that you've heard so much about.  That was definitely the case with Pi.  Visually it was quite stunning.  The storyline was interesting and provocative.  But in the end I'm glad my husband and I didn't go out and spend $10 per plus the cost of concessions.
B00BD2DRHW|5.0|My son is 5 and he loves the game alot he plays it everyday for about an hour and a half
B008602KQI|4.0|I'm not 14 years old.  I've never read the books.  I don't aspire to be the main character.  Two of those sentences are redundant after, &#34;I'm not 14 years old.&#34;  Nonetheless, when every teenage in America is electrified by a book, a movie and a character, I just had to see what it was all about.  Shirley Jackson's &#34;The Lottery&#34; meets Richard Connell's &#34;The Most Dangerous Game&#34; for a new look at man's inhumanity to man.  Or in this instance, man's attempted inhumanity to a bad-@$$ chick with a bow  and arrow.
0380730405|4.0|My book was used and had it's on commentaries written in the book ...loved it!!<br />Such innocentance and worldly traits at the same time.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|How interesting to read about the early Apple days. As someone who has owned many of these, starting with the Mac &#34;cube&#34;, I really enjoyed the back story. Also was interested to hear the rationale for lack of USBs and Flash in Apple products.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I just love the soothing selections I have with Relax Melodies.  I just listen to them for hours. They are very calming after a stressful day. Thank you for this great product.
B004WGIXX4|4.0|Cute movie, thought the casting was spot on.  Recommend for girls night or date night.  A good chick flick!  Enjoy
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|very relaxing and a pretty looking game<br />it is a nice casual game not too easy but not too challenging
B006215P8I|4.0|Started to get a bit strange but still very good. Some very interesting twists happen this season and I'm looking forward to see how they wrap everything in the next two seasons.
B00A77II0U|4.0|This game was just a little bit creepy, but the story was fun.  The find an image sections did tend to repeat a great deal, but they were interesting enough that I didn't mind too much.  I liked that there is a bonus chapter after the main game ends, but was very annoyed by the game nagging me for feedback as I progressed through the game.  This last detail cost it a star.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love it it is so much like the game I played years ago. Brings back fond memories and. Is very entertaining.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Good movie enjoyed it the guy who played Hans lander in inglorious bastards did great job in this movie. Jamie fox was great. Overall good movie from terentino
B00A77II0U|5.0|One of the best games of this type out there. Not too hard to frustrate you, and long enough to satisfy you, leaving you wanting more.  I would buy a sequel when they make one.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and am still reading the other books in the series. It grabbed my attention right away and held it all the way through.
B0088W6LGY|5.0|If I had to choose this would be my favorite over Star Trek Enterprise but that is only if I was forced to choose.
B00ADW4I9O|5.0|Forget long explanations. This is the HOLY GRAIL of Conan The Barbarian Soundtracks, period. Worth every penny. I'm supplicating Crom that he allows us a similar treatment with the Conan Destroyer Soundtrack. This is one of the most valued disc sets in my collection now.
B003O86FMW|5.0|So happy that I started reading all the books.  I could not put them down.<br />Enjoy them soooooooooooo much.<br /><br />Jackie-Wi
B0010VD7EO|3.0|I bought this CD for one song outside of  my preferred music genre.  I really enjoy the song. The rest of the disc didn't blow me away or anything but it didn't suck either so I was happy with the disc overall. Happy enough to try another one of their discs. That one I hated. :)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Finally got to see the movie and it was okay.  Love the book because it was a fast moving story. It will hold your interest.<br /><br />Jackie-WI
B007JNR518|5.0|I read the book and I loved it and I love Robert Redford so I had to see the movie. This film is fantastic, the musical score alone can capture the viewer. There's nothing fake about it. The cast works fabulously together as well. Also, Robert Redford's character is based off Buck Brenaman, I suggest watching the documentary titled Buck, based on his life.
0374531269|4.0|I have to say I personally hate reading books, especially boring ones. One thing about this book is that, it is not one of those books, it saddening and sickening, but definitely not boring. It is definitely a detailed book that can bring out your emotions.  \\"A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier,\\" is by Ishmael Beah. This book is all about Ishmael Beah's tragic childhood. When he was 12, and when the war started in Sierra Leone, many people Ishmael knew were killed. Him and many others saw people getting killed firsthand, wherever they ran they say death and blood. Not something people like us will see at all. This book mainly talks about all his experience when he was a child soldier, he and many others were caught and forced to kill. The book shows the disasters globalization can do to people. I feel that I had learned a lot from this book, many hardships and bad days that I had to go through and other people had to go through does not compare to the horror people like Ishmael had to face everyday. The book brings awareness of the tragedy children in other countries are facing and how it is still happening now. This book should be brought up in future classes because it a good read about how globalization can be a bad thing and it will also bring awareness on this situation most people do not know.
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|This is the first Christina Aguilera album I've purchased since Stripped and it's absolutely fantastic! This album has a little bit of everything; the naughty, the soulful and fun pop. Christina Aguilera is at the top of her game on this album.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Good movie. Kids liked it. Easy to download the movie onto computer from Amazon. Definitely would download more Amazon movies again.
B0060MYM7O|4.0|Again, I've read the books and I am so pleasantly surprised with how much HBO was able to capture from the novel. I don't think this season created as much drama and magic as the first but it's still worth watching.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|Love it!  I use it all the time even when I'm in a restaurant and music is playing in the background.  Is a must have.
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|I had no idea what this film was about but given its Oscar nods I just bought and I'm glad I did. The story exposes a glimpse of the reality of those dealing with mental health issues. Any person can watch this movie and enjoy it.
0307730697|5.0|I can't say anything that hasn't already been said. Amazing read, will change the way you look at things and how you treat others. The pages flew by, and at times, it still felt at times Adam was right there with us. The Mr. Blehm wrote it best at the end, by saying, he knew how the book was going to end, but he wish it didn't. This book isn't just a book about the military. I encourage anyone who is having trouble with drugs/alcohol, motivation, depression, etc. to read this book.<br /><br />The only thing I did not enjoy was all of the talk of religion and God. But hey, this is a book about Adam, a true warrior, and if that is how he lived, I would be honored to hear his story.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|The author did a great job of making you feel involved with the story. His knowledge of the legal system was clear and helped make the story more real. Great suspense and twists!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|This movie delivered. Dicaprio was spot on as a southern plantation owner, Jamie Foxx played Django perfectly, hell bent on retrieving his wife. This movie was well worth it and I loved every minute. The over the top gore was awesome, and some of the fight scenes, although improbable, were completely spellbinding and left me wanting to cheer aloud for Django and the good doctor. Christopher Waltz was I impeccable in his role as the doctor, and the chemistry between him and Foxx really sold me on their characters. I believe this movie is an instant classic, and if you enjoy action movies, definitely check it out. Other than Kill Bill, I would say this is Tarantinos best work. I liked it better than Pulp Fiction even.
B00B1M8DAK|4.0|Cute movie and very entertaining. The giggles from the kids made this a good adventure. Goofy is always a good one for a fun story. Has just enough humor and adventure for the tween and younger.
0425252868|5.0|As I read this book, I was amazed at the author's ability to describe scenes told to him in interviews in such vivid detail. The story is quite unique, however, the organization of the story is where the genius of the author shines through. I have read many stories about WW2, but few have ever compared to the skill of this authors storytelling. Don't miss this one.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I had to excuse myself from the room  90% of the time I was reading this. Tina Fey is hilarious. Simple as that. I would recommend this book to anyone, but it would help if they knew a little background in SNL. Overall a fantastic read!!
B0052CK5PQ|4.0|I like Moran's modern view of what it is to be a feminist in these times.  Bra burning and man-hating are out and standing up for yourself, being honest and the right to chose are in.
B004GTLFNW|4.0|This is what I have been looking for<br /><br />A compact, balanced, graduated difficulty whole body strength training regime that does not require equipment and takes under 40 minutes per session.
B00785P2QC|5.0|good game. easy to follow and get started. some of the initial goals are hard to get the money for but other than that a good Sim game.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love bingo blitz it's a great game to play. It's fast and fun I enjoy playing it everyday and so do my children! :)
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|Django the D silent! Amazing movie enjoy the graphics was a little lag in the story line towards the end but never the less ended in a bang literally!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|The movie is appropriate for the age it says it is. it portrays the time period and the lives of the people durring this timeperiod well. I watched it and teared up. I LOVE THIS MOVIE SOOOOO MUCH!!!!!!!!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Starting watching this show recently and now I'm hooked. Great actors, plot and show! Can't wait to watch the next seasons.
0063120046|5.0|This was a book that my Mom wanted a copy of so I ordered it for her and had it sent directly to her.  She was very pleased so that is all that matters to me!  Price was reasonable and it shipped to her quickly.
B008MM9630|5.0|OMG best game ever! I love the little animals there so cute!!!!!!<br />I wish you do not have to pay but it is the best game in my whole life!
B0064MGU98|5.0|I started watching this show mid-season of season 3.  I am glad to be able to catch it from the beginning.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is by far the best game I have found for Kindle.  The graphics are great.<br />I hope there is more to come from this developer.  Well worth the 2 bucks.
B001S86J1C|4.0|What is the point of buying comedies on bluray?  I seriously have no idea.<br /><br />This looks just like the movie you know and love.  Sure there have been some quality improvements just by up-converting it to bluray, but whatever.  Perhaps if you don't own a widecreen version it might be worth it.  (Fish Called Wanda, btw, totally benefits from a wide-screen viewing if you've only seen  a full-screen version.)<br /><br />Biggest disappointment is definitely the omission of John Hughes commentary from the DVD.  Now I have to keep the DVD I intended to replace.
0374531269|3.0|Before I started reading this book, I was a little skeptical.  I thought it was going to be another boring documentary that I would have no interest in because I had to read it for a class. However, by the time I finished reading it, I couldn't believe how emotionally attached I was to A Long Way Gone. The book is told through Ishamel Beah's point of view.  Beah was a 12 year old boy that was forced to run away from his home when the Revolutionary United Front, or RUF, invaded his hometown and killed many of his friends and family members. In terms of globalization, the book shows how Beah was able to raise awareness of what was actually happening in Sierra Leone. Since he was a child soldier himself, he was able to attend a United Nations meeting in New York and speak of his experiences as a child soldier.  Reading this book gave me even a better perspective of what else is going on in this world. Sometimes I take certain things for granted and I complain about small things in my own life. But then after reading this book and reading about the kinds of things Beah had to go through for his childhood, it really makes me appreciate things and makes me a lot more grateful for my childhood. I think this is a great book for future class just to raise awareness that there are more serious things that are happening in the world and we have to realize that.
B006YC74E8|5.0|This photo editor has some features that I don't have on my PC editor. I like to crop pictures before emailing them to other people--and I like the oval shape in the crop tool.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I didn't think I'd enjoy it much, but it turned out to be a wonderful movie. I'm hoping the other books are made into movies, too.
B008Y5OW20|4.0|Jeff Lynne is a master of music and this album will show off his many styles of music talent. It is a far cry from his ELO days but a great album.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was into this book from page one.  The story was really interesting and kept my attention. I hated to have to put it down. I give it five stars.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|What could be better?!  All of life's moments analyses in terms of racing.  It made me think of zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance.. In better because seen through the eyes of a dog
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I would give this book a 20 rating.  This book describes in my opinion what life after death will be if you believe Jesus died for our sins.  God will take you in his arms and your struggles on earth will end.  That we are just on loan to our earthly bodies and the ones we love and when death comes our real life just begins.  I would recommend this book to everyone I know.  I am grateful that Dr. Alexander took time to share his experience.  God bless you.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|amazing cast, amazing story lines, we were glad there were 40 episodes, but that wasn't enough.  we enjoyed every minute!
B005PK57IK|5.0|Very good character development and many misleading story lines with excellent plot twists and just good acting from main characters to guests like Michael J,. Fox
B001NIAQ9I|1.0|Though we were excited to see \\"Funny Girl,\\" there was no picture, only sound!  I hope we can get our money back!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great story line this season.  Excellant cinamatography simple beautiful each episode!  The acting is emmy award winning! Can't wait to watch Season 3.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This product here is amazing! It lets me know the battery percent at a glance i have tried others and they are not really accurate but this one is accurate big time
1476734941|5.0|This is not so much a review as a commentary on the reviewers who said the book was not worth buying and gave the essential details of the diet. Not a single review that I read here said anything about how fasting puts cells in a protective mode or reduces IGF-1. I saw the program (it still can be viewed online...do the right search and you will find a site) and I would recommend both reading the book and watching the program. One thing the book did mention is a person named Nora and her experience with fasting and chemotherapy. If you do a search on \\"fasting and cancer treatment in humans a case series report\\" you will find report gives an indication that fasting reduces or eliminates many of the nasty side effects of chemotherapy and may even increase the effectiveness of chemotherapy. If you live to age 75 there is a one chance in three that you will get cancer so this information alone is worth the price of the book. Had I not read the book it is doubtful I would have found this out about fasting. It should also be noted - I'm not sure if the book says this -- but for humans protein intake should be kept to a minimum -- around 0.95 grams per kilogram of bodyweight in sedentary people to lower IGF-1.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Even though the &#34;Hunger game&#34; book series was written for teens<br />at least the first book was outstanding.  The movie took the heart<br />out of the book and gave us another shallow action adventure.<br />In defense of the movie makers it would have been very difficult to<br />make a movie that kept the heart of the book.
B002VHI8J0|5.0|The movie just left me confused, as much as I loved it, but the book is a work of genius.  The use of English in all its glory and adaptability is beautifully employed, additionally the story is totally compelling.  I would recommend this book to anyone who loves the English language and a totally intriguing story. A very good read.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game, the only down side is the coin payout is not great unless your in a higher end room.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|I had to buy this because the first cd they released from the movie did not include all the songs and this one does.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|At start, it had you wondering, every day normal life things. By the end, the character of everybody came out and you could very well say, this could happen to me.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I originally saw the stage play and was confused by it. I tried to read the book and I am still struggling to read it. I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!! I saw it three times in theaters and I just can't get enough of it. All of the actors did an amazing job...except for Russell Crowe. I usually like him in movies but he is definitely not a singer!
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|I've always loved  Boz Scaggs' voice and singing style, and he does great covers of classic old soul songs. I love his versions of jazz classics on his other CD's as well.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|this movie is hilarious!!! And all the actors are amazing singers. I knew a lot of them and had no idea they could sing. Rebel Wilson is hilarious in this
B000GOWNPU|4.0|Id have given it a five but I just could not get over Kevin Bacon being a bad guy. Otherwise it was great. Kevin is one of my favorite male stars.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Comes in handy for definitions its easy to use and would recommend it to everyone who is interested in proper pronunciation and meanings
1600595871|5.0|it is sublime.<br />again- i had taken it out from the library, but now, i use it all the time!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|My 75 year old mother and I both enjoyed this movie. It was total escapism and very fun and enjoyable. I highly recommend it.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|A very interesting read the more you read it you wanted to findthe happy ending  A very interesting book kept  interest
B005I4JG80|4.0|I'm expecting my first child and saw an interview with this author on the news. I decided to give this book a try. I enjoyed her writing style and the way she presents her observations, but doesn't preach about one right way to parent. This book provides great perspective on how American parenting has changed over the years; how our American attitudes towards parenting differ from those of the French; and how they are affecting our kids. I felt the take away from this book was to encourage parents not to adopt an entire new philosophy, but to simply use common sense. If you want to expand your perspective on balanced parenting, this book is definitely worth a read.
B00340I4KG|5.0|Action, some body count, Dominique Swain punked out, fun watching two actors playing the same double parts.  A 1999 classic.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|Very well written, should be required  reading by all US students and world leaders; the story of one of our ablest political leaders at a decisive moment for this young country.
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|Good story, lots of action. Typical Quentin Terrantino flic. Worth watching although not for children. There is to much violence and blood.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|very entertaining to read keeps you wanting to finish this book. I like a good story and this is that!
B003LSU0K8|1.0|I purchased two watches recently thinking I hit a jackpot. Since I know Casio Pro Trek's watches are expensive. This is not even a pro trek watch in the first place. If I can give it a zero star I would have. I feel so cheated. This is just a regular Casio watch. The product is okay, but not the one I'm after and the strap is very thin. Thinner than what they use in G-shocks. So please don't buy the product if you're looking for a Pro trek watch.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This is  good part 2 book that keeps you in suspense and guessing what will happen next. Can't wait to read part 3.
B003DTMUOE|5.0|Great book. This is the second time I rode the book. Every time I read it find more interesting details
B008KMHFJY|4.0|Pretty realistic, easily lost myself in the story. Couldn't wait to find out what happened next. Reflects some real life aspects without being too cheesy or overly dramatic.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I really have grown to like the characters and look forward to see what happens to them next. The author has a lot of imagination.
B001EBWING|5.0|Two of the best actors ever with a spectacular supporting cast. It is a timeless story, which will entertain and move you.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This series requires you to keep up with the characters and the story line, but he does it well.  Love the fantasy/reality.
B007ZSBQYE|4.0|this game is not bad once you go to the options and change the controls. i switched it to &quot;tilt&quot; &amp; found the game to be less frustrating that way. but it is confusing and takes a little while to get used to steering this way. the biggest drawback is how tired my arm gets, tilting my heavy-ish kindle fire every which way. but i finished three levels without too much frustration &amp; then stopped to write this review. this game probably won't stay on my device for more than a day or two, but i think it's not too bad for a FAOTD. better than a lot of games we get. i think 50 cents is an appropriate price for this. you just have to get used to the controls.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|very well written book with many characters that you have to keep up with.  Hated it when the book ended.
B00902S0IS|5.0|This is classic Sci-Fi, at it's best. By today's standards probably kind of silly, but you must take it, in it's context. It was made in the 1950's, when the young girls wore short skirts, just because (I don't know if they ever had any explanation as to why, they just did). And some of the dialogue is, well a bit stilted, but that was common during that period of time. Just overlook it. The ideas presented of an advanced race which climbed to the pinnacle of its existence and the wiped themselves over, is mysterious and chilling. I recommend this as a great sci-fi film, for it's period of time.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|After I read the Game of Thrones, I couldn't wait to read the next one, hoping it would be as good and it was!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|the only drawback is the hearts.  unless your friends play you'll never be able to get enough hearts to buy cool things
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I watched this on HBO and didn't like it much, The book is soooo much better!  I will be reading the next one in anticipation of what happens next.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|My daughter really enjoys this book. She described it as a very sad story but she loved reading it as part of her school required reading time.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|As a non-native English speaker, I had a terrible time getting into a rhythm with the book, but once I was able to finish the first chapter, I was hooked. Highly recommended.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I looove to play bingo. And bingo blitz is fun but has some issues. And whenever I would notify them of it they would just say they are looking into it.  They wouldn't refund me any bingo tokens, unless I purchased them. I haven't had to buy any in a while but I have purchased them in the past. There's another version of bingo that I play and anytime I would have a problem they would give me tokens by the hundreds. Because really, it doesn't cost them any money. Then they tell me to update, and ive asked twice where to update and both times they tell me the same thing and I tell them every time that it doesn't say update.<br />So like I said, I don't love it! But its still fun to play...
B0058YPLA2|5.0|I got this for my mom and she loved it!  It's a great series with a more adult take on fairy tales!
B004X2M3N8|5.0|This is the awesomest show on earth. I love the adventure the comedy and the complete madness. Anyone who likes those things I promise you just watch one episode and you'll be addicted too!!!
B000FBJF3M|3.0|This book is not exactly a page turner, but still an interesting read. If it was well researched, it does provide some insight as to what happened.<br />Perhaps my favorite reading material is fiction woven into historical events.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The book kept me nailed to the seat. I have never read a book in 2 days in my life.
B008476HBM|4.0|Great book, nice classic! But the first part was so terribly boring. Now I'm talking in Jane Austen language haha. But yeah, I read this book for a project and writing it on conflict, man vs self and man vs society. Might be hard, but I'll take the challenge
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The book kept me nailed to the seat. I have never read a book in 2 days in my life.
B007KZY1YY|1.0|After reading the forst quarter or so of the first book, I wished I had not wated money on the other two books.  If the first one was any indicator, this will be equally crap.
B005DI65L2|2.0|The author rambles for pages to tell what should take a few sentences.  Entire chapters feel like an introduction for the single paragraph of actual content.  Interesting topics such as canine body language are barely covered, while she spends pages trying to sound profound.<br /><br />A great disappointment.  I'm sorry I wasted my time trying to force myself to finish this book.<br /><br />A pity, as there are some kernels of interesting content (which, in my mind, justify the second star).  Perhaps the publisher will release an abridged version without the unreadable fluff.
B007KOYEOC|1.0|After reading the forst quarter or so of the first book, I wished I had not wated money on the other two books.  If the first one was any indicator, this will be equally crap.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|Fun and cute my daughter loves this game. Just wish this game would not freeze up half the time. But it was a free game
B005EGXTHG|5.0|My brother recommended these books after reading them when his 12 year old daughter got them.  He was hooked, I was hooked.  A fresh idea and a great story.  Well worth a read - teen to old.
1475255586|5.0|I love this book, is full of good ideas to teach in a fun way. Children learn happy and having fun. This book should be present in the shelf of a teacher. Do not miss the chance to have it. Good price for a great book.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|I bought this after my brother recommended it to me (the series had been given to his 12 year old daughter).  I personally think 12 is a little you to get the boof and it is a little violent, but it is well written, keeps you interested and would recommend it to anyone.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Good so far although still early to really say, recently been hooked on the tribez and have a feeling this may be just as addictive.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|bought all three on a whim after the hoo- haa on the tv.  What a waste of $30.  Mills and Boon S&M and not even realistic.  I mean, who really gets off on stuff like this.  Don't waste your $$$
B00ABXA1HI|4.0|I use this both on my phone and my tablet to access my laptop. The phone is a bit more difficult due to the tiny screen.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Living history, as the show unfolds our very own history opens before is exposing the ups and downs of a real time of life in England
B004FRX0MY|3.0|It's handy being able to purchase and stream music in the same application.  Interface could use some fine tuning though.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|Nelson DeMille captures both intense drama singularity in the same great book, plum island.  John Corey has easily become my favorite fictional character with his dry sarcastic wit, strong machismo, and brilliant detective work.  DeMille is an incredibly talented writer and story teller.
B000ICZD5M|3.0|It's okay. Nothing memorable but not without entertainment value. I had seen it before in the eighties. I wanted to watch it again after having listened to the audio book.
B001XUJMZK|5.0|This movie is definitely worth a watch. You'll enjoy the acting, drama, action, and even a history lesson in which everything in this movie is well done and I really enjoyed watching it Again and will continue to enjoy it years and years after the fact.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|It's a wonderful game for kids. I also play it when I have nothing to do so l can enjoy it to.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|A nice hidden gem to watch. If you like X-Files, you'll most like enjoy this one. Recommend to give it a chance.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I was a little skeptical when I first read the description of this book. There wasn't much to it, so I assumed it wouldn't be that good.  I relied on the reviews, however, and decided to give it a shot.  Wow, am I glad I did!  This was an exciting nail-biter almost from the very beginning. The only thing that turned me off a little about it is there's a good bit of swearing that didn't seem to be totally necessary.  I've never heard astronauts talk that way, but I guess, in hindsight their just like the rest of us.  This was a great, quick, enjoyable read.  Thanks for the exciting ride, Mr. Weir.<br /><br />Cheers!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Could not put this book down - well done. Excellent , well thought out story from start to finish. Ending was perfect. Highly recommend.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Luv it a lot..easy to play on screen.great score keeping.Great set up.play it a lot.love it .love it. Love it.
B0081SRJSY|5.0|This game is very fun, but I had to go to a website and check out the scoring rules, having never played it before. I can't imagine playing the board game because it is so handy having the computer keep score. Glad I made this purchase.
B0015DWLD0|5.0|I have been meaning to read this book for years but I've been too busy or I keep on forgetting. I finally got it and I love it. I couldn't put the book down. If you're into novels that is reflective of societal structures and hierarchies, this one if perfect for you.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Saw the play with my family many times.  The movie helps bring the story clearer.  Very well done. LOVE IT!
B007N5YIUS|4.0|Fun game to have on my Kindle Fire.  I use it when I need to pass time waiting on someone.  I also use it as a reward for free time for children.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|I  loved the way Harry Bosch's determination wouldn't let him stop until he solved the murder of his mother (which happened many years in his past).  It showed his resolve to bring this situation to a conclusion he knew in his heart to be the truth but never proven.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Elementary Season 1 has a captivating story line. Plus the acting is very good. I enjoy the interplay between Sherlock Holmes and Watson. It's full of investigation, teaching and a hidden romance between to the 2 main characters. I especially like the acting roles of the NYPD captain and main detective. Excellent compliment to the overall story. I look forward to Season 2.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|I enjoyed this.  Not like the show but in a good way different.  It needs a deeper set of characters but that is my only down check.
B009VIZDLI|3.0|This is an enjoyable read if you can suspend your disbelief. Don't judge the book by the first few pages. Go with the flow and you'll enjoy the ride.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|It's Okay<br />This book was not as interesting as I thought it should have been. I was able to put it down and stop reading. Not such a page turner as I expected.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love it very much intriguing,I'm glad my cousin recommended to me !!! Now I have read the rest .
B004SIP9E2|5.0|Had some friends over for pizza and we enjoyed the movie. Extremely stupid but that was exactly what I expected.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Great game but has a little too many ads for me. Kinda of hard to put it down sometimes, when you working on the 3 stars.
0374531269|5.0|25 Year old Ismael Beah recounts his life as a 12 year old child soldier in Sierra Leone.  You follow his journey as he first leaves his village on the run, and see how as time passes in such a horrible condition, a child can be swayed and molded into a person of evil killing, raping, destroying, and using drugs at an age where in other countries he should be having recess and enjoying his youth and childhood.  It has only been introduced to the western world recently with the Invisible Children movement and more information on the LRA and leader Kony reminding us that our ignorant western veil keeps hidden one of the most violent and disgustingly inhumane issues going on in our world.  It makes you wonder why is that our country can intervene in foreign issues where there is something to gain such as oil or land, but will not intervene in saving childrens lives.  I would definitely recommend this book to people of all ages whether young or old to remind them how lucky we are to be where we are at, as well as again to open their eyes to the world around them showing that although globalization is taking place all over the world, some countries who try to follow in the footsteps of technological advancement are still being pulled back by genocide.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Great game but has a little too many ads for me. Kinda of hard to put it down sometimes, when you working on the 3 stars.
B001NHNG64|5.0|I thought it was fairly believable and exciting. A real page turner at the end. Thought the ending was appropriate.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Great game but has a little too many ads for me. Kinda of hard to put it down sometimes, when you working on the 3 stars.
B008476HBM|5.0|I admit it! I am smitten by Darcy and have been since I was 13 years old. I return to him and Lizzy at least once a year, usually at a low point in my life when I am in dire need of simple pleasures. A re-read of Pride and Prejudice is guaranteed to revive my spirits and firmly knock me out of any thoughts of wallowing in self-pity or doom and gloom.  So what a treat it was to get this e-book for absolutely nothing!<br /><br />You cannot read Jane Austen's novels without being struck by just how skilful she was at deploying the English language. That is why I can continuously go back to her books with no risk of boredom. I find myself completely caught up in the sheer brilliance of her work.<br /><br />But, as I openly admitted before, I really go back time and again to get my annual Darcy fix. Why do I love Darcy?:<br /><br />1. He's obscenely rich<br />2. He's good looking<br />3. He's intelligent<br />4. He is brooding and arrogant - the original \\"bad boy\\" of literature<br />5. He is smitten by Lizzy who is clever, vibrant and atypical of what men desired in her era<br />6. He loves his sister<br />7. He realizes the error of his ways and consciously embarks on a self-improvement project for Lizzy - Let's face it, all women believe that they are capable of changing their man for the better (well, in our opinion anyway)<br />8. He is not afraid to take drastic action against injustice<br /><br />These characteristics are fairly standard for the male heroes in romance novels, but there are few of these heroes are able to compare favourably with Darcy. So I will probably continue to be smitten by him for the foreseeable future, and that's fine, because it really is no hardship to read Austen's masterpiece every year.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Great game but has a little too many ads for me. Kinda of hard to put it down sometimes, when you working on the 3 stars.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|I really like this game. I am allowed to get the real game tomorrow. :)  i i made like, 5 worlds because the stupid time only gives you 15 minutes. And its really easy to build in creative mode. This game is super fun ! :D
1455526959|2.0|I had lost interest in Harry Bosch a while back because his stories are so negative. He can't maintain good relations with anybody - not his fellow policemen, his wife, his girl friends, etc. (At least that's what I take away from these stories.) I like a hero that seems like a decent guy. He doesn't. But I decided to give him another try.<br /><br />Now he has custody of his daughter, at least temporarily. What does he do? He alienates her buy reading her private diary. This proves to her that he does not trust her. He fails Parenting 101. This should be no surprise since he is a cop. He trusts no one. I read a lot of cop stories. Most show cops can get along well with their fellow cops and can be good family people as we know they can.<br /><br />I did not finish the book.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|I'm a Scandinavia-phile, and love this.  Very much the dark and creepy side of Vikings, but probably pretty close to truth.  Gorgeous production, incredible casting.  Can't wait for tonight's episode...!
B008Y73940|5.0|Good movie! Actors all good and good twist. Matthew McConaughey does his usual good job of acting, I like his movies!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is just kike temple run they are both very cool games but they need updates<br /> I like this
B001XV3LSS|4.0|This was still a good movie, even though its older. Especially if you enjoy the idea that we aren't alone out there.  It's a good way to pass an afternoon.
B000083E79|5.0|I always liked the music Cher put out.  Of course I'm also partial to Dolly Parton.  I listen to SeriusXM 60's.
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|I didn't realize that this was the first part of a trilogy, wish there had been a little more to it.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|I like the movie.  When I am in my shop I can listen to the songs.  I like Cher's music.
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|Continues with the excellent production and storyline but It was advertised as available on PRIME!!!<br />We have to pay to watch it.
B002ZG976U|5.0|I like this movie.  I have watched it quite a few times since I received it.  It arrived faster than expected and in excellent condition.
0812469674|5.0|This is such a powerful message for little girls.  It is a &#34;hardback&#34; but not a very high quality binding.  Artwork is fun.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|All his books are great you just want ot keep reading instead of doing what you should be doing...LOL...just but them you'll love all of his work
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This game is a hit with my family! We all love playing it (my kids go so far as to argue over who gets to play first!), and have nothing but good things to say about Angry Birds Star Wars and Rovio. Would recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of Angry Birds and/or Star Wars!!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|The book read well; you were left not wanting to put it down.  I enjoyed the character interaction.  I enjoyed the read.
B008Z9YGEE|3.0|If it wasn't for the actors this would just be another one star rating.  Just an old worn out theme and a rehash of by gone shows.....that should be left by gone!
B000V5Y1SQ|4.0|Good story. Enjoyable for Science fiction  buffs. Took one star away because of video quality. It is not in HD!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Honestly this was my first Autobiography but I loved it.  Chris really explained what he and his teams did and the emotions you feel right with him. I cried (a lot) and laughed with this book, I found it well written, and I do recommend it.
B00CHILW64|4.0|This is more painful to watch than I imagined.  The mayhem and suffering makes for a &#34;downer&#34; of a movie.  The excitement of the special effects of the tsunami makes an amazing opening.  My 13 year old son couldn't watch the movie after the wave hit because of the wounds and gashes.  Lots of blood covers most of the characters during the whole movie.  Some images of dead bodies.  Spoiler alert:  the family is reunited at the end which helps offset the pain and suffering of the remainder of the movie.  Not for kids who are sensitive about blood and injuries.  A must watch for adults; real life, real pain...could you handle it?
B00571F26Y|5.0|If you have a wheat belly or you care about someone that does this is a book that you will find helpful. If you want to<br />improve your health and have a better understanding of how the foods that we eat can influence our health this book is a must read. It will not answer every question but, you will learn a lot and the science is there. While it is well written it<br />may be a little too in depth in some areas. In that case read as much as you want and move on. I will never look at wheat in quite the same way.
B001DM1VXE|4.0|Short review this time:<br /><br />The way Pi was filmed takes you into the mind of the protagonist.  Visually gritty, the black and white can shock you at times and really creates some great emotional ties into the story.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys story over visual effects.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|The kind of movie you don't mind paying the large prices for. not a lot of plot but a lot of fun Would see a lot more.
B0032KLAKE|4.0|Good movie, with a shocking little twist.  Great acting with several top notch actors aside from Richard Gere. Too bad the video quality was poor.  The picture kept freezing and the sound kept going in and out.  Picture would go black and then the video would reload.  Annoying!
B00A77II0U|4.0|This was a fun game with a fairly good plot.The details are a bit mixed up and cloudy.The sister shows up in rags as if she has lived there like a feral animal for 25 years,but you read in the epilog she just sort of wandered off and grew up elsewhere.So why is she standing there looking like a ragged homeless waif?The dummy in the cage was electric and had a battery that was still charged after several decades? Wow! I didnt like the way it transitioned between scenes. If you tap on a close up nothing happens for a while and you think &quot;is it frozen?&quot; Then all the sudden youre there. But youve already tapped again and so it opens and closes immediately.It was a little annoying but all in all the game was entertaining.
B0095P33IW|5.0|What an awesome movie!! And great streaming quality, it loaded very quickly and there were no interruptions, well, except for the kids :)
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Usually when I read a book first, I don't like the movie very much, but not true with this one.
B0079TQHDO|3.0|predictable would be a kind word, at times I felt I was reading a Harry potter book and not a drama/thriller, sorry just didn't cut it for me
B005MLOOJA|5.0|This series is addictive! You can't  wait to see what is going to happen in the next episode....very enjoyable, highly recommend
B00AH8FTT2|2.0|started to get into it, giving the &#34;series&#34; one more shot, but to finish up with a soap opera finale is and was disappointing, sorry turned off for good now
B008Y6SLL2|4.0|Excellent movie about the buying & selling of the market ! and the things that could happen. pretty good movie.. I liked it.
B00A31UXLW|4.0|as usual Harry delivers, excellent read - this is gauged by my internal indicator, can I put it down, yes or no
B000O78KW4|5.0|from Die Hard series i liked Die Hard 1 and Die Hard with a Vengeance, they have one story with 2 brothers.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|I loved this show.  I don't understand why they ever cancelled this after the first season.  For those who decide to watch, there is no ending.  The ratings were high for this show, even won a few awards but they cancelled anyway.
B008RTE08E|5.0|The Beatles: Magical Mystery Tour was really magical and mystery, love the movie and the songs, and also the special features.
