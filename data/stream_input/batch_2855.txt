B008KP6ENE|5.0|Awesome. Thought it might be one of those games where you walk around wherever you want playing with friends online. But it turned out to be BETTER. You go running around jumping on enemies to defeat them, and also defeating bosses. Going through the HARD part of the level and chapters is difficult,but I can get through it. I`m  on the last chapter second level so far. Awesome game if you ask me. There is no blood or bad language. Great for kids seven and older. Hope you enjoyed this review.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Your service is an inspiration and I truly thank you for your sacrifice and the sacrifice of all those who fight on our behalf. God bless
B001GJ3BR8|4.0|This wasn't my favorite movie, but I was very satisfied with how Amazon allowed me to rent it instead of buy it, and that Amazon allowed me to pick between the director's cut and the theatrical version. All the choices I needed to enjoy the product were given to me.
0521682010|4.0|It is very good and quite useful. I cannot make a comparison, since it is the first book of its kind I have bought. The information is well thought out and applicable
B0062QRTKA|3.0|I played it on my phone and did ok for the first few levels. Before long I just couldn't see what I was doing or click accurately enough to hit what I wanted to.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Wish Mr. King would keep his liberal views and dislike for Texas out of his writing!  This would have been a 5 star review otherwise.
B00CDY6HW6|5.0|I loved Lemmings growing up and have been looking for the original or something like it, this is pretty close. The levels are semi straightforward but you still have to make a plan to finish them. The controls are easy and even the music is fun.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is a good time consumer. Makes you use your brain, and can be frustrating at times, it's good for what it is.
B0058VW36U|4.0|I enjoy this game. The levels are a good mix of thought, planning, timing, and luck. Some levels do take some trial and error but I still enjoy it.
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|It's cute movie if you remember and have played a lot of old video games.  Brings back good old memories.
B000WC8C1A|5.0|My granddaughter and I have watched Hairspray over and over again!!! We love the singing and dancing performed by the teens!
0763644765|5.0|Not necessarily a fun topic, but this book makes a lighthearted approach.  It's fun, and she actually enjoys the book.  It increased her awareness of the potty, and her interest level.  Not potty training per say, but a useful tool.
B001NKI60W|5.0|My granddaughter and I just love Mamma Mia and have watched it over and over again!!!  We sing along and enjoy the antics and personalities of the cast!!!!!!
B005R32L66|4.0|Great way for loved one's to correspond. We kept our grandson while his mom went to close up their apartmemt. Dad had just been deployed. When my grandson saw his mom on skype, he laughed and tried to kiss her face. It was good for all of us to see her and talk, but for the baby, 7 months old, it was great. She also skyped her husband when he was in Afghanistan  last year and it helped her to know he was ok. Seeing your loved ones helps when you cannot be together. I highly recommend Skype.
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|This Item has been shipped up to Mexico, first of all is AMAZING my top feature is the Sleep monitor because I can really measure how much I really rest, PLUS can be connected for free (DO NOT UPGRADE TO LIVE UNLESS YOU ARE A PRO) to RUN KEEPER and MyFitnessPal IOS APPS (I do not have Android).<br /><br />So if you are looking for really BANG for you MONEY this is the only and unique ONE! Go for it pal.<br /><br />Regards, from Mexico.
1611761565|5.0|I am one who is angered by those who do not appreciate the effort and sacrifice our Seals and Special Forces go through to protect our country and support other countries around the world. The bad press that Mark Owen received from writing this book was unwarranted and politically driven. He could have not been more discrete when detailing the specifics, not giving away any secrets we did not already know. Listen to those who portray events first hand, not from those who's agenda is opposing and politically motivated. I was at the edge of my seat and felt I was right there with the brave men.
B007SGM084|5.0|I am a mother of two and have been with my husband for 15 years.  We were childhood sweethearts.  In the entire 15 years I have never experienced anything like in these books.  I have never been the one for reading but my mom told me that I should read them and I did.  Now I have found myself reading each book twice just because it is so great.  I can't wait to see the movie. If is anything like the books, then it will be the best selling movie of all time
B0090KZDSK|5.0|Great read! Disappointing ending!! Please don't take so long to write the next one! Can't wait another year  and a half
B00DLKXF3A|3.0|Songs are pretty generic. I'd say their weakest release. It isn't horrible, just not really memorable. Synyster Gates does shred as usual, and honestly he saves the album for me.
0307352153|5.0|Such an interesting book that really shows the good side of introverts and the value they can have while questioning many of the ways society is currently trending
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|that much emotion felt when listening to an instrumental X2 joins Where Dreams Go To Die great song that makes you fly, excellent queensryche album, but I particularly like this version with Todd La Torre in the voice, the touch that gives had lost in previous albums simply as a great record of excellent band. Recommended 100%
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This was an enjoyable book to read, couldn't wait to get back to it every time I had to put it down.  Ending surprised me a bit and should have seen it coming.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome. I play it all the time and if your a minecraft lover this is a need. but there is things I wish first of updates. the world's need to be bigger although they are big enough to have fun. they also need the nether and end but  im Not to worried about that. they need Redstone one thing that makes minecraft fun is red stone. they need transportation. and the need servers and villages other than that this is the best.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Love this application, remind me one of the most exiting Arcai I play long time ago. And is also free thanks to prime
B008KYOCA2|3.0|This app seems to be useful and very simple. There is a little bit of confusion when first using the app, there is not a tutorial mode, just a sample entry which you are instructed to delete. The calendar seems to function well so far, I don't like how you cannot repeat anniversaries on the actual date (I put in my bro's b-day for this year and when I choose to repeat yearly, it puts the b-day one day earlier next year), you cannot set bi-monthly occurrences either. Other than those two gripes, and the fact that the calendar squishes everything into a tiny little square when focusing on the month as a whole, I feel like this could be a fairly functional/simple calendar tool. And hey, you can't really complain too much for a Free App :)
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|A7X is going for a more classic approach in Hail to the King, and I like it.  The drums aren't as heavy (RIP Rev), and the guitars have a 'groovier' feel while still maintaining their intricacies, but it's still good music from a great band.  This will definitely be on repeat for a while in my car.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Love this game. Its a simple but fun and addicting game. I'm not sure how long I'll enjoy it before I get bored but for now it's awesome.
B000HSKUBE|5.0|Just about as good as the original from the &#34;90's.<br />Wonderful acting.<br />Always love when the characters speak to the audience.
0764141201|5.0|That's a good book!!! if you really want to know more vocabulary, You must buy this book.<br />It has a few typos, but that's not a big deal.
B00BDAP66E|4.0|I have a business page and hate always going through all of the other stuff just to check on it.  I like this app because I don't have to.  The only complaint I have is that I can't see who liked the page if I don't catch it immediately.  With business that's important.  Online there is a list that you can access easier.
B004JHY80I|5.0|The suspense set a pace with and remarkable unfolding ending. Ms Waters is administering a lethal dose of a good satisfying story. I would have preferred an additional chapter at the end, but alas the Lady has done her job.<br />We linger in a addiction for another story.
B0067R0APK|4.0|Great weather app, tried others and found this one to be the most informative. Got a Kindle fire hd as a gift and used my Amazon coins to purchase and rid myself of the ads.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Its a really fun game and is getting better but the updates take a LONG time to come and we barley get anything please make the updates faster and make them have more stuff in them and it is still a good game
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I recommend it to everybody who likes to invent unique interesting machinery And to people who have quite interesting creative ideas.
B005RJ6DUK|5.0|This was a coming of age movie for me while I was growing up and I still watch it on a daily basis.  Great performances, great movie (from a great screen play)....all around great!
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I liked this tight, compact story with all of Gaiman's unique way of making even the most mundane things seem magical...or sinister.  My only complaint is that it felt a little unbalanced in terms of gender roles. The only adult males are either dead or powerless slaves to their carnal drives. One line even references such. But this is not the focus of the book--it is more about that journey from childhood to adulthood; what is lost along the way, what (if anything) is gained.<br /><br />Certainly not a book I'll be reading to my children, but I definitely enjoyed it as much as Gaiman's other works.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|A great App for anyone to have. Easy to use and install for anyone. Great to use as a standalone clock in the room.
B00AEBB9SM|5.0|One of my favorite movies is The Truman Show. In the film , the protagonist Truman Burbank is one of the most famous people  in the world, yet, he has absolutely no knowledge of it.  Beginning at birth, his whole life has been broadcast on TV .<br /> He lives in a town which is inside a gigantic dome replete with an ersatz  beach , ocean and  day and night sky.<br /> Truman becomes  smitten with a woman who also likes him. She attempts to tell him the truth of the situation , but is whisked away by a man claiming to be her father. The father character tells Truman that she is crazy but Truman's incredulity of his world becomes more and more suspect with the odd observances  seen amongst the actors and the set in the ersatz town. . He eventually tells his best friend that there is a conspiracy going on with him as the target ,and that he , in fact ,is the center of it all . His friend  said the world is a pretty big place to be the center of it all and that if there was a conspiracy  then he  would have to be a part of it and then he lied and told him that wasn't true. .Truman eventually  finds out that  his mother and father and wife are in on it. His ignorance is bliss mindset only holds out for so long . He discovers that he needs to escape to  what lies beyond the confines of the small town  , and also to find  his true love who tried to tell him truth.  The false creator man -god  Christos  even tried  to kill Truman as he attempted to make an escape  on the artificial high seas with a simulated storm .  Truman shouts out to whoever was in charge, \\" Is that the best that you got?!\\"  Before Truman  leaves in the door in the sky he asked his captor , \\"Was any of it real?\\". The director said, \\"You were real , Truman\\". Truman exit's the false  world with a big smile,  and his trade mark salutation, \\" Good Morning, and if I don't see you, good afternoon , good evening and good night\\".<br /> The story can be seen as a Gnostic myth. The inferior god called a demiurge in Gnosticism is the character  Christos who is the director and creator of the false world . The Archons or his trickster helpers are Christos crew and everybody in his life , including his mother ,father ,wife, and best friend  who keep the conspiracy alive . The exceptions are  the  lady actor , Sylvia, and a few others who sneak on the set who try to tell him of the false world. Sylvia  exemplifies wisdom in the mythos of the goddess Sophia in Gnosticism. She is the fallen one who is also the redeemer. When Truman finally leaves the false infantile world  of the dome he enters into his more mature true self of the world of the  real.<br /> The Truman Show demonstrates one of the greatest conspiracy against a single human being since the dawn of cinema. The amazing part of it is  that he is able to walk away from with it a big smile on his face.
B00ENYCQX8|3.0|After reading the blurb on this app, I thought it would do all of the things my iPhone/ipad wouldn't do with books & book files. Nope. All I could get it to do was open books that I could already read. And it freezes & crashes every 30 sec.
B00DW39B2K|3.0|But - didn't make a whole lot of sense to me. 'Killing Season' is OK for killing time. Good stars.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I really enjoy and even look forward to playing bingo blitz. The keys and power ups add a little diversity to regular bingo. If you log in on a daily basis you can get even more surprises.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I enjoyed this book more than the last two in the series. It was a good plot with an easy flow. All ends tied up nicely.
0060523794|5.0|It is the confirmation about how behavioral changes could change an entire organization. Excellent book to understand why, when, and how change has to be implemented, inspected, reinforced. A really inspiring success story.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|The plot was &#34;meh&#34;, a little predictable. I am a James Franco fan but he looked high and acted a little lost through most of this film. I enjoyed the characters and most of the storyline but it is very visually appealing and beautifully filmed.
B001P4ESGC|4.0|If you enjoyed Season One you won't be disappointed by Season Two.  What I liked most about this season is how the twists/turns were handled by the writers.  When you think you have someTHING or someONE figured out you soon learn you don't.  My only issue with Season Two and all the misdirection is the sheer volume of it all.  There are a LOT of people involved with lots of agendas and it can start to wear you out.<br /><br />Props to the writers who took all of these threads and wove them into a fine tapestry of intrigue, mystery and emotion.  Patty Hewes' character is consistent which is needed and Ellen Parsons' character arc build slowly to a wonderful finish.
B005WYFLNU|5.0|fun for the girls and kept them very busy nice to see them playing to gether happy happy happy happy
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I was just looking for something to play while passing time and now my wife and I are addicted to this damned game. Five stars for fun and addictive play.
B000AY74OG|5.0|came on time kids enjoyed it I enjoyed the quiet not much else to say about a movie. these reviews should not be word countd
B004UID2LC|1.0|Does nothing but crash and other programs won't work without it so I downloaded for that reason only.  I have uninstalled and tried reinstall but it still crashes.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|it's an addition to my son's vast movie library. I don't watch them but he enjoys them that's all that matters
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Keeps you busy.  Good graphics and memories of the old defender series.  I'll keep playing it until I get bored.
B00006JDU9|5.0|This is a great movie.  I have now a complete collection again.  That was missing and I watched the whole movie from start to finish again and enjoyed it.  Seller got it before the due date and in very very good condition.
B001CDD84Y|5.0|The type of movie that you don't mind seeing more than once because the idea behind it is so unique.  It totally leaves you thinking about what you would do and where you would go if you had the same ability.  Very entertaining!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've tried most of the Android keyboards out there and this one is by far the best.  Accept no substitute.
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|Would've liked to have seen a little more on the others (numbers 1 through 3) before getting to Number Four and his story.  Nice mix of Sci-Fi and drama, but you end up wishing there was a little more story to who he was, who his people were, and their connection with the Earth.  But, I recommend seeing the movie.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I love it! I am a heavy email user for work and find this is one of the best keyboards i found for 5&#34; and smaller screens.  Adjustable key sizes are great for big thumbs!
B00CEK9OTM|4.0|This game was attempted on [[ASIN:B007M50PTM Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (10.1-Inch, Wi-Fi)]] and also on [[ASIN:B00E0EY7Z6 ASUS MeMOPad HD 7-Inch 16 GB Tablet ]] and I am pleased to report that it works perfectly using the Accelerometer sensor for tilt controls.<br /><br />The game-play is to navigate the ball through the maze presented in each level and onto the hole which is maze end for the level. You control the ball using tilt controls of your Android device. The graphics are good and I can see myself wasting hours tilting my tablet trying to navigate the ball thru' the maze. There are some stars one needs to collect to get a perfect score on each level but it is not easy as it seems. There is good replay value as you can go back and perfect your moves and earn all stars.<br /><br />All-in-all a good maze game by using tilt controls. I am rating it 4 stars.
1416550550|5.0|This is the first Kate Morton novel I have read.  The book was passed all around in my office and when it was my turn, I hesitated due to the length, but OH MY! What a fabulous read!!  Really enjoyed it.  I must admit, I usually like to read in the evenings with a nice glass of wine.  Well, NOT with this book!  I really had to focus but so loved it.  I have just ordered The Secret Keeper and am really anxious to start it!!
B00CXVX1OQ|3.0|Monkey Boxing? who would have thought about that? I must say Kudos to developer for creating those funny characters on the screen. I love the slow motion and cartoons. The game itself starts well and graphics and sounds are well presented. But after playing couple of levels I found that it was way too repetitive. The opponent's moves are pretty much the same every-time and I could easily anticipate every move and win the levels.<br /><br />Currently, There are various options one can try to make your monkey character have extra speed, stamina and what not in a campaign style progress into levels but the actual game-play keeps repeating same every single time. Just keep punching and blocking. Soon the game looses it's charm because of this repetitiveness. IMHO this could be improved by making the AI little bit more unpredictable or make him move around more than normal or add various other controls to make it more interesting.<br /><br />I am keeping this in Amazon Cloud for an update and will attempt it again in the future. Thanks to developer for making this game free for the day. I am rating this with 3 stars!<br /><br />Thanks!
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Such an enjoyable movie. The characters feel familiar but updated. I think they did an awesome job with this. :)
B009AY04A8|2.0|The game has too much talking and blah blah. If that was not the case I would have rated it with 3 stars at the best. It is a 'OKAY' game otherwise except for touchy controls. The only thing nice about this game is that there is a decent enough story-line to keep you engaged. However, It is frustrating to play the game as even 'pinch zoom' is considered as tapping! After playing for couple of hours I uninstalled it. Sorry at this current state of the game I cannot rate it more than 2 stars!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Thank you for having on prime! Great series and Prime lets me catch up on this great series. Acting and sorry are fantastic!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|A wonderful game that entertains easily and always keeps the player coming back for more with each challenge and obstacle that comes about
B0054JZC6E|1.0|This one downloaded but wouldn't open.  Bummer.... It looked like a great time waster.  6 more words required to count.
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|This is a great release from A7X. Many are upset over losing their metalcore drumming and screaming etc... however, if you listen to this release it is more of a mature sound, and done the way other classic metal bands and albums were done in the past. Mainly like Maiden, but also Metallica, Megadeth, AC/DC, Guns, Queensryche etc... you can hear elements throughout that equal the approach of these bands.<br /><br />The sound is hard punching drums with a more methodical wall of sound. Which is a more powerful presentation for the band and compliments Shadows better, without the high pitched squeeling guitars all the time, you actually have more of a groove throughout and a more dynamic sound.
0375850864|5.0|When You Reach Me won just about every award given to middle grade and young adult novels and you could hear the enthusiastic cheering of 6th-8th graders from across the nation. It truly has one of the most original plots in years, yet it is also closely connected to A Wrinkle In Time. Can't tell you how - that would ruin everything, but insightful readers will have it figured out before the nail biting crisis and climax. This novel is in a new genre being called magical realism. It is mostly the story of a young girl trying to adjust to the changes in her social life, but has a crucial fantastical element as well. A perfect choice for reluctant readers - boys love it, too. Reading A Wrinkle In Time will deepen the experience, but is not necessary to enjoy the story.
0385345054|5.0|This is a really amazing book and a wonderful resource for crafters of any experience level with paper flowers.  The authors provide endless inspiration for both creating flowers and ways to use your creations.  The book is split up into several sections, including pictures of completed flowers for pure inspiration, a detailed how-to section with lots of instructions and tips on general techniques and materials, step-by-step instructions on how to make flowers featured in the earlier chapter, and then the largest collection of templates I've ever seen.  Not only do the authors tell you how to make the flowers in the book, they also encourage you to mix and match templates and create your own to form entirely new flowers.  While the flowers in this book are not the typical life-like recreations of real flowers found in other books, many of the designs can be altered to create realistic and beautiful flowers that can be mixed in with traditional crepe or tissue roses, daisies, and the like in any bouquet, arrangement, or favor.  There are also a number of fun, whimsical designs that seem very fitting for more casual purposes.<br /><br />I am working on creating paper flowers for my wedding next summer, and am excited to include a number of flowers and ideas from this book.  The images included are just gorgeous and the instructions are very detailed, even rated for difficulty so that users can know what to expect when starting a project.  Honestly, the resources listing in the back of the book alone is invaluable for someone who has been trying to track down all the various online stores for different kinds of crepe paper, tissue, flower stamens, floral tape, decorative scissors, etc.  I would highly recommend this book for anyone interested in crepe-paper flower making.  Especially if used in conjunction with a book like \\"How to Make 100 Paper Flowers\\" by Maria Noble, you'll learn everything you need and never run out of ideas and projects!
B0000VCZKM|5.0|Think this is should be standard for your child's library of entertainment.  Very well done and such a good story.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|I first saw &#34;Contact&#34; many years ago and revisit it often. It is well written and well executed and the dialog is intelligent. What draws me back again and again is a portrayal of the Universe that can satisfy viewers who are religiously oriented as well as those who are not. The benign view of older and more evolved civilizations along with a theory of orderly growth are very attractive, and yes, reassuring in our fraught world. Just a smart, old-fashioned and entertaining movie.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|Recommend this adapter . Best way to connect Ethernet cable to high speed Thunderbolt port on MacBook Pro. Much faster than WiFi.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This is by far the best temple run game made. It has excellent graphics, game play and is immensely fun to play!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|As the mother of a soldier, this book captivated me with the undaughting courage to face unbelievable obstacles of Adam Brown.  I was deeply touched and once again, my faith in my country and my God was renewed.  He was a true patriot, and had immense faith in his Lord and Savior.  It was --amazing and memorable.
B0045INOD8|1.0|Though it may have been a reality at that time during the occupation of our forces in those countries, I think that it was way out of bounds when showing our troops killing un armed civilians. I am glad I did not pay money for this flick.It was a great wast of time.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|Well written, very amusing, loved the home town references.<br />A guide for all on how Aspie's think and behave socially
B00130VLZ4|5.0|I bought this case for my Canon T3i since I just wanted a case for the camera and the kit lens attached. The quality is really great and the camera fits perfecltiy, so I`m highly satisfied! =)
B000JMKTLO|4.0|The toughness of the main character seems forced which makes it hard to like her, however she eventually grows on you and you come to accept her.
034580709X|3.0|This was a disappointment.  After reading almost all of his other cases, I always wondered about  the references to Australia.  But the motives ascribed to the killer in this story were pretty silly and the plot seemed very disjointed.
1577314808|5.0|I found this book and the precise moment I needed it.<br />I suffer from crazy panic and anxiety and was living in a loop of bad memories and should of's. This book helped me to learn to watch my looping mind and slow it down then eventually being able to turn it off. I am no where near enlightenment but I feel my journey has started with this book.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|Quite good...set in Ireland, the story of a man who has troubles putting his memories of the Catholic orphanage where he was raised, behind him.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Amazing show! Every episode gets better and better!! Can't wait for season 4! One of my favorite shows on tv!
B00004YRQA|4.0|Works like a charm would buy another one I have yet to have problems. Took a little while to get here, but other than that it works fine.
B000JWTX3Y|2.0|This is made with an adult theme, however, kids are drawn to it thinking it is the great young Lindsay they fell in love with. Teens found it boring and unbelievable, younger ones ages 10 to 12, didn't watch more than 5 minutes of it. I didn't last much longer. Boring!
B0064X7FVE|2.0|original worked well and was easy to read. new upgraded version has ads covering forecast information in landscape format. they use white lettering on backgrounds with white clouds..makes it impossible to read. looking up new locations and going from one to another is neither a smooth transition or easy for less technology savy users. I have used the weather channel app for nearly two years. I am uninstalling it today on my kindle fire as well as all other kindles in our family.
1616550414|4.0|Very cool if you are a true Zelda fan. It comes with the complete timeline explanation, a detailed description of the Skyward Sword story and some pretty cool artwork. All in all, a very cool book to have.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I shared this with a teenage friend, who was moved by it.  For more recent generations, this is &#34;The Little Prince&#34;  or their &#34;Jonathan Livingston Seagull&#34; or even Castellanos' books.  This has brought up many ideas from personal legends and treasures to twin souls and the unity of all being.  My young friend particularly lived recognizing faith references from his own tradition before they were clarified by Coehlo.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|It's not really bad, but its not really good either, some of the cgi is pretty cool, particularly the people made of porcelain and there is some humor with the little monkey, but its pretty forgettable in comparison to the original wizard of oz.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|David Tennant is my favourite Dr Who. Great season with all the favourites making an appearance. need three more words.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|This movie will never go out of style.  Funny, entertaining, great for the whole family.  It is funny to watch my wife spot some of the adult innuendos that she missed when she was younger.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Fun for the kids. Driving around keeps them busy and so does feeding times. Let's them enjoy letting them go too.
B008FC4WA4|4.0|4 stars is unfair. I really enjoy the story but I have gotten back to it yet. It might be 5 stars...
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I love hidden object games . They are so much fun.  The more difficult they are the more fun I have...
B00985E3UG|4.0|I really did enjoy this book with the exception of the part about Dr. Bob Lin and his stint at Frito Lay Inc. I think the author should have done a little more digging regarding this individual and his impact on the work he did at Frito Lay in the Research Department!
034580709X|3.0|Published in 1997, The Bat was Jo Nesbo's first Harry Hole novel and it shows.<br /> Harry's in Australia, assigned to help the Sydney police find the killer of Inger Holter, a young and beautiful Norwegian woman.<br /> We're introduced to Harry's alcoholism, which he gamely tries to control, but succumbs to several binges when things don't go well.  We're also treated to many \\"down under\\" words by the local police who also seem to speak in frequent clich&eacute;s.  Who knew?<br /> I've read a number of Nesbo's Harry Hole novels and, in a rather perverse way, I'm glad I read this one.  I can see how Nesbo's plotting, writing craft and characterization has improved over the years and I'm now anxious to read the next one he publishes.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This was an excellent book and one that I read straight thru. I really enjoyed the insight into nutrition, paleontology,biology,kinesiology,anatomy, and the insight into the Copper Canyon and it's indigenous people. I was a runner (now walker) who suffered more than a few injuries from improper running shoes and technique. I have also struggled continuously throughout my adult life with my weight!  I have probably lost several hundred pounds only to gain it back due to binging. The simple diets of the Indios gave me yet another alternative to my regular struggle with foods high in sugar, fat, and salt. My favorite part of the book was the dissertation on why we are hairless and were really &#34;BORN TO RUN&#34;!
0062073486|4.0|The book came was in Great Condition when I got it.  My son was happy and we got a great deal.
B008MM9630|5.0|I love this game so much! It is very easy to play and you don't have to send tons of money on it. I love that you don't need the Wifi to play! It is just a great game and I  have not had any problems.
B001I9B9I4|5.0|Saw this movie on TV and had to purchase it.  Katie Holmes was delightful and did a beautiful job convincing  everone she was the President's daughter.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so much fun . You get to take care of a horse in the virtual world . It is like taking care of a real horse but easier.
0345529057|5.0|Cannot believe this was only 17$ ! I decided I wanted to read these books since all of the hype over them and the show. I pop onto amazon expecting a bill over 30$ at least. I am very surprised. Just received these books today. They are smaller than what I imagined from the picture, but that is not a bad thing! Still cannot believe what a great deal this is.
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|This album is great. Don't listen to the bad reviews its a good album get it right now. It starts off amazing with the first song. Has it ballads. agh
B00ANA27IU|5.0|I loved the movie so much that I absolutely needed to read this book an he sequels.<br /><br />Though several parts are differenf from the movie, I can not help but appreciate this book for the more complete storyline that brings out a more profound understanding of the movie and the motivations of the Monolith.<br /><br />It is too bad that the Movie did not reflect this Storyline which I felt was more interesting especially after the deactivation of Hal.<br /><br />In short, if you liked the movie, you'll love the book. (So true in many cases even if he reverse is rare.)
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This is a well written show.  I find it engaging and endearing.  I love that it is clean and wholesome.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I downloaded it a month ago and it looks like they did an upgrade  last week or so which makes the game WAY better!!! 100% recommended!! Fun and challenging!
B00E6Z0THE|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game and I keep playing it over and over again.  The graphics are great and the game is WONDERFUL.
0395389496|2.0|Ordered it new, and received it with a ripped cover along the spine.  Can't give it as a gift anymore.....will try to fix.  But shouldn't have to, when buying new.
B004SIP9VA|5.0|About ballroom dancing.  The plot leads to to believe that the romance will go a certain way, but it doesn't.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I never thought this book would be in my reading range and I thought that I would be bored. But I was wrong by a long shot. In fact, I learned a great lesson from this book. A very commonly, or the most common phrase use. August was just a mistreated, normal kid.<br /><br /> If I had to right my own precept, it would be from a point of view from my life:<br /><br />  Sure I may be a person who doesn't match, or is not popular, or I may never want to go with the crowd. I may get teased or pointed at. But I am on this earth to prove a point. To make a difference. So while you are reading this, be sure to:<br />  Always be yourself
B000AJIF4E|4.0|I bought these for a temporary stopgap pair of headphones, when I needed to have the cable repaired on the ER-4P canal-style earphones i use several hours a day (i listen while working).<br /><br />Well, the ER-4Ps are back & repaired, and I find they have a level of clarity & detail that the Sonys do not. So i'm surprised to read that the Sony is the industry standard for audio engineering.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure this is not because of the difference of headphone style (over-ear vs. in-ear), but is in fact the quality of the sound.
B00BHBBSZ2|4.0|very nice notepad . and I just wonder why is for free but it makes me even more happy . keep like this guys
B00A8ECU24|1.0|not even playable with latest update on kindle fire. crashes at startup every time. don't waste your money buying gems just to have an update crash your device.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Colorful, coins move at a good pace,cute prizes,and good coin boost.There is a surprise during the game when you get too many coins on the floor.Get the game to find out what happens.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I read everything I can by this author and he never disappoints.  Very suspenseful with great characters and interesting locations.  Very thought provoking topic as well.
1452000247|5.0|O'Brien has a picturesque style that helped me imagine each scene in Peter: A Darkened Fairytale cover-to-cover.  The Mausoleum (Chapter X) is a great example... you can almost feel the chilly marble and smell the mustiness.  Or hear the beetles crunch in Heriot's mouth.  The magic pulls you in:  At one point a character suggests squinting because it slows down Peter's vision enough to see ghosts and I caught myself looking away from the screen to try it myself.  O'Brien's writing makes you want to believe.<br /><br />Peter is a character you want to follow into each adventure because he is so naively curious and, at the same time, as whipsmart as any parent of a 10-year-old knows they can be.<br /><br />If Lewis Carroll lived in this century, Adventures in Wonderland would read something like this chaotic fantasy.  This is one talented writer.
1423113497|5.0|He started reading over the weekend and has already finished two of the three we ordered.  I will order the rest of the books.
B008JFUO0Y|4.0|As a big fan of the original series--Bruce Campbell rocked--I was somewhat excited to see a remake. Although the over acting of a Campbell type character, which also made the series awesome, wasn't as prevalent in this movie, the gore and action was. Thought this to be a very entertaining and exciting remake. Good job!
B000L9IUPM|5.0|This review is for the NON-Blue Ray version of this concert. The audio on this is excellent! The talent in this group is unbelievable. Glen Fry has a golden voice. Joe Walsh makes his guitar do things like he's 30 years younger than he is. Don Henley sounds great even while he's banging on the drums. Probably my favorite concert to watch.
B004QNN1UI|5.0|I love everything about Simply Red, the music, the lyrics and most of all Mick Hucknall's voice which is so distinctive, smooth and soothing. This CD/DVD is a great addition to my collection; wonderful!
B000ATQYT2|4.0|My DVD contains a 4:3 version and a 16:9 widescreen version. And as stated by other reviewers, the widescreen version has cut the song, When Love Has Gone, which seems to me a stupid thing to do. Other than that, the Muppet version of this Dickens' classic is well told and will make a great family movie to watch together year after year. The songs are great. Having Gonzo and Rizzo as narrators is a nice comic touch, and in general having the Muppets as characters has added a unique flavor to this classic. And Michael Caine is wonderful as Scrooge!! I recommend buying the version that has the cut song included. It truly does add to the scene.
B000GRTQSE|5.0|This is definitely a great addition to my music collection. I just wish there were more videos or DVD of live concerts from Bob Dylan available.
B00338QENI|5.0|This is A must read! This book sheds light on an incredible part of American history, leaving no stone unturned.
B002OQT928|5.0|Attention parents! This movie will entertain the whole family. Sequels are seldom better than the original, but this one had us all laughing! It was a great buy!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Watched this before going to see Red 2. Now I can't wait to see R-2. I love the &#34;old&#34; guys, not acting like kids but credible and still fun and sexy. The humorous undertones kept me laughing while enjoying the unpredictable sharp-shooting and tussle-antics. I recommend this for families with older teen who will appreciate the spy content as well as with grandma (me) and grandpa who remember these stars in a variety of roles.
B008JFLWLE|5.0|Awesome! Would like to see extra functions (lik trig, base conversion etc.)<br />Reverse Polish Notation would be cool as well.
0385523386|4.0|The book is a good read, recommend it.  I am not done with the book, but so far, so good.
B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|Into Darkness cleverly reaches into Star Trek's past -- the original series and the &#34;Wrath of Khan&#34; to create a compelling and entertaining story.
B009AY04A8|4.0|I like games by this developer. They are good for a few hours' entertainment. They look great on my Fire. I did not find any glitches as I played, but I do turn the timer off. I am looking forward to the second game.
B005EGXNLS|5.0|I read all six published Saxon Chronicles one after the other.  There is no one better at weaving history into a riveting saga.  I highly recommend reading all six books in succession.  I look forward to &#34;The Pagan Lord&#34; in January.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I just started running and I loved that book. Now when I run 10k I think of the taharuma and say to myself that it's supposed to be a piece of cake.
B009AY04A8|5.0|fun hidden object game with interesting storyline. just wish they'd find a way to let you move around without taking off points for &quot;random clicks.&quot;
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Looking forward to season 4. PBS really hit a winner with this series. I feel like making a contribution to PBS so they can continue this series.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game. you can make your own town. you can add houses anamuls You van even expand it. thank you.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This Game is Awesome But you should make a free version of getting skins on it and you should and enchantment tables
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Can't wait for Pitch Perfect II.  Was flipping channels when I stopped on the &#34;riff off&#34;.  Watched for a few minutes, and decided that it was worth watching.  The whole family loves and quotes this movie.
B00005RDR9|1.0|DVD does not play on DVD players  or computers made for the United States.  It only works on European DVD players.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|My daughter has watched the movie no less that 100 times.  Just wish there was more on the CD and in the movie.  Can't wait for Pitch Perfect II
B0097EWK3A|1.0|How in world do you start this game.  I find it very confusing. I would give it more stars if I could figure it out. I love these type of games but this one has me stumped.
B004HXIZVC|3.0|the app is cool i love it on ipod and computer but on kindle it works fine for a couple weeks and then it starts crashing like all the time. you dont even have to do anything just sitting with the app open for like 30 seconds and it crashes. if they fix that and allow mobile downloads it would be 5 stars all day
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|I love the game play it every day but I wish the full game was for free to because making the things and then never being able to play with the same world again if u use up all the time is lame and make me mad
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Keeps me entertained. Love the little minions &amp; sound effects. I have to force myself to stop playing, it's quite addictive.
140006922X|5.0|Saw author on a T.V. and I had to get the book! It is a must read. I have rated it a 5 star book.
B00BEPVAV8|1.0|This was not a very good game. I downloaded it for my 23 month old thinking it would be something fun and easy he could play after his  educational hour,  but it only frustrated him. Myself and my oldest son tried it and no matter what we did, it would drive directly into the water,  so I just uninstalled it and am now looking for something else he may like. Any suggestions?
158270208X|5.0|I am totally enjoying this book and practicing it's teachings. It is great for being a happier person. I have bought it for 2 other ppl.
B00CM9JKQM|4.0|By far, one of the best albums of the year! And this, coming from a casual Queensryche listener...After a couple of munths hearing it non stop, my ears got used to the poor and painful mastering job but that doesn't undermine the power of each and every song... only gripe? It's a little bit short, could've used a couple of more new songs (not counting the remakes from the deluxe)
B005K17RU0|5.0|Thus app meets every need! Easy to use and accurate. Great for private use or even the most seasoned traveler!
B009CF7GRY|3.0|The original is better, but Julianne Hough is far better looking than Lori Singer. I wasn't really happy that Ren was from Bahston instead of Chicago, and I could have done without the Southie Good Will Hunting accent. Overall, I'm not sorry I watched it, but I wouldn't watch it twice.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|where did the the shack in the country come from?  just happened on it?  and with the radio and music there? too confusing.  waste of Morgan Freeman's talents and the other actors too.  thought we would really see something when MF showed up, but no.  big waste of talent all around.  For pure escapism, okay but nothing to write home about.  Cruise is not bad however but he's a professional and get's mucho bucks so he has to perform.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest! I have used it to find a bunch of new recipes and daily fixes around the house.  Some of the pins have inspired some very handy time and money saving techniques.
1476734941|4.0|The fast diet is easy and has encouraged me to eat healthier and less on the non FAST days as well. This is the way I ate naturally back when I was thin. Before all the snacks the food companies and diets recommended.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|I cant see Tom Cruise in this role.  he is a comedic 007 type character.  Three stars for a great story.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|I love this game and it's the best bubble game since Bubble Blast. I think that's what it was called. Anyway I like the levels, the action and the pace of this game.
B00A7Q814Y|5.0|An excellent Set of CDs. The envelope and covers are cheap; and the print artwork is non- existent. But the quality of the recordings and the selection are fabulous.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Extraordinary cinematography.  Very beautiful color.  Wish there had been more 3D where it seemed to pop out at the viewer.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I absolutely love this tv series. I am reading the books as well, and they are staying pretty true to them. Although, there are some things that I wish they would have included and some that I wish they hadn't included. The price per each episode isn't too bad, either. I only bought the first episode of this season and watched the others a different way. The quality of the episode I bought is better than the other ones that I already had!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I had not seen this in 3D previously, only on network TV.  3D made a great difference to enjoy the color and scenery.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I do use this to keep in touch with family and friends.  Now  I do read it to stay informed.
B003G93ZCM|5.0|This is a first hand story about moon trip.<br />Describes astronauts personal life as well as technological sides of the topic.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great big easy too see and use buttons for the kindle fire. I wish the letters on it was this large..
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love this game  not only is it free u can also play wth different people each game I play this game all the time
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|THIS IS A MOVIE THAT CAN BE WATCHED OVER AND OVER AGAIN, I WISH THE 2ND AND 3RD BOOK WOULD BE MADE
B006LSZECO|5.0|great twist. kept me guessing! I've never swayed so much on my loyalty and belief in a character in a novel.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I like JK Rowling, I like her writing style.  but I could not figure out what was going on in the story and have not been able to finish it.  I will try again.
B0033H7VI6|3.0|On the Heavy side, The tip is a little no the thick side need work to get a good edge.<br />not really good for small hands<br />Is more for in camp use,good for chopping.
0545265355|5.0|I loved the box set! The books are amazing! Really nice set... I'm really hapy with my purchase, got my moneys worth I think.
B0011XBLUS|5.0|Clint got his start eith his true classic film.. Who lse could have portrayed the Hero?Thetheme music ie great.  All in all just the ticket for all  escapists
B002QRWJA4|5.0|The Phantom of the Opera has become a classic I would say. Even though the plot is pure fantasy, it's fun to let your imagination run away. The music, of course, is first class considering who wrote it. I can't say how many times I've seen it, but quite a few.
B00D3J2QKC|5.0|What I can say? All-time bestseller. Well.. maybe not fully istorically accurate, but fabulous! I truly recommend it for any reader - and mini-series, based on it, too.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|My little one loves this show!  I highly recommend as a pre-nap show to watch especially if your little one needs to wind down!
B00AB7HESI|4.0|My son absolutely loves this app! He's so addicted to it! His dad and I also get addicted haha its a gray learning gameit
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very challenging once you get up into the higher levels.  Nice alternative to some other brain games I play.  Glad I loaded it on my tab.
B00AYQNOLW|5.0|This approach never gets old for me, this film reminds one the world is simply amazing! Beautiful cinematography & music as usual. These films will humble you.
B000000OU0|5.0|I enjoy listening to this CD very much and my wife also asked for one as well.  They are a great group.
B009NY43NY|2.0|After reading all the novels in less than a month this was the most disappointing.  It seemed as though the author was rushed into delivering a product and did so without much thought behind the story.  Its as though this story was pieced together from clipping off of the editor's floor.  As endings go, this was a dead end.  Sookie deserved a better ending.  Saving Sam's life was great, but letting Eric go without so much as lifting a finger to fight for him???  Come on!  Sorry, but Eric was a ruler and would never have been ruled.
B004A8ZWT2|5.0|Enjoyed the movie from start to surprising finish. Great price from Amazon always if you have the patience to wait for the deal.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Hi guys and girls minecraft is cool and play and buy it  you can mine for gold , iron , and diamound
B00DDXJRJG|2.0|Didn't help the issue with my Kindle HD sound, still not loud enough.  I would really like my Amazon coins back, but I know that is probably not going to happen.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is awesome cool and agility  flexible and super fun stay to ones for Ethan minecraft see you later bye
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|this was not the game like I thought , since I have it on my iphone and computer thought I could continue playing it on my kindle fire but it was not this is why I don't like it,.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I had problems setting it up at first, didn't want to &#34;connect&#34;.  once it did it's not exactly what I thought it would be.....
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is fun.<br />I love horse games.<br />It is great having a realistic horse to take care of and compete with.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Really enjoyed this book can't wait to read the next one in the series. Did not want to put it down!
B005XQLBU4|2.0|Cheesy graphic and sound effects. Removed from tablet. 12 more words required? What else is there to say this app sucks.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|excellent graphics, I just think there should have been a little hand to hand. But all in all a great game
B00C2IJJE6|5.0|Have seen this movie before and enough has been said about this great film.<br /><br />having it in steelbook is awesome..that too at 9.99 dollars...its a steal..love it...
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book kept me at the edge of my seat!  I couldn't put it down.  Bravo Sylvia Day!  You have me entwined in these characters!
B001GCUNYO|5.0|good movie...but not better than bourne series...but comes close....simple story ....girl gets abducted...father who is a former agent....goes and finds her and kills many ppl on the way....simple but effective....
B0000263YY|4.0|I read the reviews for this 2009 reissue and expected that the sound would be better than the 1998 MCA remastering.<br /><br />Well, after receiving this, I am sorry to report that the remastering from 1998 still outshines the audio quality here. But this is better than earlier 1990s Jet and Sony issues.<br /><br />However, this has faithfully retained the original LP artwork, which for some reason MCA decided to poorly redesign or reinterpret in its 1998 remaster.<br /><br />In any case, the music transports you wonderfully to a place where nobody dared to go.
B000Y7U98W|5.0|great move...good casting....but pretty hazy ending...is this sci fi...seems more like magic or ghostly.....but good movie nevertheless...one time watch! done!
B00A7KKPDK|5.0|I bought this for a granddaughter when she requested it.  Read a bit before giving it to her and had to get another copy to finish reading and give to another granddaughter.  Lots of laughs and some good suggestions here so recommend it to anyone looking for a good light read.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Great set. Glad to see it in blu-ray.  I have always been a Star Wars fan.  Nice to have the complete saga at my fingertips.
140006922X|4.0|A great book but I found it a little short. The notes at the end of the book were also a great read.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This author has newly become one of my favorites!!!!  She has the ability to make you feel not only read adjectives like \\"sharp, smelly, painful, twisted, and grotesque\\". Each character quickly becomes more than just a name but a living breathing hurting and imperfect human.  This is my favorite of the Gillian Flynn books. Everyone in the town of wind gap is a suspect and everyone is a victim.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Certainly there are some more mature episodes, but overall, my girls (ages 8 and 12) love the period costumes and the stories.<br />It's pretty tame compared with other television, even ABC Family, so I'm OK with them watching.<br />The wife and I like the stories, although the class separation is oftentimes difficult to swallow.<br />Overall good series. Beautiful scenes.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game subway surfers is very good but..... it can get boring it's linked to temple run and angry gran but is a lot better because it ha  upgrades New character's an  also u can collect things in your run to help you get further  and th  best thing about it is its absolutely free xxx
B0063M22QO|5.0|i love playing this game. i have it on my computer too. my husband &amp; i play this for hours.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Thank you Rod for this new album, it's just plain fun to listen to, worth the wait. Long time fans should not be disappointed.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this app. It makes reminders, notebooks, and organization so easy!!!!!  It is so awesome. I think everybody should have this app.
B00005O3VC|5.0|This is probably the BEST British Comedy ever made. I have watched this movie hundreds of times and still enjoy it! Great for the entire family.
B00933JL0A|3.0|This game is nice and easy to play, it will chew up a lot of your time, especially if you do research and upgrade your buildings. Fun to play initially but I got a little bored once I had a town built, but the Free version is worth playing, at least with this game you can try before you buy.
B000S0GYRU|4.0|Good old horror classic movie. Not recommended for small children. A little dated with it's views on witchcraft, but good none the less
B00A285OOW|5.0|I am fascinated by medieval history and especially the War of the Roses.  Gregory does a great job of making history come to life.  You realize that these were people who didn't know, from one week to the next, whether they or their children would survive, much less found a dynasty.  Gregory's books have helped me develop an understanding of the founding of the House of Tudor and the origins of renaissance England.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I highly edvice this game to other people I think that this game is the best game ever made in the history of games this game is a lot of fun
B00571F26Y|4.0|I haven't finished the book yet, but what I've read sofar it is a real eye opener. I am starting to understand why I have the tummy that I have. Since going gulten free I dropped few pounds and I'm starting to have more energy and feel better. Right now I am Wheat free 99% of the time. It takes awhile to get started, it is not easy at first.
B001JIDE3M|5.0|Brendan Fraser is AWESOME. Love his character. His nephew and guide were a great fit.  Yhe movie made you feel like you were part of the adventure. LOVE IT!!
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I absolutely love both of these new star trek movies, I especially like the fact we get to see the older Mr. Spock again. Very good highly recommend it to any trekkie!
B00007GZR0|5.0|This is a classic movie with my favorite actors. Rock and Doris are a great couple with everyday problems. Loved it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I became aware of Hugh Howey because I am a writer.  As a means of inspiring myself and motivating my own self-publishing efforts I have followed and tried to learn from those that have become outliers in the still developing world of e-book commerce.<br /><br />So I knew of Hugh and his series of books for months before I read Wool.  At first I though he was some kind of marketing genius.  How could an unknown author achieve such success?<br /><br />Months after reading interviews with Hugh and watching his sales and fame escalate I downloaded the first book in the Wool Omnibus, Wool, for free.<br /><br />I liked it...a lot.<br /><br />Then, when Hugh was promoting the Wool Omnibus a few weeks ago and dropped the Kindle price to $1.99 I busted out my wallet (virtually) and bought the whole thing.<br /><br />I really like it... a lot.<br /><br />Recently I won an autographed set of the five books in the Wool Omnibus signed by Hugh.<br /><br />I'm now a fan.  Hugh even knows my name, sort of...<br /><br />But winning his books and having my name kind of sort of become familiar to Mr. Howey has done nothing for my book sales...<br /><br />But I have learned something very important from Hugh, something I think all authors and readers know innately...<br /><br />It is the story that matters.  A well written, interesting story with characters of depth and situations with meaning that provoke thought will make a writer successful.<br /><br />Mr Howey delivers in Wool.  I'm looking forward to reading more.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|What a great performance. I am someone who watches movies over and over but this is at the top of my list. It never gets tiring. Excellent sound and performers. BUY it without hesitation.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|A little slow at times, but very thought provoking.  Great book to debate did he do it?  What would you do as a parent?  Easy quick read
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|If someone you love suffers from mental illness this movie will be insightful. Beautifully portrayed. I'd rank it with One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest and Beautiful Minds.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|This game is fun and challenging.  My kids love this game.  They keep asking for more bubbles.  I can not put the game down.  I like the little Dragon.  With this there is nothing to change but more levels would be fine.
0385345054|5.0|My book arrived this morning. I'm not sure what I was expecting, maybe a few projects and templates. OMG  I was so shocked when I opened the box -- a really beautiful hardcover book. I think this book is worth way more than the retail price, but I'm grateful that I was able to get it.<br /><br />Page after page of beautiful, color-rich flowers, either fantasy or actual blooms. Templates, instructions, supplier list all included. They bring up things I hadn't even thought of, such as using watercolor and acrylic paints to create realistic looking effects.<br /><br />This book, which is a work of art in and of itself, is going to get plenty of use. I feel as if it's Christmas and I finally got what I actually wanted.<br /><br />This is a must-have!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This guy tells a compelling story!  I love the POV changes from chapter to chapter...if you are thinking about it, give it a shot!  Great story!  Valar Morghulis!
B007R6UWN0|5.0|Love many BBC mysteries and this is a very good one. Good acting, Jason Isaac's character is delicious.<br />Well done.
B005H9B44A|4.0|Fast paced and kept my interest even though I watched it on my iPad in a hotel while I was traveling
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This is a great calculator for regular folks as well as<br /> near sighted people. The numbers are huge and clear.
B00EAI9CSY|5.0|Overall, this is an excellent movie and well worth the time and money to watch.  In a time of too many vampire movies, in particular Twilight, this was an interesting and unique story.  And it really moved away from the dangerous male vampire seducing an innocent girl.  There are 2 strong female lead characters.  It is very well acted, and I think it moves at a good pace revealing story as it goes.  I think at times it might appear slow, because it is building anticipation in the audience for resolution.  There is depth to the characters and realistic and interesting interaction/relationships.  There aren't clear divisions between good and evil.  Characters all fall somewhere in the gray area on the continuum, which really reflects the reality of the human or superhuman condition.
B00632HWOG|5.0|These are by far one of the best shoes I've had.  I even wear them to work. I am on my feet all day and they are so comfortable.  Had to have another pair.  This is the second ones I've bought

0425263924|1.0|I will be blunt...the ending of this book sucks! But, then again it is not the end. Suppose to be 3 books. Now I find out there will be 2 more books. Eva is a total disappointment in this book. Sylvia Day could have rapped this up and brought this all together at the end of this book.  No need for 2 more books.  I sure won't buy the next 1 or 2!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|There aren't many games I rate, but this is fun and a great time killer. It never gets boring. The graphics look nice on my SGS4 and it's not complicated. Enjoy!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was one of those books that you just can't put down.  Since the plot went in directions I never expected, it was continually fresh and stimulating to read.  Couldn't wait to inhale the next books in the series.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This works well the ads don't bug me at all they are out of the way so if you need a simple calculator this is it

B003L77G06|5.0|No review required...  the ratings speak for them selves. Buy a copy and you will be hooked on this show
B004U8VX2M|5.0|I did not see this series I. The 70's so it is a great show to watch while I impatiently wait for the next season of Downton Abby.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|A mix of daily life issues foudn with multi racial families, gay couples adoption and day to day life events...  worth watching the entire seasons start to finish

B0089EHWQE|5.0|I loved this book! However, I had hoped he would change his mind by the end. I cried like  &#34;a hampster&#34;. It takes a &#34;very well&#34;<br />written book to get me that emotional.<br /><br />Nancy-Jean Anthony
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The Chromecast unit came in a small compact box, with operating instructions inside the cover of the box.  I had it up and running in less then 10 minutes using the USB Port.  Just to make certain I also hooked up via the power plug and that worked great.  Signing on with my Google ID was fast and clean.  Within seconds I was casting to my TV.<br /><br />Google Music and Google Movies played flawlessly and I can now see and hear them on my home theater setup.  What a difference.<br /><br />This item is clearly worth the cost.  If you subtract the free 3 months of Netflix the real cost of the item drops to $11.00.<br /><br />The unit does get warm but it doesn't seem to effect its use.
B003NTSBUG|1.0|Take a great author, a great director, a distinguished cast and what do you get?  An unwatchable film, in this case.  From the first shots, the nagging doubts begin: overly dramatic music and a boat appearing, too soon, far too soon, out of the fog.  Then take three blasts from the foghorn, but not just any foghorn, an extremely loud, extremely discordant foghorn.  The director wants to make sure you know this is going to be dramatic.  Follow this with myriad other cliches:  there's only one boat and no other way off an island full of the insane.  Then the guns of the two federal agents are taken, protocol you see, and, oh yes, there's a storm brewing, further isolating these two hapless souls come to investigate misdoings at the asylum.  Mix in crypts in the storm, excessively made-up inmates, a couple of creepy doctors, and soon those old Vincent Price and Roger Corman movies begin to look Oscar-worthy by comparison.  But don't take my word for it.  Google Anthony Lane's review from the New Yorker.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|I'm a guy and I really dig this show. There are some moments where it gets a little bit too &#34;chick-flickish&#34; for me, but I dig romances and this show has lots of romantic scenarios. The character, Jenna, is also a very likeable character. A character that is not materialistic, but still not jaded or emo is refreshing.

0064471837|5.0|When you're 12 years old and expected to follow suit with all the other adolescent tweens you should be worrying about trendy clothes, how to apply make up, if your best friends were coming to that party and whether your parents would let you go....In 2012 when I was 12 years old my greatest concern was why it had taken so long for Sabriel to enter into my life and whether anyone else understood how fantastic this book was.<br /><br />12 year old me was all about epic fantasy adventures; with good outwitting evil and destinies unfolding. I craved literature that held meaning and that fuelled the ever optimistic hoper in me.<br /><br />So, sitting in a public library in Manchester, on a cold Saturday during the winter, in breezed Sabriel carrying the sounds of Belgaer on the wind.<br /><br />Sabriel is the first of the Abhorsen trilogy and does wonders in setting the scene. Sabriel focuses on the story of an intelligent young girl, balancing on the cusp of womanhood, with an absentee father and a power within her that most (let alone she) can understand.<br /><br />However when it becomes clear that her father may be in danger, Sabriel crosses the Wall in search of him. Along her way Sabriel's companions are in the form of Mogget a free magic construct that takes the form of a house cat and Touchstone, former guard to the Queen.<br /><br />Facing the greatest of challenges, together they take on one of the greatest enemies to the Old Kingdom, Kerrigor.<br /><br />The idea of revealing too much of the storyline is detestable to me. Therefore, you'll just have to read it, but if you like fantasy adventures, if you like light overcoming the darkness, if you like epic battles, if you like courage and bravery...then Sabriel is the book for you.<br /><br />From 2012 to now I have read this book over and over again. Every time I do, I find something new and a learn something new, about myself, about humanity, about truth, about passion, about life.<br /><br />Even if you're not 12 years any more, read Sabriel, and feed the child inside of you, because unknowingly to you that child deserves the adventure.not 12 years any more, read Sabriel, and feed the child inside of you, because unknowingly to you that child deserves the adventure.

B004G6TD66|5.0|I have loved this one for a long time. It came early and in great shape. The jacket was very good condition
B000001GBJ|5.0|This is a great CD as the music is very beautiful,  soothing and relaxing.  I would recommend to anyone who's looking for some music to relax to, or mediate with.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|I think this book is a good source of information but it is very technical. At least for me who is not a &#34;tech wiz&#34;<br />It does however map up the process very well and plus, it's free!
B0036S4B6M|1.0|I never thought I'd say this, but I love the show and hated the book. Poorly written and in the book Piper is a very unsympathetic character.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Extremely fun I am really enjoying this game.it is easy fun and addictive. I find things to be one of the best games in the app store
B000LXQVA4|4.0|I would have given this product 5 stars but setting it up and taking it apart to wash is a bit difficult. The batteries are also hidden, making it hard to put in. Other than that I recommend this to anyone who has a froggie of a child (jumping up and down). My little girl loves it!!!
B003Y5H4SO|5.0|This movie was way better than I expected. Great movie, great plot, great idea. Theres even a twist in the end that you dont expect.
B003Z49LYO|4.0|Sad; not a good choice if you want an uplifting film. But it is a good adaptation of a classic.
B007DIQC90|4.0|My sister wanted this for her birthday,so I bought it for her. Very good quality, good cd. This cd is worth buying.

0545586178|5.0|Catching Fire is . . . insane. I mean, there is so much going on. A deeper, inside look at the Capitol and its inhabitants. Meeting old victors. Becoming who the Capitol wants her to be.<br /><br />Katniss has a huge struggle in this book. And not because of Gale v. Peeta. But, really, with what Snow wants her to be, and what she is. Suddenly, she's thrust under the spotlight with Peeta, and expected to act a certain way, dress a certain way, talk a certain way, and BECOME a certain way. No longer is she just Katniss Everdeen, girl from the Seam. Now she's Katniss Everdeen, Girl on Fire-slash-Starcrossed lover-slash-Victor. And she's just what the Capitol wants this season.<br /><br />She has unintentionally become a spark for the long-simmering rebellion, and things are about to get nasty. She viciously tries to contain the spark and keep her mother and sister from becoming targets of Snow. Despite her best efforts, the rebellion will not be quieted. It's been waiting for 75 years, and it's ready to come out and play.<br /><br />And then she gets devastating news. She and Peeta are both forced back into the arena for a second time: except, this time, there's a twist.<br /><br />They have to fight against the other victors.<br /><br />Cue introductions for the vicious Johanna Mason, the snarky Finnick Odair, the genius Beetee, the wise Mags, and so many more. Thrown against each other in yet another battle to the death, they team up in efforts to stay alive. And they all have the same goal: Defy the Capitol, save the Spark.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins crafts a brilliant web of characters and scenery. The plot thickens to the point of a suspense so tense, you can't put the book down. The characters are realistic and they leap from the pages, forcing you to admire their viewpoints and sympathize with their pain.<br /><br />The scenery she shows is incredible. You can feel the deceptive beauty of the Capitol, even when evil lurks in every shadow.<br /><br />Reading this book is like discovering something new. You read it, and you see things that you can relate your everyday life to. And it's scary. You line up the world and Panem, and you see it. You see things that happen today.<br /><br />So, when you read this book, keep your mind open and just remember who the real enemy is.book is like discovering something new.

1455523550|5.0|I had already seen the movie but got surprised that it had a lot more story to it. I always like reading books because they have much more details than the movies, and lately I've been reading a lot from Nicholas Sparks.
0439023521|4.0|I loved this book. The style is fascinating. The characters are so ALIVE. You can feel them. You might think you know what will happen, but this book is not at all predictable. Or, maybe, I was too immersed in the mind of Katniss to try to predict the outcome. It wasn't at all what I expected.<br /><br />This book is not solely for entertainment. Oh, no. It sheds light on just how much we yearn for entertaining, that we will let anything slide. Even if that entertainment plays on the emotions and pain and death of others.<br /><br />Think you wouldn't ever watch something where kids kill themselves? Think again. Think about all the survival shows you watch. Think about the movies you watch. It's just one step away from The Hunger Games, or so Collins says.<br /><br />In short, this book is deep and so much more than a trifle teen's amusement. Don't let the media fool you with their constant talking of \\"the next Twilight\\" and blah blah blah. It is NOTHING like that.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|It brings me back to childhood! So many memories and I still watch it today. It's a funny family movie with some interesting fantasy elements, and Danny DeVito does well as a director and father of the main character (played by Mara Wilson). It makes for a great gift to children and the user did a great job with shipping and handling. Recommended!
B00EFNXPFK|5.0|Probably my favorite John Mayer CD ever. It was pure perfection. I loved the CD's progression and how the songs fit perfectly together. I loved the Bluesy feel and the old-timin' country feel. His duet with Katy Perry was beautiful. I bought the CD and road tripped 9 hours and still didn't want to stop listening to it when I reached my destination!
B005LAIHEA|5.0|This movie was great and fun to watch with my girlfriend. I bought it for her for Christmas and she loved that I did. It's a funny movie but it does have its moments where it can actually be quite sad. I wouldn't say it's a full on romantic comedy but I guess it coud be in that category. It's a good couple movie. The user is recommended as well!
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Tina Fey is funny, thoughtful and real in this book. She writes like you would expect her to, with the voice of a down to earth comedian. Quite enjoyable.
0399255370|5.0|I got this book for my little cousins, who are budding artists. I found the concept charming, and the drawings and written letters are smart and funny (and made me think about which colors I would use most frequently). A cute book about art and color that certainly made me laugh.
B00632HWOG|4.0|For some reason I couldn't get my English Yahoo on my American Kindle, but this app allows me to check my UK emails.<br />I haven't really spent loads of time on it to give a full review, but from what I've seen it's pretty user friendly.

B0006Z2KXE|5.0|The Philadelphia Story was very in enjoyable to watch. The type of a movie that a person will enjoy re watching again and again. Cary Grant, Katharine, Hepburn, and James Stewart. Give and outstanding Performance in the movie.
B00846REIS|4.0|I liked this book it was similar to Fifty Shades but yet different, i look forward to the next novel...
B00000FC5H|5.0|What could anyone possible say bad about the elements of the universe...this is an awesome collection of some the bands most prolific,and emotion-provoking work. Whatever you were doing, wherever you were,  the timeless music of EW&F brings all those emotions flooding right back to your cranium...enjoy the trip!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game was a fun and different kind of a puzzle game than any I had played before, and I really like it.  My 14 y.o. son found he really liked it too, which surprised me.  It can be as easy as you want, or as challenging as you want.
B00004SZWD|5.0|Political, lyrical, sexual, corporeal, ageless, enduring, thought provoking, protesting, rallying, loving, hating, all of the adore-mentioned, partial keys of life. That's what this collection brings to life.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game, and have had a lot of fun with it.  But I will say that once you get to a certain point it seems to lose it's enjoyability.  I got ahead of the game and the challenge is out of it.  But I really enjoyed playing it before that time.  If I could reset the game and start over, I would do that.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game if you like to be challenged! Hope there are more of these. I would not change anything about this app!
B0088W6LGY|5.0|It was good to see an old favorite of mine on amazon prime. The acting can be a bit cheesy, but overall the show is good.
B0024FADDI|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend, since it's his favorite, and he loves it! It's just what he wanted. Everything was exactly on point.
0321934318|5.0|Just what I was looking for. Provided many procedures that I would have missed without this book.  A must have.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|This book grabbed me from the very start and I could barely put it down.  What courage and persistence. Amazing path with amazing results.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|After seeing the movie I was anxious to read the book and I am glad that I had the movie as a frame of reference or I am not sure I could have made it thru the book.  But I was glad I read it.
B00CE6E6B2|2.0|when you get to level 10 I believe they start throwing some quests in that require to use bucks. you may have a couple or so from them but it starts to build. you will have to either pay real cash or save up during the game through quests.
034553056X|4.0|There isn't much more to say. For Grisham fans, it's pretty standard fare. Nothing spectacular but a good read none the less.
030746363X|4.0|Good and interesting read! I definitely recommend to others! Wish it came in paperback though. I think everyone should read this.
B002ZG980U|5.0|I have watched this movie at least six times! What a fantastic story and so well done. It is a movie for an intelligent movie-goer. The plot is fairly complicated, yet easy to follow. The action is non-stop to match the music score. Wonderful!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love this game, play everyday on FB or Tablet.<br />I dislike that I can not have on my cell phone, because they havent put it out for ppl with Windows phones :(<br />Would be able to probably play more if I had on cellphone. Also credit and Blue Balls cost to much and their daily credits dont cover but 4-6 games and then you have to wait till another day and it sometime stinks because you want to keep going but buying credits are to much money and there sale are never sales.
B00003CXA6|5.0|I like American history and especially the Civil War period. This is an absolutely accurate re-enactment of the battle of Gettysburg, 10 years in the making. The cast was very well selected and the acting superb. I highly recommend it.
B006KX3GXO|2.0|I now have a windows phone and PicsArt does not have an app yet with them and I can not use on my cellphone anymore.<br />I would consider that why i gave them a bad rating would like to have on my cell. And havent used in a while because of this.
B004DM1ZQY|4.0|I really enjoy playing this game.  That is all I really have to say, I don't know why there is a number of words restriction.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This device is great. I've been using it for a few weeks now. I use it for netflix, youtube, and google music.  It works well with my android devices as well as my wife's iOS devices.  It will even change the input for you.  It will even cast my entire desktop for playing local files on my computer.  However this last function doesn't seem to work to well for HD playback.  I'm not sure if its because of my internet speed or what?  Overall, I am very satisfied and for $35 it's a no brainer!
B004TTHLBE|5.0|This is the second or third time I've read this book and I find things that I didn't pick up before. Once I start reading this story it is so very hard to put down, even though I already know how it ends.
0307887448|5.0|He loved the book and so did I.  Not something I would usually pick up to read but very interesting
B00CWY76CC|5.0|very fun and challenges your mind love it gives new ways to exscape makes you think I say its a five all the way
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is very fun and entertaning. The bad thing is you just have to buy bannanas and grue coins for real money.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Easy and simple information, that allows anyone to get a really good understanding on how the LOA works, and how to create the life we want for ourselves.  Basic, easy, simple, just brilliant!!

B009KS4XRO|4.0|I have several bingo games on my Kindle fire HD and a whole lot of other games that aren't bingo but this game is my absolute favorite one of all
B00867HDTA|4.0|I really wish there was an option where you could just shoot.  Kind of like a practice to get your skill set down so that way you can beat the other levels with ease.  The endurance is nice but putting a time limit on it kind brings it down.  Would be better if it was a ball limit.  I know there is one but it is only one ball which I don't like.  Add those and you guys get a five from me
1609611543|5.0|I was shocked to learn how much the wheat is in every product we ear or drink.  This is worse than what the cigarette companies did and the government know .... it is big business and a disgrace from our government, big business on down.  They are responsible for our poor health and know it but don't care.  KNOWLEDGE IS POWER ---
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoy this game.  I was sad to know I had beaten the last room.  Its so much fun working with friends and family.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This story has it all; well-written characters that you care about, suspense, mystery, and an intriguing world setting.  I couldn't put it down.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|We need the REAL game!! Just like this game, many of the games on the appstore, aren't on the Amazon Market.
0143121006|4.0|This is the true story of a young English Woman brutally murdered at a time when China was waiting for the Japanese invasion of Peking.  A time when you had no idea who to trust..not the police, the privileged Europeans and Americans.<br />Where could you turn to find the murderer or murderers?  It's part history book and part mystery. Peking at this time<br />Was decant and dangerous. Especially for a young woman.<br />Will this crime be solved with so much coverup?  Will the guilty pay for their crime? You will take a rickshaw ride down some terribly twisted streets. But, I think it's worth the ride.
B000FC1RCI|5.0|Sajgibb, it wasn't Vera. It was someone else... I don't want to ruin it for others. However, I am writing this under my mother's account. I am 14, going into 8th grade. This is an amazing book. All hail the queen of mysteries... Agatha Christie
B0063M22QO|5.0|Great graphics. Good colors. Easy to see graphics. Good mix of hard and easy layouts. A good game to play when waiting.
B00821OX98|3.0|There are a lot of cliques in this show and a lot of plot holes and the pacing of the first 7 episodes is glacier. That said, this season is watchable, and it should be watched, if just to prepare the viewer for the much better season that follows. Like all dystopian sci-fi stories, this struggles to have some relevance to the &#34;real world.&#34; The overall theme of Season 1 is (too) similar to the Walking Dead (there's just a substituting of aliens for zombies) in that the main antagonist is other humans (&#34;man's inhumanity to man&#34;). The alien invaders are almost incidental to the story until the final three episodes. The plot, characterizations, and writing/acting quality of Season 2 are improved in that the story becomes more about survival against a common enemy and the plot lines are faster paced and have more action. The editing and use of CGI are better in Season 2 as well.
0989524116|5.0|I received a copy of \\"Outin\\" (Inner Movement, #2) by Brandt Legg in exchange for an honest review. This is a great second installment from the first book in the trilogy \\"Outview.\\" This book continues the adventures of Nate and Yangchen and the story of the Movement. The book is about young adults but can be enjoyed by all ages. This novel combines elements of sci-fi, adventure and paranormal and is well-written. I personally enjoyed this book more than \\"Outview.\\"<br /><br />They made it back. Even after finding out that Nate and Dustin's father had been murdered by the government Lightyear, but Nate had been saved to help the world, based on his supernatural powers. Nate had killed agent Fitts that had tried to intervene, and now Nate is wanted for murder. Dustin had opened an invisible veil, a portal and they were all transformed into another world.<br /><br />Then in this different dimension, they meet Nate from the future.(11 months older) His \\"future self\\" tells him that, Nate is missing and their mom is in federal custody. And his girlfriends, Amber and Linh are dead. His best friend, Kyle is still alive. His future self tells him, that Nate is the next mystic...and they are going to change the future. They are now wandering in an extraordinary dimension, called \\"Outin.\\" In order to change the course of history, and prevent these two deaths, and their mother's arrest, they have to alter the right event in the correct sequence...Cause and Effect.<br /><br />Outin is the land of colored birds and bubbles. One of the most interesting things the group found on Outin were Windows, windows of a time and place, a frozen memory. An Outin month is equivalent to about an hour in reverse time. The future self told them to swim in each of the four lakes everyday, each with it's own power, dealing with fear, nourishment, dreams and fantasies and glimpses of the future. Then with the help of guides and teachers, they must master the five great powers.<br /><br />The people behind Lightyear are attempting to take control of the world. The only thing that can stop them is a mass awakening.<br /><br />Brandt Legg is a visionary and I was captivated with this novel from beginning to end. He manages to continue to ramp up the tension and intrigue. This novel explores concepts of enlightenment, reincarnation, good versus evil, portals, time and dimensions and life and death. The author does a god job to explain these concepts, as they relate to his novel, which adds substance to the novel. But most important are the deep many messages in the book, and thus will appeal to all ages. I would recommend that you read \\"Outview\\" before you read \\"Outin\\", as the first novel sets the stage for what is about to happen.<br /><br />\\"What kind of a future will be left?\\"ehind Lightyear are attempting to take control of the world.

I would recommend that you read \\"Outview\\" before you read \\"Outin\\", as the first novel sets the stage for what is about to happen.<br /><br />\\"What kind of a future will be left?\\"
B005CRY2O6|5.0|This is a great vegetable cookbook.  Many new ideas and combinations.  Great pictures and easy to follow?  Use it every week
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great app. Lots of fun love playing it. Kids enjoy it too. Thanks for creating this app. Gives the kids something to do.
B009AY04A8|5.0|Very addictive,fun...because it has different types of pic.finds. Not THE SAME each level. Love it. If you have the time....it's a must have. I just WISH SOMEONE would come out with a FREE ***REAL DEAL CANDY CRUSH SAGA*** for the Kindle HD....
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun with horses without the real mess. The only thing that is annoying is the whole gem thing. In order to be able to do certain things you have to have purple gems. In order to get them you write a review of the game for 3 free ones or you have to purchase them with real money. Plus we get to put up with ads now too. Oh well you pay your penny you take your chances.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|It was good but it could have been better it was nice in some ways it was nice and bad
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|Reminds me a little of team fortress but the controls are a little hard to manage. If you practice enough, you can handle the controls well and be good at the game.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This is worth every coin if u choose to purchase the full game but it's still amazing if you decide to play for free. I am about to tap and destroy Apple because they are tapped out!<br />-Royal Assassin
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved this book! I'm honestly thinking about reading it again! So much better then fifty shades of grey! I highly recommend this book!!!!!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|The game is fun if you like find the difference style of games... I am not a fan of the social media style activities but it's free for a reason
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Beautiful photography. Excellent directing and acting. Quality show. Very disappointed by the turn of events in season three however. A little too much doom and gloom.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|was great for s little while but after the update it no longer loads. I uninstalled and reinstalled still nothing and lost all progress. my little girl had been building her thing for months just to lose it all. Highly disappointed
B005XQLBU4|5.0|this is a really good missile defense game I would definitely recommend my only issue is not enough points for upgrades.
B006OKOZGU|5.0|One of our favorites, this is a great restoration of a classic movie.  If you haven't seen it, definitely do. Grace Kelly and Cary Grant are wonderful.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|This is a very kid and pre-teen friendly movie.  It is difficult to find a movie that a 5 year old boy and a 11 year old girl will watch together.  This movie was well received by both parties and their parents.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|I purchased Annie for my granddaughter.  She is not yet three years old, but know the words to the songs.  In fact, she has played Annie so much it is scratched.  I am going to buy her another copy of Annie!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I just wanted a lighthearted love story and what do I get?<br /><br />This almost pathetically deep story of two people who happen to be teenagers who discover life through a looking glass of the most beautiful kind.<br /><br />As tumblr would say, \\"I can't even\\"
B003G4W49C|5.0|I got the Quartet of books for my birthday, I had Enders game read in the first day, it is a great read.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I don't think I will ever look at a dog the same way again!  This book is in my top 10 and I've read hundreds of books and I'm picky. I love a feel good story that makes you cry so hard one box of Kleenex is not enough. I know many of us hate reading about a dogs death but trust me this book is worth it. Please read this book you will not be sorry.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I was really into this book.  It shows the resiliency of children and how sometimes some good can come from the bad. It  skipped back and forth from present day to the past and kept me interested the whole time which is rare these days!
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I am a truck driver, so I use my ear piece all day, this case is so nice, I am always managing my outlets in my truck and now this is one thing I don't have to charge, I just put it in my case when I am unloading and it last me all day, I charge it in the morning before I leave the house, I don't even take the cord with me. It works well with my iphone 5, I wish my iphone battery lasted this long. The first time I used it I had to turn the iphone on and off and then all was good.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Loved the way the author presented the new reality for the job market and the personal feelings related with it. Highly recommended.
0817439390|5.0|I am strictly an amateur photographer and I have read quite a few books to learn and hone skills.  This is by far the best I have read.  It is not the first I've read by Brian Peterson.  I have been using quality cameras since receiving a college graduation gift of a Voigtlander Bessamatic in 1960.  There are things about light in this book that I had never thought about and which have heightened my interest in getting better pictures.  Thank  you  Mr. Peterson.
B00992CF6W|3.0|It's good for getting your minecraft fix when you're not at your computer. It's best on tablets. The controls are iffy and is a bit ambitious for a tablet game in the industries current state.
B005F2BBLK|4.0|i enjoyed the movie i also enjoyed Johnny Depp's voice. The animation was clear and not primitive. i really like Johnny Depp!
B0063M22QO|5.0|I have never played Manning before, but have always heard about the game.  Now that I've played it with this app, I find it to be fun and quite addictive.
B005OT2YVA|1.0|This movie was just terrible. I couldn't even finish it. What a terrible collection of moments recorded on film. Just horrible.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|A very good and versatile mic I can put this in my costumes and take anywhere, it's the best mic I've purchased!
B00C7KYXHW|4.0|Very good show.  It is based on characters in the book, &#34;Red Dragon,&#34; which is a prequel to the more popular Silence of the Lambs. There are plenty of differences between the book and show that it keeps you guessing as to what will happen. I love the character Will Graham!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great, addictive game that you don't have to spend a dime to progress.  The humor in the movies definitely comes out in this game, and I love it!!
B008XKSW7M|4.0|I think that there was much to enjoy about this movie.  Very funny.  Not as predictable as I had imagined.  Strongly recommend.
B001NHNG64|5.0|This is a good mystery and thriller and I was guessing to the end  -- thought I had one bad guy figured out, but wasn't sure until the last.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|This was the best Star Trek movie I have ever seen.  The scenes, acting, and special effects were amazing.  Strongly recommend.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Its a fun game. However, everything costs lots of coins, and coins are hard to get. So it always wants you to spend money. Consistently.
B00CF34B2I|2.0|it takes up more than 3/4 of my memory and still says I don't have enough memory<br />so I was never able to play it after 30minutes of installing
B00475AYJQ|5.0|i love this series.  two books in a series?  anyway---they're long books but i never wanted them to end---and so far this one hasn't ended.  i'm not through it yet.  well written, holds my interest.  is there another one in the works?  please?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I am always looking for a good animal game and if I find a game where you can take care of horses ALIM SOLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!This will always be my favorite game!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I began this book on a whim; needed a lite read during a camping trip this summer. I darted reading and couldn't put it down; excellent fairytale!
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|So bizarre to think that the mind of Glee came up with this tasty morsel that is completely opposite.  Enjoy and worth the money.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I'm a Sherlock Holmes nut and I love this series.  I like the modern-day version.  The two main characters have good rapport.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|All three (3) apps I have from this developer are clean, uncluttered and functional.  I would certainly recommend any of the ones I own without hesitation.
B005544TRQ|5.0|The show moves fast and when you just seem to think you know what is going to happen next. Bam, it changes gears.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game certainly is addicting!! Great realistic game play!! The little girl I babysit is always so excited to visit beauty!!
B000W9399S|5.0|I also have the DVD of this and perfectly enjoyed reading this after seeing the DVD, and then reading it again, and seeing the DVD again, etc.,.etc., etc.  I would recommend this to anyone who is in love with Diskworld!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Takes 2 minutes to set up the unit and the rest is history. As Google expands the functionality and partners with more services, the value of this little piece of technology will only grow.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This is so well done.  My only comment would be that I wish the rest of the series about the Hobbit were out by now, too.  The actors were all perfect and just what I imagined they would be.  Can't wait until the next movies come out.  The scenery is also fabulous!
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|A fun game you can play at your own pace.  Any age can enjoy this game any time as well as any where.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Kept me working at it. Enjoyed the challenge. Would like to try more! Can't wait to get started I love it!
B00DHHWYAW|3.0|I really want to absolutely love this movie to death, i really do. I remember reading the book in high school and I loved it so much. I loved the symbolism, I loved the true emotional feel it gives off, there is just something about this movie that I'm not even sure how I feel about it. The reason I gave this a higher star was that I loved the story, and it really stuck close to the book, and i loved the actors in this film they did an amazing job. Leonardo DiCaprio's performance blew Robert Redford's performance as Gatsby away. The problem is the directing, it has the same problem that I personally didn't care for in Romeo + Juliet it is sooooo over-directed to the point where it all looks almost surreal. It felt like Baz Luhrman ran out of ideas to make movies so he picked up the book The Great Gatsby and said \\"wow this would make a good movie, I'm going to make this movie but first I'm going to drop some acid.\\"  No joke, that's what this movie felt like, a big loud acid trip. In ways i really liked it, but in others I really really really didn't like it. I felt like it needed a more straight forward director who doesn't over direct every single little tiny thing in the movie. Watch The Great Gatsby for yourself, its not bad, but it certainly isn't amazing, I'm just really on the fence about the whole movie.
B008602KQI|5.0|I can't wait for the second and third movie to come out. I hope she doesn't stop with the trilogy.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Looking for Alaska is considered by some as John Green's masterpiece and I am glad to disagree.<br /><br />The book deals with death and people that &#34;happens to be dying because that is a side effect of having cancer&#34; but it doesn't feel to force into any direction in particular.<br /><br />I enjoyed the dialogues and overall the characters. It made me smile, it made me laugh and also cry.<br />Recommended lecture !!! :D
B004Q3QRWC|5.0|A writer of our day who draws from the reader sympathy for each of her characters as they go through &#34;life as we know it&#34;.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|I liked it. Thought the story line was very interesting. Love gone bad. How you never really get over someone you loved.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|I found the DVD to be very enlightening regarding those who make their living cooking &#34;crank.&#34;  It was also very inspirational in showing the courage/strength of one young woman's efforts to preserve her way of life and that of her siblings and Mother.  A good buy.
0307719774|5.0|I once had the &#34;One Line A Day&#34; and was really sad when I lost it after doing it for 7 months. My friend replaced it, but my heart was no longer in it. I got this one earlier this year (I recommend starting these things on January 1st- it just makes it easier), and like it so much better. The questions are interesting, it's not just random misguided babble on my part, and I'm curious to see how my answers will change over the next 5 years. 8 months (almost 9) and going strong!
B00EOO55GW|2.0|Album is good but definately lack the power and had hitting sound of previous a7X albums. Its honestly nothing special. M shadows voice seems better than previous albums. sin's solos are amazing as usual. there melodies are amazing as always with so many things that create a full sound . thats the good the bad how ever is that not one song is up beat or fast, drums are not rev, not portnoy not anything better than what a mediocre metal drummer could do. there repetitive boring and give to drive to the music, think lamer lars ulrich. over all id say skip it not worth the money. I understand they want to evole there sound this is not evolution its an attempt to sound more main stream like vintage metallica and other old school metal .  a song or two like that would have been cool but the whole album come on. definately a true disappointment.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Not too difficult, but challenging enough that I'm not spending forever in one room. Love this game, can't wait for more.
B00005A0ZH|2.0|I didn't know that it wasn't compatible w/ US dvd players. I can't watch it :( Then I did some research and saw that Ridley Scott hasn't released it on DVD or BlueRay in the US yet and there is no date for it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I just love everything about this book. You will cry a lot for sure but You will fall in love whit it. Still crying. Read it, you will not regret it.
B0081L391C|4.0|Hilarious film with great acting by both Tatum and Hill. It exceeded my expectations although the beginning of the movie seemed a bit rushed. Would highly recommend it!!
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|My husband and I enjoyed this and all the twists and turns of a complex plot. Great story and the acting was excellent.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The kids LOVE this game!  It keeps them entertained for a while and I am happy to be able to trust it and not worry about the content.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Enjoy playing the different games.  Bingo slots are fun.  Some of the items are really hard to get.  Spend lots of coins trying.  Over all game has its great moments.
B004SIP7AS|4.0|This movie was cute and entertaining. It followed the book fairly well. I would recommend it to Jane Austen fans.
B009AY04A8|4.0|This is the 1st hidden object game I've played where there was a story line. Good graphics, but the diologe can drag on a little too much. Also, some of  the scenes were a bit redundant. However, I would &amp; have, recommendended it to family &amp; friends. You can tap the screen to bypass the story, but for me that is what sets this game apart from the other hidden object games. I got the 1st game as a free game, but I plan on buying more of this kind.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Hours of fun with this game my 16 year old son even loves this game and will give his xbox a rest
B00846REIS|5.0|I'm a big fan, love the  characters and couldn't put it down! Can't wait to read the second one! If you like 50 shades of gray this is definitely a good series to read.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|I am slowly building my DVD library and often I find myself wanting to watch a video that is entertaining, with an excellent script, good acting, pleasing sets, and a strong story.  This film delivers on all counts.  Especially enjoy all the references to other alien films.  This is such a great film, that I bet I have watched it at least a dozen times over the months that I have owned the DVD.  Another aspect of the DVD that I enjoy is the audio commentary.  Get it!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|The last time I used the app I could not use the &quot;Like&quot; button, comment on any of my friends status updates, or use the &quot;Share&quot; button. Please fix and update.
B003DT194G|5.0|Great western, they don't make movies like this anymore.  I am a big western fan, this is a classic. Good value.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Love the game,it great I can play it on my kindle.helps pass time lay up after surgery and go out to play.
B00C9U9YOW|4.0|first album I've owned,the more I listen,the more I enjoy it. A lot of variety in this album,and also changing beats within the same somg
B008KEQMDC|5.0|The movie got here fast and in great shape. Not even one scratch. It was like new. And for a great price.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|what a story Rodriguez is, and now continues to be. I was intrigued by the movie,bought all the albums,and actually saw him live. So nice he is getting recognition in his twilight
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app has everything I need to get the weather for the day or a couple of days away. I use it when I am on vacation to get that area's local weather.<br />It's a keeper.
B006LQQ1GE|3.0|didn't bond that much with this guy,perhaps a little soft for my<br />tastes,just didn't replay it alot,and have not listened in months
006178480X|1.0|I was surprised just how drastically my opinion differed from most of the people writing a review of The Eye of God on Amazon.com.  Loads of five stars.  What is everyone seeing that I'm missing?<br /><br />I found this book to be, in a word, awful.  I can't fault the pacing, but it was the writing itself that ruined it for me.  Take this description from page 27, for example:<br /><br />\\"Her slim face and high cheekbones looked carved out of pale marble.  Her almond-shaped eyes glinted like polished jade.  The only softness to her was the loose cascade of her hair, the color of a raven's wing.\\"<br /><br />Wow.  Is this an action-thriller or a *parody* of an action-thriller?  That writing is absolutely horrendous.  I was also distracted by simple but silly mistakes.  Rollins uses the word \\"enormity\\" improperly, for example.  He also writes that the new millennium started in 2000.<br /><br />I don't think I've ever given a book one star on Amazon.  But Rollins inept and cloying writing didn't warrant any better (in my opinion, of course).
0307279189|5.0|I got this book because I thought it was about how to run, but come to find out it is a story also. I got so wrapped up in the book I could not put it down. I have even recommended it to non-runners as a great book to read. It is one of those books you wish would go on and on........ one can only hope....
B001DHXT6G|3.0|The cases were broken in shipping. Not happy since this was a gift for my grandson and he didn't tell me right away or I would have returned it.
B0000TAZBK|5.0|I'm not the type who would normally buy a musical score for a movie but Howard Shore's work on LOTR is an exception to that rule - I'm buying his musical scores for 'The Hobbit' as well.  They don't get better than these...  I would mention a few specific numbers in the score I like but truth is they're all amazing.  Everyone should own this masterpiece as far as I'm concerned.  I'll also give a nod to the musical score in Gladiator which I also thought was also really well done.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I absolutely love this game!!!!! I play mostly on a kindle fire hd.  I have never had a problem or complaint about the or the app. I recommend bingo blitz to all my friends that like to play. Thank you for this free game!!!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show!!! I love how all the characters are so well developed!!! Great plots!!! It's a wonderful ride!!!
B00BEIYH6U|2.0|I really had high hopes for this movie. I saw it on the very first day it came out, after waiting half a year for it to come out. I loved the first movie and watched it over and over again. Then, finally, it came out and I saw it. What a let down!!!<br /><br />The movie tried so hard to be as good as the first, but it doesn't even come close to it. It could be that in this movie their was a different director than the first and I do believe that played a big part in it's failure. I thought the movie had a pretty good story to it, but the scenes on how it was done was bad. The jokes were not as good as the first movie either. Also, the acting was really done badly because I think the director didn't help them bring out their skills well.<br /><br />What did I not like about the movie? First thing, I didn't like was that they keep on showing Big Daddy's costume over and over again. I think I saw it 4 or 5 times in the whole movie! What the point was the point in showing me that costume so many times?  I thought they were going to somehow get again person to use it or maybe Kick-Ass would put it on or something. But, nothing ever happened. It was so dumb that they did that. If the point was to make the audience remember Big Daddy or show that Hit Girl still cares a lot of about her dad wishes, well I got that after seeing it the first time. That was done and done, no need for anymore of those useless scenes. Also, Kick-Ass did put on black body armor at the end, but that wasn't Big Daddy suit to me. Why? Because Bid Daddy suit is different! His belt says \\"BD\\", Kick Ass's belt says \\"KA\\". Daddy's wear all black suit. Kick Ass's wear's green and yellow! Mask? BD is all black, guess what, did Kick Ass wear a Black Mask? No, he did not! So, what do we have here? All Kick Ass did was put on any old body armor and that's supposed to be BD suit? I say, HELL NO! If so, then, you're saying we really needed to see BD suit 4 or 5 times just to see Kick Ass put on body armor. It isgenius - NOT!<br /><br />The second thing I didn't like. Why did they have to kill off Jim Carrey\\"s character, Colonel Stars and Stripes, so soon? If you wanted to do a moment like having Big Daddy characters die like in the first, they should had done it right. When he died it was towards the end and people really liked him a lot at that point but having him died made the movie move forward. Colonel Stars and Stripes didn't needed to die so soon, he could had lived and the message could had still moved the story forward. Up to that point, Colonel Stars and Stripes was the best thing in the movie, and then, he was just gone! I believe the audience really was confused and lost, just as much as the characters in the movie were. Then, I lost much interest in the movie.<br /><br />The third thing I didn't like. Naming the Super Villains in the movie stupid or racist names. No, it not that funny. Not even a tiny bit. It just dumb what they did. They wanted to force a laugh out of people, but people have to be really low in intelligence to get that kind of humor. I mean really, they could had done much better with the jokes than coming up with ridiculous names.<br /><br />I could go on with a list of things I hated about this movie, but I won't because there just too many things and I believe I wrote enough items for now. If there is a Kick Ass 3 with the same director, I would NOT watch it. No way, no how.<br /><br />If you loved the first movie, you will be greatly disappointed with this second movie, and so, I don't recommend this movie.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|You've got to love Lewis.  Such an outcast--but still gets the job done as a lawyer.<br />Well acted, a little quirky, but pure entertainment.<br />If you find yourself with nothing to watch. Try this!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Incredible book with a great story line. I loved the characters in this book and didn't want the story to end. I  would highly recommend it!
B006LXQID8|3.0|Cute, movie, cute actress, cute story, AWESOME soundtrack. Stirs up all kinds of warm fuzzy emotions. Subtitles are easy to follow. great movie.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Really fantastic graphics, very easy to play! It isn't difficult to earn coins or gems and the game itself goes pretty steady! Definitely recommend.
034544678X|5.0|Patricia McConnell is the best author on this subject, my favorite subject lately, dogs.  Another book out there, Inside of a Dog, is not so good.  That one has been as a nice term paper with fluff added, and that description is apt.  Other End of the Leash tells you, in an interesting way, what you really want to know about your canine.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The story moves along well, but the grammatics & syntax suck. The book gets some emotions going, just not sure they're always appropriate. For instance it bothers me that Katniss is so emotionally stupid. Especially for someone with her skill set. Then she gets drawn in by Rue so quickly & she seems emotionally balanced. Then back to emotionally stunted while intellectually she's able to work out what Haymitch intends with ease. I really liked the storyline & therefore gave it 4 stars. But with technology nowadays the writing style could've been better, as well as normalizing the heroine's emotional development.
B001AR0D4A|5.0|I love this movie, and this two disc collector's set give it out in both color and black and white editions.  I actually preferred the color, but the B&W did have a cool feel to it.  the movie itself is one of my favorites, harking back to the old golden age when other dimensions were scary places.
B009AY04A8|5.0|Too much text and I can't find a way to skip it. Good graphics with reasonably tough work to find since there is no zoom.<br /><br />On the other hand, it is a long game well worth the price. I won't buy a game that times me. I think this a good value in need of some revisions. I recommend it.<br /><br />I am a bit embarrassed, but that is what happens when I review too quickly. I have changed the review to five stars from four, and did so because the main complaints I write above and not correct. There is a way to skip the wordy dialog, and there is a zoom function. I discovered both shortly after posting this review.<br /><br />I would still like to see the skip dialog button on the same page as the first bit of dialog, or better yet in the options so as to make it a global choice. As it stands now, I have to return to the menu each time the dialog starts, and choose skip there, and then resume the game. Not exactly intuitive and unnecessarily complex. It is a good example of the type of hidden object game that I like. Again, five stars.
1490313370|5.0|I've been reading about Mr. Altucher on Quora for the last few months.  I've been amazed at all the struggles he has gone through.  I decided to help support him and bought his book.<br /><br />I found this book to be quite a masterpiece.  The wisdom he provides is completely unconventional, but when you think about it... The steps are really quite obvious.  Yet, with all great things in life, the obvious just isn't too obvious to any of us.  He brings the obvious and puts it right in front of us.<br /><br />Mr. Altucher's writing has helped me live in the now, as opposed to hating my past or putting high expectations upon my future.  I'm able to actually live in the moment based upon the wisdom he has provided to a lost soul such as myself.<br /><br />I haven't completed his book, however I am on page 112, and I'm halfway through.  From page 107-112, I saw an excerpt that related directly to exactly where I was in my life.  I'll copy and paste it below.  However, before I do, I have to tell you that this book isn't all about business and \\"making it\\" in life.  This book goes much deeper.  What I have learned from this book is the key foundation to my happiness. Some essentials that we forget when we get caught up in our life.  Such as our need to love ourselves.  To spread joy.  To be grateful.  To have an attitude of abundance.  To take care of our bodies.<br /><br />With his 45 years of wisdom, I hope some of it has rubbed off on me and I could be 1/10th the man he is.<br /><br />Well, the excerpt that relates directly to my life is as follows.  It's quite amazing how these steps are the same ones I'm following, and I hope that one day... I will be able to spread the message that James has spread to myself.  Mr. Altucher, from the bottom of my heart... I thank you for taking the time out of your busy life to share this book with us.<br /><br />Page 107-112<br /><br />Let's get specific.  What should I do?<br /><br />You're probably asking: well, if I quit my job,what should I do?  I've begun asking people who did it.  What did they do?  How do they quit their jobs and, basically, make a million dollars?  Not everyone is Mark Zuckerberg or Larry Page.  Not everyone is going to drop out of college and create an iPhone or a time machine or a toilet that resizes itself automatically depending on who is sitting on it (although that would be pretty cool).<br /><br />Some people would simply like to quit their current crappy jobs and make a good living.  Some people would simply like to quit their jobs and make a million dollars.  In that Facebook movie (you know, the Justin Timberlake vehicle), JT says, \\"A million's not cool. A BILLION is cool.\\"<br /><br />Well, actually JT, very often a million is pretty cool.  Not everyone is going to be a VC-funded $100 million hotshot.  Sometimes, it's nice to make a million dollars, be your own boss, and use that financial success to catapult to freedom.<br /><br />I called Bryan Johnson, who started a company called Braintree.  You may have never head of Braintree but you've heard of their customers.  They provide credit card transaction and payment services for companies like OpenTable, Uber, Airbnb, etc.<br /><br />I've never spoken with Bryan before.  I am not an investor in Braintree.  As far as I know I'm not even an investor (unfortunately) in any of Braintree's clients.  I like to call people who I think have interesting stories and hear what they have to say.  That's the way I build my network of not only financial contacts but also potential friends.<br /><br />I knew Bryan had an interesting story about how he set up Braintree and I knew it would be helpful for those people asking \\"what do I do next?\\"<br /><br />The Cliff's Notes version: In 2007, Bryan was a manager at Sears.  He quit his job and started Braintree.  Within two years he was making more than a million per year.  Eventually, Braintree grew much bigger and raised $70 million from Accel and other investors.<br /><br />But that wasn't what was interesting to me.<br /><br />\\"How did you do it?\\"  I asked him.  \\"What are the steps?\\"<br /><br />\\"I really disliked my job,\\" he said, \\"and I never believed in the idea of getting a fixed wage.  I had been a salesman before in the credit card processing business where I would go out and get merchants like restaurants and retailers to switch their business to the company I was selling for.  So I figured I could do this but work for myself instead of another company.\\"<br /><br />Rule #1: Take Out The Middleman.  Instead of going back to the company he used to sell for, Bryan cut out the middleman and went straight to a credit card processor, worked out his own reselling agreement with them, and did all this BEFORE leaving his job at Sears.<br /><br />Many people ask me, \\"I'm at a job, should I raise VC money yet?\\" NO, of course not!  First you have to hustle.  VCs want to back someone who shows a little Ooomph!<br /><br />Rule #2.  Pick a Boring Business.  Everyone is always on the lookout for \\"the next big thing.\\"  The next big thing is finding rare earth minerals on Mars.  That's HARD WORK.  Don't do it!  Bryan picked a business that every merchant in the world needs.  He also knew that it was an exploding business because of the e-commerce explosion.  You don't have to come up with the new, new thing.  Just do the old, old thing slightly better than everyone else.  And when you are nimble and smaller than the behemoths that are frozen inside bureaucracy, often you can offer better sales and better service.  Customers will switch to you.  If you can offer higher touch service as well, they will come running to you.<br /><br />Rules #3.  Get a customer!  This is probably the most important rule for any entrepreneur.  People want to find and take the \\"magical path\\": get VC money, quit their jobs, build a product, and then have millions in customers.  It NEVER works like that.<br /><br />Bryan found ten customers (out of the first 12 he approached) who would switch their credit card processing to him.  He figured he needed to make $2100 a month to quit his job.  With his first ten customers he was making $6,200 a month, so he had a cushion in case some dropped away.  He quit his job and suddenly he was in business.<br /><br />Rule #4.  Build trust while you sleep.  This rule is often \\"Make Money While You Sleep.\\"  But Bryan was already making money while he slept.  He was making money on every credit card purchase with his first ten customers.<br /><br />I didn't want to be going up and down the street looking for customers,\\" Bryan said.  \\"I needed to find a way to get online businesses as customers.  Someone suggested that I needed to blog.  And to blog well you need to be totally transparent or it won't work.  So I started blogging about what was really happening in the credit card industry including all the unscrupulous practices and how merchants were being taken advantage of.  Then I'd put my posts on the top social sites at the time--Digg, Reddit, and StumbleUpon--and sometimes the posts would get to the top of these sites and my website would get so much traffic that it would crash.<br /><br />\\"But I became a trusted source about credit card processing.  So before long all these online sites that had previously had a hard time navigating this industry would start contacting me to switch their payment services.\\"<br /><br />A couple of things there.<br /><br />Rule #5.  Blogging is not about money.  Blogging is about trust.  You don't sell ads on your blog (rarely), you don't get the big book deal (rarely), but you do build trust and this leads to opportunities.  My own blog has made me a total of zero cents but has created millions in opportunities.  In Bryan's case it led to more inflow and his biggest early opportunity.<br /><br />\\"Basically, OpenTable called me and they wanted a software solution to handle storing credit cards, handling the data to restaurants, and being compliant from a regulatory standpoint.  I signed a three year deal with them that allowed me to build a team of developers and we built them a solution.  We now had more services to sell to customers.\\"<br /><br />Rule #6.  Say YES!  He started out just connecting merchants with a credit card processor.  Then OpenTable asked him to do software development even though he's never developed software before.  He said YES!  He got software developers, built a great product, and at least quadrupled his income.  His decision to say YES! elevated his business to a whole new level, not just in the services he offered customers but in how they perceived him.  Suddenly, word of mouth was spreading and other online companies started using Braintree's services: Airbnb, Uber, etc.  And the VCs started calling because all of their clients were saying Braintree was providing all of their payment services.  It's not that easy for startup online companies to get payment services.<br /><br />Bryan told me, \\"When I first started, for each new customer we'd put together an entire package for our credit card processor on why we thought the customer could be trusted and would be a legitimate merchant.\\" Which leads to...<br /><br />Rule #7. Customer Service.  You can treat each customer, new and old, like a real human being.  \\"We intuitively sort of knew what we didn't like in customer service everywhere else: automated calling trees, slow response times, poor problem solving, etc.  So we made sure there was as little friction as possible between the customer contacting us and actually getting their problem solved.\\"  When you are a small business, there's no excuse for having poor customer service.  Your best new customers are your old customers, and the best way to touch your old customers is to provide quick help when they need it.  Customer services is the most reliable touch point to keep selling your service to them.<br /><br />\\"Ok,\\" I said, \\"I have to ask.  At what point were you making over seven figures?\\"<br /><br />By Year 2, Bryan was making over a million dollars and the business was doubling every year.  They couldn't hire fast enough.<br /><br />In 2011, after four years in business, Braintree took in its first dime of investment capital--$34 million in Series A funding round.  Two years later, according to Crunchbase, they process over $8 billion in credit card transactions annually.<br /><br />Not bad for someone who quit his job and just wanted to figure out a way to get his bills paid.<br /><br />So what does this mean for you?<br /><br />I get BS e-mails all the time.  \\"Make a million dollars buying gold!\\"  \\"Make a million dollars in real estate!\\"  \\"Here are the secrets to making a million dollars, revealed this one time only!\\" Then I click on the link and it's all BS.  Vague answers, some testimonials and then you have to buy a package.  It's all BS.  The rest of this chapter is about brainstorming specific ways to make a million dollars, to do what Bryan Johnson did in less than two years.  This is all just brainstorming mind you, and it comes from my personal experience and expertise, so there will be limitations on its scope.  But it's a start.  It's where I start when I want to come up with a new business idea.  It's where you can start, too.  Note: every idea I mention below is an idea I've seen someone pursue to make a million dollars or more.  Am I recommending these methods? No.  But, again, they are starting points for brainstorming.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|I wish they had season 3 available! :(  It figures I start watching this right after I cut the cord. Constant suspense and changing stories.  The beginning was a little odd how it started...Like you missed something.  Once you get into it...You forget all about that. :)
B003PBB4ME|5.0|I used this item in combination with my t4i. Great combination for low shots since you can swivel the screen of the t4i and use this to follow your subject. All in all no complains here.
B00CLT31D6|2.0|I found this book was outdated and no longer really as relevant. Also it pushed strongly at saving the ultimate goal as opposed to any quality of life or enjoyment.
B0092MKTL2|5.0|For a group thats new, they raised the standard of the music industry in one album, and each song just pushes that level of amazement further and further. I'd recommend this album to everyone and anyone looking for a new band to listen to and those that aren't will still be stunned by the end of the first song.
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|THIS IS SO SIMPLE, REALLY.  CAN'T STOP LISTENING TO THIS CD OVER AND OVER.  BEST ADVICE I CAN OFFER.....JUST GET IT NOW!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I love my Kindle. Great use is made of it. Games are played, books are read, keep up with my Facebook friends and do a lot of searches when watching TV. Really enjoy the device. It has a lot of convenience for me.
B00932A4XE|2.0|trite, boring, not funny, I don't know what else to say.  I actually liked J.Lo's other pregnant movie, you know where she falls in love right after she tries to get pregnant by artificial insemination.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I hate to speak to soon the last time I did that the wait times went from 30 min to7 hrs I don't want that to happen on this game because it is really a lot of fun
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Lots of fun. I enjoy playing it very much. I haven't gotten very far but hope there are many levels to play.
B000DZ7V7W|2.0|I tried, I really tried to like this album.  It came highly recommended but, wow, this is one self-indulgent ear bore.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|A great game if you dont mind spending a lot of time to gather friends to get hearts to try and convert to crystals. Unfortunately after installing onto my new kindle I started getting errors in the message area saying that the string was not found. I figured that it wasn't a big deal and ignored it. But when I went to open the game three days ago it flashed white with &quot;string not found&quot; and would crash before I could get in. I'm hoping that there will be a patch, but knowing gameloft there will not be. They seem to dislike kindle users.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Very well done. For me it needs to be read again. A time line would be most helpful to get an overall picture.
B005K17RU0|2.0|Was an ok app; got me the info I needed but not amazing. After the most recent updates it now crashes all of the time. Will be trying some others out now and not coming back.
B0091V6TF4|5.0|I often work at night and on weekends spending many hours at a time at the computer and have had the chance to listen through this CD many times now on headphones.  I enjoy every track with the exception on one called &#34;Do You Know How Christmas Trees are Grown?&#34;.  Nothing against Christmas - I love the Christmas time of year, but the track just doesn't fit the Bond vibe.  Maybe it was in the Bond film &#34;On Her Majesty's Secret Service&#34;.  I have never seen that movie and I had never heard the song.  The track is a woman singing with a children's choir.<br /><br />Other than that both CD's are solid.  If you love Bond, you'll like this CD.
B0071MDA2U|4.0|I feel like the series was one of the best I've ever read. But the ending was such a turnoff. I mean, I want to know what happens next. You can't just leave me hanging like that Lauren Oliver!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|You will like this version if you are a fan of the other versions of Angry Birds.<br />The \\"advertising\\" is less intrusive.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|The final book, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest, will leave you sitting on the edge of your seat racing to finish the end of the book. You will be satisfied with the final installment of  The Millennium Trilogy and you'll find yourself pondering the actions of and choices of the character's long after you've completed your reading.
B001ILFUDC|4.0|It plays, no scratches, no problems.  New in unopened package is always best, but used can be a bargain if the condition is still good.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|It is clearly one of his earliest, as his style is somewhat repetitive.  His plot was quite engaging and the twist caught me by surprise, however, which is always a good thing in a mystery.  I felt Brown repeated the story line/explanation of an event/phenomena a bit too often, but was provided for various characters and an okay emphasis for the reader. The denouement was followed by a rather extensive closure - much of which was a bit laborious. I was ready for the book to end.  Good read, however - a typical Brown page-turner and worth your time.  Dr. O
1933492910|5.0|this artbook is really gorgeous!beautiful colours and shapes of fantastic and real animals!it opens the mind t onew words!!Terryl is a real magician of drawing!!!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|A must try<br />game , great if you love spot the difference type games and platform games as you can unlock scenes and levels
B004V9MU86|5.0|It's a wonderful novel and a must read. Full of charm and beautiful imagery that will keep you captivated throughout the journey.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I am a now retired elementary teacher and have known for a long time that some children have some really deep thoughts that most adults completely disregard as thoughts that are copied from an adult or worse yet that the thoughts are cute but of course children can not possibly know what is really said. The kids that were different or just didn't relate well to other kids in general often times were fascinating to talk to one on one, if they would let you in.  This book took what I know about children and their native intelligence to the nth degree.  Some of the battle descriptions were a bit long for me ,but I did really enjoy this book.
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|I didn't think I'd like it. I looked over this movie many times cause it looked boring. But I actually enjoyed it.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I watched once and was hooked. I even purchased all three seasons. Makes you aware that people really do care about one another, regardless of their lot in life.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this 'Bond/Fleming' romp! Took me back to my teenage years when I read a ton of WW2 paperbacks. I also love the 40s feel of the style of writing, the right dialogue, the clothing descriptions and the 'Bond'-stretching-of-technology. Great little read, I hope there's more like this to come. Where's my medium dry martini, shaken not stirred?
B00ADLCC9I|5.0|I truly believe that I made a great decision in making this purchase! Worth the money spent; a great gift!
B00005JMYI|4.0|classic lines....some dialogue is worth memorizing.  GREAT stuff to inject into some conversations. The entire cast is brilliant together. Can't wait for the upcoming sequel.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great story. Great writing. Start reading and you won't be able to put it down. Hugh Howey can claim a seat at the table of the masters.
B004EPYZV2|5.0|this one's a keeper....quality product, delivered on time, very good price.  Quite satisfied with this purchase...as done....and with the delivered product.
1452000247|5.0|Peter, A Darkened Fairy Tale, is richly imaginative and inventive on a scale not seen since Alice in Wonderland, of which in this book there are whiffs and hints, but this is not a carefree jaunt down the Yellow Brick Road, no; this delicious witch's cauldron of delights owes as much to the Brothers Grimm as it does to L. Frank Baum. There is good here, but evil as well,  and there are dark forebodings that things might not end well for everyone involved.  This is a book for children, the sort of children who enjoy being scared, who like telling ghost stories or reading Tales of the Crypt under the covers with a flashlight. There is joy to be had, but also nightmares. There are fairies and elves, but also tombstones and bone-chilling fear. Kids will love it, and so will many grown-ups.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This game is a good game it also a little bit hard you have to use your brain a lot
B00846REIS|4.0|This was a good read however it was not in the same class as 50 shades like most reviews state. This book takes on more complex issues with the main subjects.  I wish the writer had gone into more detail.  Enjoyed the book and look forward to the tv series.
1401937519|5.0|Read it myself, but passed it along to a friend with Cancer, the greatest therapy you can give yourself is yourself.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Not the same as the one you get on the iPhone but okay. It is handy for a quick glance for your local weather.
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|Really liked the story and the characters. While there are parts that you must seriously suspend your disbelief this is a work a fiction so it is to b  expected. Very much looking forward to reading the rest of the Harry Hole novels
B001NLL93W|4.0|This book is the strongest book yet. I'm curious to see where they go now since all the obstacles seem to be overcome.
B004RJMUJO|3.0|Great game but once you reach higher levels, it seems to slow down and hang, often enough that UI avoid playing this game.  Cell phone is a Moto Defy and should have enough basic requirements
B000JMKTLO|5.0|WOW! What a book! I could hardly put it down.  I also liked her other two books and can't wait for the next one.
B005LAIH4A|3.0|This is a decent movie.  The story is a little weird, but Dr. Seuss is a little weird, so no surprise.  My favorite part is the song at the very beginning of the movie.
B009I2UH2W|1.0|This charger didn't work when I tried to use it.  The logo lights up to show that it is receiving power, but it does not charge my phone.  Very disappointed.
B003UESJF6|3.0|It is funny and entertaining, but my kids seem to lose interest in it after a little while, so I gave only 3 stars.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|This movie has been on my watchlist for quite some time because I thought it would have not been worth my time... To my surprise it grabbed my full attention from beginning till end, it is a very enjoyable movie....awesome characters!!! I shed little tears in some scenes (don't judge me) and in some I burst out laughing...
B001DPHDCY|4.0|It is a pretty good movie.  Most kids will enjoy it; it is very colorful and creative.  Buy it now!
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|Second review: My review after having watched the film for the first time is given below. My review after having watched it a second time is given now. This time around I was definitely able to follow the stories better, athough there's still a lot of stuff I'm not getting. Some things I noticed: the scientist dies in the same way as his lover was killed decades earlier; many of the characters are reading books written by characters from previous ages, but they are missing the second half of the book until later when they are able to find the second half and understand the completion of the story which then enables them to complete their own life stories. The message of the film seems to be that reincarnation exists, that there are always certain elements (souls?) that are evil-doers, that there is an eternal battle between good people and the evil doers, and that a person's life story is not complete when he or she dies, it continues when they are reincarnated in the next life.   Looking at my first review, now I disagree with my first impression about Joseph Campbell - this second time around I'm not seeing him anywhere. ... The Bridge Across Forever is still apparent, perhaps it was one of the inspirations for the film.   It's going to take a third viewing to get more out of it!   FIRST REVIEW: interesting. First impressions: Bridge Across Forever, Joseph Campbell, a bit of &#34;Canticle for Liebowitz&#34;, the rise and fall of civilizations, the dark sides of human nature. At times inspiring, at other times disturbing. Those are my impressions having watched the movie once. I am basically still in the dark as to how the stories and characters relate to eachother except on the most apparent level. I think to figure this out will require multiple viewings and paying close attention to the dialogue, or maybe reading the book. There are many things that remain unexplained or inexplicable. Also there are many events and actions that are disjointed - I assume these become clear upon further analysis rather than shortcomings or flaws in the writing itself? Overall, an interesting view, it makes you think about the fundamental problems of human nature, about whether there is such a thing as soulmates. Reminds one of books like The Name of The Rose or Dictionary of the Khazars. Definitely homage was paid to movies like Bladerunner (the post-apocalyptic urban street scenes, for example) and there are parallels with the movie &#34;The Island&#34; where the androids are misled to believe they are going to a higher place when in fact they are being recycled.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Cannot wait for the next book in the series to come out. These two writers can tell a story like no one else.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Pretty decent time killer, although I'm wary of the various permission complaints about this one. Pick it up if it is free, but I wouldn't pay for it.
B004LROUNG|5.0|This was a good story, from a great story teller. I really enjoyed this book. I could not put it down.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|This is so fun I love it a lot . You should get it to see if u like it
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Great deal on the entire set of HP movies. I boght them before we went on summer vacation and it passed the time in the car.  My kids love them!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|While somewhat minimal, it does exactly what it promises and excels at it. I've switched almost entirely from an amalgam of Apple TV + Xbox to just the Chromecast. As a heavy Android user, it was a relief to finally have some sort of unified experience. The fractured media management landscape was a thorn in my side which I'm happy to be rid of, even if it does not alter my life radically for the better.<br /><br />One unexpected perk is that the Chromecast can switch on your TV and switch over to its port whenever you activate it on your phone or computer. I'm told any HDMI above a certain spec can do this, but none of my other electronics have taken advantage of this feature.<br /><br />Chromecast is a platform, so it's not limited to the initial offering though, as of this review, no more big names have officially come out and said they are developing for the Chromecast SDK. In all fairness, I'm not sure that it's finalized. Hopefully the large number of sales are tantalizing enough to gain widespread support for the device.<br /><br />If you've been reading review around the internet, much has been made about the fact that, in practice, the dongle has a couple attachments you'll probably need for the device to work (such as USB power), but if you have anything more than a very small HDMI television, you probably won't have much issue with aesthetics. If you have a television with the very latest HDMI spec, the dongle will work in the way it looks in advertisements.<br /><br />My main complaint is that it has no Hulu support yet, but I'm not docking stars since that wasn't promised. I'd also like to display my own pictures and local video, though it seems an official solution to the latter is in the works. Hopefully content providers will recognize the Android market is pretty big now, and that they could make a fair bit of money by supporting the device.
B004XANKVO|5.0|I brought this backpack after having a few Swiss Gear bags which were okay. This bag is great for a traveler who often ends up on unexpected trips. I currently hold two laptops, an iPad, tons of work gear, and a full change of clothes. The hard case for glasses is perfect and the stuff it area is great for undressing at the airport security lines. Great sturdy bag. No complaints.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I really love this game. It has four different locations to run through and it's addicting and fun to play.
B0000844M8|5.0|It was as terrific as I had remembered<br />it.  I wanted my grandchild to see it<br />and she loved the movie
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love it, play it all the time totally hooked. Great game and good for passing the time away. A must for anyone.
0062255657|2.0|I'm at 90% of this book and I don't think I'm gonna finish it... I have read Neil Gaiman's incredible and seminal comic series Sandman, a masterpiece few would have the cohones to disagree with me about (multiple times). I've also read \\"Smoke & Mirrors\\", a great collection of short stories he wrote years ago. This one just doesn't hold up. To me, these themes are rehashed, he's written about the theme of the three-ladies in past works, and the characters just aren't interesting or deep... he really hasn't done much to develop the personalities if the characters here and that just causes me to not really care about them or why they feel/do they way that they do. Then again, I wasn't astounded by The Graveyard book or Coraline either. I would honestly say that there is a big difference in quality and imagination between the (adult fantasy) comic books he has written and his books.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have been with horses for over 30 years and I love this game. The only downside is all the unnecessary other games advertisements. They most time freezes everything up and are very annoying. But I love the 3d feel of the game. Despite the annoyance of advertising if you are a horse lover this game you 'll take to heart.
B009AY04A8|3.0|It's a fun object hunt game and would probably have a good story line if I wasn't bored out of my mind with the one-line back and fourth dialogue between the characters.
B004SOR4H6|3.0|I signed up to follow some writers during the Egyptian revolution last year.  have really not used it since.  maybe more in the future.
020530902X|5.0|The Elements of Style by William Strunk, Jr. is the definitive text and classic manual on the principles of English language.

The book gives technical, but practical, guidelines to great writing with examples of each 'rule' so writers can write so readers will read.  This book should be on every writer's desk.<br /><br />I give The Elements of Style by William Strunk, Jr. a 5-star rating and recommend it for anyone who wants to write in a clear and  concise manner - regardless which genre you choose to express your thoughts and imagination.<br /><br />Review by: Rita Kroon, author of &#34;Kiss Your Mommy Goodbye&#34; and &#34;Discover God Through His Attributes&#34;

B00127RAJY|5.0|What a workout!  I really loved the first workout best.  Not just because of difficulty, but it included moves that I was very comfortable with.  Once you move up to workouts 2 and 3, they are really intense, but it also includes a lot of movements that were new to me.  After I got a hang of the new movements, 2 and 3 were much more fun because I wasn't always trying to figure out how to correctly do the workout.
B00A2BTCTC|5.0|It's RUSH, so of course it's going to be good.  Everything about this was worth the purchase price.  If you are a RUSH fanatic, this purchase will be very well worth it to you too!

B003Y3MYYU|5.0|To briefly restate some common points of enthusiasm: this is an electric, fast-paced and so particularly dramatically effective performance of The Ring. I would join with those who recommend it as a first set, together with Stewart Spencer's careful modern translation (\\"Wagner's Ring of the Nibelung\\"), as this set does not come with a libretto.<br /><br />I want mainly to alert would-be buyers to the fact that this recording has been remastered, and is available (at least) on Amazon.uk (ASIN: B00AX20AHI) in a 12-cd boxset for even less than this 14-cd edition here in the U.S.

159514188X|5.0|I read this book a couple of years ago and thought it was brilliant because I had never read a book that was so unique and sad and true, but now I am a bit more savvy and can say that I can understand those who might hate it. The novel narrates a girl's reasons (thirteen of them) for committing suicide through a boy listening to a series of voice recordings on cassettes she had sent before killing herself. It explained the true stories behind all the rumors that had surrounded her life in high school including friend betrayals, rape, and simple misunderstandings. By the end the reader might feel completely depressed but it's definitely a must-read for those who like these ideas I've stated so far.

B00D9PUXQY|5.0|For the last few years, DevilDriver has been a band capable of writing some outstanding songs, but not quite remaining consistent over the course of full albums.  \\"Pray for Villains\\" was hit-or-miss, and \\"Beast\\", while a step in the right direction, had two or three songs that I didn't care much for.  On \\"Winter Kills\\", the band has mastered the craft of piecing all of the elements of their sound together in a consistently flowing, diverse arrangement of metal that keeps crushing heaviness as its underpinning.  From the outset with opener \\"Oath of the Abyss\\", they establish the intention of changing gears within songs much more frequently than the last couple albums.  Continuing through the next two songs, \\"Ruthless\\" and \\"Desperate Times\\", DevilDriver showcases all of their different styles of playing, moving through sections of groove, thrash, melodic modern metal, and hints of death metal with seamless transitions.  But, more than just a collection of parts, each song sounds cohesively tied together by a strong chorus or hook.<br /><br />As the album progresses into the title track, the band begins utilizing more melody, moving gradually from crushing to melancholy, but never sacrificing a trace of heaviness.  Then, around the middle of the album on track 5, \\"The Appetite\\", DevilDriver really show what they're capable of.  This song, in my opinion, also would have made a great title track, as it offers the best of everything DD has to offer.  It's an epic track that slowly pulls the album back into the stomp of the first few songs along with some surprising NWOBHM-inspired soloing, and should come off great in the live set.  From here on out, beginning with the powerful grind of \\"Gutted\\",  \\"Winter Kills\\" stays consistently and satisfyingly heavy, avoiding some of the weaker sections of \\"Villains\\" and \\"Beast\\" for a very strong finish to a thoroughly badass album.  The one exception might be the final song, \\"Sail\\", a cover from Awolnation (not familiar with the band or song) that Dez was reportedly introduced to by his sons.  Its forlorn feel concludes the album by going back to that melancholy tone, but it's an effective place for the song, as it would interrupt the flow of the other tracks if it had been placed anywhere else.<br /><br />In addition to these highlights, Dez sounds fantastic.  This might be my favorite vocal performance of his I've heard in DevilDriver.  I hear him using more of the familiar grunt/growl from the Coal Chamber days and less straight screaming....but still a lot of screaming.  He's really clear on these songs while staying completely intense.  Other than that, I think the solos sound better than usual, the drumming is phenomenal, and they play around a little more with soft intros and outros to get some dynamics between songs.  The two bonus tracks are solid, but not quite as strong as the rest, so they showed good judgment choosing the final track listing for the official album.  I think this band has hit a high mark with \\"Winter Kills\\" and finally shown real mastery of all the aspects of their sound.  Job well done.or song) that Dez was reportedly introduced to by his sons.

It was funny, and well-written. I don't regret a second that I decided to read it, it's worth it. And I am sure I will be going back to re-read some of the scenes. I HIGHLY recommend it.

8866135879|5.0|The point of a planner is to keep you organized but it only works if you actually use it. This planner is small enough that I will actually carry it around in my backpack, but it is still large enough that I have plenty of space to write. I really like that it starts in July so you can buy it now and begin using it before the 1st of the year. It's quality construction and has a clean, unisex design. It comes with a little booklet that slips into the back for extra notes if you want that and also some stickers if you're into those. Basically everything you would want in planner in a convenient, compact package. For something that you're going to use all year it's definitely worth $15.

B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I had this book in hardback and once I got my Kindle I donated all the hardbacks to charity.  I love this book so much I re-bought it on Kindle.  Once you start reading you won't be able to put it down.  Because it is written by a person of middle-eastern descent, I believe it is accurate.  And if accurate it is terrifying.
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|I watched this on a plane and thought &#34;I'd like to see it with my wife sometime&#34; but after seeing it again I did not know what I was thinking!  It's not a feel-good, watch-it-again kind of movie.  The believability of the storyline starts to wane quickly if you think about it some, and the &#34;there's someone better for you out there&#34; message is not something our depleted marriage culture needs to hear!

B00EOO55GW|5.0|I'm a long time fan of Avenged Sevenfold.  I started listening to them in 2005 when I bought \\"City of Evil.\\"  I'd have to say every album is different to the next.  I also have to mention that none of them were amazing at first but took a week or two of listening to grow on me.  I know this sounds ludicrous but I didn't think \\"Nightmare\\" was good on the day it came out.  After listening to it for a week I figured out that the album was truly special.  I know this album will be like that.  My one and only problem with the album is I don't like classic metal but I'm looking past that knowing I'll love this album shortly.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is great and very entertaining to play. This a great game worthy of 5 stars. I love to play it.
B008JFUQ3O|5.0|I really loved the original movie, and I was skeptical about the release of a sequel. However, it was well worth seeing! The humor was spot on, and while there isn't as much focus on the heartwarming elements or relationship development, there's enough to satisfy and keep you entertained. I don't think there's any limit on what ages can watch and enjoy this film.<br /><br />It really was adorable, and I'm definitely looking forward to owning it on DVD as soon as it comes out!
B000VWGYHU|4.0|The first thought that came to mind when I first listened to this album; for me, the most anticipated rap album ever; was, \\"What happened?\\" I praised Eminem for the lyrical skills he so effortlessly displayed on his Slim Shady debut, but this follow-up brings with it a certain level of disappointment. The verses simply don't measure-up to the standard of excellence he's set for himself.<br /><br />While the rapper hasn't fallen off completely, he's now content surrounding classic bars with what in comparison amounts to filler. I'm Back, on which he commits the musical blunder of singing the chorus in the melody of the beat, has him wasting precious time in a pool of babble. The words rhyme, but what he says is a lot less interesting than anything he had to say on The Slim Shady LP.<br /><br />Suddenly going from an unknown rapper to the most popular rapper in the world, thus made an easy target for prudes who don't believe in free speech, has apparently affected his creativity. There's still a zany emphasis on drugs and violence, but he's much more focused on taunting critics and harmless peers, like Britney Spears and Christopher Reeve, than composing a clever verse.<br /><br />Still, Eminem at his corniest or most boring; The Way I Am is a snoozer for me; is better than most rappers. And when he manages to tap into his Shady LP greatness for whole songs, as on the Stan and Kim narratives, they stand as his best. Best verse? Under The Influence or the last verse on Criminal. Both are brilliant. The point is that the brilliance on this album is spotty.<br /><br />If you've never heard of Eminem before and you're smart enough to know that he's just joking when he drops a line about lifting Christopher Reeve's legs, this album should impress. But if you go back and listen to The Slim Shady LP, you'll realize that Eminem's raps were a lot more impressive when the spotlight was focused on his alter-ego as opposed to The Real Slim Shady.<br /><br />marcellee.com

B005PZ87WI|5.0|I still miss Gideon, but Rossi has grown on me.  It helps that in this season, his character's generosity is explored further.  Honestly, I look forward to CM being available on Amazon prime.  For the entire 7th season, we ended up buying all 23 episodes at $1.99 each - so yes, it was a little pricey but that was the only way we could afford it (we watched it over a span of 2 months), instead of paying $40+ off the bat, for a season that we may end up not enjoying.<br /><br />Enjoy it, we did!  Each episode is so well written, with enough nerdy material, humor, suspense and tragedy.  Some material is disturbing, especially if you picture it happening to yourself and your family.  But as they say, it is better to be aware of how random crime and people can be, rather than be gullible.<br /><br />Thumbs up to the screenwriters, producers, directors and cast!  Loved it and recommend it.

B007THA4FI|3.0|J K Rowling is one of the great writers working today. She develops her story line with care and ingenuity. Her sentence structure is beautiful.  However for me the simultaneity of the story lines and the intertwining of her characters is a chore to handle especially since my reading vehicle is a kindle.<br />It took me at least two-thirds of the book to relax and enjoy the beautiful prose, come to know her characters. and become friends with the plot.<br />However, I must say&#34; It was well worth the trouble&#34;.  I look forward to wadding through her next offering.

1401233066|4.0|While not the best in the series, SUPER TEAM was still a respectable installment.  The Fables community is at the end of their rope, with the Dark Man threatening to overcome their last stronghold.  Under the leadership of Ozma, and under the influence of Pinocchio, the leaders of Fabletown determine to make a final stand against the Dark Man as a troupe of comic-book-style superheroes.  There are some amusing moments as the Super Team is interviewed, selected, and garbed, but these mostly just serve as a distraction from the very dangerous situations arising.  The North Wind gets a whiff of his son's till-now secret child, Ghost, and cannot abide such a being living free.  Beast's and Beauty's beautiful new baby may be more than it seems.  Nurse Pratt finally gets what she wants from the Dark Man (and I'm sure we haven't seen the last of her).  And all the while the final showdown with the Dark Man is nearing.<br /><br />Some reviewers have complained of the rather sudden end to the Dark Man storyline, and I'll agree that it happened quickly and took me by surprise.  At the same time, I was happy to see the end of the villain, and thought the way it was accomplished (both in the story, and by the writers) was great.  Unexpected and imaginative, which is exactly what we should expect in Fables.  While that thread is hopefully concluded, there is still a lot going on in the Fables universe, and I greatly anticipate the continued adventures.  The next volume, [[ASIN:1401235166 Inherit the Wind]], appears to focus on who will take on the mantle of the North Wind.  That should be a nice change of pace for the story, hopefully getting back to more of a personal drama about our favorite fables.

140006922X|3.0|In the interests of full disclosure, I was raised in a conservative Protestant family but have been an unenthusiastic atheist since I was a teenager. I have maintained an admiration for the humanist teachings of Jesus and a keen interest in the historical Jesus - about whom so little is known, apart from the Gospels. Unfortunately, Aslan (ironic name, huh, C.S. Lewis?) doesn't add much. He mainly re-translates and re-interprets the Gospels. He does question the view of Jesus as a peacemaker, rather than the revolutionary Aslan assumes he is (I would share his view on that).<br /><br />My problem with Aslan's interpretation is that while he analyzes and discounts much of what the New Testament claims about Jesus, he also swallows whole anything the Old Testament claims - Aslan, there's really very little in the way of historical fact to be verified about ANYTHING in the Old Testament. So it is difficult for the reader to accept Aslan's partial debunking when he doesn't appear to want to debunk the Old Testament, which is ripe for the debunking.<br /><br />Though Aslan paints an historically accurate picture of the political climate prevailing in Jesus' time (brutal Roman occupation, a plethora of would-be messiahs wandering the wilderness, revolutionary Jews), so does Monty Python in \\"Life of Brian\\" (those guys didn't waste their Oxbridge educations) - which is a lot shorter (and a lot funnier).

B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  It agrees with a lot of my own conclusions about scripture, especially the contrivances of the gospel authors and their copiers.  It tweaks one's faith, especially this wobbling Catholic's, to see more evidence of Jesus's siblings, for instance.  I was annoyed by his repeated reference to John the Baptist as the master of Jesus - that is a stretch.  He does take his own opinions a bit farther than the data should allow at other times, and he gets repetitive at the end, but I felt his command of the topic was good, his writing style easy to read and comprehend, and there is a lot to think about.  A good book for the open-minded people of any faith anywhere.

B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|The disc was action packed. I do know that the description of the character in the book is different from the actor but TC did a good job.
B001XRLWPQ|3.0|What brought me to this series was Nathan Fillion, who I had first seen in Firefly. He's a likable actor and I was curious to see him in another show. This show is a mixture of Murder She Wrote and Moonlighting, both enjoyable 80's mystery/crime series. Here, the \\"whodunits\\" are pretty transparent and aren't as interesting as the developing relationship between Castle and Detective Becket. Unfortunately, Fillion and Katic have some chemistry but not enough to keep me invested.<br /><br />I can see how the fantasy world of a successful writer with a perfect daughter would appeal to people looking to kick back and relax, but it's really unfortunate that the better TV series Firefly was cancelled after 14 episodes while this show continues into its sixth season.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|Of course i read it due to the tv series, but i really enjoyed the tie in.... the characters are a little one dimensional as we know the characters already from tv but I really liked the plot.
B009POCG5Y|5.0|I loved this movie in the theater and the BluRay watching it again was just as good. It's a great story. Clint Eastwood plays a great part, it seems to be him, being him.  I loaned it to several friends and everyone loved it! Even my Dad who is also having vision issues.  Sit back and enjoy, it's not just a baseball movie, or a movie about aging, it's a good movie for all.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|.... so based on that, I would recommend this to a fellow fan.  The fights are good, the effects are good, the writing is ok - especially if you like those cheesy b-type movies - and the acting was ok as well.
1452000247|5.0|Peter: A Darkened Fairly Tale  is a richly woven tapestry of dark and light, of magic good and bad, of life and death. It sparkles with wit and inventiveness on a scale not seen since Alice in Wonderland, of which the are hints and whiffs, but this is no light-hearted trek through the land of Oz; no, this delicious witch's cauldron sends up the dank and shivery odor of the Brothers Grimm, as well.  This is a tale of good and evil, of power and impotence, of delight and fear. There is as much Poe here as Baum.  This is a book for children--the sort of children who read Tales of the Crypt under the blanket with a flashlight.  It is not for the very young or faint of heart; there are nightmare here, in this strange land in another dimension, and there is a foreboding that all may not turn out well. With all of that, it is the sort of book children love. They love being scared, and if this book doesn't do it, nothing will!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Our eyes have always been glued to TV.... It is absolutely a Classic. Best Drama on TV in recent memory...
B0054SMIH6|5.0|I'm a Matthew McConaughey fan anyway, but he wasn't the only good actor in this movie. I loved the story, the plot, the relationship between him and his ex-wife.. everything.
1423140605|5.0|omg! i didn't see that ending coming, can't wait for the fourth book!<br />i think this is the best book of the series so far because all the<br />characters get together for the new quest so there's more points of view
B000NMW6M0|3.0|I wasn't super impressed by this movie. I love several of the actors, but I felt that the movie itself could have been more detailed. I did, however, like how all characters tied together in some way and you were able to put the pieces together as the movie progressed.
1423141997|5.0|i love percy so i was thrilled when i read this book and percy was back<br />the new characters are quite interesting too
B007C94XG4|5.0|Kids loved it!  They watched it multiple times.  I highly recommend it  - my kids are 5 to 8 years old.
1423113462|5.0|i'm a big fan of the percy jackson series, so i was so happy when this book was released<br />but it wasn't exactly what i expected, i really didn't like piper and jason but i did love leo<br />and the story line is interesting enough to keep you reading
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Don't usually read Fantasy Novels, so glad I decided to read this book based on other reviews. You will become hooked all the way from beginning to end.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The acting is wonderful..have watched on my tv..catching up on whatever I missed...even better on kindle...all the costuming details are up close and personal...I am enjoying it twice as much on kindle..
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Loved this FREE app!  Not only is it accurate, it's so easy to set and operate - so much easier than my radio/CD/alarm clock (too many buttons- have had it for years and still am not sure how to operate the darn thing!).  Highly recommend this app!
0451232852|5.0|What a great book!  Ken Follett is a master of the sweeping saga.  I am mesmerized by the interplay of attitudes and actions from person to person, class to class, and country to country.  The characters' thoughts and interactions make the march of history more understandable.How often does the fate of millions of people and scores of nations hinge on reactions to a tiny incident!  The meetings and partings of the members of the five main families also demonstrate how how small the world really is (and how the choices of each of us really do matter).  I am nearly finished reading, and can't put this book down.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|After you get the hang of it, it's pretty fun. Takes awhile to build up coins if you don't spend any money, but it's worth downloading especially since it's free. I think most people will enjoy this game.
B006AN78XS|3.0|Woody Allen creates a nostalgic world that causes you to fall in love with Paris in this critically beloved film. Check out our detailed review of this film [...]
B002GMSMHS|4.0|It's sad that a four year old camera needs a special order of picture card. The product is good, but expensive, and took a while to get here when ordered.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I have been playing Bingo Blitz for almost a year now and I love it!! Can't wait each day for my bingo credits! Currently on leavel 74..
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it so much I want more a lot .more make more updates. please! I love the game so much !
0316228583|4.0|From the reviews here on Amazon I expected to throw this back. We all know J.K. Rowling (Harry Potter) can tell a great story, but the average for this one was only 3 stars. I think that's an injustice!! Once again, though, it maybe a case of the book being better on audio. Tom Hollander is a great voice for this story. Rowling's story begins when Parish [Town] Councilor Barry Fairbrother dies in the Country Club parking lot of natural causes in his wife's arms. This then creates a \\"casual vacancy\\" on the Council. What happens next is WHY the Bible tells us God keeps vengeance strictly for himself!!<br /><br />An ensemble cast of characters who are vividly drawn and well-developed tell the rest of the story, though it is not told in first person. Each person has an inner ax to grind or an unrequited passion to live out. The teenagers, the law partners, the Deli Owner and his wife, the addict Mom in the projects (\\"Council Housing\\" in the UK) and her very vulnerable little boy as well as the dissatisfied wife of one of the attorneys, the spurned girlfriend who has ruined her life moving to the village--it's quite a cast. The story shows how gossip, ridicule and hatred build and ruin lives. It is an excellent moral tale without being a \\"moral tale.\\" I highly recommend it. This is not a Miss Read story though. It is very, very gritty. Personally, I hope there's a sequel!!  The Casual Vacancy by J.K. Rowling.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|first time I've read this author and I must say that I really enjoyed it, one of those that you couldn't put down, a great read start to finish, thought I had it all figured out, but didn't even come close!!!
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Glad I didnt see it in the theater it was an ok rental<br />It could have been better<br />Once you understand what is going on it is very predictable
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|Fast-moving, suspenseful, not entirely pre-dictable. After reading several Nikki Heat books, I find she wears well. We keep discovering new things about her character.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My 3 and 6 year old love this game, even better that it was FREE! Glad we saw it and downloaded :)
B005IEGUDY|4.0|It is a momentous accomplishment - the scope truly awesome.  I really enjoyed the pre-history treatment but found that the pace dragged a bit as it advanced. I read it many years ago and had felt the same way.  On the whole, an enjoyable experience.
B007AL48UK|4.0|Like the graphics, very clear for use on a kindle.<br />It had several games to choose from.<br />All related to summer.
B00E6F155E|5.0|Not exactly POV,same concert though, some video is out, a few more songs are in, great, GREAT show, PG at the height his powers. This concert could be better than Secret World Live. Not as monumental a presentation, but perhaps more profound and expressive. Total ownership of the audience. The usual suspects in that era band: Levin, Rhodes, Katché, Sancious, all rock.<br /><br />The video is excellent, the sound great, quite nice surround. I'm speaking of the DVD, included in the 25th anniversary edition of So, the Blu Ray is bound to exceed that quality. I'm jealous because this BR release diminishes the exclusivity of the long awaited re-release of POV (sort of) in modern media, which came in the So Box Set, but that's your gain. On the other hand, I saw it 10 months ago so we're even.<br /><br />Highly recommended, one of the great Showmasters of Rock, one of the best concert movies ever.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I enjoyed occupying this dreamland.  Is there a circus like it somewhere out there?  I would be the first to enter its fascinating tents and allow myself to be taken away to a magical place.  What excitement from the real world humdrum.<br /><br />Thank you, Erin!!
B005544V6A|5.0|Perfect combo of swagger and smarts. Pretty good direction and cinematography. Casting on the spot. This is show is character driven not so much plot-driven.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It was a page turner, making me wonder what really happened to Amy.  But I was most disappointed by the ending.  Author seemed to drop the ball entirely.  So many possible endings, and the author just bailed completely.
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|I like various forms of Mahjong. However, this app would download okay,but would not run on my LG Thrill. :(
B00ECU2SGS|5.0|I'd never heard of this before, so I assumed it was a &#34;B&#34; movie.  One night my girlfriend and I were looking for something to watch and we figured we'd give it a shot.  This is a really good move, with a great story line that keeps you interested!
0446613444|5.0|I have read all the Harry Bosch novels and savored them all. I liked the Harry Bosch character and how he approached the life of crime.
B00DGN51O8|2.0|I'm normally totally immersed in any movie I watch.  After 5 minutes I turned on my tablet and started surfing the net.  I think my girlfriend was jealous that I had something else to do, she suffered through the whole thing with her daughter.  Not a great movie, not a great story.  The best part was the retard half of the 2 headed giant, he was just funny and now my gf gets a kick out of talking like him!
B001VLXNLU|5.0|Totally awesome read for me. Enjoyed the whole series, cannot hardly wait until the next book in this series comes out.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Stock fan on i5 processor was not cutting it.  When gaming, seeing temps in the 90's (which is a bit hot).  The Hyper 212 Plus did the trick, dropping temps by 20-30 degrees, easy, even under load.  And, it is very quiet...really just a whisper.  This cooler does require you to install a backplate. which is Ok by me.  Intel's push-pin mounted fans are a pretty poor design in my opinion, prone to popping off or otherwise unseating themselves.<br />Mounting was easy enough.  Yes, had to remove the motherboard, but everything after that was pretty easy. I will say that the instructions are pretty awful.  But, this wasn't my first rodeo, I've installed similar fans before, so nothing was that hard to figure out.  (the little nut-driver with phillips head for tightening the screws was actually a pretty cool piece of engineering).<br />If you get stumped by the poor instructions, there are good videos on the web that will make it clear.  Very nice price point for great cooling, hard to find anything to gripe about, really.
B001EC3JME|4.0|This holster works well for the flashlight I have. Some reviews said it was tight, and it was. My light is pretty small, about 5&#34;, so it fit it well, but it can be stretched out a little. Better to be too tight then too loose. It also swivels so you can point the light.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|It was worth the $5 rental.  We found that both kids and adults liked the movie but I would not buy it. Just rent it.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|This is a necessary addition for anyone who downloads documents of any kind from the web. Thee are a lot of adobe instructions and manuals that you will need a reader for. I like it.
B00E5Q1HJS|4.0|Granted originals are always the best, I was really pleased with this sequel. Only problem is that on streaming, sometimes it looses the HD and that kills it!
B000JMKOI2|5.0|This is probably the best book by Bukowski. It covers it all and I was really sad when it was over. It's like having a dinner guest charm the pants off of you, then they leave. His words are heartfelt, each word seems to have a life of its own, like its been fermented in guilt, sorrow, ecstasy, intoxication and lust, then etched onto the page with a dull knife.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love having this app with friends an familyI love it I play on my free time and my kids do to love it  : )
B000SEHJGQ|5.0|I tried writing like this book, but that's like trying to keep up with a Lamborghini in a Volkswagen, no offense, I love VW's. A lot of writing these days is bland and watered down, or it's intellectually profound and politically correct, which makes me gag by the pretentiousness of it all. Ham On Rye is a sweet lullaby into the terror of a father who beat his son nightly. I wanted to kill the father myself, but now they're both dead. Bravo Chinaski!!!!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This is an extra special book provoking enormous feelings. I was so moved, I found myself stopping to pray and give thanks to God and the universe for my long list of blessings. How my life and childhood was the exact opposite of Victoria's. I hurt so deeply for her I often cried while reading. So happy about the ending. A must read..
B0077ATSSQ|5.0|Thomas Horn convincingly portrayed the psychological effects of the trauma of the 9/11 tragedy on a child whose father died in the North Tower. That a person as young as Thomas Horn could master such a demanding role is most impressive. The story itself was touching and inspiring, demonstrating the indomitable human spirit.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This is one of the better escape games. Most of the time I beat these games pretty easily but this one was a little harder.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I just wish the author knew how to use a thesaurus.  Wish she didn't repeat actions ie biting lip, everything Ana does &#34;shyly&#34;. I find myself skimming over or replacing words/actions.
B0001I561E|5.0|I bought this for my granddaughter and her daddy. Her daddy saw that we owned it and watched it when they visited. So I ordered it for them. It came in brand new condition, and she loves the movie. Her mommy said she would watch it everyday if she let her. So very happy about this purchase and happy with seller. Thank you.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is really neat, it has seek and find and puzzle solving. You don't have to buy things if you don't want to, you just have to wait for things to recharge over time. Great graphics also.
1475143389|5.0|I thought it was a good book. Very informing to those who believe the fake hyper<br />and ive been working out trying to shah healthy and find the best work outs to get the best gains so I am always reading although youcant believe everything you read but I will take you upnon your studies as I ttynto reach my peak.

B005F9TQ0Q|5.0|Great CD ...the price was good...better than looking all around the music dept. in stores ..was delivered in timely manner..no family was pulling at me to finish shopping...all the music is great on this CD...packaging was intact..package in Great condition on arrival
157421327X|4.0|Zentangles Basics combines art and meditation. Following patterns in the workbook or branching out on one's own provides artistic development.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I think this is on of my favourite games. I love this game, wish there were more levels to it.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is the best. It is better than subway surfers. Minion rush is going to continue and get better every year. Run minions!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|The kindle is a bit awkward to use facebook, but I believe that is due to my preference to use a computer for facebook. As I use it more, I am sure I will like it....it will take some time.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Game play is super with the ability to upgrade. The speed is challenging after a while. It keeps you on your toes.
B008XG1X18|1.0|The pinterest app on my kindle is so awful, it is constantly closing and and shorting out. It does not have all the features that the main site has, for the things that you might want to do; like rearrange your boards, or see the 'recommended for you' tab, or change the cover of your board, or see people you may want to follow. But, my biggest pet peeve about the app is that you cannot zoom in to read the small print, and when you click on the pin to read it more closely it stupidly puts a link at the bottom of the pin causing you to not be able to finish reading a meme, or the last step to a recipe. So irritating, please update soon):
B008X9Z3UC|5.0|I really like how the Belkin Portfolio Sleeve provides a perfect travel solution for the [[ASIN:B008SYWFNA Kindle Fire HD 7\\"]]. The Belkin has a stylish high-tech look with two zippers that hold the Kindle securely in place. The padding inside the Sleeve helps protect my Kindle from the elements. The Belkin is flexible, allowing ample room to stuff papers like notes and receipts.<br /><br />I value the Belkin Portfolio Sleeve for making my travels with the Kindle more safe and convenient.  If you are like me and enjoy using your Kindle to access content on-the-go, then I highly recommend this very useful product to you.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|The product is in good condition and I loved watching all three seasons. I even started drinking hot tea in a cup and saucer instead of a mug.
0547258305|1.0|I can't express how much I hated this book. There's being an empowered female, and then there's being obnoxious, in your face, I don't need anyone because I'm STRONG and TOUGH female<br /><br />I can't recall a protagonist I hated more. Katsa is a nasty, unlikable, awful character. She's cruel to everyone (the author tries to occasionally show her doing some kind of forced kindness, which I never bought) and appreciates no one. She treats everyone horribly. I find it hard to believe the males falling at her feet find any redeeming qualities about her. The author seems to think marriage is some kind of evil institution that holds woman down. Hey Kristen, how about Katsa and Poe being married, and being EQUAL?! No? Instead let's have Katsa renounce marriage as some kind of way to hold a woman down. If she really loved Po, she wouldn't have acted the way she did. She would have wanted to be an equal partner with him, and they could have accomplished things together. Instead she just uses him for sex. What a great message.<br /><br />Obviously I'm in the minority, but this book just wasn't for me. It's to bad because I really wanted to love it. One of the few times I wanted to return for a refund, instead I tossed it in the trash.
B00EHAIHWM|3.0|Not a bad sounding album. Just enough jump to keep the kiddies dancing without being techno. Sounds awfully familiar though, kinda like Oingo Boingo from the 80's. I guess everything old is new again.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I like this side scroller, it's a relaxing way to be entertained for a bit. My favorite feature is the &#34;Missions&#34; , they give me something to shoot for instead of just mindlessly gathering coins and trying not die.<br />You can finish the game and start again, there are MANY achievements to reach.<br />Dying doesn't cost you anything, so the frustration factor is very low.<br />Coins can be used to purchase Gadgets, clothes, equipment upgrades, etc for &#34;Barry&#34; and there is an amusing assortment.<br />I highly recommend this for the casual adult gamer as well as for children.
B00BEIYMIS|1.0|I love to be scared. The Warrens are the real deal and their many stories are terrifying.<br /><br />How this movie can be so bad with such good subject matter is remarkable. Maybe it will win a Razzie.<br /><br />Don't waste your money. I still want my $5 back!
B006OZKX02|1.0|Just as all the other reviews stated, the X-Men First Class is a region B blu ray and there is no advertsing about that fact on the description.  This is very bad adverstising and I'm surprised that Amazon is still selling it after these reviews.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I got this case after having an Otterbox for a while. The sleek design really appealed to me a lot more than the chunky design of the Otterbox. It is also just as durable. It really does stand up to its waterproof and dirt proof and near everything proof marketing campaign. As an example of this, I have had this with me in multiple situations including water (including submerging it), and dirt and my phone has continued to function at its optimum. The color options were also great. I really appreciated having such a large variety of colors to choose from. I would definitely recommend this product for anyone who wants to keep their phone safe.
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|Have not yet finished it but loving every line.  Cleverly woven characters and  intricate stories.  He is one great writer!
B00BSZZA3I|1.0|The case doesn't stay closed. If it goes flying through the air (which may happen, and the reason why I wanted it protected) the front of phone won't be protected because the flap freely and easily opens on it's own. The case makes it awkward to hold the phone too.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I have been completely obsessed with \\"The Walking Dead\\" since watching Season 1. Each episode wants you wanting the next! I watched week to week on cable, and am now thrilled to be able to rewatch all at once! (**NOT a show for the squeamish!**) ADDICTED to The Walking Dead!!
B002BRRTUO|5.0|It is a cult/campy classic movie.  Just a fun movie.  Music by Queen - Flash 'a - ha' he saved everyone of us.
B008MU8ZNO|5.0|I am very annoyed with any friend of mine that has seen this movie and not told me.  This was a great movie to watch.  Scary, funny, sappy.  Some of it is very clever.  Watch at night with a door open for greater affect.  And try to tell yourself you won't flinch next time you see a clown!
B0095VP8D4|5.0|The one thing I love about AMD is their obvious love for budget builds. Thanks to how fast this processor is and the fact that it comes with integrated graphics I saved $150 by not buying a graphics card. The integrated graphics are enough to run Skyrim on moderately high settings with a decent frame rate and Crysis 2 on default settings at 1360x768 resolution. If you have the money, buy a higher caliber APU so you won't need to upgrade in the future, but if you're on a budget this CPU is a great way to go.
1477467041|2.0|a lot of grammatical errors, seemed like a sketch copy or something. I would look for a different printing of the book.
1577314808|4.0|Eckhart Tolle's Power of Now is helping me find Spiritual life in a world of confusion. I would recommend this journey of living in the Now to those looking for enlightenment.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a fun game. it is addictive to play!!!! You have to pay close attention to the rockets!! You might lose if you do that.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much. Easy to read and easy to follow the story line and characters. The book needs to be proofread.
B0031RS44S|4.0|another great read it was interesting to meet some of his friends in this book. You see them in your mind and can picture them and what they meant to him a great friend to have and you know what ever the problem and hurdles there are in the story his logic and nerve will see it through.
0061122416|4.0|I really like this book, It was a very quick read with a very strong point. I enjoyed how the boy progressed though out the story and enjoyed the end very much, but during the story I could not help but wonder if the boy was wearing shoes.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This was the best and most believable of any of the books I've read regarding an Near Death Experience. I appreciate Dr. Alexander's scientific approach and description of what his ailment was. He provides plausible evidence that there is something grand beyond this life as we've suspected all along.
B005PK56TA|3.0|I watched this dispute the sexual over kill.  There were some great stories here but.... But too raunchy for me.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Reza Aslan wants to spread the good news about Christ. Although Aslan says he is a Muslim, in his book, &#34;Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth,&#34; he never mentions the Islamic perspective of Jesus. If Aslan had used the Qur'an as his primary source, his work would have been grounded in truth and would have had a link to the religion of Abraham and to God's eternal message.<br /><br />Putting Jesus on the cross when the Qur'an says he was never there is not only an odd thing for a Muslim to do, but it also deviates from God's eternal message of submission. Nowhere in the Old Testament is there a prelude to Aslan's supposed message of blamelessness, crucifixion, resurrection, and saviorship. Paul merely presented this and found an audience willing to accept it, without proof. Jesus showed men the way to self purification and submission to God; there is nothing in what is left of the Gospel to indicate otherwise.<br /><br />The Qur'an tells us that the message God revealed through Christ--the Gospel--was intended only for the Children of Israel. That message was replaced with a universal message--one for all of mankind--and was revealed through Muhammad in the Qur'an. God promised to protect the Qur'an from corruption. (Today the Qur'an remains the same as when when it was revealed to Muhammad 1400 years ago.)  If God had chosen, He could also have protected the message given to Christ. In everything that God does there is a plan.<br /><br />While Aslan's work meets the burden of the scholar--he informs, he enlightens, he inspires--his effort to weave together a message from what remains of Torah, and Gospel, and the cryptic writings of historians fails to give the faithful a message they can rest assured is indeed from God.
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|I didn't think I was going to like this show.  I'm not a huge TV watcher and one of the few shows I watch is Burn Notice.  Disappointed it will not be returning to USA but because of that, I decided to give Suits a shot just this summer and I have to say that I am hooked.
B00D5YNQWM|4.0|I would of like if &#34;Dream On&#34; was on the DVD because it is my all time favorite song but anything that Aerosmith presents is gold to me.
B008OOYALE|1.0|So I decided to play the game and after a while it got boring and I found out that the game was no longer fun and addictive,and also found out that out it was sucking every $$ you have in 20 minutes! Come on,now!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|FREAKING AWESOME! this game is very cool! I play it all the time. I recommend it to everyone.  IF YOU LOVE THE MINIONS THEN PLAY IT. you wont be disappointed.
B003E48AYC|4.0|Enjoyed this take on a classic.  Depp's performance was outstanding along with the colorful imagination of the world.  Very much recommend this movie for those with an imagination.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Everyone, at one time or another, wants to go back in time and change some part of history....weather it be there own or a public disaster.now I know why it is not allowed!
0345529057|5.0|BEST deal ever! Having never had read the books, I decided to order the box set at this fantastic price!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is the only one I tried, but I see no reason to look elsewhere.  I love that it is so large and have absolutely no complaints.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Good Stuff! So good that I wish I could play more. It's pretty darn close to the real deal! Yep
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|This is my first time reading Neli Gaiman and I can't say how much I was impressed, moved, excited, charmed, frightened. I love to read but this time I can't get this story out of my head. If it wasn't a dream before it is now. Highly recommend
B003U6BE8I|3.0|Movie was well done but the story line could be better.  According to my daughter it was pretty true to the book.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game that reqquires you to use some brain cells- can't complain about the cost either! Here's. hoping there are new levels added soon.
B004GYY714|5.0|What a fabulous product. Occasional loss of signal. We both love it. It's on all day. Get it.. price is right
B008JFUTT0|5.0|This movie was really fantastic!!  Great music and a true story made it a movie to enjoy again and again.  My husband and I both loved it!!  5 stars!!
B00BXI26XC|5.0|Fantastic details. Don't need to check on airlines web sites, you can watch planes in flight and get exact times of arrivals.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|My husband and I really liked this movie.  It starts out a little questionable but by the end, we knew we would watch it again and again.  The language is in French with English sub-titles.  That did not interfere with the enjoyment of the movie.  5 stars!!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Really fun game but it almost impossible to buy the other costumes plus there should be more paths, it gets boring running the same 3 paths over and over
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Excellent. No complaint. Durable. Hard cover fits exactly onto kindle fire. Inexpensive. Love it. Would buy it again. Retail at store was $40.
B005CKPQ7A|5.0|what can I say, awesome series and well worth the time to watch.  Great character development and a wonderful story line.
B000002O4X|4.0|I play this music in my car. Very relaxing, just like watching the movie over again. Good for long  travel.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|Great book.  Couldn't get to end fast enough.  Wasn't expecting the twist.  Just a little disappointed in the ending, just looking for a happier ending
B009AY04A8|3.0|A simple game but fun way to kill some time I like being able to skip the dialogue . Condensing the game was free I'm very happy
B004CURZFC|5.0|I enjoyed this family DVD as it related to the owls.<br />My mother was a huge collector oh owls as this brought<br />back many memories of her.  I know she would have<br />loved this DVD.  A well told story from the beginning to<br />the end.  Congratulations to all.  Dave Berry
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is really addictive, especially when you start the race against time. I think I did not feel like this since the Tetris fever...<br />If you are just a bit competitive, then this game is for you. If you want to start thinking a bit different, then this game is definitely for you.<br />Some levels seem to be impossible, but once you figure it out you cannot believe you did not see it from the first time. Remember, the shortest path is not always the correct one.
1609611543|5.0|It appears I do...I've now read the entire thing and will be getting on the program soon...am attempting to get several friends on it too!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|too much fun not to play! passes the time no matter where you are... I now have the entire family playing and they live it too!!!
B005PK553C|5.0|This is a show that I couldn't stop thinking about!  Always looked forward to seeing the next episode!!!  I can't wait to see season 2!!!
0307474259|5.0|Taubes's book is an easy read - you can almost skip to the last couple of chapters & look at the summaries of what to eat, but if you want to really know why, his explanations make sense to me (and believe me, I have read a boat-load of them).
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Love it I recommend it to anyone. Pic it up you won't regret it or be able to stop playing the game.<br />Awesome
B00B9366VO|5.0|I loved watching this piece. The history of this studio is incredible and Dave Grohl handled the subject matter beautifully.  It was a great walk through musical history as well and I loved the new collaborations at the end of the film.  It was a testament to music being a collaborative process, well, good music anyway, and fantastic to witness with such stellar artists!
B0095GXUDY|5.0|Have passed this on to two others.  Really a wonderful read, and I hope he writes more like this one.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Having read The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns previous to this, I had very high expectations for this book.  While it wasn't quite up to the bar those set for me, it was still an aching tribute to choices made and promises kept and broken.  The intertwining of the stories worked beautifully and the writing was excellent.  Hosseini continues to be one of my favorite contemporary writers.
B0000252YK|4.0|I can't believe that this 1986 Ozzy album is no longer recognized. I think the reasons are political and thus monetary, which is a shame, because this is a good album. Yes, it does sound a bit commercial, but it's still heavy metal. Well, maybe on the glam metal side. However, there's still much to like here. The title track is decent, and SHOT IN THE DARK is a grooving number. The best track on the album is, without a doubt, KILLER OF GIANTS. This song has a very cool guitar opening that's on the dark side. This song is Ozzy all the way. Overall, not a bad album, and still sounds fresh all these years later. 7.5/10
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|Its one of those that I've loved the movie and watched it many a time but never read the book.  Loved it even better than the Movie
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have purchased dozens of electronic books along side of my hard backs and I am thrilled to be able to add these books to my bookshelf with un cracked bindings and still read them in the electronic format.
1451648537|5.0|I am a PC guy, but idol this man for his life story. Steve Jobs is undeniably very interesting and one of a kind. No doubt, Walter Isaacson kills it. Anyone will enjoy this read without the slightest interest in tech or computers.
B004ZN9YNC|4.0|From 1979 onwards, Roger Waters completely dominated songwriting and production for Pink Floyd. Gone were long, contemplative pieces like Shine On You Crazy Diamond and Animals. Waters brought shorter, highly-personal songs. While the rest of the Floyd may have complained at first, the huge success of The Wall trumped all objections. Richard Wright was the only member who saw The Final Cut for what it was: a Roger Waters solo album. Wright does not even play on this album.<br /><br />But, even as a Waters solo album, there are some great songs. With its orchestral arrangements and song themes, The Final Cut sounds a lot like The Wall and David Gilmour adds some outstanding solos.<br /><br />It's too bad Waters couldn't let go of the reigns and allow his bandmates to contribute more. They may have continued.<br /><br />[DW]
B005PK56TA|3.0|This show was much better than average, but not good enough to rate one star away from the best of the best.
B00DH1G7DS|5.0|This is very enjoyable. The timer gives you a goal to shoot for - to see if you can beat your best time. The puzzles are challenging without being frustrating. Would recommend this product to anyone who enjoys sudoku.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|I have seen this in the theatres three times, now I own it and I have watched it once and I plan to watch it every week for the rest of my life.  The story delights me.  I know some of these people, they are so real to me.  My daughter worked in theatre also and I can't wait to watch it with her.  I can't believe that Dustin Hoffman had this in him, well bless him for telling the story of these artists who are able to enjoy life together to the end.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I found this app to be very entertaining. It was challenging yet not impossible. The puzzles were logical and fun. Looking forward to more rooms being added.
159463176X|5.0|I've read all of Hosseini's novels now and I've been captivated by them all.  He had me in the palm of his hand from the very beginning on this one.  He's telling me the truth about the human condition and he makes me wake up.  It's an important story.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|My 11 and 13 year old girls really enjoy this game when they have a few minutes to kill.  I have rated it based on their use of the app.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i think my horse is awsome.  and fun to play as a normall game on your kindle.  in my opinion it is one of the best games
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|What would the cloud be without .pdf and app is the only way to read them is with Acrobat.  Recommend
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Great game. I Really enjoy playing this game. Great fun and gets the brain working.mixturd of puzzles and hidden objects
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I used to use TWC's app several times a day, every day. When this upgrade came out, it was a disaster. I have stopped using the app as it is confusing, difficult to navigate, it has lost features, and they added some ridiculous points and achievements thing where they want to sucker you in to doing tasks. DELETED. Please bring back the old version!!! There was nothing wrong with it!!
B002G1YPH0|5.0|A lot Better than any stock cooler, cheap and works will. I would recommend it to anybody building a new computer.
B00BSBUZPK|4.0|I really enjoyed this DVD and would highly recommend it to all fans of the Eagles. It would have been even better if the 1977 Hotel California disc contained more of that concert.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I could not stop playing this game.  The problem with it is there are only 10 levels.  Tho it is a lot of fun.
B000000OMB|5.0|I HAVEN'T HEARD THIS CD 4 A LONG TIME. SO ITS SOO NICE 2 NOW OWN IT! IT GREAT MUSIC!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|What can I say...it's Facebook.  I have found tons of old high school friends that I never thought I'd ever see again. You do have to be careful, it is a social network. Don't give out personal information.
B001NAT05W|5.0|GOT 2 SEE IT ! HALLE BERRY IS A SEXY LADY ! SHE IS A GREAT SUPER HERO OF CAT WOMAN.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I got this game for my daughter. She loves it and is pretty good at it. She got me playing it and it is hard to put down.
B000ICXQHE|5.0|THIS MOVIE/ACTORS DO A GREAT JOB OF KEEPING U ON THE EDGE OF YUR SEAT MOST OF THE TIME. GOT 2 SEE!
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|This series is like a cross between Star Trek and a thriller/suspense movie.  The CG is not very good, but that is to be expected from a TV show.
0780622650|5.0|I NEVER SAW THE ONE BAC IN THE 60S . BUT I REALLY LIKE THIS ONE ! TE F/X IS GREAT! GOT 2 SEE!
B00E193TM2|5.0|Another great album by a great band I loved every track. Its great to listen to in the gym. Haven't had a pump just from listening to a song in a long time.
0767817478|5.0|GREAT MOVIE! KIND OF SAD BUT VERY INTERESTING . THERE'S LOTS OF ACTION! DRAMA! GODZILLA LOOKS GOOD THE F/X DID GOOD!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|So much fun to watch was my second time viewing.  Recommend to anyone who likes action and super hero movies.
B0002V7OI8|5.0|THE ACTORS DID A GREAT JOB IN THIS MOVIE! THIS MOVIE WILL BRINING TEARS 2 YUR EYES AN KEEP U INTERESTED!
1401938906|5.0|I am so excited about this book! I live in Mexico and it was a little bit hard to get it, but i have it now and is fantastic. I also bought one for my friend. It's really easy to prove each experiment. Definately it was worth it!!
B00863CMZE|4.0|great cd but thought a live show might have been longer,but if you like blackmore's night then this is a must have.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Awesome book will keep u reading for hours it's hard to put down. Would recommend it to anyone she is an amazing author
B00785P2QC|5.0|So far so good. Just started playing, but I like that the goals are easy enough for my kids to play.
B00CMYRVAO|5.0|I have all of Joe's music he is fantastic with almost every song being on the CD being a keeper.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Reminds me of rooms and doors. Starts out simply enough and then gets a little trickier. My teens love it and keep stealing my Kindle and spoiling the puzzles.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|tv must have hdmi input and a usb input, logs on thru google chrome and works beautifully. right now hard to buy.
B008K8U13K|5.0|My son enjoys this game alot! He would rather play these games than the XBox games and to me that says a whole lot!
B00DPY95D6|1.0|This book was like watching a train wreck in slow motion.  Thank God it was free because I would not have wanted to pay for this.  The writer wrote long boring pages and the writing was immature and repetitive.  I'm not certain who this book would appeal to. .
0399159347|5.0|I read this novel in recordtime. It was so fast paced,  and the characters jumped off the page seeming so real. I can't say much about the plot so no spoilers.  The story offers much to think on about telling the truth and living with lies. This was like a great soap opera you wanted it  to keep going and going and not end. It was that good.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|Its hard to find things need a thing to find word cause really find da words in here so ya
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|Behind the reincarnations and the compelling personal stories, there is a deeper moral perspective well worth pondering.  For every deed there is a consequence.
140006922X|4.0|with an historical timeline, and very well researched, the &#34;true&#34; picture of Jesus really appears.<br /><br />when viewed with the existing cultural conditions, the Biblical narratives take on a more personal note.<br /><br />it reaffimed my Faith!
B009JBZH54|5.0|I am a Batman movies fan and this special Bluray set is just great.<br />The booklet has great photos and info.<br />I fully recommend it.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Really enjoyed this book by Kate Morton.  Once i started i couldn't put it down and i am continuing to buy more of her books.
B005EWDA9M|5.0|I haven't read many books that are narratively depicted to be as vivid and as engrossing as this is. I found this to be an engaging read, the characters are set into their roles, back stories have played out, now its the beginning of the end.
B001QOGYBI|4.0|I really enjoy the animation style of this movie, and the story.  The cast is superb and the movie is great.
030758836X|4.0|Not having started reading GONE GIRL until more than a year after its original publication, I have little to add to what's already been said about the book, other than I enjoyed the hell out of this intricately plotted roller-coaster ride. Amy and Nick are fully developed main characters (unlikable though they may be), and the story kept me reading much later into the night than I ought. Sure, perhaps the ending was a little \\"wait, whaaaat?\\" but upon reflection I think it was fitting. Let's just say that everyone got pretty much what they deserved.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I like movies with a good story, snappy comeback lines and stuff that blows up. This one has it all!
1582701709|5.0|I had this book in another language and never was very interested in its contents. As soon as I had this new edition I couldn't put it down. Will recommend it to any avid reader. A must have and must read in every home.
B004GJYRA0|4.0|It's a Pleasant movie. I recommend it to everyone who wants wholesomewit a twist of unusual. And that is all.
B000FCK65W|5.0|This was a beautiful story about life. Even though it was written over fifty years ago we still have the same problems today. This book should be required reading for high school. This was an amazing book
B008HK3XOU|5.0|Mother In-law loves the case.  She specifically wanted red so this was a great find.  Reasonably priced and works wonderfully
B00DIJ49UW|5.0|Excellent soundtrack for an excellent movie. The movie was surprisingly good and one of the strong points was how the film and sound worked so well together to communicate the mood and tempo.
B0084U0IEG|5.0|Better than the usual beach reading, and lots of fun.  Great period detail and interesting quirks...Ian McEwan can make an intriguing story from seemingly random threads...
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|It was really worth watching, I enjoyed it a whole lot, and it was a movie  the children could watch, not many movies, very few movies that the children can watch nowadays. I would recommend this movie for the whole family.
B00D3LA5WG|5.0|Love Matthew McConaughey he is quite the actor! He is able to be THE CHARACTER, to become that person without any difficulty at all.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This DVD is great to show us how we were wasting our planet, we need to plant more trees, and take care of our water supply,<br />or our kids and grandkids, won't have a earth to live in.
B0090EHVMC|4.0|I was kind of scared the Lorax would be too annoying, but it wasn't. The movie was cute and had a good message. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who has kids or likes a fun animated movie.
B001KMB6VE|4.0|Got it on time, and new, this was a good movie, into the future, it will worth watching. I like the actors, and Blu-ray was good.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I love Game of Thrones, both the books and the series. My only complaint is that after season 1, the show doesn't follow the books as accurately. Still, it keeps me on the edge of my seat, and I love the characters. Great series!
B002VPE1AW|5.0|This was a really good movie a lot of action, and had a storyline, thought greed and ruthlessness of destroying somebody else's land. That had a lot of good animation, and it won't be long will have them kind of robots. And the children can watch it to.
B00E66QPCG|5.0|It's every traders dream to automate a trading strategy and let the computer do the work. But it doesn't work like that. Trading is an art, not a science. I've tried to automate trading strategies for years, just to realize that a discretionary trader with a rule based system will outperform automated trading strategies any day.<br /><br />The reason is simple: As the authors explain in Chapter 12, there are situations in which you need to use your own judgement to skip a trade. As an example, you don't trade into a major economic release like GDP or unemployment reports, and it's usually best not to trade into major support and resistance levels. These are some basic rules that are easy to implement for a discretionary trader, but it takes a lot of effort to program this into automated trading systems.<br /><br />If you are looking for an automated trading system, this book is not for you. However, if you are looking for a strategy with defined rules that ANY trader can execute, you should get this eBook.<br /><br />I am impressed with the method that was shared, and you definitely can't go wrong for this low price.
B00005OAIE|5.0|great tunes, great lyrics, formula music or not, it rocks. one of the greatest cds of all time. no $#it
B009ME47H2|5.0|On my Kindle Fire HD 8.9, the built-in microphone is between the HDMI and the USB ports. If you speak close to it, it does a very good job recording. I'll check to see if the Pro version saves the recording as an MP3 file, then I'm all set. Even with the wav format right now, I'm happy. Thanks.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Rented movie for the wife and I to watch. Turned out to be kind of funny and story line was pretty good.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great app and very easy to use.  I haven't had any problems with the app. Great for basic math calculations!
B000OJFV4C|5.0|Could not wait to watch another episode. Very entertaining and the costumes were wonderful. Learned a lot about that period of time and the changes came about in the churches.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|If you love the show, you'll enjoy this game.  Artwork is true to the show and the voices are the true actors.  Relaxing mini games and building fun.
B0081JPTCQ|2.0|Might be great app but not instantly loving it and don't have time to learn it. An app should be easy to jump into this one is not.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|This was an entertaining, feel good read and was written with beautifully balanced humor and story telling. I actually couldn't put the book down and really want to read the sequel. I've already recommended it to everyone I've talked since I started reading it.
1452126607|5.0|I can't wait to use my 2014 grumpy cat calendar! Pictures, grumpy phrases and size are great. It should have more individual pictures of her each week or day (like a small pic). Anyway it's a great calendar...can't wait to use it!
B0007PAMR4|3.0|Dune is one of the lousiest movies, maybe thē lousiest.<br />So it's dandy to see the extended version when life seems purdy good.
B000JQUHLM|4.0|The story was light-hearted, fluffy, and had a good ending.  I was tired of reading tragedies, so this story was a delight.  The ending was predictable which was just okay.  This story would be good for just about anyone who craves a change from the dark side.
B004CLYKLI|4.0|I liked Amy's whit and expanded vocabulary I liked her honesty and letting us glimpses into her life. The ending was a great note.
B003V40SGS|3.0|Not as kid-friendly as I remember but a decent movie for sci-fi fans who have nothing better to watch.  Very 70s sci-fi...slow and story based.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Just like the classic version, but better. Upgrades are fun. Not the most challenging, but still a good way to burn some spare time.
1416549447|4.0|But, practicing and think it will benefit me greatly.  I think it is a book I'll continue to refer to.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|It was a good movie.  There was action and drama, I will now cetainly attempt to read the novels after seeing the movie.
B000069HJL|5.0|Have the LP which I bought when at University back in 82, nice to have it on disk. Getting on a bit now Supertramp but hey its the memories of the time and the place and of course the people.
B009FZHYKU|2.0|I can't play it with my adaptor on my TV---- I think amazon prime needs to fix whatever it is that is prohibiting us to watch it on out tv.
B000FC2KL0|5.0|What a life he lives. I laughed, cried, almost threw up (multiple times), and had so much fun reading this. Thanks for sharing, Swan - major respect to you.
0307959856|5.0|I read Pride and Prejudice decades ago.  I watched the film with my daughters.  I would not call myself a fan of Jane Austen.  The story was too slow and had too much romance.  So I was not sure I would like this story by James that is a continuation of the Austen story, using the same characters in the same time period, written in the same style.  Because of that, it took me a couple chapters to get into it, but my perserverence paid off.  I ended up loving the book.  If you have fond memories of Austen, get yourself into that mindset, make tea, and curl up with a blanket, your cat, or whatever, and enjoy.
B005ES0XVO|5.0|These crocs fit just like the blue-colored ones I tried on the crocs store. I got them cheaper here. It's a great buy, I would recommend them to anyone looking for a very sturdy supportive croc shoe!
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Fabulous CD and a great story behind the artist!  Not sure how the US missed him in the early 70's~
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Missile Defender has had a few minor adjustments from the original that I think nobody noticed. There are aliens in this one.
B005MHI0QM|5.0|What an amazing story. I read this initially while in high school and for whatever reason wanted to read it again. What an amazing story of those most difficult times during WWII. I'm glad I read this again, it makes me remember what the Jews have and are still going through.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I loved this book couldn't put it down. I highly recommend it. I can't wait to the next one. This my first book I read of cassandra Clare. She is an awesome author. Will be reading more of her books.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Takes a lot of thought to get the necessary tools etc. to open doors. Pretty challenging but not to difficult. Looking forward to more levels.
B003G4W49C|3.0|Good book but only a poor imitation of a similar story line in another book.  It was a little slow at times but worthy of a finish.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|This was a decent suspense movie, but I didn't understand why it couldn't be told more realistically. This movie needlessly ignored/diminished Canada's role, and it added some scenes for dramatic effect that weren't true- but the story was dramatic enough as it actually unfolded! I guess I'd rather put historical realism before making a few extra dollars....
B001KZG99A|5.0|Love the story, love the characters and the actors who fleshed them out and love the visual aspects of the film!
B000N2HCKQ|4.0|Easy to read, easy to apply and easy to recall.<br /><br />It is a great book that will allow you to craft messages and stories to ensure they will be remembered.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Have watched it twice so far and know I'll watch it again!  Hoping there will be another one very soon!
B001M0HGR2|5.0|Clearly 5 star.  You will not be disappointed.  It's a great plot with top shelf actors.  Watch before the rest of the series...
193700788X|3.0|Really predictable ending.  Felt Harris was just ready to finish and be done with it. I had invested years getting to know this world Sookie lived in, and would have expected more surprises. Felt the fans deserved and expected a more satisfying end. I sure did.
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|Wonderful intricate story and plot line, horrible delivery. What a waste of time... even for a girl, way too slow...
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|Susan's voice is clear and soulful with a touch of Bonnie Raitt. The band is extremely seasoned and loaded with talent. Loved the songs - very well done.
B000MD7OKY|5.0|Love it! Grant and Kelly shine with beautiful visuals and clever dialogue. A great choice for fans of classic films.
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|Really loved this one. Great writing, lyrics, and blues. Really enjoyed the guests he performed with. He is getting better with age, and never forgets the basics.  An essential for all serious blues lovers.
B005HI4LMS|4.0|My friend Justin told me I needed to watch this movie, but I've never heard of it and I was skeptical. The more he went on about this movie and the more we talked about it, it started to seem really funny. I ordered it and OMG!!!! It's hilarious!!!! Good acting, for being not well known actors. Very smartly written and it is now one of my favorites! Thanks Justin for opening my eyes!
0949551147|4.0|It was what I expected it to be and was in very good condition.  I will be referring to it for a long time.  Great!
B003Y5H5FG|5.0|Loved the 80's version of this movie and part 2 so when this came out I had to get it and I'm glad I did. Las Vegas is my favorite city I spend every birthday week there yearly  so Vamps and Vegas in a hit movie....YAY!!!!
0316228583|2.0|I was eager to read a JK Rowling novel that wasn't about Harry Potter, and what a great disappointment it was.  I was bored from the beginning and then saddened to find her handling of interactions between the haves and the have nots predominantly with gossip.  I am sorry I purchased the book and was happy to give it to the library book sale rather than to a friend or family member.  Lots of authors burn out after their first book or best series.  I felt Rowling burned out before she got to this one.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I love this movie me and my daughter watch it together continuously and sing along with the scripts. Makes us seriously want to join an Ocupella Group.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|So in love with this game. Have a bit of trouble putting it down, the challenge level increases at a nice pace, n the sorts pretty cute.
B008Y73940|4.0|very good storyline, plenty of action, a solid amount of comedy, takes place in downtown LA, all about street smarts
0761174192|5.0|I purchase this yearly for my daughter-in-law who is a cat lover.  She uses it at preschool and all the kids enjoy seeing a new cat every day!  Very nice quality.  I buy the dog version for myself and my daughters every year as well!
B007THA4FI|1.0|Unfortunately this book didn't meet my expectations. I started reading it and have put it down multiply times. It's a difficult read because there is nothing captivating or wanting you to read more happening in this book. Waste of time and money
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|this game is cool and  the maker is very talented but why do u have to use  facebook ,not cool
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|Well written and produced. Just when you think all is lost the Doctor comes through. Great acting and characters. Can't wait to watch the next one.
1423141997|5.0|My daughter loves this book..she said it is very similar to the other series, but still loves it,,she has read all of his books...
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|This movie was enjoyable, upping the stakes to being the whole world may have been to much. To many last minute plot twists that weren't fun or enjoyable.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is perfect!!! Its easy to play for kids and fun for all family members! Also is a very exciting game that u want To play again and again
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|This movie was significantly better than I was anticipating. The zombies are the best part especially with their internal dialogue.
B0026Q8EWW|5.0|Excellent characters. A great story superbly told. The arsenal of stars underplay their roles to normalcy. You absolutely believe this &#34;David and Goliath&#34; tale.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|i use it every other day<br />see the connections updates, etc.<br />send messages<br />accept and send invitations<br />all good and easy. :)
B0017SWPXY|5.0|People have been recommending this book to me for a few years, and I'm finally reading it.  Wow...  It is such a touching story, and well worth every tear.
1452126607|5.0|the posters got to me fast and were undamaged. good product.i would recommend for other fans out there .awesome.<br />ok.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|One of the last books to be published in the US, this is the first of the Harry Hole (Hoo-leh) series and is a must-read for Nesbo fans and hard-boiled crime thriller fans alike.  Maybe 4 stars is a fairer rating based solely on content, plot, development, etc., but having read nearly all the other in the series, this is a must for Nesbo fans and gives great insight into the main character, so on that merit alone I rate it 5 stars.<br /><br />Harry Hole is one of the all-time best developed, flawed-yet-likable crime-fighting characters.  Being a big fan of Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch in particular, Harry Hole is right up there.  A detective in Oslo, this book stands alone in that it is set in Australia rather than Norway.  I thought I'd be a bit disappointed in this but I actually enjoyed the location.  The character development of some of the other police officers in Australia were weakly developed, and there are other holes in the story line, but nonetheless it is a very good read.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0307595854 The Redeemer (A Harry Hole Novel)]] has also been recently released in the US (next on my reading list.)  [[ASIN:0307960498 Police: A Harry Hole Novel]], the latest book in the Harry Hole series is set to be released October 2013.<br /><br />Perhaps not quite as strong as subsequent works, The Bat is an impressive first work for Jo Nesbo, and I can't recommend the series strongly enough.  I'd recommend reading them as much in order as possible (although I didn't do this and didn't lose too much continuity.)  His later works in particular are not for the faint of heart, mind you. ([[ASIN:0307742997 The Snowman (Vintage Crime/Black Lizard)]] comes to mind...) Dig in if you can handle this genre; you won't regret it.
031603438X|5.0|i bought this book as a birthday gift for a rolling stone fan family member. The book was at a good price and was packaged very well.
B008602KQI|5.0|Keeps you entertained and thinking through. The books are even better but the movie does them justice! Watched it twice now.
B006GECE9Y|1.0|I could never get it to download to my Kindle Fire HD, so I can`t give it a rating. Too bad, because I`'ve read good reviews of it.
B003U4UPHG|5.0|Continuing to be fun and exciting, this show hasn't let me down. It has kept a pretty good pace thus far, and there haven't been to many &#34;wtf&#34; scenes, although every show has a few.

B000002J1O|5.0|absolutely love love love this cd.  great shape..no scratches etc....I lost this years ago and now I cant play it enough.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is entertaining for my daughter. She loves horses! All I hear out of her mouth is asking when we are going to buy a horse!
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|The classic game of uno, behind a pay to play wall. I would have liked<br /> it much better if it was a one time purchase and then unlimited play. If I wanted to wait to play I would stick to Facebook.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Its a great read with some very cleverly thought out ideas and scenarios.  The characters are well developed, and descriptions of the places and the various games easy to understand ... I normally get lost trying to imagine them.  Will definitely read the rest of the series, and can't wait to see the  movie!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game is calming and a good use of spare time. You do need patience or the game could be  a little frustrating
B00BMUVW5O|5.0|I couldn't put it down!  I just love Bob and James, and the honesty with which he recounts episodes in his life.  He's definitely on my &#34;would like to have dinner with' list!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Great app for my kindle fire! Let's me do what I need to for the most part. There are a few things that I have to get on a computer to do but no complaints here.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|From start to finish this book was great. So much more than just another zombie story. I loved that this book focused less on zombie slaughter and more on the psychological effects of the war and how the failure of humanity to believe in zombies caused our downfall.
B00007FOMP|5.0|I recently rediscovered this album and was blown away by Marvin's orchestrations.  Such an unparallelled body of music.... it should be listened to as a whole, but try \\"Inner City Blues\\" while wearing headphones and let it take you away.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Superlative episodic in every regard. Beyond highly recommended viewing (for the remaining  five people on the planet who haven't seen it yet).
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|A book for all ages. Captures you and doesn't let you put it down. Quite an amazing piece of literature.
0316228583|3.0|I got to the 32% mark in my Kindle before this book started flowing for me. The first third of the book just lumbered along introducing one unlikable character after another. The only thing that held my interest was the strong prose. Finally, a few of the younger characters came alive & I was rewarded by finishing one of the most depressing novels that I have ever read. If I did not love my EReader so much, I would have thrown it across the room after completing this very disturbing book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game I always play it when I am super bored I am so addicted to this game that I play it every day
B000028U0Y|5.0|I love Johnny Cash.  My husband loves Johnny Cash.  And last but certainly not least, my 13-year old daughter LOVES Johnny Cash.  This album is a must-have for any Johnny fan.  Almost makes me feel like I spent a day in Folsom Prison.  Almost.
B0091LS07E|5.0|Alicia can sing!!  I didn't like her last album but after hearing a few songs on the radio, I gave this a chance.  It was more soulful and meaningful to me than her last album. I like every song on it.  This woman is super talented and it can be heard in every last note she sings or plays.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Does this really need a review? It is a great book. It is very easy to read and you will be inspired!
B00DJZ06DO|5.0|It's a much different film from what you'd expect given the other two installments.  This is a much quieter film that the second one but the animation here easily is the best of the three.  In terms of the story, here certain flaws in the series are dealt with as well as building up something brand new.  While, overall, the films feel like a Cliff Notes version of a legendary tale, it's still a good introduction to a classic.
B002RI9PKO|3.0|Interesting perspective on what truly works for successful people. I felt Gladwell focuses overtly on the simplistic circumstantial opportunities afforded to successful people without giving due credit to their individual ability and persistence that enabled them to utilise those circumstances well.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Super fun and easy to keep up with the caller. Try it once or twice and you will be hooked.
0553386794|4.0|I read this book ages ago and then didn't go on to read the second book...not until the HBO series came out and I took a chance on it and got hooked.  Hence, me going back to re-read the original books.<br /><br />I still think what turned me off about them the first place is the main issue--this book (and all of the books) are just too long, have too many character pov changes, some of which add little to nothing to the plot, and too many minor characters who get dropped in or mentioned until you can't keep hardly any of it straight anymore.  That being said, the HBO series has helped me to get into the characters and the plot, partially by the work they had to do in trimming it.<br /><br />The good points, on the other hand, do outweigh the bad.  This is a fascinating world that the author has created, with just enough \\"touchstones\\" to our world scattered here and there, such as knights and dragons and hints of religions and clans that we can find in our own history.  This book hints more at magic than it actually contains, but I suspect that is coming.<br /><br />The Starks are a stern, honorable family and Ned Stark is called to take up the Hand of the King by his old friend, Robert, who took the Iron Throne when the old king was killed and his family destroyed.  The former Hand having died under mysterious circumstances.  There is, of course, plenty of intrigue and plots and backstabbing to be found in Kings Landing.<br /><br />Up North, Ned's son from the wrong side of the bed, has begun his journey with the Night's Watch, those who protect the 7 Kingdoms from what lies beyond the Wall, even though many no longer believe in the monsters said to live there.  While, across the sea, the remnants of the dispossessed \\"dragon\\" kings seek to reclaim their own lands by forging an alliance with the chief of the horselords, leading to the bond between the Khal and his silver-haired Khaleesi (my favorite character save for the Imp) who has been given 3 fabulous dragon eggs as a wedding gift.<br /><br />One can see where this is leading, but once you fall in love with the characters and the world you still want to see it played out.  As the Stark's say...winter is coming...<br /><br />Despite a rough start and despite wishing the books had been edited a bit more, I guess I am finally along for the ride.gs as a wedding gift.<br /><br />One can see where this is leading, but once you fall in love with the characters and the world you still want to see it played out.

B00E8TVHBA|5.0|My 7 year old daughter loves this movie and it is something we can watch together. Anytime I can escape the animated cartoons, I am all about it.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|Love this game, keeps my mind on the game and not my problems. Gives me the break I need. it relives my stress
B008JFUO4U|5.0|This was and is my favorite SciFi movie so far for 2013. I of course enjoyed Man of Steel, Star Trek, Iron Man 3, World War Z ,etc. But this one was a bit different and I thought it was well done and visually stunning. Wish I could see it on the big screen again. Oh and it has a killer score and interesting enough, the Blu Ray has an option to watch the movie with no dialogue and only the score playing. Pretty cool if you are a movie score lover. The other Blu Ray to have this was also a Tom Cruise move - Jack Reacher.
B00CATONCA|5.0|This Blu-Ray set is really awesome! The \\"Zombie Head Aquarium\\" is a hard plastic case with two plastic aquariums with either two or three (five total) severed heads with a few decorative twigs, both aquariums are removable and the lids come off, you can fill the two aquariums with water and put the lids back on. The case itself takes four (4) AAA batteries on the bottom, and right-side up, the front of the case, the \\"3\\" for \\"SEASON 3\\" is the button to turn on the six  little lights in the case that will illuminate the two aquariums, when put back into the case after filling them with water. The Blu-Ray DVD set fits into a sleeve in the back of the case. Batteries are separate. The Walker Heads are attached to a clip that clips onto the back of the aquariums, so that the heads gives the illusion that they are floating.<br />The Blu-Ray DVDs consist of five discs (Discs 1-4 are the Episodes. Disc 1 - Episodes 1-4.  Disc 2 - Episodes 5-8.  Disc 3 - Episodes 9-12.  Disc 4 - Episodes 13-16. Disc 5 - Bonus Features.) The Bonus Features includes: Episodes 4, 5, 8, 9, & 15 have Commentary; Behind-The-Features of The Walking Dead Season 3; and Deleted Scenes from Episodes 3, 5, 6, 10, 11, & 12. Inserts include the directions on how to set up the Zombie Head Aquarium, and the Special Offers insert for The Walking Dead and other AMC TV Series.
B00B769XB8|3.0|If you like these kinds of movie. It was what Terry Gilliam's Grimm Brothers could have been, although I liked that one for the Gilliam quirkiness. If you don't expect too much from H&G, you might find yourself having a good time.
B0002WZTOI|4.0|This was a good deal.  A young teen asked for this specific movie for Christmas on an Angel Tree.  It was hard to find in the stores so I was happy to order it on-line.  Very happy!
1439153663|5.0|It is hard for me to believe that this is Kathleen Grissom's first novel. I thoroughly enjoyed her style of writing. The determination of the characters touched my heart.
B000NGTJTY|5.0|In a day and age when stunts and special effects seem to carry movies, this movie stands out with superb acting and a very believable plot.  Although some of the acting is \\"over the top\\"  (no law enforcement agency could survive with such harassment or hazing of its employees) the majority is superb and very believable!  This is a fine movie if you are home alone or with a date who likes to watch a real movie and talk about it later.  Talkers DURING the movie will only serve to distract!  Get the popcorn and junk food ready because if you get up for it, or the restroom, you are going to miss something you'll regret missing.  I really enjoyed this movie.  The basic theme is law enforcement versus organized crime in Boston.
B00E66QPCG|1.0|Warning: you will likely lose money if you trade the strategy recommended in this book.<br /><br />The book describes a \\"simple strategy\\" based on a combination of basic indicators (RSI, Bollinger Bands, and MACD).  Although the book claims that the book has \\"clear entry rules,\\" some of the \\"rules\\" are actually rather squishy and ill-defined.  For example, the instructions are to set up a stop order when the close of a bar is \\"AT or NEAR the Upper Bollinger Band.\\"  How near is \\"near\\"?  This is a case of \\"I know it when I see it,\\" not a clearly-defined, unambiguous rule.<br /><br />From the text of the book, it is clear that the author has never properly backtested the strategy using automated techniques.  Instead, he recommends a manual form of so-called \\"backtesting\\" that involves simply looking at old charts for prior trading days and determining by hand (with the benefit of hindsight) where you would have made entries and exits.  This approach leaves a huge risk for subconsciously fudging the results -- you will tend to see trades where they would have been successful, while overlooking trades that would have turned out to be losing trades.<br /><br />I set out to test this strategy more rigorously, by coding the rules in the programming language EasyLanguage and testing it against historical data for the S&P 500 e-mini using the MultiCharts trading platform.  The results:  on average, you will lose about $33 per trade (including commissions and slippage).  I tried the strategy on some other symbols, as well, and it was similarly dismal.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|awesome and thanks. it was really great to have it come soon. i have enjoyed this season. i appreciate it

B00821OX98|3.0|it seems todays programming is just that to keep us afraid very afraid! All zombie monsters which since the Night of The Living Dead we all know that you must shoot them in the head. why do they waste so much ammo when they are short on supplies is beyond my imagination!  This sucked the big wind!!!
0316077046|5.0|great book, read the trilogy and don't watch the movie..doesnt do the books justice.  Great story, if you like a little romance, suspense, history and supernatural.
B0069JBKHI|1.0|We've owned this thing for over 6 months now, and I'm ready to declare that it is definitively terrible.  Withings tried so desperately to make this look like an Apple product, but it does anything but \\"just work\\".  The connection drops all the time, it is impossible to view the feed for more than 5 seconds.  The video quality is terrible and insanely choppy.  The 'alerts' are useless because the thresholds are inconsistent.  And what happens if you're out of town for a couple days and the thing decides not to recognize your wifi network any longer?  Get ready for non-stop alerts about \\"not able to monitor your baby any longer\\" until you can get home and unplug the thing.  This has happened twice and I literally had to un-install the app in order to get some peace and quiet.  Have tried factory-restoring it many times, no luck.  I was convinced for a while we had a lemon because I couldn't believe a product this bad would ever be declared ready for market, but Withings has never even responded to my request for a replacement so I guess I'll never know for sure.  You'd be better off using the $230 this thing costs to start a camp fire, at least you and your child would have something to smile about then.
0425263924|5.0|certainly not Fifty Shades of Gray but very similar. I would recommend it for those that liked Fifty Shades of Gray
B00CO9DY76|3.0|This is very small i totally underestimated the size.<br /><br />I have a couple tools key ringed on it and its not the best for holding multiple small tools.<br /><br />Bottle opener works, and the clip/lock is fine.<br /><br />overall its ok as and EDC tool key chain but i wish it was a bit larger.
1452110581|3.0|I bought this thinking the poetry would be a lot funnier than it was. Cute pictures of cats with poems \\"they\\" have written. I gave it to my friend's mom as a gift. In my opinion, the best poem in this is the title one. If you're looking for something more amusing that is cat related, there are probably better books than this one out there. What sells this one is clearly the title.  =^.^=
B00CMQX84A|3.0|Well, I didn't find much to like about this movie, but the three kids did - between 9-12. They've watched it 5 times in the last three days! Thanks, I think!
B00CXQL828|4.0|Too bad they couldn't finish this with John Sykes but Kotzen is very good as well. I was hoping for something a little more grittier but its just very good Rock music.
B00AN0KBJC|3.0|It's fun to watch only because I read all the books and like to see how their vision compares to what I conjured in my head. But great drama? Not really if you ask me.
B00DCRE7M0|5.0|nice recovery from the second album. The original with this band was an instant favorite of mine and the second didn't meet up to expectations. enter this 3rd edition, well done, heavy and awesome with some classic Labrie ballads tossed in. thanks guys.
B00DC3DGSK|3.0|Buddy has done a lot of other stuff I like better.  Glad I bought it anyway as wife and I are fans.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. The content is very scientific and fascinating, the delivery is as good as the best fiction writers. I wish all educational books were as fun to read as this one. I got emotional several times reading what's supposed to be scientific information! Great use of stories to communicate. Amazing style and delivery aside, the content of this book is life changing. Learning the habit loop is a very powerful tool to self analyze and use in organizational analysis. This book delivers practical advice that can be applied personally or in the business world. I'd recommend readers read the last 11 pages first, then go straight to page one. Don't skip the section prior to chapter one, every single page of this book has excellent content.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Great throw back game from the Atari days.  Needs to be able to add your name or initials though, so you'll be able to keep track of who has the high score.
0316232955|5.0|This book was just as amazing as the movie. Hope we get to see more of Chris Colfer's screenplays and books. I would recommand this to anyone which likes a good laugh and sarcastic reading.
B00DHHWYAW|5.0|Not only is it a wonderful film, it also portrays the story in a brilliant light.  It completely turns the story that is an iconic thrilling tale into a series of movie moments..<br /><br />Cast is wonderful, and I will even go as far as saying the more minor characters (Tom and Jordan) did an even better job than some others.  Mostly, the acting was amazing.  Daisy made you immediately interested, yet hate her more as the story went on which was perfect.  Gatsby was quite interesting and meaningful, but I feel as if he was too well-known to play the mystery part of the movie he should have been.  Too bad we all know how well he acts and exactly how he acts, so he didn't seem to portray the troubled and mysterious card very well, I felt.  But otherwise, he was brilliant.<br /><br />The story itself was shown perfectly, and the CGI scenes were quite easily portraying the 1920s dramatic city.  And you really felt like all of the cast believed that they were in this era, because of the new rise in the rich and the decline of the desperate poor.  Speaking of this era, the costumes deserve a complete A+.  It was amazing to see the sets with all of the early 1900s immigrant-like styles, after many Europeans coming over and settling over here in the US; and this means a colorful wardrobe, which was shown off to the greatest effect.  Altogether, do not even deny yourself to get this movie... If nothing else, it is a great history movie.  At its best, it is a wonderfully over-the-top heartful version of the classic book... The Great Gatsby 2013.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Awesome entertainment. Countless hours of fun. I started playing while in the restroom.....30 min later i was still in there just playing. Time flew while i was having some fun. Easy to uograde weapons and such. Wish there was a save and continue option
B00EFNXPFK|5.0|I love john mayer. when he came out with born and raised the first time i listened to it i was not a fan. then i slowly grew fond of it. the first time i heard this cd it seemed like the second half to born and raised but more mellow, like a cleaner cut then born and raised. i love this cd, but just like born and raised i think its too short, i want it to go on but it ends so fast. that's my only complaint. cannot wait to hear whats next for this guy!

B005LAIH3G|4.0|This is a good action flick , and most people who see it will like it. As it is a VERY HIGH BUDGET flick. NO expense was spared and this was done as a labor of love to the classic john carter of mars books by Edgar rice borroughs.  Those books changed popular science fiction and influenced all that came later. Of course edgar is better known for Tarzan. But this is a good version of his books.  It is very well done and In 3d it looks stunning. However , like most 3d you get depth here and little that pops out at you. Those who expect that don't know what 3d is really about , and may be unsatisfied on that account.  Not me though , as I enjoyed this film immensely. The effects are fantastic , the sets are great and stick to the books. IT's got a cool monster dog character , and has that romantic streak in it that we all love.  A man falls for a princess and fights for her!.  It's got good versus evil as well. It is amazing this got made at all. And I salute the people who did this , as they beat the odds to get this to the screen. The removing of mars from the title may have hurt this movie , I don't know. But this is a movie you can watch with your family and it's exciting , and afterward you can give your kid a john carter book to read! As they still thrill even today. Of course it doesn't help that we now know that mars is a wasteland. but back when this was written , people were sure that canals were on mars, and cities too. But it doesn't matter , as it's a cool movie.  A good action film that you can watch with your kids as even the violence is not too graphic. It's similar to the star wars type of violence. give this one a chance!.  The extras include deleted scenes, and other documentaries.  And even a blooper real. 3d is the way to go , but it looks fine in hd alone too.
B0049P1VHS|3.0|I wasn't overly impressed but my friend who I bought this for was over the moon.  It's more of a &#34;boy thing&#34; I think, so if you have brothers, friends, boyfriends, etc. they will probably like the zombie killing gore and epic action going on.  I tried to be involved in the &#34;soapy&#34; parts of the show, like Rick's marital issues, but by the end of episode one, I was just &#34;meh.&#34;  I will probably end up watching it with my friend, because he loves it to death, but it's not something I would seek out on my own.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is great<br />I play it every day it is so addictive<br /> Would recommend this game to everyone<br />it is a game that you will never get bored of

B001ANSSDC|4.0|This was a very good, couldn't tell how it was going to end, but it turned out great, would recommend for men and woman!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game! The nonstop action is awesome and the minions are funny....even in a game!! .
B009AMAJPA|5.0|I waited on this movie for months and was not disappointed. The acting was very good with a good plot to boot which is rare these days. Plenty of action closes the case for this being a good movie.
B008JFUN6E|5.0|Highly recommended for all to watch this who are into science fiction and action.<br /><br />Visuals were great, special effects were top notch, story was just fine, this had<br />a similar concept to District 9 (which had the same director doing this one as well)<br /><br />Don't ignore this masterpiece!
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Excellent sharpener for my chisel, ground and serated edged knives. Puts on a good working edge. Not so good for flat bladed knives as the 'V' angle between the grinders is at too wide an angle for a very thin edge. But hey, we all know flat knives need a stone and strop. This is a very good value, pocket-sized tool for ED use.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|First note, I rarely will write a review, I don't have the time or the movie stinks<br />MUDD is not that case. It is a fresh and wonderful movie!!!!!<br />The children in this story steal the show, the acting was phenomenal by all the cast members.  I didn't think it was possible to &#34;ugly up&#34; Mathew McConaughey , but they did.  It was a moving movie.  Worth seeing twice.
B00BP29SAA|5.0|My 3y/o and 6 y/o love to play Dr. Panda's Supermarket!  Very intuitive game that does not require reading, so perfect for my younger child.  Round up carts, clean up messes, help customers in the market.  This is my first Dr. Panda game...definitely not the last!
B004KPX4W2|4.0|This movie came highly recommended from a friend when I told her I was looking for a decent action movie.  To be honest, I was probably biased against seeing this film as I thought &#34;These guys are old, how well can they do action?&#34;  After seeing it, I can truthfully say, they do action quite well thank you.  In addition, they are all fine actors (ok, you have a point with Willis) that seem to be having fun and are into what they are doing.  If you want an action film with good action AND acting, I recommend this one.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Great hidden object games with SO MUCH MORE! This game has every bell&amp; whistle that any H.O. game Lover wants &amp; more! The only downside is that in order to truly enjoy all the game has to offer it costs money. But if you like H.O. games &amp; like time management games You will find this game has it all!
B00DW39B2K|5.0|Amazing ending!!! Beautiful country and plenty of action. If you are a veteran you will relate to this movie.  Rent this movie.

0785153942|2.0|I absolutely loved the movie Pacific Rim. I have bought the tie-in novel as well. In my review of that, I stated that the reason I wanted to buy those things was because I wanted more information on the heroine of the movie, Mako Mori, and Stacker Pentacost. Year Zero provided some of it, but I found the structure to be... odd.<br /><br />First of all, what the comic did right:<br /><br />It provided more background on the beginning of the Kaiju War.<br />It gave us more background on Stacker Pentacost, which was one of the reasons I bought it.<br />It showed how the Jaegers were invented, and how they created the neural bridge.<br />There are many more female characters with speaking roles.<br /><br />Year Zero was highly successful in that it hinted at the background the movie left out. My main concerns with it were how it was structured, and how characters were treated.<br /><br />(SPOILERS!)<br /><br />The structure of the story was pretty cliche: a pretty reporter is going around asking for background stories. Pacific Rim is derivative, but this was just lazy. Secondly, all of the POV characters were male. Not only is that annoying, it made the story more boring. There were many female actors, but we only saw them from the male POV and how they reacted to the men in their lives. Luna Pentacost got one conversation with her brother and two sentences with Tamsin. Tamsin pretty much shows up just to die. Doctor Caitlin Lightcap, the inventor of the neural bridge? We only see her as the wishy-washy love interest of two different guys. That's the only way she's portrayed, and we see nothing of her POV or the work she did to create the pons. It was frustrating because she was also turned into nothing more than fan service, even if she was the genius behind it all! It was highly implied that her romance with the guy who got the credit in the beginning is what gave her some terrible depression, and was medicated for it. But guess what? The love of a good man cleared itright up.<br /><br />For a story that has chosen to include far more female characters... none spoke to each other about anything than other men.<br /><br />This was a story that included a lot more female characters, but it felt like they were included to counter those 'annoying people' who were angry that there was only one female speaking role in the movie. But Mako Mori was the most interesting character in the movie, and Doctor Lightcap deserved better than to be treated as a boilerplate love interest that couldn't make up her mind in her story.<br /><br />And the less aid about the 'bros before hos' Beckett story, the better. That one disgusted me. Not only was boring, it was pathetic and cliched. A girl gets between two boys! WTF? It did nothing to try to give more depth or character to Yancy or Raleigh, who was meant to be the self-insert Bella of the tale.<br /><br />Overall, this story did was it set out to do. It was not worth the price, nor was it a particularly well told or interesting story. It came across very often as fanfiction-y and dull. Read it in the book store.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very well written! This book will have you holding your breath and its not about the sex (not to me) but the \\"word play\\". I couldn't put it down. Scolding myself for not buying the trilogy from the start. A MUST READ!
1936594234|1.0|This book was a big disappointment due to the poor editing. Don't buy it; not this version anyway. My first soft cover version had a white cover and it was awesome...one of my favorite books. I read it every day!
B008EEHRAU|5.0|I love this movie! Great acting, directing and character development. Alfred Molina really shows his acting chops in this flick!
B001UTW7QU|2.0|If you need white noise to help you fall asleep at night then I highly recommend Fringe Season 1.  The only character with a 3rd dimension is the affable Walter.  He is as charismatic as any mad scientist I have ever seen.  In fact, he is only reason I watch this show.<br /><br />I have been dragging myself through this first season because this show was loved by some of my friends.  They promise me it gets better, but so far all I can see is that I am surprised it ever got renewed.  Each episode is the same formula of weird incident, investigation, Peter complains, science experiment, Olivia scrunches her forehead and tries to look serious, resolution.  It is supremely boring to watch, save Walter's scenes.<br /><br />I think I should have watched a season one recap on youtube and saved 20 hours of my life.
B00CB3N5DS|5.0|This is worth your time and money. You won't be disappointed. If you love kung fu/martial arts - this movie is action packed.

B00632HWOG|5.0|Just installed this today on my Kindle Fire (not HD) and I couldn't be happier.  It is faster and easier to use than my computer and, so far,  I'm enjoying the notice that I have received mail.  This seems as if it will be a lot less hassle to keep up with my email so I will check them in a more timely fashion.  Hope it doesn't go downhill from here.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Good game.  In the beginning it froze up a lot and kicked me off in the middle of a game; it seems to be a bit better lately.  I have also lost money when purchasing more coins; for the same reason freezing up or kicking me out.<br /><br />There support is not the greatest.  I have contacted them (about losing money) it took a month for them to reply.  They wanted some info from me and I responded.  That was two weeks ago and I still have not heard back from them.<br /><br />I know you'd re wondering how can I have all these issues and still rate it a 4 and have negative comments?  Even with my issues I still like the game a lot.  It is my favorite out of several ( bingo) gsmes that I play.<br /><br />Keep working out the kinks

B008JFUN6E|3.0|For a film called Elysium, directed by Neill Blomkamp, there sure doesn't seem to be that many images or scenes of life there. Like 90 percent of the film takes place on a future ravaged, over-polluted, industrialized Earth focusing on Max Da Costa, played by Matt Damon or in a closed room on Elysium focusing on the elites of Elysian society including the secretary of defense Jessica Delacourt, played by Jodie Foster. I'll admit, it was a huge letdown for me. When I went to see this film last night and there were only a few scenes, mostly at the beginning and end, that focused on the beauty and luxury of Elysium. I went in to the theater thinking it would be the next visual masterpiece like Avatar or Life of Pi but instead it was much more like District 9, also directed by Blomkamp, and Children of Men in it's gritty atmosphere and violence. That's not to say I hated Elysium, because aside from the lack of scenes focusing on Elysium, it was a very impressive film. The action scenes and much of the futuristic technology are very cool, creative, and fun to watch. The themes of the film revolve around class, immigration, and healthcare, specifically in the USA in regards to Mexican and other Latin American immigrants. The story takes place in the year 2154 and revolves around Max trying to get to Elysium so that he won't die after getting hit with lethal doses of radiation during a tragic accident at work.<br /><br />The rich people living on Elysium, who are mostly white by the way, have very long life expectancies and no disease due to medical technology that quickly and painlessly cures any illness, and also has the ability to reconstruct damaged body parts. This technology is completely absent on Earth and because of this, and the high rate of disease and violence, many Earth citizens try desperately to get to Elysium, even if it's through illegal means, in order to cure themselves or escape the hell that Earth has become. It very similar to how many Mexicans try to cross the border illegally into America for a better chance at life and better healthcare. In fact, most of the Earth citizens are Hispanic in appearance and the film, rather than taking place on Elysium, mostly takes place in a future Los Angeles. In addition to Max, other important characters include Frey, played by Alice Braga a woman who was friends with Max as kids and has a daughter suffering from Leukemia, and Kruger, a vicious mercenary played by Sharlto Copley, who is the main villain of the film. He was excellent in his role, and as many others have noted, was one of the best characters in the film. The strongest point of this film, I believe, is the message that I took out of it, that any society where people are divided, whether it be class, color, caste, or even gender, is a failed society in the long run because it will only lead to anger, hatred, and violence that affects everyone, regardless of whether they're at the top or bottom of society. A truly great society is a society where everyone is equal, and no one truly believes they are above anyone else. Elysium may look like a beautiful paradise, but such a paradise can only last for so long when the world below looks as it does in this film. A well-deserved 3 stars.o cross the border illegally into America for a better chance at life and better healthcare.

B0054SMIH6|4.0|Other than the fact that Matthew McConaughey never lost his southern accent, it was a pretty good movie.  Some of the characters were not very well developed, and I never really did &#34;get&#34; the movie title in regard to him working out of his car (a Lincoln) - sort of a 'stretch'...sure he went to and from court in his vehicle and had a chauffeur, but...not title-worthy.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|i really like this game. it is cute and fun, but i have never been more insulted by people then when talking to the creators of this game. the game keeps crashing on me and talking acorns that i won. i can save up to a little over a hundred before it just happens again. i have lost around 700 acorns now and i emailed them each time it happened to me but they just called me a liar, there was no way i could have that many without buying them. maybe not, but i just got out of school in june, i have a lot of time on my hands. i play this a lot, its my fave kindle fire game. its cute and its fun, but i will NOT sit here and continue to be insulted by these people.<br />so yea due to the rudeness of the game creators/ support people i have removed two stars from my rating. if they were nicer and didnt keep messing around or being rude to me or ignoring all the complaints i have sent then this game would have all five stars.
B002VPE1WK|3.0|Great budget camera bag. Would be great for a novice photographer that doesn't want to spend $100+ on a camera bag. It is smaller than expected but I still use it when needed.<br /><br />Would recommend to a friend.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I recently purchased a Google Chromecast fob from Amazon and have been able to configure and use it with the Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  Side loading Chrome and the Chromecast apps was relatively easy to do.  To date I have been able to use netflix and youtube  , but not with the Chrome browser.  The experiment will continue as time allows.  The picture quality and streaming are fine.<br /><br />This is a concept that will drive more innovators to improve access to streaming web content, this and other solutions may be the beginning of the end cable of TV as we know it.  Maybe 2014 will be that year?  That alone deserves a rating of 4 or more stars!<br /><br />I hope that Amazon will allow use of Prime with this device and provide access to needed apps if possible.

B00DLKXF3A|3.0|Let me preface this review by stating that I have enjoyed every album that Avenged Sevenfold has put out to date.  I do not consider myself placed in \\"metalcore\\" version of this band only.  I fully enjoy the ballad type songs that have been released on the albums to date.  I am also well aware of the press released of this Album regarding it being a throwback album.<br /><br />What any review or personal opinion comes down to is if you personally enjoy the music being presented to you.  After listening to the album on repeat three+ times (I am listening to the album as I write this) I feel I have enough to write down my opinion of this album.  The first song I ever heard from this band was Trashed and Scattered which I found wonderfully complex.  The driving rythm.  The edgy vocals. The harmonic solos.  Combined these aspects created the essence that is Avenged Sevenfold.  This essence permiated through the albums released after regardless if the track was at a quicker tempo or a slower one.<br /><br />And herein lies my issue with this album.  It is my personal opinion the band went too far simplifying the song structure.  That wonderful complexity is not present.  It is a jarring change for me to listen to some of these songs.  It is still has M. Shadows blaring away but at a subduded, toned down level.  The drumming, at the forefront of the band's core sound, is also at subdued pace.  I was fully expecting the change to the rythm side but it is worth noting.  The guitar work is by far the most excellent aspect of the album.  And, for me, its saving grace.  It would be wrong to state that you cannot hear heavy influences to Iron Maiden, Metallica, GnR in the songs contained in this album.  It is there.  Whether or not it is too close to the source material I leave up to you.  During my first couple iterations through the album I heard distinct Metallica and GnR tones.  But not enough to sway me away from the album.<br /><br />In the end this album may be an aquired taste to some.  I will keep the ablum in my rotation to get a better feel for it. So far my favorite songs have been the radio tracks:  Hail to the King and This Means War.  I also enjoy Shepard of Fire, Heretic and Planets.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Loved the movie and the acting. It made you need to refresh yourself on your history! I would watch it again and recommend it to others.

B00E8B1P9M|3.0|It was exactly what I was expecting - lots of action, some fun dialogue (especially between The Rock and Channing Tatum) some plot holes to ignore, but just entertaining.  The fight scene on the mountains was especially well done - although hard for me to watch since I'm afraid of heights.

0061743526|5.0|This is one of the best stories of the 20th century. The movie with Gregory Peck from 1962 was a great adaptation; however, the book is even better. It is a &#34;must read&#34; for anyone who is interested in how people lived during the 1930's and the conflicts between race relatiions and how a lawyer in a small town with two small children tries to teach them right from wrong while overcoming the prejudice of the times. If you don't own a copy, please get and read this one, you will be glad you did.
B000002KCV|5.0|This is one seriously underrated Neil Young album. Much of the 70's was spent angst ridden in a series of albums known as The Ditch Trilogy (Time Fades Wasy, On The Beach, Tonight's The Night). He then followed that with the hard rocking Zuma and American Stars & Bars. \\"Like A Hurricane\\" being the summation. Here he stands in the eye of the storm taking stock.<br /><br />Released in 1978, Comes a Time could be seen as a lazy middle finger to a shifting musical landscape. The Sex Pistols and Television defined the cutting edge, eating the likes of James Taylor and Joni Mitchell alive for breakfast. Meanwhile, flashy, decadent Stadium Rock was in full ascendency. And here comes Neil with his sparse, doofy little Country record and a sly grin on his face.<br /><br />\\"Going Back\\" kicks off with \\"I feel like going back where there's no where to stay\\" revealing a restlessness behind the seemingly laid back, understated atmosphere. \\"Comes a time when you're drifin' \\" only reinforces the theme. \\"Look Out For My Love\\" burns close and haunting and while \\"Lotta Love\\" was a huge hit for Nicolette Larson, the original here with Crazy Horse has a rough, ragged quality that lends it edge. Elsewhere, the lonesome intimate \\"Peace Of Mind\\" is about anything but. And \\"Already One\\" is one of my all time favorite Neil Young songs. An aching but helpless song of acceptance. A Time Heals All Wounds song that quietly never got over breaking up. As a writer,Young reaches a whole new level of maturity here. \\"Motorcycle Mama\\" may be a toss off but is catchy as hell and am willing to bet you'll be singing it under your breath while standing in line. Before you know it he's following \\"Four Strong Winds\\" back to Alberta where the \\"weather's good there in the fall\\". It may all come and go like a breeze but there's some grit blowing in that wind and on occasion it can get stuck in your eye.<br /><br />Like Dylan's Nashville Skyline, Comes A Time is written off as a light, transitional album that stubbornly wants to stand behind the times as opposed to in the spotlight. But dig deeper and there's much more going on beneath the surface. One of his most misunderstood albums and all too often taken for granted. A rootsy work of rootlessness. A catch of the breath before launching into Rust Never Sleeps.tubbornly wants to stand behind the times as opposed to in the spotlight.

B004XUMMFE|5.0|No not the show itself, but the way it was treated by Fox.  It's funny, Fox used to be THE risk taking network.  Now if something doesn't take off like a rocket they burry it.  What's even more sad is that dispite how this show was treated during the half season run...it's still loved by legions of faithful fans, and even scored a feature length movie.<br /><br />Great storytelling, solid acting, and characters you'll fall in love with.<br /><br />Firefly is also getting a board game in September 2013.  I played a demo at GenCon, and decided to buy it.  Oddly enough, for a show with so little merit that they didn't even bother to air every episode...the 300 copies of the prerelease were sold completely out less than ten minutes after the exhibit hall opened on Thursday morning.<br /><br />The more time passes, the less likely a comeback seems, but Fox can't take the sky from me...here's to hoping.

193700788X|1.0|[SPOILER ALERT]<br /><br />I, like many I suppose, began reading these after HBO developed the series into True Blood. At first the series couldn't compare to the books, then it became the books could compare to the series. Then it became I only kept reading the books because I kept hoping they'd return to what they'd been. But alas, the romance, the excitement, the great love scenes with Bill then Eric, Eric especially, were gone. Replaced by pedantic small life town details where the interesting characters just stop by once in a blue moon.<br /><br />The killer was the ending. Out of the characters and possibilities for Sookie, she's going to end up with Sam? I like Same as a character, but not as a romantic interest. He's more like a cousin or something. The one love scene there is in the book is lousy. Sookie stops by Merlotte's in a bikini on a hot and humid Louisiana day. Sam just happens to be doing yard work on this hot and humid day. They're both sweaty, so of course that fires the hormones right up? They go inside, and almost with no prelude, have sex. This wasn't romantic, sensual or anything else.<br /><br />So you take an extraordinary character and stick her with a bar owner to live out her days in a relationship that has all the passion of an insurance seminar. That's not why I read books like this. I'm happily married, but I want to live vicariously, if only for a few hours. No surprise from Eric or Bill or anyone. Boo! Now I'm addicted to the True Blood series because they've kept more to the spirit of the first few books (Alan Ball I hope you read this) because if you follow Harris's lead HBO will cancel ya!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|The book is amazing no doubt about it, I was defiantly wiping tears from my face a few times but the only thing that bothered me was how unrealistic Augustus and Hazel were.

Enjoyable and reminiscent of older style movies with 21 century effects.<br /><br />A &#34;Good vs Evil&#34; Graphic movie.  Enjoy it!!

B000PGTPE6|5.0|I am not a big fan of Bruce Springsteen but absolutely love this recording. It is one of the best collections of superb musicians and classic old time songs that I have in my varied and extensive collection of music. I have a number of CDs/DVDs that I go back to from time to time and this one is one of them. If there were 6 stars in the Amazon rating system, I would give it 6 stars. If you only want the CD or DVD, I recommend the DVD. Seeing the musicians play adds another dimension of joy. There are great trumpet, trombone, saxophone, piano, violin, accordion, and guitar solos to savor along with multiple singers including Bruce. Buy it and I don't believe you will be disappointed if you like great bands playing great music.

B00AREIAI8|3.0|It's fun<br />Because it keeps you entertained<br />I like it<br />Even for a free game<br />I loove animals<br />Plus the horse is cute<br />Makes me want one<br />It's cute, entertaining and awesome<br />It's cool<br />I like taking care of stuff
B00190N4E4|5.0|Gandhi is an excellent portrayal of one of the world's greatest leaders.  Watching it led to some deep discussions in our family.
B006M4F67A|4.0|Mahjong is an addictive game.  I find that the tiles are a little small on this app.  It does not have the hint of how many matches are left which I find quite useful on others.
B00018D44U|5.0|Can she even put out a bad album? Wish she would release more albums,  as she has such a unique style and talented.  Love listening to her musi when I am driving long distances.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game is well worth the money spent.  Pretty easy to navigate.  The only negative would be objects that are listed under a different name.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|Season 1 hooked me, and Season 2 was just as good.  There are a few slower episodes in the mix, but that's the case for about any show.
B005ZI306S|5.0|My ten year old son loved this book. Filled with fun rhymes about superstitions this is a lovely read to share aloud with children, or even on your own!<br />The stories are enjoyable and filled with memorable characters.<br />I know we will be reading this many more times.
B0049OSQ18|5.0|Really so much better than this band's previous work. The songwriting and production places them firmly in the Americana genre and they do it very well. Bravo. I love this album! Had to go to google for a couple of references and that is what I love about Colin Meloy's lyrics. Keep us thinking, Colin!
B006PKV2QU|5.0|When I reached the end of this rhyming story, my three year old son cried: 'again, again!'.<br />I think that sums up our experience of this book. It is a beautifully illustrated, fun read which generated lots of questions from my son. What more could I ask for?<br />I'm sure we will indeed read it repeatedly.
1581804849|5.0|Great reference book for one stroke  painting.  I have added it to my reference library for one stroke painting and have painted many of the flowers illustrated in it.
B00138CYD4|5.0|Classic tracks and more contemporary ones. Everyone is good for a chill on a summer afternoon. Get out the Tecquila
B007PBKG5G|5.0|They have it, they bring it, can not wait to see them live! Very good rootsy, bluesy band with lots of energy.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Just what I was wanting, not exactly their best but a good imitation of their best. God is Dead is classic
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I am a new fan of Crouch's work and this book did not disappoint!!  A great thriller and a quick read.
0345803493|3.0|Fifty shades darker Book had about 20-30 pages curled together. But overall it was a good book and excellent read.
B001NLL93W|4.0|This is a good book (and series), but the writing style needs a bit more editing. I really love the ideas and how to plots began to develop.
B00DU74U74|1.0|I bought this to rent. I got 10 minutes into it and I literally had to stop watching it. I even like bad movies sometimes... this was god awful
B008P3I4VG|5.0|Of Mice and Men was assigned summer reading for my child. It's great to get another classic along with it. Great price AND - reduce, reuse, re-read/recycle.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This is a true blue period drama with quirky characters. I dig it. Like all things BBC. Too bad it was cancelled in the 4th season.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|would recommend to a friend or co-worker, would like to see her write more novels. will wait for her next novel
B002N6BHAQ|4.0|This book is a must read and must study for any who care to help a marriage in trouble and one that is going well.  There are always rough spots and this helps so much if you take the time to work with what is written.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Good game although objects tough to see. Like the fact that you have to solve puzzles as well as finding objects.
B000L43QJ2|4.0|The Swan Lake of the Paris Opera is one of the best productions of this ballet I ever saw (though until now I've never seen a perfect one). <br />The magic of Nureyev's version lies in the swan-scenes. Not only is the synchronity of the parisian corps de ballet breathtaking to watch but Nureyev's choreography for the long slow &#34;parade&#34; of the swans in the fourth act is of utter beauty and melancholy. <br />The weak points of the production are the party-scenes. To make his version more dark and mysterious Nureyev ordered costumes that were rather pale and unglamorous. These costumes, the minimalistic staging and the dull lighting do indeed eliminate the air of happiness and festivity. But what stays of long party scenes without a party going on? The soloists are all beautiful dancers but they haven't got a chance to impress since the cheerful atmosphere they are supposed to create is banned by the choreographer. <br />This means that this version depends almost entirely on the principal dancers. Agnès Letestu is, in my opinion, a glorious Odette. This is not a little princess but a real, mature queen. Anguished and humiliated, her eyes filled with suffer and grief she managed to move me deeply, even though the choreography doesn't always give her free reign to express herself (Nureyev was never good in choreographing emotional scenes). Her dancing is if of utter beauty and refinement with magnificent arm-movements and brillant technique.<br />José Martinez gives a very soft and dreamy interpretation of the prince. In the final scene one would maybe wish him to be more passionate in his fight with the wizard (that Siegfried loses here) but one has to admit that the strange choreography of this scene once again makes it difficult for the dancers to move the public as intensely as in some other versions. <br />Still all in all this production is very satisfying and needs to be seen for the magic of the swan-scenes and for the moving presence of their queen.
B004NEY9EW|5.0|very good movie, very entertaining, one of my favorite james bond movies, i will watch it again in the future
B003F29D44|5.0|Too often moives and books on wall street delve into the details. Wall Street shows the essential failings of people.
B00C28J2VQ|4.0|This second movie was better then the first.  The lines were a little cheesy but the action was spot on.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I will admit to not reading these until i watched the series. This explains alot and really brings more to watching the series.
B0009A21R6|5.0|Not only one of the best albums out of the 80's and Dire Strait's catalog, this presentation is mind boggling. &#34;Why Worry&#34;. &#34;Brothers in Arm&#34; and &#34;Your Latest Trick&#34; give you goosebumps. If you have a 5.1 system and player. this CD is a must have! You will not be disappointed!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Loved the second season almost as much as the first. A few of the plot lines have played their course, but otherwise, great season. Be ready for heartbreak.
B000002UTI|5.0|Buy this for the previously unreleased &#34;Real Love&#34;<br /><br />Both this and the film of the same name are a must have for any Beatles / John Lennon fan.
B00821PCJS|1.0|The aliens have heavily armed and armored robots. They have aircraft and spacecraft. But they travel by walking everywhere. Alone. Unarmed. Naked.<br /><br />Science fiction with almost no noticeable special effects. Apparently, there is one alien costume, one killer robot animation, one alien aircraft animation, and a picture of an alien structure.<br /><br />It's the 21st century but the only cars and trucks that work were built in 1975. And there are a lot of them, all in great condition. And there's plenty of gasoline.<br /><br />Your group is occupying a school, where many of the rooms have no windows. But there's plenty of light. Because obviously the destruction of civilization and the killing of almost everyone wouldn't affect the power grid.<br /><br />So, you've captured one of the enemy and are holding it in a cage. Whatever you do, don't post a guard.<br /><br />A group of you are collecting food from a dark, probably enemy-infested warehouse. Split up, of course.<br /><br />A group of you have accompanied a hostile person to a motorcycle dealership. One of you should definitely go into the garage alone with the hostile person.<br /><br />Fire all your bullets at the bulletproof killer robots, even though the only thing that ever accomplishes is getting their attention. I am wondering how the robots always know from which direction the bullets were fired.<br /><br />You see a bunch of heavily armed, mind-controlled humans coming toward you. Stand in front of them, of course, and wait for them to get within range so they can shoot you.<br /><br />Your brother, with whom you've never gotten along, was captured and now you have an all-consuming need to rescue him even if it means risking the lives of yourself and everyone else. Your girlfriend, with whom you're in love, was captured (when you went to rescue your brother). I'm sorry. Who?<br /><br />Of course, the aliens have no way of finding you as you walk en masse through open terrain in broad daylight every day.<br /><br />99 and 44/100 % of humans have been killed by aliens. And the rest of us still can't get along. Okay. Here's a thought. If you're in a group of people struggling to survive in a hostile environment and one person in your group is a trouble maker threatening the survival of everyone else -- shoot him in the head. And when a trouble making idiot gets killed as a result of his own stupidity, don't cry about how good a person he was deep inside -- thank God for Darwinism.
B008RTE066|5.0|This box set was worth every penny I spent! All of the extra goodies and pictures make this box set perfect for the rabid Beatles fan. Magical Mystery Tour on Blu-Ray is incredible.
0062255657|2.0|I suppose Neil Gaiman is quite creative and original and that's the only reason I gave this book 2 stars rather than 1. I am uncertain what all the hype is about surrounding this book. It was bizarre and a waste of time, but thankfully it was brief or else I would not even have finished it.
B007JWKLP6|5.0|This is a masterpiece and a must have for the George Harrison fan! Beautifully done, with interviews from George's friends make this an intimate look at the quiet Beatle. If you get this, also pick up the Concert for George. Both are feel good films about a man that loved the world and brought us beautiful music!
B004ZN9RWK|5.0|Would wouldn't like to hear airplanes/space ships flying around the room? This CD is awesome as only Pink Floyd can make things come alive!
B0068FYZCA|5.0|Blu-Ray and a remastering of the sound track make this a must have. Set it up in 5.1 and you are in heaven. A timeless classic!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I liked the Kite Runner and this as well……a story of a culture that until recent years we here knew little about
B000JJS8TM|5.0|You have to let this release grow on you. When I first listened to it I was not a fan, but after giving it some time I really like what they did with the numbers and the flow of songs. It is now one of my favorites. And it is the only Beatles release in 5.1. A must have for a Bealtes fan!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I PLAY THIS MORE THAN ANY OF THE GAMES, BEST ENJOYABLE ANIMAL GAME, LAND BUILDING, SITE SEEING, FRIEND CONNECTING, COIN MAKING GAME EVER, IT KEEPS YOU COMING BACK AND WANTING MORE, ITS THE BEST SINCE FARMVILLE ON FACEBOOK,YOU WILL LOVE IT TO, it's GREAT. YOU HAVE TO TRY IT, OH YES!  LOOK ME UP TO BE FRIENDS WE CAN BUILD OFF EACH OTHER, I'll BE  WAITING.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|There are hundreds of hours of audio from the Let it Be sessions. They did a nice job with this one giving us the raw versions of the songs before Phil Spector got his hands on them. This CD is one of my personal favorites.
B009AY04A8|3.0|Lots of talking. Yawn. Can't zoom in on my Fire HD. Same old same old Nevosoft games. Glad I didn't pay for it.
B00064X3BI|5.0|5.1 heaven! Clapton's masterpiece in 5.1 is incredible. You feel like the man is in the room with you. The song &#34;The Core&#34; is worth the price of the CD. A must have for Clapton fans!
B0091THRCU|5.0|This is a great little sleeve. I just upgraded to the iPhone 5, and like the 4, I wanted another leather sleeve as I prefer them to a big bulky plastic case. The first sleeve I ordered was too tight, but customer service acted quickly to send me a second case free of charge which arrived a couple days later and fit perfectly! Thanks Snugg for your excellent customer service and great product.
B001TH16DI|5.0|I received this as a gift, and I am a lifelong TOS fan. The films in Blu-Ray are incredible. But had I had the choice I would have bought the titles I liked. I am not a big fan of the first film. But II, III, and iV and fantastic. Having the others is nice, but if you are a die hard fan, pick it up. If not, pick up the titles you like separately.
B0054TKB8I|5.0|This show was already in its 3rd season when I decided to watch an episode.  I had heard very good reviews of the show, and when my wife and I watched the first episode we enjoyed it.  As we progressed through the season, the writing became better and better, and the storyline was increasingly interesting.  While the CG of the Alpha werewolf is a little disappointing, there have been some very spooky scenes.<br /><br />My advice is that if you are a horror or werewolf fan, try this show out for a few episodes.  I think you will be surprised by how good it is.
B0079J28NW|5.0|It does not get any better than this! The vivid color and sound are a visual trip! A masterpiece finally given the medium it deserves. I can only hope that they release Let It Be!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|It is a fun game to play. Plenty of free gifts and credits given daily. Collect items in each room for more daily credits.<br />One of the best bingo games I've played!
B002T9H2L0|5.0|Finally a film that is not afraid to push the envelope on changing the norm. A pleasure from start to finish with superb acting, and storyline.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|this was a really great book, i couldn't put it down. i would recommend it for all ages and cant waig for the next book.
B002M9WW30|5.0|How could you not like any of these films. I grew up with these films and the Blu-Ray releases are awesome! I love every single one!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love, love this book!! One of the best series you'll ever read!! I would recommend this series of books!! Buy this series!
B005WQ4RP6|4.0|Hard for me to watch at times because I'm a little whimpy, but I really did like it, great acting.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Reading this book gave me a better insight to the Apple products and the thought and work behind each items.  As a a side note just who was this man Steve Jobs and what drove him.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Amazing movie, great on it's own whether or not you're a Trek fan, or if you're just a movie lover.
B000GCFBQU|4.0|I am happy I discovered this author. I have enjoyed every book of hers I have read. Her books and characters make me think of them long after finishing them. This is my mark of an excellent read.
0425268284|5.0|This book exemplifies what great fantasy novels are made of and I am blown away that Anthony Ryan produced a book of this caliber right out the gate.  Most authors takes YEARS to reach this level of writing.  The story is fast paced and characters are fleshed out to such a degree you can actually picture their faces.  There is no fumbling about on Ryan's part with regards to progressing the story arc... he knew exactly where he was going and how to get there before this book was put to paper.  There's a strange eerie feeling he was simply retelling a story that truly did already happen.
B00EE3FVSU|3.0|While I would say that the acting is excellent, the story line is extremely heavy and to me it is depressing.  We decided not to watch anymore of the episodes.
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|This is one-of-a-kind app that is fun, challenging,  it has beautiful graphics!  Entertainment for the entire family.  I'm completely hooked on Candy Crush!!!!<br /><br />`
B00DYESRZY|5.0|Funny that you can't use a band's actual name in a review or it will get caught in guidelines. Censorship is fun!<br /><br />Anyway, this record is Eff Buttons's best album. They debuted in 2008 as a rather coherent power electronics-type outfit on the standout Street Horrrsing, a record that definitely put the band on my radar. They followed it up by doing a massive 180 into techno influenced music while keeping the atmospherics and exploration of noise and feedback on the following year's Tarot Sport, which is how most people found out about Eff Buttons. That music from that album was used in the closing ceremonies of the London Olympics points to how different their sound had become.<br /><br />Eff Buttons then took 4 years away from releasing records and has this year come back with the masterful Slow Focus which is the best demonstration of their aesthetic yet. They are no longer a noise band although they still clearly revel in large noise, but have become very much a sort of experimental techno outfit in the same general vein of the more experimental side of Warp Records. Their composition skills have improved greatly and many of the tracks on here are downright melodic under the layers of dread and distortion.<br /><br />I don't want to spend much time describing the actual sound of the record since it's so unique, but needless to say if you enjoyed Eff Buttons previous releases, are interested in power electronics or ambient noise recordings like Kevin Drumm, or experimental techno like Autechre or Actress, you're going to find a lot of ideas you're going to really latch onto with this album. Hell even if you're not, check it out, this might be the album that gets you into Merzbow eventually.
B00006RAKP|5.0|I played this DVD so much I may need to order another. Songs remind me of when I was younger and life was uncomplicated.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|this is the best fps there is on the android market the price is absolutely fair as it is just like call of duty but mobile no doubt that it has the best multiplayer experience. theres even clans! also only issue is lag sometimes but very rarely. 5 stars all the way. btw i play on kindle fire hd. :)
B005D7ECMM|5.0|I havent seen this movie for years. It is a great addition to my collection!I havent seen this movie for years. It is one of my favorites. It is a great addition to my collection!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Amazing book, I really enjoyed reading it. Was thought provoking and interesting while throwing in the different experiences some people face during high school. Very nicely written.The movie captures it nicely as well.
B009AY04A8|4.0|I LIKE THE FACT THAT THE SEARCHES CHANGE WITH EACH LEVEL .  I also like that there are little side games that are variations in the game.  Fun stuff.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|It took me a bit to get into the spirit of the challenges, but when I finally realized what I was facing, it was a blast! Had me obsessed in the end!
0553384775|4.0|It's hard to believe that this is a true story but I know it is. Anyone who has consumed that amount of drugs should not be alive to tell about it. The story did get a little tedious at times when it seemed like certain parts were nothing but drugs and sex, drugs and sex. However I thought it was interesting enough to want to read his follow up book.
B008602KQI|2.0|I thought the movie was thrown together with poor casting, poor staging and not good.  The book was much better.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was slow going at first, but once I got a few chapters in, I couldn't stop myself. After that, only took 4 days to read....which is quick when you have a 4.year old!
B004X2M3N8|5.0|Love it, love all dr who! Classic and the new ones! I really enjoyed river song and hope they dont write off the chacter with the new doctor.
