0316017930|5.0|Very interesting book about the most famous and wealthy people and how they got to be that way. The author has great stories with awesome characters that are very memorable. I would recommend this book to anyone and have loaned it out to my girl friend and Dad and they both loved it.

B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|Downloaded this movie via the internet to my TIVO.  Good storyline for kids and adults alike.  At first it seemed like a &#34;girl&#34; movie, but my son really liked it too.
B005LAIGNC|2.0|The Tuskegee airmen offer an inspiring, heroic story. Brave men fighting the bigotry many of their own countrymen and the Nazis while armed only with antiquated aircraft. It sounds like the formula for a rousing tale, yet none of this dramatic tension appears on the screen. The dialog is contrived and inappropriate for the period. Military discipline and procedures are very inaccurately portrayed. The plethora of characters are either played as stereotypes or barely developed. From the unit's commander to the the evil enemy fighter pilot, there is no emotional depth to generate the viewer's interest. The flight sequences are occasionally interesting, but also seem fragmented and poorly paced. It is simply hard to generate any lasting enthusiasm for a movie in which the best sight is a P-51 Mustang and the best sound is a Merlin engine.

B009S8PEHY|5.0|Is there any thing that Rod Stewart can not do well?<br /><br />I grew up in the 1970's and '80's and he was the IT singer of those decades, with hits like 'Maggie May'  'Hot Legs' and ''Forever Young.' My parents even bought his music and played it at parties.<br /><br />Fast forward to the new Millenium and he reinvented himself as a jazz artist with a string of successful cd's. I loved the 'Bewitched' duet with Cher.<br /><br />Now we have his Christmas CD and coupled with David Foster producing, he has another successful go at something new. Among my favorites on this album are: Auld Lang Syne (a bit of an Irish feel), We three kings, What are you doing Christmas Eve (a virtual duet with Ella Fitzgerald), and my absolute favorite Red-Suited Santa Claus (I have to dance to this one).<br /><br />Cheers to Rod Stewart to making this Christmas even brighter!!!
B0084BMUFA|4.0|Awesome  I love this book so much Dickens is truly a genius. Have read this many times before and this was the best one!
B005KJZDXK|2.0|Zoey Deschanel has such a beautiful voice, but this album needs a better arrangement. The songs are too bland and boring for me. In the future I'd like to see her pair with a producer that's as good as she is.

0060873027|3.0|This book was entertaining enough to keep reading to the end, but as many others have noted--is not really up to the standards one expects from either author.  Nano-technology is a fascinating field, one that has made many scientific advances, but one must stretch mentally to accept the concept of shrinking humans to fit the storyline.  I agree with many other reviewers here that the characters lacked depth or richness and tended to fit into stereotypical archetypes.  However, the challenges one would meet as a shrunken being in the sub-tropical ecosystem of Hawaii were real enough to keep the story moving and fascinating.  Yes, beetles, spiders, centipedes, etc. of the insect world, along with natural events such as a morning rain creates a whole new survival tension for humans based on their shrunken size.  This was the fun part of reading this book, and made you turn the pages.<br /><br />The greatest weakness of this book was in the believability of the storyline itself, and how the characters moved into the situation.  The saving grace comes in allowing yourself to become immersed in a new perspective of what life might be like if we were small creatures in the world, instead of our current size.  What dangers might lurk in our world, if you are the size of a wasp?  Once you make that leap mentally, it becomes entertaining.  The scientists' areas of expertise become your lifeline to survival in this immersion and thus, are necessary, if you accept journeying with them.  If you can make that leap, you can enjoy the read.

B004SJ3AXI|3.0|My grandchildren enjoy playing this game and we have fun with  it together, otherwise I have no further comment to make
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|Every frame of this is packed with smart dialogue, imagination, style, action, drama, and adventure. It steals liberally from Bogart, Han Solo, Buck Rogers, Total Recall, Logan's Run, Matrix, and both Battlestar Galactica series, but in a diverse way.  My only gripe is the captain and gunner overact, but probably know they're going down in a blaze of glory, forever banished to tv roles.

B002EBDP9G|5.0|A history teacher in college first introduced me to the outstanding writings of Paul Johnson, and I have been wanting to purchase and read this particular book for sometime. Johnson is a conservative historian (as opposed to revisionist), and if a conservative, traditional history of America interests you, then you ought to choose this book. While I am in the process of reading this book now, I can say that, thus far, the Kindle Fire edition appears to be of high quality.
B002R0F3Q2|5.0|arrived on time even arrived early haven't listen to it yet but shouldn't be any problem. so far very good on time wise.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|This is the most beautiful music and, yes, sexy too. I think you will enjoy listening and letting this music take you where you want to go.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|I liked the video. It was action packed and a little thin on plot line. What do you want for a movie based an a comic book? The actors seemed to try to hard to make the movie more than it was...no oscar nominations here. It killed a couple of hours of down time for me.
B003CN4R74|5.0|You might expect that the problem with Evanescence's third album of epic goth theater is that Lee's band hold her back. Instead, it's that they don't hold her back enough; she hops to an intense peak the second a song allows, and often doesn't return. Imagine if fireworks didn't burst or fade, but just hung there like frozen flowers.<br /><br />This album could best be described as goth rock with elements of nu metal and a lot of electronic and string instrumentation added in for an almost chamber pop feel to it. While in the past the instrumentation was almost solely used for creating the right atmosphere to act as scenery for Amy Lee's voice, the instrumentation has taken a more important role having interesting elements of its own.<br /><br />Also, on this album there is now some harp added in, which is played by Amy Lee. Probably about half the songs are heavier, with good riffs and guitar lines, and a few simple yet effective guitar solos. The other half of the songs is more electronica or acoustic (with piano and/or harp as the main instrumentation).<br /><br />This is a solid album, in my opinion. Unlike their last effort, which seemed more like a soundtrack, the orchestral elements are not pushed to the forefront but instead complimentary to what the band is playing. Hopefully they can keep this formula of collaborative writing going. The melodies are strong, the rhythm section is much improved, and hopefully they can keep this unit together for a full tour and writing cycle. There's an energy here that's been lacking with them since Fallen.<br /><br />\\"What you Want\\" is not a good indication of this album, much like \\"Call Me When You're Sober\\" didn't give a good impression of the last one. \\"Erase this,\\" \\"Oceans,\\", and \\"The Change\\" are highlights to me. Adding the bonus tracks, I would give it an 9/10.
B008MM9630|5.0|great game. But i wish there was a reliable place to share spells and ask questions or search a database.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this is a very fun game to play and kill time on your cell phone. Only problem is it runs continuously in the back ground and taps your battery. if you use a program  to kill apps that run like this you will be using  t a lot.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Really, what more needs to be said about this movie?  That I watched it 9 times in theatres, or that I eagerly ripped into the package as soon as it arrived?  Or that I appreciated Amazon's price matching, since the price dropped from when I ordered it to when it was delivered?  Really, all that needs to be said is that this is an AMAZING movie, with great special effects, and awesome extra features.  Buy it!!!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great Book...Keep them coming...On the second book now and loving it. If you love 50 Shades, you will love this one

B00079HZUM|5.0|I was sad that at least one reviewer criticizes this movie because it's about a \\"gay man who changes his mind\\".  According to Wikipedia, this movie was based on the real person Edward Kynaston, who was a male stage actor who played both male and female characters.  He was an actor at a transitional time when women were finally allowed on stage. Also according to Wikipedia, off the stage he was linked to both men and women.  I loved this movie because everything about it was unconventional.  It was both funny and heartbreaking.  The dialogue was witty, and the plot was never boring.  The acting was pretty fantastic, too.  I even watched this one a couple more times before sending the rental DVD back; I only do that with the movies I truly enjoy.

B009LDXQGC|4.0|For long time fans this cd has little to offer other than a few new songs that can likely be purchased seperately. For those new to the group for some unknown reason or those that just want the radio hits, it should suffice. The cd includes the group's nine #1 hit songs and three new tracks. There were some other hits that would have been better inclusions than the new tracks and made the compliation more complete. Those tracks being \\"The Road I'm On\\", \\"Citizen Soldier\\", \\"Let Me Be Myself\\", \\"Landing In London\\", and \\"When We Were Young\\" (as the lone inclusion from their last disc).
B005COO1X6|3.0|For a short story, it was okay.  Kind of reminds me of a good scary campfire story. Stephen King is one of my favorites so what can i say... can't really knock a free read. I found myself on the verge of giggling during some moments... just trying to envision the car chomping.

B005CRQ4GU|5.0|! He spend 3 days reading it all on he's kindle and we paid less on amazon.com. Love the book.
0545123275|4.0|My impression on this first book was kind of a mixed bag. On the positive side, I still really like Maggie Stiefvater's writing. She has a great way of pulling a reader into the story and describing things in ways that are almost tangible. Of course, a huge part of Shiver revolves around the highly unpleasant sensation of being cold, which I hate, so sometimes I kind of wish her writing had been a little less visceral...but that's what I get for reading a book called Shiver. That's really much more my problem than the book's.<br /><br />I liked Grace and Sam (Sam probably a bit more than Grace), and while the book alternated their first-person points-of-view, I never found their rotating voices confusing. Each had their own distinctive ways of thinking and reacting (Do emo rockers really make up spontaneous song lyrics all the time? Is that a thing?) and I actually found it a bit refreshing to not stay with the same character the whole way through the story. I think either of them on their own for the entire book would have been a bit much, as both of them are preeeetty intense and kind of obsessive. So switching was good.<br /><br />I also liked the way the werewolf mythology was handled. It was an interesting take on the archetype, presented very straightforwardly without a lot of bells and whistles. The characters even say on several occasions that the transformation from human to wolf is scientific, not magical (although it never really does explore this supposed \\"science,\\" which kind of takes away from that argument). But I like that the origin story of the wolves was not the focus. They simply were werewolves, which they dealt with, then moved on.<br /><br />Now the parts I wasn't so sold on. First, Grace's obsession with the wolves is creeeeepy. Seriously, the girl really should have been in therapy for most of her life. She had a crush on a wolf. A wolf she had no idea was human for several months out of the year. So basically, she has a romantic attraction to an animal and this is somehow okay because we know he's a wolf. But she doesn't.<br /><br />Sam does the same thing. At one point, another character asks them how long they've been going out, and he answers \\"six years.\\" Grace muses, \\"Of course he would count the time that we'd been two entirely different species.\\" (p.282)<br /><br />WHY `OF COURSE'? WHY WOULD YOU COUNT THE TIME WHEN YOU WERE DIFFERENT SPECIES AS `GOING OUT'? WHY IS THIS NOT EXTREMELY CREEPY?<br /><br />And this leads to my other issue with the book, which is because they both are apparently under the impression that they were carrying on some sort of romantic relationship while Sam was a wolf -- and Grace had no idea he could turn into a human -- they plunge right into a super-serious relationship the second he turns human. Even though their entire scope of interaction until that point has been staring at each other across her backyard. WHILE HE WAS A WOLF. This is now something on which to base a deep, borderline-obsessive relationship, apparently. It seemed very instalovey to me, and I know it's not supposed to because of the aforementioned wolfy staring, but I just can't count that as the basis for any sort of healthy human relationship.<br /><br />So. Obviously that bothered me. And their obsession with each other really was a significant portion of the book, which means a significant portion of the book bothered me.<br /><br />However. I will read the rest of the series, and not just out of obligation. See, I'm pretty sure that I'll only ever have to experience Grace and Sam \\"falling in love\\" (while he is a four-legged furry animal) in this first book. Hopefully subsequent books focus on other parts of the story, like the interesting secondary characters, and the aftermath of the end of this book (which is a pretty solid ending), and the other werewolves. And those are all things I'm interested in reading about.to an animal and this is somehow okay because we know he's a wolf. But she doesn't.<br /><br />Sam does the same thing.

B009WO7NQO|2.0|The idea of a Star Wars Angry Birds game is fun, and the game moves along similarly to other Angry Birds games (though with some added fun of using the force, a light sabre, and a blaster, just to name a few) through Tatooine and the Death Star levels.  However, the $1.99 upgrade you have to purchase to move on to the third level &#34;Path of the Jedi&#34; is lame.  It would have been better to require the purchase of additional content beyond what was initially furnished with the game; however, the Path of the Jedi level is there for all to see immediately after you purchase the initial game, and you are not told you have to spend the additional 2 bucks until you get to it.  Either charge the full $6.98 up front, or be up front about the $1.99 upgrade - the way they've done it is a little underhanded.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|classic film never gets old & i always was a fan of tim burton & who was never a fan of beetlejuice
B00A3AYI50|5.0|I gotta talk about \\"Wicked Game\\" first - never thought anyone could sing that as good as Chis Isaak, but Phillip Phillips slammed it - it's equally haunting but a totally different song. I fell in love with that song all over again because it's a whole new song.<br /><br />Most of these are original songs - I've listened to whole album once now - enjoyed every song, some more than others. But the whole album is strong.<br /><br />I like all the songs, but some of my favorites are: Wanted is Love, Drive Me, Home, Man on the Moon, Gone Gone Gone - ok nevermind it seems most of them are my favorites LOL.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|coin dozed is very fun to play. it is extremely  addictive just like the quarter slot. you start playing and u don't want to stop. you do run out of money fast but if you want to u can spend real money to get more fast if u want to or u can wait for the game to give u more.

B008FPOIT6|5.0|Mr. Penumbra's was a fun, quick read.  The characters were likable and the story line was engaging.  The written dialog was modern, sometimes to a fault.  I didn't particularly like the inner quips the main character used as inner monologue, but I am sure younger readers will find it conversational.<br /><br />The society in the book was fun to read about and quite imaginative.  The book had a satisfying ending. I would certainly recommend it to everyone who likes a good mystery.
B008Y1RTUG|4.0|I liked the movie enough to buy. Amazons service is tops. Buy-rent-stream or<br />Download. you can't ask for better. Amazon Prime an incredible deal. I do wish<br />You could stream to an android device though. But adobe flash is not<br />Compatible on my android devices.

B008AK8FHM|3.0|I've read a number of these types of books since my wife's death.  While this is the most \\"rational\\" of these books, it falls short of proof.  But then proof for me, may have to be when I die.  Dr Alexander provides one of the more detailed accounts of what happened to him and while it differs from others I've read, it is also remarkably similar in the overall structure of the experience.<br /><br />My question to all authors in this genre is, do we really want proof?  If we had proof that heaven is a fact and not a belief of some, then would we see an increase in suicide?  Would more people give up, instead of fighting to recover?

B004L03B3S|5.0|Five stars is not enough! I give it way more!<br /><br />This movie was full of heart, joy, laughter, positivity, and love. I fell in love with Thomas and Francisco, and wept tears of joy at the end! It's a tender love story between two soulmates who just happen to inhabit the bodies of two half brothers. This movie is very controversial because it deals with taboo subject matter, but if you can look past all that and remember that it's just a story, and try to enjoy the love and joy these two share in thier relationship, and see just how happy and content they are to be together, then you'll be able to enjoy this movie &#34;from beginning to end&#34;.  ;) Filled with heartwarming scenes between the two, and an endearing and loving family they belong to, this movie is a must.<br /><br />I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. Just give it a chance. I guarantee, you will not be disappointed. I know I certainly wasn't! I'll watch this one over and over again!  :)

B007THA4FI|5.0|Not what you expect after reading the Harry Potter books. Very British writing, dry humour, wonderful insight. Loved it. Disturbing and shocking at times, but good to challenge your thinking especially in regards to teenager world. Recommend!
B00973DDN2|4.0|Not my favorite killers album but I bought it because I'm a diehard fan. The album has a few good songs I love atomic bomb and runaway! I kinda want them to go back to their old style and roots though.
B004SC7B6M|5.0|So, I've been listening to this album nonstop for about a month now, and it still isn't old. That's because each song, though not all of the same caliber, is catchy enough and varies in tempo and style so as to flow well within the whole album, if that makes sense.<br /><br />I was first introduced to WT a few years ago, beginning with \\"The Silent Force,\\" which I think is their best album. I love that genre of music, but didn't quite enjoy their next album, \\"The Heart of Everything.\\" I think it is because I prefer lyrical symphonic rock rather than the metal side of it. But with \\"The Unforgiving,\\" WT returns to the style I really enjoy - upbeat music with great guitar and drum solos, with a few lovely slower melodies as a change of pace. Not to mention, this album features two of the catchiest songs ever - \\"Iron\\" and \\"A Demon's Fate.\\"<br /><br />If you liked \\"The Silent Force,\\" I think you'll like this album. I can really hear the 80's sound in songs like \\"Sinead\\" and \\"Faster,\\" and I'm happy that the band chose to try something new (classic?) with \\"The Unforgiving.\\" Sharon's vocals are great as always, and you'll notice that most of the songs here are in a lower register, whereas songs from \\"The Silent Force\\" tended to be in a higher one. Her versatility is impressive! I hope their next album comes soon.
1451696191|4.0|Beautiful book. Nice refresher of the younger years using a different angle. I thought it was hillarious at times and extremely moving as well. Glad I was able to add this book to the memorable collection of books I will cherish forever.
1616960922|5.0|I have recently read every book he has written.  He creates incredibly imaginative worlds.  The Way of Kings was one of my favorites and I can't wait to read the second book in the series.  Keep up the good work Brandon!
B009NUV0E8|5.0|Most Bond fans probably don't realize that the Bond films have switched directors with every film for the last two decades. Only one director, Martin Campbell, has directed more than one film those being Casino Royale and Goldeneye. They are also, in my opinion, the two best films from their respective eras (no offense to Skyfall which was a great movie). The Daniel Craig movies did to the Pierce Brosnan films what Christopher Nolan did to the Burton/Schumacher Batman films; made them look ridiculous. Alone in standing the test of time was Brosnan's first and by far best film as Bond; Goldeneye.<br /><br />Goldeneye started the Pierce Brosnan era with a ton of promise. Judy Densch as M created an entirely new dynamic and her referring to Bond as a \\"misogynist dinosaur, a relic of the cold war\\" really set the tone for the movie. With the cold war over the villains in the world became less clear and it was only appropriate that this time the threat should come from one of MI6's own. There is also some Bond deconstruction with Alec Trevelyan pointing out that those sexual dalliances Bond's engaged in over the years have personal consequences on people involved. It brought some reality to the series, not that most of the rest of Goldeneye isn't escapist fun. Just about everything in Goldeneye is done well from the story to the casting and directing. In the next three films the directors seemed to ignore everything that worked in Goldeneye and accentuated everything that didn't. In particular I was never a big fan of the scene in the archives where Bond suddenly becomes a one man army but sadly THAT ended up being the scene that is most representative of the Brosnan films.<br /><br />There are some absolutely fantastic scenes in Goldeneye including one of my all time favorites, the memorial park scene where Sean Bean is revealed as the villain. For over the top action you can hardly do better than the tank chase scene through St. Petersburg which finishes off with the amazing tank vs train collision. The cradle is one of the best villain lairs although it always amused me that Trevelyan feels the need to build this gigantic dish. A giant dish is used to receive signals not send signals. Are we to assume that the Goldeneye satellite will detonate BETTER if controlled by an enormous dish? I loved the entire opening sequence from the bungee jump to the leap into a falling plane. Ok, the green screening on the final stunt was weak but Goldeneye was made on a relatively tiny $58 million budget and was the last Bond film produced for under $100 million. One funny thing in the film is the inclusion of Joe Don Baker as CIA agent Jack Wade. I know that the Bond films like to reuse actors (see Maude Adams, Charles Gray, Shane Rimmer) but Baker had been the MAIN VILLAIN just two films prior. The movie also includes a pre-X-Men Famke Janssen and Alan Cumming, a pre-Harry Potter Robbie Coltrane and a pre-everything Minnie Driver who you'll miss if you blink and of course Sean Bean went on to appear in Lord of the Rings AND Game of Thrones.<br /><br />I recently watch Die Another Day and it is shocking how bad it is. The dialogue is just atrocious but Goldeneye generally keeps its composure. There are some groaners for sure but most of the time Bond speaks like an actual human being not a pun spewing goofball. I am not a fan of the Brosnan era but not because of Brosnan, it's the writers and directors that are to blame. Goldeneye could have ushered in a tremendous decade; instead it was the one lone gem in the batch.azing tank vs train collision. The cradle is one of the best villain lairs although it always amused me that Trevelyan feels the need to build this gigantic dish. A giant dish is used to receive signals not send signals. Are we to assume that the Goldeneye satellite will detonate BETTER if controlled by an enormous dish? I loved the entire opening sequence from the bungee jump to the leap into a falling plane. Ok, the green screening on the final stunt was weak but Goldeneye was made on a relatively tiny $58 million budget and was the last Bond film produced for under $100 million.

B009KS4XRO|5.0|It works really well on my Kindle fire.  Almost as good as playing on Facebook.  Not bad for a free app.
0399157565|5.0|It is an excellent read, don't get me wrong, not as exciting as RED MIST but good.  My usual complaint: a long, slow buildup and then 7/8 of the way through the book a rushed ending, tying up strings too quickly for enjoyment.  I never figured what Marino did to get in so much trouble....she left us expecting something more than just a social networking.<br /><br />I agree it is a good first book for new readers as it goes back to Kay' beginnings as the prior books do not...but I agree her first 6 books were her masterpieces...and POST MORTEM the first and very best.<br />I have all 20 books and won't part with one.....TRACE was a big disappointment. but if you read my other reviews you will see why.<br /><br />She is still one of my three favorite authors. The lady is smart and her research is flawless.
B009CPJHY4|3.0|Worth a look. Boomers will like it. Youngsters will yawn. The location of India is quite nice. Maggie Smith is wasted here, though, but she does a stellar job as always.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|A little on the fantastic side, but i liked it.  A lot of politically correct stuff that i resented.  I learned one word.
B009EAO38C|5.0|I don't have much to say... This CD is simply awesome!!!!! I can't stop listening to it! I'm glad I bought it! Check their channel on youtube... I'm sure you'll order the CD after that!
B0044XRIMW|5.0|What a great film for all ages!  I had not watched it since I was a child and I think it is even better now!  My husband is not a fan of musicals but even he was singing the goat herder song for days.  Prepare to have a sing-a-long after!
0714834491|5.0|you will see thing a different way, really give things that boggle the mind, like &#34; civilizations is chaos resting&#34;...
B006BAEQB2|5.0|I have read all so far of Philippas books in this series and am awaiting the last. She really brings to life the rise of the Yorkists and takes you step by step into each part. I just loved reading all about it and was able to understand it. Some books about the history so far back is very hard to understand but is was wonderful to read and understand.
1475143389|5.0|Girlfriend ordered me this book for my birthday! Sat down and read it in one sitting while taking notes to remember all the key points. I have been already working out steady for 1 year but this book really helped me get everything 100% on par with what I needed to be doing.<br />Been doing Mike's work out routine in the book for 5 weeks now and really have my eating schedule down. Already seeing great results! Mike even took the time to personally respond to a few questions I had via email. Also, have the<br />cook book he did. Tasty recipes, also recommended! Thanks again Mike! -Chris
0811826848|5.0|Gives you way more information than the TV series.  Especially from John Lennon, whose every written word appears in this (it seems).  Unlikely to be surpassed.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|This is the Rush we have all been waiting for. Snakes and Arrows was a great album that showed a glimpse into the future, and here it is. Clockwork Angels is an excellent album that is meant to be listened to as an Album. Sure there are technically a few 'Singles' from it, but any true Rush fan knows the album as a whole is the best way to listen. You will not be disappointed by this album.
B001N09BDS|3.0|The movie was pretty good I only bought the movie because it was for an assignment so I didn't really get to enjoy it. Overall the movie was pretty good I don't have any complaints to make.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|Another great one by Kelly Clarkson.  Packaged securely so there was no risk of it being damaged in transportation. I would recommend this CD to any Kelly Clarkson fan.
B007HACDLK|4.0|The story takes us through typical Rapp plots but diverges slightly when Rapp has memory loss and glimpses of tolerance and empathy appear.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Love the game, but sometimes it won't let you place something where you want it. I am glad I bought this game.
B009LK6JS2|1.0|TOO COMPLICATED... VERY HARD TO CONTROL ... NEED TO HAVE AN EASY, MEDIUM AND HARD OPTION.. DONT LIKE IT AT ALL..
B008AK8FHM|3.0|While I loved the overall messages contained within &#34;Proof of Heaven,&#34; I found the author's voice to be rather dry and monotone throughout the book which made his bright light experience seem dim and dull to this reader.  I appreciated Alexander's candor in retelling his near death experience; however, I felt that his underdeveloped storytelling skills stopped this from reaching its full potential.  Overall, an below average to average book with an extraordinary experience attached.
B003I55BIA|4.0|Who doesn't like a Good Girl/Bad Boy love story? :) Although it isn't a masterpiece as far as writing is concerned, I enjoyed reading it and couldn't put it down until I was finished.
B000PC0SPU|4.0|Pink's description made my right brain light up in excitement for the future possibilities on this planet!  It left me very curious to hear how left brainers have reviewed this book.  Is there resistance or a shared committment to this shift?
B009LA1QW6|4.0|I would give this 4 our of 5 with a plus or minus of 0.5 depending on personal preferences.  If you love Lana Del Rey, these songs follow the same themes as Born to Die and are generally rather good.  On the other hand, it feels more like additional releases from the prior album and does not have a single, really powerful song - it's more of a continuation rather than an evolution.  With only 8 tracks, buy it on sale or a discounted rate, but these are good additions to the Lana Del Rey music book.  The album definitely grows on you over time.
B004QX07G4|4.0|Seriously. Funny.<br /><br />In this modern age where there are millions of highly stressed peeps bumping into each other in the grocery store, this book is a good reminder to step away from to cart to laugh a little.  Or a lot.  Yeah, get this book and laugh.  A lot!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I'VE DEBATED AND DECIDED NOT TO BUY THIS FAKE LUCAS NOW DISNEY GARBAGE SMUTT.  IT WAS IN MY CART FIVE TIMES BUT I DELETED IT DUE TO THE BAD VERSION
B008602KQI|5.0|Good, intense, movie. Loved the movie, wish they made more like them! Would recommend to watch. Excellent  buy! Love the fact of being able to download and watch.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|It's wicked and scary, right up my alley.  Awesome season.  I didn't watch first season but it has nothing to do with last season so it's good thing!
B001O5LVPI|3.0|We  love LILO & Stitch, it's very nice to watch with whole family together!<br />we like it!!<br />We can teach to child,  you are so lucky how you are live in your life now!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I liked this book. Good, quick read.  Definitely has a silver lining!  Could have been a little longer but still a good read.
0156027321|5.0|I loved \\"Life of Pi.\\" It is one of the best books I have read in a long time. I picked it up at Costco, hoping to be entertained for a few days. Instead I found a beautifully written, touching, thought-provoking, exciting, and funny adventure. I highly recommend it!
B00A77II0U|5.0|I love this game. Found it very entertaining and well worth the money!!  Look forward to more games by Alawar !
B0031RAOVY|5.0|If you love dogs and especially Akita's, you will love this movie!  It is based on a true story and is such a moving tale of a dog's loyalty.  Kleenex alert on this one!!  Probably the best dog movie I have ever seen...
0671027344|5.0|One of my favorite books. Charlie is definitely relatable and thought provoking. A must read for teenagers who may be wallflowers themselves.
B009RI4ZKC|3.0|I would not recommend this for children. We enjoyed it overall, but would not recommend to anyone other than for them to watch on a whim.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The desire to continue the &#34;Games&#34; experience was intense. Each character, even villainous, evoked strong & mixed emotions - adding to the genuineness of the experience! Collins builds & maintains a pulse in her craft that is undeniable. Recommend ???? I dare any to sample & not get hooked, even after viewing the film !!!!  jjc
B008JGSM6G|4.0|First levels are too easy but easy to get hooked with the higher levels. Really easy to link all the circles.  Sometimes the challenge is filling the screen with pipe.
B005C9YZPA|5.0|This made a Great gift for my son the social studies teacher he loves the Discovery channel and now he can watch whenever he wants too, I plan to get him the Ice age ones that the discovery channel is offering next.
B003Y5H53S|5.0|My husband and I both think this is one of the best films released. It is great for young and all and can watched over and  over again. My husband(aged62) has shown this film to his brother and to one of his buddies. He recommends it to everyone.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Held my attention throughout the movie.....great acting.....true picture of India. The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel was highlt recommended and deserving of the praise.
0446580848|3.0|It is typical JohnCorry, but after 300 pages of wise cracks i was asking myself, when will something happon? It is a good read but lacks the punch of Wildfire, Plum Island or the Lion.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I glanced at the movie during a recent flight and was interested enough to order the first book.  Since it is labelled by our library as a book for young persons, i.e. teenagers, I was rather dubious about whether I would like it.  In the event I very much enjoyed it.  The characterization was good and the plot and rapid-fire action kept me coming back to it.  So I finished it quickly and am looking forward to the second volume.
B0090P98Z4|3.0|I like this game. Its fun, easy for my kids to play, my children love playing EW 2 a lot it just that we think u should be able to upgrade your weapons, potolions, and ur skill with the points u get there's to much stuff to get with glu points. I feel that u should be able to use either your glu points or the coins u earn while playing the game. U should be able to have more available to purchase with the coins/points or by the coins
B001H1SVO8|5.0|I am a huge Chuck Palahniuk fan.  I bought this for the extra content (because I own the first blu-ray release) and it was definitely worth the money.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|A good book that makes you stop and think about how important time is and what you will do with the time given to you.
B00A12VW86|3.0|I liked Uno way more. Maybe I have to give it another listen but let's hope the Tre album is a little better :)
B0060MYM3S|4.0|Good show for adults who enjoy fantasy.<br /><br />There should be no minimium word requirements for ratings.  Please change this requirement.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This show is a modern Alfred Hitchcock, Twilight Zone, or Outer Limits. Deliciously creepy. The music selections add a great deal to the plot.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Very mind blowing, I am not a big reader and it usually takes me close to a month to read a book. This book was done in one week
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I play all kinds of games (AION, Black Ops II, Guild Wars, Boarderlands 2 etc...) I have saved profiles for each one and there is no problems switching between each one.<br /><br />I also have the G510 (keyboard) G930 (headphones) and G400 (mouse) and the profiles saved can be used on all of these products (not sure about the headphones because nothing changes on them between the games).<br /><br />One thing to note, after getting pissed off in Black Ops II I repedidly slammed my hands down on the G13 in a fit of rage... It messed something up with the settings so all I had to do was reboot the computer and then it worked great. (Also provided me with some time to cool down).<br /><br />So even abused this thing still works great!! LOL!!!!
B0041KVW2K|5.0|Okay, maybe I'm exaggerating a little here-it ain't the<br />Commies. But my 2012 Beatles Box Set is so PERFECT, and<br />sounds so INCREDIBLE, that I find it hard to believe that<br />so many people received defective vinyl.<br /> Here's my thought: all these people who are complaining<br />about 'bad pressings' are doing so to get the rest of us<br />to OPEN EACH AND EVERY ALBUM IN THE SET to give them<br />a test listen to make sure they're okay. Meanwhile,<br />the 'complainers' are actually STASHING AWAY SEALED ALBUMS<br />that they haven't even listened to in the hopes that someday<br />the Box Set will be worth ONE MILLION DOLLARS.<br /> In any case, it is sad that this particular boxed set<br />will be remembered as the 'defective' one. I'm just<br />happy that mine doesn't fall into that category.<br /> My favorite album so far: 'Revolver'- I was too young<br />to really appreciate this landmark album, and I honestly<br />think my older siblings were confused when they heard<br />some of the tracks on it (Within You, Without You;<br />Tomorrow Never Knows) at friends' houses. (\\"That's<br />the Beatles? What are they trying to do?\\")Consequently,<br />'Revolver' never became part of our Beatles library<br />in the 60's. So I'm really glad to 'rediscover' this<br />classic for the first time.<br /> In closing I'd like to say that I truly sympathize<br />with those of you who received defective vinyl- you<br />really don't know what you're missing!
B009SCRERI|5.0|I'm not really into ferries... but my kid loves this movie (we've seen it 10 times already) Good Movie the first time, I'm just jaded now.
1416550534|5.0|This book was SO well written. I am new to this author and cannot wait to read more!  The way it switches from the reminiscences of Grace in her 90s to the young Grace living out the events leading to the revelation of a past secret, is just so good!
B00915G6MG|5.0|waiting on pins & needles for season 10 to be released ... this program is the best we've ever seen on tv.<br />since we live in a very rural / mountain area we do not get either satellite nor cable.<br />we love the characters & with each season they go more in-depth with them.<br />ps...from the first two seasons - has any one figured out who the red head in the convertible who picks up gibbs is???  has anyone figured out how gibbs gets the boat out of the basement????<br />great show - highly recommended :)
1451695195|4.0|I have let a friend borrow & she loved it,  thanks Dr Alexander for sharing your wonderful story.  True Blessing.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|These games are incredibly engaging and memorable. I loved the updates and the reference to Himidaisy with FSTEAK but seriously, if you want an engaging vita game this is the game for you! <3 it's a dating sim too so you'll have tons of fun!
B000TEUSJK|5.0|A truly world class piece of work.  Good writing that stayed within believable bounds.  Excellent actors and deliciously wonderful sex scenes-loved the orgy.
B009GEBBNQ|3.0|Granted, Marvel is all about the guys.  I miss you Wonder Woman.  You were, for us girls, the only heroine. You were beautiful, brave, and there to protect us from the evil ones of the world.  Today's &#34;heroes&#34; blow up stuff and kill people.  Superman, Batman, The Green Hornet turned the bad people over to the police for justice to triumph.
0547884591|5.0|Found Mr. Ferriss' works after finally getting around to watching his SALT talk for the Longnow foundation about \\"The Meta Skill of Acquiring Skills.\\" I was sufficiently intrigued to pick up all three of his books in Kindle form, and I've been tearing through them at a quick rate.  \\"Four Hour Body\\" has so far inspired the most immediate action, but I found the \\"Meta\\" section of this book to be the most broadly interesting and useful. When it comes to the actual cooking part, though I'm pretty comfortable in the kitchen, I'm finding the philosophy behind the book (especially the minimalism with tools) to be both inspirational and entertaining. I'm giving the Slow-Carb diet a try, and this book ought to help keep it interesting.
B001NTCSCK|5.0|one if my favorites!!!! this brings me back to my teens. i can just loss myself listening to them. love it.
B005E94WB0|5.0|Just exactly what I needed for my Bluetooth. It is a stylish leather case that is durable. VERY PLEASED WITH IT!!
B004SBX112|5.0|You think these are cute, innocent little birds. But, Beware! They will suck you in, and before you know it, your ADDICTED!!!! There is no intervention available with this app. So give up and give in to the Seasons and enjoy,enjoy and enjoy!!!!!!
B00005AR3G|5.0|This movie is hilarious. Not just for kids! Good voice actors make it very entertaining. I always smile when watching this movie!
B008673ZAQ|3.0|Well after reading Fifty Shades of Grey I couldn't help but be pulled to this series. The first book was really pretty good, and so I waited to buy this until it came out. I have to say though that I was a tad disappointed. Eva seemed to me, to be really annoying in this book, with the same constant phrases over and over, believe me I was pretty done with hearing over and over how Gideon was so handsome, and great, and blah..  And then there's Gideon.. can't live without Eva, she's his reason.. okay I got it, let' delve a little deeper, and keep the story going.  I was really looking forward to this book, so maybe my anticipation led to just a little bit too much hype in my head. I don't know. I may pick up the next book in the series just to see if Gideon and Eva's story continues on a better note. Sylvia Day is a great author, and I'd be happy to give the next book a shot if it looks to hold some promise. With all the positive reviews on this books I'd think it would be better than how I felt it turned out.
0316056871|5.0|This book was amazing. I laughed out loud many times while reading. I even had to read some passages to my boyfriend so he could laugh too. Tina has some great advice!
B008G12EUY|5.0|New Muse's album is one of the best of the Best! Not only in Muse history, but in last 10 years of industry!
B008BM0IUG|3.0|I just listened to a review of this book and it sound great.  However, the only critical review to show up on this site was a rant by someone who has also not yet read the book but was upset that the author does not give creationist enough credit.  I am hoping this will serve as a more pleasant place holder for the \\"most helpful critical review\\" until such time as a reasonable critical review shows up (if one does).<br /><br />Looking forward to reading the actual book!
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|My wife, her friend, and I watch this movie last night. We are all three adults, and we thoroughly enjoyed this movie. There are parts that we all laughed and made us smile.  I would definitely recommend everyone watching this movie, no matter what age you are. You will enjoy it.
B008Y5OWMK|5.0|I dig all sorts of movies: short films (bought &#34;The LostThing&#34; BEFORE it won an Oscar), action flicks (from the latest James Bond and &#34;Mission Impossible&#34; movies and &#34;Ronin&#34;, right on back to &#34;Bullet&#34;,), dramas (&#34;Kramer vs. Kramer&#34;, &#34;Schindler's List&#34;) and foreign flicks (&#34;Betty Blue&#34;, &#34;A Very Long Engagement&#34;, etc).  And western's make the cut, of course: from &#34;Forgiven&#34; on back to &#34;The magnificent Seven&#34;, &#34;Winchester 73&#34; and &#34;The Searchers&#34;.<br /><br />But no matter what, I usually have a soft spot for epic movies: blame it on Cecil B. Demille. &#34;Docotor Zhivago&#34;, &#34;The Ten Commandments&#34;, &#34;Red&#34; -- loved 'em all.<br /><br />And I enjoyed the hell out of &#34;Heaven's Gate&#34; when I finally had the chance to see it on VHS, back in the 80s.  Kept my copy and re-watched it; bought a DVD when it was issued.  And now that they've produced a longer, uncut version, bought that, too.<br /><br />The writing isn't perfect: as someone else already noted, a bit more background on _exactly_ why all the characters (met in the beginning, in that wonderful opening scene set in and outside Harvard University) go west.  And the story is _based_ on the Johnson County wars: it's not a detailed recreation of it.  The writer and Director, Cimino, borrows names and events from that seminal event to cobble up some reasonable verisimilitude -- families of immigrants, freshly moved to the western state of Wyoming, hoping for a land of plenty and encountering hardships, racism, bigotry and starvation -- as he spins a tale of class wars: rich cattle barons stomping all over poor immigrants and their families.  Everyone _isn't_ depicted as either purely evil or purely good.  There are reasons for the anger of the Cattle Barons.  And there are reasons for the desperate acts of the immigrants.  But the outcome of it all -- the Johnson County war, the murders, etc. -- and the enduring class wars in this country cannot be denied.<br /><br />Neither can the visual beauty of this film.  Film is a visual medium, something too many people -- especially those in the twitter and MTV generations -- often forget.  The director and the film  should show the audience things it hasn't seen before.  &#34;Heaven's Gate&#34; does just that, and more.  And Giulia D'Agnolo Vallan's essay, in the accompanying booklet, along with some interviews (Kristofferson, etc.) illuminate why this movie blazed a trail for things like &#34;Wild Bill&#34; and even &#34;Deadwood&#34;.<br /><br />&#34;Heaven's Gate&#34; is definitely an Epic Western: and definitely the sort of film enjoyed only by those who are a bit more thoughtful, and a bit more patient than your average, 21st Century, American moviegoer.during class wars in this country cannot be denied.<br /><br />Neither can the visual beauty of this film.

B0091LS07E|2.0|Ok, this is not an impressive album for me. I have every single one of her albums (including this one now :-(), and I have always purchased her entire works because I have never been disappointed Until now. First of all, I was very excited about \\"Girl on Fire\\", then I get the record and all I get is a remix version...REALLY?!? Then artists wonder why torrent is still used???? I wish there was a money back guarantee, because really this album is sub-par at best.<br />At the first run through, the only songs that stood out were \\"Girl on Fire\\" once I got past Nicki's annoying voice and her duet with Maxwell, other than those two songs everything else is bland.<br /><br />I was expecting to get \\"Girl on Fire\\", but instead I got Nicki Minaj, so Sad, So Sad...This was supposed to be Alicia's SONG!! Why, Why, Why!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Could not put the book down.  My heart broke for this child/woman.  So much was stolen from her life, helping me to appreciate my family and my own life.  So glad Jaycee is making it over the hurdles she has encountered.  My prayers for peace go out to her and her two daughters.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|love it, the dynamics of the chracter always keep you on your toes.<br />I read all the scarpetta series' So does my daughter
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Well this morning my ears popped. now I will rock out to the sound of 2 dogs barking at each other.
0064430170|5.0|Great book going to a 2nd Generation parent for their little one! This book was a favorite when our sons were little, now that one of them are parents, it was a gift to them when their first child was born. It brougth tears to his eyes and read it to his new born son in the hospital, while his wife had the video camera. What a great tradition!!!
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|I loved the book.  The movie still showed strength of character no matter where you fit on the financial chart and inspires one to correct injustices.  I hope the day will come when we drop adjectives such as caucasian, black, brown, skinny and fat.  I would like to see us all be people
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|If you love 80's pop/ nerd culture, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, this is a fun and nostalgic read.
B0018D4SHY|5.0|Little Richard was the greatest,, even today he performs like the old days.<br />Some the best dance music for the era
1452101248|2.0|I selected this book based on all the overwhelmingly good reviews. I want to eat more vegetables and desire to expand my knowledge. When the book arrived, I was excited and immediately sat down to read it and make my shopping list. But, as I looked through it, I realized a few things that make this not a good book for me:  it is more gourmet than I am - not a problem for many I'm sure, but most of the recipes take longer than I have as a working Mom.  And, too many ingredients are needed and many of them I have never heard of.  I don't know how to say it, but it's for \\"foodies\\" which I am not. Many people will love this book, I was just looking for some quick new ideas where I could expand the types of vegetables we eat. Good book for many, but not for me.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I think the game is good because there isn't any really steep falls or nothing. but they could use a couple of things but the updates make better so how about next time they make it possible to find diamonds
B005NFW0U0|5.0|If you liked Twilight this is very similar, they have gone a little overboard at times like True Blood has.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I have finished all the puzzles. and have won all the levels of prizes that it is allowing me to get. I have 6105 coins in my bank and so what NOW - Where do I go now. Is there a place to learn some of the things mean - like what are the XP coins and do add up somewhere for something?
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I had been wanting to read this book for a while and I'm glad I finally did. It is a real page-turner and I was hooked from the start. I'd recommend it to anyone.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Perhaps this book is for a younger person, as I am in my sixties.  The story line seemed &#34;sick&#34; to me.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|A true family movie! So good to see the old world myths portrayed in such a whimsical way.<br />This is a keeper.
0399226907|4.0|I purchased the board style because my two year old doesn't do well with paper pages. The book is built well, the story rocks of course, it's a classic. Was hoping for a little bit bigger, though.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|Love Phillip.  Wishing him a long and successful career!  I can't wait for his next set to come out.  He is growing into one of my favorites.
B003I55BIA|4.0|This book sucks you in from the start! Great read enjoyable from the start to the end! You will not be disappointed
B009FXIICK|2.0|no instructions on purpose. sure it is easy to figure it is similar to bejewelled, so you start looking for 3+ of an animal, but the target between levels is unclear. are you looking for a particular animal or any animal too not run out of time? do you need some of each? a countdown clock would be nice. controls ok. music cute. installed played deleted. faotd.
B001HN694K|5.0|Totally love this version of Alice in Wonderland. I'm a Johnny Depp fan anyway so that helps, but this movie is simply delightful.
B00A7ZWUJC|1.0|The only good song is Diamonds....I suggest that you save the money and just download the one song. Not worth buying the whole thing.
B001EC3JME|4.0|I recently bought a $10 LED Totes flashlight for my duty belt at work (as opposed to the huge Maglite I was using) and of course trying to find a holster that could fit it was going to be another mission, or so I thought. I read the reviews and saw how others in law enforcement purchased this for work and had no problem fitting their flashlight in it. I received mine today and was pleasantly surprised to find that not only did it fit, it fit perfectly! The look and feel rivals that of my fellow officers who paid well over a $100 for their flashlight/holster combo from Galls. One of the under promoted features of this holster is the fact that is that not only will the clip fit on your duty belt it also has a swivel so when you go to sit in your car you can rotate it so it does not jam in your side. A truly awesome deal for less than $10!!
B003Y74AZ2|2.0|But the problem is that the silicone attracts small dirt and it sticks to the cover so over time you need to keep it clean...
B009GEEMLY|2.0|HD quality was lacking. Movie was good but 4.99 for poor HD quality is disappointing. I thought it was my internet but HD on netflix worked fine.
B00A0NOF7G|4.0|This book moved very quickly. Good plot, interesting twists with different  characters. I give it a four because I thought more could have been done with the grandmother and her group
B005LAII0I|5.0|This was a gift for my daughters, 8 & 6.  They have watched it so many times they have memorized the movie I think :)
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Adequately primed by the single superhero movies from the Marvel stable, I was waiting eagerly for the Avengers. It didn't disappoint. Whedon's screenplay and direction need no introduction. They were simply superb. It was nice to see the familiar faces together - because of the backstories, casting is very important. It couldn't have been easy to get everyone together, but the movie team did a great job. Now eagerly waiting for the next ones!!
B0028R3NCU|5.0|This thing is pretty sweet...<br /><br />First, all metal construction. WIN.<br />Second, NO STUPID FLASHING LIGHT. ULTRA WIN.<br />Third, it accepts microSD cards, as it is advertised as a \\"card reader\\"<br /><br />To give you an idea of what I am using this for... I have a car radio with an USB port on the front. The radio will read just about anything and I used to have my WD500gb hard drive attached. Until I noticed it was beginning to fail due to the lack of secured mounting and road vibrations. I really wanted to replace it with a high capacity flash drive.... Until I saw this thing.<br /><br />Its perfect. I can drop a 32gb microSD card into it, put all my music on it and then put it in my radio. The thing is tiny. Maybe 1.75 times the length of a microSD card with the same width. Later on in life, I can upgrade to larger size microSD cards as they become available.<br /><br />Did i mention that it has no stupid bright flashing light? this is great for driving my car at night. All interior colors match and I don't have to watch a light blink as I listen to music.<br /><br />I wouldn't say its the best card reader out there. I would find this functionality annoying. The microSD card fits tight. The card reader is small. However I do feel like it will be durable, as it is all metal construction.<br /><br />For me, it works perfect as a trusty, upgradeable and low profile jump drive.
B000Q6ZG5M|5.0|This is my favorite of the Potter series of books/movies.  Awesome in blu-ray. My dog ate my copy and I am happy I could find a replacement
B007HACDLK|5.0|This book is a typical Vince Flynn page turner. I find it extremely difficult to put the book down after I have started reading.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Cool story and awesome animation...even for adults!!! I would recommend it for sure!!! And now I am getting tired of trying to think of a few more words!!!
B009X00E18|4.0|This case does what it intends to do.  It protects the screen when closed, it will provide some level of protection from banging around but it is not a heavy-duty cover.  The best part is it is very light and compact and your fire hardly seems any bulkier with it than without it.  I really like that.<br /><br />The fold back for standing works well but only has one position.  The micro-fiber lining is good and necessary since the cover touches the screen.  Overall this is a pretty good case.  I think it is overpriced but it does a good job if you are willing to pay for it.
B0043WDK2G|5.0|Great show! We are captured audience. Castle ha great observations and Beckett has the gun. Combined they are a force to be reckoned with.
B008602KQI|5.0|Have not viewed, but the recipient loves it.  Not sure of the content, but met the approval for a fourteen and fifteen year old's parents. The books were available through Scholastic books.
B000YHG72E|5.0|One of the movies we watch as a whole family during the Holidays!  You should add it to your list.

B001UHOWXI|5.0|If you have never seen this movie you are missing out on one of the best movies ever made.  It is awesome.
B008G12EUY|4.0|This album is a step back from the previous album. This will not have as many hits as the last one, but there are some new sounds. The album felt rushed in the writing stage with some so-so tunes but it is very strong in the finish with a very full sound and a new lead voice in a couple songs. Its still a Muse album and a good one, but overall i would put this as their 3rd best album.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|My kids watch this movie weekly during the Holiday Season.  It is awesome and you need to see it if you haven't
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Of all his books I think I liked this one among the top. Can't wait until his next one comes out.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I could not put this book down.  It is a fantastic read.  One of my top ten favourite books of all time.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I love Alawar games and this one certainly lived up to my expectations.  So much fun and creepy story line!

B008D28HYS|5.0|I love this app, as well as its monochrome companion.  Lots of entertainment provided, to be sure.  I use it on my phone, but I bet it's even better on a tablet.
B000MV9026|5.0|Bought this as a birthday gift for a friend and she loved it.  Great movie. I would definitely recommend watching.
0470474874|2.0|This book is more geared for someone who has been working with excel for awhile.  Would not recommend for novices.

B00A8ECU24|5.0|If you are a briny I reccomend this app! Its like they.combined Cityville with My Little Pony and added fun minigames!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Hooked from page one! Recommended to both sister and sister in law! They also lived it and recommended it! Very sexy book!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Started reading this while waiting for Brandon Sanderson to finish his next book, guess now i'm waiting for the Anthony's next book too...<br />Really well written, great story with many turns - loved it!
B0009P5YXO|2.0|I ordered this for my boyfriend last year for Christmas, and was a bit disappointed with the result. The screwdriver is NOT realistic; it's plastic and very dull. The sound worked and was pretty fun, until it broke after about a month from use. Basically if you are expecting an exact sonic screwdriver replica, then don't go for this. It's really fun to play with though! Probably best for a child.
B0087GF8ZG|4.0|Works well.<br /><br />Wish I could adjust how long the delay before it goes out.<br /><br />I would recommend it to anybody.
B004I744AS|5.0|love this app. great word of the day and articles. also great quotes and the horoscopes are quite reliable. I highly recommend it
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|I was just saying how there's so many movies about son/father (finding nemo, bambi), or father and daughter (the little mermaid, ice age continental drift), but none about mother/daughter relationships. Now there is one. Very cute movie.
0131103628|5.0|This is not just one of the best books on C, or the best books on programming, but one of the best pieces of technical writing I've read.  The authors' clarity shines off the page.  The style is approachable but never wastes a word.  There is one flaw: some code examples favor cleverness over clarity.  The authors use post-increment ++, assignment in conditionals, and short circuiting boolean operators in ways that are not easy to understand at first glance.  These tricks can save a few lines of code but they take longer to understand and verify as correct.  I do not think that C developers should emulate the code style in this book.  I still recommend it wholeheartedly, but take the code examples with a grain of salt.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Long live Adam Brown anybody like him!!! A very inspiring book for any man to give his sons and daughters!
B0055S348W|2.0|I purchased his to get my Kindle to print and it will not work ot sure if I can put my Android on it or not.  Advertisement made it sound like it would work but after trying different things and reading on other peoples blogs they could not get it to work either.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|When an author can take an improbably story and make a skeptical reader suspend his disbelief, he's accomplished something. When the author then takes that very fact and uses it for his own purposes at the end of the story, he's done something really special.<br /><br />This is a special book. It is an always-entertaining story of a young Indian boy set adrift on a lifeboat in the Pacific with a Bengal Tiger (why not?). Beyond being a survival story, it is a story of maintaining hope, and in the end, a story about how you, the reader, view the world.<br /><br />Not to be missed.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|I have every version of this film but all of them put together could not match of audio-video brilliance of this BD release.  I have a 55&#34; Panasonic plasma and a rather expensive sound system but I was not expecting what this movie delivers in the BD format.  The colors and resolution are breathtaking.  There is a desert scene where Lean filmed from a great distance behind a rocky outcrop and it almost looks 3 dimensional.  Simply phenomenal.  The dialog is razor sharp and the Maurice Jarre score is magnificent.  Fortunatey David Lean's films are making it to BD and we are all the luckier for it.  My favorite Lean film is one that was critics hated - Ryan's Daughter.  Can't wait to see that on blu-ray but there is no release date yet.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|FIFTY SHADES OF INSIPID: Yes, folks, I read the entire god-awful trilogy. I was able to do this because, after a certain level of exposure, the trite writing style and paper-thin character development no longer consumed my entire attention. And while the tediously repetitious sex scenes never ceased to grate on my nerves much like the incessantly repeated verbs, I learned that it is possible to skip them entirely as they add nothing whatever to the story. This leaves us with the story. There is one, but it is so ludicrously unbelievable as to inspire nothing but distain for the two-dimensional protagonist and an oddly satisfying anti-lust for her one-dimensional lover/husband/foil.<br />We are to believe that a gawky, poorly-educated, simpering idiot virgin of a girl somehow incites the passions of a megalomaniacal billionaire business mogul. Lest you think this is a sweet Cinderella story, think again. Our billionaire also happens to be a sexual sadist who likes to beat little brown-haired girls half to death in his expensively appointed penthouse dungeon. But, hey, he's rich! And he beats girls with really nice canes and expensive leather whips, so it's not like ordinary trailer-trash domestic violence, right?<br />We are also to believe that our young, virginal, and clearly not very bright young lady falls head over heels in love with this sicko, moves in with him a couple of weeks after meeting him, marries him shortly after that, and is thrilled to be expecting his child in a few short months. (Spare yourself the sex scenes in the third book, which include our very pregnant heroine being flogged across the belly by her oh-so-loving sadist husband. I am not kidding. E.L. James knows no boundaries whatsoever.)<br />If you have a taste for perverse literature, there are much better writers available to scratch that peculiar little itch. If you are reading this crap just because everyone else is reading it, be my guest. This story is too insipid to traumatize anyone. Clamber on into it; maybe it will make you blush, flush, and bite your lip! Most likely, though, you'll just roll your eyes at the sheer tedium of the author's inadequacies.
1451620829|4.0|I read this after reading the one about Kiss, Ace Frehley and also Sammy Hagar's stuff about Van Halen. The pattern becomes obvious: young guns achieve explosive success in their early twenties before they've had the chance to live life on their own, and whoosh! the only life they know is on the road in a business full of dysfunctional people, money, drugs, sex and power. Band members almost always become self-centered and think the world revolves around them. And even if you can resist that, you'll eventually cave in to it when your closest bandmates go through it. Anyway, this was an interesting book from Peter's point of view. There aren't many stars who have a happy ending, and I imagine that's because it's a fake and temporal lifestyle; it's not normal for people to deal with that level of adoration. I'm just glad I never became a rock star!
B007HACDLK|5.0|This is something small, but a few chapters into the book a certain character is at a hospital, a Command Master Sergeant in the USAF. This wouldn't be a problem if this rank actually existed. I know I'm probably being a nit picker but as a member of the USAF this really drove me crazy. Now there is a Command Chief Master Sergeant, but they would never be called a Command Master Sergeant. It just seems to me that with all of the research Vince supposedly puts into his books, this should have been an easy mistake to fix. Ask any Air Force member and this could have been corrected. Honest mistake, but man did it drive me crazy. Other than that so far the book has been ok....
B00009ZYC0|4.0|A good movie but not one of my favoriet cruise films.  A good flick non the less and good for your personal collection.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The first half of this novel tended to be slow-unlike previous Grisham writings. The plot was little convoluted, hard to follow. However, once I reached the second half, I couldn't stop reading. I didn't want the story to stop! Overall, a great read-just persevere past the beginning.
B00004RFFS|4.0|Good 90's movie with Cruise and Pitt.  A great Vampire story before the Twilight crazy of the late 2000's.  Definitely a good buy.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I was sorry that it came to an end.  I expect the author will continue with the story considering how well received it has been.  Well written, well paced, good characters.  I'm looking forward to reading the prequel and hope to see more of this story in the future.  Good stuff!
B00003CXDG|5.0|Another great M.I. movie.  I actually like this one better than the first movie.  A good buy for an action/ Cruise fan
B007D2XSW0|1.0|it put a virus in my phone, and I had to wipe my phone clean and reload everything I had in it, BIG waste of time and money...
B0000YEEGM|5.0|Classic Hoffman and Cruise.  This movie brings out the best in both actors.  It is a must have for any lover of film
B004ADH1RI|5.0|This is a classic and I just love watching it after a bad day or something. It's corney and silly and totally unbelievable and I love it.
6305181772|5.0|The original in the Cruise M.I. series and it does not dissapoint.  Good casting and action sequences throughout.  A good buy for your collection.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|So, I have never played any of the Persona series. However, this one grabbed my attention so I picked it up. This is the first RPG that I have played on the Vita that I truly enjoyed. I Love the Anime cut scenes, the story, and the fighting.  As I said, this is what the Vita needed. I am only a few hours into it, but am thoroughly enjoying it.<br /><br />Update: So I am still playing the game, haven't beaten it yet, however, I have been doing the quests, building social links, and just enjoying the game. This game, has you like the c=haracters, fall in love with them because of how deep and emotional the game can be. This is by far one of the Top 10 games. After playing this, I went and purchased the rest of the persona series so I can start from the beginning.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|Another great action film in the Mission Impossible series.  A must have for an action movie or cruise fan. good buy
B00005ASOC|4.0|teens like the movie I did as well . I was glad they had it . It was a hard one to locate at first
B005C9YZIM|4.0|This was a Christmas gift for my stepfather.  He watches History Chanel, How It's Made, Discovery T.V. type things so I thought this would fit the bill.  I'm told he really enjoyed this so it's a good gift idea for those hard to buy for people.
B004EPZ07K|5.0|What a great price. It was a black friday deal and was offered at a great value. I may not have purchased it otherwise, but the offer was too good to turn down.
0307477479|5.0|This has become one of my favorite books. I've read it multiple times since I've received it. The book itself came in very good condition!
1401929281|2.0|I've been applying the techniques outlined in this book, so far to little or no avail. I was initially very excited by the extraordinary healings and rejuvenations the author describes. It seemed that Theta Healing had the potential to connect us directly to the Divine, a realm of unlimited potential. Enlightenment, extreme longevity, and mastery of the Law of Attraction all seemed to be within reach. So I've been sincerely practicing the Theta Healing method these last weeks with very disappointing results. I did manage to see some flashes in my third eye area, which rarely happens, but that's about all I have to report so far. This is a very visually based method. The author, who admits to being extremely clairvoyant her entire life, might not fully appreciate the fact that most of us don't have the ability to see high definition visions at will through our third eyes, which prevents us from being able to properly carry out her instructions. If you are clairvoyant, Theta Healing might work wonders for you. Then again it may not. I did extensive research on the internet trying very hard to find the kind of inspiring testimonials that the author describes from her own practice. The only testimonials I found were in the realm of pain management and psychological healing - aka events that can be chalked up to the placebo effect. I found no cases of healed broken bones, spontaneous remissions of cancer, bald spots filling in, wrinkles disappearing, or reversals of the aging process - aka physical healings that can be scientifically quantified. I do have a friend who has reported miraculous results from entering into the Theta brainwave state via listening to isochronic theta beats while reading a list of affirmations. There is evidence to indicate that affirmations and the Laws of Attraction get turbocharged while in this state of consciousness. Where I jump off the author's train, is when she starts talking about DNA activations and this master cell that supposedly exists within the pineal gland. In yoga and many traditions the pineal gland is overlayed by the crown chakra, the center of which can act as a gateway to the spirit world. Anatomically, however, the pineal gland is just a mass of pinealocytes and glial cells. It is not even a repository of stem cells. The idea that the pineal gland contains a single master cell that governs the genetics of the entire body is pure conjecture on the part of the author backed by zero scientific evidence. It's a disturbing concept, actually. What would happen if that one master cell went into aptosis and died? Would it be replaced, and if so how? Would we die if that happened? The concept of shadow DNA and is also a creation of the author backed by nothing more that her visions which we have no way of authenticating. I will come to the author's defense in stating that her editor is no doubt British, and this will explain the vast majority of what will seem to the American reader as ignorant misspellings (ex programmes, practise etc). To sum up, I'm willing to do a mea culpa and change this to a five star review should I encounter a Theta Healer with incredible skill. The author may be onto something, and may be an innately gifted healer, but this book didn't deliver results for me.ists within the pineal gland.

1567184855|1.0|I had high hopes for this book after reading many regarding NDE's, channelled info from the Great Beyond, etc.  But I cannot believe the Afterlife would be as boring as this book claims....i.e. hanging around in spirit form, with the same soul group you've always incarnated with, attending classes together, waiting for the next round of incarnations.  Ye gods, it sounds like hi school that NEVER ENDS!<br /><br />Not my idea of a wonderful Afterlife. And I agree with other one & two star reviews that the \\"cases\\" aren't very scientific.<br /><br />Regression hypnosis results have NOT been proven totally reliable in many cases, more a product of our imagination--like dreams. I do believe those who have \\"crossed over\\" CAN contact us thru dreams.....I have personally had \\"announcing dreams\\" from deceased relatives about events which came to pass.<br /><br />Wish I had passed on this book.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Breathtaking, it had me at the edge of my seat the whole time. Unimaginable, unpredictable and unsettling, in every way possible, I never knew what to expect, what was coming next. Simply amazing! I loved it.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|Fifty Shades was interesting and I liked the writing style, ie, the way the author phrased ideas. The passion was presented well, but the story didn't develop into anything interesting or, to me, worthwhile.

0345803485|2.0|I found I couldn't spend time on a book that was so depressing. I read the first two<br />and last two chapters and decided the book wouldn't add anything to my life.
B008AU7F3C|5.0|I am an avid Bat for Lashes fan.  I have loved several of her songs, but not any of the albums.  Qualifying that statement: the songs I liked, I really liked.  After listening to the albums several times, I just found myself skipping most of the other songs.  Either the flow was wrong or the song didn't speak to me in the context of the songs I really liked on that particular album (Two Suns or Fur & Gold).<br /><br />Fast forward to Haunted Man.  I had the opportunity thanks to NPR to hear the whole album before the release date and WOW!  I couldn't get enough of it. I just kept hitting replay.  Could be I was just jonesing for some new Bat for Lashes, but after really listening to the album, I believe this album is just put together better and is more dynamic than the other two albums. If you haven't listened to a whole album recently, I invite everyone to give this one a listen; especially if you are already a fan of Bat for Lashes.<br /><br />Cohesive album with great slow and upbeat songs with Natasha Khan's truly amazing vocals and distinctive sound. If you like Shiny Toy Guns new album \\"III\\" in its entirety, here is another CD or complete album to add to the playlist. You won't be disappointed.
B002JCSRKC|3.0|Pros:<br />Keeps feet dry<br />Light weight<br /><br />Cons:<br />Sweaty feet<br />Calf opening too large<br />Stiff<br /><br />My calves have a 15\\" circumference, and these boots' calf opening is too large for my calves. Since there's too much room, whenever I take a step it makes a lot of noise as air gets sucked into the boot and escapes. It's somewhat annoying, but not too hard to get used to. Since these are waterproof boots, they don't let moisture out either, so my feet and my calves are always sweaty. I have to wear thicker knee high socks to help absorb the moisture. I wear these in the snow and rain where I walk several miles a day, and they always keep my feet warm and dry. Despite being in the snow, it does not freeze this Croc foam material it's made out of. I like that it's very lightweight, which matters a lot since rubber boots are very heavy. When I first got these boots, they were *very* stiff and very hard to walk in. After several weeks of heavy walking, they got easier to walk with. I've had these for two years now, and they're still in great condition.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great snow/rain boot. I think it's hard to beat it (for its purpose), but if it's not raining or snowing outside, I'd much prefer other shoes.

I'd like to see what Bruno Mars, Maroon 5, One Direction and Justin Bieber are doing in their 70's. Steven Tyler is a master, as is Joe Perry. They deserve respect and not pity. They've pulled out their genius through time and it has stood the test. So it isn't the \\"old Aerosmith,\\" or the \\"new Aerosmith.\\" It's ludicrous for anyone to expect them to sound like they did 40 years ago, and overly optimistic to expect them to create something very new at their ages. Who does that? Not even Picasso. Gold is gold and Aerosmith is definitely gold!<br /><br />I wanted something pretty and I wanted something wild on this album. \\"Oh Yeah,\\" may not have been wild enough but it almost was and I enjoyed its humor. \\"What Could Have Been Love\\" and \\"Another Last Goodbye,\\" are to be savored for their poignancy and wisdom. I can't imagine a 20-something writing these songs or singing them convincingly. Speaking of which, \\"We All Fall Down\\" rocks us nicely into that feel-good upliftment that so many recent singers have created (Jason Mraz, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga) and which fans need.<br /><br />If you've ever liked Aerosmith and have no ax to grind or ridiculous expectations, you won't go wrong buying this album.
B008O2T3O0|1.0|Why does Amazon's US web site offer European versions on an opera (Rigoletto) that won't play on a US machine? Why is there such a difference in price between the US version and the European version of the same opera? If you buy the $8.99 version of Rigoletto, make sure you have a blu ray player that plays European blu ray disks.
B0060D0S12|4.0|My son subsequently requested &#34;The Christmas Ship&#34; story -- which has a similar nautical theme. We've watched this film more than once in my house!
B009YQJ322|5.0|I wasn't expecting much when I went to see this movie, but the trailer sucked me in so I gave it a shot.  I was really blown away by how good this movie was.  It reminded me of some 80's action flicks - violent, anti-social, yet with ultimately a great redeeming lead hero.  I kept thinking that the director of this movie must have loved John Carpenter movies - like Assault on Precinct 13 or Escape from New York.  It had a kind of paced, character-driven feel, building to the climax, with a great electronic soundtrack.  If you like John Carpenter movies, action flicks, or those 80's violent movies like Robocop, you will like this movie.
0345529057|5.0|Beautiful condition.  Not only was it in the box set container, but it was also plastic wrapped, so the books weren't damaged in any way during shipping.
B0063GORYU|4.0|The game is not as good as I remember on a full computer (especially with the cntl-z undo command) but it does have the full game with easy controls.  There is an automove feature that can be annoying at times (it will make a move with an inadvertent touch of the screen) but it is also easy to see this feature becoming wanted.  The ad support is also a little annoying (but then I find all ads a little annoying) but it only stops the action on the deal (in between games).

B008QE9XD2|3.0|This movie had a brilliant idea which it did not execute properly. I realize its based on an old tv show that most have never seen but that should have been a good thing.<br /><br />For one, why did it take place in the 1970s?  That is not interesting at all. It should have taken place in modern times or at least it should have played around with the time and culture change some more.  Second, there was no consistent tone and too many plot holes.<br /><br />For example, where did Barnaba's descendants come from if he had no children and no obvious brothers or sisters? Also why did he kill those innocent hippies if he was getting blood transfusions? Furthermore why is the fact that he keeps banging Angelique never surface in the eyes of his girlfriend?<br /><br />The plot was full of potential but the outcome was boring. The only highlights of the film were the always pleasurable Eva Green and Johnny Depps characters. The rest were average but underdeveloped. I'm shocked at how little screen time the character of Victoria got. She was a big part of the plot.<br /><br />I'm glad I rented this movie and that I saw it. It's by no means horrible, the visuals are excellent, Tim Burton's style is always a welcome. I just wish it had more depth and a lot more going on. A sequel is teased at the end and I for one would welcome one if the plot was interesting.
1936608618|5.0|A great read for athletes of all fitness levels.  You will improve your technique in all aspect of endurance training.  Great explanations and illustrations throughout the entire book.  I really appreciated the chapter on the \\"broken down athlete\\".  I feel better equipped to prevent, repair, and treat injuries brought on by poor mechanics and tight overworked muscles.  Truly a game changer for any athlete.
0316098329|5.0|This book is, for lack of a better term, freaky. The storyline is bizarre and creepy, but you can't help but keep reading. My friend told me about it and said that he couldn't sleep one night after reading it. This didn't surprise me after I started it, it's just so... out there. From the beginning, the reader knows that something is off. This is probably one of the scariest books I have ever read! I recommend it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love the reading plans.  it is great to have the Bible always accessible.  we have even used the app to read through the Bible as a Sunday school class
1451627289|5.0|This book was the featured book for my monthly Book Club, and we all really enjoyed it. It is a very long book (and also heavy to carry around), but the storyline is great and I was sucked in after about 4 or 5 pages. I would say that the beginning was a tad slow, but I couldn't put it down after a while. Stephen King books never fail to keep me coming back.

B004LWZW6K|3.0|There are some pretty cruddy kills in this movie but all in all it actually came out decent, the budget for the film was around 5 Million Dollars and I think that it looked better than what they paid for.... Minus the fact that they used shots from the first movie in some scenes and just tinted the color to make it look different. On another note I do like that they used more practical fish effects than CGI ones.... They put a lot of effort into this movie and it does somewhat show on screen<br /><br />Plot: Maddy (Danielle Panabaker) has just returned to her hometown for college spring break to find out that her idiotic stepfather (David Koechner) has turned her childhood memories into a sexual nightmare, her very own 49% of their waterpark has turned into 51% of the stepfathers own, sensual fantasies. But if that wasn't enough a school of vicious prehistoric Piranha has returned to a new lake located next to the waterpark and her stepfather (being the moron he is) has put a well near the waterpark to get free water which leaves an easy access for the Piranha to enter and cause another massacre!<br /><br />Review: Some directors like to push the envelope to create something farfetched and still obtain that gross out fun factor, John Gulager is one of those directors who tries so hard to push that seal open and sometimes he succeeds straight up (Feast), but other times he only makes it halfway (Piranha 3DD) and sometimes he nearly demolishes it (Feast 2 and 3). Piranha 3DD is a no-brainer when it comes to entertainment it want's fans and critiques to numb their minds and make fun out of everything on the screen, some fans/critiques unfortunately cannot and I respect that it shows that they want a seriously superb movie. For me I like films of all genres and categories.... Everything from Piranha 3DD to Prometheus. This little flick came out when I was still Piranha Hungry and when I saw the trailer I thought \\"yes it is going to be much different in many ways such asthe feeling of the movie, the seriousness level (which pretty much was absent in this movie), and the humor tone of the movie! Alexandre Aja created the Perfect and my favorite B-Movie (which was the first 3d remake of Piranha) and he did it with everything in place. There were some scenes in Piranha 3d that genuinely freaked/grossed me out and in Piranha 3DD there is some differences, the top three kills felt truly forced, one of them was impossible and the other acted like something out of a final destination movie. The whole movie felt a bit forced but I can live with it, the question is.... How much can you take un-seriously before giving up?<br /><br />Acting: Danielle Panabaker, Christopher Lloyd, Paul Scheer, David Koechner, Katrina Brown, Gary Busey, Clu Gulager and even David Hasslehoff were all excellent in their roles.... Especially David Hasslehoff whose character was portrayed perfectly (Hint, he played himself).<br /><br />Gore: The top three kills that I mentioned earlier involved two decapitations (one impossible and the other funny yet disturbing), and a spear (trident) impalement in the face... the rest we get is a piranha chewing a guy's ass, lots of blood, grisly corpses, a severed hand, and more! It was gory enough, still, I am glad they didn't go extremely farfetched with the gore!<br /><br />Bottom Line: Double the trouble but double the silliness makes this flick decent in my book. It is on a par with Sharktopus in my opinion and I'm sticking to it. I do hope they make a sequel, there are so many more settings such as a bar, a casino, a school.... The possibilities are endless!<br /><br />Rated R for sequences of strong bloody horror violence and gore, graphic nudity, sexual content, language, and some drug use<br /><br />(Exact Same MPPA Rating as the first movie ha ha)<br /><br />Is it worth the Buy on a scale of 1-10: 5<br />For the Movie itself on a scale of 1-5: 3
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My whole family loves this movie!  It's great!  Very cute and keep all 4 of my kids entertained!  Their ages are from 2-8.  Definitely recommend getting this for your family!

B0046MOVD0|5.0|loved resident evil from the first release until the latest.  great stuff.  hope to see more.  great addition to my movie collections.
B009AZZEU2|3.0|Soundgarden is a great band. I have liked or loved all of their albums including King Animal. \\"Bones of Birds\\" is my favorite song from  the album. There are two or three songs that haven't made it to my iPod play list. \\"Rowing\\" reminded me of songs from Badmoterfinger.  I was only slightly disappointed. But this album is good. The blend of sounds of their older works as well as new sounds make this a must for fans have been waiting for a new album from Soundgarden. Overall I would recommend King Animal.

This is one of my Favorite Punk Rock bands since I found them.  Great blend of music and sounds vocals are top notch.  Just go out and buy this album.
B004AP9W46|5.0|Read this for the second or third time.  I think it totally sums up the Vampire Chronicles, and leaves you pondering what it all means.  Excellent.
B00961ZESW|5.0|Her biggest hit so far &#34;Call Me Maybe&#34;.  I decided to get this album for the wife because this is not typically my music.  This album is very upbeat and everything sounds good.  They need to play more of her stuff on the radio instead of making her look like a 1 hit wonder.
B007SGM084|5.0|Wonderful story from the very first to the third!!! I feel in love with the characters and would love for this to be a series. The author really gave the characters so much thought that they could easily continue on.....

B007ONSLLQ|5.0|I thought their first album was amazing, but this one just blows it out of the water.  This is a great band with a lot of talent.  I saw them in concert one year and they were awesome can't wait to see them again!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|One of the best Grisham books that I have read in years. Thoroughly entertaining, with twists and turns. Would definitely reccomend it.
B008B3H4VQ|4.0|This is a step up from their previous album.  Their previous album was to techno like and not the Linkin Park that I enjoyed listening to.  Living Things has a bunch of different styles in it.  It is still no Hybrid Theory but they are trying to change.&#34;
1451638450|5.0|I really enjoy this author's work, and especially this series, very tongue in cheek in some areas with some in-jokes here and there
B009DB60W4|5.0|The album was bought back from Nuclear Blast and self released, then put out on this independent label, because NB did not like the album as it was. The main issue was obtaining permission for covering the original songs. As well they really didn't like the album much either and doing an album of all French songs seemed odd. I'm not a big fan of the borderline pornographic artwork (although some people like it) although it is interesting and well done I don't think it would be worth the trouble of dealing with copyright issues on 12 or so songs. So it was released in the United States where there isn't as much red tape. However, the joke was on nuclear blast because this album seems to have done well.<br /><br />Unless you are already familiar with the original songs you would think this was just another Therion album, only done in a different language. In fact this is like a French version of Secret of the Runes. By that I don't mean it sounds like SOTRs I mean it is a good album from start to finish with a consistent \\"theme\\" and sound. This is different from some Therion albums (like Lemuria/Sirius b) which are just a random assortment of very good songs that don't really have anything in common with each other. So this is one of those albums where its worth listening to the whole album all the way through even if there may be a few parts you skip over to get to the better ones. This album has a distinct feel to it and when you listen to one of the songs you are automatically transported to this sexualized French type of world. SOTRs by comparison is in Germanic languages (Swedish, English, Old German), and transports you to a Norse mythological world.<br /><br />Probably the weirdest thing about this album is that the lyrics are a little more sexual in nature rather than mythological. But even though they are covers, the lyrics are still Therion. I mean sexuality is nothing new to Therion, but is a little more emphasized in this album. Take La Maritza (probably the best song on the album) very cool \\"dark\\" yet passionate lyrics about death, so it's not all sexual.<br /><br />This is the best Therion album done in a while. Although great albums, the previous two Therion albums (Gothic Kabbalah and Sitra Ahra) were generally not as well liked as most Therion albums. Some fans consider GK to be their best album and so on, but the majority of fans consider them not as good. Sure they had some of Therion's best work, but they also had a lot of songs that sounded more like a mainstream band rather than Therion as well as lame songs (usually every song is great in a Therion album).<br /><br />One reason the previous two albums weren't as well liked was that Therion strayed from what they do best and attempted to blend every music style possible into one album. And they experimented with too many different styles of singing (and guest vocals) in those albums. Here Therion goes back to what they do best with a primarily operatic album with only a touch of metal vocals. We don't have to deal with annoying guest vocalists. Most of whom don't really fit well with Therion's music anyway. As well the \\"symphony\\" is really fantastic in Les Fleurs Du Mal. A combination of traditional French sounds with classical instrumentation, great symphonic introductions and great symphony through the whole album. The strings (such as violens) are prominent in this album. This has some of the best symphonic elements Therion has done. This is also a departure from the medicore mostly keyboard driven sounds of Sitra Ahra and Gothic Kabbalah.<br /><br />So when Nuclear Blast decided they didn't like this album, everybody was expecting that Therion had finally died since GK and Sitra Ahra were lagging in sales and onlya fraction of Therion's fans were getting enthusiastic about those albums. It was going to be another ho hum album like the previous two, in fact it was going to be worse. The internet came alive with buzz about how much this album sucked. People were curious. Therion has done a few business as usual not too exiting albums before but never released anything that sucked. In reality it is quite the opposite. This is a reversal of Therion's downhill trend. So everybody went out and bought this album and discovered it was good. Meanwhile Therion Mastermind Christofer Johnson claims this was his plan all along. The fact that an album totally in French would probably be a total flop for most bands really doesn't apply to Therion. It totally fits in with the rest of their music catalog and just creates an even richer atmosphere to their already large lineup of unique albums.<br /><br />The album really flows well, it has some really good \\"hit\\" songs, no songs that really suck. It has its own unique sound, but still Therion. Everything came together just right for this album. Therion does what they do best in here by having a mostly operatic performance with only a touch of rock and metal vocals here and there. The symphony comes back great and the band does a top notch performance keeping everything very melodic and complex. The only thing missing is that there is only one guitar solo on the entire album. Yet these kinds of songs are less guitar driven than some other Therion albums. The album is not quite as heavy as most Therion albums and we can't really call this metal. It's more of an opera rock album with some metal influences and some heavier parts to it. So some people are disappointed that it's not heavy enough, but most people like it.<br /><br />The hit songs on this album are:<br /><br />\\"La Maritza\\" a nice bitter sweet opera about death (primarily female soprano). This really becomes a different song from the original due to Therion's more classical interpretation.<br />J Ai Le Mal De Toi is an amazing vocal performance by Thomas Vikstrom very radio friendly Opera rock type song, based on a tragedy of a star who had it all, lost it all then killed herself.<br /><br />Then there's Poupée De Cire, Poupée De Son a heavy opera metal piece (is there some punk rock influence here a la Guns n' Roses?) that opens up the album, and another version of the song ends it. Both versions are great.<br /><br />Une Fleur Dans Le Coeur is really good but then the heavy metal vocals at the end of the song ruin the mood a bit but still pretty good. Those are the main hits.<br /><br />Dis-Moi Poupée is also an incredible performance by Snowy and the only guitar solo on the album and definately the best song on the album for those who are fans of a more \\"metal\\" therion. It's not a heavy song, but just a great vocal performance by snowy for those bored with pure opera. For relaxing with a glass of wine La Licorne D Or is perfect. Many great ones. Some songs like Lilith really have a more rock or punk rock feel than heard in any previous Therion album.<br /><br />Overall a fantastic album. La Maritza is one of my all time favorite songs now.
B000FA5SMK|3.0|Enjoyed the snappy, witty dialog.  Story line was good but dragged a bit.  Certainly readable, but not DeMille's best work.
0547884591|5.0|This book rounds out the trilogy of awesomeness. I waited a year for my pre-order and it was everything that I hoped it would be. Tim packs so much value into his books. This book could actually be 10 books but he is so efficient it could be just one long book. If you enjoy the book I highly recommend his other books: The Four Hour Workweek and the Four Hour Body. These books can make you a more educated, healthier and a generally well-rounded person. His philosophy on life has given me great wisdom on how live my life and to do the things that I love most. The world should thank Tim Ferriss for his excellent contribution.

B00018TI5E|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums ever. Every single song on this album has a special space in my heart. The vocal harmonies that John or Josh do on these songs are beautiful.

0061733199|5.0|Has info on EVERYTHING.hunting, tracking, cooking, edible plants, first aid etc. Not light reading but definitely a must have book if you're venturing out into the wild or prepping.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|One of the best movies of the &#34;Marvel&#34; series..... Couldn't have picked the actors any better. A Definite must have for your collection.
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|Rick Riordan shows (again) how to write a book full of knowledge without being academical or loosing the story rithym!
B007HACDLK|5.0|This one i read in a day and a half. Couldn't put it down!  Mitch Rapp is the man. Wish we had about  a million of him!  Maybe we could rid this country of some of the crooked politicians that I am sure are just like joe rickman!
B001FB4VY4|5.0|I love the big bang theory show it really nice to own on blu ray well worth it nothing to complain about.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Good for quick, easy game.  Still only doing two suits.  Needs some strategy...but not too difficult...yet.  I'm ready to move up and make it need a little more thought.
B0053O89XI|5.0|big bang theory is still amazingly funny and its on its 6 season. i love this show and is even better on blu ray nothing to complain about.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This game requires you to think! It also requires planning. You get better scores when you bet a certain time so you also have that aspect that makes it fun and challenging. My husband Loved angry bird and he hasnt went back to them since we got Bad Piggies on the kindle. Whole family LOVES it!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|they all looked good but think the picture could have looked better their are blurry spots on corners and parts of pictures mainly on the 4,5,6 the older ones, I love them all but I was expecting more. I would like a double dip were they do a better job restoring and cleaning up the pictures and fixing other issues with the movies.
B003YL4KS0|4.0|Turns out I've been caring for my hair all wrong! I loved this book not only for the hair care and styling education SPECIFIC to curlies, but also for the stories. I can relate to so many of them. This book helped me really like my curls (maybe for the first time in my life) because now I have a better understanding of how to work WITH them instead of constantly fighting against them. It's not just a matter of letting your curls go the way they want to go, but promoting curl with the right styling techniques and products. My hair has more bounce and less frizz than I can remember ever having before.<br /><br />While Lorraine does mention her haircare product line, it's not pushy at all. Rather, she also talks about homemade cleansers and teaches how to read labels so you can make better decisions on what products to buy for better results. I will add however, that I do highly recommend her DevaCurl conditioner. It's lightweight, smells nice, makes detangling a snap and is seriously the best conditioner I've ever used. I also tried a couple of the homemade deep conditioning treatments... but these I found only marginally helpful in restoring moisture to my hair. Mainly the treatments were time consuming and just made my hair feel weighted down and rather dull.<br /><br />Overall though, the usefulness of this book (for frustrated curly girls and guys) cannot be overstated. After replacing all the haircare products in our house with a brand that uses more natural ingredients, and none of the \\"ingredients to avoid\\", even my teenage son (who has shaggy, longish hair and wild curls) has seen an improvement in how much more manageable his hair is.<br /><br />An easy read and worth every penny. I wish it had been around 25 years ago.
B007N5YIUS|3.0|It is definitely challenging but again, the kids like it better.  I play it when I am looking for more difficult agnry bird challenges.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I like how the game progresses. Overall I'm not a huge game player but this keeps my and my child's interest.
B007N85POS|4.0|We have really enjoyed playing the games and even though some are very challenging, like the large view and clear pictures
B007HACDLK|5.0|Fast paced couldn't put down my kindle. Can't wait for the next one to come out. I will be first in line.
B006JSXYPA|5.0|mil gracias por el producto fabuloso recomiendo a este vendedor todo llego en perfectas condiciones excelente<br />saludos espero seguir contando con ustedes
B0069JBKHI|5.0|Decided to upgrade the monitor for the second child, and wish we had bought this for the first.  All features function as advertised and many better than expected.  When I am in the market for a scale or blood pressure monitor (as those are the only other products they make), I will certainly go directly back to Withings.
1608871452|5.0|Fantastic job of assembling images and information.<br />All true Supernatural fans need a copy of this in the trunk of their Impala!
B009GESJH2|3.0|As a long time Kid Rock fan, each new release has given me much listening pleasure - until now.  A couple of the songs sucked me in but most of the disc left me wanting to play other Kid Rock instead.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|We are sci fi and horror lovers in my house and we love the classic alien movies. It's part of our childhood.
B000HCPU0Q|5.0|I chose this rating because The Singles is more than I expected. It should be a must for all fans of The Clash.
B005ERX20E|5.0|This is a earlier movie from Angela Jolie and one of my favorites. Its a great true story that is tragic.
B007HC3LHS|1.0|I would not rate this book worth buying or reading.  Luckily it was an Amazon Deal of the Day last week when I bought it.<br /><br />It is very long and very repetitious.  Really boring.  I kept reading it to see if it would become more interesting but it never<br />did so.<br /><br />The protagonist, Catharine, was so bland and the book is all told in first person.  It skips between two time periods.<br /><br />It may have been a very interesting read because it deals with hot topics like domestic violence and OCD and PTSD.  But<br />except for the awful violence nothing was truly explored.
B004EPYZUI|4.0|We like the action. You need to pay attention or you won't understand the movie. I have no complaints at all.
B00684J49U|5.0|Was well worth money!  I did not have to wait to watch episodes online in between commercials.  It was great to get caught up before this season started :)
0060589280|2.0|I didn't enjoy this book. I normally enjoy most of Paulo's works but the main character was very annoying and wasn't written well. It was frustrating reading her preaching on a subject she knew so little about. I wouldn't recommend this book.
B000JNOO7I|2.0|Buying this download was a big disappointment. 4:3 aspect ratio and looks more like a vhs transfer than a DVD transfer. I can't wait until someone does a good blu ray of this one.
0312330537|5.0|This book is so well written, it is very thought provoking and full of amazingly described characters who you feel you know quite well as the story unfolds. The story is thrilling and takes you on quite a ride.<br /><br />I have read this book a few times. The first time I read it too quickly, I was unable to put it down or sleep at night until I had finished a chapter then the next.. I wanted to know what would happen next but at the same time I was willing myself to read more slowly and take in all the great insights provided in the book. I urge you to read the book slowly, take your time digesting it. It is a wonderful book that has been beautifully written and when I read it the second time I would take time out to ponder and take in what I had just read before continuing on with the story.<br /><br />I read this book before going to India and it made the experience so much richer. I loved seeing the head waggle in person and I dined at Leopolds hoping to get a glimpse of the author who apparently still frequents there on a regular basis.<br /><br />This book is a great read and I regularly recommend it and buy it as a gift for others to read.
B005ZMUWWY|1.0|i bought it movie... i supposed to be able to download it to my pc but i can't even do and it's such a bad graphic .. waste of money
0062082353|5.0|It's amazing just what our soldiers are required to do and ask no questions. Enjoyed the first hand accounts with no pleasurism. Once I start resding these boks, I find it very difficult to put it down.
B000NQRE9Q|2.0|I have seen Raiders presented in HD on USA and on ABC a few times recently and I have a D-VHS copy of it recorded off ABCHD in 720P and it looks much better than this bluray release.  The exposures seem off many times and the film grain seems to be excessive.  The scene where Indy and Marion are at Sala's house in Cairo opens with them on the veranda and the exposure seems off there.  In the past this scene is brightly lit and contrasty with the white clothing and white stucco buildings brilliantly displayed against the sunny blue skies.  It seems very muted on the Blu-ray transfer and again the film grain is annoying and I don't recall it being a problem in the past.  The scene where Indy is standing by lake before entering the cave during the opening scene shows the exposure issues as well.  It's sloppy at best.  I have yet to watch the other 3 but I feel like I wasted my money on this.  Any reviewer giving this disc more than 2 stars for Picture Quality is delusional.

B005LAIHXQ|1.0|Upon watching this 2 hour train wreck unravel before my very eyes, I couldn't help but think of my beloved Tony Scott and wonder if he was really the sibling suffering from brain cancer.<br /><br />There really aren't enough words to describe how truly awful 'Prometheus' is, but if anyone out there can reply to this review and inform me just what in the hell was/is going on in this strange, mystical canyon bottom...that would be terrific.<br /><br />No spoilers here, but from what I could gather, some archeologists find some cave paintings and link every cave painting ever discovered to this strange, mystical planet (with the canyon bottom).  It seems odd right off the bat because the paintings and/or etchings are just stick figures any mongoloid would draw pointing to the sky with a couple of circles that, I suppose, represent this moon/planet.<br /><br />This is where civilization started, but the creators aren't very nice and, from what I could gather, they have created so many terrifying species that nobody can keep track of them all.  You have worms, snakes, lizards, guys who look like the character Powder, squids, and zombies.  There's horrifying black ink, eggs that glow, mosaics that morph, hollow structures with scary-Crazy Horse size skulls carved into them, decapitated bodies, and epic dust storms.  I think Ridley Scott wants us to think that the creators are on a plot to destroy mankind and this must be the case because the pretty archeologist says so even though she just went through an incredible surgery on her abdomen (she's a quick healer, folks).<br /><br />It's really a complete and total mess and it was difficult for this viewer to truly know exactly what was going on because there are so many different creatures/alien forms to keep track of.  The zombie bit didn't make a lick of sense to me and I was just hopin' Charlize Theron would just torch everyone (including herself, the crew and myself), but at least she got run over by a spaceship.<br /><br />I mean, man...man, I...I'm trying to remember a collection of dumber characters assembled in one film.  These top of the line scientists embark on a field trip of the dumbest decision making ever captured on film and it's hard to even attempt to enjoy a movie/story when there is so much cerebral floundering taking place.  At least the majority of them get killed, I guess.  Sometimes the dumb really deserve that.  I mean, when your dumb-as-hell neighbor has his garbage disposal running and drops two kernels of Orville Redenbachers into it and then thrusts his arm down there, do you really feel sorry for him?  Of course you don't.  Don't pretend that you do!<br /><br />Adding insult to injury, the android in the movie looks like Michael Score from A Flock Of Seagulls.  I kept waiting for him to pull his keyboard out and start rotating around the spaceship/set piece made of aluminum foil.<br /><br />Just really disappointing and really, truly awful.  No true redeeming qualities to it at all and the very ending made me barf in complete disgust.br />I mean, man...man, I...I'm trying to remember a collection of dumber characters assembled in one film.

B00A0SQBDM|4.0|Fun game. Good  graphics, Make you feel as if you are there. Mini games are very simple. Good way to kill a few hours.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|The book was excellent.. and the movie actually did it justice. Highly recommended. I would recommend reading it fierst, makes the movie just that much better
B008H6GH8I|5.0|Damnation kicks up the everything from Degeneration and makes it even better. The story seems kind of conviluted but its worth the watch and also comes with the digital stream like all Sony products.
B0010T0OCY|5.0|Dark City---Tightly made, great, fresh performances, big picture special fx,  has the feel of an epic movie developed through one special character, akin to but better than Matrix.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I'm not through with this one yet but loved the first two and expect nothing less of this one. Can't you see an early Richard Gereplaying him? It's like Pretty Woman all over again.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|My 16-year-old granddaughter and friends (boys and girls) were first to watch this movie and they all liked it a lot. I watched it with my 4- and 5-year-old grandchildren and they loved it, but they wanted to sit on my lap during the part where the old enchanted bear attacked.<br /><br />The animation was beautiful and the story was great. I loved that it was ultimately about healing relationships. Merida is not a typical Disney princess who gets rescued; she learns that she is capable and it's up to her to set right what she did wrong. That's a valuable lesson.
B008WCP2PG|4.0|About time ladies had some naked skin to look at. Channing is super hot and Matthew is very entertaining. Will be a repeat movie in my house.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I could not put this book down. Written in two voices (the husband and the wife), I was kept wondering exactly what happened to Amy until well into the book and it was quite a surprise. The suspens then becomes if or when the guilty person will be found out and held accountable. Many twists and turns and a very enjoyable read.
0812993292|5.0|The simplest thing I can say about this book is that it is outstanding. I could tell you about how heartbreaking and adorable Harold is. I could go on about the sad state of his marriage to his wife Maureen. Then I could babble about how the character development is sublime and natural. I could tell you about the times that I couldn't stop the tears from falling as I read beautiful passages, about how at times I would suck in my breath at the loveliness of some of the quotes. Perhaps I should tell you that you'll know nothing at the beginning but by the end will feel that you know everything worth knowing?<br /><br />What I will say is this: This novel is a must read.<br /><br />Jennifer @ The Relentless Reader
B009OA57MI|1.0|The game kept freezing up on my Kindle Fire. Would not recommend it, but it has potential to be good if the problem was fixed.
1401324649|5.0|Crazy, silly, sweet, quirky, hilarious. Every page in this book is action packed and you'll have no idea what is going to happen next. Go ahead and guess, you'll never be able to predict a damn thing. This was an absolute joy to read...it was like listening to your funny drunken uncle trying to give a history lesson. Delightful!<br /><br />FYI, the book was originally rejected by firms in the U.K. and in the U.S. (Fools! Fools, I tell you!)<br /><br />Read this book. If you have to beg, borrow, or steal it...do so!<br /><br />I'm serious...what are you waiting for?<br /><br />Jennifer @ The Relentless Reader
0060751967|3.0|I admit, I must be the last person in the world to read this series.  After seeing everyone rave about them, and even hosting the author on my blog, I decided to dive into the Love At Stake series by author Kerrelyn Sparks.<br /><br />The first half of this book I thought was rather cliched.  While I found it funny at times, other times I found myself rolling my eyes at some of the story.  Not only was the dialogue cheesy, but so was the plot.  Then after I got past the first half of the story, it really started to pick up and really grab my interest.  I did like the authors writing style though and the side characters were ones I can't wait to read about -- especially those kilt wearing/sexy talking Highlanders!<br /><br />While I am not completely sold on the series yet, this is definitely one that I am going to continue reading.  I am interested to know how the Vampire \\"Civil War\\" is going to play out now that there has been a dramatic change in hierarchy. With the fall of one and the partnership of another, you can't help but wonder what side is going to win.  I also like the side story of the Stake-Out Division of the CIA and the impact they will have for future stories.<br /><br />For an old time paranormal romance mood, this one fits the bill on the quirky side.  Not one to take seriously, but one that will definitely leave you smiling.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|Nothing super exciting, just a bunch of action packed comics that provide some hours of entertainment.<br />Some people may like it more than others though.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this app... Really like I've been looking for great sounding ambience for years and now I've got it Thank You Ipnos Software Inc Y'all the bomb like TickTick.
B001JNNDGA|5.0|One of the most realistic depictions about what happened about 2000 years ago.  In about 3 years, this man literally split our reckoning of time, and has caused more change than every other influential people put together.<br />Obviously he is who he said he was.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|I purchased this case (pink) in December 2011 along with my Kindle Fire.  (The KF has given me countless hours of pleasure, to say the least.) The cover is light-weight (a plus)and still remains in great condition, including the elastic closure band.  However, the 'stand' feature needs improvement. Since I use this on my kitchen counter when referring to recipes, I wish it were more 'sturdy' and remained in place while in the 'stand' position; it keeps flopping over. I find this very frustrating and believe there is room for improvement in this area.  Otherwise, it's a great product for me.
034552554X|5.0|with excellent info. on flowers.  I've sent for sev. more to give as gifts (with the appropriate flower, of course).
B009E3EXMU|5.0|It is amazing that a Led Zeppelin tour did not materialize after this concert.  I guess we can all keep dreaming.  This may be the closest we ever get....  still as good as ever.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|Really good game! Smooth flow and the interaction is excellent. Fun way to spend an afternoon. I would reccomend it, definitely.
B00004T9VY|5.0|Tea for the tillerman was one of cat's best albums, His folk style moved a generation, Great to be able to get his works, and listen again to the music we loved
1451695195|5.0|Written by someone not religiously motivated, so the credibility factor works here. My wife passed this year so I'm interested in this doctors reflections.
B000YHG72E|5.0|We LOVE this movie!!!! all year long we enjoy the quotes.<br />shopping in stores with escalators will never be the same!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Me encanto y me gusto mucho más q el primero.... Love it!!!! Realmente no me esperaba nada me tuvo todo el tiempo en ansia!!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Stunning, heart-opening movie starring senior citizens...well, primarily.  Anyone will enjoy this lovely film about humanity, culture, aspiration and perspiration.  A keeper!
B008I43DYU|5.0|Big screen and does what its supposed to. Not much else to say about a simple calculator in twenty or more words.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I am completely addicted to this show!  It is very well done - story lines great, acting is very good and the zombies look incredible.  Get it!!!
1594203334|5.0|This is not a review. It's a testimonial. While I am past the age of having children myself, I read this book last year when it first came out. I'm an inveterate Francophile, so I tend to read new titles about French culture and lifestyle, thinking there are things we might learn from them. I found Bringing Up Bébé both sensible and entertaining, so when my husband's daughter and then his son announced that they were expecting ... one last November, the other six months later, I bought a copy for each couple.  Today, one of our granddaughters is a year old, the other six months.  The six month old is &#34;doing her nights&#34; and has been for a while now.  The year old was the same. Both little girls eat everything and on a regular schedule. Needless to say, we all attribute these &#34;miracles&#34; to Pamela Druckerman's lovely book. I can definitely attest that it's a great gift for expectant parents. Nicely written too. I especially like that the book portrays how a society might care for its youngest members and preserve the happiness and well-being of its families, if only we were willing to consider the French model. So you don't have to be a parent or grandparent to appreciate what this book has to offer. Anyone who cares about children and families and the policies affecting them would probably gain something from reading this book.
0345529057|1.0|I read the first book because my husband said it was a good read.  I found this author's writing style interferes with the story.  The only character that I even remotely care about is Tynian and even he cannot induce me to read any of the rest of the books.  The characters do not inspire any emotion on my part with the exception of disgust with the waste of my time.  \\"Winter is coming\\"?  Maybe, but by the time it gets here we will all be dead.  I Hope.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Laughed, cried, screamed &#34;nnoooooo!&#34;  Can't pass the local REI store without grinning.  Will give a copy to my mom for Christmas with a note that we are both very blessed.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is the best book in the trilogy.  It is the true love story of Christian and Ana.  Thank you E L James!
1846467640|3.0|We love Peppa and I was surprised that these books are ITTY BITTY.  I'm going to use them as a stocking stuffer.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Love this trilogy!  Couldn't put the book down.  Can&#34;t wait for the next one!  The end of December can't get here soon enough!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Great story- as I always. I wish he would write more and the Mitch Rapp Movie is becoming closer from what I hear.
B008KRJWEK|4.0|This game is really good for people who like zombies and roadkill its really fun i wish the prices werent overpriced and overall its reall good i recommend to anyone.
B007HACDLK|5.0|If this isn't Vice Flynn's best book, it rates right up there.  Mitch never changes (thank goodness) and this is a page turner if there ever was one.  I can't wait for his next adventure.  Keep them coming, Mr. Flynn.
B004FP1WX0|5.0|It is an interesting look at why people misrepresent themselves on the Internet. I think that the film is also done in a merciful manner towards people who could have easily been lambasted and ridiculed. It was very entertaining and although you knew what the outcome would inevitably be, it was interesting to watch the characters develop through the course of the movie.
0399157565|3.0|Like so many other reviewers, I had hope that this book would see a return to the flawed but inspiring characters that drew me to these books in the first place. The plot lines remain mildly interesting and I appreciate the detail of the science, but these characters are so flawed and their lives seem so dismal that it is not only depressing but hard to believe.  I find myself wondering if I missed a book in the series (nope), skipped a chapter accidentally (nope), or telling myself that their lives outside of these books must be better and we just get the worst moments. And Kay Scarpetta; how can someone so successful and respected in her field be under attack so constantly by her peers, colleagues, friends and family, let alone criminals.  Sadly, I think this is the last Scarpetta novel for me. Kind of breaks my heart.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Installed this on new Kindle for Christmas. Now I can have my tablet back and the kids have theirs. They love this game.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The first book was the best, this one was more wrapping up loose ends, not much action. Boring ending which was the biggest disappointment.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Installed this on new Kindle for Christmas. Now I can have my tablet back and the kids have theirs. They love this game.
B009JBZH54|4.0|this item was preordered,  It will be nice to have on the night that it is released for movie night....thanks
B005HSL626|5.0|Installed this on new Kindle for Christmas. Now I can have my tablet back and the kids have theirs. They love this game.
1451695195|5.0|A wonderful book written by a doctor who comes to terms with his near death experience. He learns about love and the connections of all living beings to each other. It is a great journey to another reality which not many of us are blessed to take, so we have people like Eben who fortunately take the time to tell us about it.  I would rather believe in an afterlife and be wrong, than to NOT believe. Belief in a place that transcends this earthly realm is what makes the idea of death bearable. He takes us there.
0547884591|5.0|Just finished this book and would definitely recommend it...I liked how there was a lot more to it than cooking (like the basketball section, I wish I'd known about the dominant eye back when I played in HS, haha)<br /><br />After reading a lot of the negative reviews, I'm convinced most didn't even read the book, rather they're just success haters!
B007SGM084|5.0|COULDNT PUT IT DOWN. READ ALL THREE BOOKS IN FOUR NIGHTS AND I DONT USUALLY READ.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TRILOGY
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Fall of Giants is interesting and informative.  A history lesson told though the eyes of very interesting characters. A great read.<br /><br />  Erika Gutman
B009S8PEHY|5.0|Love Rod Stewart. Did not expect to love him doing traditional Christmas songs. Yet I do. His gravelly voice comes through on all the old favorites and makes them his!
B00978V35C|5.0|I really like this album, whereas alot of Robert Cray's songs are about cheating, this one has some good songs about the times we're all trying to get through.  I really like the piano.<br />  I'm always happy to listen to some Robert Cray and this one is a winner
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Good message and well done for the most part. Kelly MacDonald was my favorite and overall it was very family friendly although my 4 year old granddaughter was frightened during the scenes with the bear at the end.
B00124BNF4|5.0|It's the talking heads!  These folks have been making me sing along for a good chunk of my life and I never get tired of listening
B0049P1VHS|5.0|great price good deal,I am looking forward to make more purchase.hope to order walking dead ,second season if available at same price.
B0000AKCLS|5.0|Although it is considered old, it is one of his many best. I highly recommend. Great for parties and get togethers for the holiday. A must have for the blues enthusiast
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Amazon is a pretty good source if you don't have cable. The show is beyond awesome. You won't be disappointed.
B00A0A6F7C|5.0|All the songs are worthy of &#34;standing ovations&#34;, but Susan's rendition of Abba's &#34;Winner Takes It All&#34; is absolutely HAUNTING.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Not lived up to the hype in my opinion.  I wont be off to the hardware store anytime soon either!??!!
B00914JWSW|3.0|Would recommend listening to all the tracks first to see which ones you like the most and downloading only those as there is a fairly wide diaspora of genres, composers, and time periods represented on this compilation.
1451695195|5.0|This is an awesome book. My daughter is questioning God like we all do at some point in our lives. I'm buying this book for her and many others for Christmas. Pj Robinson
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|I love this book.  Puts the magic back into the holidays.  Had the book when my children were young,  now I am going to give it to my Grand Daughter.  I will get one for all my Grand Children.
B009FXIICK|4.0|Retro arcade style game. Not bad graphics, just how they look and act. The animals make funny faces. A kid would probably enjoy it more, but I prefer the rich colors of bejeweled, personally. Worth getting. HTC Inspire.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn does it again with another great book.  I preordered the book and wasn't able to put it down once I got it in hand.
B002U6EWZ6|5.0|Great movie, funny yet inspiring...so true that guys think they cant fall for anyone...grab the popcorn and enjoy it ladies
B009VSW15Y|4.0|Has frozen only once so far.<br /><br />Initially I thought apps like this would be free.<br />Now I see that Amazon intends to nickle and dime a profit from my purchase of a Kindle . Until something better comes along, I'm happy.
0547884591|4.0|About 1/4 of the way through The 4-Hour Chef and I'm really impressed! This book combines many of the principles taught in The 4-Hour Workweek and The 4-Hour Body and gives you the tools to learn potentially anything quickly. The book is absolutely gorgeous and a great evolution of the 4-Hour family.<br /><br />Tim, great job with this book! It's interesting, entertaining, and very helpful for someone like me who wants to spend more time doing the things I love, and less doing the things I dread.<br /><br />Readers, I highly encourage at least reading [[ASIN:0307465357 The 4-Hour Workweek: Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere, and Join the New Rich (Expanded and Updated)]] before diving in. Not only will it help you understand where Tim is coming from, but it could help you make more of your priorities in less time and infinite of cash flow.
B007THA4FI|1.0|You would think the woman who wrote the Harry P. books would have a larger vocabulary than just filth.  Very disappointing.
B004BC7MRM|5.0|Lots of great songs on this album.  Very few explicit lyrics!  Care has a great message and Martina McBride singing with Kid.
034580404X|5.0|I chose this rating because everything was shipped fast and and product was great<br />I recommend this book to everyone was very interesting
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|fun game. easy to earn money, lumber and food. expansion to town is affordable and easy. just now starting to have issues with game closing when trying to &quot;buy&quot; goods in the store,  if this continues, I will have to change my rating!

1594744769|4.0|First off I have to say I can't believe I waited this long to read Riggs creepy photograph filled story of peculiar children. Finding out the eerie photos were actually taken from personal collections added a disturbing quality to the read.<br /><br />Jacob is our main character. He has seen his grandfather's strange pictures and listened to his stories thinking that they were just that...stories. Stories of levitating children and invisible boys were just fairy tales to him until he discovers his grandfather dead and sees something that changes the course of Jacob's life.<br /><br />Jacob no realizes the \\"monsters\\" his grandfather has been fighting are not from his memories of WWII but are actually monsters. Now he must travel to the island where is grandfather stayed and where Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is located. The island is the typical strange island with its quirky residents. After arriving, Jacob goes on the hunt for the orphanage only to find it destroyed and abandoned. What happened to the children? The answer is soon found and leads Jacob on a fantastic journey of discovery and time travel.<br /><br />I love every character involved in this haunting tale. Each one stood out on their own and Riggs ties each and every one of them together seamlessly. The story telling is amazing and with the added photos makes it easier for the reader to visualize the children. Riggs also answers all the questions that burn inside the reader from the start yet leaves a few things in the air for maybe another book.<br /><br />Wonderful original characters and an inventive plot lead this read to be a good one to pick up. I loved the added historical aspects thrown in to provide a bit of realism to the story and the vintage photographs were just a bonus. If you are looking for a unique tale, this is the one for you.
1451695195|5.0|If you believe in an after life this book will help you believe there's more than today.  The doctor painted a picture of the after life, but how he was brought back from death.  Reading his accounts I don't think you could believe anything else than he was saved from death for some reason.
006207394X|5.0|I'm an Agatha Christie Junkie. I'm in the process of reading all of her books - this is a personal goal of mine!  Well, I am starting with the good ones first. I define good as those with above a 4.5 rating on Amazon and also mentioned frequently on the top best lists.  This is definitely an overlooked gem!  It often gets neglected due to the fame of \\"Ten Little Indians\\" and \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\".  While this book may not have as big of a 'twist' as some of her other works, like \\"Who Murdered Rodger Ackroyd\\" this book \\"Sad Cypress\\" is definitely one of her best written. The dialogue flows so smoothly. All of the characters are really fleshed out and interesting, if not likeable.  You want to turn the page and learn more about them!<br /><br />As it stands, this is by far one of my favorites. The romance is intriguing. The main characters are very unique.  The descriptions are very believable. At the end, you will probably say to yourself that you can see how this all happened. It is definitely something where all the pieces fit together. It is also quite different from the style of the other Agatha Christie works, so it stands out just a little bit.
0395389496|5.0|I opted giving books for my bff's kids this years Christmas,toys only last for a short time,clothes,they outgrow them,so what's the best gift that will last for a long,long time?Classic books.Who doesn't love Polar Express right?Poignant,heartwarming,comforting,the best book a kid can ever get.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I could not put this book down. I was captured by the love, emotion, and mystery. I can't wait to begin the next one.
B0080R7Q70|4.0|The Flower Kings always throw me a curve with each release and its another masterpiece. Roine Stolts writing is fantastic.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|Enjoyed from the first listen.  I had not idea he was from American Idol.  Nice mix of tempo and good lyrics.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Love Sanderson's work so picked up this book. It's only a short story but has lots of details and fascinating plot. I love how you get to know the character so quickly and really want her to be able to do her work and escape. Great read!!!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this has got to be the most entertaining  game ever. I was playing it and three hours passed by without me even taking a break lol. fun and you even earn more coins when you are offline!! thank you for this app. :)
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|As a huge fan of Phillip's on AI, I couldn't wait for his debut album and it was definitely worth the wait. With apparently only two months of production, Phillip put together an amazing collection of songs. Love the compositions and lyrics for virtually every song on the album. Contrary to some of the professional reviews, I did not find anything redundant about the music. He's an original. Hope to see him as successful as other true musicians (singer-songwriters) like Dave Matthews,Jack Johnson, and James Tayler... great storytellers with songs that simply make you want to sing along...
1401322786|2.0|This book was like your mother telling you \\"honey eat your veggies, there good for you\\". I know, I know ! Really boring, read it in a day and like other people I was hoping to get a woow out of its meaning but unfortunately I feel like I have watched this story sooo many times in regular tv shows, movies..etc etc.. too bad this was my first Mitch Albom book =(. Ill give the others a try latter, but as for now I gotta kick myself for spending 20 bucks on it. (Bought it at ralphs.)
B0038BBA4I|5.0|There are only a few albums over the years I can say I could listen to over and over again and I'm happy to say I feel this way about this album!  I am not quite sure what it is that entertains me as much as it does.  I love the poetic and storytelling of the songs and how real and how I am able to relate with the songs.  The music sucks me in as well because it is filling and full of character all on it's own.
0143034901|5.0|I randomly picked up this book off a friend's shelf a few weeks ago. How could any reader resist a tale about a mysterious book found in a long-forgotten book sanctuary? Anyway, I'm glad I picked it up!<br /><br />Because this book is written by a Spanish author, the reader must be prepared for rich, slightly morbid descriptions, and some themes that deal with death. If you will be disturbed by these things, this is probably not the book for you. If you like stories that deal with personal stories rather than fast-paced action, you will feel right at home with this book. The beauty of the book is how truly horrific it is, without it being a \\"thriller\\". The horror is less about the grotesque in this story, but rather focuses on the tragic. Zafon does a great job of capturing the intricate details of human interaction. All of the major characters are very well-developed and none of their actions feel forced as the story progresses.<br /><br />I can't talk much about specifics without giving away major plot devices of the story, but suffice it to say that this is a story that will stay with you long after you put the book down.
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|Gotye does it again with a smooth piece of music which goes through to the soul.  Terrific follow up tunes to 'Hearts a Mess'
1451695195|4.0|Simple and to the point. Plus it was confirmation of what I already believe. Explained very well what is normally quite difficult to explain.
0767020308|5.0|I owned it on VHS but I wanted it on DVD! It's perfect! A beautiful rendition of Jane Austen's classic!
B008WCP2PG|2.0|Not enough story line.  Channing Tatum was good dancer though.  He always has been.<br />I have nothing more to say.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|its good for simple stuff but it dosent go into the 10 billions or higher and that's the only reason I dislike it
1449410243|5.0|Very funny. I read it straight through the day it arrived, laughing the entire time. I would highly recommend this book.
0525953728|5.0|A very interesting tale of what it might be like to be a SEAL on the day UBL was killed. The same questions I  had in my head (e.g., What was going through his mind? What was the day like? What did he eat? How did he sleep? How prepared were they? When Choc 1 crashed, what was the state of panic? How much luck was involved?) were answered by the author. Fast, fun, and exciting, this book left me ancing to turn the pages. A great read, hopefully which is more accurate telling of what happened. Thanks.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|As for all the good wife series this is very well done and has been enjoyable date night for my wife and I
B007IXWL2C|5.0|These books are some of the most amazing books I've ever read! I would recommend it to anyone who wants to be literally swept off their feet!
0316227706|5.0|You get some pictures of dogs really goin' for it! They dive in for balls or just messin' around. Got this for my dog-obsessed girlfriend. Some are really cute!
B0058EA3MS|5.0|Another winner by Mike Leigh. For those who love and appreciate the long lost art of indie, character driven cinema.
B004GJDQT8|4.0|I use this mostly on my phone. Does what it's supposed to do in a small area of real estate. I use the website on a tablet usually, but this is a good compliment.
B004UXUUDA|3.0|The book was fairly good.  The movie reinforced the selfishness of the main character.  For the sake of the &#34;story&#34; she ruined more than one life.  Getting to the &#34;truth&#34; is not always the best thing to do...........
B003BVFZ4Q|5.0|This is the only text book I have ever read that had me turning the pages like a novel. Awesome! Not only is Stephen's advice rock solid and excellent, he makes reading it so 'exciting'. This has to be my all-time-best book, ever. And as a full time writer of over 28 years, I learnt heaps from reading this. I remain in awe of this man.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Ive been a Marvel fan, and a superhero fan for all my life. This is the best superhero team up movie ever made.
0446677450|5.0|I love this book. It's not a get rich quick kind of book. It's more for beginers that want to learn how the rich get rich and the middle class stay there. Great book to give as a gift as it's easy to read and in story format.
B000QCS8TW|1.0|I decided not to finish the book. I am all about dark fantasy and science fiction but was unprepared for the death of small children in this book. I have children of my own and found this quit dissatisfying. Therefore I stopped reading the book and moved on to a different author. I am sure the book is quit good if you are into that kind of violence. It was just not for me.
B009H442DG|4.0|I picked this CD up for a good price on Black Friday. It starts out with Baby It's Cold Outside, a song meant for a male/female duet. There are also guest artists on this CD. Barbra Streisand is heard on I'll Be Home for Christmas. Tony Bennett is heard on Winter Wonderland and James Taylor is heard on Deck The Halls. In fact, it sounds like they used the track from James T's Christmas CD for that song. Other artists heard are Kenny G, Chick Corea and Cliff Richard. An original track is featured, titled I Think You Might Like It. Sounds upbeat and catchy.<br /><br />Olivia and John are heard on all the tracks. Of course, Olivia is the better singer, but John sounds decent and manages to stay on key. His voice doesn't sound altered, like on a couple of the Grease tracks. All proceeds made from the CD go to the two singers' charities. Olivia's is her Wellness Center for Cancer research (she's mostly recovered from breast cancer) and John's is a charity named after his son Jett, who had autism and died from a seizure in 2009. He was 16.<br /><br />Overall, a nice CD with nice guest artists.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|I have always loved this story and so enjoyed reading it again.  I only wish we knew more about Heathcliffe.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|It's cumbersome and awkward to use, but it does a pretty good job of cutting bottles. There are better designs out there.
B00005AQE8|5.0|If you haven't got this cd, cassette, vinyl, or mp3 in your music selection you are more than missing out!.  This was Tupac's first release on Death Row Records fresh out of jail in 95.  Instead of going to a therapist to rap about all of his problems and thoughts from prison and the shooting prior to prison, Tupac said he just went to the studio because it was cheaper! haha.  If you didn't know this is the first rap cd to come out as a double album and it sold 9X platinum, 27 tracks on 2 disc of straight fire.  If you're looking for that Westcoast sound that is missing today and that hardcore &#34;gangsta&#34; style of lyrics, then this is what you're looking for.<br /><br />This is my favorite album of all time and has made so many different awards and records.  This album had multiple music videos and was the peak of Tupac's career.  There's a variation of types of songs on the album as well.  It's not just one way all the way through.  Tupac shows you many different sides of himself through his music.  he rides beats to the fullest on tracks like &#34;ambitionz as a ridah&#34; with great lyrics behind it.  Then has great collabs, this album has so many collaborations which i don't like, but they are all good! He has &#34;2 Of Amerikaz Most Wanted&#34; featuring Snoop Dogg, he has K-Ci & JoJo on &#34;How Do U Want It&#34;, he has his click the Outlawz on various tracks.  Nate Dogg, Dru Down, Rappin' 4-Tay, Richie Rich, Dogg Pound, E-40, Danny Boy, Jewell, Michel'le, Redman, Method Man, and others.<br /><br />Tupac has songs that you can play in the club or parties, then he has his mellow tracks like &#34;life goes on&#34; and &#34;heaven ain't hard to find&#34; and &#34;i ain't mad at cha&#34;.  He has songs for the ladies as well as the men, Rolling Stone says this may be the only rap album that you ever need.  You will not be disapointed with this album.  After you get it, make sure you get &#34;Me Against The World&#34; which was the album before &#34;All EyezOn Me&#34; and was released while he was in prison. Then check out Makaveli -The 7 Day Theory, which was released about a month after his death. 5 Star album be sure you add &#34;All Eyez On Me&#34; to your collection of music no matter what type of music you listen to you will enjoy some of the songs of this 27 track album.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|Love the look of this cover.  I use my Kindle all the time and this has held up really well.  Definately worth the money
B005C9YZIW|5.0|Planet Earth in Blu-ray<br /><br />Amazing series that's even better when seen in blu-ray.  Would recommend this for anyone.<br /><br />Just Awesome
B003ODIZL6|4.0|I think that the Oxford ford dictionary was good however you may not choose the words that you desire. So my score is about a 3 1/2 stars.
B005HSL626|2.0|It has a nice colorful display and it moves well.<br /><br />There is no thinking or strategy involved; more appropriate for young children.
B003UESJF6|5.0|The jokes and high energy in the entertaining \\"Megamind\\" come out of a cute conceit: what if every type of boilerplate character you've ever seen in every superhero story all of a sudden questions his or her motivations and role in life?  So here we have a super villain who starts wondering why he's a villain, a villain's henchman wondering why he's content to be a henchman, characters who are supposed to be heroic who decide they just want to slack off for a while or (in a third act tour-de-force) even be villainous.<br /><br />And, oh yes, there's also a cute Lois Lane-type who questions why she always has to be the one being rescued and pined over by the guys in capes.<br /><br />Peppered throughout all this are lots of affectionate pokes at every remaining convention of the superhero genre that the characters I just mentioned weren't already addressing.  Imaginative character designs, good action, and a decent little story round things out.<br /><br />In the end, \\"Megamind\\" is sort of like Pixar's \\"The Incredibles\\" (which I also liked a lot), only tighter and funnier.  It's worth seeking out on disc or via your favorite streaming, download, or cable service.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Too much freezing. Too many errors. Get it together! There should be more items that don't require diamonds to purchase.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|kinda cool<br />I like trying to see how many coins I can get in one sitting.but its fun. just wish I. got coins faster.
B005LAIGWS|3.0|Still have not watched it so I honestly cannot rate the movie, but I loved the first one so I am sure this one will be great.
B00A77II0U|4.0|Fun hidden object game with mini games interspersed.  Beautiful graphics with creepy sound and music. I finished it in about three hours, playing straight through.  It's a good time.
B005FISBV2|5.0|LOVE, LOVE, LOVED IT!!  Huge Dexter fans.  Cannot wait for Season 7 to come out.  Not sure what else to say....
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn is THE BEST!!!! I wait patiently ( really impatiently) every year for his next book . I have read every single one of them & as I approach the end of each book, I take my time because I do not want it to end!! I can hardly wait til his first movie comes out! I recommend Vince Flynn to everyone who likes political thrillers
B009PAETCG|1.0|This seems like it could be a fun app.  I am not stranger to free applications and dealing with advertisements, but this one is very heavy on the ads.  I agree with many of the other comments that you cannot access what you want and are just taken to the app store.  I removed it from my device.  I would not recommend this.
0743277708|5.0|This book is an amazing story and would be a great read for anyone of any age.  The bunnies really come to life!

B004JZBGWI|5.0|it is really helpful!!!!!! I used this for a project and it was way way easier than writing it with a pencil and paper
B009FXIICK|4.0|Good permissions, cute music screens ' a little busy for a retro game, seems stable on my Samsung galaxy SII, exiting takes way too many questions to answer, sb a few times on the back key and you're out - not. Not a star killer. I would not pay for this
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is super fast paced and fun with a lot of goals to complete. and is the most addictive game I have ever played.
B000ICXQXI|4.0|The movie is great! Hitchcock is the master of suspense! And Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates gives a fantastic performance. In terms of the quality of the video, I think it was a little slow. A couple of times the video had to stop and reload. But that may just be a problem on my end; I'm not entirely sure.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Love Pinterest! App is simple & easy to use!<br /><br />App has had trouble opening pin links on Kindle Fire,but I haven't attempted to resolve issue so its not too bad.  Works great on DroidX!
0547564651|5.0|My mom wanted this book because she heard an NPR interview about it. This is a vital book for educators and parents alike. Well worth the time it takes to read and understand it.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|this movie is fun for kids and adults to watch :)  It is one of my favorite kid movies to watch!
B007GE2H3G|4.0|Extraordinary attention to detail. Plenty of action for my ten year old son. Great combination of thrill and plot leaving you to ask for Tintin 2.
B0081BU42O|5.0|For anyone who's read Iain M. Banks previously, read 'The Hydrogen Sonata' as well. For anyone who loves science fiction - again - read this. If you don't love science fiction, well...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved every word that I read in those books.  I could have continued to read forever.  Great!!!<br />Very well written.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|i can use this app with ease. it works great. it keeps track of past calculations so i can go back and forth between my shopping list app and this one without losing any totals. i highly recommend this  app.
0307720950|5.0|Just about to embark on a new design & production business and very apprehensive about the downsides of the internet revolution. This book allowed me to see how positive it can be and suggests how inspiring the world of small makers-global market could be. For me a very appropriate choice to read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is awesome! the only problem have is that after a while of having the game it begins to crash when I try to open the shop which is really annoying.. this is my 3rd time deleting it and re downloading it.. -____-..
B00AA7O22U|5.0|this is a very good movie , is very entretaining and full of action funny and serious at the same time
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I really was enjoying this game, god way to pass the time. It is fun trying to complete some of the side quests, but with the glitches it has, like when trying to browse for merchandice, or read a side quest, game wil boot you. This is my second download of the game, 1st i got caught on a friends town, and couldnt leave. now i cant purchase items,or read quest emails. I really enjoy this game, really considering on deleting it for a 2nd time. Which means having to start all over. Fix tbe glitches, or myself and friends will discontinue playing the game. Would gave a 5star rating,but glitching and freezing up prevents me from doing so.
B009329Y30|5.0|Great movie. Great quilty in the picture.  Worth the buy !!!!! recemind the product to anyone.<br />Got it at a good price too add to it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|it is a great multiple level puzzle game. I like that you can get a checkmark when you solve a puzzle no matter how many times it takes. I like that you know that you solved a puzzle in as few steps as needed when you get a star instead of a checkmark.<br />It can get fustrating when you can not solve it when a few tries or within 30 minutes. When that happens I go to an easier puzzle and redo it or I try flipping my kindle 90 degrees so I see the puzzle differently. It is a fun game that lets you move between puzzles levels.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I was at a stand sitll and had no more books in my que to read.  I just started looking through the NY Times top 100 books and picked this one.  I was afraid to &#34;just pick a book&#34;, but couldn't have been happier.  I finished it quickly and then read Hoover's sequel &#34;Point of Retreat&#34;, which I also loved.  I loved the characters and setting...the booked made me both laugh out loud and made me cry.  I like happy endings, so I was pleased with how she ended the whole book.
B001NLL8LA|3.0|how many dead bodies are you allowed to leave laying around New York before you go to jail? There is also a direct put down on US auto manufacturers when he says &#34;domestic pieces of shit&#34;. This is after the last book badmouthed hunting. Whats next, badmouthing people that actually work for a living?
B00846REIS|4.0|The relationship / obsession between Gideon and Eva creates a very dramatic read.  No, it's probably not healthy, and they are both dealing with a great deal of personal baggage, but the reader finds herself totally caught up in the love story.  It was extremely hard to put down, and I find myself thinking about their relationship long after the book is over.  In my opinion, much better written than 50 Shades, and the heroine is much more likable, too.
B005XBKXV2|5.0|we got this to prepare for the musical and the kids so far have watched it three times!  not only will they be prepared for the musical, but this will be a nice movie for the family to watch time and time again!
0345803485|1.0|This woman must have an uncle who owns a publishing company to get this poorly written juvenile porn published.  If this is what sells these days, then we truly have become an idiocracy!
0547884591|5.0|I like the affirmations that you can hyper learn.  And this book identifies a few key systems that make hyper-learning more manageable and effective.  Good job Tim.  Keep it up.
B00913DPW2|5.0|Adventure, puzzle and quests are part of game. Graphics were good, colorful, easy to get around in the game. Loved it!
B003O86FMW|4.0|When I first started reading this book I was a bit disappointed in it. It seemed like they were just going to rehash the events of the first book. The first few chapters were pretty dull but once I got about 20% in the story started to take off. I never expected the story to go in the direction that it did. From that point on it became in to a page turner and sucked me right in. If you've read the first book you must, absolutely must, finish the series. You will not be disappointed.
B009LK6JS2|1.0|As other reviewers have stated, the app is kinda cool but you have to work some magic to not get the whole screen to flip upside down.  The only way I was able to do it was to hit the &#34;lock&#34; button under settings before loading the game.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I didn't know what to expect from the Hunger Games. I knew it was written for younger readers so it didn't really interest me. Then it came up on Amazon for the Kindle for $1.99 one day so I grabbed it. I am so glad I did. The story is gripping and I still cannot believe this was written for young readers. As an adult I was drawn in by the characters and twists in the story. It made me buy the rest of the series as soon as I was done. If you do read this book make sure you finish the series. You will not be disappointed.
B009CG2YDE|5.0|This is a great game. It reminds me a lot of Galaga from the 80s. I highly recommend it to any arcade players out there.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|angry birds star wars is so much fun the gameplay has regular angry birds gravity and angry birds space gravity the birds have guns lightsabers and the force plz make  updates so I can have more fun<br />Ps. r2d2 and cp30 r soo cool
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This is a great movie and there is not much more to say about it. Only issue i have is why would i need the regualr dvd version if i have blu ray and 3D. Nice offer of the music you get with this as well.
B001N3GUIE|5.0|Great classic science fiction movie, one of my favorites. remastered with great color and clarity. A must have for serious collectors.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Its good for a few minutes of fun a day. Sounds like a slot machine. I wouldn't pay for it though
B0068LYEHA|5.0|Caitlin Moran is witty, clever, British, and a feminist. I have probably annoyed everyone by quoting different pages in this book with a terrible accent, but I do not care, as I am a feminist, too. A must read and very surprising.
B006TLFIAQ|3.0|Might be a good idea to wait until the item ships before sending  a review request LOL. Please forward to someone who can make the probramming changes.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|We saw this show on TV and we were so glad to find this online to be able to watch without commercials.  We have watched it over and over.  What a great and talented group of muscians!

B003Y5H556|5.0|Great visual effects, wonderful cast, phenomenal direction with the storyline... my favorite version of Red ever! Blu-ray was a definite must with this one!!!
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|This is possibly the best book yet! Rick Riordan`s writing has really improved.I sure hope Rick never stops!Good job Rick!
B005RUUUAI|5.0|This show sucks you in like you'd never believe. I'm not even usually a zombie movie/show kind of girl, but this has such incredible makeup and effects that you'd think it is a feature length film every episode! The story line is well thought out and the acting is great!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved this book!! Read it in 2 nights!! Very captivating and thrilling!! Cant wait to read the other books in the series!!
B005LAIH4A|4.0|My three-year-old wanted to watch this, and my husband loved the book as a kid so I went ahead and made a big deal of sitting down for a family movie night. It turned out to be really cute. It isn't one of my favorite kid movies of all time, but it is definitely worth watching!
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|I had seen the movie before I started reading this book. What I appreciate is the little things that the director of the screenplay took care of to show. Back to the book, even though I know the story I am hooked onto it. It is such well return, I can almost feel as if the whole plot is unfolding in front of me in real life. Do yourself a favour, read the book before you see the screenplay..
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|My mom was very pleased with her b*day present. Although my dad is not that happy since he has to listen to it 24/7!
B0074VTHKM|5.0|As long as Grisham sticks to legal issues in his books they are great reading.  This one is no exception.  I prefer Grisham books to any other current author.
B005HSL626|4.0|This is a fun game to play in your spare time. Very fun and quick. Hopefully will enjoy it as much as I do!

B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I really enjoy playing this game. Even though sometimes you might have trouble INJURING the piggies. This game is very fun to play, hope u enjoy it.
B00936A0RU|4.0|I loved this movie.  It  is quite different from most movies done about this era.  It is not Boardwalk Empire.  The fact that it was based on real lives made it a hit.  The actors were all excellent, and it did not disappoint me.  This is a movie I will watch again and share with my friends
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Your familiar Facebook in a compact APP so you do not have to use a Web Browser interface. It's free, so the price cannot be beaten. If you are not able to be away from Facebook just because you are away from your computer, this is the right product for you.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Great movie, especially for fans of the books. Hits the characters spot on as you'd expect. Watch it now, go!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have seen many negative reviews about this book and they are based I believe on people who are looking for  a detailed version of what is to come, or they are looking for their religion reflected in Alexander's experience and when they get neither they dismiss the book off hand which to me is a shame because I feel they missed the point of the book, which was to say that the other side is real! Alexander presents his experience in a way that shows without a doubt that the brain cannot be responsible for \\"imagining\\" the whole thing. This is the point Alexander is trying to make a case for, that the most highly prized attack of skeptics which is that most NDE's are explained away as a dying brain's dream of sorts; is wrong. With Alexander's experience and his expertise we can see that the part of the brain responsible for this \\"dream\\" was non functioning. This is the main point Alexander is trying to get across he is trying to show the reader that it is true by use of science that there is something more beyond life. His experience over there I feel is comforting just knowing we are loved unconditionally, but the rest of the details that people are yearning for are inconsequential because I truly believe that your experience is as unique as you are, so therefore his experience is meaningless to me in so far as the details are concerned. There is a God and that God loves us and we go on beyond this pitifully short existence we call life, that much info I can live and be happy with. Kudos to Doctor Alexander and his very well written book. If you love stories of NDE's then this is a very important book to read.
B0026NWBY2|5.0|great cd great service will recomend it to all my friends happy with the whole prosess and will buy again
B00979CS50|5.0|There's a certain magic to Neil and Crazy Horse that defies description. OK, maybe timeless. No, that doesn't quite do it either.
0399157565|1.0|I have read all of Cornwell's Scarpetta books and after finishing this one thought it might be the last. What happened? The book rambles, makes no sense. The plot is all over the place and the characters are so thin I don't even know why some of them are in there. Kay's \\"musings\\" sound like she is having a breakdown. Her relationships are all paranoid and have little in common with their earlier depictions. The ending was just weird and the murderer...whaaat??? Who, what, why???? Nonsensical.
B0092C2X7U|3.0|The game is addicting, for sure. After getting used to the simple back flip, it becomes more challenging as you are given different scenes and abilities. What is frustrating is after you die (which can become hilarious) you have to go all the way back to the start of the level. UGH.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book. I can't wait to read the next one. Lots of suspense. I had no clue how this end.
B009IQ0TGM|4.0|I had not heard of Ellie but she was featured on a DJ track and I really enjoyed her voice. Though not quite uptempo dance it is well done, with good production and thoughtful lyrics.

B000FA5SMK|5.0|AN EXCITING ADVENTURE AROUND THE ISLANDS NEAR LONG ISLAND.  MADE ME WANT TO RESEARCH FURTHER IF THERE REALLY WAS A GOVERNMENT INSTALLATION THERE.  I LIKED THE MAIN CHARACTER  AND VISUALIZED DENNIS __________ (CAN'T THINK OF HIS LAST NAME) PLAYING THE PART IN A MOVIE.  A REAL PAGE-TURNER----I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN.
0061474355|5.0|From the opening page to the last sentence, Sabriel pulls you in and refuses to let go.<br /><br />The background of the Old Kingdom is explained flawlessly and completely without getting bogged down in paragraphs of history. Details are explained by Nix quickly enough to keep you going, but slowly enough to keep you wanting more.<br /><br />Characters are not clich&eacute; or flat and manage to be ultimately human in their struggles and flaws. Their grand adventure is well paced through the novel and, despite increasing elements of the fantastic, their narrative and nature become more believable as the story goes on.<br /><br />Breaking away from traditional fantasy world models, Nix creates a mythology that is brand new and utterly exciting.
B005LAII1C|5.0|Let me start by saying I am a bit biased, I enjoy Seth MacFarlane's work whether it be in Family Guy, American Dad or one of his other side projects.  I'm three years older than Seth so we pretty much grew up with the same pop culture references, including a love for things like Star Wars, Star Trek and the 1980 movie Flash Gordon starring Sam Jones, who plays a prominent role here in Ted.  I can tell you right up front if you don't like Family Guy and that type of humor you can probably skip the rest of this review and the movie because you're probably not going to like them either.<br /><br />Ted is a pretty simple story of a young boy named John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) who doesn't have many friends that wishes his teddy bear could come to life and be his life long companion and through the magic of some excellent computer generated graphics that is exactly what happens.  I thought the way they handled the bear coming to life was perfect, it wasn't transformed into a living and breathing bear with flesh, bones and blood, Ted remained the same furry toy stuffed with plush stuffing but he had the ability to talk, walk, eat and drink.<br /><br />There are a couple of story lines going on here, the main one is that John's girlfriend Lori, played by Mila Kunis, believes that it's time for John to give up his friendship with the bear and \\"grow up\\" to focus on their relationship.  There's no question that the things Ted and John do together prompted Lori's concern, but it is not because Ted is a stuffed bear as much as it is that Ted is a foul mouthed, weed smoking, alcohol swilling guy without a job.  I think that was a big part of what made this movie work, after a while you started looking at Ted less as a stuffed bear and more just as a living, breathing character.<br /><br />Those that want to dismiss this movie as simply a bunch of crude fart jokes are really not telling you the full story.  Sure, some of that humor exist here, this IS Seth MacFarlane after all, but this movie has a lot of heart.  I mean come on, how can the relationship of a guy and his teddy bear not have at least a little bit of heart?<br /><br />I have to admit I really dug seeing Sam Jones (aka Flash Gordon) in the movie.  He plays an amped up and a bit crazy persona of himself that was just a lot of fun to watch.  If you didn't grow up in the 80's and you weren't a fan of Flash Gordon your mileage may vary here, but I thought it was a blast to see Jones back on the big screen with the Flash character in tow.<br /><br />Overall, if you like Family Guy you'll probably like this movie.  If you like Family Guy AND you had a particular stuffed toy in your childhood that you had an attachment to you're probably going to LOVE this movie as long as you don't mind your childhood plush friend dry humping a cashier in the back of a grocery store.  Yeah, it's not high art but I thought it was a whole lot of fun.  I'll give it a thumbs up!t this movie has a lot of heart.

B007CEWR62|5.0|I have bought almost all Secret Garden's albums. This one is just as good as the others. I love their music. Nice for meditating, listening to when I try to go to sleep, or just sitting quiet. Highly recommend this group & this album.
B001H1SVO8|5.0|I've always meant to buy this movie, I couldn't resist this price. Great addition to my library. And it's Blu-Ray!!

0547884591|5.0|As a physician I am a skeptic about most people's definition of \\"science.\\"  That said, I am proof of the genius of Tim Ferriss.  Through his two previous books I have lost over 70#, learned sign language, work less hours while making more money, started (and understand) my own website, even published my own book on Amazon last week.  I like to think of myself as \\"the 4 hour mom\\" thus I thought another book would be beyond his expertise and fail by comparison.  I have never been so happy to be wrong!<br /><br />This book is absolutely amazing.  From the glorious pictures to the \\"choose your own adventure\\" pace, it is a gem for anybody.  Everybody can learn more efficiently.  Giving this book is like giving the gift of time AND talent.  Thus, I purchased copies for gifts for teachers, bus drivers, co-workers, hair stylist. . .everybody!  This is the first time I have ever bought one gift for all of those on my list.  For those you want to do a little extra for, the book along with a gift certificate to an ancillary company like evernote or CLEAR would be a fantastic choice.<br /><br />I realize this may sound over the top, but the books of Tim Ferris have truly changed my life.  I am being transported to an even higher plane with The 4-Hour Chef!  THANK YOU, Mr. Ferriss!
B007URVZJ6|4.0|wish I had this before I submitted my kindle book.  I will use it before I submit my next one.
B00973DDN2|5.0|great album. very relative to the time of my life right now. ive missed the killers too long since the last album. good stuff
B009S33I68|5.0|What I like is that the parts Moore wrote -- you could see into his soul. He insisted on going back to check for MIA. It haunted him (still seemed to haunt him today) did he miss count, did he make a mistake, was someone lost? Yes, he told a story but you could feel the anguish he felt.<br /><br />The description of Moore's visits to family of he dead soldiers was gut wrenching.<br /><br />I like how it was told from two sides (the soldiers with some stories of their families). I like how the book was raw/gritty with first hand about the fighting and raw \\"hate\\" for the enemy. But when the battles was over, years later, the respect shown to the commanders on the Vietnamese side was clear.<br /><br />As a solider he just watched as politics stripped their ability train/fight and it must have been brutal to do his job knowing their was always one hand tied behind his back.
0345803507|5.0|The book was the best! Cheap and mailed on time! I looked at other places to buy this book and this was the cheapest!
B005LAIHZE|5.0|Good story line, Shows what a good Horror Movie can be when real people in history could be used to tell a story. Benjamin Walker does a good job playing Lincoln and the rest of the cast does a fine job playing their roles. I would highly recommend anybody who likes Horror and History to pick this up.
0345803485|5.0|awesome book, very cheap got it in a timley fashion didn't have to wait long would recommend buying books from hehrefor those that like to read
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Loved this BOOK!! read it in 1 day and it is a page turner, can't (don't) want to wait till the next book comes out in a year. Good for multiple reading levels, and keeps you drawn in.
1423136802|5.0|Couldn't be happier with these books. Fun to read and perfect gift for a preteen. I even bought these books on my kindle.
B007MJ9LA2|5.0|This is an excellent set of songs.  I have every Santana album and every album Santana has guest appeared on and this CD does not disappoint.  Some of Santana's recent work has not lived up to his apex standards however with Shape Shifter his music has returned to top of form.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I read these right before the movie came out. The books are a million times better. Read these books now!
B000WCBMA8|5.0|sorry I got this twice maybe I went to the Mall for it first thing weird my stereo was like eating it physically then it as I did what move i knew to stop all that and tighten up the stereo I couldn't find where it got temporarily set it was a big chomp this time the stereo it hadn't done it before just the triple thing tray needed a shove to get back all the time kinda anyway most all I think, still it is trashed anyway
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Quite a fun read. I was always thinking about this book even when I wasn't reading. I wish there was a bit more character development. But I really enjoyed it!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I enjoy this app.  I use it for relaxation and with earphones for concentration.  The sounds are soothing and the concentration wave helps me to focus.
B004JN1CW4|4.0|It was fun. It Answered a lot if questions from the last books. Liked the first book the most though.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Great story, well written and very believable. Ken Follet is becoming one of my favorite authors. I would recommend it to anyone.

B0052RDHTM|4.0|Well written and very plausible type war story. Ken Follet is becoming one of my favorite authors. Recommended to anyone interested in the subject with a seemingly historical flavor.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is the funniest Christmas movie ever made.  No matter how many times I have seen it, it's not enough.<br /><br />The scene with the squirrel still gets me laughing until it hurts.  I even put a fake squirrel in my Christmas tree every year because of this movie.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|It was a good story, but the plot and the ending ingratiates the reader with a perfect outcome.  Out of character for John Grisham ... expecting a curve at the end!
B003L77FYS|5.0|This is a great addition to any DVD collection. I would highly recommend this DVD for anyone who likes this TV series.

B008YJFF2M|4.0|This is a pretty good cd.  It sounds great.  Some songs I had never heard before.  It was nice to know who actually sanged the tunes from the movies.  You Only Live Twice, Goldfinger, Thunderball, Live And Let Die, and Licence To Kill are my favorites.<br /><br />It brings back so many memories of most of the Bond movies I enjoy. I own almost all of the Bond movies.  Many of the one's with Roger Moore are my least favorite.  My favorite with him in it is, \\"Live and Let Die\\", which I own.  I may one day finish my collection by purchasing the rest of his movies.<br /><br />This cd is fun to own, and I will enjoy it always.

0345803485|1.0|Fifty Shades of Grey might have been interesting for couple chapters, but then everything kept repeating and repeating and repeating .....<br /><br />I find Ana not only just annoying but also she's not that bright either, with extremely low self esteem. Does a man have to decide for a girl on the birth control method?  Injection with all the dangerous side effect?  Dose he have to criticize her clothing?  Does he have to decide on choice of friends, type of work, wearing or not wearing underwear,  what to eat, drink, listen, do , dress........ all happening in 3 weeks of relationship? Impose meeting parents so early on.  Wow, I am truly amazed that how some people interpret this suffocating behavior as love.<br /><br />This book is obviously for bored housewives when they have very limited sexual experience in their life (probably married the high school boy friend) or young girls waiting for prince charming to sweep them off their feet.  There are far better erotic novels with an actual interesting plot, such as \\"Harold Robbins\\" books, where you can actually get really entertained and enjoy the sex scenes as well.<br />As a person with English as my second language, I also find the book at extremely low literary value, even with my limited language skills.  Yes, once in a while there is a big word thrown in the book, but is that enough?
B002ZG98VE|5.0|This is a great addition to any DVD collection. I would highly recommend this DVD for anyone who likes this movie.
B009NPM5Y2|2.0|It's a musical,  what else needs to be said  Someone should have told Tom Cruise he was in a movie  lol

B0098VYKSA|4.0|Lot of good special effects and beautiful women,  what else can a guy ask for in a movie?  Will watch it again when I don't have to rent it.

B003S5K8GK|5.0|I love the trio combo of SRK, Kajol and KJ and they sure did not disappoint. Has all the ingredients, issue, chemistry, and very very emotionally moving. Very well-acted. Plus I loved that I could buy it through streaming... who needs discs that get scratched when there's virtual presence for watching anywhere???
B004LWZW42|5.0|This is a great addition to any DVD collection. I would highly recommend this DVD for anyone who likes this movie.
B004SUWR2C|1.0|Not even worth the cheap price of 99 cents.  Extra downloads - weird card play - not fun - would like to have my money back - will delete.
B003L77G8I|5.0|This is a great addition to any DVD collection. I would highly recommend this DVD for anyone who likes this TV series.
0060005696|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It makes clear how often mankind's fear of removing options actually creates less joy and satisfaction than doing quite the opposite. I recommend it. Thought provoking for business owners, singles and generally anyone who has a hard time or fears making decisions.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|This is a great addition to any DVD collection. I would highly recommend this DVD for anyone who likes this TV series.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I fell in love with this book and couldn't put it down!  This is a must read for anyone regardless of gender or age.
B005G4TJI4|1.0|Annoying when you buy a movie mostly because of the digital copy and it has expired months before.<br />This is a major DISAPPOINTMENT!!
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Good movie, introduces the start of the Alien creature in a logical form. As was in Star Wars, the beginning came last and helped fill in some of the gaps to the series.
B0063IH60K|4.0|enjoy the game.  ads get anmoying but easy to an skip.  good for a free game you can play whenever.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Good story and theme for the movie, the graphics are great and I liked the way the story was presented. Good family film.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Sad it had to end. I recommend to all. A must read. You'll laugh and cry all the way through.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Film depicts all the Avengers at once is does a very good job at it. The characters are believable and the story is rich with graphics and action for the entire family. Hulk character was well done compared to the other movies with this character in them. Over all a solid performance by all.
B009FXIICK|5.0|I enjoyed this game.  I'm a really big fan of puzzles and this will certainly keep me busy for quite some time. I certainly recommend.
B004EKCNMA|5.0|I like the way this film depicts the meaning of Christmas ans is not afraid to leave the spirit of Christianity in the movie rather than leave it out as many of today's movies do. Jim Carrey does an excellent performance and I would recommend this film for all families to consider during not only the holidays but as a way to live throughout the entire year.
B0083SBMBM|3.0|good action flick, but the special effects seem repetitive to me after you see a couple of these movies.  it reminded me of the same effects used in superman movies many years ago.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Book 2 of Fifty Shades of Grey was fantastic but I have to say book 2 Reflected in You of this series might be a little bit better.  I loved that there was great scenes along with a fantastic storyline.....cannot wait for book 3.
B00005TQKQ|5.0|call me old fashioned, but i still use my V8 (tape) video camera, and it needed a cleaning bad.  this product did the trick, and in about 1 minute old betsy was back up and running.
0307463745|5.0|I own a small business and have been adhering to many of the great advices in this book. I have improved efficiency, decreased complication and unnecessary stress over competition. I keep a tight focus on what's best for my business without trying to be everything to all clients.<br /><br />So much great material I have to read it again every few months.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|this is my 2nd pair of sony mdr7506 headphones.  i am a musician and use them primarily for recording and mixing in the wee hours of the night so as not to disturb others in the household.  very well balanced, so it is possible to get a great mix of highs, mid, and bass levels.  i got my first pair about 12 years ago, and they are still working fine, too.
1592802974|5.0|I really liked this series of books.  It is interviews with succesful trades on their successes and failures as traders and their basic philosophies to trading.  I definitely recommend reading if you are into trading.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like this app the puzzles are really cool and unique and I like the &quot;feel&quot; of drawing the lines. It's a really clever game.
B000002GWN|5.0|For Joni Mitchell fans, do I have to even nod in the affirmative that this is an Essential addition to the studoo albums? Putting it simply: some of the live versions are, believe it or not, stronger than the well known versions: cases in point: CACTUS TREE, ALL I WANT, COLD BLUE STEEL AND SWEET FIRE; on and on.<br /><br />Her voice has dropped maybe a half octave - experts correct me if I'm wrong - so something like COLD BLUE STEEL... and CASE OF YOU are really.....steamy. Not to mention that the rock and roll road, by the mid-70s, only strengthened her singing, dynamic range and resonant tremolo, more than intact.<br /><br />Would have loved a few more in-concert photos but...I'm still recovering from the \\"new\\" CACTUS TREE. From that JM album nobody talks about. Well, hopefully they did/do after auditioning this set.<br /><br />Joni!!!!!
0553062182|5.0|This book was thy key to my life that I needed in order to truly understand myself and thus how to better care for myself as we'll! I love this book!!
B005V4FJC4|5.0|It's just the best. Takes a twist on classic Christmas tunes, and lodges them even further into the cockles of your heart. That shower scene in elf? Just the beginning...
B009VB97EY|4.0|I thought Channing Tatum was great.  It was definitely my guilty pleasure movie.  In between all the dancing and butt shots, it had a decent story.  Well worth it just to watch him dance.
B000002LSV|5.0|I really like ZZ top, they are great when you are long distance driving.  Keeps you awake even if it does give you a headache.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved the story...although the physical intimacy was a bit over the top...definately a young persons sport...but it was entertaining.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|for a bean counter like me I enjoy a simple easy to use calculator that is problem free. this app fit the bill.
B0034G4P94|5.0|This is a truely great movie. It has a great story line and a really good ending! I would reccomend this movie.
886293713X|5.0|This is exactly what I look for in a planner. It's small enough to fit in my purse. Plenty of room on each day to write a few notes or events. Lots of space on the right side for additional details, phone numbers, addresses, etc. I also use the note section in the back quite a bit. The leather is durable, although it has gotten pretty dirty over the course of the year (adding character, I don't mind!)<br />I have already purchased my 2013 moleskine. Definitely recommend.
0446310786|5.0|Excellent classic book! One of my favorite classics. It is such a great story all around and I would reccomend anyone to read it.
B005K2YRVG|4.0|Perfect for traveling. I feel pretty safe throwing my kindle (which is the 6 inch e ink display model) in this sleeve then popping it in my purse or another bag. Good padding, my kindle fits nice and snug. My only complaint is how the sleeve is a little bulky. When you close the little flap over, it puff out quite a bit.<br />Overall, I'm happy. I'd recommend to someone looking for a basic sleeve that will protect from bumps and minor falls.
0452281881|4.0|Still as current as twelve years ago! Hilarious! A great book for people in or entering to the world of advertising and agencies.
1451695195|5.0|I first saw the author on talks shows and was so interested I bought the book immediately.  It was a wonderful book that made you believe and left you feeling inspired to live a better life.
B007L7JY3Y|5.0|great for my mini projects and for my long term goals!  love that I can create my own tabs and divide into folders and subfolders to my hearts content!
B0096C7QF0|4.0|Vey good. Saw the concert on TV it was great.. Highly recommend this to any Joe or John Hiat fan
0375507256|5.0|What a great epic stretch of story-telling. Loved the way the stories connected, and the stories in the different time periods. But more, the characters came alive and the writing was just so good!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I have it on my Droid phone, and naturally wanted to download it to my Kindle HD.  Its even easier to play!
B008XG1X18|4.0|this app is very addicting only reason for not getting all 5 stars is sometimes the app doesn't open on the first try
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Nice tone, very agreeable and well-drawn characters, a bit of suspense and insight into the workings of Google.  Ending was, well . . . disappointing, but this is an exceptionally nice read.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|I was a little disapointed that it was not free but its ok because this game is very fun and addictive! And having all the extras is just a plus! Great job and totally worth the game for ur buck!!!!
0061564893|1.0|Pseudo-history has never been my thing, and I'm upset that I bought this book before understanding its true nature.  Having become increasingly uneasy with the flimsy \\"evidence\\" presented to back up his theory while reading, I was devastated to find out Mr Menzies is essentially a liar (please see other reviews for more details).  Sad to know I contributed to this by purchasing a copy... even more sad to see that the barriers for what counts as 'history' to the pub have been lowered substantially.
B000GWE44U|4.0|This movie is great it made me jump and sit at the edge of my seat. Jack Nicholson is at his scary best.
B000KX0IOA|5.0|I think everyone has been touched by Gandhi in one way or another...whether they know it or not.  Ben Kingsly is outstanding as Gandhi.  If you want to be inspired, this is a movie to watch.  This is one of those films that is a must in anyone's collection.
B009A882D0|5.0|All CCR's best plus some of their more obscure stuff. You can't go wrong with this one! Definitely worth it.
1451695187|4.0|I enjoyed the book though the writing left much to be desired. As for &#34;proof&#34; of heaven, there is no &#34;there&#34; there as the saying goes. Nevertheless, it was an interesting read and I'm glad Dr. Alexander made it through his difficult circumstances.
B007WFTFG6|4.0|My 4 year old loves this. I think it's a bit disorganized, but it's free and there are a lot of different pictures to color. The pictures are organized into 4 categories, but there's loads of pictures to color in each category and they look different from one another. If you have a kid that just loves to color this will be great for them. But if your kid likes organization maybe give this a miss.
B00133KFGW|4.0|This is a sweet and uplifting little movie that lets you just sit back and enjoy.  It won't change the world but it might change your mood. Enjoy.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My husband and our 4 year old both love playing this game. He frees up levels so she has more levels to choose from.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Great movie to watch with your mom. We tend to take our moms for granted at times. I will definitely buy it. Very soon so that my future kids can enjoy it also
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Intel offers overclocking insurance for 20-30 dollars. If you break your cpu, they will send you a replacement one at no added cost. That should give you an idea of how confident they are in their product. Mine has been running at 4.3 Ghz for a month without any issues.
B001FB0WBK|5.0|i discovered this specific show through a friend.<br />Tommy Emmanuel is really here at the top of his art. And the most wonderful part of it, upon the impression that it is &#34;all easy&#34;, it is the immense pleasure of playing. he enjoys it and communicates it in a perfect fashion.
0743298039|1.0|I COURAGEOUSLY TRIED TO GET THROUGH THIS BOOK, BUT THERE WASN'T ANYTHING IN MY OPINION TO SAVE IT.  FROM THE FIRST LAUNCHING INTO THE STORY OF CHARLIE AND ISABELLE I FOUND MYSELF SAYING TO MYSELF (ALWAYS A BAD SIGN), \\"YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING\\".  THE PLOT WAS TOTALLY UNBELIEVABLE AND I WAS NOT ABLE TO CONNECT WITH ANY OF THE CHARACTERS ON ANY LEVEL. MAYBE THIS IS THE CORRECT GENDRE THESE DAYS AND RUNNING WIRES THROUGH YOUR ARMS AND EXCISING NAMES INTO YOUR FLESH AND BONES MIGHT BE CURRENTLY IN VOGUE...BUT THANK GOD IT IS NOT FOR ME.  AND THEN TO HAVE THE UTTER GALL TO BRING PEOPLE INTO THIS NOVEL OF THE LIKES OF JANE AUSTIN, CHARLOTTE BRONTE AND OTHERS AS COMPARISION OF THIS WRITING TO THEIRS...IMPOSSIBLE.  I'M GOING TO HAVE TO SEND THIS ONE BACK TO AMAZON.  IT IS PROBABLY THE WORST BOOK I HAVE READ ALL YEAR...AND THAT COVERS A LOT OF BOOKS.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|this game is fun but some of the mini games a hard but its a great time waster:) get it
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book is a testament to people can look and act great on the outside but be snakes on the inside.  By the end of the book I detested both main characters.
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|Christina Aguilera  is my favorite artist.  This CD is different and well appreciated.  Circles is the song to all the haters.
B0027MJU00|3.0|This is so depressing.  I'm only reading it on my best days.  Could there be any source of redemption or just plain goodness in anyone here?
B0011EU0NG|5.0|One of the movies I watched as a child. The songs are really catchy and keeps the kids attention. Love the movie
B005ISQEF4|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies. Had to buy it. I could watch it over and over again and have ha
B0085RQLXK|2.0|Look - maybe it's time! Every band has their day. Aerosmith has nothing to hang their head about. They have been a permeating musical force for over forty-years and that's not too shabby in my opinion. This new offering is not the hype of 'return to form' the band members said it would be. It is a contemporary offering that reeks of corporate hits and sounds of the modern music scene which isn't much to shout about. The music industry is in trouble and if established bands like Aerosmith can't see past its drivel then, 'The Bad Boys from Boston' should just hang-it-up and call it a day. This isn't what we thought it would be nor is it what the band promised. The `return to form' should never include a duet with Carrie Underwood. She has her dimension and Aerosmith has theirs; the two don't mix well. \\"Kick Her Ass to the Curb\\", should be the sorry song they write for recording \\"Can't Stop Lovin' You\\".<br /><br />Sorry boys, this Dimension really hurts!
0345803485|4.0|Okay, so... Just to be clear, I'm 19 years old and currently in college. With that being said, I am loving this book! I think because I can somewhat relate to Anastasia. I stayed up all night to read the book because I just did not want to put it down. I thought it was extremely hot... And while I was reading it, I giggled and gasped and said \\"oh my gosh\\" so many times. Like I said, I'm really enjoying it, but there are parts that are annoying. Like the repetitive words... need to STOP.<br /><br />But all in all, I want to meet a Christian Grey! He sounds very interesting.<br /><br />Can't wait to finish the book!
B008GVD6D8|4.0|if you enjoyed reading 50 shades you will enjoy this.  It is has a very detailed story line. Not sure if i would read it again
B000T433CO|4.0|I nice comedy-romance centered around a US-UK vacation house-swap.  The side-story with Eli Wallach as an aging former hollywood writer really added to the film.  This a favorite that can be watched more than once.
B008BM9L72|5.0|Even though i loved this book i was dissapointed with the ending.  If you enjoy reading all about sex this is a great novel to read.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book really got my attention. I couldn't put it down. However, II didn't like the ending. I don't know what I was expecting but it didn't work for me.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Since the first of these epic stories starting with the Pillars of the Earth each book has maintained the thrill and excitment of the history  of our lives and ancestors..
B005XTLAQQ|5.0|Esta muñeca es preciosa....a las niñas les parece bella....y a las adultas nos fascina, jejejejej...ampliamente recomendada y el envío excelente
B008QE9XD2|5.0|JOHNNY DEPP IS ALWAYS ENTERTAINING NO MATTER WHAT TYPE OF FILM HE WORKS ON BUT SINCE I  WAS ALSO AN ADOLESCENT FAN OF BARNABUS COLLINS I ENJOYED THIS FILM TREMENDOUSLY.
B004L3AR0K|4.0|This is soft porn with talented actors. Thats a new one. She is a beautiful women sort of makes you want to find a girl with her disorder when your in your twenties.
B007SY3CEW|4.0|I like this app, although it is hard to figure out exactly at what time you are supposed to hit the keys when the stars fall to make a &#34;perfect&#34; hit.  I get a lot of &#34;good&#34; hits, but can't figure out at what point the star reaches the red bar you are actually supposed to hit it.
B000PY52EU|5.0|She is not only a beleivable actress she is attractive and talented. Sam is always great. I liked the film.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I really started liking this game once I figured out you can tap the screen size to change the number of dots to connect and make it harder.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|'Moonrise Kingdom' has the same look and feel as Wes Anderson other films; festive colors, hilarious dialogue, and brilliant actors come together to create a moving story. A perfect movie for people of all ages, plenty of laughs and a great story about love, personal discovery, and exploration. Highly recommended.
B007RKPO84|4.0|Kreator once again unleash another monster album on us.  At first I thought I heard significant redundancy from the prior album, but subsequent listens prove different.  Yes, they are still thrashing it up well with roaring speedy riffs galore however, this is also the most melodic album they've ever done. Contrary to the naysayers saying they've gone soft, I have nothing to complain about as the end result sounds fantastic. Some lyrical content as well as a couple chorus's are a tad cringe worthy but hey, Kreator was never the Shakespeare of metal anyway.  However, there are a couple songs here that do rank in the upper echelon of the bands history, such as From Flood Into Fire (my favorite song here) as well as Your Heaven, My Hell.  Your Heaven, My Hell contains some wicked lead guitar work from Sami as well as that added aggression to push the song to the next level.  The Few, The Proud, The Broken oozes with emotion while still hitting the listener upside the head.  In the end this album ranks only slightly below Hordes of Chaos, so if you enjoyed that album this should be a no-brainer for your ears.
B00913DPW2|2.0|This game was to difficult for an average player. Not enough reward for the work.In order to figure out several of the tasks you had to go to the website.
B0086700CM|4.0|my two girls love this game and play it all the time...so glad i downloaded it for them...tons of fun!
B007EE4XKI|5.0|I'm still reading it but it's brilliant! Hard to put down! David, you're a genius! Where do you get this stuff from..???
B0071MQBX0|5.0|This was better than the movie!<br />I would highly recommend this to anyone wanting to get the best adaptation of the musical.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This is my first time reading William Landay and I was not disappointed. I was lost in the story not sure how I wanted it to end. I look forward to reading more or his work.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|At first I was reluctant to use this app because of the privacy concerns raised by several reviewers. I painstakingly read the whole privacy policy and couldn't find anything that said they would use or not keep private my data. Those reviewers were misunderstood, Evernote said that if you post to THEIR WEBSITE or a public folder in Evernote's program will be public, not your private data from the program, heres a little bit:<br /><br />\\"Certain portions of the Evernote web sites and services are open to any online viewer, such as user notebooks designated as \\"public,\\" and our user forum. Any information that you post in these locations can be read, collected and used by anyone, and could enable others to send you unsolicited messages. Evernote enables you to determine whether or not to post personal or otherwise sensitive information to publicly accessible areas of our site, and so you should carefully consider how you use the services.\\"<br /><br />And they just sent a notice of the updated privacy policy to come in 2013 and highlighted these points:<br />  Your data is Yours<br />  Your data is Protected<br />  Your data is Portable<br /><br />I haven't read it yet, but highly doubt they'd mislead us into thinking it was private and then bury some line about it not really bring private deep in the policy.<br /><br />I am spending all this time writing this because I actually read the whole policy and was upset I waited so long to use this great service after trusting the reviewers who thought Evernote can basically just hop in your private files and do what they wish. Evernote lets you save notes, webpages, scans, and keeps it all organized and accessable. And it seems to keep getting better, there is now an Food edition, (wonderful news for a foodie like me) where you can keep track of foods you eat and love, I can't wait to try it.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|there is no words to describe how good the suspense and action is in this must see must buy. still have not seen part 2 but will.
0345803507|5.0|I chose this rating because the book was good...<br />I loved the romance and intrigue. The story line, a bit unbelievable, but very interesting...<br />I would recommend this book to those readers who like to lose themselves in a romance novel that may reach beyond the norm, and may bring it's readers into the realm of exciting, maybe far fetched &#34;what if's&#34;.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|written great and of course great actors make a movie. two of the best at that Gary Oldman and Denzel Washington what could be better. hope that one day Denzel can play in my movie.
0345803493|5.0|I chose this rating because I read the first book and couldn't wait to start the second, it held my interest and was a wonderful escape for me.<br />I loved the amazing possibilities.<br />I would recommend this trilogy to those women who need to spice up their everyday lives and could use a little vacation away from the mundane every day life we all tend to lead...
B009FZHYKU|5.0|when i first saw the series i was wondering how they would pull it off and keep everyone wanting more and keep them intrigued on something that was a hit in the theaters well they had me running home or waiting for 9pm every sun and when the season ends it will be a disapoitment and a yearning for the new season to begin.
0345803485|5.0|I chose this rating because being the first of three books, it had my attention and I couldn't put it down...<br />I loved the mere thought of the possible life changing events this young girl was about to experience<br />I highly recommend all three of these books to all women who have romance in their hearts, a sense of adventure in their souls, and an imagination that could use a little outrageous fun!!!
B009HV2JT8|4.0|its a great action with a bit of history. love the plot and the vampires were deffinately cool wanted to see it just from the preview i recomend this movie.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I chose this rating because I love her music, and this cd is great!<br />I like the fact that she is versatile in her songs and abilities, for instance, she doesn't always sound like country. Seems there is a bit of rock and roll in there too..<br />I highly recommend this cd to all who love country/rock and Taylor Swift...
B00068TJM6|5.0|This is a very nice looking watch and not terribly expensive.  An excellent every day piece that catches the eye
B00571F26Y|2.0|I got so bogged down and overwhelmed with the complexities of this book.  The medical &#34;speak&#34; was way over the top for the average person to comprehend.  With head swimming, I struggled to the end, but decided this diet is so extreme that I could never accomplish it.  May be SOME truth to it?  I don't know.  But then, every few years, somebody else comes out with the newest, latest thing that is SO bad for us, or SO good for us.  Caffeine is good for you; no wait, caffeine is bad for you; oat bran is great - will lower cholesterol if you eat it daily (which it DID in my husband's case); no wait, oat bran is BAD for you!  Good grief.  My parents lived to be 92 and 93.  My mother-in-law lived to age 92, and my father-in-law is now 98!!! They ate fried eggs and bacon every day, fried chicken, fried pork chops, real butter, real french fries with, yikes!... hamburgers, roast, steak, mashed potatoes, on and on.  (Lots of veggies, of course.)  Yes, they had high cholesterol but 3 of the 4 parents were never prescribed any medicine for it, no heart disease or cancer. (What they DIDN'T do was smoke or drink alcohol. Well, Daddy smoked a pipe until his death at age 92)  I am now 65 and have high cholesterol.  I am trying to learn how to eat &#34;better&#34; ???, whatever the heck that really is!  This is all way too confusing.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This product came in a good package and worked just as we thought it would.  We are happy with this purchase.  Love this movie.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I had seen this at walmart once, then never again. I was very excited to find it on amazon. I have seen it on broadway and now I can watch it over and over just with less scenery lol
B008602KQI|3.0|We got this movie because our son has enjoyed the book. It was okay to us but our son liked it.<br />I found it to be as creepy as Shirley Jackson's &#34;The Lottery&#34;, but at least there was more depth to the story.<br />Courage, and doing the right thing is good and was portrayed well in this film.
B009LL4LMM|5.0|Really fun game.  Easy to learn but it takes some skill and strategy to advance. Who knew jellyfish in hats would be so adorable?!?
B00884GR0W|5.0|I got goosebumps when I first played this game. The graphic and lighting effects really create a wonderful depth that makes for a very rich experience. The options are nearly infinite as to how you want to progress your character and your unique world. Also, the website for this game is extremely helpful. There's plenty of input on all aspects of gameplay, very helpful people who will gladly assist with questions/thoughts, and even downloadable content (like other people's awesome world creations.)<br />For $5, buying this game is a must. Best game app on the market!
B00A7ZWUJC|3.0|Upbeat, best song is Love Song.  I'm not sure if I would pay full price for it, but I got it for a deal, so it was worth it
B000AAF1U4|5.0|This has got to be one of my favorite Disney movies ever. David Spade was perfect for the role of Kuzco and this movie is just so hilarious. The movie got in the mail just as the Shipping Tracker said it was. I bought this movie for my mother's birthday and she was so happy with it. 5 stars :)
B000EXDS5M|4.0|This Movie is a good movie,  it really opened my eyes to really understand how the outlaws did things.  Two very good actors.
030758836X|1.0|I really want my money back.  I feel HAD! This is the worst book I have attempted to read in a very long time(if ever).
B000ICXQXI|5.0|Okay, so I've never seen the original Psycho up until this point. Unfortunately, I had no idea about what I was missing! This movie kept me second-guessing and on the edge of my seat. The end, to me, was a real twist. I enjoyed every minute of Psycho!
B001AITGWE|5.0|This is a must see. I rented this a long time ago and watched it again just recently. It is very good.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I loved it. Good story, great performances by all. And of course, Maggie Smith and Judi Dench are my favorites. It helps that I identify with the age group. ;^)
B008GANNIC|5.0|some of their best stuff except the &#34;I am&#34; (last track) song that was disappointing but others may not feel that way.  Still best music out right now.
B0071MDA2U|4.0|3-1/2 stars: This second book in the series was good but not quite as good as &#34;Delirium&#34;, the first book. I didn't find the writing as lyrical and hypnotic as in &#34;Delirium&#34;. While there was a lot more action in this book, I didn't &#34;click&#34; with the new characters that much and I found the back and forth between the &#34;then&#34; and &#34;now&#34; to be a little disorienting and at times confusing. It is hard to give specifics on some of my dislikes about this without mentioning any spoilers, so I won't. Overall I am not thrilled with where the storyline seems to be headed but am very curious to see what happens.<br /><br />A note on the &#34;enhanced&#34; kindle version: I got this particular edition with my daughter in mind, also, I was curious to see exactly what an &#34;enhanced&#34; book would be like.  I read the book on my regular kindle and whenever there was supposed to be a video, there was just a note that a video was here but could not be viewed on this device and it would list the name of the video. I would then open up the Kindle app on our iPad and watch the video (if I felt like it). Some of the videos I watched after I finished reading the book. My daughter, who is reading the book on the Kindle app on the iPad, watches the videos as she gets to them. Personally, I don't think these particular videos add too much to the reading experience. Some are mildly interesting and give a little insight into what the author was thinking when she wrote that section or made such and such a decision. The only downside to reading an enhanced version would be the super large file size which made me definitely make sure I deleted the book from my Kindle once I was finished reading it. I'm not sure if I would purchase another &#34;enhanced&#34; version but if it was priced the same as the regular version (which this one was), I might.
0803738412|5.0|My little grandson, age 2.5 years, just loved this book.  There are lots of variations for it to include songs that he knows from preschool.  I always purchase books for him that have a good rhyming verse and the illustrations are just as important.  This hardcover book provided both.  Julia Donaldson is a fabulous author.  We have all of her works.
B003MC5N28|4.0|This book was interesting and enjoyable but the audio production was terrible. Don't listen to it; read it instead. First off, they used cheesy music on and off throughout the book, probably to make it dramatic or suspenseful but all it did was detract from the seriousness of the book. Also, the reader did not say the chapter numbers so moving back and forth between the audio and print book was very difficult. I think the chapter breaks were identified by the cheesy music. The reader was OK but not great. All this put together did not make for an enjoyable listening experience. The book is easy to read and rather predictable for a well-read adult, but this did not detract from the story and my ability to enjoy it.
B007N8RULO|5.0|this is the best game. it's a great app.  one of my favorites. i could spend hours on it and not even realize the time..
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|I loved the book and enjoyed the movie, as well. I didn't like it as much as the book, but still found it a reasonable portrayal of the story and characters. Seeing it all come to life was exciting. If you haven't read the book, I think the movie would still be very good. Several people I know saw the movie without reading the book and still really enjoyed the movie.
B0013A1T8I|5.0|Another great story. The quality is super. Don't be afread to purchase this DVD. A must have for you DVD collection!

B007SGLZP8|4.0|Classic Grisham lawyer government conspiracy novel. Not as good as his first novels but diffently a must read if you a Grisham fan.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|At first I thought this would be the dumbest thing ever. Then my brother got it on my kindle. I played it once and I was addicted.  Best angry birds yet! :)
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great little app that gives you a good idea of how much power is left in your Kindle Fire. Much more informative than the little icon provided in the upper right hand corner.
B009CG2YDE|4.0|It just needs to add support for buttons and it would be perfect. the game is a lot of fun
B0066W1AZK|4.0|Enjoy to time I get to play. I find it hard to put down once you start playing.  Simple but truly fun
0131103628|3.0|As the title says, it is a great reference.  You can certainly read through this book, work the examples, and have a cursory understanding of how C works.  Do that, and you'll be able to read code, understand basically what it does, etc.  But you'll have no clue how to write a new program.  This book will break down each individual command, and never put them together in a big picture kind of way.  Essentially, it is like this book teaches you individual words, but not how to make a sentence.<br /><br />For any beginners out there that need not only the basics, but also some tips for real-world application, and how to conceptually write programs, etc, I recommend you check out Wibit.net  Their video tutorials are exceptional, and will baby-step you through the process of getting started.  I personally started with this book, and was still semi-lost and close to where I started after reading it.  The guys at Wibit.net will teach you the basics, as well as the why and how of what you're doing, so you can actually write programs.  THEN, you can go back and refer to this book... that is it's real utility.
B007V65R54|5.0|Silver has a knack for seeing the big picture through many details and then communicating it to people who aren't staticians. Great book.
B002O3Z4QQ|5.0|I taped the mini-series years ago when it aired on HBO. I really liked the series and have watched it many times over the year. While browsing the Amazon DVD selection I saw that &#34;From the Earth to the Moon&#34; was available on DVD and at a good price. I'm retired and watch my nickles and dimes so I ordered the DVD set. I was very pleased with the quality, especially when I watched it on a HD TV.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This app is very handy, not just for reading ebooks, but thanks to &#34;send to kindle&#34; I can send PDFs and docs to my phone for quick reference.
B009FO908A|5.0|I love this song. Even if you're a fan-girling Directioner or a Directionator (One Direction  + Hater) or just looking for a good song to dance to you'll love this song. It's got catchy guitar rifts and awesome harmonies and lyrics. And if you are a Directioner Daddy Direction, Vain Zayn, Nialler, Hazza and Lou Bear ALL have solos. (Though you'll have to be quick to catch Harry's solo.)
B001EN71CW|5.0|Great series. I wish it was still on the air with new episodes. Better than most T V stories and many movies.
0547884591|5.0|I have read a couple chapters and jus can't get enough. So entertaining yet informative. It is a non fiction page turner. The man is a genius and the book is outstanding.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|I have a friend who plays this game so I thought it would be good, but it is hard to make much of a score.
B000003C4K|5.0|Had it been released only one year earlier, \\"Bonded By Blood\\" might be generally regarded as one of the earliest, and most primitive thrash metal albums ever. (It would rank right alongside Metallica's \\"Kill `Em All\\" and Slayer's \\"Show No Mercy.\\") But it wasn't, so it doesn't. Nevertheless, Exodus have created one very fine thrash/speed metal record in their debut, 1985's \\"Bonded By Blood.\\"And, with its vicious, cutthroat tempos, blood-pumping riffs, fast bass lines, and chaotic solos, it is a textbook lesson in Eighties thrash metal. It would also prove to go on to become one of the genre's most influential releases of all time, as it was one of the first to feature the trade-off guitar solo style. (A style previously explored by only Judas Priest and Iron Maiden.) Indeed, axemen Gary Holt and Rick Hunolt take turns ripping out solos like it ain't no thing. All told, what we have here is a very satisfying and enthralling debut from the San Francisco natives.<br /><br />The title song is a terrifically ripping and rousing set opener backed by catchy, thrashing grooves, fiery, machine gun riffing, deft drumming, and powerful high-pitched vocals (including an Anthrax-worthy shout of the title phrase in the mosh pit-ready choruses). The guitarists trade-off two blistering solos (the first of which is a fairly lengthy and winding one), here, too; and the lyrics are also of noteworthy (lines like \\"metal takes its place\\" and \\"bang your head\\" stand out.) Holt and Hunolt continue setting their fretboards on fire throughout the next track, \\"Exodus,\\" a tune that may feature prominently audible and strong, beeping bass lines -- but it is mostly the six-stringers' show. It boasts scorching buzzsaw-fast leads, two tastily ripping, and fairly melodic solos, and some nice, Iron Maiden-esque twin guitar harmonies near the end. \\"And Then There Were None\\" is the record's first and only mid-tempo cut, featuring relatively restrained tempos, chunky, chug and churn riffs, another insanely memorable chorus, and two solos that careen all over the map. The tune is immediately counterbalanced, however, by the frenetic \\"A Lesson In Violence,\\" which peels out of the gate at blinding speeds.<br /><br />\\"Metal Command\\" offsets one screaming and totally-off-the-rails solo with one nicely melodic solo, and tacks on a bouncy little drum solo to end. \\"Piranha\\" brings a ton more abrasive guitar crunch and breakneck soloing, but its main highlight is its hefty double bass drumming. \\"No Love\\" is like many Eighties thrash anthems in that it begins with a beautiful acoustic intro. Some call this unnecessary, but this reviewer disagrees -- I think it is a good monotony breaker. And besides, this is more than just an \\"Orion\\"-era Metallica-esque rip-off because this one uses flamenco/Spanish guitars. The song then turns to hooky, galloping riffs, soaring harmonies, and wailing solos. Next up comes the record's probable pinnacle, \\"Deliver Us To Evil,\\" which features another epic trade-off guitar solo section -- by my count, Holt and Hunolt rip out eight solos (!) in all, here. The proper end of the album (\\"Strike Of The Beast\\") hits hard and in suitably ferocious fashion, with still more blistering, rip-roaring chainsaw riffage and fairly lengthy, wild, Slayer-esque shredding solos.<br /><br />\\"Bonded By Blood\\" is an excellent thrash album, no matter how overlooked and unsung as it may be. And when you add the two scorching and blazing fast live renditions of \\"And Then There Were None\\" and \\"A Lesson In Violence\\" to the mix, and the end result ought-to be just about an essential purchase for even casual fans of the genre.ly memorable chorus, and two solos that careen all over the map.

B0002KPIQY|5.0|I am a substance abuse counselor and this movie displays the negative consequences associated with heroin use. Also, the disease of addiction knows no boundaries, anyone can be affected!
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|Love the game but some players won't take their turn, want to resign but how? Wish folks wouldn't spell out the word...DRAW SOMETHING!! Haven't had any problems ...so far
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Love this show. Season 2 has more plots about the geeky foursome and their gal pal across the hall. The writing and the acting both come together in this series. Even my Mom likes this series and I'm sure she doesn't get a lot of the jokes. The gag real is a real bonus!
B008X9Z4I8|5.0|Excellent cover for the Kindle. It fits in a large purse or briefcase with no problem and is very convenient to carry.
1609611543|5.0|This book was well written. It confirmed what my functional medicine Dr. said about gluten. My husband who was very scepible about changing his diet, read the book and is on board with going &#34;gluten free&#34;.There are helpful menus and recipes in the book. My husband and I are working together to make this very healthy lifestyle change.
B004GJDQT8|3.0|can't really write a review because i downloaded it by accident then deleted it from my tablet.  sorry, not much help.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|Serenity is a fast moving, interesting movie incorporating the characters of the series &#34;Firefly&#34;.  The plot and characters stayed true to the series (which never should have been cancelled as it was excellent!) My only problem  with the movie was the demise of a character who I wished had survived. Well worth watching!
B003NTSBUG|5.0|You watch the movie, then want to watch it again.  It keeps you thinking; the cast and setting are great.  Five stars!
6305692572|5.0|This movie will make most men feel like a dirtbag! While I do love my wife just as much as the man in the movie does he is just way better at showing it!
B002SYXCVK|5.0|If you don't care for, typical holday music, or get sick of hearing it on every radio station and in every store, this is the album for you.  Perfect background for holiday parties, soulful, mellow, and not a single fa-la-la-la-la to be found!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|My family has watched this movie atleast 20 times since it's release and love it every single time! Constant action and loads of fun!
B001OQCV6A|4.0|I enjoyed this movie and I thought it was a solid 4 star rating.  The cast and the acting were done very well and made the story along with the action scenes. The teamwork of Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) and Dr. Watson (Jude Law) was played perfectly and they looked like old friends in the movie helping each other and supporting each other.<br /><br />Watson dreams though of a normal life and being around Sherlock always creates too much action and danger.  He is close to becoming married and he wonders how he can juggle a normal life with a wife and have Sherlock as a best friend.  The movie revolves around a gruesome series of murders and finally Sherlock Holmes learns about a new mortal enemy.<br /><br />It is entertaining and fun to watch.  I recommend it to you.
B003SI84D6|5.0|The best western released in my lifetime! (I'm 28) The actors in this movie were to put it simply: Amazing
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was little confusing at the end. Was not quite sure about it think I will read the last two chapters again. Might understand the second time around. A great read
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Enjoyed every minute in the past.Brought back some happy  some sad memories.Sometimes I traveled  along with Jake re living a hard time for Americans.
B008DKBPTO|4.0|wife liked the style and it protects her kindle,and holds it in place, price was right for what we got
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't put it down. Great follow up to the first. I am looking forward to reading  the third book!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Gets better every season. The character development is amazing. I am getting attached to these people more evry episode. Cant wait until episode.
1419707663|5.0|Got this for my 9 year old nephew. Great books to help encourage reading and the price was great. I have to say my 10 year old daughter also enjoys these books.
B0033807C2|5.0|I LOVED all of the Percy Jackson's books can't wait to read heroes of the Olympus! You should totally read this if you're looking for a fun, exciting story:)
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is perfect for the Kindle Fire. It&acute;s my number one app choice whenever I get a few minutes of play time. Easy to use with several options to choose for different levels of play.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Totally unexpected and incredibly awesome.  If you're a fan of the printed word I am pretty sure you need this.
B0084BMUFA|4.0|A very good holiday read to help remind you the positive side of people, situations and the holidays.  Of course it is well written, it would not have risen to it high status without being so.  If you've seen any version of the movie, take the time to read the book.  The descriptions in the book are just as vibrant as the movie(s) and have the benefit of the authors reasons for the imagery.
B001EC2ISA|4.0|If you were alive when this movie was made, it is a must-have for your collection. I had it on VHS and finally decided to upgrade to DVD.
0807262013|5.0|A very good end to a very good trilogy. Readers of the story were very good and easy to follow
B0083P1QUM|1.0|The early Scarpetta books were excellent,and I recommend them.  I will not waste my time or money to read her anymore.  The books deteriorated and took the reader into a bizarre world populated by unlikable characters that we used to care about.  If you want a great read, try Michael Connelly.
B001QXCYZY|5.0|Works perfect on my laptop and sound is really crisp and clear. It sounds like a real studio Mic. Works good with magix music maker and other music software
B006IYG5HE|4.0|I find these mysteries by Jo Nesbo to be page turners.  The main character, Harry Hole is the typical imperfect detective type.  He is very smart, persistent person who does not follow the rules.  Some of the content is rather grim.  The characters are very interesting and colorful.
B000000OUW|5.0|THIS IS A GREAT BAND..  TTHE PRICE WAS RIGHT THE SERVICE  IS SUPER GOOD..  I THINK THIS IS A GOOD METAL BAND....
B000055Y0X|5.0|Okay, I admit, this review is biased because I'm a life-long Stanley Kubrick fan.  Dr. Strangelove is one of his earlier films and sets a mark very high for his later work which, I believe, he met.<br /><br />Check out this movie!  You'll laugh until you cry, and then you'll cry some more...I mean laugh some more.
B000001FGG|5.0|I PICKED THIS RATING BECUSE I LIKE THIS BAND  ITS OLD AND I GREW UP LISTENING TO THESE GUYS PLAY...A GREAT OLD BAND.......
B00881VLCE|5.0|This puzzle is fun and relaxing! I use it everyday! I would definitely recommend this app to friends and family!
B009H442DG|4.0|First and foremost, ignore the plastic faces and the spray-on hair...sometimes I wonder if that was part of the marketing - getting people talking about the cover is publicity regardless.  Inside is a surprising and pleasant addition to the gamut of Christmas recordings coming out each year to choose from. Is it \\"electrifying\\"?  At times it has it moments...it is classy, fun, nostalgic and entirely appropriate to be added to the traditions of this time of year.<br /><br />Best songs?<br /><br />\\"Baby, It's Cold Outside\\", which has Travolta trying to head home without much success.  I know that the pair wanted the cd to be like old friends coming over and singing carols, which this accomplishes well with the quirky banter and laughing through the track.<br /><br />\\"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas\\" - Guest Cliff Richard is a welcome guest on this nice version of a great song...all three artists combine well together.<br /><br />\\"I Think You Might Like It\\" - This is one of the great moments on the cd and should be a staple at Christmas radio...it's catchy and allows Olivia to sing in full voice (I'm not a huge fan of her breathy vocals constantly).  Looking forward to a video if one is made...could be pretty fun to see them together with old footage too.<br /><br />\\"Winter Wonderland\\" - Tony Bennett and the big band on this track is stellar...altho Travolta trying to hold his own with Tony (as well as Streisand on \\"I'll be Home for Christmas\\")is hilarious.  The song is fun and they do it well.<br /><br />\\"Christmas Waltz\\" - John fairs well on this solo number.  He does a good crooner at times.<br /><br />\\"Deck the Halls\\" - James Taylor...enuf said.<br /><br />Hilarious Moments?<br /><br />- The end of Winter Wonderland where they start exclaiming \\"Tony!\\" - \\"John!  Tony!\\" and then Tony doesn't say a word...ONJ just laughs...it was hysterical and awkward.<br /><br />- The mother-in-law \\"swinging from the chandelier\\" in \\"I Think You Might Like It\\".<br /><br />- Travolta making the yuletide \\"gay\\" in \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\".<br /><br />- Streisand appearing to drums and a wild flourish of music in \\"I'll Be Home For Christmas\\" and then actually harmonizing with Travolta.  It was kind of cool hearing Olivia and Streisand singing together though.<br /><br />In summary, with so many polished perfect Christmas cds out there to buy, they all start to sound bland and the same.  This definitely breaks that mold and is decent without being boring.<br /><br />Again, skip the cover...listen to the music.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This a great intense work out and you only need 20 mins! I don't have a lot of time for working out everyday so I like how it is so intense that you feel like you worked out for a hour when you're done.
B001B51B9M|4.0|Great songs and cast ensemble. Musical numbers are superb and entertaining.  They don't make musicals like this anymore. Production is top rated.
1451695195|4.0|Very interesting book - it delves into our mind more and the descriptions of pre-heaven and heaven are quite unusual - I enjoyed reading it.
B005JZBP8W|5.0|Lerner and Loewe is truly one of the best teams in musical theater.  Costumes and art direction is excellent with some of the memorable songs written for a play.
B0052UYJDC|4.0|This book is great to help you declutter your life.  If you want something to help you decide where to start the process it will help.  I love to simplify but I am not as extreme as the author and with kids running all over it can get overwhelming so this does help me decide to toss and donated things taking up space.
B007VT6QSI|4.0|I know my granddaughter will like this, even tho she rarely uses cd anymore, now Downloads to IPod. But now she can also use it in the car.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|My brother recommended this show to me and I was not interested.  I did not like horror zombie movies and things like that, but he persisted so I caught the first episode in a rerun and I loved it.  My husband and I are now both completely hooked on this show!  I must say you have to watch the seasons in order to understand all that has happened and what is happening.  I purchased season one and watched them all to catch up to season 2 then watched season 2 and now season 3 on AMC.  This show is more about relationships, and how you trust people.  It is much more than zombies, yes there are zombies and it is violent and graphic (very well done too) but it is more about survival.  It really makes you think, about a lot of things in life.  Try it!!!!
B009B2VBWE|5.0|I enjoyed this iteration of Diana as much as any of her previous efforts.  The vocals and piano are easy to listen to when working, walking, or relaxing.
B000ICXQXI|5.0|With the upcoming film &#34;Hitchcock&#34; I decided to re-watch both versions of &#34;Psycho&#34; and refresh my memory. &#34;Psycho&#34;'s chilling realism is just as relevant today as it was 50 years ago. Outstanding performances by the entire cast bring that delicious element of fear that makes Hitchcock the master of suspense. Anthony Perkins portrayal of a sick, vicious serial killer was horrifying in its simplicity. The subtle ebb and flow of the sanity of his character was a testament to the timelessness of this character (an element sorely lacking in the 1998 &#34;remake&#34;) Janet Leigh takes up the conflicted nature of her less than moral heroine and portrays her, flaws and all. In the remake all you can do is count down the moments until Anne Heche takes her fateful shower. Leigh makes you feel for the character, but still not feel too bad when &#34;Mother&#34; visits her during bath time. The rest of the cast performed ably, while not quite attaining the level of mastery that Perkins and Leigh present. 50 years later and the ending of &#34;Psycho&#34; is still one of the greatest, and darkest twists in the genre or even in cinematic history. Perkins looking up at the camera and smirking wickedly is far more chilling than either murder scene. According to some this was the film that spurred the slasher sub-genre, while still retaining the fundamentals of an Old Hollywood Horror film. Psycho is the reason, that no matter the year, we all truly do go a little mad sometimes.
B008RC72G8|3.0|I lol'd quite a few times but most of the funny parts were seen in the previews that you saw on TV
B005COO1X6|4.0|Again, this is not one of my favorites by Stephen King, but it was a good short story and definitely held my attention!  I read it in one sitting!!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This was a total steal on an awesome movie! Best superhero film ever! I'm glad Robert Downey jr sobered up.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It really warms me up, and somewhat remains me of good times I have experienced in my freshmen year .
B000NY12CI|5.0|Ayaan Hirsi Ali  captures the brutality of her homeland of Somalia and her experiences with Islam in a very stirring and poignant work that had me turning pages non-stop.  It's both horrifying and humanizing the cost to a society that allows a religion to come before equality among it's people.  This woman is obviously very brave and very determined to have come so far and achieved so much when the only thing she had to expect from life was forced marriage and countless tragedies.  An important book for our times.
B008Q09K2U|4.0|As a Kindle user, it was a terrific read.  I was most interested in the descriptions of life in Yemen,the customs of the various groups and the diversity and allegiance of the tribes and central government.  I take it that the subject matter was well researched.<br /><br />The story line was adequately gripping and the reading of the book was a page turner.  I loved the humor that Corey introduced albeit sometimes it got  bits too much. All things considered, I recommend it as an excellent read over Xmas.<br /><br />Anita Grinbergs  ..

B004WESFZW|5.0|It was a Great movie. Its offered at a Great price, even it its used.  I dont think I will tire of this one.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|it's ok,  not really my kind of movie. in some spots it was hard to follow. No keen on the story line.
B008R14YBK|5.0|Apparently she is a good performer.  At least my niece put her on the Christmas list.  I won't know more until she opens it.
B002BJGYV2|2.0|I recently purchased Gilmore Girls season 5, when it went on sale for $8.  I love this show and was excited to add to my DVD collection, but realized how horrible the quality was of these particular DVDs.  The sound is awful!  I need to return these DVDs.  I would gladly pay full price, so that I could receive a quality product.  The two star rating is for the DVD quality, not the rating of this show.
0811870413|5.0|Ive been making bread for many years and was looking for new recipes. Something easy to follow, with straight to the point technique.<br />I first went to their bakery and tried their bread. I fell in love right away. I had to buy their book.<br />It's very well explained, they use metric system so make sure you have a scale for that.<br />After a few batch you'll find yourself not even using the book anymore and trying to make up your own creation.
B004EPZ07U|5.0|ok  i don't like haveing to waste time writeing any more than what i said in the subject line thanks
160774273X|5.0|As a french man I grew up eating bread everyday. Going to the bakery almost every other day with my mom to buy pain de campagne, croissant etc... I started baking school when I was 16. Now I'm 31 and still making most of my bread myself.<br />I have been looking for different techniques throughout the years.<br />Living in San Francisco I discovered &#34; Tartine&#34;, I bought their book a few months back and loved it.<br /><br />In this book though what I like the most is the use of metric system! I wish everyone in here would use this, makes recipe just more precise and easier to accomplished.<br />I haven't made any bread from this book yet but I can already tell it's a serious book.<br />You must go through the reading of the first pages. It's long and technical but you will need it to understand the principle of percentage in bread making.<br />I love that they including pizza though recipes and example.<br />I cannot wait to try their recipes and make my friends taste my creations.

B009NOVCSS|4.0|If you opt to buy the 5-CD \\"Super Deluxe Edition\\" for the 5-song \\"I.B.C. Studios Demos\\"(on \\"Disc Five\\") be cautioned, that for these recordings, which predate The Stones' involvement with manager Allen Klein & his ABKCO company, that ABKCO has no tape source(reportedly Mick Jagger possesses the tape), so rather than ask Jagger to look for the tape, ABKCO did the simple thing, and they dubbed the five songs from bootleg. \\"Diddley Diddley Daddy\\"(still with the glaring speed fluctuation during the intro), \\"Roadrunner\\", \\"Baby What's Wrong\\" & \\"I Want to Be Loved\\" have been dubbed from one of the \\"Swingin' Pig\\" label bootleg CD's(either \\"Bright Lights, Big City:20th Anniversary Edition\\" or the \\"I.B.C. Demos\\" CD E.P.), but for unknown reasons, ABKCO didn't like the source for \\"Bright Lights, Big City\\" contained on those two bootleg CD's, so the song has been dubbed from a tinny-sounding vinyl bootleg, and no attempt has been made to de-crackle it. Granted, the source used for all five songs on the original \\"Trademark of Quality\\" label 1970's \\"Bright Lights, Big City\\" vinyl bootleg L.P. was itself a tape dub from an acetate, but this was an acetate that was still in pristine condition.<br /><br />  And I have always questioned whether \\"I Want to Be Loved\\" was actually from the \\"I.B.C. Studios\\" demos, or whether \\"Trademark of Quality\\" simply pretended that the song(which had never been heard by most Americans until the 1990's) was part of the \\"I.B.C. Studios\\" demos.  \\"I Want to Be Loved\\" DOES sound audibly identical to the version on the B-side of their first British Decca single \\"Come on\\"<br /><br />  There are many people (including me) who have wished that The Rolling Stones would finally permit ABKCO to bring us a definitive collection of 1960's Rolling Stones outtakes; to bring us a multi-disc set that would be every thing that \\"Metamorphosis\\" could have and should have been. But, inevitably ABKCO would find some way to totally or partly screw it up.<br /><br />  As forthe 5-CD \\"Grrr\\", it's a decent selection of Stones singles and album tracks, but 13 of the songs are edited versions, due to CD capacity limits. Disc 5 has the \\"I.B.C. Studios\\" demos as a 13 minute disc, but if the 80 hits and album tracks had  been evenly spread across five full length discs, there would have been no need to use edited versions. As for the song line-up, the songs are not quite in chronological order, and there are some baffling inclusions and omissions. \\"That's How Strong My Love Is\\" & \\"Flight 505\\" are puzzling inclusions, while \\"Tell Me(You're Coming Back)\\" and \\"Around and Around\\" are omitted. Go figure. As for myself, I found an \\"alternative source\\" for the 5-CD set, and I am left with no doubt that I made the correct decision.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Welcome to the world of the original and still best version of the Star Trek universe. I'm glad these movies weren't treated like the original Star Wars trilogy and re-done with CGI images. The weak story lines on Search for Spock and  The Final Frontier still can't take away from the rest of this must have collection.
0061474355|5.0|I am absolutely in love with this series. This is the only book I can read again and again and always find something new!
0767817664|4.0|Splendid combo of horror and comedy. Roddy is excellent as the master of horror. A movie to watch again and again.

B0079J28NW|3.0|This might sound dated but, you don't have to remember the 60's to enjoy the 60's. Good music is timeless. The visuals in Blu-ray are worth the expierence.

B004FGMDOQ|3.0|Unusual<br />Very enjoyable in an eerie sort of way! It does exactly what it says on the tin I guess, worth reading for sure
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The books end on a strong point with this novel (and definately not as I expected).  The author took a bit of a dark turn towards the end, really showing the travesty of war rather than your standard sugar-coated version you see in many novels.  Large thumbs up!
B008RYN44U|2.0|I really like No Doubt and I'm happy they've released a new album, even happier that the new material is solid.  I am also sorely disappointing that the dynamic range of this album is so squashed that listening to it for any length of time is fatiguing.  The first track has so much distortion, and every sound is around the same volume level.  This doesn't need to be a 16 bit recording as they are probably only using the top one or two bits.<br /><br />Even though No Doubt has become more mainstream, elements of their Ska roots still show here and there, and Ska should be dynamic and punchy, not squashed and smeary.  I honestly would like to get a refund for this.  It's just mastered that poorly.<br /><br />I purchased the MP3 version from Amazon.  Can anyone tell me if the CD or vinyl version has more dynamic range than this?
819073914X|5.0|I read this book when I was in 5th grade, and I fell in love with it immediately. Now i read it again and find it more heartbreaking, probably because i knew what is the ending gonna be. People will hold their breath when they reading it, because the story is so realistic. Overall it's an awesome novel for kids in middle school, or even adults.
044042321X|3.0|If you've already read the novel you know what to expect - basically this graphic novel adaptation sticks to the source material in terms of plotting and dialogue very closely. The art is serviceable and won't necessarily leave you in awe but since these comics were done independently from the HBO series it is interesting to see differences in visual character design between the 2 adaptations.
B003ORZ83K|5.0|I was familiar with Jane Austen&#34;s work.I still enjoy it each time I see it. The actors ability to portrait their character pure<br />profesional.
0553106635|5.0|As wonderful as the first 2 books in George R.R. Martin's 'Song of Ice and Fire' series are think of them as mere setups for the epic story about to unfold in book #3 - 'A Storm of Swords.' This one has it all and then some. Don't let the 1000+ page count put you off this one is worth every page and paragraph.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Great movie. I can recommend a lot this movie pack. I plan to purchase a 3D TV in the future!!!
0425264351|4.0|The first book in Lee Childs' Jack Reacher series, does a good job in setting up his grim, man of stone protagonist in this lean, well paced tale of counterfeiting, small town crime and revenge.  While the emphasis is clearly on the action, Childs manages to pepper the story throughout with interesting factoids and wisdom nuggets that actually makes this read a somewhat educational experience to boot.
B002QRWJA4|4.0|This is an excellent film.  The music is great.  It might take acouple of viewings to actually understand the full details of the plot.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game.  It reminds me of the board walk when we were kids only better because I'm winning here.  lots of fun.
0547884591|4.0|I'm still reading this book currently, however, the material thus far has been great.  It has really inspired me to examine about how I go about learning anything.  Can't wait to get into the cooking as well.
B006YXTRHY|4.0|I liked this movie, but it dragged on a bit more than I would have liked. I love the series, but it seems this movie could have been combined with the second one rather than stretch it out into two movies.
B004JMY312|4.0|This movie is good fun and entertaining enough to appeal to kids and adults alike! Would recommend and watch again.
B0045XICB2|5.0|I loved this movie...for Twilight fans it just continues the story and allows the viewers to see the charachters developed more. I plan on purchasing the entire series on DVD/Blue Ray after they release the final movie from the theatres.
B005G5PPGS|4.0|I enjoyed this book and was left to wonder to what other applications this would apply. I would read another by Michael Lewis.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Kept me guessing the whole time. Really loved the style of writing and the plot twists. Looking forward to reading more of Flynn's books.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  Well written and made me want more to read.  Too bad the author died, would have loved to see more books from him.
B000IFQLLY|4.0|A Great CD for the collection. Some of the newer tunes I enjoyed the most. The oldies remind me of my youth and college.
B009YU6FJM|5.0|As per usual, Deftones comes through.  Awesome sound and lyrics, and delivered the way only Deftones can pull off - dark and sweet.
B007G3H8Y0|4.0|Yet another good album from an adult contemporary band with catchy tunes. It's not &#34;Train&#34; (first album) or &#34;Drops of Jupiter&#34; but still worth the $.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|These are my new favorite artists.  Imaginative arrangements both musically and visually.  Check out their videos on YouTube.<br />Instrumental music at its finest.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My whole family loves this movie, very funny and we can't wait for the next one to come out-the trailer looks great!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I have always enjoyed playing Mahjong.  This is something I always go back to.  I play it while taking long trips, while waiting in Dr's offices....  anytime I have too much free time on my hands or just need to relax!
0547884591|5.0|I love Tim's writing style.  I have been a fan of his since the 4 Hour Work Week 1st edition.  I go back to his books over and over, and the 4 hour Chef fits right in.  I really enjoy the layout and reference book style.  It is fun to read even if I wasn't looking to get anything out of it (which I have).  If you have enjoyed his previous books in the 4 hour series than pick this one up.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was an excellent read.  From Book 1-3, it just got more and more exciting and tantalizing.  It was well written, obviously well thought out with a lot of research.  I hope they don't decide to make this a movie.  It will be completely misunderstood and one could not help but see it as porn.  It is a love story like no other.  You must be open-minded.
B000R9J3XE|5.0|Amazing music!<br /><br />Is there a better band with a woman singer? I think not! Shirley is amazing and I wish I could meet her.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|If you like intrigue, have some familiarity with London and enjoy a book with a little British twist read this..
B007SGLZP8|3.0|As usual Grisham sucks you right into the action from the get go. It kind of dragged through the middle and there were not many clues for the reader. But Grisham is as always a first rate story teller.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|It's a good free game,  done in the style of Diablo 3. A. bit taxing on battery life but it helps me get my game fix when I'm idle at work.
0385342063|5.0|This was my first Kinsella novel.  I wanted to read something fun, light and uplifting and this hit the bill.  After reading this, I became a fan and she is now my go-to girl when I want a distraction from the heaviness of the world and a jump back in times to when success is possible for anyone.  Our heroine is a modern-day, intelligent, goofy, hip, young woman. The plot almost doesn't matter, because the character is so delightful and we know she'll end up a winner.  Her adventures, predictaments and dialogue were laugh out loud engagements.  I looked forward to my evening time, before bed reading that sent me to sleep with a giggle.  Perfect for unwinding and getting back to enjoying life.  Renee Kohanski author of [[ASIN:B005VFMODK CheatShow]]
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|I love animation/cartoon movies and this one just shows that animation is getting better and better. This movie had a bit different story line than the typical Disney cartoon movie (ala Little Mermaid, Beauty & the Beast, etc.). I loved how the story wove all the threads together at the end.<br /><br />It's reasonable priced and very convenient to stream it via Amazon Prime. I have high speed internet and the movie looked like a Blu-Ray to me.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon!
B004EPYZSK|4.0|This movie is loosely based on a graphic novel.  I thought they did a great job of creating a fun adventure with great visual effects and a nice romp that included some big time favorite actors.<br /><br />It is a combo of the typical wild west theme of the lone, mysterious stranger come to town with the big bad rancher and the pretty woman with a problem.  But added to that is the mysterious aliens who are snatching up people and seem to be there for an even bigger nefarious purpose.  The aliens give the other groups a reason to unite and fight.<br /><br />The story is told in present time and flashbacks to explain how things got to the way they are at the opening.  I've heard this described as steampunk, but personally I wouldn't go there with it.  It's not a knock your socks off dramatic type movie and its not meant to be.  Its enjoyable if you don't take it too seriously and just sit back ready for some fun.<br /><br />The special extras are worth taking a look to see how they did stuff.<br /><br />All in all, it is worth the purchase.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|First off, the movie is fantastic. Best super-hero movie ever made, bar none.<br /><br />Secondly, the package. It looks nice, and the front is holographic, adding a nice touch to this combo pack. I don't have a blu-ray player, but since this pack comes with a DVD and digital version, it's not a problem. Plus, when I eventually get a blu-ray player I will be all set.<br /><br />Get this movie! You will not be disappointed!
0783225970|4.0|My recommendation is that you should be a &#34;mafia&#34; movie fan to enjoy.  The good movie rating is by my cousin.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I love the 70's and the 80's music.  Rich soulful voice, he's rocking it.  Great album.  I bought 3! Buy.
B00009ZYC1|5.0|This was a fun movie!  Great for family movie night!  A good addition to family movie treasury section and good entertainment  for sleepovers or playdates.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|This is a great movie. One of my favorite animated movies in a while. And having the different media types is very convenient.<br /><br />I love the minions. This movie is good for kids to adults. Super cute.
0316228532|3.0|This book was described as new and in excellent condition but there was markings all over the front cover like dried glue or something had taken the new &#34;sheen&#34; off.  It was a gift, so I was disappointed that it didn't look new.
B0060Q962Q|5.0|I enjoy games like this. and this one did not disappointing.<br /><br />Nothing ground breaking but worth a download if you want to play connect 4!
1580176941|4.0|I got lots of inspiration from their photos and the recipe's taste great. I would've given it 5 stars but the layout is just a little disjointed for a traditional cookbook user like me. Great price for a nice little project book.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This does everything I could ask. Although reading may not be awesome on my phone the app does a lot to help make it as good as possible. Best way to read books on my phone in my opinion (I am invested in the kindle store)
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I loved this book! At first I was wary about reading a book that was written in the voice of a child, however, little Jack still manages to tell the whole story and I absolutely loved all his little ways of explaining everyday things in his world. The writer was spot on!
B0015AARJI|5.0|This was exactly what I expected and what I wanted. Very happy.<br /><br />An aside this controller can be used via bluetooth to things like an android phone. It does take some doing to make work but it is not impossible. For what its worth.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Pinterest is a lot of fun! This app works ok, but it gets stuck sometimes and you haave to close it and reopen it.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|File explorer lets you navigate your files in a familiar looking layout (like a mac or widows computer)<br /><br />A must have for side loading or looking for old downloaded files.
B006YXTRHY|5.0|Sad to see the series end, but brilliantly done!  Methinks a sequel written by someone is in the offing . . .
B009HV2JT8|5.0|I know the concept seem kind of silly, but it works. The book is very well done, and the movie as well. Overall, both the book and the movie were very entertaining if you don't take yourself to seriously. Seth Grahmn Smith is a genuis
B006LSZECO|5.0|I greatly enjoyed this book and couldn't put it down.  I was compelled and intrigued by the psychological depth and dysfunction of the characters.  I loved this book; however, I can't decide if the author was brilliant or lazy in the way she ended this novel.
B000V39KDO|5.0|Action packed and thrilling all the way through. The movie is beautiful and while it isn't a very deep movie, you will enjoy the ride!
B009GIPDQS|3.0|The story is very fragmented and the plot appears to have been developed on the run.  Not up to Mr Grisham's usual standard
B007JCP8FE|5.0|Awesome music and Brent Smith's voice is perfect! Another wonderful album. A bit heavier than some of the old let ones and definitely worth it.
B00A31UXLW|4.0|This is another book in the a Harry Bosch series.Mr Connelly stories have well thought out and plausible plots. His characters are very human
B009LL4LMM|3.0|A little chanllenging, but not a bad game.  Hey it was free so that makes it even better to play.
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|The download froze my phone.  I had to pull out my battery to reset it.  It was not worth that hassle.  I would not advise the use of this one unless you know the secret.<br />Update:  It finally reloaded okay, but I don't know how.  The game itself is great, much more fun then original with tricky starwars moves.  Therefore, it is now in the stars.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|i loved this game for my kindle fire and played it for many days straight, until the new update came out.  It crashes and won't open.  I have waited days for gameloft to put out a bug fix or something.  I keep checking and there hasn't been any news other than they know about the bug...  I feel sorry for anyone that paid cash for gameplay because they haven't even offered perks for all the down time in game play (its been a week that I haven't been able to play because of the bug).  It would be nice if they offered to freeze your progress or free $ once they get it up and running again... so far costumer service has been null and silent on this issue.  I think they are going to let this project just die- which is sad because I do enjoy this title.
B005IQZB14|4.0|This is book is fun and easy to read.  Whether or not you would ever contemplate doing a hike such as the one the author did, her experiences are worth reading.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A beatiful work of literary genius.<br />Probably the best book that I have EVER read.... and i have read a quite a few.
B00563K38U|1.0|I do a lot of reading in a book club and also extra reading outside of the book club - and this is one of the worst books I have encountered in many years.  Completely boring and pointless.  I only persevered through to the end because I felt obligated to read it for the next book club meeting!
B001GQ2TGA|4.0|Was this the last &#34;new material &#34; CD that Enya put out? I miss her beautiful voice! Anyway, as a Christmas album you may find yourself playing it a lot around that time but not so often otherwise. I prefer the original solo version of Oiche Chiuin, and some of the other selections were new to me but as a Christmas album I just don't see even most Enya fans giving it much year round play. It is a worthy addition to your Christmas or Enya collection.
B001BKVWYG|3.0|We choose this rating because as far as the movie went, it was a good movie, but at our age we wouldn't have enjoyed the music on a regular basis.  My husband realized since our grandson is in a band, he would really enjoyed it and did!<br /><br />So for us, it's 3 stars, but for him, who received it, it's a 5.<br />Pennie
B002C4YYEU|5.0|This movie delivers.  I found it to be exciting in spots, funny and very moving.  The acting and effects worked together for once.
B0099114WO|2.0|The actors are spectacular, don't get me wrong but if you are having ANY issues or pains in your current relationship or haven't healed from a past hurt, just walk away from this movie. It is incredibly sad and I honestly wanted to punch Tommy Lee Jones in the face about a hundred times for his attitude and dismissal. The best part of the movie is the last 3 minutes while the credits roll. This is NOT a feel good, uplifting movie.
0316069434|4.0|This is another very strong entry in the Harry Bosch series. In my mind, however, the strength of this series is less the Harry Bosch character, but more of the investigative aspect that Connelly puts into play each time. Or at least that's what I find most fascinating and riveting; the interviewing of witnesses, gathering clues, doing the research, acting on hunches, and all the rest of the things that go into sniffing out leads and zeroing in on suspects. Of course Bosch is the spark, the guy who instigates most of these things, but his personality  and charm (or lack of it!) isn't what keeps me turning the pages, it's the investigation itself. And this is a very good case, jumping 20 years from the LA riots in '92 --- and the Gulf War the year before ---, to the present.<br /><br />Likeable or not, Harry is a strong character and determined as usual to solve the crime. I like that way that this novel explores his still developing relationship with his teenage daughter (and how they are bonding through the enjoyment of listening to jazz music, of all things!), and also his new girlfriend. These situations really add a layer, or two, to the story and give it an even more human element. The plot falls into cliche territory at times (once again, combative, hard-headed, anti-authority Harry runs into a superior who is out to get him), and a certain surprise near the end of the novel left me scratching my head as far as the character's motivation. Also odd were moments such as Harry thinking that a woman named Anneke Jespersen would be German. Maybe some geographically-challenged Americans would be stumped about that person's nationality, but an experienced detective like Harry Bosch? I don't see it. That picky detail aside, this is a typically engrossing Michael Connelly novel, the type that you won't want to put down once you start reading it. If you're a fan of this series, you'll want to read this one ASAP.
0547884591|5.0|When I heard the name of this book... I was completely uninterested.<br /><br />Who needs cookbooks anymore?  There are endless free recipes online.<br /><br />It doesn't hurt to have one or two in your kitchen for easy reference... but I already have that.<br /><br />Then I heard Tim talking about some of the concepts around Meta Learning... and I figured I would give it a try.<br /><br />Short Version:  I Love This Book!<br /><br />If you are interested in learning faster, you won't be able to completely imagine how much it will speed up your results until after you have read it and applied it... and it is well worth it.<br /><br />What I didn't like:<br /><br />-Cooking is only a passing interest for me... and though this book has made it much more interesting (along with many related disciplines like hunting and butchering)... I'm much more interested in many of the examples Tim touches on.  I would love a more in depth look at rapidly gaining fluency in foreign languages.  I would love to see Tim's MED (minimum effective dose) suggestions for Thai Kickboxing, or other martial arts.<br /><br />-If you feel like you already want to 'learn everything'... this book will make it worse.<br /><br />What I liked:<br /><br />-Interesting and Exciting Recipes... that's right... it's actually fun to read this book... even the individual recipes.  I never had a cookbook that was anything more than a boring how-to manual.  This book is so much more than that... it is really a simple guide to getting a feel for cooking.  Tim spells it out and gives you a real understanding of the basics and plenty of room to grow.<br /><br />-Awesome information on Meta Learning... if you want to learn about how you learn, and you can learn more quickly/efficiently, this book is a must have.  Learning how to learn while you learn cooking.<br /><br />-Bacon infused Bourbon.  One word:  Win!<br /><br />-As I've grown to expect of all Tim's books, this one is going to kick your excuses right inthe baby maker.  When things are complex, start simple.  When the road is long, just focus on the next step.  At this point it gets really straightforward.  What do you really want to learn, and are you willing to learn it?<br /><br />All in all... a great book.
B008MZPVP4|5.0|definately delivers an all respecting performance from the current lineup, P. Anselmo is on point with an outstanding vocal performance!
B0096DFBZQ|3.0|love the game but like so many racing games it's a bit hard to steer, unless you have a tablet.
B00555X8OA|5.0|I am an arbitrator and mediator, so I am professionally very interested in how I and others think and make decisions. Kahneman's book shows how easily we all fall into certain mental &#34;traps&#34; and gives tools for getting out of them. Never dull,<br />this book will help you avoid making potentially serious mistakes in your decisions, and get you thinking about how all of us could make better decisions. Fascinating.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this game except that more games cost more coins (in the game). I need more words Grus sokdnbd dkbfbd
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I got this app for my three year old, but she wouldn't be able to figure out so I play it.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|Works great. won't use a controller without them. i did have one break though. the part that snaps around the trigger cracked do  to setting it down too hard. complete accident but just a heads up.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I've read  two other near death experience books and liked them, but this one moved me in a way the others did not.  I think the science behind the author's explanation is the reason.  The author is extremely intelligent, and sometimes his word choice and descriptions were tiresome and drawn out, but I just passed over that part.  My relationship with God and my faith has deepened has a  whole new magnitude of greatness after reading Eben's account of his NDE.  It's truly a life changer!!
1451695195|3.0|Bought this book for a friend who is deep into theology. Heard an interview on this book and decided it might be worth a look.
B009A9EPLM|5.0|Waiting for a new John Williams soundtrack is full of expectation. Growing up, I avidly collected the new releases of Jerry Goldsmith, John Barry Leonard Rosenman and John Williams with relish. Sadly only Williams is still with us and still composing. LINCOLN joins an impressive list of Presidential scores Williams has composed over the decades (JFK and NIXON). With WARHORSE, Williams seemed to be channeling Ralph Vaughan Williams. With LINCOLN it is Aaron Copland and the great legacy of American music. LINCOLN begins with a rich American score with a delightful opening theme on the clarinet that grows to full orchestral glory. I loved this score. Strangely, some reviewers didn't. Some were expecting elements of the Grand Master's earlier efforts. I look forward to ROBOPOCALYPSE!
B0063B2BNE|5.0|loved the shows clear video great sound had no problems with any of the shows not working and love having no commercials
B005ETA5K2|5.0|The SW didn't work on my Win7 64bit, but since I don't need it anyway, it is not a parameter for me.<br />I plugged it in the USB and Win7 recognised it, and immediately started functioning as I needed and hoped for.  I just love it.
B003L77GRO|2.0|This is a fine season of Dexter, but the DVD forces you to watch a Showtime promo at the beginning that CONTAINS DEXTER SPOILERS! You can't fast-forward, chapter-skip, or menu-skip during this promo set. I'm not sure if the broadcast version had this problem, but the color grading applied is obscenely orange in this season. Everyone looks like they just got a bad spray tan.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I know this series is old, but its good.  Truly classics and with the release of Prometheus it rekindled my desire to watch them again which sparked this purchase.<br /><br />The amount of extra bonus material you get with this is probably more than I will be able to watch in a long time.  If you love moves and enjoy the early films, then you need to get this one.
B009KZMFOA|5.0|I first heard the music of \\"Kaas Chante Piaf\\" at my friend's home. While I never heard of Patricia Kaas before I was captivated by her incredible voice and the beautiful arrangements of the Edith Piaf songs. I'm not only here to buy a copy her CD but also to recommend it to anyone who loves great music.
B00A2H9LK6|5.0|Like the other reviews said, it would have been a good idea to see the first movie if you want to understand this one, but thats the point of having a movie series.<br /><br />The first one, I thought wasnt scary at all but it was a great movie nothing the less.But since this review isnt about the first movie i wont really talk much about it.<br /><br />Silent hill revelations, Im going to admit, did go back and relate to everything, which is the back tracking, but it was doing it to explain everything from the first and connecting it. I personally liked it and enjoyed it. Silent hill revelations, the only fault I saw with this movie was it was a tad bit short. That was the only disappointing part of the movie.<br /><br />Other reviews were talking about how it does bring back part of the game its based off of which would be silent hill 3. Which is where the main character \\"heather\\" comes from. They do bring in the creepy rabbits, her vest, the emblem, and some of the creatures, with also adding new ones.<br /><br />When i went to see this, the first half the movie, i was creeped out, not gonna lie, i was gonna end up ripping the arm off the movie theater chair. But the 2nd half the movie, explains how it connects the second movie to the first movie, and relates into the game.  Although it does have parts of 2, where the father goes into silent hill.<br /><br />The movie overall is creepy and very good. I would highly reccomend this to anyone that is up for a creepy movie, but like any other series out there it would be a good idea to watch the first one before watching one.
B000YHG72E|5.0|I think this is one of Will Ferrell's best movies.  Put this movie on while decorating the living room and even just hearing parts of it had me dying laughing.  Highly recommend!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|The whole family enjoyed this film.  My 6 year old watched it 5 times in two days.  Great story, superb animation.  Highly recommend.
B0086700CM|3.0|Not too sure if this game is for me.  I picked it because my daughter wanted to play it and she likes it, but it's not my type of favorite game.
0547884591|5.0|This book is ingenious! Very detailed, easy to follow, lots of colored illustrations and most of all the recipes, look soooo good and healthy, I can't wait to try them. Tim Ferries's trilogy, the 4-Hour Work Week, the 4-Hour Body and now the 4-Hour Chef are my favorites of all time. So if you want to live healthy, wealthy and wise, these books are a MUST!!!
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Popular game enjoyed by all ages. Keeps your interest. Entertaining anywhere for anyone. Try it an you're certain to like it.
B009MF56GC|5.0|It is just as good as the first one. It has a lot of action ND THINGS BLOWING UP. aND A LOT OF VERY GOOD ACTORS ALL IN ONE MOVIE.
B005MIYI3K|5.0|We are big Nightwish fans, so it should be no surprise that we loved the album!  We love the sound of symphonic metal, and this album does not disappoint!
B000YHG72E|5.0|He is so funny in this movie. It kept me laughing all the way threw the movie. I thought it would be a kids movie but I was wrong.
B009157BWU|5.0|Beautifully photographed real animal story.  The writers gave the wild chimps names to help us along as we watch they're survival story.  Their faces and actions are so familiar, you can't help but feel for them and identify with these African chimps.
B009IQ0TGM|3.0|Good music but thought it would be better :/ but still going to the concert in January! The price was well worth it as well.
0743298020|5.0|I loved this story the first time I read it. I decided to buy it since it was one I thought I might reread at some point.
B0091LS07E|1.0|Very bland and dull. Haven't found any music so far worth listening too, was really hoping this would be better.
0143034901|5.0|I listened to this on audio book and loved it so much that I bought a copy for myself and for my granddad as a gift.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was amazing. We see great character development with the three main characters. This book turned a great first novel into a movement much larger than the yearly hunger games. It's saying the least when I say this book was a &#34;game changer&#34;.
B000I0QL82|5.0|Saw this several years ago and loved it so I decided to purchase a copy. Perfect holiday film for the whole family.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|The kids and I enjoyed the movie. We watched it twice in twenty four hours. I wish they had more movies that were made well like this one.
B00008DDSC|3.0|The storyline is definitely different. I thought the actors did a good job. Not sure I love the movie though.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Since we don't have a DVR, this was our only option for seeing last week's episode. Considering there are no shows I would pay by episode for, I willingly paid for this!! This season might even be better than last season!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I had seen all the movies before purchasing, but I had a great time seeing the all over movies again.
B0053O89KG|5.0|It's CASTLE!  what's not to love about it.  I really enjoy the show and will be purchasing the future seasons as well.  LOVE IT! LOVE IT!

B0086700CM|3.0|This looked like a fun game when I reviewed it before purchase. However, since it moves soooo fast, I haven't really gotten past the first level.  Might be the sensitivity on my tablet but I don't really choose to play it anymore.<br />Wouldn't purchase it or recommend it. Sorry to the developers. They thought it would be a good game.
0679805273|5.0|I gave this book to an ex for his graduation.  It was a great idea at the time.<br /><br />Now I'll gift it to my daughters and have their teachers sign it every year.  Imagine how neat she'll think that is when she graduates from high school.
B005G4TJUC|4.0|Bought it because it was part of the series and I really enjoy Shai LeBouf as an actor. Really liked him in Disturbia and in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (although the plot of that movie was pretty lame. but that's for another review.)  Disappointed with how they explained the absence of his true love, Mikeala, and why they broke up. For him to have a model as a girlfriend seemed a bit of a reach.  She lacked the toughness that spurred the character of Sam (Shai) to do great things.  This movie is on a scale of 1-10 about a 4 for story line and a 7 for action.  I still bought it but am kinda disappointed.
0757302661|5.0|I was afraid of the pain of childbirth.  But I'm more afraid of needles and hospitals in general.  I did major research before having my daughter, 3 1/2 years ago and ended up watching countless videos on youtube to see what worked for other women.  I came across a video of a woman who looked like she was completely calm and peaceful and she didn't make a peep.  She owed it to HypnoBirthing and I quickly found this book.<br /><br />What amazing and wonderful information in this book.  At the very least, it will give you a different way to think about childbirth.  Childbirth has been around for as long as humans have.  Think about how women used to do it before hospitals intervened.<br /><br />My book included a CD that literally to this day can still put me to sleep.  No, in a good way!  I have the worst time trying to relax and that CD does the trick, it's magic.  It really really made me work on the relaxation side of hypnobirthing.<br /><br />All of my friends and family are still amazed by my experience since I told them having my first baby (a 8lb 1oz girl born on her due date) was a &#34;piece of cake.&#34;  I've directed many of them to this book.  I've since had another child, and both were born completely naturally, even though I was in a hospital and did have a dr, not a mid-wife.<br /><br />This is the one baby book I don't regret buying!
B00991TCOG|5.0|I listen to and buy a lot of music. Between this and Ellie Goulding's Halycon they are the two biggest enjoyments of full albums from start to finish in years. Definitely a must buy for anyone that likes a modern take of classical  instrumentals mixed with the modern dubstep stylizations.
0887431453|5.0|I saw this at a pharmacy and found it cheaper on here, but of course.  I love that it really is &#34;BIG&#34; and thick, FULL of bright and attention grabbing colors, and that it keeps a good pace.  I let our 3 year old do as many pages as she wants to in a sitting.  It's nice that it doesn't jump all over the place.  Toddlers need practice and it gives a few pages of the same general concept, although it is still different and keeps the attention.<br /><br />I'm SO glad we got this!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|It does all you could ask of a battery app, and does it with great ease of use & pleasing graphics. Try it, you won't be disappointed.

B007TMON8M|4.0|I am having fun with this but not being an engineer or architect i find it is harder than i thought it would be and more of a challange. Sometimes I feel like I want to cheat and get hints, but there is no way to do that so I keep plugging along trying to support the damn dam.
B009FXIICK|4.0|I have tried to play this game on several devices, it works on most, but I noticed either slow loading of the title screen or not loading at all on older/low end devices. It works great on my Acer Iconia A1-810 tablet but not at all on a Coby Kyros 7042. It loaded a bit slowly but once up worked okay on an older Samsung Galaxy Centura but loaded quickly &amp; played perfectly on a Samsung Galaxy Discover which is essentially an updated version of the same phone. Considering it is a simple game with simple graphics, and isn't that big at 4.49MB, it should run on all of these devices without issue.<br /><br />The game itself is a match 3 where you need to get a certain number of each animal to level up. You have the option of normal game play or Tokoton where you have to catch 100 of an animal to level up. Once you pass level 6 the timer ticks down really quickly so you have to be fast to get to the next level. It helps if you don't wait for combos to finish before making the next move. Since this is an adaptation of a game that was originally for the Nintendo DX it can't exactly be called a copycat clone of other similar apps but its also not an original idea for a game.
1608871452|5.0|I just received this book today and have already thumbed through it a couple of times just cause I enjoy all the wonderful pictures that's packed into it.Just now getting ready to start reading it but have already fallen in love with it.This book is a must have for supernatural fans.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ever since the Pillars of the Earth I have regarded Follett as one of the best writers of contemporary English literature.  This book is a fine example of his literary skill.  In fact, it left me on the edge of my chair not wanted the novel to end and yearning for the last book in the trilogy. In addition to beautiful tightly written prose the research that was done to craft this outstanding historical novel was in depth and superb.  The characters came alive.  I read,listened, smiled, laughed, sighed and cried. The educational value of Follett's writing is another great attraction for me.  This particular book involved the rise to power of the despicable Nazi government, a subject about which I am particularly interested because I still cannot comprehend man's inhumanity to man both past and present. The book does not and cannot supply the answers but provide some additional perspective.  Follett is right there along side of Phillip Kerr for whom I also have a very high regard.
1423140605|5.0|I love this book. The product was sent on time and looked like new as expected and I would repeat service here agian. I had a great experience with the product.
B0017O1MIM|5.0|I have always been a sucker for epic films, and this film remains one of my favorite of all times (I actually like Lean's \\"A Passage to India\\" as well).  The characters are larger than life, the locations are immense, the themes are grand.  Oh, and who can forget the stunning music?  I wish that films like this were still made.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|Marware makes quality cases for Kindle, Kindle Fire and Kindle HD, among other products. This case is very well made and if you read some of the other reviews for this product, you will note how many times the word \\"sturdy\\" appears in the write-ups. It applies to my description, as well. This case has a hard plastic carrier inside that the Kindle snaps into securely. The carrier has tabs molded into its sides which fit into a series of slots made into the case. This allows a solid connection for the \\"easel\\" to be placed either horizonally or vertically and in three viewing angles. This is an improvement over my other Marware case for a Kindle Fire as the \\"easel\\" doesn't slide and fall over while on the angle you have chosen for the most comfortable viewing. Unique to the case the Kindle HD carrier swivels so you can watch a movie or read while laying on your side in bed. Very cool not to have to adjust my noggin' to some cramped position so I can use the Kindle; just set the angle with the \\"easel\\" tabs or swivel it to suit you needs. It stays where you put it. The case, when closed, covers the Kindle and gives complete coverage of the screen and tablet body. An elastic strap slips over the top to keep the case closed. Also, the case has a wide, soft elastic strap built into the inside back, so you can easily slip your hand into it to hold the Kindle while you read. This is a great feature becasue your hand doesn't tire out from gripping the case. Excellent quality, I recommend it.
B009FXIICK|3.0|this is a pretty solid match-3 game and it's fun in that regard. and the graphics are cute. unfortunately the time pressure makes this game less fun than it could be. also, the music is super-annoying and if you turn it off you are also turning off all sound effects, so you play in complete silence. it would be better if you could keep the sound effects on but have the music off, and/or have better music to begin with. i get that the music is in keeping with the retro theme, but in this case that isn't a good thing.<br /><br />it's nice to have a match-3 as the FAOTD, and this one is nice and simple with no ads or obvious bugs. but it probably won't stay on my device for long, because of the above-mentioned issues and also it is very predictable that around level 6 the timer goes too fast to be able to finish a round. then you just start over again, knowing it will be exactly the same each time.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This is one of those novels where you are constantly thinking what you might have done if faced with the same situation.  Lots of sympathetic characters...a gripping read!
B005NJU8PA|5.0|This book is a cook book, but not really.  It is a recipe (pun intended) to learning everything - fast!  It is all about Meta learning.  And Mr. Ferriss manages to convey it all in the shape of a cook book.  I am very excited about trying the newly discovered methodology on a number of things.  And I want to make some more of the recipes!<br /><br />Another entertaining volume from Tim Ferriss.  Highly recommended!

1401311083|5.0|I watched a bit of the tv show, almost two seasons of it, and I like the books much better.  The hugest difference is that the tv show decides to have the two key characters, the detective and the author, attracted to one another BUT it remains unrequited love, lust, romance, etc., The novels, by contrast, go for broke.  Rook, the writer, and Heat, the detective, very much become a couple in every way in the books although they do break up off and on too. This book reunites them after the most recent breakup. Rook was writing about NYC's most famous muckraking gossip columnist. When he finds her murdered, he calls the police and Heat and her team get the case. I've thoroughly enjoyed all of the Heat books and am looking forward to more of them. The relationship between Rook and Heat is what makes it.  Rook is at least as humorous on the page as he is in the series.  I just love him on the page.  I enjoyed him in the tv show but it wasn't the same. If you are a woman looking for a crime series, I think this is an especially good fit for you.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B005HJWWW8|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from this. I knew it would help with headphones that are harder to drive. I found that, with everyday headphones--I have Grado, Sennheiser, AKG, Panasonic. It boosts the volume, of course, but the benefit I hear is that it balances the music across the spectrum, giving you more of what you were meant to hear. It's not like a magic thing that will change your listening life, but it is definitely worth checking out at the price, because it does have an effect.
B00A72989U|5.0|I am a longtime Alicia Keys fan and just finished my first listen.  The album is amazing and highlights her growth, her introspection, and her diligence in the studio.  I do wish the sound was a bit cleaner overall, but that just may be how my speakers sound having not been fully charged.<br /><br />My favorite song right now is Brand New Me.<br /><br />Alicia, thanks for providing the catalyst for my heart to skip a beat when it hears simply amazing music (it's becoming rarer and rarer)!  I'll see you when you come to Atlanta.
0375850864|2.0|Did you ever read a book that was unsatisfactory, but you kept reading to see if it would turn around? For me, When You Reach Me By Rebecca Stead is that book. Don't let the colorful cover deceive you, this book is dull and not a all a page turner. The mash of mystery, love, sci-fi, and historical fiction was too excessive. I couldn't find any reason to like this book. Its really a boring, confusing,and mind-draining book.<br /><br />  This book is about a girl named Miranda, she's 12 and living in New York City in 1978. Her mother works as a paralegal in her boyfriend's law firm. Her mother just got on the game show $20,000 Pyramid, and Miranda and her mother's boyfriend, Richard, help her practice for the show. Miranda used had a best friend named Sal, after he got punched they stopped hanging out. After a week of loneliness Miranda meet Marcus, the boy who punched Sal, they kind of become friends. Also Miranda meets Annemarie when Julia stops being friends with. Miranda has a strange grudge against Julia that started in \\"...Second grade when we made self-portraits in art. She complained there was no \\"café au lait\\" - colored construction paper for her skin, or sixty-percent-cacao-chocolate\\" color for her eyes. I remember staring at her while these words came out of her mouth, and thinking, Your skin is light brown. Your eyes are dark brown. Why don't you just use brown, you idiot?\\".  For Miranda, Annemarie is taking Sal's spot in her heart per say. Then they meet Colin, the cute class clown, he gets them all a job at Jimmy's, the popular lunch hang out spot. At the same time Miranda receives notes from somebody, the first one asks where the apartment key is before she comes home and finds the apartment unlocked. The next couple of notes are addressed to her and ask her to write a letter about events yet to happen. Amongst the note confusion, Annemarie's ex-best friend tells Miranda that Annemarie has epilepsy while she has a seizure in school. Back to the note, Miranda gets a third note that tells her what's going to happen in the future, all of them do happen. Then the day before holiday break Sal spots Marcus, who also spots Sal, he wants to apologize for what he did and starts to walk towards Sal. Sal doesn't want a repeat of what happened when they met before so he sprints away. Marcus runs after him and then Miranda dashes after both of them. After 3 blocks of running Sall turns back while crossing the street, a truck is coming and Sal almost gets hit by a truck if it wasn't for the laughing man who kicked him out of the way. Following the laughing man death, Miranda starts to pick together the mystery. She realizes Marcus is the laughing man and all the notes make sense, Her mother ends up winning $20,000 Pyramid and she and Sal are friends again.<br /><br />  This book takes place in New York. I love New York in the present day. It is full of life and lights. In the book it doesn't capture the charisma, pizzaz and glamour of the city, it's 1978 and it seems like a suburban city. Theres no bustling cabs, actors walking down the street perfecting their craft, no boisterous, crazy noise from everyone going somewhere. Either she lives in a very protected neighborhood, which I don't think so, since the laughing man broke into her apartment, or the setting is just poorly described.<br /><br />  Miranda, Miranda, Miranda. A little 6th grader caught up in multiple love triangles. What is Rebecca Stead trying to teach kids? First it's Miranda and Sal forever, then she falls for Colin, the adorable goofball who Miranda and Annemarie work with. Colin and Annemarie seem like sweethearts, flitting in the sandwich shop. But Annemarie's Miranda's best friend. To finish it off, while Miranda and Sal are on the mend, it seems like Marcus, the bad boy who punches Sal, like Miranda . How many conflicts of inserts can you have?! All of this adds to the mass confusion of the book.<br /><br />  Time travel is a topic in the book and is loosely connected to the plot of the story. Miranda's favorite book is Wrinkle in time and it is talked about often, both books have time travel. While visiting Julia, Miranda spots \\"...my book's twin sister, just as old and beat-up-looking as mine\\" This book drops little hints about time travel, but nothing so subtle that while reading some will think if it as foreshadowing. Adding time travel to the plot honestly is another reason i dislike the book.<br /><br />  The other way time travel is connected is with the notes. The notes, and time travel are the hint of sci-fi in this book. Just a pinch of sci-fi makes me very confused, it's like she was indecisive about a genre. At first the notes interested me especially this one \\"...Second, please remember to mention the location of your house key.\\" After, she loses her apartment key. Before long, it just annoyed me because it made no sense and didn't impact the future that much when she didn't put the clues together.<br /><br />  I didn't enjoy this book. All the different elements were loosely tied into the plot, and the melting pot of genres just doesn't taste well. In the ending, everything comes together but I went through the entire book in confusion. I wish there were more relatable characters, a concrete genre, and a better plot and morals.I don't like sci-fi so it just wasn't my cup of tea. I have to give it a low rating of a 2 out of 5.<br /><br />2 out of 5
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|this game is easy to figure out and play. storyline is not terrible original, but oh well.wont take too long to clear, we will see. better than standing in a line with nothing to do.
0061474347|5.0|This is my favorite genre to read and it has everything a reader is looking for. It had a lot of action and never lost its pace. I hate it when books take 20 pages to get to its point and Nix definitely doesn't do that. I read this one first by accident, but I just ordered the rest of the old kingdom series and can't wait to read it... still finishing another book. I would highly recommend it for anyone who likes sci fi, magic, etc. One of my favorite authors.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Over 2,500+ reviews and the ratings are still 5/5 stars. I spent many hours in the early AM reading this book because I could not put it down. This book is that good. I don't think I could say what hasn't been already said by those 2,100+ 5/5 star reviewers other than: I love this book, this series. So, buy this series, you won't regret it. Great characters and a great storyline.
B009LL4LMM|5.0|wish it where longer I finished it in no time but fun fun fun. even my kids loved this one very cute.
B005LAIHYU|4.0|Quite an entertaining film despite what you may think of the premise.  The director is no stranger to vampire films, having directed Night Watch and Day Watch.  All the actors are chosen well and the acting is excellent.  Lots of action and special effects make it less cheesy than you might think.  Apart from the vampires, the film is fairly historically accurate, which makes it all the more entertaining.<br /><br />The movie does take a few liberties, starting with the premise that Lincoln was a vampire hunter.  The vampires as well buck the well entrenched premise that they are destroyed by sunlight.  Instead, vampires in this movie are killed using silver, which is normally the weapon of choice for werewolves.  Don't expect anything highbrow, just relax and enjoy the ride.

B0073LWEXK|5.0|I wish they made more games like this, for those of us who miss Myst, 7th Guest and Rhem there just aren't a lot of click and point puzzle adventure games.

For those of us who don't like shooting things and like to use our brains, this is a great game.

B0041KVW2K|1.0|To say I was looking forward to what claimed to be a world class effort on the part of the studio is an understatement. To say I was totally bummed out after going through 2 box sets is also an understatement. It honestly broke my heart to send the second set back. Unlike some other reviewers, I thought the sonics were for the most part exceptional. I compared a number of these LPs to MOFI pressings, original US pressings, original European pressings (UK, France, Germany) as well as to the stereo CD remasters from a few years ago.<br /><br />I confess to being an audiophile and, as I'm sure you've gathered, the consummate Beatles freak as well. I have an exceptional Hi Fi system and listen to music critically. The bottom line is that these pressings are at best variable and at worst, terrible. Some of the vinyl literally looked pebble-grain. Some looked  like an uneven slurry. Some had white dimples, looking as if oil had gotten on the surface as the vinyl cured. The hole is Sgt. Pepper was so off center that the final note on side 2 was totally warble-y with the most god awful crunch right as it was really fading out. The lead in edge on a couple had a 3/8 inch chunk out of the edge so I had to be very careful putting the stylus on the record for fear of destroying my cartridge.<br /><br />The really sad part is that I liked the way the albums sounded. Yes, they are from digital masters however the sound was warm, extended and had many nuances that the others didn't. Frankly, they made the originals LP's sound muffled and the recent CD's sound harsh and lo resolution. No doubt due to the 24 bit mix rather than the 16 bit that was used for the CD's. If only they could have had the pressing quality of the MOFI discs. These were so quiet I really couldn't hear any indication that I was playing a record. Too bad the MOFI discs are going for north of $300 on ebay.<br /><br />Bottom line, I hope that EMI/Capitol/Sony or whomever realizes the damage they have done to what seems to have been a huge effort and go to RTI to have some real quality pressings made.seems to have been a huge effort and go to RTI to have some real quality pressings made.

B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Its an aw some book about a guy well I'll tell you later don't want to give anything away but seriously if you want to read a story that's funny this is the book for you!!!
B005M2A4DE|5.0|Doctor Who is one of the best BBC has put out. Great box set..looking forward for the full season 7 to come out in 2013
B009FXIICK|1.0|this game has been out as the FAOTD for 10 whole minutes and there are already 12 reviews dated today raving at how wnderful this app is. when it hasn't been out long enough for anyone to actually play the game and give an honest review these are abvious from the dev (and friends) who knew ahead of time that this would be the FAOTD. if this game is really so good then letting it stand on its own merits from true reviewers should be enough. personally I'll  wait for the reviews from people like jjceo who actually play the game and give full and honest reviews. (BTW thank you jjceo. your reviews help us all decided whether some of these apps are worth even a try.)<br /><br />it also seems suspicious that there are NO permissions listed in the product info, but according to the photos there are links for facebook and twitter. both would require one or more internet permissions. if this is something that was previously included but deleted in an update then you might want to update the phoros as well. yet another reason to wait for the true and honest review of jjceo.
1442359315|5.0|You know it's true when you read it!!! You just can't make this up.Proof of heaven was wonderful and up lifting.
B0048KXRR6|2.0|The Story was very good, the actors were good, but the picture size wouldn't fill the screen. On a HD TV, it was letter boxed, even with zoom function it didn't fill the vertical width of the screen.  Watching on my computer 16 X 9 monitor screen, it left large gaps between the top and bottom of the Monitor screen, when zoomed to full screen.
B008Y1YFNU|3.0|Not unlike their last album a slolid rock compilation but give me the old Papa Roach any day of the week. Well the old Jacoby especially
B0013F1D02|5.0|... with a GREAT sense of humor. Stardust creates, bit by bit, a magical world that exists in parallel to and connected with our own. Things start off a little slow because the director/writer lay solid groundwork for the storyline and characters.<br /><br />I enjoyed this so much that I watched it a second time just 1 week later with my girlfriend.
B008Y2IU12|5.0|Awesome movie with great graphics..love the twist on the snow white theme.  All the actors are great...this is a definite buy.
B009VB97EY|1.0|the acting was awful, I couldn't even finish the movie. Bad! and very bad. would not expect it to be that bad
B00881VLCE|5.0|I adore this app. Jigsaw puzzles are great but there must be lots of people like me who don't want to get them out and make a mess all over a surface you will probably need before you finish.  This app is as close to the real thing as you can get and there are tons of free and low cost puzzle packs so you never run out of new puzzles to assemble.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This was a difficult book to read in many ways, because it seems so real, as if you are yourself experiencing the symptoms and not just reading about Alice.  The author has a gift for presenting perspectives other than the main character while not shifting perspectives either.  It is really a wonderful book, well-written and hard to put down.
B003TH14H4|5.0|Great acting.  He's funny and she's in love.  Stana looks at him in a way men would kill for.  I do like the mix with his fsmily at home.
B009CPEOC4|5.0|I am a middle-aged man who grew up listening to heavy metal and punk rock music.  I saw this movie and loved it.  Katy Perry is really a great artist and very inspireing and her music is really beyond any genre of popular music.  It made me happy and full of joy and inspiration to watch this, I highly recommend it to anyone reguardless of their age or background.
B008N1LL42|4.0|I liked this movie..great graphics!! Wasn't sure but glad i watched it. Great family movie or for some loud action.
B005LAII94|5.0|I loved this movie, great characters and a great story.. A must watch. Can I say sequel. Keep it for my collection
B009CPEOC4|4.0|Interesting look into a super star's life, and seemed down to earth and real.<br /><br />I'd recommend it, if you have any interest in Katy Perry or international pop super stars.
B006PHD0RW|4.0|my kids put this game on my kindle and now it is harder and harder to put down. it is fun and entertaining. I play it all the time.
B005V4FJC4|3.0|More of a contemporary holiday music collection, I was looking more for holiday music from the 1960's. I play it at my work desk.
0061339202|5.0|This book was life-changing for me. The research behind flow is fascinating and I highly recommend all of Dr. Csikszentmihalyi's books.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Really enjoyed this book, the writing style was unique and it kept me up to read &#34;one&#34; more page!  Looking forward to reading other Flynn novels.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|What can I say.. AWESOME I loved the Characters, I was totally on the edge of my seat watching the moves.. WOW
B009S8PEHY|5.0|Modern renditions of classics plus new fun Christmas music.  Loved the duets  The download is so easy, and I could start enjoying the music immediately.  I have always loved Rod Stewart's music and this album is a great Christmas mix.
B008IJTFYW|3.0|seems to have a problem on the of.but when it is working rather pleasant. not sure it makes a difference with the sleeping issue but only used one night and its free
B004GAY2GS|5.0|this selection was nice and one of his earlier ideas on a solo carrer, but turned into the &#34; A&#34; alblum, worth getting for the collector
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I enjoy playing this game to help unwind, so far most of the levels have been pretty easy, but I have been stumped once or twice for a few minutes.
B000FBFM9S|5.0|I read the reviews on this book when it was first released, and I just had to buy a copy.  Great story--I loved it.  Zadie is a genius at storytelling.
B009F879HK|5.0|Bellissima idea quella di far uscire un 45 giri di Love Me Do per il 50° anniversario. Non può mancare nella discoteca di qualsiasi appassionato della musica dei Beatles. Io ne ho comprato due copie ! Pensare che è tutto iniziato allora ! Buon divertimento e saluti a tutti i Beatlesiani.
B005FUJNNU|5.0|I love the books &#34;Alice in Wonderland&#34; and &#34;Alice Through the Looking Glass&#34; but must admit that I'm absolutely a fan of this twist on both stories. Using the poem &#34;Jabberwocky&#34; as the basis for this version was inspired. Having Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter was just icing on the cake.
B009B8YZIK|5.0|I'm surprised they're coming out with a retail release of this because I thought it was on youtube only. But I'll be picking it up to show some relatives. It's as good as any big budget sci-film and will leave you wanting more. I'm not a fan of Halo and never played, but if you like sci-fi films you will enjoy
B000E5L89S|5.0|great alblum and music , this was one of the last things so far from david gilmour before gnask lp, and the end of richard wrights life just weeks before gnask was issued. live at the albert hall was great also, but this alblum is a piece of perfection !!!!
B000NU2CY4|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time.  If you love action and the roman period, this movie is a must.
B008NEVP1S|2.0|Where did all the talent go? \\"Snoozer\\" .. errr., I mean \\"Charmer\\" is Aimee Mann's latest album that seems designed, engineered and over-produced with the goal being a dedicated SiriusXM station that can play on autoloop at your nearest Gap (or even Banana Republic) store. The composition is simple to a fault, four chords in convenient succession and only on a couple of tracks do we even hear Aimee's fretwork on bass. The lyrics are simple and rhyme nicely and the hooks are convenient and make all the tracks seem familiar.  In short, a snoozer.  After suffering through this a few times I played Aimee's tracks from \\"Magnolia\\" and 'Til Tuesday's \\"Everything's Different Now\\" (dated now, sure, but at least it is *good*) and wondered what happened? Is she just phoning it in or did she completely lose her extraordinary talent? <sigh>
B00006K0WX|5.0|I can't wait for this to come in the mail! It's really cool and i cant wait to play with it! Thanks!:)
B009NQKPUW|5.0|This was an very well done prequel to the film &#34;Alien&#34;. After viewing in 2D we had to purchase the 3D version just because some of the scenes already seemed to be 3D. I know that many people don't like CGI, but in this case it was just the backdrop for a good story with good acting.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|For years I have wanted to read this book, but untill Kindle came along I was not able to,., for one reason or another. Mainly because I was too lazy to go get the book. Thanks to Kindle I am now reading it (as well as many other classics) and am devouring it page by page. Now I know why these books are called 'the Classics'. I am about 1/3 of the way through and am cheering for Jean Valjean and Cosset to finally come to a happy ending.
B000SEGUDE|1.0|It makes no sense, it's impossible to follow, the stories aren't interesting enough to keep reading.  And now I've let too much time pass and I can't get my money back.  I'm only 8% into the book and can't even imagine continuing and I read all of the Game of Thrones books!  And I hated them, too, but at least there was a story.<br />Oh well - I fell for the Tom Hanks/Halle Berry movie trailer - at least I won't waste my money on the movie.  Sheesh - Penny Marshall and Cloud Atlas at the same time. I must be losing my mind..........
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|If you have ever heard or seen any batman movies, but have not yet watched Christopher Nolan's trilogy of the batman series.  You are missing out.  By far the best batman movies ever!!
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Good game I would reccomend people to try it. simple easy to plsy game. i like it. I like it
B009FXIICK|5.0|Played this for hours on my ds! Works great on the kindle too. I love how the animals get mad if you don't match them!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|just love the books from jodi picoult. as always a great read from this autor. looking forward to next one
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|I was thrilled to find this game for my kindle fire! Unfortunately after about a week or two, there was some kind of update or something and I have been unable to play the game since. Each time my character performs any type of polnts action, the game closes and starts over again. I tried to get tech assastance but could not get an acct. set up...it kept telling me the security letters I was asked to duplicate didn't match (yes they did). Don't  get hooked on this game, it may stop working after you have invested lots of time to it.
0470913029|4.0|Learning a great deal about good and bad foods.  Amazed at how supposedly good foods such as dairy products affect you.  Having fun at the supermarket just browsing the shelves for inspiration from the book.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|I'm a fan of Michael Connelly and the Harry Bosch books and this one is my favorite.  Good read and sufficiently complex plot.
B009VB9VKY|1.0|Phony stilted acting.  Adolescent plot.  Didn't pass a basic requirement: no one I could like, so I didn't care. Didn't merit even one star, but I couldn't erase the star.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|If your taste includes the &#34;dames&#34; of British theater, and an interesting plot, you'll probably love this movie. I laughed - and cried - and thoroughly enjoyed it.
0345803485|5.0|i still havent had a chanced to read the book. but as soon as i get a chance i will start reading
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I needed a PDF reader for my tablet and downloaded for free. It works fine like you'd expect Adobe reader to work.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|Good game for a beginner.I enjoyed the slow but steady progression in diffulculty.The only thing I didn't like was how small the cubes got as you progressed. It was hard on the eyes.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I am a Vince Flynn fan and preordered this book. It was delivered on the release date and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it!
B00002SSKI|5.0|Classic movie. a movie you can watch over and over again. it will never get old to me. i love it.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this app I'm so glad they have it now! Its one of the best games ever. You basically just run jump slide under things and get to I think 3 different levels. 1st level gold coins. 2nd level red and gold coins. 3rd level blue and gold coins.
1451648537|5.0|You learn a great deal about Steve Jobs, his talents and his vision.  Especially how great products come before profits.  I've now bought a copy for my employees and they love it.  It's a great read.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|I downloaded this for a new pad I bought and it is working really great plus you can't beat free!
B009VSW15Y|5.0|I was thinking of downloading so I could use the camera but I use it<br />Skype.  My son is stationed in Guam and we skype on my Kindle.  I would like to take pics though.  I don't know which one to buy. Any ideas?
B009S8PEHY|5.0|My family and I were listening to this album and it put us in the Christmas mood and spirit!  I enjoy listening to Rod Stewart and this album is perfect for the holidays!  You will love it!
B000053VAZ|5.0|I love this movie. They all do excellent in their parts.<br />Johnny Depp is just an amazingly gifted and talented person. He does well in all his movies.
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|The packaging for this is lovely. The front is slightly holographic. I'm excited about having the digital copy, blue-ray, AND DVD.
B0077EBWVI|1.0|Anyone who thinks this is a good remake should be committed.  The acting is a joke.  The Preacher is pathetic and weak, not a domineering presence like in the first one.  Ariel is self centered and uninteresting.  Chuck is barely even a rival, and Ren is impossible to empathize with as he comes off as disrespectful and unnecessarily cocky, like a lot of kids nowadays.  This movie is like watching a poorly directed bubble gum commercial, and would actually make a great example of what not to do in a movie, as though they've basically stuck with the original storyline, the scenes utterly lack the poignant moments and emotions of the first one, and the dialogue just tries to explain the story so much that it is terribly unrealistic, unlike the first one.  It's a good indication of what ridiculous taste this country has now, as it really seems to have no heart and soul like the first one did.  It's sad to see that people don't know the difference.
0307361012|5.0|I admit that I've been all over the map as to the order in which I have read this great Norwegian crime writer's works. What has saved me from too much frustration in understanding how the character of Inspector Harry Hole evolves over time is that each of his novels in this series, ranging from this one to \\"Phantom\\", contains a rattling good psychological thriller with all the elements of suspense, horror and human conflict a reader would want. This particular book has finally been translated into English so we get to see how Hole(Holy)starts his fictional journey as a Norwegian detective assisting the New South Wales police investigate the unsolved murder of a Norwegian cocktail waitress working in Australia. While this assignment has initially all the appearances of a holiday in paradise, the reader quickly recognizes that Hole has a serious challenge on his hands over and beyond the normal cultural adjustments: the police Down Under are not quite prepared to handle a murder investigation that could involve a serial killer who is adept at killing young blondes and staying one step ahead of the hunt. his psychopath knows who really is in charge and will only communicate with Hole, which puts him in extreme danger much of the time. This search for the killer is baffling and dramatic to say the least, with plenty of close calls and blood-curdling moments. To intensify matters even more and avoid Hole becoming simply a stock character, the author lays on some other personal dimensions for our consideration: Hole's intimate and cozy relationship with a Nordic lady he has met at the bar; a tenuous and troubled friendship with a young aboriginal cop; and numerous references to the powerful hold that aboriginal mythology over the land. In the end, the power of Hole's character will take over because he is the one person who is consumed with the need to bring the killer to justice for what he did to this innocent fellow Norwegian. He cannot stand idly by and let this search drag on without ultimately taking charge. Like in all of Nesbo's novels, the price for getting involved at this level is high. It exposes one to the danger of pitting oneself against the killer, and we learn very quickly how up to the task he is. The mark of any competent fictional writer like Nesbo is that the significant events throughout the plot have a critical role to play in its conclusion.ch drag on without ultimately taking charge.

B006LSZECO|4.0|The author told a story of suspense that kept me turning pages until 1:30 in the morning. However, I felt there was way too much gratuitous vulgar language that was not only distracting but unrealistic.  Was there a purpose in having Nick's sister say to him, \\"If I had a d--k I would use it to eat peanut butter.\\"  Really??  That is just one example of verbiage that added nothing to the story line and could have been eliminated.  If you can get past the vulgarity, it was an interesting story. But why should you have to \\"get past\\" the language???
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Holy lord, did I ever love this book.<br /><br />I picked up the Omnibus edition because I'd heard some chatter about it on some SFF book blog (I wish I remembered where), and though it took me a while to whittle down my to-be-read shelf, once I got to it, I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />I felt as though I could see the movie playing out in my head while reading Wool. The description was clear and uncluttered and incredibly effective. Every character I encountered was interesting and engaging. I remember being especially thrilled by the older characters' love story - how often does one see that sort of relationship in scifi?<br /><br />And then Juliette - her character was absolutely fantastic and grounded in her own reality. In her first appearance, I was immediately reminded of the giant machines in the silent film Metropolis. As she deals with the foreign world of the top levels, I love that she kept going back to metaphors that a mechanic would think of - nuts and bolts, levers and pumps.<br /><br />Lukas was a breath of fresh air, too. Star charting IT geek? The Romeo and Juliet analogy didn't bother me a bit, as it was so apt and yet also an approach I hadn't seen recently, a cross-class romance that was also about bringing those very classes together.<br /><br />As a SFF geek, this was total crack. The plots were tight and well-researched, and kept me reading long after I should have gone to bed.<br /><br />Only one bit confused me (mostly as someone who has done plenty of electrical work, but none underwater). I won't detail it here since I don't like spoiling people, but I'm guessing my concern is addressed in a bit that got skimmed as I was desperately trying to find out what would happen!<br /><br />I'll be picking up this guy's backlist, and recommending it to anyone I know who reads SFF.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|works perfectly on my kindle fire, I can considering the upgraded version for more options even though the free version has so much to offer
B005LAII08|5.0|ordered and it was delivered the next day.  Awesome.  will recommend this to anyone.  Can't wiat to watch it with my daughter who has it on her Santa list
B00A7ZXPSM|3.0|nothing jumped out as a great song on the album but i thought it was an improvement from the last one.
B0046MOVD0|5.0|For the price a very sweet deal. have had it for 2 months now and no problems. would buy again from this company
B008WCP2PG|5.0|One question: Why the heck wasn't this made in IMAX 3D?!!!!!! lol OMG! You can totally tell that Channing has some experience in the male \\"dancing\\" industry! He's definitely a pro! To the people complaining about the story line and all that...lighten up, sit back, and enjoy the eye candy! Geesh. The last thing I cared about was the story line! haha

B0083SBJXS|2.0|The packaging was damaged. The movie showed up way later then expected. Just overall wasn't impressed with service. Wish I would of bought somewhere else, could of got a better deal.
B003E88TKS|4.0|It's not a romantic comedy but it has some of that vibe.  It's not Character driven drama but it has some of that.  It's not just an excuse for George Clooney to be really cool in a movie again but it has that too.  Up in the Air is a comedy, a character study piece, and a really entertaining film.  George Clooney plays a man who works for a company that other companies hire out to do their &#34;downsizing&#34; for them.  Basically he comes in and actually tells people that they are fired.  In the economic environment we are in right now, it's the business to be in.  Clooney's character is much more at home on a plane and in a hotel room than he is in the small, hotel room like, apartment that he spends a few days a year in.  A young woman, played by Anna Kendrick, fresh out of college joins the company with the idea that they could save a lot in travel expenses if they did their work by computer using web-cams.  The boss, played by Jason Bateman, sends her out with Clooney's character so she can experience what the job entails so she can create the new system that will keep the employees at home and not on the road.  Clooney's character is at home on the road and he, of course, hates the idea of being stuck in one place.  During his travels he meets a beautiful co-frequent flyer, played by Vera Farmiga, and they strike up an opportunistic &#34;relationship&#34;.  This is the closest thing he's had to a real relationship and he begins to rethink his definition of what happiness is.  He's somewhat estranged from his family but is forced to face his family commitment at his sister's wedding.  Anna Kendrick's character basically has the opposite problem.  She wants and needs close relationships and finds that wearing your emotions too close to the outside can be difficult in her new line of work.  This movie works on every level.  It's funny, touching, and thought provoking all at once.  There are a lot of set ups for what look to be cliche' moments that turn in unexpected directions, thank goodness.  We are all pretty sick of the cliche's.  How many times can you watch someone running through an airport because they've found &#34;the one&#34; and don't want to lose them?  Well there is a similar scene here but not with the outcome we are used to seeing.  Again, thank goodness.  It's an original film that still has that comforting feeling of relatability.  There will be at least one character you can relate to and that always helps draw me into a film.  I was suckered into Up in the Air and I wholeheartedly recomend it.cted directions, thank goodness.

0316228532|1.0|Clearly, Little Brown was intimidated by Rowling's stardom and failed to critically edit her work.  With nearly 30 characters introduced in as many pages, there is no development or distinction to any.  The dialogue, written in some form of British local dialect, is difficult to understand and requires slow reading to figure it out. The plot develops ever so painfully slowly...to the point where the reader seriously considers calling it quits numerous times. Save your money...save your time. So many excellent books to read, including the Harry Potter stories....but this is definitely not one.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love that it syncs with my Kindle so I can use either one to read, and I don't have to keep finding my page everytime I want to switch.  They both sync to my iPod Touch so I'm never without my book.  This is so great for traveling so I don't have to haul my 700 books around with me.  Initially, it was very difficult to get it to download to my android tablet, but after that was done, I've had no problems.  Beware of off brand android tablets that don't allow you to use Google Play.
