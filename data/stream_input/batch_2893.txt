1616550414|5.0|This is the most amazing Zelda read I have ever had. It contains just about everything a Zelda fan would love. Yes...it is aimed more toward Skyward sword, but what it lacks in some games, it gains in the timeline. Finally a timeline has been brought forth by Nintendo. Amazing!
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|But not great either. Felt like Running Man with teenagers. I can see why 12 year olds love this movie.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|A bit annoying having to wait for energy levels so often not enough crystals to make the game flow but enjoyable and good for a free app
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|Absolutely terrific!  Mia Wasikowska is captivating as Jane Eyre and gives the best performance of any Bronte heroine I've seen on film.  Her portrayal is both fierce and heartbreaking.
B000U6BT40|3.0|This is a good program to watch when you are in the mood for something not very deep or serious.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Where to start?<br /> if you were ever a Sherlock Holmes fan in any way, this is a fun new take on the modern day version,. Takes place in London, Era: now.<br /> Lots of fun banter between He and Dr. Watson and the S.H. personality is well . . . 'explained', I suppose is the way to say it.<br /> highly recommended. Enjoy!
B00008J2PG|4.0|Hollywood makes this politcal above religious which it isn't and makes the Pope Pius XII seem as if he didn't try to save anybody but the Truth is that there was no single person that saved more Jews (900,000) than Pope Pius XII during WWII and there were many Jewish converts to Catholicism as a result and even the highest Jew in Rome (The Chief Rabbi) converted to Catholicism and his quotes to the proof that Pius XII saved the Jews fly in the face of the AntiCatholic Media that hates the memory of Pius XII and Catholicism.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|This movie followed the book pretty good, it provided lots of excitement and lessons of what government can degenerate into with absolute control of its people.
B000E1MXSW|4.0|It shows to seriousness of the Call to the Holy Life of the Nun and the responsibility if one doesn't try to be a 100% devoted nun and leave the attachments of the world behind.  It is very in depth but still Holywood protrayal of a nun's life as hard and unhappy which is far from the Truth...unless the nun is lukewarm like this one and then there is no peace in the Soul.  Great movie to get an inside look of Traditon that now is almost nonexistent in the convent with the Masonic/Protestant revolution of Vatican 2.
B00E978FGQ|4.0|We like'd this film well enough. Magic well done is always great to watch. Would see again, definitely not a waste of time or money.
B00881VLCE|3.0|I enjoy games on the Kindle, but this one is rather unchallenging. I do like jigsaw puzzles though and would try others out.
0812550706|5.0|Author Mr. Card is an excellent writer in my opinion.<br />Reading it again to be able to be tuned into the movie<br />when it shows.  Can't wait.  Shipping very satisfaction<br />& doing business with Amazon.com is sooo easy &<br />convenient.  Thanks.
B002ZG98J6|5.0|I first watched the lightning thief in the theater. I was not sure there would be more movies for the other books. I look forward to more movies from this wonderful series of books.
B00A8FXT8M|5.0|I found this book remarkable for the way it made ordinary events - an unwise marriage and its deterioration, a loving love affair and the vagaries of work - so riveting.  A quiet truthfulness pervaded the pages and made it easy to identify with the people and events.  A very good read.
B00E0MCYPS|4.0|My review is focused on my kids point of view so adjust your expectations accordingly. Kids are both under 7 years old. Game was not easy for them to control, it's hard to keep the car on the track and for them to tilt the tablet while pressing the gas. They played it for a few minutes and didn't seem interested in playing again. An older child / adult may enjoy this more.<br /><br />Graphically the game seems pretty decent and given time they / I might enjoy it. I played it a few laps and although I started getting the hang of it it wasn't the easiest. I didn't like how much slower the grass made you (especially given you are driving on a dirt road when on the road) but I understand there has to be motivation to stay on the road.<br /><br />I don't play a lot of racing games on the tablet so my perspective is fairly narrow.
B00821OX98|4.0|Good story, good special effects and pretty decent acting.<br />Some of the decisions they make have me rolling my eyes.<br />Looking forward to the coming seasons
B008469DGY|5.0|I have to say my expectations were pretty low when I tried this game out. Golfing on the tablet seemed like a train wreck waiting to happen. I started the game and played it while showing my boy how. I enjoyed it very much and almost didn't want to give the tablet back.<br /><br />You shoot the ball with your finger, then control it's path by flicking forward, backwards, left and right and that adds a ton to the fun. The holes so far all seem to be single shot holes and all have a reasonable chance at a hole in one.<br /><br />I expect to be playing this game a lot in the coming weeks and recommend it.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|The length ads the ability to move around and for my kids to play without ripping the chord out of the wall.
B00CO4KGYA|5.0|This is a solid game, reminds me a lot of angry birds (not a bad thing). I've only played a handful of levels so far but I enjoy it thus far.<br /><br />If you like Angry Birds you should like this.
B00EOFIYZA|5.0|I love her so much and with these extra tracks, I know for a sure she's the best artist in the world.
B000IZBP56|3.0|It's okay. Story moves too quick and does not really follow the book. Wasted actors talents. I was really hoping for more.
B0045HCJQW|4.0|The film itself is great.  It is the movie I watch when I am sick, or when I have had a bad day, or when I have had a great day.  I cannot put into words what I love about it, It just has something.  The only problem is, this particular copy will not work in my DVD player.  It is probably my DVD player, however I don't have any other problem with any other DVDs I have.  I would send it back, but I didn't pay very much for this copy, so I am probably better off just buying a different copy.  Less hassle that way.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|So this is a fun addicting game...but my son (4 yrs) wanted to get the mom character....so after lots of time and runs I finally collected enough bananas to get her...150,000 of them... but at that point they switched the price to $15 in real money/coins with nothing else left to buy with bananas....which makes the game useless.
B005PK57IK|5.0|How the writers keep coming up with terrific legal plots and yet keep you guessing as to the Love Triangle going on is just genius. And, if you're not familiar with Christine Baranski's acting ability, you'll be happy to know her
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Well done period piece incorporating real historical events (e.g. WWI, Spanish Flu, the Titanic) in the story lines. Full of hidden treasures that jump out at people who know, such as a clever French phrase used under one's breath at the proper moment during dinner or talk about investing with some American investor by the name of Ponzi. Every episode is a delight in spite of some very tragic moments. Nice introduction to what it must have been like living in a class society.
0694011479|4.0|My daughter really likes all the Eric Carle books. Although he's had a few misses (The Angry Ladybug!), this one was cute and we both like reading it.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|In looking for the Historical Jesus Mr. Aslan discounts many of the stories that show Jesus is God come to earth.  He gives short shift to the stories of the virgin birth and had Mary being possibly raped by a Roman soldier. He does not question Jesus being a healer and exorcist because the Jewish priests do not question them but does say that there were many such at that time.  Mr. Aslan has Jesus as one of many that claimed to be the Messiah during this period of Jewish history, but does not accept him as the only real Messiah.  And interesting read for any Christian since he will challenge your beliefs while providing you data about Jewish history that you do not get from just reading the Bible.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Very good book. Would recommend it. Close to fifty shades but not quite. Hope the next book comes out soon.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I tried to up date program and it took away all of my progress so I am not very happy
B008469DGY|5.0|Fun and easy to learn and I don't even play golf.  Graphics ok as well.  Worth the purchase though I got it for free.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|My kids are die hard minion lovers.  When the second one came out they watched this one so much that I have had to replace it!!
B008IBPMZG|5.0|If you haven't started watching this show, do yourself a favor and tune in! This show is so well made, it's like enjoying a slice of perfect pie after dinner, a treat to be savored!
B007THA4FI|4.0|I am not normally a fan of the English novel but this drew me in with complex characters and a marvelous setting.  These people are flawed and muddling through their circumstances which makes them interesting.  I picked this up because it was written by J. K Rowling but after the first chapter, I forgot all about that and just enjoyed the story.
B00942Y4IY|5.0|Very entertaining. Enjoyed the story and the characters were played well. How did those people, on that moon, eat? Oh well, it was a good idea.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It has been a long time since a book had me on the edge of my seat! I felt all the emotional and physical highs and lows of the characters. I am looking forward to the rest of the series.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft one amazing game buy this app it's playing none stop you always have something to do so this is one of the best games EVER
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Not as good as either The Kite Runner or A Thousand Splendid Suns.  This one seems to jump around in time too much and it's hard to keep track of all the characters and how they relate to each other.  Still, a good read.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Very entertaining. Chris Pine has embodied the Capt Kirk I grew up with.  All the characters bring back memories of my childhood.
B008602KQI|5.0|I cant in my 52 years remember a story like this. It was a refreshing departure from the formulaic plots that are so prevalent these days. It was a dark story and one that made you think about how human nature remains the same over time and many changes. If you want to ponder some deeper philosophical musings on human nature then this is a flick for you.
B0012GMUPE|5.0|One of my all-time favorite albums! Clarke's funky bass is simply the best! As great to listen to now as it was when it first came out, back when it was still on vinyl.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Fantastic read. Riveting and captivating at the same. Lisbeth Salander is not your everyday protagonist but the author still skillfully made the reader love and respect her. Overall good read.
B00DAXXO98|5.0|Acting was great. Story line suspenseful. Can hardly wait for next season. Compares to Downton Abbey, with a smaller cast of characters.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|this book was just as moving and inspiring as I expected. I highly recommend it and will read it again
039334505X|3.0|I Loved Welsh's work when I was younger, have several UK first editions. Trainspotting was amazing.  Welsh excels at creating relationships between \\"mates\\" who pick on, tease, and care for each other because \\"he's a mate and all.\\"  I've never really been impressed with his female characters. If you're a Trainspotting fan, you already know that Begbie is a violent psychopath, Sick Boy is selfish, Spud is sweet but not clued-in, and Renton is a bit complicated.  Skag Boys doesn't really offer much new material - we already know how Renton felt about his younger brother, that Sick Boy is s smooth-talking ladies' man, etc. I gave the book 3 stars because it was sort of fun to hear the guys rip on each other again, but we know this story.<br />  This is a review of the audible version -- Tam Dean Burn was excellent as always - i'd highly suggest trying an audio version of Welsh's work to readers who have difficulty with the printed dialect.
B003XDUCIG|5.0|this is a great book, explaining  all the hows and whys of cooking. It has lots of recipes, but the main point is to explain what actually happens when you cook. I really like understanding of the science behind cooking
1476734941|4.0|I ordered this book because I saw one of the authors talking about it on the Rachel Ray show. I plan to begin using it soon.
B0052CK5PQ|1.0|maybe I'm a prude, but I didn't get past the first few chapters of this book. I couldn't stand all the graphic details of her experiences in puberty
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I ordered Facebook so I can use it on my new Kindle Fire HD when I am not near my laptop.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|this is a very unusual and entertaining book. Every twist and turn comes as a surprise, and it's very well written
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I just purchased a Kindle Fire and having this app available will help me when I need to search for information.
B00AM7E4P8|5.0|I absolutely love this book.  It goes through the main methods of cooking and explains what they are all about, how they evolved etc. The author is a very good writer, and really pulls you into the story
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this YouVersion. It gives me an opportunity to select whatever version of the Bible I want to read. Having it on my Kindle Fire HD makes it easier to carry whenever and wherever I choose.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|this is a good, light read. I will probably read it again, but it's definitely more  entertaining than thought provoking
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|This game really makes you think. I love it. I play it everyday. Can't . Wait for more games like this!
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|this is a really unusual  &#34;factual novel&#34;. I doubt it would be of any interest to someone outside the IT industry, but it's definitely worth reading for those in  the industry
B007IK44CK|4.0|Lots of impossibilities made possible, not  realistic but fun.<br />If you want a couple hours of distraction with a few chuckles this is the movie for you :)<br />Enjoy
B002TQKS14|4.0|Michael Pollan is a really good writer, and I found this book very interesting and useful. I'll definitely be reading it again
B0052AC8C6|2.0|Sorry, I love JD and enjoy animated features but Rango didn't work for me. The movie doesn't seem to fit into either adult or kid range. Some humorous parts, but not enough to keep an adults attention,and not enough action to for children. Dragged.<br />I ended up turning it off.
B0016BWACI|5.0|its a childhood classic i love it so do my kids the video quality is great as well what's not to like
B004SBX112|5.0|this is really a Challenging game.  My Husband and I play it until we get 3 stars...  Challenging and exciting.
B004J4WN0I|3.0|Grateful that this book rises above so much of the clutter posted on Amazon.  This author seems to have a plot, a plan, and a solid grasp of English.  Recommended to me by my sister who thought it had great humor, I didn't find it funny.  But I did find it very enjoyable.  I think the author has given thought to character background and plot development.  I have purchased book two.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Fun Fun Fun if  you like Bingo. Good old fashion fun time playing a game that has been around for almost as long as I have.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Recommended for anyone who enjoyed the old school Bust-a-Move game. It is set back with the cash shop in my opinion though.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|Love t his game. It is like playing Yahtzee. I've been playing for a long time and I'm always looking for someone new to play with.
B008X9Z3UC|4.0|The carry case fits just fine. It is easy to put in my purse with the Kindle. It cushions the Kindle. I like it.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Pines is an amazing novel that will keep you guessing until the very end. Anyone who enjoys a fast paced thriller with constant twists will enjoy this story.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|the book is both tragic and absurd. Some of the details about North Korea are so strange and or humorous that you find yourself thinking that this is just some dystopic fantasy, but then you realize, no it really is that bizarre. A well earned Pulitzer Prize.
1476715904|5.0|This is such a great book.  It is full of fabulous \\"slam\\" poetry as well as a wonderful story.  I will recommend this book to everyone!
B000VK99Z6|3.0|Overall, not awesome, but fun.  I will watch it again, many times, just to see the first scene(s) when they tell him he's being transferred.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love the step back in time into the lives of the aristocracy and the other tiers of society during this era and watching the social changes unfold. The actors performances are superb as well as the costuming.  Can't stop watching!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Pay attention to the vignettes early on - of course, they all connect with surprising revelations. The retrospective ending captures the serendipity of life.  A read that was hard to put down.
B00E0MCYPS|1.0|Who ever thinks this has realistic car physics needs to drive more often. Played one race and uninstalled. The ai was set to medium and doesn't mess up at all. There is an up arrow which I thought was needed for gas since the down arrow is break, but the car accelerates on its own. Turning is a nightmare. Turn a little and the car barely turns. Turn a little more and it spins out like crazy. Not fast and definitely not fun.
B002RI9MWA|5.0|Finished reading just in time for the movie :) I enjoyed discovering the character of Changez through his tone and voice. Monologues are a new favourite.<br />Highly recommended.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I liked it, wanted to read more. Had to pay attention to characters, but for the most part it was a great book.
1400052181|5.0|A very well written novel! Loved every page of it! I've never gained so much knowledge from a book in my life! Not to mention I couldn't put it down!
B0012GMYTG|2.0|Yes that's right even though Desmond Child is only involved in a few of these tunes it's quite easy to see that this album roughly follows what Trash started, that's right we get more endless bon jovi choruses and tasteless hair metal soloing. At least the horrible synth flourishes are kept to minimum.<br /><br />Some of these tunes show promise and I reckon under different hands would've turned out properly, take 'might as well be on mars' the lyrics are pretty decent but the production and instrumentation are all wrong, imagine what Bob Ezrin or the original alice cooper band would've done to a number like this same goes for the tracks that stand a little bit above the rest 'feed my frankenstein' and 'wind up toys' (apart that awful chorus melody).<br /><br />Bottom line is that we could spend a lifetime wondering how these songs would've of sounded if someone else produced/collaborated with Alice but that argument is ultimately pointless, I recommend skipping this one and Trash and going straight to excellent last temptation record and go up from there.<br /><br />Thinking about it now the only pros from Alice's hair period is that it gave him 2nd wind or 3rd wind of creativity that's lasted up until now and hopefully into the future.<br /><br />As i said in the last review please stop calling hair metal heavy metal, hair metal is a trough in music history it's part in history is only that grunge came along and killed it mercifully. Seriously go back and watch those music videos they're all types of wrong and the antithesis of heavy metal.<br /><br />If you love this record ponder the reason why Alice Cooper never plays anything off this record or trash anymore (except poison) and that's because it's at best sub par material. We should all be thankful that this period only lasted two albums.
B001UREJWM|4.0|it's got some of the classic sound of their early 80's work,especially bible black.killer track.tony iommi is a wellspring of riffs as usual.solid heavy rhythm from geezer butler and vinny appice,and this being the final album dio appeared,to me was a great way to go out.
B00ESY77LO|3.0|The movie was made well and the acting was good. I liked the cinematography quite a bit. The constant use of Jay Z, Kanye West, and Beyonce music throughout the film completely ruined the entire thing for me. At almost every chance the movie makers had to draw us into the scene and try to give us an understanding of the mood of the era, instead of giving us authentic music of the day, they gave us modern hip hop and pop songs that destroyed any realism created by the amazing sets and wardrobe.<br /><br />I realize using modern music in period films is not a new idea. I don't like the idea of doing it at all, but have seen it work in some instances. This was not one of those instances.
0374105235|4.0|I read this book a long time back so I don't remember exact details but I found it to be very interesting.<br /><br />It is written very well and gives a cool perspective on the child soldiers in Africa.<br /><br />Definitely recommend it!
B003U53GK8|5.0|Really good. The ending tells us the memory is the most important experience for everyone. Not matter what we need to enjoy every moment.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie deserves 5 stars. Whether a teen or adult, this movie will keep you entertained and on the edge of your seat.
B004YW4L5K|3.0|Writing was amazing, as per most Gaiman novels.  Premise was intriguing.  Buildup was painful and engrossing.  My problem?  The end.  The denouement.  It's like he got to a certain point and realized he'd painted himself into a corner.  There's kind of a resolution, but it wasn't terribly satisfying.<br /><br />I know people usually love this book or hate it.  I honestly liked it, but it didn't really satisfy.  When I think back on it, it's like I'm still waiting for something to happen...
B000UBMSB8|3.0|This is about the 4-disc set.  I've only looked at disc 3 so far, the one with the theatrical releases.  On all three versions, the movie freezes for a moment at the scene where Pris is spraying makeup over her eyes.  It does so on both of my DVD players.  A minor glitch, I suppose, but for me very distracting from the movie.  If you don't think it will bother you, then I guess it's worth the low price of the set.  But if I had known about this, I would have looked for a different version.  The rest of the movie is fine, btw, although I found the menus annoying and hard to navigate.
B0010SKUYM|3.0|I know a great many people are over the moon about this book and series, but I'm not impressed.  The writing's fine.  The story is fine.  My biggest problem with this book is that I feel cheated.  Everything about the first chapter that intrigued me and made me want to keep reading IS NEVER ADDRESSED AGAIN.  I didn't get the book to read about the making of one mage.  Book 2 is not getting there for me either...
B005544TRQ|5.0|I like this series, I like the way the two lead characters play off of one another, I would definitely recommend this show.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game its endless but really fun. You should get it. LOVE YOU MOM I KNOW YOU ARE READING THIS.
B00EYN3HTA|5.0|'Peter, Enchantment and Stardust' is an enchanting book of weird and wonderful poems. You are drawn into a magical and hidden world that whisk you away as if in a dream. After reading 'Peter: A Darkened Fairytale', I was eager to read more of the poetic words from this author.<br />A wonderful descriptive play with words! I'm really looking forward to more books from O'Brien with his creative and bizarre depiction of strange worlds.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Its a great game. Not too hard not to easy.  I like the concept of the different floor levels.  Good job.
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|I enjoyed his previous book more.<br /><br />Not sure it needed to go to Paris  And USA<br />Made us all think of the choices we make in life.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|It is okay for a free game.  I wish it had more unlocked games, it is fun to play. My eight year old and myself love it. An eye spy game.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I got ma friends that r cheap. And so many that r caring with sharing. The ones that can't show love I usually delete. I love growing dragons I love making magic to see what kind of breed come out. The only thing I don't like about this game is that they cheap with the gold. U only can send 3a day and and when u do send gold u only receive 1. That's so mess up. There's a lot of dragons and other things that you only wonna buy with gold but unable too. SUCKY. Its least for send 3 a day. U should be able to get for each gift 3.So for 1 person 3 gift in 1. Person #2 send gift got 3as one. Anyways wack on that part. U only get one gold for each gift. You might receive a day. But the game is cool.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temble run 2 I love the pichures its a lot more fun and pretty the temble run 1 I love the second one!!!
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Amazing love story!!! Sparks does it again! There is a little bit of everything in this book! Especially warm passion!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Very similar to other games of this genre. I can see this remaining on my first gen fire and being played for a long time. So far no bugs or hiccups.
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|Vintage Rebus. Although maybe he is a liitle wiser? Good read with interesting characters.  I have a feeling it is not the last we're going to see John Rebus clashing with that nasty little man from Complaints!
140006922X|5.0|If you have ever wondered why the Bible is so inconsistent in it's stories, this book explains why.<br /><br />If you have ever wondered about the life of Jesus of Nazareth, not Jesus the Christ, this book tells you.<br /><br />A most fascinating book. Extremely detailed and researched. Should be on everyone's reading list.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|ANOTHER TOM CRUIDE MOVIE. AS USUAL, TOM HAS PICKED ANOTHER GOOD VEHICLE TO PORTRAY HIMSELF IN.. IT WAS AN INTERTESTING MOVIE AND PROBABLY A EVEN BETTER BOOK... TOO BAD MORGAN FREEMAN DIDN'T HAVE A BIGGER PART...
B0000844I8|5.0|My wife and I both like this movie in its original form.  The knock off Stargates also have a following, but the original is still the best to us.
B00000IREA|4.0|A OLD MOVIE OF JANE FONDA'S WHEN SHE FIRST BROKE INTO THE BUSINESS.. YOU CAN SEE SHE WAS A GOOD LOOKING GAL BUT HOLLYWOOD, AS USUAL, WAS ONLY INTERESTED IN HER LOOKS AND NOT HER MIND WHICH DEFINITELY INFLUENCED JANE'S FUTURE SELECTIONS OF THE MOVIES SHE DECIDED TO STAR IN... SO THIS FILM IS A RARE... IT ALSO SHOWS HOW HOLLYWOOD MAKES A &#34;B&#34; MOVIE USING &#34;A&#34; MOVIE EQUPIMENT AND PERSONNEL. IT IS A GREAT &#34;B:&#34; MOVIE... AND SHOWS THE SPIRIT OF THE SEX MOVEMENT OF THE SIXTIES.
B008JFUO36|3.0|We like, but not love, this movie.  Good action and story line.  More words are being demanded and I have none.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Finally got the game figured out. Really enjoying it. Not a game for those that want to plow through the game quickly. I am enjoying the challenge of playing the game with no purchase of extra crystals. Not easy but possible. A large variety of different challenges in the game from different ways to find items to 3 side games related to adding to your inventory.<br />Only wish I could have access to the free updates. They just don't seem to be available no matter what I try.
B00E0MCYPS|3.0|I feel like I'm ice skating? I don't know, I've never actually done this kind of racing in real life. The game is very nice visually, but I agree with others that I think it needs a little work.
B0071XO8RA|2.0|Liked it for the most part. Found myself getting bored quite often which made it frustrating to read the book.<br />I also didn't like the way that the book changed viewpoints often between a myriad of people, most of which would be killed quickly after having to follow them as the \\"main\\" character for short periods of time. It made me rather unattached to the people. The only character that i found myself interested in reading was Juliette. I seriously wanted to start skimming through the book to get to the point and it took me days longer to read the entire thing than necessary.<br /><br />The book wasn't awful, but I think its overhyped. This doesn't rank as the worst apocalyptic/post-apocalyptic book I've read, but it is very far away from being near the ranks of the fantastic ones.
B005SHTXN0|5.0|I have seen this movie a few times now. It is one of those that no matter how many times you see it, you enjoy it.
B00498YZH8|4.0|Winter's Bone (Debra Granik, 2010)<br /><br />I watched Winter's Bone almost five months ago as I write the first words of this review. I have been trying to come up with something to say about it that does not somehow include far too many uses of the term \\"wow\\". I really haven't been doing a good job of it, so I just gave up trying. (Amusingly, it has now been another two months between the time I wrote those first three sentences and the time I am writing this fourth; I guess I hadn't stopped trying hard enough.) This is a movie of uncommon power and grace about people and situations who are uncommonly powerless and graceless, and that takes some doing indeed. Much of this, of course, is down to perfect casting; the film lists Kerry Barden and Paul Schnee as the casting directors in the credits, but as with Granik's previous film, Down to the Bone, I suspect she had a firmer hand in the casting than many directors do. In Down to the Bone, Granik chose as her female lead a young character actress who'd done mostly television work up to that point by the name of Vera Farmiga. The rest is history. Now, take that same story, replace the name of the film with Winter's Bone and the name of the actress with Jennifer Lawrence. Vera Farmiga has gone on to be a respected critical darling, and deservedly so; she makes every movie she is in better than it would otherwise be. Jennifer Lawrence has gone on to be a megastar in (as I write this) just three short years; she worked for scale ($3,000 a week) on Winter's Bone, and landed a cool ten million for Mockingjay. She's worth it, and every frame of film containing her in Winter's Bone attests to this.<br /><br />Plot: Ree (Lawrence) is a teenager in the rural Ozarks whose family has long been fractured; her father Jessup, a meth dealer, went missing a while back. Her mother is mentally challenged, which leaves Ree the putative head of the household, teaching her younger siblings survival skills and keeping what's left of the family together. They would have gone on like this indefinitely, most like, had not the county sheriff turned up on the family's doorstep one morning saying Jessup is due in court in a week's time. If he doesn't turn up, the family will lose their house, which Jessup put up as collateral last time he got out on bail. And thus, with the reluctant help of Jessup's slightly less dissolute brother Teardrop (Identity's John Hawkes), Ree embarks on a frustrating, and often dangerous, quest to determine the whereabouts of her father.<br /><br />The plot is good, the movie is perfectly-paced, and the closer that climax gets the more you know where this is going, but as with the best movies of this stripe, Granik teases you with the idea that \\"nope, we're not gonna go there, and in the process we will save your sanity, your hope for the human race, and your kindness towards others.\\" Then she puts the goldfish bowl over your head and shatters it with a mallet, but that's all beside the point. So are the award-caliber performances turned in by any number of other actors in this movie, including Hawkes, Shelley Waggener (Punch-Drunk Love), Ronnie Hall (in his film debut), and Tate Taylor, best known these days as a director (The Help). All of those things are good, but all of them line up as a showcase for the fearsome acting talents of Jennifer Lawrence. Make no mistake: this movie is all about Ree, and Lawrence's performance never lets you forget that. Had it simply been her doing a reading of the character on a bare stage, with someone else feeding all the other characters' lines, I'm not sure it wouldn't have been just as powerful. She's that good here. Her choice of projects since hasn't been constantly good (viz. The House at the End of the Street), but, like Vera Farmiga, Jennifer Lawrence makes everything she appears in better than it would otherwise be. When she has a very good movie behind her, well, the result is something like Winter's Bone. This is one for the ages. ****. ****
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Very challenging! Got stuck a few times but it still keeps going &amp; keeps me thinkin! I recommend it for everyone!
B009GIPDQS|5.0|As always, Grisham delivers a solid thriller -- except this time there's little lawyer stuff going on. Not that there's none, mind, but it's less than usual. Having said that, the book is very solid, well paced, and does a great job at keeping you guessing. There's virtually no violence, if that's what you're looking for; but then again, if you're looking for a Grisham title you wouldn't be looking for that anyway. On the other hand, the book is very much action and dialog oriented -- there's very little in the way of personal considerations and the such. All in all, a very cozy book which will make a great movie some day.

B00DR0PDNE|1.0|There are only three apps on Android that support it.  Two if you have many models of phone (netflix was not upgraded on many of the popular older phones).  Does not cast well from the browser on the laptop, get stuck, pauses, crashes.  Thought it would be a cool little gizmo.  Turned out to be another useless piece of junk.  Does Google take anything out of beta and finish it?

B00AKEMHCA|1.0|Listen. I love this game and would love to give it 5 stars. However, I ran into a glitch where every time I tried to scroll through the stages in freeplay, the game would freeze. This continued for a few months until eventually it stopped. Then it happened again. Eventually I decided to uninstall and then re-install. This fixed the glitch, but get this - when I clicked &quot;restore purchases&quot;, the game restored none of the monkey money or coins I had bought. Now I'm basically starting back from square 1. This is especially annoying when you consider that I've poured over 200 hours and 100 dollars into the game. Ninja Kiwi, if you've reading this, give me around $100 worth of Amazon coins and we'll be even and I'll give this game the 5 star rating it deserves.

B00EY8BRGU|3.0|Nice rainy day flick for the 12 - 16 yr. old crowd. Despite what the trailer & opening scenes imply, this wasn't really a thinking-person's movie; fun to watch, entertaining but not engaging.  I won't give away anything but a fairly alert / intelligent teen could quickly narrow down the list of suspects to find the one pulling the strings behind the elaborate tricks; after all, the viewer is constantly warned about falling for misdirection and distractions. Once you subtract out all the distractions in the movie, the remainder leaves you with few choices as to who could be orchestrating the whole thing.<br /><br />Never the less, the \\"tricks\\" (bank heist, draining the millionaire's bank account) were just a tad too over-the-top to be taken seriously, but some of the standard stage illusions were satisfying to watch. The film starts out well enough but gets less-believable as it moves along.  The number one rule of magic: the simpler the trick, the better. Technically complicated illusions have too many things that can go wrong -- like obtaining the password to a millionaire's bank account.  It apparently never occurred to the writers that your average millionaire actually holds relatively little in liquid assets and what cash he or she keeps on hand is most likely maintained in multiple accounts; accounts utilizing multiple-layers of security including complex passwords with non-alphanumeric characters. Sheesh, anyone who does on-line banking knows that!<br /><br />And that's why I rated this 3-stars. The film was promoted as being somewhat cerebral in nature but, in the end, it really wasn't. Too many plot holes, too many over-used plot devices, zero character development, unresolved plot points. Maybe a good basis for an interesting TV series, though.
B0010SKTRA|5.0|Super interesting book about the origins of humans. Darwin would love it. I would recommend it to any science major or anyone<br />wanting to learn more about evolution.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Like a lot of reviewers, I just don't get the hype. Story was incredibly dull, and the language used for the sex scenes were laughable. This book felt like it was written by a 15-year old girl from Great Britain. It was all I could do to finish this book. And the book ended like the author just gave up and/or had nowhere to go with the story.

B000088E6D|5.0|Michael Buble became a famous singer due to his smooth voice that is reminisent of the great smooth singers of the past like Frank Sinatra, Perry Como, Dean Martin, Nat King Cole and other great singers of the last 50 or so years.  Buble released this wonderful CD in 2003 and he has redone some famous songs such as:<br /><br />1. fever<br />2. moondance<br />3. kissng a fool<br />4. for once in my life<br />5. how can you mend a broken heart<br />6. summer wind<br />7. you'll never find another love like mine<br />8. crazy little thing called love<br />9. put your head on my shoulder<br />10. sway<br />11. the way you look tonight<br />12. come fly with me<br />13. that's all<br /><br />These are songs that became hits by various artists and bands from \\"moondance\\" the famous Van Morrison song to Stevie Wonder's \\"for once in my life\\", Buble sings them smooth with a jazz sound and he carry's it off very nicely.  The Bee Gee's great hit \\"how can you mend a broken heart\\", is sung with great emotion and depth by Buble, and \\"come fly with me\\", Frank Sinatra's great song is sung so well by Buble, that it would make \\"ole blue eyes\\" proud!<br />All the songs on this CD are excellent and Michael Buble's singing and style makes him be right there with the famous crooners of the past!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED CD!

B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Asian has an amazing knowledge of Middle East history and culture.  His is the story of the historical Jesus placed in the actual settings of his time.
B00ENTDDGW|4.0|The game is fun and addicting. Brings me back to playing air hockey at the arcade and friends houses. I think the size of the table should be larger; increasing distance between the paddles. The paddle is not very responsive, but not a deal breaker.<br /><br /> This would be a great game for the kids; HOWEVER, ads popping up full screen for a sex registry search for over 750,000 offenders is not appropriate for young children's eyes.
1616550414|5.0|Exactly as described. This is a book about a video game. What can you expect? Five more words still needed.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|Only because I desperately needed to get to the next book. In comparison to the earlier books this is a snore. This volume was tedious to get through and almost felt as a chore. However, Martin did a fantastic job setting up what I am sure is going to be a great volume II. I did enjoy getting to know the characters in this book a lot more and must confess I've found myself strangely attached to some characters that I would never have thought I would.... Which kinda scars me, considering Martin's habit with well like characters...
B00BMTX5XM|5.0|I love this album.  I especially like smother and touch.  I get goosebumps when I hear those 2 songs.  Daughter's music is different from the mainstream.  I guess that's why I like the album so much.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|First of all I love to hear Vince Gill Sing and all the songs on the Album are just beautiful.  I just play it over and over.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Star Trek Into Darkness.  In my humble opinion, it has a good mix of excitement, drama, humor, and scenes here and there that tie it to past Star Trek movies and the original Star Trek TV series. (Some subtle, and some not so subtle.)  Those of you not really familiar with the original TV series and past Star Trek movies, may not pick up on the lines here and there that give subtle references to Star Trek movies/tv series.  I will definitely watch it again a couple times so I can pick up on small nuances here and there that I probably missed watching it the first time.
B00CSYRHG6|2.0|Within the first few minutes of watching this film, all the warning bells were going off. But I stuck with it, having faith in Studio Ghibli, and realizing that Goro deserved a chance to gain experience -- just as his father needed at one time, believe it or not.<br /><br />All to no avail. By the time 20 minutes had passed I was ready to hit the stop button. Nothing worked for me -- not the characters, the plot, or even the animation. One of the strengths of Hayao's films has been the confidence in his storytelling, where he let the film unfold at its own pace -- including those stunning visuals that captured your imagination without a single word spoken. Here the style remains, but none of the wonder. This film has a distinct feeling of desperation about it, with clever events and set pieces thrown in that get in the way of the characters. When it does slow down, it really slows down, relating mundane details such as eating breakfast or a discussion of where and when a meeting will take place. The bland expressions and mediocre dubbing do nothing to help. One critic used the word \\"Earthbound\\", and though it was meant only as a contrast to Hayao's more spiritual themes, I think the word best represents the film's biggest flaw. It might have been tolerable had it not been for the score. Choosing the right composer can make or break a film, and here Takebe drowns the story with a jazzy, overly cheerful score that is more distracting than anything else.<br /><br />I know many have praised this film. But for those like me who have come to expect a higher level of quality from Studio Ghibli, it might be wise to sample this film before buying it. For me, sadly, it is the first purchase from Ghibli I've regretted.

B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Love the challenge. NIce relaxing game to play while I am sitting in front of the tv. Like the many different patterns offered.
B004H8GLXQ|1.0|By page 175, I decided this author was not worth my time.  The author's ridiculous attempt at writing a gothic novel was beyond awkward.  The characters were annoying and the plot was obvious.  The writing can only be described as verbose, pretentious, and magniloquent(good word eh!): \\"A scratchy veil of fatigue irritated my eyes . . . (s)o black was the sky that only the sound of the rain allowed me to picture the garden.\\" (pages 172 and 173).  Skip to the end for the dramatic reveal - you won't be surprised.

0321637739|5.0|Good gracious this is a big book! What's funny is I KNOW I have read and reviewed a previous edition of this book and I spent a half an hour looking for it this morning, but it must have been before I moved and on my old Blog. That being the case, well it's high time you heard about this monster!<br /><br />This book, Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment, by Stevens and Rago, is the 3rd edition of what is, essentially, the Unix Programming Bible. In fact, so much so that I cannot imagine any serious Unix/Linux/**ux contributor that doesn't own a copy or at least know what it is.<br /><br />This is *not* light reading. It is a reference book. This is the stuff geek dreams are coded in and you are going to want to be familiar with the C language to get a lot of this.<br /><br />All the internal workings and ideas about this kind of operating system, how it works, or is supposed to work and code examples are included here. The least technical chapter in here is the 1st, which is the overview chapter. This goes over things like input/output, files/directories, processes, error handling, and system calls. From there, the chapters narrow in more on specific subjects like Process control, Daemons, Signals, Threading, etc.. Like I said, there is a LOT of very specific information in here. That being said, if you are developing anything more than some scripting, this has what you want to know. This is not to say that those are the only folks that can get anything out of this book, though. Even without understanding the code examples, a person could get a good understanding and overview of how this fantastic type of operating system works, and why. This is the category I find myself in more than any other. Although I have done some C programming, I find myself using this book to help me conceptualize how things are working the background.<br /><br />No self respecting Unix/Linux geek should be without this book in one format or another. Remember this is not a story book you read once, this is going to be something you turn to for the right information when you need it. I almost always give away my review books after I read through them, but this one is sticking around. In fact, I am just going to take it to work with me so I can have it handy where I would normally need the information anywayok you read once, this is going to be something you turn to for the right information when you need it.

The other day, I got a hankering to listen to &#34;Policy of Truth,&#34; and found myself suddenly swept up in a Depeche Mode obsession. Nice to sit down and finally listen to the whole record. It's a deft mixture of new wave and post-punk, and I think several of the tracks could still be club bumpers.

B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I liked every single moment and thing in this book, I would recommend it to everyone, I will just haver to say to readers, they will be unable to stop reading it.
B009PMEEY2|4.0|I had been looking at this game for a while, but was a little scared off by the price. I finally decided to pull the trigger, and I was blown away by how smooth the gameplay was. My only issue is that the game was significantly shorter than I expected. I finished the whole thing in about a day. There is a survival mode, but the overall game has limited replay-ability.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I didn't know anything about the Orphan Trains. This book was a wonderful way to learn about them. It was our book club selection and it is a winner!
B00CKJTVHW|5.0|We've not watched broadcast TV for over one year.  Being able to buy the few shows we miss enable us to really enjoy the season over a week, rather than the frustrating drip feed of broadcast TV.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|Works fine. Some improvement over the \\"standard\\" android Facebook app but some of my favorite Facebook games still don't work.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|Enjoyed playing for a week or so.  Annoying music.  Just the game play gets boring as you have to go over all the old course again and again and again.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|Honestly the end of the movie is what defines the movie. This is Well written and quality acting! Don't miss out
B0062QRTKA|2.0|Played a couple of times, game play is just a bit too boring to get into it.  Graphics are OK.
B009EE1GC4|5.0|We missed this movie when it originally came out and stumbled upon it recently.  The cast is stellar, and the story will leave you in tears - tears of laughter/joy -- and a bit of sadness, too.  Well worth the wait.
B0061P2L5U|4.0|Detailed, well researched and relatively impartial.  This book sets out a solid review of the status of allergy research and focuses on what individuals are doing to solve their allergy problems.  I think this will be seen as an important sign-post in a few years time by anyone affected by allergies.
B009RH973I|5.0|Just like advertised...it is very lightweight and protects my kindle screen so I can take it anywhere. I love it
B004CFBMRY|5.0|Whether you are a runner or not, this is a great story that is well written. Will definitely read it again.
0440246318|5.0|Jack Reacher is larger than life (again) in this fast-paced, riveting novel by Lee Child. The short, concise descriptions and sentences move the story along quickly, and the plot is delightfully interwoven throughout the chapters!

B009GX7IRA|5.0|Such a top notch show, scripts, character development, and balance of humor and action.  And some of my favorite actors from the past.  Loved the Man from UNCLE when I was a kid.
B008KYOCA2|4.0|This is a nice little calendar app that works well on my Kindle. You can set appointments and it will send a noise and set a reminder flag at the top of my Kindle when the appointment arrives.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I loved Jullian Fellows in the comedy, &#34;Monarch of the Glen,&#34; and couldn't believe he wrote &#34;Downton Abbey.&#34; He is talent personified. I can't wait to see season four.  This drama I hope will go on for many seasons.  Start from the beginning and don't miss a moment! It is wonderful!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is so addictive. I play it all the time. I wish there were more opportunities to earn coins. I also would like the costumes to cost less money.
B005XQLBU4|1.0|Ads started showing up a few days after install, plus I hate being badgered to review an app.  Zero stars if I could
B002N44XSG|5.0|Read it it is awesome it has all these little storys and read before lost hero trust me before lost hero
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|This is a well-designed game. The graphics and sounds are cheerful. The puzzles range from easy to really hard, but you don't have to play all the easy ones first to unlock the harder ones. You can choose your level from a menu. That makes it great for me to share with my kids and lets you choose how much of a challenge you want. There are lots of puzzles, too. The Game Circle thing does not bother me because I play offline. No criticisms from me. Highly recommend this game.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Horrible. BDSM chick porn. Thin story lines, under developed characters, poor writing, poor descriptions and lack of any basic intrigue. Bad grocery store Harlequin novel with good marketing at its very best. Couldn't bring myself to read the other two and waste more of my life. Maybe it's just a girl thing.
B00640UICA|4.0|These are good puzzles. Some are easier than others. They are the kind of puzzles that can seem impossible one day but the next day you get on the first try. I like the creatures and their noises.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|It finally had to end.  The first book in the Hunger Game series.  It's a pretty simple story... take one of the oldest and most popular stories (The Most Dangerous Game), and update it.  Change the name of the characters and the story location... and boom!  Although I had higher hopes for this one, the writing to wrap it up still left me plain and wanting.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|Good story fun to watch and well worth the rental. Uses humor over any real gore and a cute love story.
B009QA3VY2|4.0|This book almost seems to be written by two people. Some chapters are very long, verbose and dripped with heavy poetic license. Others are quick and concise, and often merely two people talking. However, the story in itself (although you can see the answer like a Hollywood ending) is quite entertaining. I felt as if he was going in one direction, got distracted, then quickly tried to tie everything to get (editor's cut?). However, if you are seeking an interesting relaxing book, the story is entertaining and has quite a few high spots!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This show is a great show. It's very entertaining, and smart. I really hope they keep this show on the air.
B003O86FMW|3.0|The first book in the Hunger Game series.  It's a pretty simple story... take one of the oldest and most popular stories (The Most Dangerous Game), and update it.  Change the name of the characters and the story location... and boom!  You have an international hit!  At least in this one, she moves the story along and makes a social situation... and then writes the first book again.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I really enjoy the story that goes along with the game and the sound and visual affects are very clear and sharp.  Fun game to pass the time.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|I was recommended this book by a guy on an airplane.  If you don't understand why Wall Street fell... if you don't understand how it was connected to the Housing Market... If you don't understand exactly why all those &#34;people&#34; are truely criminal and should be dragged into the street and publicly shot... then you should read this.<br /><br />From the same guy that wrote The Blind Side!
B001AKTZPA|5.0|it is one of the best CCR´s álbum. Also the CD has bonus tracks and the art of the álbum shows new photos. In Argentina there are a lot of fans of CCR.

B002MQYOFW|3.0|The first book in the Hunger Game series.  It's a pretty simple story... take one of the oldest and most popular stories (The Most Dangerous Game), and update it.  Change the name of the characters and the story location... and boom!  You have an international hit!
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|It is a well written piece of historical fiction.  There are no footnotes to back up much of what is the assumption of the writer.  I did learn a great deal about the days of the Jerusalem theocracy and the Roman occupation and its heavy weight on the Jewish people.  I enjoyed reading the Zealot but I take many of the author's assumptions with a great lot of salt!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I use this at school as a reward for students. games are simple and fun and they love beating each others high scores!
034580709X|4.0|Although this is the first in the Harry Hole series, it's just now coming to America after many of the later books have made fans of many Americans.  Luckily, this is the first book I've read in this series.  I love knowing the background of the hero before getting into the later books.  Harry Hole was a great character to read about in this book.  Alcoholic, rushing into dangerous situations, and unlucky in love, Harry pushes for results regardless of what will happen to him.<br /><br />In trouble with his Norwegian police force, Harry is sent to Australia with instructions to stay out of trouble while \\"looking\\" into the death of an woman celebrity from his homeland.  The Australian police force pairs him up with an Aboriginal policeman, who is full of historical information and strange friends.  The Australians want to find a simple single murderer, but Harry in convinced that they should be seeking a serial killer.  Meanwhile, he quickly finds a love interest that complicates his life.<br /><br />I'm really glad I started the series here.  Really enjoyed the philosophical discussions that developed these characters.  The story development was fast passed, and developed beautifully.  Looking forward to reading all the rest of this series now that I've had an appetizing taste of this very flawed, but very compelling man named Harry Hole---pronounced Harry Holy.
B00AYB1RGG|3.0|Wasn't bad just wasnt as good as the first one i knew it would be cheesy. Seemed like he was trying to be like Stallone to much instead of making the character his own.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|I enjoyed it I kind of figured out some of the plot but the ending still surprised me which is good . If you like magic you'll enjoy the movie
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Loved the other two books so this was no surprise that I really enjoyed reading this book as well. If you like the other two you will like this.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|The writing style, vocabulary, and verbosbosity is so interesting and entertaining. I am especially enjoying having it read to me through Audible.
B005544V6A|5.0|One of the best shows on TV!  Smartly written and superbly acted! The actors are easy on the eyes too!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The ROOM is a Puzzle Player's delight with plenty of Secret Hidden Objects, Compartments, Passages, Chain reactions and Interactive Mechanisms.  The HD 3D Graphics are spectacular and look amazing when interconnected mechanisms open up new mechanical reactions that produce more Puzzling surprises and challenges.  The Music and Mechanical Sounds are excellent and add a pleasant dimension when new areas open up.  The challenges are Top Notch with some very puzzling mysteries that you have to figure out.  Thankfully, they provide helpful HINTS that don't give it away but can get you thinking differently to figure it out.<br /><br />Overall, one of the Best apps I have ever seen.  Delightfully Engaging and makes you work hard to progress.  Extremely Satisfying and rewarding when you figure each puzzle out and see the elaborate Graphical changes that take place.  Similar to Escape the room type games but MUCH BETTER with amazing effects. A very WORTHY app that is well PRICED and I highly Recommend it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it. Great graphics and every level up you get a gem. Never have to pay money. 5/5 great for all ages
0385528787|4.0|Though I didn't like MADDADDAM the final volume in Margaret Atwood's dystopian trilogy as well as its predecessors ORYX AND CAKE and THE YEAR OF THE FLOOD I still found it well written and a fitting end to the series.  Like the previous volumes the book has disturbing and even sleep robbing elements to it though  these haunting images are actually a credit to Atwood's near genius writing skills.  While the writing of MADDADDAM is up to Atwood's usual standards this book just did not compel me to quickly turn the pages like the first two so I can only give it four stars as I did find myself a bit disappointed in the book though that may be partly due to my admitted high expectations.  I strongly recommend this series to fans of the speculative fiction genre but any one trying to read this final volume before the first two is likely to be very frustrated.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|Kick Ass Movie is the greater movie then anything else in fact i'm Gonna tell about the kick ass 2 to me same but better then 1st movie came out .<br />And I love them both once you release the kick Ass 2<br />I will be buying that .<br />!st kick ass is the best.<br />Thank You<br />John Tichenor<br />tichenorjohn59@yahoo.com

B0002TJGQS|5.0|These are name brand batteries, at a substantial savings over local retail.  They work as advertised, and have plenty of shelf life remaining.  They work well in several different devices, and last as long as expected.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|A charming film that may have its faults, but I think a lot of the older audience needs to remember that this film wasn't made for them as much as it was the actual target demographic of the original show.
0345529057|4.0|I wanted to better understand the HBO series and have an idea what to expect. Plus, there is always more information in books. Movies and/or TV series often take liberties with the material.  ok
0091949300|5.0|An excellent history of the USA telling the truth. This should be compulsory reading in all US schools and Universities.
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|Should be required reading for those already married, as a refresher, and those thinking about it. Excellent tool for inspiring discussion with that special person close to you.
B0056AP65I|4.0|These mechanical pencils are great. I did not know they came with the lead already in them so that was a plus.<br /> They also arrived in good shape and in a nice little tin holder with an eraser as shown. So product is good.<br />My only complaint was the shipping was slow. I ordered on Aug. 22 and just got my package today Sept. 6th.

B003VANOFY|3.0|I get the low battery noise after an hour of play and sometime when I have the charger connected. I believe the program that runs all the logitech items you have connected is  the problem not the headset.
B00E5Q1LTY|1.0|I just purchased this movie via Amazon prime for streaming. The movie Streaming quality was so poor that i had to return it. Switching to Apple tv to buy this Movie. The movie itself is pretty good.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Excellent design to blend the diffrent sounds together!  Great to relax to!<br />Keep updating with more relaxing sounds.<br />Really love thunderstorms
B00CO4KGYA|4.0|The game is very good as compared to some of the other games on the App Store. Keeps you engrossed for the entire span of play. Developers can increase the number of levels available to players to make it even better.
B00448SE4S|4.0|I love the look and feel of this movie. It's a movie that is a tribute to the video game culture, and it also have a good lesson about being truthful. I just wish there was more diversity in the case.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|So far I'm enjoying this game. I really love the fact that I can play for free and not worry about paying for certain powers, because I can just wait for more in a few minutes. G5 needs to make more games like this so people can enjoy the games more.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Suits it has it all, humor, intrigue and not a lot of violence. A pleasure to unwind with at the end of the day.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I enjoyed this series immensely.  Love the characters, costumes, sets, story - I am impatiently waiting for the next season!  Highly recommend
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great series well paced, strong dynamic characters, quite a versatile and open story, that can travel in a variety of directions...
B006RXQ8RI|4.0|Did this weird thing where it would fast forward the movie with the sound unsynced. Other than that it was really good.
B00E1L9N8E|3.0|I watched the entire movie and semi enjoyed it.  Nothing spectacular about the movie, it was drawn out a bit and could have had more substance to it.  Don't expect too much.
159463176X|4.0|This is a book crammed with a thousand echoes of the stories in the mountains and valleys of Afghanistan. It is not exactly an easy book to read but compelling, hard to put down and confronting. Khalid Hussein writes well and is a talented story teller.
B00E0MCYPS|2.0|Asus TF101. Played 3 times. Locked up twice, 2nd time it froze I couldn't shut app down, even with Task Killer. Forced shutdown of tablet and then would not boot up. Uninstalled as soon as I finally able to boot (about 45 minutes!). 2 stars because graphics are nice and game has potential. No more than 2 stars due to locking up, difficulty steering, controlling the car. Glad it was FAOTD. I would be pissed if I wasted 99 cents on this.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I felt this book could have been so much better.  It seemed to me that the author lacked the experience and maturity to do justice to this storyline.  The characters should have been fleshed out more with greater emphasis on action and reaction leading up to and following these encounters.  I was left with the impression that she went into a few adult toy stores, asked a few questions, read labels and wrote a book.  Perhaps the next one will be better, but I am inclined not to bother.
B002RI9ZQ8|3.0|Enjoyed the book to a degree although very slow moving up until half way, and then the last quarter just got so &#34;McGyver style&#34; to even be remotely believable.  Was planning to read all three in the trilogy but after this book have decided to give the other two a miss.  The absolute rave reviews which encouraged me to read it in the first place were, in my opinion, way over rated. 3 stars maximum.
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|not the greatest performance for Franco. Or Mila. But whatever. It was visually stunning and nice to eat popcorn to on a lazy sunday evening.
B0091REZMW|4.0|It's pretty fun, just wish you didn't run out of energy so fast or that the levels didn't cost so much energy to play.
B00DM0XXCM|2.0|just not good. Really truly. Great cast, great concept, good cinematography. But lets be honest, it would have been 50% better without sound. Soundtrack, script, sound effects. no, no and more no.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|it is awesome because if you go on onl8ne you have to log on it.it will take forever.if you go on the app facebook you just type in something.it is awesome.
B004GBFF5Y|4.0|not bad for a formulaic script with a good cast. I wouldn't say it was a waste of time. I did shed one or two tears.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I love the diary of wimpy kid series! And this one is my favourite so far. Great book! Get it.
B00CRWJ7VC|4.0|wonderfully cast, great acting, great concept. What kept it from leaping to 5 stars was the looseness of the storyline ties. They could have tied the charcters' lives together a bit better, I think.
0891419063|5.0|I got into With the Old Breed through the HBO series The Pacific which was based on the book along with Helmet for My Pillow.<br /><br />With the Old Breed had a story that didn't just describe Eugene Sledge's experience, but it helped explein the experience of every Marine who served on Peleliu and Okinawa. Written inside a pocket sized copy of the New Testament, Sledge tells his story of how he dropped out of military school while training to become an officer to enlist in the regular Marines to see combat. His story was the most amazing, compelling, brutal, and proficient I've ever read and I have read a great deal of war books.<br /><br />Sledge describes the may things he's experienced in the war such as comradarie he shared with his fellow Marines as the travelled acroos the Pacific. His description of the hot, and sick environment of Peleliu was so well described that I felt like I was there. The amazing adjectives he used to describe the arduous effort in combat displayed by fellow Marines. He went from launching mortars at Japanese gun positions on Peleliu to being a stretch bearer and rifleman carrying wounded men off the battlefield on Okinawa. From the hot steaming sands of Peleliu to the muddy environment of Okinawa, Sledge not only had to fight the Japanese, but the environment that drove the men to insanity. He has watched friends die in horrible ways, he has seen enemy soldiers slaughtered like cattle, and he has seen the innocent natives of Okinawa being killed by both sides. To be more specific, Sledge along with Marine were pinned down by a machine gun nest and had to wait until night to sneak out, or when his friend was chased by a soldier with a sword while trying to defecate and having a Marine shoot the soldier in the waist with his BAR to see if it would cut the soldier in half, or the in depth details he gives about shooting his first soldier with his carbine when taking the Peleliu Airfield.<br /><br />I read this in 9th grade and I'm compelled to read it again now as a senior in high school. I never truly understood war until I read Sledge's memoir. Never once did Sledge sidetracked from the story to overly describe the history of islands or anything like that. He stayed on track with his story which made me want to read it more and more. I appreciated the courage it took for him to write this book. For over thirty years, he was plagued with nightmares until he wrote With the Old Breed. This is an outstanding memoir that I'd recommend to anyone who doesn't want to see some Hollywood recreation on the big screen, but a book that describes what war truly is and was.lled to read it again now as a senior in high school.

B00CDT41RY|5.0|everything about this film was right. Right amount of gratuitous gore, right amount of camp, right amount of satire, right amount of serious issues. It was a movie you couldn't help but take seriously, even through the sometimes over the top characters.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is addictive! I play it everyday and its so easy but so much fun!! I would recommend this app to everyone, no matter how old you are.
B00D3LA71K|5.0|Matthew M. is a terrific but underrated actor. This is a great movie, not too much flashy suspense/thriller scenes, clean cut movie with great story line.
B004HXIZVC|1.0|not what I was wanting.<br />was looking for music, some thing easy and listing to use this is not it<br />.
B000K4WLXA|4.0|To all that enjoy fast paced games and different forms of anime / enjoy / if you are a overkill movie critic, do not bother / you will be lost. / you will need a good quality player or computer to see all this movie the right way.
0060589469|5.0|I have been searching high and low for this book. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in philosophy or motorcycles, or just reading. It is beautifully written, filled with unique observations of our thought process and the complicated system of a motorcycle.. all interwoven within a journey through America's unforgiving landscape. It is worth a second and third read. Very highly recommended.
B00001W9G0|5.0|This is still a tear jerker even though I have seen it numerous times.  For any Robert Redford and Barbra Streisand fans, it is their best.
0857207520|5.0|Not quite as action packed but still the Phillipa Gregory I've come to expect and love. Fun to have a new take on Harry's dad.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Another great book by Colleen Hoover.  I can't wait to see what she writes next.  She has a way of writing that makes me feel like I am living the lives of the characters.  Enjoyed this book.
B0034JKZ8G|5.0|I am a fan of classic Disney animation and not so much of the modern efforts. TPATF is, simply put, a new classic from the old skool of HAND DRAWN animation: this is the best animation since Alice in Wonderland! Dazzling is the best word; breathtakingly beautiful as is Disney's newest Princess, Miss Tiana . As far as the story goes I am not going to bother with the navel-gazing exercise on the racial issues, who cares? This is simply a fun, joyous, warmhearted movie that anyone and everyone can enjoy; I am a 54 year old man, not the typical target audience for the movie, and I just love it. Beautifully rendered on Blu-Ray, great score by Randy Newman, HAND DRAWN (I just cannot say that enough!), great cast of characters,  and if you are not cheering wildly for sweet little Tiana at the end and getting a little misty-eyed at the wedding...well, you must be a communist and go back to the USSR, that's all I gotta say.....
B004T9T2AC|5.0|I was told about this book years ago; however, I was not really ready to take in the subject matter.  Now, I'm truly on track with my financial destiny.
B00267N3DQ|5.0|\\"Snow White\\" was the first movie I ever purchased on DVD. It is more a work of art than a film. Watching SW on Blu-ray is an exercise in sensory overload, it is hard to know where to look for all the exquisite detail running throughout the movie. The scenes with the Queen/Witch brewing up her potion are a feast for the eyes, the dwarfs are fantastically well done (frankly, Miss White is the poorest rendering in the movie), and the scene of the 7 crying over SW's \\"death\\" is heartbreakingly beautiful. I do not know how Disney manages to produce Blu-rays of such astonishing quality, whether they work from carefully preserved prints or use magic Pixie dust in the transfer process but WHATEVER they do they do it better than anyone else: EVERY Disney Blu-Ray I have is impeccable. Snow White has no jarring edits, no quality changes from scene to scene, no jumping from one print to another with obvious sharpness or coloration variations, it really is like watching a first-run movie. Yes, $50 is a bit steep for 1 Blu-ray but if you think about it, what does that amount to over the years? If you watch it twice a year for the next 25 years it works out to $1 per view. I am so happy to have Miss White and all her friends in my Blu-ray collection and you will be too once you see this American Classic on your HDTV.
1600240917|5.0|Outstanding. We lov the tv show, King & Maxwell, but my husband had never read the books that have their history so I bought the cd's & we listened to this one on a recent trip. Even though I'd read the book a few years ago I still was on edge hearing it. Loved it! Next will be Hour Game.
B000HL093A|1.0|What a crummy movie.  Any point it tried to make was diluted and obscured by way way overdone use of surreal graphics & flashbacks.  Predictable, unfunny, and hypocritical, with it's intended shock value spoiled by the expectation.  The movie's it's own critic and defeats it's own purpose.<br /><br />Well, Tommy Lee Jones gave a pretty good performance. But I really didn't like the rest of the movie.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Loved this story.  What a blessing our dogs are to us.  Dog spelled backwards  is GOD.  Their love is unconditional and remain so loyal.
B00D2JDNQ4|5.0|Eleanor Catton's \\"The Luminaries\\" is set in the New Zealand gold rush of the late 1860s. It's a story about greed, power, gold, dreams, opium, secrets, betrayal and identity, but most of all, it's a celebration of the art of story telling, both in terms of Catton's book and the stories her characters have to tell. It's the kind of book that is perfect escapism and which wraps you up in its world. If you like big, chunky books that you can get lost in for hours, then this is one for you.<br /><br />Second novels are notoriously tricky, especially when they follow one that has received the critical acclaim that Catton had for her debut, \\"The Rehearsal\\". Fortunately, no one seems to have told Catton this and \\"The Luminaries\\" is a very different style of book but one that is an even more remarkable and memorable achievement. Also notable is Catton's writing style. This was the standout feature of her debut novel and this is equally stylish but in a very different way. There are hints and nods to some great writers both period and more modern throughout, notably a touch of Charles Dickens, a splash of Wilkie Collins, a smidgeon of Robert Louis Stevenson, a dash of Salman Rushdie and a hint of David Mitchell, yet all combined in a freshness that is uniquely Catton's. It's more homage than a plagiarism of style. The one element that is common to both this and \\"The Rehearsal\\" is what comes over as the author's sheer love of story telling - there's a constant sense of fun in her descriptions and she writes as if she has a smile on her face and is as entranced by the story that is being set down as her readers are.<br /><br />The opening scene accounts for the first 300 pages as the story is introduced from different perspectives, but essentially Walter Moody arrives in the small gold rush town of Hokitika and settles into one of the more basic hotels only to find that he has interrupted a clandestine meeting of twelve very different people who are all in some way linked to the death of a local hermit, the apparent suicide attempt by the local \\"lady of the old profession\\" as the judge will later term her and the disappearance of a young, successful and very rich prospector on one eventful night.<br /><br />The webs of relationships between these twelve men and the victims are complex and at first take a bit of concentration but Catton is alert to this and offers frequent summaries and in particular a rather fuller précis towards the end of this first part to make sure that the reader has picked up on all the salient relationships. The web of intrigue is part of the joy of the book and some you won't fully discover until much later on.<br /><br />The book then jumps forward a month for a couple of parts before moving back to the past. The past chapters are much, much briefer and this change of style is one that you will either love or hate I suspect. It's one of the more modern touches to what otherwise feels like a very traditional narrative voice.<br /><br />Although I absolutely loved the book, this was despite two aspects that might prove more of an obstacle for other readers. Firstly, while Catton's descriptions of people's characters are an absolute joy, she is guilty of telling the reader rather than showing. In many ways this is unavoidable with the size of her cast and this is very much an ensemble piece so to show each character trait would be challenging and slow the plot down.<br /><br />The other aspect that failed to really gel with me is the astrological framework of the book which frames each part. Catton explains that she is more interested in this as a device for exploring character traits rather than any form of belief in determinism, but the device is so subtle that the reader is largely unaware of the relevance. I can see the use of the framework to the writer but I'm less convinced about the need to make this element so explicit, but that's down to my own personal taste.<br /><br />The quality of the Booker long list seems to have become more erratic in recent years, but \\"The Luminaries\\" would not look out of place on the short list of even the vintage years. Definitely recommended. (I still think Harvest will win though).
B004ZBFRTY|5.0|You can tell it was shot on film but it looks great. I love this movie and really enjoyed the time travel aspect. A lot of people hate it, but that's because they're trying to hard to understand it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I had resisted reading this book until a friend who knows my taste in reading recommended it.  I think I read it in 2 sittings!  I thought it was well-written and certainly held my interest.  I've just started #2 and expect to like it as well... and I am not a teenager - I have teenage grandchildren.
B004FP1WX0|4.0|This is a totally bizarre film that is worth an evening scratching your head and maybe feeling better about your life.
0307476073|1.0|I think this book resonates with women more then men. I got it on CD and got through disc four before I just couldn't take it anymore. She I self obsessed. If you like spending hours listing to women talk amongst themselves, then this book is for you. I also happening to be watching the Ken Burns national park documentary which is so chock full of beautiful quotes and insights, none of which are present here. One star is overly harsh, it's ok, but these fawning five star reviews are just Oprah drones.
B004SVM7BW|5.0|I have used  this  app for the past year with no problems.  I open my pdf files in dropbox, send them to this app, annotate them, then send the annotated version back to dropbox. Works flawlessly.
B004W1GCNC|4.0|Delightful program about the past century and the relationships and family dynamics of olde English households.  Some characters I wanted to clobber and others I adore.
0812550706|1.0|This book is very overrated. Not only that, but the author is disgustingly homophobic and actively donates money to anti-LGBTQ* organizations. 0/10, DO NOT BUY.
B00DCRE83S|5.0|Greatly exceeded my expectations.<br />I saw Newsted live, on Gigantor, just before I bought the album. Sobi had had big expectations.<br />Newsted lives up to his reputation.<br />Heavy=Happy!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wow! How did I miss reading this book sooner. A new world to learn and such great characters. It has hooked me into buying the next book in the series.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|I am using this on a Nexus 7 to connect to several OSX and one Win7 computer. I have also used MochaVNC and Splash. But Jump seems to do it quicker and classier than the others. Setup is easy, including an auto sign in for OSX, and the cloud animation is kind of cool.<br /><br />The cursor adaptation makes moving around on the smaller screen of the N7 easy to do without hitting the wrong target. Scrolling is smooth.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this product is exactly what i was looking for i would recommend it to any body what an awesome product
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is so much fun. It is also so real. It looks and sounds like a real horse but without the smell. I enjoy it.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I first saw it on TV, but this disc has so much more on it than what I had seen before. It's great !!
B003TSEL7S|3.0|I thought that the whole plot of the story was ok but it took a long time to get into it... I didn't get why Rick wanted to make the whole relationship between Piper and Jason an IMPORTANT part in the book. I'm not saying it was a bad book but it didn't have that pull like the Percy Jackson Series. Slow start but hopefully it will get more exciting as the series goes along.
B000AMJC2K|3.0|I use this to adjust my computer LCD monitor for better viewing.  The one flaw that is the achilles heel for this product is it will not freely move up and down.  If you need to adjust your monitor after setting it up, this is not the monitor arm to get.  It looks as if the only solution is to pay more for a more expensive model.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Amazing guitar & attitude! No one laid it down and lived it up like the original Van Halen in their prime. Amazing stuff.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I found this movie to be entertaining, but I wanted more.  I guess the ending left me unfulfilled.  I was surprised that in some ways the movie had very good attention to detail, and in others I found myself wondering &#34;how'd they miss that?&#34;  Overall it was worth watching.
B00BIVN82M|4.0|As I expected there are great original songs and covers here like the title song To Be Loved which is an original song by The Platters. Predictably there are songs by Frank Sinatra, who I think is one of his major musical influences, like You Make Me Feel So Young and Young at Heart. All in all, I think this is a great album and I recommend it to all music lovers especially Michael Buble fans.
1470824388|5.0|A Civil Campaign is funny, dramatic, and romantic - though not in any conventional romantic sense - and contains many instances of the turn of phrase that cause me call Ms. Bujold the Shakespeare of the Space Age.  The Dinner Party from the nether regions is some of the most painfully funny slapstick ever committed to prose, and the Honor speech is priceless.  Knowledge of the precursor novel Komarr is helptul but not strictly necessary - I know two people who have read and enjoyed the book without it.
B008J34466|3.0|I bought this album because I love her song Just Give Me a Reason and Try.  Turns out they're the only ones I like and I should have bought just the mp3s and not the whole CD  but I think the price is just right and I got free 2-day shipping with a free trial of Amazon Prime, so it did not set me back by a whole lot of moolah, wait, I used my Amazon Visa points to buy it together with 2 other CDs, so I didn't really spend any money on it except for the sales tax. To sum it all up, I recommend that you just buy the mp3s and not the whole CD if you like only a couple or so of the songs on it.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I was mesmerized by this series from episode 1.  The acting is superb, the settings are beautiful, and the characters grab your attention immediately.  I can hardly wait for season 4 to begin.  If you are not watching Downton Abbey, you should be!!!
B004XGN8W4|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend for a birthday gift. He immediately loved, but even more so when I had to have surgery for four hours. Now he take it on all long trips. Great price- great product-
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a long time. The book was both hilarious and emotional. I will definitely read more John Green books.
B009P5S11G|1.0|I tried to give the album a chance. I can't. It pretty much sucks. If you have low expectations it may be worth buying though...
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Amazing powerful book!  Amazing powerful woman!  Total respect for her courage and perseverance.  I would love to have that power in me to do what she did.
B00DLKXF3A|4.0|If you like A7X, you will love it. If you like Metallica, Iron Maiden, Slayer, etc... you will also love it.<br />Polished, deliberate homage to the early Metal. I see a very heavy Black Album influence; in that style 'Shepherd', 'Heretic', 'This mean war' are brilliant.<br />After their depressing times, these guys came back again stronger then ever...
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|The movie was OK. Honestly if I had not seen the original Stalone I would probably have given it 4 1/2
B002LB13SE|5.0|The previews looked good, but, don't they always? They usually show the best parts. But this movie didn't make you feel like an idiot and hand feed you everything. The women weren't your average sniveling weak pathetic creatures. It was well crafted, disturbing and a few surprises thrown in. The ending ROCKED! Not for the weak of heart. One scene involving a 17 year old girl was VERY disturbing, but I believe that scene had to happen for you to understand the parents actions.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Great show. Lots of action. Brought all the characters together in a great movie.<br />Look forward to the next one.
B0052ZQMLO|4.0|I've been using this dictionary for some months on a Kindle Touch, and was rather dissapointed. A lot of words were coming up 'no definition found', especially combination words, and verbs and nouns in their different tenses.<br /><br />Using it on Kindle for iPad was at first impossible because the dictionary wasn't even recognised. But then after a Kindle update it now works perfectly - definitions come up instantly ( faster than on the Kindle), and nearly every word I search for has a definition. It seems strange the dictionary should work so much better on an iPad than on a Kindle!<br /><br />Now if only iBooks would let you use a German-English dictionary ...
B00APPMB9I|5.0|A fight Club plot and production approach here. The idea of a 'smart-pill' is very cool, and well executed in this movie. Strong actors and story. Very entertaining. I really like this movie.
B002VPE1X4|3.0|fits perfect and is very nice for the camera. no complains about. good recomendation as accesory but got broken from a side very fast
1451696191|5.0|Insight into the mind of a teen is useful to those who work with kids. This was a fresh approach to that.
B003YWUTJI|5.0|Bought as a Christmas gift for my husband. I am not a huge Nora Jones fan, but find this cd quite enjoyable.
B00ENBTI8C|5.0|What's not to love an epic story of old times. With love, lust, war, triumph, revenge and a very climatic ending. I wish it wasn't over
B002VHI8FE|5.0|Loved this book. Great characters, solid story arc and an excellent climax. Good reads comes through again. Can't wait to finish #2.
B000JMKRKC|2.0|While the book was good...it did NOT live up to expectations. It lets on as a ghost story, it is NOT one. The only reason I kept reading was because I truly believed it would get better. It is a good story, but that is all. I have read enough books that there are ZERO surprises in its pages. I left reading being HIGHLY disappointed. The sad part is even the story doesn't get &#34;good&#34; until halfway through the book. The characters are well written, but this book failed to live up to the hype. A complete waste of my time.
B0036TGT3E|4.0|Good movie that let kids find out of risks in life and how to find your way in hard times.
B00BWWS81S|3.0|This album is really a departure from KT's pop/indie style. Tiger Suit was a departure, but not unpleasant to listen to. I usually have a &#34;fav song pics&#34; on every album I buy. This time I have been disappointed on the first play.  Maybe after another one or two plays, I might find something worth putting into the &#34;fav pics&#34;.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|You can pick anywhere so easily and keep right up to date regardles where you are as long as you have a wireless connection
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|As a retired Air Force flyer  I often read poorly researched stories about flying a aircraft.  Not here.  This book is supported by excellent research.  Not only is the part about the aircraft and the flying accurate but you know the part about the personal lives of the principles is also accurate.  This book makes the expression \\"truth is better than fiction\\" come alive.  This is a great book that should be mandatory reading for every professional military officer.  In a world with little honor displayed this book shines brightly!<br /><br />Stan Jones
B006MW3UZW|3.0|I love the series but I had so much buffering I stopped it after 10 minutes & I have digital cable.<br />I am not sure I will try again.
140053271X|5.0|This is an excellent choice for an ereader.  It does exactly what it's suppose to do. I would recommended it to anyone looking for an ereader at an affordable price.
B00B4Z5J92|4.0|cool flick about a cool place.  I recommend to lovers of music; any genre of music. Historic piece of film.
B004J4XGN6|5.0|Great advice for entrepreneurs in the journey to create a startup. This work has helped me to organize the workflow of my own idea,
B008602KQI|4.0|Any fan of The Hunger Games book trilogy may hesitate viewing the movie for the fear it can't possibly live up to the books.  The Hunger Games movie is very good.  It is worth a watch. It comes as close to the book as you can in the allotted time!
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Didn't think I would like it but my son suggested I give it a try. I got hooked 15 mins into the first show!
B00E0SX118|5.0|I cannot WAIT to watch it again. It's such an adorable movie but has a lot of elements that children can enjoy and learn from. It provides lots of opportunities for teaching children about `cavemen.' It has a good story line and the whole family will enjoy it, Watch it! It's sooooo worth it.
B003VDY7XE|5.0|This show is really fun to watch.  It's quirky, well-written, and very entertaining.  I'm quite glad that I picked it up.
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|This movie is narrated the entire time by Spiderman (Toby Maguire) lol So you kinda have to of seen the original which i assume there is... and also its kind of confusing how it's supposed to be the 20's but it's like a nightclub in Gatsby's mansion. The acting was good and I suspect you will enjoy it if it's your type of movie, if not then this is not the movie to start liking this particular genre.
B00CJGP116|5.0|I have every CD  of Marc Anthony  his voice is different then anyone else  and I'm not even Spanish great
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Greatest book I've ever read, John Green did an amazing job. This book was worth the purchase for sure<br />.
B009EHDU7U|4.0|Allan steps through the window of the rest home and starts on a adventure that seems only someone too old to care could have.<br />Or is it? This story surprised more and more as it unfolded, getting richer and more entertaining page by page.<br /><br />The book reminded me of Forest Gump and his life. Maybe Allan is a kind of Swedish Forest Gump, slightly darker, smarter and definitely older.<br /><br />Great book, very well written, all the characters are enchanting, a must read.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Works great. I have a Kindle Fire and an Android, I put the Kindle fire app on my android and now I have another mobile device for my e-books.
1878424319|4.0|great book, have read it twice and ordered the fifth agreement, easy quick read  If you liked the seat of the soul, you will enjoy the agreements!
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|I hate tragedies. I do, however, love the many messages that come across in the story. The story - and the movie - is about drive, tenacity, and determination. It is also about loyalty, and unwavering love.<br /><br />Ad finem fidelis.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very fun game. Addicting & challenging as well. I would definitely recommend this to everyone. Fun to play when I have a little down time.
B00C81AVNU|5.0|What a fun musical! It is based on a British shoe factory that was inherited by a younger son when his dad passed. The business was failing and when a drag queen proposed making high &#34; Kinky Boots&#34; for drag queens as a way to save the business, the son decided to go along with the suggestion and it was a huge gamble that paid off handsomely, saving all those jobs. Ms. Lauper brought back that charm and charm of ballads and &#34; songs to have fun
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Amazing story that forces you to think what if? Well written, great character development, excellent engrossing read. Could not put it down!
B001KT6JPA|3.0|The movie was quite gruesome and violent especially toward the end.  This will be the only movie of any kind that  i download in the future since i do not have WiFi (or telephone land line) and use my cell phone as a modem for internet access.  $10/GB is too expensive to use up for data hungry movies that i can buy cheaper or go see in the theater.  I did go to a local public library where WiFI was available  to finish watching Hannibal since i wanted to see the end.  The acting was great, grapics well done and the story was ok.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|Mumford is my new favorite group.  I enjoy all the songs on the album and have created a Pandora station for them.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I got this game a while ago, and although many reviews say it doesn't load on their Kindle Fire, it runs just fine for me. The game is creative, entertaining, and worth the extra dollar for the extra levels. Where else could you make a giant rainbow dragon? You can play each level over, experimenting with different objects. I rarely write reviews, but I feel this game deserves five stars... hands down.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This is a very good book on communicating in different laguages of love.  It is nice to understand to show love by creating a nice act for my family or friends.  A very good book for couples that are dating.
B00CFA225Y|5.0|Jack The Giant Slayer is awesome movie! It's got action,suspense and best of all it has a love story where the little guy wins .  :  )
B00B596VB2|5.0|it was alot of fun to build, the destiny gundam happens to be one of my top favorite mobile suits! i gave it 5 stars because it came when it was supposed to and it was so much fun
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it so much I can make my own world its amazing. I built a house on a island and its awesome!!!!!!!!!!
B00E3UN44W|5.0|When I say the Series 3 was tremendously ambitious, it was. Yet it did not fail to set the bar really high for the other BBC drama and shows the whole world round. I still can't get over how they faked Sherlock's death.<br /><br />And their reunion! My God. I've been crying for a few hours after watching the first episode. really!<br />In the first episode, you can see how much Sherlock restrains himself from jumping John.<br /><br />Pretty racy scenes for the nest 2 episodes. ugh. utter perfection. The sex scenes were immaculate! great cinematography. everything looks delicate. you can feel how much they love each other while giving in to their pleasures. ugh. utter perfection!!!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I wasn't initially interested in this game, but I wanted something free. It started off easy, too easy, and boring. After the initial training, though, it got challenging &amp; I really like it now.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love despicable me it is fun but it doesn't save very well but other than that I pLay it all the time I am an expert at it
0316201545|5.0|This book brings our favorite characters back together for this heroic new adventure. Chris Colfer really brings the old fairy tales and takes it to a new level. I love this book, its funny and entertaining. I recommend to this book not only to children but for all ages. Even though I read it already I still like to revisit this book and read it again.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|Let me preface this by saying that I have loved Les Miserables since I first saw the musical on Broadway about 20 years ago, as a child.  I have seen it twice more since on Broadway and I own both the original Broadway and London cast albums.  I know the entire score by heart.<br /><br />The good:<br />- The scenery is simply beautiful and gritty and raw.  There are certain things that are captured better on screen than the stage.<br />- Anne Hathaway's performance of \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" was brilliant.<br />- Casting of Marius and Eponine.  \\"On My Own\\" was beautifully sung.<br />- Cosette (both child and adult) and Gavroche were great.<br />- Hugh Jackman sung his heart out (but...as you will see in \\"The Bad,\\" he just wasn't quote good enough - especially \\"What Have I Done\\").<br />- I enjoyed Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen as the Thenardiers.<br />- The new \\"Suddenly\\" song fit in beautifully.<br />- Colm Wilkinson's cameo as the priest<br /><br />The bad:<br />- Hugh Jackman did not have the vocal chops to be Jean Valjean, even though he tried very hard.  I have to admit though that his rendition of \\"Bring Him Home\\" was particularly moving, perhaps his best song in the movie.<br />- Russell Crowe.  Not only is he a mediocre singer, he was a very wooden Javert.<br /><br />Overall, the movie was good, but I was disappointed that they did not have a professional singer do the singing for Hugh Jackman and find a better Javert.
031620157X|5.0|As much as I love Chris Colfer on Glee, he is an AMAZING WRITER. This book brings back many of the old fairy tales and he brings it to life with a story line that just fills you with excitement.
B005JTAP4S|5.0|Peter, A Darkened Fairytale pulls you into the \\"rabbit hole\\" immediately, much like Lewis Carrol's Alice. Only in Peter's case, it isn't a rabbit hole, it's a \\"Large, mahogany clock...as big as Peter's uncle Richard.\\"  Like Alice, Peter's adventures are both wondrous and disturbing.  The ten-year-old boy contends with strange creatures and events that are enough to make an adult fall apart yet Peter continues on and learns about himself in ways unimaginable.<br />The writing in Peter, A Darkened Fairytale, is luminous and vivid, creating scenes such as, \\"In the darkest corners were assemblages of evil, planning and defining destruction of others while engaging in polite conversation and rinks.\\"  Mr. O'Brien is a master storyteller and brilliant in his ability to paint intriguing, and at times, frightening, pictures in your mind.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Amazing. Brought tears to my eyes. Charlie is such a raw character, he sees, he knows, he understands. He's a wallflower :)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This. Is the most exciting collection of books that  I have read in a very long time. I wish I could read faster. Or stay up longer because I can't wait to read about the next chapter. So well written and realistic. Just finished WOOL 1-5 , so now  I'm off to read the next saga .
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|This movie touched my wife and I deeply. For a man to find love in all aspects, as friend, lover, companion and soul mate... It shows what true love should be all about, from within. Our bodies are borrowed, but our souls are ours to keep.<br /><br />Beautiful movie... beautiful meaning... Loved it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is absolutely amazing. Im on it all the time. Its soooo fun and awsome. It allows you to see pictures of ur favorite things and helps u look at the world creatively. Its positively brilliant
B0097HSS4M|1.0|Installed it and when I try to use it,  it always says &#34;Photo editor has stopped, please retry&#34;  I have retried many times, uninstalled it and reinstalled it and  it still does this...uninstalled it last night again and then I thought why bother, I did not reinstall it.
B009ZQJ1G4|5.0|I finally had some time to watch the movie and I was expecting a great movie and I saw an EPIC film. Definitely made to my \\"Favorite Movies\\" list.
B000001GBJ|5.0|Great music the best cd I have listened to in a great while. Also the method of purchase was top shelf in price.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I left the theatre bright eyed like a little kid. Liked it so much, I went back and saw it two more times , something I've never done in my life. Always liked Star Trek since the original series, but loved the fast- paced story, visual effects, and added humour of this one.  My favorite was Benedict Cumberbatch as the villian. Became a fan of his since this movie  and couldn't care less he was different than the previous Khan.  Afterall, this is fiction, a different timeline, and is really a prequel to the other Khan episode and movie.  Pure fun!
B000001ES4|3.0|As noted above there was very little of new songs by this group. However they are still number one for me
B00E0MCYPS|3.0|First of all I'd like to say that this game looks great. Graphics are detailed and realistic.<br /><br />The \\"tilt screen\\" method of steering your car feels almost like using a steering wheel, and I think was a nice game mechanic. The problems with steering are two-fold. First, there is no tutorial to explain how it's done. Only by stumbling around through the options screen was I able to finally figure out how to steer the car. Second, the steering is far too sensitive and far too slow to recover when you return your \\"wheel\\" to straight ahead. For a game that you aren't going to devote your life to mastering, it needs to be a bit more simple for the player to succeed.<br /><br />Next, there is a MAJOR bug in the game. It often decides that you are going the wrong way on the track when you are definitely going in the correct direction on the track.<br /><br />Devs: Tweak the steering and get rid of the bug and I could give your game five stars. As it sits I probably won't even load it again.<br /><br />For free, if you like car racing games I'd definitely give this a try.<br /><br />I played this game on a Kindle 8.9 HD, and encountered only the issues noted above.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love it! This game is amusing on so many levels. The sound effects are great too. I like the new level.
B00E978FGQ|3.0|The whole point of the movie didn't really make any sense. The fact that there were probably special effects added to the movie to make it seem like magic was disappointing.
B009NY43NY|4.0|After reading 13 books about Sookie, I was very pleased with how Harris closed the series...I always thought Sam was best for her.  Glad Sookie figured that out.  All ends Happily Ever After!
B00A2IUDO8|5.0|Absolutely filthy and funny.  A must for anyone that wants to take a shot a friends/relatives from Boston -- Baahstan.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is the best I have ever used and its totally free I will be recommending the app to everyone.I know
B00003CXA2|5.0|This is a film that will never die.  Tom Hanks captures our hearts as Forest Gump, the loveable man of low IQ who convincingly just happens to find himself in some of the most historic moments of the last fifty years of our nation's history.  Robin Wright brilliantly plays his love interest Jenny, a character who, despite all her flaws and mistakes, is someone you'd like to be next to, like in the dorm room (wink wink.)  Sally Field and Gary Sinise both portray Forest's moral compass, doing an excellent job before, during, and after their times in his life overlap.  Mykelti Williamson comes in as Bubba, a friend and fellow soldier who serves as the inspiration that sets Forest up for the rest of his life (so he could mow that lawn for free.)  And let's not forget the \\"special guest stars\\"...the presidents, talk show hosts, and other historical figures who Forest interacts with in his life.  CGI effects, ground-breaking for their time, make this possible so it really looks like Tom Hanks is shaking hands with President John F. Kennedy in 1994.  A timeless classic without any flaws...I'd recommend it to anyone.  Enjoy...I know you will.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|the Adobe Flash will not download it says it does but it does not. What can i do i really need this feature to enjoy my Kindle<br />Fire to it's fullest. please help
B001AEF6BI|5.0|A criminal, a princess, a brain, a jock, and a basket case come together in this timeless classic that seems simple in it's creation but comes out as complex in it's story.  This film shows us all the influence of cliques in high school and how they can strip us of our individuality.  Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, and Ally Sheedy come into Saturday as five very different people and while their characteristics don't change, their outlook does.  By the end of this film, you'll be wishing that they'd all be sitting together at the same lunch table the following Monday, but you know that, thanks to social conventions that dictate their lives, that will never happen.  I wonder what a sequel would have been like (one was considered but never followed through on.)  Sequel or no sequel, it's a must-see for all high-schoolers, past and present, ready to take a hard look at themselves and the ones around them.
B002N44XSG|5.0|This book is a valuable addition to the library of any Percy Jackson fan. It holds explanations, clarifications, even some games and interviews. I like the way Riordan appointed himself the senior scribe of Camp Half-Blood, which adds to the reality of the Percy Jackson world. You will love the interviews that include confessions and funny moments from Annabeth, Grover, Clarisse, and more, although Percy's interview was a little bland and predictable. A short story explains how Festus the Dragon came to existence; another puts stress on Percy's bad blood with Ares's children. A nice book that will clarify many obscure points in Percy's world.<br /><br />VBG<br /><br />P.S. If you like this book, check out 'The Demigod Diaries':<br />[[ASIN:1423163001 The Heroes of Olympus: The Demigod Diaries]]
B00005LOUP|4.0|Great family movie! Jim Carrey is the funniest man since Jerry Lewis! True to the original cartoon. I watch it year round.
1939416019|4.0|Set in the middle ages, the days of swords and spears and crossbows, Thorgrin (read: Thor) is a village boy dreams of joining the King's Legion. Better dreamt than done. Complete with sorcery, monsters, and malicious conspiracies, this is a novel that will be favored by fans of Percy Jackson, Game of Thrones, The Ranger's Apprentice, et cetera. But.....<br /><br />Some stuff just doesn't fit into the story. For example, there is too much mystery surrounding Argon (king's advisor). Thor is proficient with a spear, but he is a shepherd.<br />My biggest complaint is that the book just ended. Blatantly, with no cliffhangers except that one knight goes off to find a bride. I'm going to get the next book, but if I liked the novel any less, I wouldn't have felt inclined to buy the second installment.<br />The rest of my comments are just praise for the story, the fast-paced flow of events, the accurate description of the monsters, both animal and human, and the indispensable inlook at the personalities of the characters.<br /><br />Great book, get it while it's hot.<br /><br />VBG
B000JMLFLW|4.0|Every page with its twists and turns was something to look forward to. It was difficult to put down once all the characters were established. A wonderful read indeed.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|In the game I have the power. The better my army the easier to kill other and steal from their base .that's why kids should play this it teaches how to steal and kill. Because of this game I took 5 bucks from kids in the 1st grade and I'm in 8th. That why this game is awesome.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Really like the different reef items, not so much on how long it takes to grow some of the items and not very many opportunities to earn pearls.
1623650003|5.0|First off, let me say this:  I gave up watching two NY Yankee-Boston Red Sox games (on TV) to finish \\"Alex.\\"  I'm now totally unnerved by this book.  I've run through Steig Larsen and Henning Mankel and Jo Nesbo.  Now, I feel like<br />I should run for my life.  I'm also a great fan of Investigation/Discovery and its line up of murder and mayhem programs.  In fact, Alex parallels one program depicting a young girl kidnapped and kept in a coffin like box,<br />buried under the perpetrator's house. That young girl ultimately survived her ordeal;  Alex, sadly, did not...<br />although I'll bet that many readers wondered about her suicide after her amazing escape and subsequent murderous activities.  It, to me, was a thrill ride with many unexpected twists and turns. Now, I think I might be in love with Camille.  Sorry Wallender et al.
B0088ZSKOC|5.0|I've been using this app every night for about a month. I swear it's better than a sleeping pill.  Usually, I'm asleep before it reaches the end.  There have been a couple of nights when I had to play it twice before I fell asleep, but it was just when I was extremely tense and stressed.  It is definitely worth the $2.99 I paid for it.
0486268659|5.0|We bought a dozen of these for a public reading by the local historical society.  Of course the story is THE Christmas classic, and this excellent edition is well-made and was a wonderful keepsake for all the participants.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|The first level was slow to allow time to get used to the game. Then it gets fun and fast. Will need more strategy as the game gets more complex Almost addicting.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|What a wonderful character Stieg Larsson created in Lisbeth Salander. I've now completed all three books in the series. The story is well-constructed although at times Larsson does go off on long explanations of events already covered... but that is not necessarily bad... and Larsson is so very good at pacing his stories. By the time I got to the final third of the book I found it difficult to put down. Each time I thought I was nearing a convenient spot to end for the night, something happened to make me want to read a few more pages. I enjoyed the book so much that when I was actually somewhat saddened when I reached the epilogue. No more Salander. :-( But here too I was surprised. Unlike most authors who spend the last chapter tying up loose ends, Larsson continues the action with one last adventure right up to the very end.<br /><br />I'm also a fan of Lee Child's Jack Reacher series, and although the physical description of the two characters opposites (Reacher is 6'5&#34; tall, 250 pounds; Salander not quite 5 feet and less than 100 pounds) their thinking and social skills are similar. And then too, both enjoy coffee. Hardly a scene goes by in &#34;Hornet's Nest&#34; without someone turning on the coffee pot. I think Jack Reacher would enjoy spending time with Lisbeth.<br /><br />All in all, an exciting read... good to the very last drop!
B003VANOFY|1.0|***UPDATE***<br />I dropped the rating down to 1 star on these!  I would give it 0 if I could.<br />***UPDATE*** I officially hate these headphones....DO NOT BUY! I wish I would have paid more attention to the reviews on this one but, I couldn't imagine Logitech making that bad of a product but, it's true. Now the headphones have started making a static noise, especially when listening to music. I got the new Lorde album a few days ago and I was excited to listen to it. I wanted to try listening with the headphones because they are supposed to enhance it so much. I didn't get 1/3 of the way into the first song and all of a sudden the static crackle noise started. At that point I had them connected wireless so, I thought maybe the battery charge was getting low. I plugged the headphones in (the way you have to wear them 80% of the time since they have to be plugged in and powered on to charge) and the static actually got worse! I tried unplugging them in, replugging them in, still static. Worst part about all of this is, I can't even return them now since it's after the 30 day period so, now I'm stuck with a crappy pair of headphones because I can't afford to buy another pair. Do NOT waste your time with these headphones.<br /><br />Original Review<br />I thought this was a really cool headset....until I got it.  I hear the buzzing, from time to time, that people are mentioning.  My biggest problem is that you have to keep the headset power on to charge them up.  I have tried every other way to charge them and this is the only way it works.  Also, if you have them plugged in to charge but, you don't want to wear them, there is not a way to get the sound to come back through your regular speakers, unless you go into the control panel on your computer and change things around.  But, I did this one night and somehow it deleted my sound from my computer completely and I had to reload the driver.  All I wanted was a set of headphones that I can wear and Skype with friendsand have the freedom to move around without having another cord that gets tangled up but, since I have to leave these plugged in all the time to charge, it's just a pain.  I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 because pushing the microphone piece up to mute is a nice feature and they are comfortable (unless they're plugged in.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|As a Blues enthusiast, I really enjoy this album - it's one of my favorites. As a guitar player and harpist, I realize the genius of much of the instrument playing on the CD.<br /><br />Very highly recommended!
B009RH9FR6|5.0|I don't have any of the problems others have had with this case.  It is really easy to turn the Kindle but, not easy enough that it doesn't stay in place.  The cover is very soft and has not scratched at all.  The open on and close off works every time and the elastic strap does give that extra security.  You can charge it with the case closed so, you don't have to worry about the screen getting scratched because it's uncovered.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is one of the best programs I have watched in a long time. I look forward to it every nite!!! It's addicting.
B0063IH60K|4.0|All-in-all it is a good app.  I enjoy playing it when I have a few minutes of lag. There are better, but this one is sufficient ...
B002BVOYBW|4.0|I thought Benny and Joon was a sweet, warm, and funny movie. All of the actors owned their character roles.
B00AEUPOVQ|5.0|The acting is superb. The settings and costumes are gorgeous. This is one of, if not, the best Jane Austen movies.
B000V6MQV4|4.0|Excellent album...I'm a closet fan who appreciated the radio hits, but never bought an album until now. The music is solid throughout and I'm glad I finally pulled the trigger to make a purchase.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Once again khaled hosseini has written a novel so beautiful that you fall in love with his characters. It hurts to finish reading it, knowing that you have to leave them behind.
B00BSBVLF8|5.0|What a beautiful movie!  I watched it with my daughter, who is modern dancer, and we both loved it.  Its gorgeous to watch, but the acrobatics are incredible and awe-inspiring.  These dancers are brave, talented and so strong.  I heard that one of the dancers actually passed away during the making of this movie, and I can understand how that could happen.  They are crazy brave!
0399226907|5.0|This is a cute hardback - easy for little hands to hold and enjoy.  Classic story, try getting the stuffed animal to make the story come alive.
1439153663|5.0|This is an excellent story, although very sad.  It is historical fiction at its best.  I recommend it without reservation.
B00EQRMAJW|5.0|Love anything John Legend great album. I can listen without skipping a song . John legend is great at what he does.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I do not typically read &#34;popular fiction&#34; or &#34;summer reads&#34;. But I am so happy I read this book. Read it and share it with your teenaged kids.
B00EB6F1TY|3.0|I liked the movie, but amazon digital download sucks. All the bonus features are all at the end of the movie, no menu where I can watch what bonus features I want, no way to easy skip the ones I am not interested in, like on a regualer dvd/blu-ray! This will be my last time buying a digital downlad liek this.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Was hard to get moving in the book. Beginning was drawn out and at times too detailed. But it did pick up. Was easy to pick up on most clues and see where the author was headed but there were still plenty of surprises.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works good when casting YouTube. Not so good when casting movies online. Hoping future upgrades will improve performance from PC to Chromecast.
B000MNP2K8|3.0|This is an OK movie, but that has to be put in context.  I am an old guy who grew up on Sean Connery as THE James Bond; the early Bond movies are, in my opinion, still the best of the lot.  Craig makes a decent Bond, but like most movies these days, special effects seem to dominate.  Some of the sequences are just wildly implausible, but that's show business.  The scequences in the casino were well done.  Overall, not a bad movie; it is definitely action oriented and is entertaining - but it just isn't Sean Connery.
0440246318|2.0|The title almost seems a misnomer.<br />I have enjoyed the Reacher novels immensely - until this one.<br />The Reacher character has always presented as rough around the edges but disciplined, polite, calm, beyond patient in prior novels, but with a quiet confidence, if not submerged menace.<br />In this one, Reacher comes across as petty, unnecessarily rude, sarcastic, impatient and below his previously demonstrated standards of civility. In prior books, he didn't use acronyms, military jargon that needed explaining to \\"outsiders.\\"<br />I got tired of the multiple references to jokes used to diffuse tension by each governmental branch [FBI vs Military]. EVERY group has their own way of relieving tension & discomfort, be it gallows humor or inappropriate jokes. It's not necessary to keep on about it and I sincerely believe Mr. Child knows this.<br />The story felt disjointed, didn't flow as easily or smoothly from one phase or scene to the next.<br />Lacking also was the usual crisp dialog, suspenseful writing I have come to anticipate & expect from Childs.<br />Almost like an apprentice trying to capture Child's voice and failing painfully.<br /><br />Finally, I do need to mention my extreme disappointment at the laughably inappropriate casting of Tom Cruise as Reacher. I mean, WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT???  Just because he has the money to get the role???  He doesn't have the presence, even if he DID have the physical attributes - which we all know he DOESN'T!!!<br />I refuse to even see the movie until it comes out on network TV, and then only out of curiousity.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is a great device! Yes, it's not as fully featured as an AppleTV or other similar devices, but for $35 and having had very little exposure to developers, this purchase is definitely worth it.<br /><br />A WORD OF CAUTION: if you are planning to use this device on a public network that you do not have any access to adjust settings for, STOP AND MAKE SURE THAT YOUR NETWORK HAS THE CORRECT SETTINGS! i.e.: it is impossible to use a Chromecast on my university wifi because my university network administrators have not woken up from their 10-year technology hibernation and realized that it is 2013 and there are more than just laptops that use wifi.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Game is fun on many levels, but could use a pause button.<br />Gives plenty of time to complete a game. The is an aim and purpose. Game doesn't` go on endlessly.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|I was appalled at how the food industry doesn't care about the quality of our food, just as long as we keep buying it.<br /><br />Farmers want to provide good food to us - if enough of us buy quality food, we can change (maybe) how the food industry prepares our food. Tell everyone you can about it!<br /><br />I was amazed that the journalist wasn't even allowed to look in the chicken coop - and we are eating it!
0553801473|5.0|I love this series! (A Game of Thrones) The size of the books may be intimidating, but the reading is easy and as you get into the story and sub-plots, you can't stop reading.  I read the first 4 in paperback and the 5th in hard cover (which ways a little bit more).<br />Keeping all the characters and their relationships with each other can be taxing, but there are charts of each family in the back of the books to keep you straight.  If you love murder and mayhem, deceit and betrayal, this series is for you.  But you must read them in order or you will be lost.  The series is filled with surprise twists to the plots.  George RR Martin, we are eagerly awaiting book 6!
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Loved this movie from the first time I saw it - very sweet, romantic, passionate, great fun. The book is good too!
0345529057|5.0|I bought this for my sister after watching Season 1 on HBO.  I have since read all of the books in the series and we both loved them and can't wait for book 6.
B0017SWPXY|3.0|It was a cute storyline, went through the lives of his owners, etc. but seemed a little dry to me - not much going on.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I purchased this for my sister who read the entire book series.  She loved it and can't wait for Season 3.
B0083ZBW2Y|3.0|I was maybe expecting something else, but it was a pretty good read. This was written a long time ago, so takes a little to get into the language part of it.
B00E0MCYPS|2.0|I guess you should expect the controls to be bad considering its a racing game on a mobile platform that uses only touch screen but seriously, the brakes barely do anything and the car just floats around.
B008C20TDG|3.0|it would be a challenge to do this in this day and age, but it makes sense for healthy eating. Quality is definitely emphasized, and is worth looking into!
B00127RAJY|5.0|You are n't going to lose weight from this workout unless you change how you eat.  This is a great workout for 20 minutes that works every part of my body.  I always feel like I went to the gym, right from my home.  However, it's not enough on it's own to take the pounds off.  When she says 30 day shred, I think it means getting your heart in shape to work out!
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Fabulous series!  Can't wait for new season to start. Got to see what happens next, a really fine series .goodbye.
B00E0MCYPS|4.0|For a racing fan, this is a good game. Unfortunately, there are a few things I dislike about the game.<br /><br />Graphics 5/5: Graphics are great. I don't remember the old days, but I'd say these graphics are pretty similar to GT3 (but it doesn't have nearly the same content).<br /><br />Controls 5/5: This is a racing game on a smartphone/tablet. Many people will criticize it here because it is a little difficult to start, but for racing enthusiasts, I think they will figure it out soon. I tried the tilt controls for two races, didn't like it, switched to the buttons, and was decently happy. Again, this is not as refined as console controls, but I was happy with it.<br /><br />Sound 3/5: You know when you're accelerating and braking, but the music was pretty bland (low bitrate). This is something that can be improved but no stars removed for this.<br /><br />Gameplay 2/5: This is where I have beef with the game. First off, you MUST complete the challenges to continue the game. You start on challenge 1 and there appears to be 30. Sounded fine to me. However, after beating the first challenge, you replay the EXACT same map with different specifications: beat this car this time. Okay, that's fine, I'll do it once again. Now, I'm on challenge 3 and it's the EXACT SAME MAP AGAIN. I don't want to race the same map (and two laps instead of one), for three challenges in a row. I didn't unlock any of the new cars or any of the new maps. Let me race something else. I stopped here and decided to write a review because I don't want this to continue on for 5 challenges (and because while holding down the right arrow my car veered off to the left and caused me to lose the challenge. I am on the new Nexus 7 though, so I won't blame the developer).<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a good game (and it apparently has support for the Xperia Play which would seem like a good device to play it on), but the progression just isn't up to the snuff. Think about all the other racing games you've played in your life and ask if you could only race 1 track for the first 3-7 races would you have continued? I'll keep at the game a little more when I have some free time and update if things seem to turn for better or worse.
B00CO8D3G4|3.0|I found interesting elements in the book despite the fact the author maintained his ideas were not New Age. Clearly they are! What is wrong with New?
B000FBJAEG|4.0|Can't put this book down. Not as good as some of the other Baldacci books, but certainly very entertaining and fun to read.
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|Great movie. I love Leonardo Dicaprio in this film. It has kind of has a mix of the Romero and Juliet feeling with moulin rouge mixed in. Definitely my kind of movie.
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|good new songs sounds good enjoyable vocals  sounds good together and the music lyric go well together and thats it
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|Very entertaining and non stop fun. Leonardo was great so was Tobey. Great team, great story Great Gatsby. The End
B00271HAK8|5.0|I love this movie and even though I've seen it many times it always makes me laugh. A good way to kill a few hours.
B0049J0DC8|2.0|Feedback from the twins:<br /><br />They didn't like it because:<br />1. The movie had a bad kid in it.<br />2. The dog. It was trying to eat woody and buzz.<br /><br />Feedback from parents:<br /><br />3. Awesome film for the family; everyone was engaged. We give it 4 stars but the kids were a bit more critical, despite the fact that their eyes were glued to the screen. They agreed on 2 stars.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Pam does a wonderful job of explaining the Law of Attraction and how it works in easy to understand illustrations and explanations. Her experiments are simple to do and, while not fool proof, are good illustrations that with a little introspection can be completed successfully.
B00CA3C1N4|5.0|why'll it is a little difficult at first once you get the hang of it it is a really enjoyable game
0896762173|5.0|This book is an absolute must have.  Without question, it is one of the best costume history reference books ever published. If you don't have a copy, get one immediately.  You won't regret it!
B006FE83UE|5.0|Another great movie that can be enjoyed by everyone in the family. It was great to see it again after all these years. If you have never seen it please go ahead and get it.
0374533555|5.0|Dr. Kahneman's book reports his research with a pleasant literary style.  I found it insightful and helpful for my own thinking.  I appreciate his thought provoking approach.  This book is a must read.
B00E0MCYPS|2.0|I see a fun game in here but controls ruin it.  The tilt steering is too sensitive.  The button steering is dumb cause its on opposite sides of the screen and you can only use auto gas and the slider just feels wrong.<br /><br />Give us a dpad on the left with gas and brake buttons on the right.  Also allow us to adjust how sensitive any of the steering modes are.  With proper controls I'd give this 4 stars easy.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this app is great for people who are creative and it has a board for pretty much everything the you might obsess over
B000XUBFE2|4.0|THis is one of the better books I read this summer. I would classify it in-between a light summer read and more serious literature. I enjoyed the use of colors to convey emotion of the moment (usually historical). Considering the historical setting, I don't foresee any better ending. Great read.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Giving d high quality and reliability of a bit like this in a way that you have a bit more about how the UK's leading to be able to be a lot of us<br />Mt.Olive
0061537969|5.0|If I live to be a 90, this will remain one of my most treasured reads. It is dynamic; it is compassionate; it is a story of magical love...and it is written through the eyes and from the heart of a dog.

B002TWWOHE|5.0|I really enjoy watching this show. The chemistry between the actors and the stories are very enjoyable and fun to watch.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Makes the kindle more useful.  Nice screen appearance.  Easy to use and customizable.  Good app to have when traveling overnight.
B00CH26TL8|3.0|This is ok. when I am stuck on my favorite Candy crush and out of lives I go to it. Really just to pass the time. The music gets tiring and the game is very slow. Easier to point on computer than a kindle
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|It's a good game and is quite interesting I think it's a good game and it restores boredom also people are on it
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Downloaded this game and it installed, but when I tried to play it, it would start loading and then just go back to my home screen.  Don't know what happened with this.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|The only thing better, is seeing/hearing Maroon 5 & Adam Levine in concert!  He is so engaging & LOVE, LOVE, LOVE his voice & the band.  Keep it up!
B005TVYVI2|2.0|While it works, it is OK.  I was using it for strokes/minute (spm) beeper, and noticed that it was timing incorrectly, beeping only 54/min when set to 60; pulling the battery fixed that, but it was one of those &#34;I wonder how long it's been doing that?&#34; moments.  Now I check every couple of weeks against a stopwatch.<br /><br />Buttons are a bit finicky, and turning it off with soft fingernails and cold fingers is challenging (push both bottom buttons together - usually results in changing the timing by a few counts because only one button is down for a second or two), but overall it's not hard to remember or figure out on the fly -- it's a beeper with two control buttons, and a third (top) button only used to sync to an external clock source.  Why could they not have used the top button held for 1 full sec for on/off?<br /><br />At four months of 3 hrs/week it appears to have died with visible internal condensation; got erratic one session, did not start at all two days later.  Switched batteries, etc.  I'm drying it out now, but clearly a poorly sealed unit that seems unsatisfactory for it's purpose.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Can't wait for Season 2 to come out!  This is a very interesting series that I got hooked on from the first episode!
B001TCHDPS|5.0|After learning about Sixto on 60 minutes I decided I like his music and wanted to purchase his albums. It's great music from a guy how has a distinct voice and style of music.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|Great music, great performer!  JT can do it all - sing, act, perform & he's not bad to look at either!  Love the band & retro feel.
B001AQIYJC|5.0|This movie will make you wonder if there really are angels. It's very romantic but not cheesy. You will fall in love with Seth and Maggie and when the movie is over you'll look around the room wondering who's there..
B00A13719E|3.0|Not Christina's best.  Disappointed.  None of the music on this CD really captures my interest or shows her talent like previous CDs.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I read this recently and already can't remember the characters or the plot.  I read The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns by this author years ago and still remember those characters and stories...just couldn't get into this book.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|My wife and I watched this a few days ago and thoroughly enjoyed it. I like most any movie with McConaughey in it, but this also has good support from the young actors in it....the location is interesting and beautiful and the movie is suspenseful and entertaining throughout. Will recommend it to friends.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|I am a school teacher so I have no patience for the types of people in this book...selfish, clueless parents, raising a horrible child.  I did not like any of the characters at all, nor could I identify with them.  Spoiler alert.....at the end of the book one of the characters finally does the right thing, but it is too late.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Like the fact that you can play through game without having to &quot;buy&quot; something necessarily. On the Kindle items can be hard to find sometimes taking a couple shots to finish a goal. Still enjoying the game however.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game is an excellent game I would recommend this game to anyone<br />Horse games like this game is an amazing game
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|this book is intriguing. I haven't had much success with the exercise but don't think I have given them the attention they are due. I enjoyed Pam's wit in this book.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have read many of Grishams books, this is one of my favorites! Can't wait for the new one due out next month.
B005LAII44|2.0|Too much woman's lip ruined an otherwise good movie. Hence the two stars.<br />Sorry, no women alive can fight like the likes of Rock and other big boys.<br />Sure women are smart, but C'mon, to fight like men... is an insult to our intelligence.
1400049628|5.0|This is the granddaddy of zombie books it came out in 04 and despite its age its is still one of the best zombie books out there.<br /><br />If you a zombie fan and you've not read this book first punch yourself, then go buy a copy and read it. Its an enjoyable read and like all good zombie fiction in the Romero tradition it offers commentary, it this case in part on the huge numbers and types of survival guides written after 9/11.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|gripping story turns and twists that keep you intrigued and never want the book to end.  Recommend highly! Wish the series could continue.
0316227706|5.0|This is a great collection of Seth Casteel's work.  I've seen his work online, but there's no comparison to seeing the images printed out.  Great book, great price.  You wont be disappointed.

B00CDT41RY|1.0|I don't understand any of his films any more. They are devoid of purpose beneath the heaping piles of excrement and carnage he drowns his audience from one attention-deficit-disordered gore sequence to the next. I truly wonder what would happen to him if he were to ever see the events he depicts on the screen in real life.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Wonderful strong female  characters each with their own secret but bonding together through Tupperware - male characters don't come off quite as well but that's OK.  The female &#34;buddy system&#34; links them all.  Loved the &#34;twist&#34; to the secret.
B00CW7KK9K|2.0|After much research and consideration, I purchased a Pulse.  I've been wearing a BodyBugg for over six years and decided I was sick of paying extra for the website.  My husband wears a Fitbit, so I decided to get a Pulse to see how it compares.  They are very similar, HOWEVER...my Pulse quit working on day 15.  I read and went through all the troubleshooting advice to no avail.  I wrote to the company 3 days ago and have not had a response.  I see from other recent reviews that others are having the same problem.  If I don't hear from them today, I will send it back. VERY disappointed.  I would recommend others to steer clear of this unit until they get the bugs worked out.
B002QYNIHU|4.0|I love Figuarts; I've never had a figure that i didn't like with that said Goku's head is sooo easy to pop off as well as the inter changeable faces. Although the face and head thing bother me its not the end of the world still a very nice figure. As with Any Figuarts its not for kids, parents please don't buy it for young children
0817439390|5.0|I liked this book a lot. It starts simple and slowly weans you of automatic exposure settings. It illustrates rules of thumb by presenting case scenarios.
B00A81MV3U|1.0|I was excited to see this movie when I first saw commercials for it when it was playing in the theaters, unfortunately I never got the chance to go.  I was excited to get it once it came out on DVD and found it horribly boring, confusing, and awkward.  The movie, while the cast is what attracted me to this movie, as I typically love Bradley Cooper and Robert Deniro movies, this one is horrible.  The acting seems too staged, not believable at all.  The movie plot is confusing and boring.  In addition, there are multiple situations that happened during the movie which I found uncomfortable and awkward, mostly random outbursts about sexual activity.  Not worth your time to watch.
B003G4W49C|5.0|A marvelous tale of Destiny and potential. A must read for any sci-fi fan. God speed to the next Ended Wiggins.
B00E0MCYPS|1.0|I was looking forward to playing this game and sooo disappointed! The graphics are beautiful, but steering is terrible! I tried both the tilt and the button modes, and both are out of control. Uninstalling.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is addicting for people of all ages...from me all the way down to my 4 yr old. We cant put it down. It's on the kindle the ipad and all the phones.
0316228583|1.0|I did not like this book. There were too many characters, none of whom you would want to know. The chapters were too short, resulting in a choppy story. I kept wondering what was the point of the entire plot? The characters started out as unlikable people and ended that way, with maybe one or two exceptions. The story is about a horrible town with very flawed residents! Hopefully this small town only exists in Rowling's imagination. Don't waste your money on this book.
B00E978FGQ|4.0|With the all star cast and seeing the preview months ago when it was in theaters, seeing the positive reviews got us to rent it for date night. It did not disappoint! We both enjoyed it and it has enough plot twists, clever writing and good acting to hold us through to the end.
B00007KWHG|5.0|After seeing the show The Jersey Boys I became a fan of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons.  It also is downloaded for free on my Amazon Cloud Player as are all CDs purchased from Amazon.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|wonderful series! very addictive.  cannot wait for season 4.  each and every character is interesting whether he or she is likable or not!
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|These are very nice little microphones for non-professionals, especially for the price.  Sound quality is very passable.  The battery is nice so you don't need phantom power.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Every season is surprisingly stimulating and entertaining, never a dull moment.  All seasons are well worth the watch, don't skip any as their all connected.
B006MHWXMS|5.0|I'm a Palm Pilot user, and have had aan awful time finding a good ToDo app that would do what I need. This one does it. Thanks!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Many, varied rooms 2 play in..and many others 2 play against. a great way 2 pass the time wasted in lines, or after a rough day @ work
B0055S348W|5.0|I love this application. Easy to use and seamless. So easy to install and intuitive... designed so that even dummies can use it!
B0079IEPHA|5.0|Love Harvey and Mike combination!!!<br />Fun watching Mike is growing under Harvey's watch and guidance though he is not a real lawyer.
B004SDSSFY|4.0|I like and use this product very much and download my Excel files from my desktop into my Kindle. But the Kindle is not an ideal platform to manipulate worksheet or word files. It can be done... but its not easy. I use it only to carry and read existing files that have been created on my desktop computer.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Have the entire series-- Love Dexter the suspense, one-liners--just excellent-- would recommend it to everyone- great interaction among the characters
B005MLOKXA|4.0|Each episode is full of unexpected twists and interesting interactions between the characters. Sometimes its a bit hard to follow all the details and can get lost in the plot.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I decided to pick up the book because the movie was coming out and I had read an article about top movies coming out that were based off books. This book and another both sounded like my type of genre so I decided to check it out. Once I started reading and getting further into the book I found myself unable to put it down. It was a fun story with lots of plot and development to keep me enthralled. I recommend it for anyone who enjoys books set in supernatural settings and enjoys deep character development and interesting story development.
B003WJQ74E|3.0|A very promising story line, but the author spent too much time on the unravelling  of the main character, a much tighter  ending would have improved the story telling tremendously!  Charlie went from sympathetic to astounding then  obnoxious and then got to pathetic, then to jeez we know where this is going can we get it ok over with already!!
B00ABLJ5NQ|4.0|Neil Gaiman takes you somewhere else his lyrical words amplify the terror as seen from a child's eyes.I think I will have to read this again to enjoy it more.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Sparks very interesting conversation. Interesting book that reignites debate about female roles and choices. I would recommend this to up and coming males and females getting their MBA.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This story made me sob; I couldn't put it down.  I felt Will's pain.  Will's character reminded me of Christian Gray  (of Fifty Shades of Grey) on top of the world, but what he would have become if suddenly suffering a great physical tragedy.  I'm buying three more copies to give to my friends and daughter for a birthday present along with a box of tissues!
B009VSW15Y|5.0|Easy to use.  Pictures are large and clear.  Fun to take pictures and e-mail them to family that I don't  see  often,  keeps them in the loop  for being able to stay included in the family.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is a virtual world game that i love i already have version 7.5 i love this game because m3 amd my friends created a club and has joined many worlds where we could play together
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I enjoyed reading the husband's secret and was surprised by the twist.  I just felt the ending was abrupt.  I wanted to know more of how their lives continued.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I was surprised by this move. I love sy-fy without a lot of horror mixed in. The movie plot was good and the acting was great also. Actually I like Tom Cruise but of late he has let me down and Morgan Freeman in this one wow! If you like science fiction on the line with Terminator I think this is it.
B009NQZVKG|4.0|There's not much more I can say about the books in Sigma series. I adore the series and love how Mr. Rollins takes different facts and transforms them into unbelievably real scenarios. with lots of good, fun (sometimes James Bondy type) action included.
B00005JLR2|4.0|I liked this animation and story line because as a youngster I read every comic book I could get. This movie has a grab you story line and the action is continuous and good. I like it for the young and old who are young at heart and like good animation/action without the gore of the modern era movies.
0618918248|2.0|I found 'The God Delusion' to be unconvincing.  Dawkins makes valid points about the shortcomings of religions, in particular the sky-god ones, to which I mostly agree.  But the problem is, and one I am disturbed by, is that 'science' has a strong tendency to become quite dogmatic just like many religions of the world.  We are not machines.  We are not lumbering robots mindlessly controlled by genetics.  There is something intertwined with life and the universe.  I still like George Lucas' idea of the 'The Force,', but on a more subtle level. What, 95% of the universe is made up of unknown 'stuff'?  Yet we then claim to know how things work; everything is just a sum of its parts (materialism) and they have certain chemical and physical properties?  Simple, right?  Well, then how come we haven't even come close to creating am amoeba, let alone a multi-cellular organism like a mammal?  Not that we can't eventually, but I guarantee it will require 'science' to take off it's materialism filters and allow insight into the unknown.  Atom smashing is revealing fascinating new insights, but will it reveal the ultimate truth of reality?  Or will we just keep finding smaller and smaller things within things, all the way down to the hypothesized String theory?  But even then, what is behind the 'behavior' (vibrations) of the strings?  A force of some sort perhaps?  One that doesn't &lt;gasp> have any material?  Why is such a notion seen as ridiculous?  Like we really know one way or the other?<br /><br />We need open minded people in the world.  Much of the universe is a COMPLETE mystery and the best way to explore it is without preconceived ideas that filter out potential clues.  I suppose that makes me an agnostic, as William Rowe describes it \\"the view that humanity does not currently possess the requisite knowledge and/or reason to provide sufficient rational grounds to justify the belief that deities either do or do not exist\\", except instead of deities I like the force idea.  My mindset allows me to be open to possibilities.  I find atheism to be close-minded and very rigid, clinging to the knowledge of its time frame, which of course changes over time anyway. So, why be so rigid?  Is the need for certainty (even if it's an illusion) so compelling?<br /><br />And speaking of dogma, Western medicine in particular is absolutely in the dark, and it relates exactly to rigid materialistic thinking.  The human body has been fragmented (specialization) and treated like a material object for a couple of centuries now and the results are becoming quite clear this path has failed.  Chronic diseases are exploding in occurrence.  And it coincides exactly with the use of fragmented medicine, which includes drugs, vaccines, and surgeries, none of which view the body as an exceptionally complex and highly interwoven organism, and with the near pathological discounting of nutrition and trying to understand the underlying issues behind disease.  But that is changing and fast. Notice the idea of 'whole' foods coming back?  Things like stress are being taken seriously now?  Our mindset absolutely affects our health (the placebo effect)?  Medical 'science' scoffed at such notions in the past, but not anymore.  However, most MDs are still practicing 19th century medicine.  Avoid them.  Find practitioners who are open to the 'crazy' notion that food is the best medicine and that accept the mind-body connection.  A bit off topic here, but health issues are so common and it relates to a mindset much like Dawkins.<br /><br />For a much more insightful read, check out 'The Science Delusion' by Rupert Sheldrake.  He points out the tendency of science to become dogmatic throughout history and essentially dismantles the idea that we have everything figured out (which we don't, not even close).  It isn't an 'intelligent design' attempt, but a hard reasoned look AT science..  My mindset allows me to be open to possibilities.

B000ICKPOQ|5.0|I am a science fiction lover from the 70's and like my story line without the overwhelming horror like the tv and movies today. The Stargate soga in it's many offerings have a good storyline to me so are worth watching. Amazon prime membership helps a lot since I can watch continuously at my leisure without commercials which is also great. Sometimes the episode may not be great but the totality of the story is worth the time to view it.
B00BBQXUYK|5.0|One of my family and kids favorite movie! It has all our favorite guardians we all grow up believing in! This movie is a bit sad with the story of JAck Frost, but definitely sends a great message to kids.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|I am a disappointed G.I.Joe fan. I was so looking forward to seeing this sequel as the first movie seem too short and left me wondering if the movie makers had really read the comic books. Since they left me hanging with the first movie surely the next up movie was going to be a huge lift up for us fans. The didn't even have general hawk, rip cord (Waymans needed to be replaced), duke for only a cameo, no scarlet and they killed off the G.I.Joe franchise. The tech was even retro and a let down from the first movie. Sorry will not be adding this movie to my DVD collection. Hopefully the next installment will be better. The movie makers need to read the comic books to get a better understanding.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Classic CW -- remade with love.<br /><br />I purchased based on an NPR interview and studio perfomance. Played it several times over straight through as soon as it came.<br /><br />Great pedal steel playing, great guitar playing, and wonderful singing.  I'd love these guys to do another record along these lines...<br /><br />If you like classic CW from the 50's and 60's this record is a must have record.
B0063M22QO|3.0|The Kindle Tablet Edition of Mahjong is a okay app. I was looking for a mahjong game app to take with me on the go. The price was right and since the mahjong app was made for the Kindle thought I'd try it. It is responsive and the play is okay but I really did like the graphics of the free app I had the first 2 years on my Kindle Fire. Something happened to the app the colors corrupted so I needed another app. Thought this one would be better since I had to pay for it, but not great does the function gives me something to do at the doctor's office, or waiting in the mall.
B003SHUMRI|5.0|if you love to watch people dance...this is a good movie for it. I had begun to watch it on tv years ago and gave up on it..my loss.  I watched it several times just to see the choreography and the talent of the dancers!
8866135879|5.0|This item is a great size to carry in a purse.  The pocket is helpful to hold receipts.  I haven't used the stickers but they may interest some. Very good price.
1591396190|4.0|The material is well explained however it should be updated.  It has been since 2005 and today's business world evolves very quickly.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|I bought this to go with my other present to my older brother's 68 th upcoming birthday, a &#34;Robbie the Robot model..
B005HED11Y|4.0|Star Trek, the original series has always been one of my most favorite sci-fi tv shows. I've watched them all many times!
B00EQNYOYU|5.0|Really awesome mix of old sounding NIN and new sounds. Does not disappoint at all. The remixes are just ok.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Fun game to play...great way to spend some time. Look forward to doing a lot more and expanding! So many fun things to do.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This kindle version is sooo much fun! I can't put it down, day or night, this is the best game ever
B00E0MCYPS|1.0|if you like donuts then this is your game.<br />slight corrections don't so anything but a larger turn makes donuts and spin outs<br />don't get this game.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|This is the best movie ever, I watch it whenever I can, I think it's a lot better than the second one, love it!
B0018LMZO4|5.0|My husband and I have loved their music for many years and I'm so glad we were able to get this.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|I'm only giving it 3 stars because of the ending, NOT what I expected. The beginning and middle of the book were great, the ending was too &#34;fast&#34;.
B00CWVGBEO|5.0|This movie gets an A+ in my opinion. It offers a solid story, interesting characters, humor, and a flare that reminds me of the old 80's flicks. Its the age old story of unlikely average people rising up to do great things.
B00821OX98|4.0|Great series.  This is an interesting plot. It keeps you wanting more.  If you like sci fi you will like
B00AECGQF2|3.0|This is a super cute game. Very fun and good for practicing fine motor skills. The sounds though...the moans during the styling process sound like someone is watching porn. And there is no option to turn off sounds. Change the sounds and give an off option and i will change my review to five stars.
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|I don't mind spending $4.99 on a game when it's great like this one. The graphics are great, with lots of hidden object games and many mini puzzle/ mind games. I wish you would make more like this one.
B0076DELIG|3.0|This one live up to expectations. A seemingly unsolvable murder falls into  the hands of Harry 20 years after he  had first been involved wit it. Connelly leads us through twists and turns to the  exciting climax as Harry succeeds again.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I love the game but it just reset itself and I lost everything including the character I paid for usain bolt and the coin multiplier that I also paid for. feel quite ripped off. beware and just play for fun ... don't spend any money!!!!
B008LODRT8|3.0|Book 3, in my opinion, was a good ending and much easier to read than Book2!!  Enjoyed the set very mucg.
B00CW7KK9K|3.0|It does everything as advertised.  Sync's easy to iPhone.  But sleep arm band is very cheap.  The strap fell off the 3 time I wore it.  No response as of yet from withings on a replacement.
B004X80QNG|4.0|The app auto syncs with Google calendar. Eau to use. Very customizable through the settings. Glad I was able to get this as a free app.<br /><br />As a side note: I noticed complaints about the interface not looking like the screenshots. Go to the Settings menu. There is an option to change the UI to the tablet UI rather than the mobile UI. Check this box and, voil&agrave;, you have tabs just like the screenshots.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I really enjoyed this book! I was completely engrossed in the characters and their intense emotions. I couldn't put it down and finished it within two days. A wonderful, but heartbreaking love story! Read it, you won't be disappointed - but keep a box of tissues handy.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Watching Downton Abbey becomes an addiction.  I was not sure about all of the fuss and then I started watching.<br />Very enjoyable.
B00CFYAT6O|2.0|Sorry, I am a huge Allman Brothers band fan and a fan of Derek's band as well. However, this album contains a bunch of boring songs that are hard to distinguish from one another.I really tried to like this album, listened to it several times, it never clicked.  More power to those that like it. I know I am a minority in here, but I just don't like what Trucks produces under this arrangement.
0553801473|5.0|Words do not do this series justice. Must read for anyone over age 18, regardless of genre propensity. Truly Tolkiens successor and more.
B00E0MCYPS|4.0|I really like the graphics. Its a little hard to drive but thats more of a user issue than app. My Son really likes this game over other racing games.
B00AC8ZIXO|5.0|After all the havoc trying to release an adaptation to the big screen, this one does a pretty good job at it.<br />It could have done without the bloopers at the end though.
B001DJ7PR8|5.0|Very excellent film! My wife hates it, but I think it is well-written and comical. Soundtrack is excellent.<br /><br />Delivery was VERY prompt! Disc plays perfectly.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|This is a great Romance period movie if you're into that.  I personally loved this movie.  If you like Pride & Prejudice, Emma or anything like that, this movie is for you!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so fun because when I am on the go I just open it up and I can play minecraft
1449417051|5.0|I bought this calendar with hopes to frame the pictures (they are hilarious)! This one was 2013, so it's probably old now :)
B000LVAQDE|4.0|A wrongly written piece about a warrior's rewritten home from Vietnam. There are so many aspects to consider: emotional, physical, mental (what we know now as PTSD).<br /><br />The visuals, the writing, the acting. An action film with everything.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I love this game and so does my kids. It's very challenging and fun. My kids spend hours playing it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Hi i have an extra high score so yah. It freezes sometimes but better than temple<br />run cuz no tilting of the screen
B00003CXI1|5.0|&#34;The Sorceror's Stone&#34; is the first of the eight Harry Potter movies, based on the seven books by J.K. Rowling.  The whole series is one grand epic.  Each installment is on the level of the age of the primary characters.  So, while the first is a grand adventure, by the end of the last, it's a full-scale war.  Due note should be taken.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! Any creative soul can benefit from reading this. Easy to understand what he was portraying and shared motivating concepts!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This is 6th time on 6th device to have downloaded this app. This app has helped my family and dog individual to relax and sleep.  This is a sfreat app for babies. Try the free version and do not choose too many sounds at once.  That is too much.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This app is perfect for adult and child entertainment. It's simple, has fun colors, and let's you get creative. You can play for chunks of time or just one moment. Convenient for on the go traveling.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Great game love making new dragons and decorating my park I can't wait for all the new updates in the future.
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|This game was very fun for a little while, but you really have to buy everything.  I loved the game and played it everyday but after a while it gets very boring and honestly I don't think I'll play it very much anymore. It's a great children's game 2-8 or 9 but I don't play it. I guess how long you play depends on your age. The only other thing wrong with it is that you comb the hair by strands.... I highly recommend Toca Boca Hair Salon 2, where you can wash the hair , comb it, grow it, cut it, shave it,  and add tons of fun accessories. Toca Boca is $3 but definitely worth it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is the best for horse lovers so I recommend this game to all u horse lovers out there
B008XKSW7M|4.0|It's a pretty good movie..have always enjoyed Cameron Diaz and Jennifer Lopez...how can you go wrong when you put these two together.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I am so addicted to this game. I love love love it. I can sit down and play it hours upon hours.
B00124LYHQ|5.0|well, he is sexy. But I don't think he should be on the cover pic.<br />The story is more about Blanche. Fantastic story.<br />Really sad and a classic by Tennessee Williams.<br />Must see, then try to read the play or try to see a live performance.<br />AWESOME!
B0091REZMW|5.0|Mystery manor is a fun game I have had no problems with. And you can connect to Facebook on it so I have fun with my friends on it. It has interesting sometimes hard to find items. And all the people whining about you have to buy once you get to play it are wrong. I have never had to buy anything on it so it's completely free. And  You can go to different floors and rooms and play as much as you want until your energy runs out but it charges fast.
B005EHQGTS|5.0|This app provides worldwide access to everything on your pc via your phone. Video, spreadsheets, databases, presentations...all can now be driven from the phone.

B003M70O5O|5.0|I was hooked from the first episode and I could not wait to get the other seasons. After each episode I had to keep watching...staying up till late at night just to get in &#34;just one more&#34; episode
1594136467|5.0|I loved this book , it reaffirms what I have already thought as a child growing up ,I was spiritual not religious.

1594204217|5.0|First off, I'm a total Michael Pollan fan. I first read \\"Food Rules\\" many years ago, which made so much sense that it became the springboard for my becoming vegan, a lifestyle that has lasted and lasted. Each and every one of his books has rekindled my commitment to stay away from processed foods and the other over-manufactured foods on the grocery shelves.<br /><br />\\"Cooked\\" takes the next step. Pollan uses the four elements (earth, air, fire, and water) to show us the delights of home cooking and the benefits therein. While I don't eat meat, I still enjoyed his adventures thru barbeque and braising (without any desire to try the foods he cooked), but it was his adventures into bread baking and fermentation that really spurred my imagination.<br /><br />Pollan, a polished and award winning writer, takes the under-recognized elements of food and nutrition and makes them mystical. For example, the intricate interplay of microbes used in bread baking become characters in the drama of the baked loaf. He has an understanding of the interrelationship between food and society that made me sit back and sigh. Yes, it's all so clear now.<br /><br />This is a very special book ... a perfect companion to Michael Moss' \\"Salt Sugar Fat.\\" We can turn the current health crisis around if we listen to these sages of food.<br /><br />I could write more, but I need to go punch down the bread dough that is rising in the kitchen....
B0000793ZC|5.0|I owned this album in the 80's on cassette, later on CD and now digitally.  It caught this great group at their prime.  I think many of the songs sound better on this live album than they did originally.  25 years later, this album is still a regular monthly play for me.  It never gets old.
B008469DGY|5.0|Good solid game. Worth the price. Enjoy. Enjoy. Enjoy. Enjoy. Enjoy. Enjoy. They make you wrote twenty woods for these reviews. All I wanted to do was give is some stars. If they just let people give stars they would get more reviews.
B0053ZOQMK|5.0|This movie is one of the best cartoon movies of all time, I specially liked the chase scene when the mole people chased the towns people... awsome
B009XIXVU6|5.0|After having just read The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns, I didn't think Khaled Hosseini would WOW me again;  I was wrong!  Wonderful stories and a look into Afghanistan's long history of invasion, occupation, inhumane treatment and corruption.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I loved the first season & this one is even better in my opinion. What's there not to love about a creepy, demented horror series, based in a 60s insane asylum?!?!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|When I ordered the item, it was listed with a 3 months of free Netflix service as promotion. Although later Amazon changed the promotion deadline to 7/24/13 5:30pm PST, I remained eligible as ordered before that - at 5:15pm PST, 7/24/13. However, I never got the promotion code, which I was supposed to get within a week of the order.
B0062OCNAI|5.0|This is one of the most unusual books I have read in a long time.  The way that the plot is presented  is truly captivating and will keep you reading until its resolution.  The author  makes the characters so real  and you feel as if you are  in the book, literally! fantastic !
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this app is great for people of all ages. it is just like another game I play on my kindle
B00637D114|4.0|This wasn't to bad however every once in a while one of those innuendos shows up and hopefully the kids don't pick up on it. But for the most part good show. I'd let my grand children watch the show.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Like everything about this CD . Purchased specifically for the Wagon Wheel Tune , but found this CD was loaded with great tunes .<br />Have seen Darius in concert several times , but Wagon Wheel is a classic . One will be pleased that there are several great tunes on this CD and not just one or two as you find on many CD's . Darius Charleston SC. is the closest to compare with this CD .
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|This game is just so much fun and addictive. I had to take it off of my kindle just<br />for a little while. So I could read a book or find other games.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Definitely enjoyed this one, kept me interested until the very end.  This one had a little more depth than What Alice Forgot, although I enjoyed that as well.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This is a great game, I love playing it so much. I can literally play for hours its so fun. I just wish I had more tokens!
B00ECU2RGY|2.0|Meh. It was barely OK enough to justify watching to the end. Don't waste money. Wait until it drops to Ntflx or something else.
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|Good but freaky with the lookalikes at the end, that part I did not like, lost imagination, lost me . disappointed with ending.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game.  Need more levels.  Not bad for free app.  Challenging but not impossible.  Do not need to cheat to solve any level.
B00DGN51O8|4.0|Great animation these days, didn't have much story strength or plot are something, but interesting to look at. Could have been much better.
B009X2CUYA|5.0|I loved the characters and the use of the old story in the current story line. A tour de force
B00EE3FVSU|4.0|Well acted and well paced.  I look forward to the next season as they leave a few clues to worth pursuing.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is awesome!!! It is so worth 6.99! I love the survival mode in it you can collect stuff like meat from animals and at night there are zombies that you kill and spiders with red glowing eyes! Awesome game you should get it!
B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|...to consider myself a Dylan fan and not have heard a single tune off the original Self Portrait?  I held it in my hands many times, looked it over and never pulled the trigger.  I am not even sure why.  Now this-Another Self Portrait is a revelation.  Wonderful song selection of other's music, played and sung with a deep sense of personal emotion.  Sure there is quite a bit of Bob's \\"Lay Lady Lay\\" voice, which some do not like; I really enjoy it.  This is one of many transitions for Dylan as his voice matures in advance of his mid-70's re-emergence.  I have blindly purchased all of the Bootleg Series collections.  I was not expecting to enjoy this set so much.  In fact, much of this collection is truly thrilling.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Each chapter was a slow build to the ending, which by the time I reached it, I was breathless and needed a tissue to wipe away the tears!
B009YP9L7U|3.0|It was ok I guess I read the whole thing. It had too many turns and I got lost in it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the minions game ., my kids are very happy with this game ., and even my self I'm always playing at work when ever I'm bored
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Great story line. Great action. And an action packed fight scene that seemed to last half of the movie. Great job to all.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Great book, kept me interested.  Very well written. Should watch the show on Netflix after reading!  Worth every penny. Super!
159420229X|5.0|I teach Memory Training (yes, that is my job!) and I loved this book.  Validates everything I do and gives me lots of great, practical stories to share with students.  A perfect book to compliment any formal memory training programs you may have taken.
B003F44QRQ|5.0|Love this movie its a classic grew up on corey haim and corey feldman its a must see movie vampires are hot
B006BXTOFC|4.0|A great album to have in your collection.  Can be used for easy listening or for rocking out.  SO far so good!
0131103628|5.0|If you've worked with C, you know it is terse, compact, and sometimes unforgiving.  This book was the de facto standard for C prior to ANSI, and after that remained pretty definitive.  This book is small, so one might mistakenly assume it is less thorough, but C is not a big language, and it doesn't need a big book.  The important thing is to understand the features that it DOES offer, because failure to get the nuances of those can be catastrophic.  I am a software engineer by trade, and use C (usually ANSI but sometimes K&R for older things) and it's still helpful to refer back to function references or the language specification.  If you need a data structures book or algorithms or some kind of guidance how to go about writing programs, there are plenty of others on those topics; this book does not (and should not) cover those.  If you need to know C and know it well, I highly recommend this.<br /><br />Having programmed SOMETHING is really all that one needs to understand the basics.  Having seen the UNIX/Linux system calls is helpful, but that chapter is self-contained and one can learn the rest without an issue.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Please make it like the Pc version you guys are awesome make portal's<br /><br />The if you read or did this
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Yet another Wonderful book in this series by this author.  George Martin is a master at creating intriguing characters. I couldn't put it down!
B007SSF3O0|3.0|Gwyneth does a good performance and is worth watching.  The movie does not take much concentration and scenery is nice.
B001O3UJ8K|5.0|I have always liked this album. Great music to listen to. Not a bad price on the CD at amazon.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I loved figuring out where each bird should be used for maximum effectiveness.  There was rush of excitement when the structures would tumble down.
B00150W1K6|5.0|I have always liked this album. Great music to listen to. Not a bad price on the CD at amazon.
B00E0MCYPS|3.0|This game takes some time to get used to if you're used to racing asphalt tracks. I tried the 'lite' version on my Nexus 7 and it didn't work right. This one does though. It's not in the league of GT Racing or Real Racing, but hey, (they) hound you all the time for money, this one doesn't! The only thing I really dislike is the amount of sliding the cars do on the paved portion of the course. In the dirt I expect it, but not on the asphalt. For the faotd,or even the buck they normally charge, it's an OK game that doesn't hound you to spend, spend, spend your money.. Maybe this developer could build a racing game like RR3 or GT Racing2 and just charge one up front price for a 100% unlocked game??? No IAPs??? Someone needs to do it!!!
B000VZFYDC|5.0|I have always liked this album. Great music to listen to. Not a bad price on the CD at amazon.
B0092ZEIN4|3.0|It connects and pairs fine to games that natively support it on My Droid razr m and nexus. It is easy to set up. My main issue with it is the analog sticks. They are really sliders,.which makes some games unplayable. Forget games like shadow gun and critical strike. It is impossible to play with these sliders. It is a frustrating experience. Certain emulator games are good with it. The sliders are also too small for My liking and require too much force to move
1781162646|5.0|This was the first full length Stephen King novel I ever read.  I grabbed it because of the noirish cover and the hard case crime publisher.  To say that I wasn't dissapointed would be the understatement of the century.  I really enjoyed this book and highly recommend it.  It's a coming of age story about a young college kid who gets his heart broken by picking the wrong girl and not reading the signals.  It's about this same kid leaving New England for a summer job at Joyland, a beAt up old amusement park on the Carolina shore.  That summer he learns the ropes as a carny.  And he hears from a fortune teller that he will meet two children, one with the gift of sight.  There is a haunted ride at the amusement park where a young teenager lost her life.  This young kid befriends the owner of the park.  He saves at least one life.  And he meets a fascinating child.  It is a haunting nostalgic tale that takes place in the early 70s and is told by a master storyteller.  If you read just one book this year, this should be the one.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|My wife is addicted to  this series. It provides a glimpse into the waning days of the aristocracy in post WWI Great Britain. We both enjoyed this series very much. Be prepared to be addicted.

1468179993|4.0|First line:<br /><br />\\"Spread your ideas\\"<br /><br />Good book with tips to help anyone deliver a good and motivating talk. A quick read.<br /><br />Thanks to netgalley
B0017I1IZA|5.0|All of Janet Evanovich,s books are GREAT.  I highly recommend all of them.  I LOVE LULU AND RANGERS CHARACTERS ESPECIALLY.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|You can see it in the dark and has a snooze. In love! It lets you have more than one and is easy to work.
B003274QH6|5.0|everyone has to have this in their &#34;BB&#34;collection, one of the best programs (maybe even better than &#34;Sopranos & Curb your enthusiasm&#34;) that gets my 5 star (6 star) rating.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The product is wonderful. One thing is that could you make it more easy to collect the Russian nesting dolls?
B004SIP9VA|5.0|Love it!  Richard Gere is wonderful in this part.  The dancing took my breath away.  The comedy part will make you laugh.  Story line is a little lacking, but to see the dancing -- that's what will make you watch it time and again!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|So addictive! I love it!!!! I am glad to find this because I love the games  when I go to the arcade and casino.<br /><br />W
B002CIY8EM|5.0|Will probably read several of his other boths.  The evedence he presents is very compeling. Hope we find alliens some day to prove him right.  This does test a persons faith, but still believe in a creator!!!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I love the way this was written and I loved the story. I did not predict the ending at all. There are parts to this story that I think were overdone but overall a good story.
B000T00KQA|5.0|To me Chet has the best delivery and overall performance of Jazz standards of any male vocalist in his genre.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|This game is very addictive.  Nothing or no one counts whenever I'm playing this game. It's like I'm in another world all to myself. I love it, love it, loooove it. If you're into games, go ahead and buy it. It's also very relaxing, so if you want to take something off your mind and concentrate on something else, just play this game. It's wonderful.
B009ZQFSRA|3.0|Just an ok flick. Good action but storyline a bit familiar to other movies.  Bad guy turns good guy. Pretty much a movie story that has been told many times before.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Fun game get lots of coins to do most things just don't get many acorns to do more. Kind of addictive though.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Old storyline that's been used in many movies.  Not a very sensible movie when heroine who is supposed to be a whiz in the woods climbs a tree when being chased up a tree and thus provides herself no other escape route..lame. You can only suspend reality so much to make the pieces of the movie logical. Too easy to figure out what happens.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Even though i don't really like the lead actresses acting, this was a pretty good movie. Entertaining and ya gotta love JT!
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|Good action with lots of futuristic tools for law enforcement.  But pretty much a &#34;crime doesn't pay&#34; theme throughout. Pretty standard stuff.
B0086DBE62|1.0|This has been on Netflix for awhile now but i wanted to watch it until they took it off of instant streaming, so i rented it on amazon. The movie just sucks, I couldn't even finish it and i always finish even crappy movies. Smh Julia Roberts
B009WUBERW|2.0|Just a very nonsense movie.  How these guys come up with weapons in the middle of nowhere simply amazes me.  Lame movie.

A+ for the DIRECTOR good job buddy you deserve a raise LOL!THE LAST STAND RULES NOW GIVE ME PART 2........
140006922X|5.0|Seems to be a well researched description of &#34;biblical&#34; time.  Excellent bibliography and reference sections.  Reads almost like a good novel.  Well paced and answers a lot of questions that the Bible only leaves unanswered.  I started it when I received it, putting another book aside, and finished it 5 days later.  When I wasn't doing routine stuff, I had this book in hand.  It is now circulating through a que.  I hope I get it back.  The line is long.  Found out about this almost by accident, having read about it in columns by writers from the Washington Post.  They were castigating an interview of the author by someone in FOX news.  Knowing how FOX news shades things in their own interest, I had to purchase the book.  Absolutely NO regrets. A permanent part of my library.  Thanks...
B00BB8VRPM|5.0|This movie was amazing.  Roberto Benigni definitely deserved best actor for this.  I will recommend this to everyone I know.
B004X80QNG|1.0|App continues to freeze/force close. If this issue is ever fixed I may change my opinion. However in the meantime I will continue to rely on Google Calendar.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Entertaining and challenging. Lots of floors with lots of different challenges. Looking forward to more updates and rooms to play.
B00E0MCYPS|5.0|The graphics in this game are top notch. The mountain of choices for steering, braking, and acceleration are incredibly excellent. The game is challenging enough for an adult, yet simple enough that my 4yo can play without getting bored. I love it.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|I loved this movie and have seen at least a dozen times in the past 30 years.  Acting, direction, props, costumes and some of the best screen play writing ever made make this the best movie of all time.
0439023491|5.0|Loved the book and the ending is so unpredictable! I would read this book over and over again, because it was do good
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|I'm no Trekie but even so this was a simply incredible show.  I was only going to watch 20min of it before bed and instead, watched the whole thing without even thinking of going to bed.
B005EWDA3I|4.0|good ending of  a delightful magical story. not as perfect as part one and two.<br />you complete enter and  believe this modern fairy tale, with lots of layers.
B00D6B4PUG|5.0|very convient to use on my kindle fire, my phone and deswk top computer all in sync- love it, love-it
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Best Ww2 Gun game. Its realistic and cool and just...... I can't even explain it just get it you have to!!!!!
B00992CF6W|4.0|This app needs to be updated and when i need to sine back in it says i<br />cant sine<br />in!
B008Q0D32S|3.0|The plot was slow to unravel.  This was too long and i got bored.  I like Charles b<br />Bronsons character the best.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Loved it! It was Awesome! Can't wait for The Avengers 2 to come out! Actioned packed! The whole family enyoed
1250010403|4.0|I bought what I thought was a complete series for my Kindle. Imagine my horror to get to the end of number 3 only to find it certainly was not the end, and now I am left hanging. I will certainly be first in line when number 4 hits the shelves.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This was a great book. Even though it is mostly for a younger audience still adults can enjoy it. The story line is very awesome and the ending!!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I would recommend this game to all my friends whom have an android. I play this game all the time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game and so does my daughter especially on long car rides. But you have to work hard to get an awesome board.
B00COGZ8FU|2.0|tom cruise was terrible Reacher!!!! no character development,movie was very disjointed. I can't believe Lee Child allowed this to be  done to his work
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Best game ever. Suggested for people who are looking for adventurous game's. Or anyone who is looking for a game
B001BKVWYG|5.0|This album came out in 1970 but I never heard it until I saw the movie &#34;Searching for Sugar Man.&#34;  He is unique, sucks you into his story and makes you play it over and over.
B00AREIAI8|2.0|I liked the idea of the game, but, it seems you have to make a purchase to continue the game. I thought the purchase was an option.<br />I did not sign up for make a purchase. Had difficulty with removing the game from the Kindle. Your tech person was very helpful
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Lucky for me, my friends turned me on to Sixto Rodriguez after they say the movie, Searching for Sugar Man.<br />I especially like &#34;I Think of You&#34; and &#34;Street Boy&#34;.  Also, check out &#34;Cold Fact&#34;.
B0030MM68O|5.0|The story, which has raw unadulterated action and deep psych elements, draws you in immediately.  Character development is superb and provides a believable balance of the ambiguous morality and internal conflict that naturally develops within teams of soldiers that are asked to do the unthinkable during wartime.  Renner delivers another awesome performance.
B00DV2D0JC|4.0|Am thoroughly enjoying this game. Combination of brain teasers and hidden objects. Well worth the price!  Looking forward to more games by G5.
B00C2C637I|5.0|Bradbury's writing engages all of the senses in a way few authors manage. And a sense of sinister circumstances permeates even the most prosaic descriptions of setting, characters, or plot. Simply excellent.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|It stores all your music from amazon so it is always available now I have it in my computer and my android,
B0036S4B6M|3.0|Writer seemed to want sympathy from reader.<br /><br />Writer seemed that she did not belong among the 'common prisoner'.<br /><br />Writer seemed that she was too good to go to jail.<br /><br />Writer seemed like since it was years and years since her wrong-doing, that the sentence should been minimal.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|What is currently pictured is not the same product I received.<br /><br />Being non-powered, I was skeptical at first, but the product has performed extremely well. The size is great as I use this hub with my Microsoft Surface Pro and to transfer photos via a USB 3.0 card reader. The transfer speeds are incredible and this really helps while on the road and I need a quick offload of photos from the memory card.
B00915G6MG|5.0|Everything I'm about to say is Redundant.  Excellent show, Excellent Cast.  I own all seasons, just bought Ten.  Looking forward to 11! I love listening for the 'odes to what's current' in each show. I've bought all the Music CDs and such. Haven't bought Bert the Hippo yet, but maybe soon.....OO-RAH!  To all NCIS fans!
B004W1GCNC|2.0|There are some good characters here, but the greatness of Downton Abbey outshines this by several miles. If you need a fix this is not it.
B00E0MCYPS|5.0|So far, I'm very impressed with this game.  I only played single race option.  I did not have the control issues others reported or the &quot;wrong way&quot; bug.  Tweaking the camera views to hood cam, I was able to win my second race.  Playing on a Nexus.  Great FAOTD!  If one of my coworkers or friends showed me this on their device, I would definitely buy.<br /><br />Will update if I come across any issues.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|love it on my kindle.  1 minute time limit different.  all though I see the point. I could keep playing with no end in sight.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love the game, but everything costs either money or energy and its never balanced. Overall a great game, especially for horse lovers!
B008JFUO4U|4.0|An Earth laid waste, debris and dust al around with one lone technician doing what he can to keep things running.  No, not Wall*E, but Tom Cruise as Jack (Tech 49) repairing the drones left behind to protect giant energy convertors, all that is left of use on Earth.  In this, Tech-49 is aided by Andrea Riseborough in their austere home in the clouds.  At the start of the movie, Jack is clearly more philosophical troubled by what they do than she is, but this is overshadowed by a greater disturbance in their routine when Jack finds a survivor, played by Olga Kurylenko, which forces Jack to reassess all he knows about his mission.<br />First off, the design is just fantastic.. it's a beautifully detailed world, a believably scorched earth in contrast with their sleek minimalist modern living environment.  It's clear that throw cushions and terracotta are not in fashion in the future.  Also, the director Joseph Kosinski ([[ASIN:B004K4IZ3G Tron: Legacy (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo)]]) has once again used a contemporary soundtrack which manages to be both epic and modern adding an energy to the movie that it might not have had with a more conventional symphonic score.<br />Tom Cruise never quite escapes being Tom Cruise, making it hard for us to invest in his character, but Andrea Riseborough more than makes up for it with a character so buttoned up that her expressions of emotion need only be the slightest of moments to make a great impact - it's a great performance.  Kurylenko never feels quite at home in her role here, but passes muster.  Morgan Freeman - well, who can say that watching Morgan freeman isn't a pleasure, but he is hardly stretched in what turns out to be quite a minor role.  Great entrance though, which focusses on his distinctive voice before he is revealed in person.  At the end of that short monologue, Freeman says `Lights' and the greater picture is revealed... and that sort of sums up the direction.  After every moment of characterisation, we swiftly move past to reach a reveal of some greater plot or art design, which sort of shows you where the director's heart really is.  He's more interested in the big ideas, than where his characters are coming from or going to.  Many of those ideas in the movie are not original - you get the feeling in the movie frequently of `Oh, that's just like in the movie `insert movie here'.. (it would be churlish to name the movie references and spoil the fun of finding them for yourself).  However, it's been put together in such a stylish way and with such conviction from the director, that it's a success.  Ultimately it's good to see stylish thoughtful sci-fi gracing the big screen, and I for one give it a thumbs up.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|Lana never fails to amaze me. She's so unique and her voice and music are beautiful. Can't wait for more from her.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love it its the first time I found a spider game I liked that was not on the compter yea
B00ATPVA78|5.0|I've downloaded some really bad games recently trying to find another like Lost Souls or Special Inquiry. This game is it. I would love to see a lot more games like these.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|This movie was well worth the money, both at the box office and the video version of it.  The Enterprise, as usual, takes a beating.
B008OM0EDO|3.0|Not as funny as I had heard. More rude than funny. Good for a few laughs and wasting time. Lots of bad acting too.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|What a great story. Real life shows the power of Gods work. What a brave young man and a brave family.
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|Not much of a plot or good special effects.Good for wasting some time. The old one was better. You don't even see Dredd's face.
140006922X|5.0|I was brought up a staunch Catholic, but left the Church, along with my family, when I was 17. I have learned a lot in the ensuing years, but this book has opened my eyes to so much that I never knew. It may have elements that are called into question by Biblical scholars ([...] but those make decidedly small dents in a much larger picture. Thank you Reza Aslan for opening my eyes and for radically changing my view of much of the foundations upon which our current world has been built.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like its kind of fun.  Not the best game, but it keeps me busy on my free time and work.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Orange is the New Black was eye-opening and provocative. It prompted me to take another look at how putting nonviolent offenders behind bars is not only expensive in economic terms, but can be devastating in human costs, as well-
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a really well done production.  I enjoy watching Maggie Smith in her role. Can't wait for next season.<br />t
B004UPANAI|5.0|It is a good movie, Hugh Jackman is a great actor and soooooooooooooooooooooo good looking and in incredible good shape!!!
0802130208|5.0|The book is a masterpiece! That said, I suppose I can understand how a very few may not like the story and/or the characters, but claiming that the book is poorly written is utterly ridiculous. Having lived in New Orleans, I can tell you that the dialogue is spot on.  I think the book is hilarious. And would highly recommend it
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This is a sweet story that really pulled me along. The writer alternated the chapters with a peek into the character's life as child which gave the whole story more meaning and helped to create a feeling of compassion. I fell in love with the character.
B0042UEU8M|2.0|I hesitated between 2 and 3 stars. May be I was just not the target audience of this movie. However the theme is relevant to most of us, so I don't think this was the issue. The actors are fine, the storyline is fine as well, the esthetic is more than fine, so may be it went wrong at editing. Honestly, I am not sure.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|It was a wonderful story but  almost too graphic times.  The only problem I had was that it was very difficult to follow. It switched back and forth between different story lines. It was almost like you were reading not only what was happening but what the characters wanted to happen. It was difficult to tell them apart.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|This is a well done series. It had an excellent story line that makes you keep wanting to watch the next episode,. I can't wait to see how the current story line ends.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|If you are looking for a quality action movie this one rates low. But I did enjoy it for what it was. You can't forget that this is a movie inspired by dolls for boys. Dwayne Johnson and Bruce Willis are really great and definitely help this silly story along. So there you have it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I just downloaded the app. I do think it is quit a bit of fun. I'm sure my munchkins are going to love it...that is if I give it up.
B009WUBERW|3.0|If you are having trouble agreeing on a movie for a mixed company crowd, i.e. testosterone and estrogen, this will work.
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|This app makes streaming to all my devices in the house a simple process that involves no headaches. Just install the server on the machine that has all the media and then connect all your other devices via your wifi network!
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I lovers this movie!  If you are a Star Trek fan it lives up to every expectation.  Action pack with a great story line.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|This is a serious, beautifully acted and directed police drama with interesting psychological insights. Can't wait to see the whole serie.
0321934962|5.0|When I get a new camera I always look for the &#34;From Snapshots to Great Shots books, great training aid
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Only second day but so far the game has kept me entertained. I don't like how it forces you to use specials in tutorial.
B004TTMYQG|1.0|This is not a one time login to activate... You must be continuously logged into the Amazon  app store for it to function  at all. When I first bought this app it didn't do this. I want my money back. Forget about using it on an airplane or if you are in a meeting room without an Internet connection... Which is common at my work. It should be against Appstore rules to change the conditions of using an app.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|This bluray/DVD combo showed up at my door only few days after my purchase. It was in a perfect state. Everything's perfect !
B004GYY714|4.0|I use it to hear special programs when I am out and about. Some times changes stations on its own, but overall it works well.
B00EQNYOYU|5.0|I'm not good with details when describing music. But the vocals are on point. I love the rock/electronica/ drum n bass aspect. Everything blends together so well. The music just sounds great. Rock is still dead, but this has to be the best rock album to come out in the past 7/ 8 years I would think. If you like hard music this is for you.  Nine inch nails is definitely back with this album. When you can listen to an album straight through you know it's dam good. And I haven't done that in ages. I'm always picking what singles to download because most music is terrible on most albums. This is not, it's worth the price. Buy it you won't be disappointed.
B00DVKOYBM|3.0|Not enough time for some shots. Many times the game player runs the table before I get a chance to make any shots.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|Had a lot of action and a decent plot for a Judge Dredd movie. Acting was a little bland at times.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|Regarding Lady Gaga we usually expect too much and maybe end up disappointed, it was what happened to me when first listened to Applause. However, after listening three to four times, I realized how good this song is! Totally recommend.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This app is just so soothing after a hard day at work a jigsaw helps me unwind much healthy than a large gin and tonic
B0013ND30M|5.0|Must have for a little girl! The movie is good and we enjoy it I like the fairies they keep things upbeat it is kind of dark but overall it is a good movie to have
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Well done, exciting and erotic!  Read it before the movie comes out. The pictures in your mind will exceed anything Hollywood can come up with!
B0001I561E|5.0|Aladdin is a good movie that does not get old, the music is upbeat and the characters are great it is a true masterpiece
B002VECM72|5.0|This is a wonderful movie based on a true story.  We loved the movie from start to finish. This movie shows that you can overcome<br />obstacles in your life regardless of how bad your life may have been.  Beautiful, beautiful story!!!!
B00335EQ0E|5.0|This is a good Disney movie we all love it and no the remake cannot compare to it so get this you will like it
B002YCVX5S|5.0|Quentin Tarantino has made yet another amazing movie.  His over the top style of action has always been really entertaining to watch.
B0007KTBIU|3.0|This is the better of the two movies the characters are fun and it is worth watching as a family
B00E0MCYPS|5.0|Replays your game as a movie, very cool<br />Smash into another car<br />Fast pace and a variety of driving options
B000OLGCI4|4.0|Not the best of Disney in my eyes and my kids do not care for it I watched it once and put it on the shelf and I don't believe it is moving!
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Has all the characters. It's what you'd expect. Solid watch. Won't blow you away! It's something I wouldn't mind watching again.
B000AAF1U4|1.0|I don't think we ever watched the whole thing because it sucked for all of us pass on it it is not even well known
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|The book is intriguing. It keeps me wanting to turn the pages. The perspectives of all the characters and their interconnected lives is what kept me interested.
B00973902K|4.0|My daughter likes this song so I got it for her but I also enjoy hearing it once in awhile it is pretty catchy
B00AEBBA1I|5.0|This movie looks outstanding on bluray except for the opening shot looks grainy other than that the picture is perfect, Johnny Depp makes some of my favorite movies and i chose this cause it looked very good and it is. this is probably the only musical i can watch!
B001KVZ6FW|3.0|This movie is different but it is fun for the kids they have talking dogs which is probably the only good character but if you are not interested in movies with death stay away
B0037VNX44|1.0|Very depressing movie.  Needed more depth as to why Bronson was the way he was. Not much of a story line.
B001ILFUD2|3.0|This movie has a lot of singing and the movie is overall good but my kids do not care for it and that is what matters
B0049J3QNG|5.0|Great, my grandson loves it!!! He loves watching it and would watch it over and over. What a great movie!
B0030IIYYS|5.0|This movie rocks and it is the best one Jessie is introduced and Buzz is already here we watch this one the most and love it
B005H9B2CE|3.0|it has very common graphic tec. you may enjoy it. I hope you had a good time with your family but your friend or girlfriend.
B00003CXCQ|4.0|Must have all the princess movies for the girl this is Disney's first animated movie and it is a good one. The animation is not the best but it was like the 20's or so. Get this one
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|I am not a big fan of &#34;Empire&#34;. It sounds too pop to me. The next album, &#34;Promised Land&#34; is just okay too, but as &#34;Empire&#34; It has good moments. I love &#34;Warning&#34;, &#34;Rage for Order&#34; and &#34;Operation: Mindcrime&#34;. Nothing else can be compared to this 3 albums, nothing. Queensryche became something without identity, Geoff Tate became a weird crazy guy, doing and talking stupid things. Most of the fans lost the respect for him, and It was sad to see, a band that I loved, to be destroyed by a big ego or a mental issue. Then I saw online the Rising West videos on YouTube and I got so excited, I went to a concert in Toronto and I LOVED what I saw, but I wanted to listen the CD and I bought it and I have to say: IT IS GREAT! It is much better than anything released after &#34;Promised Land&#34;... No, it is much better than anything released after &#34;Operation: Mindcrime&#34;. Queensryche is a band again, a great band and I love it again.
B000AY74OG|5.0|We love this movie and find it fun and entertaining. The plot is good and the characters are fun and worth watching
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is by far one of the best series on TV.  Am so looking forward to the 4th season.  I have watched Seasons 1 and 2 at least twice...and am hoping that ON DEMAND puts Season 3 up...so I can watch it yet again.  It has everything...drama, humor, historical significance, and the venue is gorgeous.  Definitely a must by anyone's standards.
B001HN6922|5.0|We love this one it is better than the first one I think because we know the main characters and it has a lot of Mater in it which we love, Plus there asre spy cars! Best for the boys
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Not a bad game. Graphics are so so. It's a typical level based hack and slash. All in all though pretty good.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|I can't believe this movie is not well known. It is set in New Orleans and not only is the story original the characters are great and entertaining, the music rocks, and everything is right I can watch this again and agian with or without the kids! Must watch this once
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Both mine and my husband's most used app on our phones and tablets alike. Very practical and helpful for anyone.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|This is like a number one for all Disney movies I just watched it, AGAIN! We love this movie and have all the characters as well The music is on our MP# and this is probably one if not the best Disney movie
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book was a page turner...Loved all the characters and the way they all rolled together, I would definately read another book by her.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Works well for what I want it to do. Allows me to read all of my pdfs on the go
B00881VLCE|3.0|Can take a long time to load compared to other games. It's fun and challenging. Some were times pieces would not move; Times where I hit ads accidentally and game freezes--luckily it saves every move.
B00D3LA5WG|5.0|Very good movie, excellent acting and plot development. A little dark , but it made the movie more real. Watch it.
B005P1YCNK|5.0|Down to earth, easy to read, easy to do, easy not to do. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to change habits and succeed in life whether personally or professionally. Love Darren Hardy!
B00746O3X8|1.0|I gave this product one star because during my first time using it (At a High School Football game) the Right hip holster part came off. if it hadn't been for the support straps my camera would have been destroyed. A Further inspection revealed the the weight of the camera had caused the stitching to come apart. I had a D300 with a 70-200 f2.8. I was VERY surprised when I noticed this. Please invest in something more worth while. Guess I got what I paid for. :/
B001XUPH9K|5.0|Wrath of Kahn is arguably one of the best movies starring the original cast.  That would probably explain why the new reboot of the franchise chose it for a plot outline.
B008EEZ64Y|4.0|I'm not sure why I would want to review this with the exception it is wondrous, intriguing and leaving you to want more. My only complaint is the ending that of course leaves you wanting more and as such will get the following books. I suppose the theme is something that may call to many of us...but after living 65 years and seeing the changes in the world, I can't imagine wanting to live in this society. Very Orwellian/Hitchcock to me.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This was fun, but could have been a little longer.  Very satisfying game play that requires more thought than skill.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Brain loves the challenge!<br /><br />Exercises the old noggin. Great graphics and hours of fun. Play very frequently and not bored yet.<br /><br />::
B008YKGQR4|1.0|Sloppy and ugly,,,but it is full.  Full of sidebars and ads.  Keep the free download, it looks a lot nicer and is ten times easier to control.
B006BGZJJ4|2.0|This cable is very very weak, it doesn't stay plugged in the outlet, won't hardly connect to the Kindle I think it charging just to find out it has not.ive had to wrap the cord around the kindle in order for it to charge.
B009ZQJ1G4|2.0|It just was not the kind of movie that I personaly like. The movie was like a reproduction of Big Brother. Maybe you could say that it hit a little close to home.
B000002PCS|5.0|What can one say about something that is so beautiful? The music is fantastic and is orchestrated in a way that takes the listener on a journey that is &#34;somewhere in time.&#34; Breathtaking, and can be listened to while visualizing the movie scenes in one's mind.<br />Will definitely recommend this product.
B00B4VI8MQ|2.0|this does seem like a great game but the appstore says the game is free you get into the plot and then bam !you get a message that you have to pay to keep playing boo! i say boo!
B00A285OOW|3.0|This book continues with the story of what occured after the Cousins War.  In my opinion, Elizabeth &#34;The White Princess&#34; is a very passive character living with a King who has won his crown but yet is not beloved by his people.  I would have liked to know more of her relationship with the king once his mother passed.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Awesome, read the book non stop, till I finished. I love this series. I can't wait for the movie to come out.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Getting ready to watch Ep. 6. Just a real shame there are only 8 all together. The other series could learn something from this wonderfully written show! Tune in, you won't be the least bit sorry.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Awesome game.  I get caught up in it and play for hours.  Graphics are good and I just love that monkey.
B00ENNA62W|5.0|I remember the first time I watched this movie; I was hanging out with my best friend at his house and he popped this into the VCR. His copy of the movie had already degraded to a noticeable point where everything had darkened and turned soft. Within five minutes of the movie starting there was no darkness, only bright vivid violence and sharp dreamlike scenes that spoke to me even at a young age. After the film ended I borrowed the cassette from my friend and proceeded to degrade the film even more. I watched it over and over again. It was easy to get lost in the world Otomo had created and then put so expertly to film. I purchased my own DVD copy of Akira when I was in high school but something was off. It took me a few minutes but then I realized it was the voices. They had changes the English dubbed voices. They weren't bad but they weren't what I grew up with. I still watched it a few times on DVD but it wasn't the same. When I eventually moved in with that same best friend at college I wasn't even mad that he borrowed my DVD set and left them sensitive side up in his room and then fleas from a cat he had brought into our house had fleas and they left nasty blotches all over my discs making them useless. Time passed and I complained from time to time about the voice change when the movie came up but I figures it was just the way things would alway be. And then another friend told me about this rerelease. I am so happy about this. I can't wait to watch it with my kids and hopefully they will find somethings to love about this amazing movie as well. I love this movie; I always will.
B00CWVF2GC|4.0|Actually three and a half stars for this movie.  Yossi is a sad sweet movie with a happy ending!  Very good acting by all characters. The story line is plausible although ten years of grieving is a bit of a stretch  to believe. Not a lot of skin and or sex but very enjoyable movie.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Great show, free for Amazon Prime! Definitely worth a watch if you haven't seen it. Just make sure you have some free time cause you'll be hooked!
B00499K9E0|5.0|This is one of the best TV shows or movies I have enjoyed in such a long time. I have always been a fan of Sherlock Holmes since childhood and am very critical of attempts to recreate the classic Basil Rathbone shows, but this is a horse of a different color. I have shared it with everyone I know. Fast paced and entertaining. Give it a try.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This book is God sent to me I had never heard of the four agreements I'm making  a choice to Live like Heaven here on earth.<br />Thank You !<br />Don Miguel
B008XX6J4C|5.0|If you want to listen to more modern music, but also like instrumental, this is the CD for you.  Not only Piano, but many instruments
B00594XOZU|5.0|This app is so great it tells u when u sent it when it delivered it and if they read it and when ur texting some one, it tells u when their typing u can add any one u can change ur chat bubble color u can have a profile pic too u should get this app i guarantee you will love it!!! But some times it takes a while to deliver it but its still a great app!!!
B0063IH60K|2.0|I don't like the size...its to small for me to see well. Should be able to enlarge game to larger size.
B009HNDSL4|3.0|The jokes seem forced and cartoonish and the characters are becoming caricatures of themselves.  I am only halfway through, and I hear it gets better by the end.  I will revise my rating of that happens.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I watched this show in its entirety when it was on TV, and this is my second time around.  I am enjoying it as much as ever.  I admire Dorcas, very much a woman ahead of her time, and the rest of the characters are equally engaging.  The dresses the ladies wear, especially Dorcas, are beautiful.  The town and country setting contrasts two ways of life, and I find this show to be utterly charming.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a really great game. There is a lot of variety in the things you can do. Best of all is that you can earn coins and gems (you don't have to buy them) to get more horses and tack for the horses, You can even get other locations for your horse to be pastured in.<br />It's a lot of fun and easy enough for even younger kids to play with a little bit of help.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|This is a fun game with beautiful graphics. Don't like the timed searches. They are always wanting you to buy game pieces for real money, but you can earn enough on your own to play. From what I can see this game will be never ending. I really Don't care for searching the same spaces over and over for the same things (just in different places). Especially in the dark! I've had some problems with the game freezing up or kicking me out. I much prefer G5 games like Snark Busters.
1589795474|5.0|AMAZING read!  Life changing and eye opening about the typical millionaire. This book really takes a look at the normal everyday millonaire and breaks down how they see money and grow their wealth. I desire to be a PAW!
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|Season 1 was slow and poor writing but season 2 is much better. Good character development and writing is much better.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|being  a trek fan i have seen all the movies old and new.  and i must say i found this one just as fun and thrilling as the last movie.  I also was able to pick up a few things from the wrath of khan.  but with a new twist.  i must say well done.  i hope there is another .  because i will be viewing it also. again i say well done
0446547654|5.0|The most beautiful Love Story I have ever read.  I realize it is Fiction but I totally got into the story anyway, I cried  I laughed but most of all I believed the story.  Nicholas Sparks is a wonderful writer.  It will always be with me this beautiful story.
B0045HCIZY|5.0|After receiving the DVD, watched the movie for the first time since its release in the '90s & was struck at how well done it was. Not just a love story, but a meditation on how ephemeral life is.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Great show love the characters abd the story line. Can not wait for the next season to start. Lovethe show
B0064Y5U24|4.0|I got this a week ago and haven't stopped listening to it.  The more upbeat songs are towards the beginning, but all in all it's a good purchase.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|wonderful app great and awsome it is so fun and better than before. love it so much buy now cool
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Perfect Alarm and timer. Only thing to add is a stop watch which I may have overlooked. Amazing this is
B007VUA7VO|5.0|One of the first apps I downloaded, and one of the most useful. Good clean graphic, and - so far as I can tell - accurate guide to how much power your Kindle still has. And it's FREE, of course.
B009RX85N0|4.0|The show just keeps getting better and better as you watch it.  Additional characters and story arcs just keep up your interests and wondering 'what will happen and who did this or that' in the progression of each episode.  I admit when my husband and I first started watching the first season on Netflix we thought it was sort of cheesy and the acting inconsistent but we pressed ahead from the first episodes and found out that the show just gets better and better as you watch each episode.  We both actually enjoy watching it now and we are on the last episode of the second season.  I like this season alot with the addition of Hook, Cora, Mulan, Neal (Emma's love interest from the past), Tiny and other various characters that spice up the episodes.  I enjoy immensely the set designs and the BEAUTIFUL costumes the characters get to wear in fairytale land.  So pretty and the male characters, especially Hook, have some very well made costumes, as well.  Take it from my husband and me, the show is so worth pressing ahead and continuing to watch because, as I said already, it is worth it... Thanks and I hoped that helps...
B00AJLHUYO|2.0|This movie has some excellent acting by some very talented people, an interesting plot and some very nasty moments.  However when all was put together it became a bore.
B000XUBF3I|5.0|This book reteaches everyone to take everything in simple uncomplicated steps. One step at a time, as Celley says one baby step at a time. It is all so simple no need to embellish anything or add to. Just follow the simple rules and it really works!
B002UM5BXW|3.0|Entertaining but a little over the top. Not all believable. A nice summer read. The author does not take himself too seriously .
0143037757|5.0|I have difficulty thinking up in the moment ways that this book could be improved, but I can think of many ways in which it could have been worse. The subject, post-war Europe, is huge. Surely there are thousands, if not tens of thousands of books that pertain directly to the topic.<br /><br />Listening through the book over the span of a month, I seldom felt the author was giving too much information, or too little information, the amount seemed just right. The prose not rhetorical or ideological, but also not academic or with a pretentious air of objectivity.<br /><br />I got the sense that this work was indeed a labor of love. The quality of the writing is consistent  throughout the periods of time, and nations that are covered. Topics do not appear written about so as to maintain an image of inclusiveness, but because there is genuine meaning in the topics.<br /><br />I got the impression of not only a factual grasp of the topics, but an intuitive grasp. That the author has thought quite considerably at leisure about what is covered.<br /><br />Being broadly familiar with the topic I learned nothing completely new to me while reading, however my understanding of dozens of political events was refreshed, and often made more refined. I knew of course how Communists took power in Eastern European countries, but after reading I got a sense of how that was able to happen. Likewise with the collapse of communism, I was happy to have knowledge, country by country, of what happened in the early 1990s.<br /><br />I would have liked more pages centered on Europe's economic development, but cannot find fault with the author for his choices of emphasis. Much time is spent discussing the intellectual appeal of Marxism and communism, but I don't feel the author succeeds entirely in explaining the phenomenon.<br /><br />The only historical error I caught was claiming that over 200,000 Germans were killed in their forced expulsion from Czechoslovakia (The real figure is closer to 15,000). No doubt there are other factual errors,but such is basically unavoidable for any book of this scope.to 15,000). No doubt there are other factual errors,but such is basically unavoidable for any book of this scope.
1933952806|5.0|Above and beyond! EVERYTHING this camera does is explained in fine detail and easy to understand for someone who is new to photography. I bought the camera for self enjoyment, I knew next to nothing about all that goes into it. This was very helpful!!!! I bought this vs taking a continuing education class, i am sure i learned more with this book than what the class offered. Thank you Darrell!
B00607EWYC|5.0|Tinkers is one of the most beautifully written books I've ever read. It reads like poetry. It took my breath away.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book had lots of twists and secrets. Very good read!<br />I would recommend this book to friends and can't wait to another one of her books.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|I always kind of thought what is the point of playing magic without it being an excuse for being able to hang out with friends face to face.  The idea of pre-made decks for you takes away a lot of the fun too.  I just tried the trial of this but it already let me see that this can be a really fun way to pass the time if all you have is your kindle and time on your hands (say when your girlfriend just wants to go in to the store &#34;really quick&#34;).  The controls are well planned out and allow time for instants all stages of play.  You can get your strategy on and the opponents can be difficult requiring you to pick out the correct deck.  The best part...  There is a play mode where you open up 10 or so booster packs and have to build your own deck.  Defeat opponents to get more packs.  Of coarse you have to buy the full version to play anything more than the first opponent in this mode or more than the first stage of the game.  Something I just may do.
B00E0MCYPS|5.0|this game is so cool u need to get it u can drife  and u can pick your one car
0345803485|2.0|What can i say? This thing doesn't deserve a review. Not $ worth, unless your in to bad writing. CRAP!!!
B004SIP8JI|5.0|Wonderful chemistry between Meg Ryan and Hugh Jackman!  The movie is funny, romantic, action packed all in one.  A great movie!
B00821OW8K|1.0|After Lincoln and this thing, Spielberg needs to spend a lot more time on his billion dollar yacht.<br /><br />Just awful character development, and especially awful writing. Pope was the only colorful, interesting character. The true test of bad writing is when you don't care about any of the characters after 4 or 5 episodes.<br /><br />Yes, it could have been very good, but... it wasn't.<br /><br />This makes you appreciate The Walking Dead and Firefly all the more.
B001XCWPAM|5.0|We just love the Bourne series.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|good its free my daughter can play it in her kindle fire sometimes I wish there is more free games
B001NA6096|2.0|Had to be one of the most boring shows I have ever watched.  It was a total waste of time.
B00846REIS|5.0|A keep you on your seat kind of book. I could not put it down. Looking forward to the next one in this series.
B009ZW9DU2|5.0|Liked how easy this was to read. Interesting to read about how an animal can change how humans can be affected by their antics.
B004A7OQKY|1.0|Skip this video and find another video. This appears to be a poorly filmed home video. Definitely do not recommend.
B004SKHJF2|5.0|Love this ! it's awesme!! can't believe I got it for FREE on the deal of the day!! yippee yippee
B00D6B4PUG|3.0|It is good for quick checks and email updates. If major typing is required, it may not be convenient. Just my thoughts.
B005G5PPGS|4.0|I'm not a baseball fan but this book has given me a new perspective and a deep appreciation for those who love the game. When I don't understand something, my husband is helpful. With this new insight, I plan on watching the next game played.
B007SSF3O0|5.0|A feel-good movie. Funny, witty, and romantic. Nothing bad. Just a good movie to watch before bed so that you don't have weird dreams :)
0553386794|4.0|I'm a bit late to the party on this book and series. When HBO created a television series based on it last year, approximately everyone and their mother promptly became obsessed with it. A friend of mine lent me this book and the second in the series and I was inundated with questions every time I talked to him: \\"Have you read Game of Thrones yet? Well, when are you going to read Game of Thrones? You know you need to read Game of Thrones, right?\\"<br /><br />I finally picked it up. And I'm not going to lie to you, this book is hefty and one intimidating sucker at 835 pages.<br /><br />Martin circulates through multiple points of view as he sets the book up. And when I say multiple, I mean multiple. There are a lot of friggin' characters in this book and it would take time to set up the world from the point of view of just one person.<br /><br />I think this is why, for around the first one or two hundred pages, I really struggled with A Game of Thrones. I kept putting it down. Because I really, really wanted to like it but those first two hundred pages- gah. They dragged. I felt like nothing exciting was happening and I dreaded picking the tome (yes, it deserves that title) again.<br /><br />But I muscled through after many people encouraged me. And I am so very glad that I did. Because after around 200 pages, s*** gets real. There are political plots that seem to be making progress, people who are possibly insane, war, grief, and death. Oh and these spooky as hell creatures that we barely get to see but I fully expect to terrify the bejeesus out of me in future books in the series.<br /><br />I don't like everything about every character, but I love that that's realistic. We see the fatal flaws of Martin's characters glaringly and one point of view is from someone that I usually want to throw things at when I see her from someone else's eyes.<br /><br />Overall rating: 4/5. A struggle to read in the beginning that ultimately ended up worth it. I will definitely be reading Book 2. And watching the HBO series. Soon.<br /><br />- See more at: [...].    - See more at: [...]
B008602KQI|4.0|Of course this movie is intriguing, just like the book. The only downfall is that the story line has children killing each other which is a bit grotesque.
014241543X|4.0|I read If I Stay in a single night. Fitting, since the events of If I Stay take place over about 24 hours.<br /><br />It's easy, languid reading that was simple to fall into, but the emotions that it pulled from me weren't easy by any stretch of the imagination. In a word, If I Stay was heart-wrenching.<br /><br />We barely know Mia when tragedy strikes her and her family. Through Forman's use of flashbacks interspersed with the present, we get to know both Mia and her family; we come to truly understand what she's lost and grieve with her.<br /><br />Besides the relationships with her parents and little brother, Mia also has a best friend, a boyfriend, pseudo-family, and other family members. And we get to know them through flashbacks as well. We laugh at Kim and Mia's friendship beginnings even as we admire Kim's current bravery. We \\"watch\\" the arc of Adam and Mia's relationship while he's trying to get in to see her in the hospital. We swoon over tiny moments like hand-holding and first dates while we pray that current Mia holds on. I cooed over how, despite some differences, Adam and Mia were still perfect for each other and I got caught up in worrying over a schooling decision that Mia struggled with... before I was zapped back to the present moment and remembered that Mia has a much bigger, much more important decision to deal with now. The anecdotal flashbacks show both character and relationship development and they were executed really effectively.<br /><br />Really, it's astonishing how many different levels of love Gayle Forman effectively covers in If I Stay. Familial, friendship, and romantic. But Mia still has another love and that love is the cello. I don't have words for how deeply this part touched me. The fact that Mia has such an intense passion is something that readers will undoubtedly relate to. Her passion for her instrument and music is so intense and was one of the aspects of the book that moved me to tears.<br /><br />Finally, there was theidea of the choice that Mia had to make. I loved Forman's exploration of the topic, how Mia deals with it and how she watched her love ones process the idea. I won't tell you how it ends... only that while Forman could have taken a thousand cliched routes, she instead chose the perfect resolution.<br /><br />Overall rating: 4/5. Incredibly touching and emotional, If I Stay is a great choice for a quick catharsis.<br /><br />- See more at: [...]
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This is a great book. I bought this book for my son who is entering into the 9th grade for Summer reading project. I also read it and I really enjoyed it.
1250007208|5.0|I have literally been looking forward to this book for years. I grew up reading Meyer's Sailor Moon fanfiction and followed her livejournal account of her writing adventues. She was one of my favorite fanfiction authors. I think I can safely remove the word \\"fanfiction\\" from that title after reading Cinder. Meyer's become one of my favorite authors, full stop, with her debut novel.<br /><br />As one could probably infer from the title, Cinder is a futuristic reimagining of the fairy tale of Cinderella. The tale begins when Prince Kai asks Cinder to repair his android and, in the very same day, plague strikes close to home. Enjoy the quiet peace of the first few pages of the novel. Things quickly turn into a roller coaster ride of a book.<br /><br />The relationship between Kai and Cinder is one that you really have to appreciate. Unlike so many other books out there, it isn't part of the insta-love phenomenon that is (the bane of my existence) a little unrealistic. We grow to know both Kai and Cinder in their own right, understand the various pressures that they both find themselves under. And then, we see that seed of attraction that we can spot early on grow.<br /><br />There is definitely enough romance to make lovers of it swoon, but I also loved being taken along for Cinder's ride full of self-discovery. She learns things about her mysterious past that I never saw coming, and Meyer threw twist after twist that just left me reeling.<br /><br />And let's have a look at Meyer's world-building for a moment: It's more than fitting that for a futuristic novel, the villains are ones that we can't even find on earth. It's fitting also that the unusual \\"draft\\" only affects cyborgs who aren't considered entirely human because of technology, and that arguably Cinder's closest friend is an android named Iko (I totally want an android like Iko to give me fashion advice, by the way. She was adorable!). The way that the day-to-day technology is written, such as \\"coms\\" or \\"netscreens,\\" makes it seem day-to-day. I was never wondering what exactly they did, every device just seemed like something that belonged there.<br /><br />Fair warning, the book ends on a wicked cliffhanger. You will want Book 2: Scarlet in hand promptly and, if you're like me, will want to thrash around on the floor, beating your fists, crying \\"WHY?!\\" as in \\"WHY don't I have Scarlet yet?!\\"<br /><br />But it's worth it. Meyer's writing has all of the charm of a traditional fairy tale with the extra zap! of technology and wonderful characters to give it pizazz.<br /><br />Overall rating: 5/5. I have a new favorite series. Move this book to the top of your TBR pile NOW. But don't come crying to me over the cliffhanger please. I'm just barely recovering myself.<br /><br />- See more at: [...]
B001NLL0RW|4.0|Someone should pick this series of novels for either movies or TV series. These books could make a up and coming actor a name.
1423141997|4.0|In the previous installment of the Heroes of Olympus series, we learned that Percy Jackson, much like Jason in The Lost Hero, has lost his memory and is at a camp for demigods that he's never known of: Camp Jupiter. As with most of the books in both The Heroes of Olympus series and the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series, we begin at the camp (though the Roman camp operates very differently from Camp Half-blood) before embarking upon a seemingly impossible quest.<br /><br />Rick Riordan never misses an ingredient in his books.<br /><br />Adventure? We've got that in spades as Percy and his new friends, Frank and Hazel take on monsters, Amazons, gorgons, and giants on their quest.<br /><br />Serious shtuff? Well let's see. Both Frank and Hazel have had issues with their families, Percy can't remember the rest of his life, and there's that itty-bitty little \\"Gaia's trying to take over the world\\" thing they've got to contend with...<br /><br />Romance? Got that too, just a bit. Annabeth is all that Percy really remembers and... well, I don't want to spoil you. Let's just say that's a pinch more crushiness (I'm making up words now, deal with it) than that.<br /><br />And humor? Um, hello? Percy's back and he's always been sarcastic and a little hilarious. Frank and Hazel aren't missing a sense of humor either. When the mood gets a little darker it doesn't last long, one of them will either crack a joke or Riordan will throw in a hilarious villain to break it without interrupting the flow of the story.<br /><br />Basically, The Son of Neptune did not disappoint.<br /><br />Overall Rating: 4.5/5. Greek mythology lovers and fans of Harry Potter (especially the earlier books) are sure to love this Middle Grade series.<br /><br />- See more at: [...]

0525478817|5.0|This can't be appropriately called a review. How can I properly review a book that touched me as deeply as The Fault in Our Stars did? I even considered making a special format purely for this book before I decided to stick with the tried and true.<br /><br />Looking for Alaska was the only John Green book that I'd read before. And don't get me wrong. I loved it. It was beautifully written and literary and I think I summed it up with the word \\"wow.\\" But it didn't touch me the way that The Fault in Our Stars did. I just- I don't know how to say it better than other people have said it already. That Jodi Picoult blurb on the front? 100% agree.<br /><br />I had a favorite quote from this book that I think sums up how I felt about it: \\"I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, then all at once.\\" I was falling in love with this book- with Hazel, with Augustus Waters, with how they interpret and describe the world around them. And before I knew it, I was in. There was no getting out of how I felt about the book and the characters and it all culminated in about 100 pages of mascara running down my faces as I huddled in my bed with a tissue and this book.<br /><br />I always vaguely want to thank authors for writing- because obviously I love to read. But I want to thank John Green for writing something that made me feel ALL THE THINGS.<br /><br />Overall rating: 5/5. Like my initial 1 sentence Goodreads review said: \\"John Green gets ALL the stars.\\"<br /><br />- See more at: [...]
B006LSZECO|5.0|Page turner with no clue to how it will end.  This will make a great movie.  If you like the writing of Chuck Palahniuk and Jodi Picoult all rolled into one, this is the book for you.
0142421715|4.0|When I first read Matched, the first book in this trilogy, I really didn't keep up with book news and the like. I recalled hearing a title mentioned and that was good enough for me, so I checked it out from the library. So imagine my reaction when I arrived at the end of the book, having loved it, and realized it was the first in a trilogy... and neither of the next books had been published yet.<br /><br />It went something like this: \\"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\\"<br /><br />So you can imagine that I was THRILLED when I won a copy before the release date from Sash and Em. I wasn't so thrilled when I couldn't get to it RIGHT AWAY.<br /><br />The setting of Crossed was a little different from Matched. Yes, they both take place within The Society's rule, but we've left our days of polite Society (ha, see what I did there?) in Oria behind. Cassia and Ky are both on the run, though not together.<br /><br />I don't know what it is about being in the wilderness (or simulated wilderness) in a dystopian series, but I love it. I think that's why Mockingjay is my least favorite in The Hunger Games trilogy, and Uglies is my favorite in the Uglies trilogy. I therefore suspect for that reason that Crossed may wind up my favorite book in the Matched trilogy.<br /><br />The love triangle between Ky, Cassia, and Xander is still alluded to in Crossed, but it wasn't quite the be-all, end-all that it was in Matched. Cassia's pretty much made her choice, but in her own way she does love Xander too. I am crossing my fingers that this triangle isn't made a huge deal again in the third book.<br /><br />Crossed is told in alternating points of view which was new. I was used to seeing the world only from Cassia's perspective and while I liked seeing what Ky was up to it could be a bit jarring and disorienting. I usually skip reading chapter headings, so when I flipped the page and therefore POVs it took me a minute to realize it since they're both written in the first person and the same tense.<br/><br />Much like in Matched, Crossed uses poetry and the arts to get its points across. Poetry, stories, paintings... none of them are created any longer. Only one hundred of each of them have been saved from pre-Society days, which makes the ones that have been saved beyond those, forbidden. This is one of the most chilling ideas to me in the Society and I truly love how Ally Condie gets the point across that art is still valuable and even essential.<br /><br />Overall rating: 4/5. I enjoyed Crossed even more than its predecessor Matched. I am very eagerly anticipating the as yet Untitled 3rd book in the trilogy, expected in some time 2012.<br />- See more at: [...]
B000I9U8VO|5.0|XMen was my favorite comic book as a child and to see it come on screen as it has in the past few years has been an absolute fantasic exhilirating experience.
0547258305|5.0|First thought I had about Cashore's work?<br /><br />\\"Why haven't I read these books yet?\\"<br /><br />That thought pretty much stayed with me during the entirety of my reading of Graceling: \\"WHY HAVEN'T I READ THIS YET?\\"<br /><br />In the world of the Seven Kingdoms, Cashore created characters that are layered and complex. Katsa takes the reins of her own life and my respect for her grew by bounds. She doesn't bow to social pressure, but stays true to who she is.<br /><br />There's also a romance that fits and develops over time out of a friendship instead of just jumping into kissing and talks of love. And above all, there's a thrilling adventure that set my pulse to pounding and had me clutching the pages of the book wide-eyed, reading as fast as I could to find out what would happen next.<br /><br />- See more at: [...]

014241493X|4.0|Yayyyy, John Green, yayyyyy! I'm slowly working my way through his fabulous books.<br /><br />In Paper Towns, you've got the characteristic Green wit that makes for some truly laugh out loud funny scenes. As in, don't drink a soda while you're reading this book because it will be coming out of your nose when you snort from sudden laughter and lord that carbonation BURNS YOUR NOSTRILS-<br /><br />-What was I saying?<br /><br />RIGHT, Green's wit. It shines. Particularly in the road trip scene- I think I was actually crying from laughing at one point. It is fabulous and even if I can't ALWAYS picture people actually saying these hilarious things, it makes me want to be these character's best friends.<br /><br />John Green's talent is absolutely astonishing. In Paper Towns, he weaves in literature/poetry absolutely seamlessly. It is essential to the plot and it doesn't feel forced or fake. It just FITS. I think I could sit and read for years, I could be the most well-read person on the planet and still I wouldn't be able to fit poetry or literature in so perfectly or meaningfully to connect with my characters or situations. Green is absolutely brilliant.<br /><br />To further make the point that he's got a crazy amazing brain, Green brings up the idea of being in love with someone versus being in love with the idea of them, and holy brain boggler, Batman, aren't we all guilty of that? From celebrity crushes to how we think a person is. Unless we get to know their true selves, are we in love with them or the idea of them?<br /><br />Overall rating: 4/5. Really wonderful book. Definitely want to add it to my shelves one of these days. If you like the sound of a hilarious, yet serious contemporary novel with a male protagonist, look no further.<br /><br />- See more at: [...]

0770437400|4.0|As many of the other reviewers have pointed out, this book is nothing like the movie but the movie is a lot like the book.  world War Z is not a single story but rather a series of short stories giving accounts from diffrent perspectives of those who expirenced the zombie apocalypse around the world.  The author goes around asking people what their experiences of the recent catyclysm were.  The story is told by men and women both military and civilian that fought to roll back the zombie threat or fought to keep themselves and their loved ones alive.  Th result is a very intresting story that is hard to put down because you want to find out what is going on around the globe. Each account is like a small part of a very large and terrifying puzzle.  Good SciFi presents a problem and then tells how humanity confronts this problem.  World War Z is an excellent exampleof this.  No it is nothing like the movie but the movie is like the book in that the stories of the characters in it would have made some very intresting chapters in the book.  If you have even a passing intrest in zombies this book is must read.

B00571F26Y|2.0|Okay, I'm down with getting rid of wheat, and its every manifestation in our overly-processed diet today. I'm even okay with giving up refined sugar.<br /><br />He cites the overuse of exercise today, because our food is loaded with processed mystery ingredients that adds calories... and that in the 1950s, most people were naturally thin without exercise. You didn't see dozens of people power-walking around the block. And all the exercise June Cleaver got was lifting her vacuum up a flight of stairs.<br /><br />So far, so good.<br /><br />But really - limiting my intake of an apple or orange to a few wedges - or strawberries to two? Forget enjoying a banana, papaya,  or pineapple. And don't you dare eat a potato or have a cob of corn... you'll spike your blood-sugar to the moon. Didn't people in the 1950s eat apples, strawberries, or potatoes?<br /><br />Sure, I'll go along with his thinking that wheat causes inflammation, belly-fat, and provides few positives for our diet. But if you think limiting yourself to 8 blueberries is realistic, you're either diabetic - in which case you have my sincere empathy - or you live in a different universe.<br /><br />One final note: he does emphasize the glycemic index of food, which is crucial, must-have information. And he's good at revealing the extent to which wheat permeates the Western Diet... to our detriment. But I can't reconcile his contradictions, nor can I be that austere with the wide range of natural foods he warns against.
B003M6P2LG|3.0|The characters in this show were portrayed well and were enjoyable to watch.  I liked the different personas.  And the actors who played the dolls did a great job of taking on their roles when they changed.  They really made me believe that another person was in that body. Very believable acting.<br /><br />However, the plot lines were not so believable.  I'm not talking about the sci-fi tech aspect.  I mean a lot of what the characters did just did not make sense and seemed instead to be excuses to bring up interesting scenarios.  But it left me feeling like the show was getting a little silly.<br /><br />-Spoilers below-<br /><br />For example, why did Paul Ballard take such great pains by lying to assist Echo in saving that girl who was in prison, before bringing Echo back?  And why did Echo do it in the first place?  It didn't make sense.  I mean yeah it was great to do that good deed, but I didn't see the point in it concerning the overall plot, or how Echo persuaded Paul to go along with it.<br /><br />And why did Paul join Rossum?  And why did Rossum trust him?  That transition seemed weird and whatever excuses they give did not really give enough reason for this to happen.  He didn't really do anything about stopping the corporation after he was so set on it in the beginning.  And he actually became Echo's handler?  It was just weird.  It felt like they were just trying to give Paul more screen time and try to do interesting things with him around.<br /><br />And why did they send a doll to seduce Paul in the first place?  They could have just gotten rid of him with their thugs the first chance they saw something was going on.  Or go through the government or something.  And why did he decide to infiltrate the Dollhouse single-handedly?  Where was his video camera?  Why did he not just alert someone to the location of the dollhouse that he could trust?  Contact the news?  Didn't he know he was bound to get apprehended and have bad things happen to him once he was caught in a sea of the people who worked there?<br /><br />And on that note, once Paul Ballard joined the Dollhouse, his character became really weak.  He was very motivated and driven in the beginning.  But after joining the Dollhouse, his character no longer made sense.  He just kind of hung around and watched Echo, not really doing anything.  I found their romance not very believable and did not really see what Echo saw in him.<br /><br />Also, why did Topher send Sierra back with that guy with just imprinting her own memories?  What did he expect to accomplish with that?  She was still a lone female with a larger man and it basically could have just ended with the client angry and the girl angry and possibly in danger.  The reasoning behind that just did not make any sense.<br /><br />And Echo kept on talking about this storm coming and getting all the dolls out of there.  Yet she just kept going back on more engagements, not really doing anything about it.  It seemed like she just went back because she was bored and wanted to hang out.  Because that's all she did.  It just didn't make sense what her purpose of going back really was.<br /><br />Also I thought the whole little thing where Alpha cut up the doctor's face because he wanted Echo to be \\"number one\\"  was a little childish.  They mentioned it a few times about being \\"number one\\" and I thought it was sort of non-sensical.  I mean was it really a good thing to be the doll that is used the most in people's fantasies and be taken advantage of?  I suppose he was a psychopath and that was the excuse, but still.<br /><br />Basically, I wish the writers had come up with more believable plot lines.  However, a lot of it was good.  I did enjoy the cast.  I thought that they all were wonderful for their roles.  Also it was neat seeing Summer Glau and Felicia Day.<br /><br />I was also amused by Topher's fantasy imprint on Sierra for his birthday.  (Even though it was a bit disturbing to see him using a dollthis way.)  But there was definitely a geek somewhere behind the writing and I was amused whenever geeky references came up.<br /><br />Overall the premise was interesting, and it was definitely interesting to see what they did with this world where that kind of technology existed.  It does make you wonder if this did exist, would your own stream of consciousness disappear if you went through the procedure?  Though they didn't explicitly mention this in the show.  I really don't think any sort of \\"reprogramming\\" of someone's brain would ever be possible.  But it was still neat to watch.  I also enjoyed the tasteful and sparse interior decor of the Dollhouse.<br /><br />Anyway, overall, I did think this show was entertaining but it wasn't amazingly great.  I didn't see a clear message that was coherent or meaningful.

0073398101|1.0|The book was not as advertised. I ordered hard cover and received paperback. The edition was not correct, the ISBN number was blacked-out and it arrived poorly packed. This put me in a bad position for my class and I will not be returning it. The edition I was sent is an International edition in SI units with different page numbers from the USA edition. This does not track with the assignments given in class. The paperback International edition I was sent usually sells for $20 where I paid $107. Maybe I got a book that some other person returned and didn't get reimbursed for. I learned my lesson, as expensive as it was and would NEVER buy from this seller again. Amazon! Please do something about this. You have several sellers located in India who are making you look bad!!! This is the first time I went outside of Amazon to make a purchase like this.

B009FAQ8IY|5.0|This movie has everything, AND the kitchen sink thrown in; good-guys, bad-guys, morals, action-adventure, religion, romance, hypocrisy, vengeance, and hope. Although, from the time I first viewed it, I wondered what a one-jack was (I don't play any type of card game). The jacks on playing cards is printed in profile, so only one eye is seen, and never the other side of the face (in poker, these are usually set as wild cards). Both Marlon and Karl's character's is just that, wild, portraying themselves as womanizers; tough, lawless, and eventually showing the other side of their face. The acting of all is superb, even minor players, the story A-1, the music, beautiful. Watching it again, it still kept me on the edge of my seat, so to speak. There was one curse word, which was removed, and doesn't detract from the scene. I suppose some may not like the ending, thinking it leaves things up in the air, but it's the way it was done then. It leaves you with hope, that Rio will indeed return, taking his love away to a better life. Rio was the glue, holding the whole movie together, as one watches him transform from a vengeful, escaped prisoner, to a man totally opposite from what he was at the beginning. I believe this could be a family movie, if the parents engage their children in discussion afterwards. Certain men still today go to elaborate lengths, scheming to get a woman in bed. I'm not sure Rio's sudden turn-around happens in real life though. But, the whole point of the movie, was that these one-eyed-jacks, these wild-cards, when they showed the other side of their face, was not only opposite from each other, but one ceased to be wild.

B008ZOHCKE|3.0|I really like this app, so much that I've been thinking about purchasing the paid version, however it's got a few drawbacks that I think would need to be fixed before I bought the paid version. First, let me say that this is the best notebook app I've found minus what it lacks. I think that this app has such huge potential, because it's easy &amp; convenient. I have like ten notebook apps on my Kindle &amp; so far this one is my favorite, except for what it lacks. On to what it lacks. I think that they should put several main notebooks (like a &quot;binder&quot;) so that you can organize your notes better. Either that, or as some people mentioned, add it so you can put tabs in your notebooks. Also, on top of that, I think that they should change the password to lock single notebooks instead of all of them, but the thing I think is most important to fix is that you can't rearrange the pages/add new pages in between or before existing pages. Once those are fixed, I think it'll be the best journal app on the amazon app store.

B005XQLBU4|4.0|Missile Defender starts off easy, but quickly ramps up the difficulty and will have you furiously tapping the screen within minutes. Pulling off combo shots involves a bit of strategy, but overall this game is a pretty simplistic way to kill some time.

B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Have read a couple books like this lately, and this is I thought the best one.  Harold is a kind man, doing the best he can.  I hoped for his success all the way along.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this app.  Finally a game that works your brain.  You have to actually think and solve puzzle.  Some math, some common sense, some plain old luck. I love playing this alone or with my kids.
B009AMAGQM|1.0|What a bummer.<br /><br />Not even close to the book, and the book COULD have been a great movie. Unfortunately the crap-bag writers decided to slap together an adaptation that would be in league with the Twilight series. This of course seriously brings down a quality story.<br /><br />I can not believe that the authors of Beautiful Creatures signed off on yet another poisonous rape of a perfectly good book. Some of the reviewers complained about the poor acting in this movie, but honestly who out there would feel like putting there best show on when handed such an abysmal script?
0887431453|5.0|i had a bad experience with my purchase, but the book itself was fantastic! LOTS of stuff for the kids to work on. REALLY recommend the book!

B001I82RVS|4.0|I had to wait a while after seeing Tokyo Gore Police before writing a review.  My mind needed time to digest what I had seen.  So here we go:<br /><br />Tokyo Gore Police is an over-the-top splatterfest punctuated by hilariously-inappropriate advertisements whose main story takes the deliciously-surreal elements of Videodrome to a decidedly Japanese extreme.  While very graphic in its depiction of gore, Tokyo Gore Police takes it so far to the next level that its more fascinating than shocking, like a caricature of gore more than anything else.  There are some sexual situations and implied sex but no outright nudity.<br /><br />The pacing of the movie is good, with the aforementioned advertisements (along with periodic \\"news bites\\" from what looks like a latex-clad police dispatcher) moving things along.  The action and gore are both way over-the-top, and the acting is decent.  The main character Ruka (played by gorgeous model/actress Eihi Shiina) shows almost no emotion throughout the film but still manages to portray a troubled tough-as-nails (yet still vulnerable) elite police officer.<br /><br />Comparisons of Tokyo Gore Police to Machine Girl are easy to make but superficial.  While there are similarities between the two, there are far more differences in style and substance, with Tokyo Gore Police being a much more mature (and potentially disturbing) film.  Both are good movies but for different reasons.<br /><br />I give Tokyo Gore Police a solid 4 out of 5 stars.  Entertaining, engrossing, outrageous, gory fun - not - for the whole family.
B00AECGQF2|3.0|Just a simple little fun thing , haven't really played with it much yet so may be more to it than I have discovered.

B000IDEORY|5.0|I have always loved this movie and happy to have it on DVD.  I watch it over and over again.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I honestly can't believe I loved a book so heavily involved with football...I hate football? I found this story really gentle and delicate and actually very romantic in a very quirky way, but quirky and delicate is something Matthew Quick does exceptionally well and so I'm not really all that surprised. The story is actually kinda simple and the truth is sad, but this book is not. I laughed, I cried and upon completion I sat with it feeling oddly hopeful with a slow sweet melody of &#34;fly eagles fly&#34; in my head. READ THIS BOOK!
B0050CJNJ2|1.0|Perfect playing, perfect singing, perfect arrangements, perfect packaging, perfect image, perfect promotion.<br /><br />Lady Antebellum's music is perfect.<br /><br />It just isn't any good.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|I read this book and absolutely LOVED it. The movie...well I'm conflicted. While I think the movie was good and the performances good as well, and I do understand the accolades that followed. However, I guess what is hard for me to digest is that the book felt really gentle and romantic and quirky where as this film is just CRACKLING with angry man energy that just wasn't there in the book. Now I understand cinematic metaphor and specifically the irony with this adaptation, in that it's a book about a guy who thinks his life is a Hollywood movie, but as it turns out life isn't a Hollywood movie, yet this is a Hollywood movie...my head is spinning. For me the movie did not stay true to the spirit of the written work and for that it fell a little flat for me.
B008X9Z37A|3.0|This case is reasonably sturdy and is covered with a woven synthetic fabric, which makes it easy to grip.  Since I will be carrying my Kindle in a pocket in my briefcase most of the time, what I needed was something to protect the Kindle Fire HD from scratches and other FOD.  This works okay.<br /><br />It has two minor shortcomings:  (1) The elastic strap in the upper left corner covers the speaker jack, and it's a nuisance having to pull it aside to plug earphones in.  (2) It really would have been good to have a place to hold the capacitive stylus.<br /><br />At $19.99 it's a bit overpriced, but not as badly as most of the covers I've seen.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This well written &#34;love story&#34; filled in an area I was totally ignorant about. Thanks goes to the author for that. Despair, hope, excitement, mystery, psychology, relationship... this was a hard-to-put-down book. I will search out her other books pronto.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I really expected to love this book.  I was so wrong.  It was written poorly, went on too long, and had a somewhat annoying ending.  I cannot possibly understand how this book has remained on the best-seller list for so long.
B001RCD2DW|3.0|I don't know if the headphones are any good or not.  The shipment arrived a day late and I opened the package immediately, anxious to start the burn-in process.  But wait.  The first thing that caught my eye was the absence of the notation \\"Made in Austria\\", so prominently embossed on the earpieces of the K702 and other similar AKG product photos shown on Amazon.  Instead, hidden on the underside of the headband, was a small sticker with the words \\"Made in China (P.R.C.)\\".  It is naive to assume that products produced in Austria are in all cases superior to those made in China.  However, I am generally comforted to know that a product was produced in a factory with a history and tradition of producing that product, and I am similarly leery of products made in a contract shop halfway round the world from the brand marketer; assembled unlovingly by workers who know their jobs could be exported to a lower-cost producer in a heartbeat. I know that the high-end of the AKG line is budget stuff compared to headphones that you can easily plump $10,000 for, but that is not the point.  I thought that anything made in a EU country for under $300 was worth a shot. The AKG K702 cans may be the greatest thing since sliced bread, but I bought them based on assumptions that turned out not to be true and I can't avoid the feeling that I've been played.  I brought the discrepancy to the attention of Amazon and expressed my displeasure.  Their response, when it arrives, will likely point out to me that in making my purchase I accepted their Terms of Use which doubtless allow changes in product specs, characteristics, and country of origin without notice.<br />Just like Chinese food, such an explanation will leave me feeling less than satisfied.

B0029LCJJS|5.0|This series was very entertaining and even on my Kindle it was magnificently staged.  That being said, I would not recommend this if you prefer the historical &#34;truth&#34; of things.  The series, by the admission of the director, has changed events to make them more theatrical.  As a consequence, you are NOT getting the actual historical truth of these times.  But for entertainment, it's great.  For education, it's not great.  You just have to keep that in mind and be prepared to overlook the fact that this is not historically accurate.  Great for all ages and totally fascinating look at a very interesting time in English history.

Also from what I read once you download an app for amazon fire you cannot get a refund.

B00EBBQXZ0|5.0|The fact that Scarface is a film that is firmly in my own top ten movies of all time, along with Godfather 2 and Shawshank Redemption, instantly drew me to this work.<br />You may consider that a book containing this level of detail surrounding plot, characterisation and the relationships between Pacino, De-Palma, Lumet and other creative greats, together with comparisons to Shakespearian works and the original 1932 film, may make this a heavy read.<br />Not so.<br />Stevenson's prose and intellect shine through and encourage the reader to keep turning pages into the early hours.<br />Everything is here for the movie fan. This is the best, 'read between the lines' investigation of a cinematic creation I have read to date. Stevenson is to be commended.
B001HC8516|3.0|I have mixed feelings about this book. It portrays the darker side of people in general. While being somewhat disheartening to read, it also served as a reality check, in a way. I don't know if everyone considering this book needs or desires this kind of reality check, but I leave the choice up to you.
B00ENTDDGW|4.0|It's good for playing air hockey, but gets boring fast.  But I really like the neon affects though, it makes it look good
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|This concept has potential to be an amazing movie. They have tremendous actors that are wonderful. It is a movie that you could watch over to to pick up all the story lines going on. Picking up everything in the first viewing isn't realistic. However, 3 hours long? Really? For me the movie didn't hit the mark. I get the concept and its not worth 3 hours of my time to watch it again.
B005HI4LMS|5.0|I ran across this movie on netflix. I was in the mood for a horror movie and picked it. It was a crazy type movie full of not quite the \\"Scary Movie\\" vibe, but more of a comedy mystery horror. It was entertaining and had a crazy plot twist at the end. If you are in the mood for bloody horro with a little bit of comedy, then get it.
B005HF2NHQ|5.0|I was a fan of this show when it first came out in 2005, I just recently started to watch the entire series again in 2013. I forgot what a great show it was. It's family friendly, but definitely for an adult audience. Being able to watch the series in it's entirety is wonderful, you get to see the family grow and change as the series progresses. I think the show is very well cast and acted. It has humor, love, mystery and spooky twists but it's not cliche in any way. Then and now, I felt the show was very original and a pleasure to watch. I would highly recommend this series for mystery fans and supernatural fans alike. But if your looking for dark and gory, this is not the show for you. It's a more uplifting show and the focus is not on violence, but on justice and family.<br /><br />While I'm very skeptical about physic powers I'm not totally closed to the idea, There are many unexplained phenomena now and throughout human history, some we have studied and now have logical explanations for and others that still remain a mystery. Who knows, one day we might learn things about the human brain in the future that will explain what we now call physic phenomenon. We all have instincts, and most people have had unexplained dreams, feelings that turned out to be true. Just because we can't explain something, doesn't mean it's not real. Of course when it comes to mediums or psychics, there are many fakes floating around out there taking advantage of people desperate to connect with loved ones who have passed, and it's really a shame, as it takes away most credibility for those rare people who do have some kind of gift. The idea of psychic powers has always fascinated me. Allison DuBois is an actual person who is a medium and she did work for the Arizona DA's office. The show \\"Medium\\" is based on her life and experiences.

B001VZY4M8|5.0|While my favorite Neil is &#34;Everybody knows this is Nowhere&#34;, this album I think was/is his best. He really starts to get into using his falsetto and while not my favorite, the songs on this are fantastic
B009GIPDQS|5.0|John Grisham and Dick/Felix Francis my two favorite authors for holiday reading - but be warned I don't want to be interrupted.  Very creative ideas and probably a must for all law makers and law enforcement personnel, this way they will help close the loop holes that always exist in any system.
0142420891|5.0|Gayle Forman has become my new favorite author. This book was beautifully written, as are all her books, and was the perfect follow-up to If I Stay. What a fantastic emotional roller coaster ride this was. But then again, ALL her books seem to be fabulous emotional roller coaster rides. I can't wait for more.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|For a mental health discussion, the interview gave some small insights but these were narrow in relation to the whole film. I liked learning about the actors' interactions and dynamics in the actual filming- especially domestic situations where sons with mental-emotional struggles were spoken of.
B001D0DQUC|1.0|Ferris Bueller manipulates everyone around him to gain his own pleasure and enjoyment and manipulates his best friend and sister to take the blame when things go wrong. I could not suspend my belief that people are smarter than that. Whoever wrote and produced this movie must really think that people are stupid. I'm suprised that this was classified as a comedy. It wasn't very funny at all.
B003F5NSTW|5.0|The style in which this book is written is innovative. I imagine for a writer this style makes the storyline difficult to maintain. Lionel shriver to her credit, engages the reader throughout the book.
0316228532|4.0|Good read. She tells a story really so well. This being said, the story  did not go anywhere and it seemed to be just a 500 page book that could have been written as a kick ass 150 page one.  I love this author so it is hard to not like anything that she writes and of course I will buy her new one.  Instead of buying it, borrow from a friend is the way to go or library it for sure.
B006A9JFGU|5.0|This is one of the best Rolling Stones CDs.  Big hits like Miss You and Beast of Burden are here as well as Shattered and When the Whip Comes Down.  I love every song on this CD and I remember well the excitement this \\"album\\" created when it was released in 1978!  I was only 15 years old at the time and my sister and I made a special trip to a record store to get a copy!  This album is also provocative for it's amazing cover artwork!  This would be considered an iconic Rolling Stones album.  I highly recommend this album for any music collection!  I also recommend  [[ASIN:B001WCN23W Sticky Fingers]]  another album with a provocative cover and  [[ASIN:B0039TD826 Exile on Main Street]].
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|Such a sad story. Superb acting. Makes you think about twice about going to the coast.  Not for young kids if you ever want them to go to the beach again.
0670026603|5.0|Although it seems like a typical boy meets girl story it raises a lot of questions about quality of life and the right to choose when to end it. It's not all tied up in a neat little bow. It's a big issue wrapped around characters who are well developed and interesting.

B00DPY95D6|5.0|This book has an incredibly unique plot.<br /><br />Cheryl is just doing a run of the mill bankruptcy when things start to go wrong. Soon you are left wondering if the strange events are in fact happening or if they are a figment of Cheryl's imagination.<br /><br />What begins as a normal courtroom drama soon turns into an engaging thriller. Once you start it will hook you until the last page. I'm really hoping that a sequel is in the works!

0142001104|5.0|I will re-read this book about once a year. I never tire of it. It is inspiring and interesting, written well and with a great message.

B00ECR7KX2|5.0|I'm a big time Joss Wheadon fan and this is no exception. Wheadon did a great job adapting the classic Shakespeare story with an excellent cast. And seriously, filming it in 12 days? Joss Wheadon is a beast.<br /><br />If you like Shakespeare, you'll love this adaption.

B000AM2L1O|5.0|I bought this precious doll for a 1-year old's first birthday gift.  Her baby brother was due to arrive in two weeks, and I guessed correctly that she would like to mimic her mother talking care of her new baby brother.<br /><br />The doll was recommended was a slightly older child, but could not have been more perfect for this adorable 12-month old little toddler.<br /><br />There was a rather large contingency of well-heeled adults on hand for this couple's birthday party for their first child.  The gifts were many and lavish, but the child immediately fell in love with her first baby doll, and refused to be distracted by her other gifts.<br /><br />This sweet-faced baby doll was the perfect size for her, and she loves it!<br /><br />I don't recall seeing it mentioned, but the eyes open and close.  Two tiny teeth can be barely seen.

B002ZHKZEC|4.0|What more can I say about the 10th Doctor's Specials that hasn't already been said.  They're great.  The problem I have and this has been a major problem with all of my Doctor Who Blu-ray sets (and I own every Blu-ray for modern Doctor Who available) is that the audio tracks are really screwed up when played through my Onkyo receiver.<br /><br />It's obviously a codec issue but what happens is that the DTS HD HR (not tobe confused with the lossless MA) audio randomly drops in and out on and either completely disappears or you can only hear certain channels.  Although I had the random dropout issues on my other DW sets, the solution to that was to simply to change the audio output on the PS3 from bitsream to linear PCM. This results in no change in audio quality with the only difference really being that the display on the receiver shows &#34;Multichannel&#34; instead of &#34;DTS HD HR.&#34;<br /><br />With this set, however, that doesn't work and the discs become impossible to enjoy.  I have done all of my updates and I have tried connecting different Blu-ray players to the receiver with no change and I must not that out of the 400 Blu-ray titles I own, the DW titles are the only ones I've ever had a problem with.

Are there more people in the Eye?  What was the payoff, not only for the plot, but where was the payoff for the viewer?  All we got was some lame half-cocked explanation... Poor form, bad writing. bad movie.
B009APMNB0|4.0|I used this to color balance two monitors connected to the same computer.  In the end the colors on each monitor are indeed more accurate, but the colors displayed on the two are visually somewhat different still.  I would expect both to display the colors precisely the same if they were truly correctly color balanced.  The difference is not a problem in my case -- the net result is acceptable for my purposes.  Also I had a bit of a problem when I did a second color balance on the same monitor.  Evidently the software does not detect that there is already a profile for a monitor so it color balances the monitor using the original profile, which it replaces with the new profile.  Needless to say the colors are then entirely incorrect.  I had to figure out how to manually remove an existing profile.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|I had this game on my phone and switched to kindle made it much easier to complete the different levels.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book is a fantastical escape. Absolutely enchanting is the only way I can think to describe it! The characters are only subtly less inspired then the fantastic colors and lack of color they are presented in. Thank you!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|My son downloaded this game for him yet I find myself playing it as well. Super fun game to play
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This is one of the awesomeness games I've ever played! It's addicting, fun, frightening, and is super hyper-realistic. Totally five stars, best game ever-kindle fire, BOOM! Buy it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It's just incredible the scenes Collins can describe!<br />I wasn't a fan of the movies because I never read the books. Now that I have, I want to rewatch the movie.<br />The story is a stretch, but it's just so creative and deep.<br /><br />I was thoroughly drawn in, and entertained.
B00E0MCYPS|4.0|This game is pretty good it has good graphics and cool tracks. I just wish they had a better selection of cars you can pick from.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|This is the first Paramore album I've ever bought, so I can't compare it much to old ones. I really enjoy this album. The first time I listened to it, I was only into about half the songs. A couple stood out to me right away, but that was all. After listening to the whole thing for the second time, I enjoyed every single song on the album. I feel like this album is going to grow on me even more, each time I listen to it. Their lead single &#34;Into You&#34; is the most pop-sounding this album gets. The rest of the songs on the album are much more rock which is great.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I think anyone could figure out what was going on.  And what the secret was.<br />It was a bit crazy and I didn't enjoy the writing at all.<br />Ended quickly and wasn't satisfied with the ending.  Was not an enjoyable book at all.  I felt I wasted my time reading it.
B005FLX2WC|4.0|If you are a blues fan and enjoy female blues singers then Beth Hart belts it out on this album. I wish there was more Bonamassa on this but it is a good album.
B004GTKP3S|4.0|Nice to have the saga continue.  Drama and humor both.  Nicely acted and empathetic characters.  Interesting insight into the history of the time.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|Fasten your belt, this movie had me rolling around. It has to be one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. This is the original and is not to be confused by the US imitation with Chris Rock made after this one was released.
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|Found the music to be out of place and kind of jarring.  Enjoyed DiCaprio's performance as a tycoon; his facial expressions subtly conveyed the nuances of a man of great wealth.  The storyline was somewhat disturbing because it showcased the weaknesses of human nature and sadly ended as a downer.
B0082SU98U|5.0|I love all of Porter's books., remind me of my youth.  could not put the book down till last page.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Such a great book· I can't wait to read it again, I would recommend perks of being a wallflower to anyone
0596805888|5.0|Insightful, funny, and very educational. Many cook books are not worth the price since you can find so many great recipes online for free. But this book is super instructive and has great recipes. Totally worth getting!
B00ARX2W24|5.0|I have always loved Herb Alpert when he had the Tijuana Brass group and sound but he really went in a new direction with this one.  Some of the old Herb Alpert is there but there is also a melodic sound he has put in.  It is one of my favorites and every song is top notch.  Buy it and I guarantee you will love it.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book really kept me guessing and wondering what I would do if faced with this dilemma. I even asked my friends what they would do. Enjoyed a lot!
B00E0MCYPS|2.0|great looking game.  controls stink.  I used my ultimate way to review.  I had my son play.  he bated the controls and deleted it before I could!
B0049985XW|5.0|One of the Greatest Films of the 1940s --- with John Huston directing his own father Walter in an unforgettable film, unforgettable characters and unforgettable performances that still affect modern culture almost 7 decades later.
B006RXQ800|5.0|Excellent movie!! Everyone should watch this to learn about our American history. It's not correct in the fact that the extent of the slums weren't seen until the late 19th century during the Gilded age.
B004OR1X6A|5.0|One must thank all the powers that be for resurrecting this great album and moment in time from the ashes it may have otherwise become ... you either &#34;get it, or you don't&#34; ... Rory was a rough diamond and that is my preferred jewel.
B004YCKJSS|5.0|What makes \\"Beautiful Girls\\" great?<br /><br />First, its cast is top-notch. In almost all instances, the actors (Natalie Portman, Matt Dillon, Uma Thurman, etc.) have gone on to have stellar careers. Their collective talents are already evident in realistic, compelling portrayals of their characters.<br /><br />Second, the portrayals of the key male characters are, sad to say, all too realistic, featuring a half dozen men closing in on thirty who are still somehow lost, both in their relationship with their wife or girlfriend, and also in their ability to graduate from youth into the responsibilities of a mature and stable adulthood. (As a male who took a long, long time to \\"find\\" myself as an adult, I could certainly relate to this.) Each of the individual stories is truly believable.<br /><br />Third, there is the also all too real male sense that one's partner (long-term girlfriend or wife) is perhaps not quite the right person, that there's someone better \\"out there\\" who is cuter, will offer more excitement, and is one's true soulmate.<br /><br />Finally, \\"Beautiful Girls\\" features a truly charming relationship between Willie (Timothy Hutton) and 13-year-old Marty (Natalie Portman), in which Willie is drawn to a girl less than half his age because of her vivacious character and their common intellectual passions, one that we know from the start is not going to work but which amply illustrates that attraction far transcends the sexual or the realistic.<br /><br />There's very little to criticize in this movie, other than that the introduction of the characters is sufficiently abrupt and disjointed that it takes a bit of time to sort out the various relationships.
B001EXE2ZG|5.0|A defining moment in Hollywood films, and one of the greatest character studies on film.  Wilder and Swanson's masterpiece of decadence and ambition ... delusion and death.  Brilliant in every way.
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|This is my first tracking device ever. The reason I got one is that I felt that tracking my daily activity would force me to go out and move more. I now walk instead of taking the bus, always take the stairs instead of elevators etc...I check my steps several times a day and go for walks to meet the 10,000 daily steps WHO recommendation. I've only used the device for a couple of weeks so my opinion of it my change overtime and will update this review accordingly.<br /><br />This is my opinion on this device<br /><br />Good<br />- Track your steps (pretty accurately)<br />- It detects when you run (and how long) vs when you walk (this is huge!).<br />- Track your elevation in feet (somewhat accurately)<br />- Track your pulse (as accurate as those smartphone apps that use your phone camera)<br />- It silently syncs with your phone via bluetooth every 4 hours or so and you can force an update by pressing on the power button for 3 seconds.<br />- Good battery life. I am usually at 40% after a week of use.<br />- The Withings app integrates well with most apps and devices out there (even competing devices). It definitely needs some refinements and has got some bugs but it's got great ideas baked in. You can glance at a nice graph of your overall health at any time.<br /><br />Bad:<br />- You can't (yet?) configure the recommended 10,000 steps and the 8 hours of sleep.<br />- Sleep tracking is inaccurate and shuts off for no reason sometimes. I woke up a couple times realizing that the device had stopped tracking 1h30 minutes into my sleep. The most accurate measure is how long you sleep. However, it's a manual step: You need to set it to sleep mode before you put it in the wristband and then turn it off when you wake up. I believe no company has got sleep tracking right yet. The only one that did (Zeo) went belly up :-/<br />- The touchscreen is a nice feature but is not very responsive.<br />- It takes a lot of babysitting and if you're a distracted person it might not be right for you. You need to move the device from the belt-clip (or pocket) to the wristband and vice-versa. You can always put it in your pocket instead of the clip but I would not recommend it because it's easy to do laundry and forget that the device was there.<br /><br />This device needs some refinements but is close to be the perfect tracking device in my opinion. I really like the fact that Withings is a bit open about data is interacts with a lot of apps and devices out there.be right for you.

B00BTFJZYM|5.0|The video was happy and sad, and just right for me. The video is on my top self and now is my favorite video.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|This was a good book although kinda long.  But most of Ken Follett's books are long.  He developed the characters so that you wanted to keep reading and see what happens next.  Very enjoyable read.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Its fun but wen u start to get to the higher levels it  gets way harder like easter egg it takes a ling time ti figure thet one out

B0082XJGRK|4.0|He was known as<br />Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, born at Rome A.D. 121, 26th April became Emperor of Rome.<br />A philosophical man who believed in the immortality of the soul. One should look for the<br />book authored by George Long; Thoughts of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus.

B00E7SID9G|5.0|Hard as it is to believe, the life and times of Jesus is a part of history that most christians know little about. That has created many opportunities for misconceptions and fallacies to become accepted as fact and the truth. It has also allowed the curch over the ages to actively promote an artificial version of this history.<br /><br />Whether you read this book purely for the historical perspective or whether you are a christian who wants to discover the roots of your faith and enhance your knowledge of Christ, this book is a must read.  It is highly readable, keeps you riveted through the interesting historical facts and perspectives and goes a long way to place large parts of the new testament in a proper historical context - which in turn is critical for the correct interpretation and understanding of those parts of the bible.
B00ECU4DPW|5.0|My 4YO daughter and I loved it. We especially loved seeing Spike as a dog. An absolute must-see for bronies and pegasisters!!!
B005CMSDKA|5.0|Sound and picture quality of this film is like being at the movie theatre.  Good action film with this up and coming actress.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved it.  I am not one to spoil a book for someone else but all I can see is read this book and fall in love like I did
B0024F08RO|5.0|Surprisingly, most stores don't have this season.  They have everything else, but not the final season.  That makes a lot of sense.  It's a good show coming to an end.  It's not a bad ending, so it doesn't disappoint.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book.... After reading book one and two I read book 3 in one day I loved this story and I loved they way it ended
B006BQNJR8|3.0|The movie was full of gore and for that I gave it 3 stars. The storyline failed to deliver and was extremely unrealistic even for the world of fantasy film.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My sister in law asked me to read this book she told me I would never put it down...... 2 days later and I was back at amazon looking for book 2
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Well written.  Very imaginative and colorful.  You have to suspend reality in order to follow the book, just like being in the circus
B008469DGY|5.0|Very nice graphics, simple, intuitive game play. Great game for when you have a few minutes to kill. One of the better free apps of the day, and worth a buck if you missed it.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|It's Taylor Swift!<br />How can it be anything but awesome??<br />Great edgy tunes on this CD, riding the fence between<br />Country and pop.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|For 35 bucks its pretty cool.  I have a Netflix on my DVD player and navigating is bearable.  Navigation with my Nexus 10 and the Chromecast is easier, but I would like to be able to display more things.  I would like to display powerpoint presentation or spreadsheets for work but AFAIK this does not.  The power cord is a bit of a drag.  It would be nice if power over HDMI was in the works.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so awesome my mom got this for me and inn in love with all the versions because of this one thank you mojang
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Often stretches credibility but quite readable. I did read to the end but am not prompted to read any more of the same story.
B005OT2YVA|4.0|I did watch transformers when I was a kid. But I don't really remember so much details. When the movie came out, I fell in love with these autobots again. I know the storyline or something else doesn't make it a good one. But I love the fighting, love the noise during they transfer. went to the theater watching all the series, never getting tired of it !! They are my man my hero!! love them!
B00BW6SOIQ|1.0|Watched the entire movie, ( felt like 2 days). He was much better in Sex Lies and Video Tape. Don't waste your time with this one.
0375869026|5.0|This book is a really good and fast read!  I enjoyed the plot and the dynamics between the relationships throughout the book.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I'm not a sci-fi lover, although I have enjoyed my share of Star Wars movies and Star Trek as well.  But those were not books, so i wonder if I qualify to review this book.  That being said, i loved the quick start of the first paragraph. I immediately was pulled in and wanted to know what was happening to this little six year old boy.  I was not prepared for the pain that he would be put through emotionally.  Wow, it bothered me but also made sense because of the survival instinct that we all have.  Everyone wants to win, sometimes that means a fight for survival.  You see it in the life of this little boy and in the human race.<br /><br />I was fascinated by the future Earth and the rules, inhabiting other planets, and the strategic battles of the mind and in preparation for a war.<br /><br />I would have given it five stars but it was so sad that i had a hard time getting to the end.  How much can a child genious endure?  Perhaps it should have been called &#34;Endurers Game&#34;
1565234243|5.0|I am a novice carver and have found this book to be very helpful with my carving projects.  Lots of good information, and helpful tips.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|She loves this game! It progresses a bit slow but has kept her attention and the unicorns are pretty cool!
B00B3EJ0OY|5.0|This is Love. My wife and I watched this on our 10th anniversary and it reminds me of how in love we truly are. After 10 years and 5 children, life is beautiful. How fortunate we are to have each other.
B00AFEXRME|4.0|But then again Denzel Washington is a great actor anyway. The other actors held their own too. Story line was really awesome. I don't think too many people didn't like the movie.
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|I love it. It shows that meaning can give us great strength and we could overcome all our small or big issues
B009AMANBA|5.0|The acting of all characters were great. Story line was great. Attire of actors were very believable to a fault. I would definatley give this movie a thumbs up & tell friends & family to watch it. If they haven't already watched it.
B00634GHJA|2.0|After several tries I gave up. It wouldn't work on my aneroid tablet and was more trouble than<br />Google drive.
B009NY3CL8|5.0|Priceless. I feel like anything is possible in movies like these. Reminds of bring a kid. Hook is hilarious! Wonderful.
B00D6B4PUG|5.0|Makes checking email quickly a breeze - always seems to get the categories right, too.  I focus on Updates, then Primary.  The rest is for when I have more time.
0553384775|5.0|I guarantee you will not be able to put this book down, an absolute page turner. Scorsese and Di Caprio wouldn't work on the project if this weren't true. I enjoyed it immensely.
B004S3MB2U|1.0|unfortunately, if you aren't signed in to the Amazon appstore, you can't use it. I don't always have an internet connection, so I can't rely on this. Amazon should point out when/if the apps they give away are crippled!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved this game. It really makes you think. Sorry to see it end.  I hope they up date it with new levels. This game was a lot better than 100 Floors.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Great Movie!  I didn't think I would like Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher but he actually did a great job.
B0056C6XIA|5.0|compact like a Letherman, and it works the same but I think the original Gerber is more sturdy for torque but what I really like about this multitool is it came with the flashlight and flint, and unlike most multitools the blades lock in place, very useful.
B003MC5N28|3.0|The book held me in its grasp for the entirety, until the last chapter. The ending seemed very contrived and I am not sure I understand just why it ended where it did.
B00AO686MY|2.0|This disc says it is re-mastered, but it is very grainy. This is very disappointing. It basically looks like a normal DVD. AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL! That being said, it is better than the VHS version that I used to have and it is still Roger Rabbit.
B009NY43NY|5.0|The last book in the series, I wanted to read it and I didn't want to finish it. It was hard for me to let these characters go. Harris does not disappoint!!
B005XUC398|4.0|I LOVED THE MOVIE BUT I THINK THE WAY IT ENDED WAS A LITTLE LAM.IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN LONGER ,AND THE PLOT SHOULD HAVE BEEN STRONGER.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Feedly acts like Google reader except better.  I love it.  Saved items are separated for later review not continually in the to read now stuff.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I avoided reading this book for a while because the reviews weren't really flattering regardless of the popularity of the book. I decided to give it a shot and frankly I could take it or leave it. The story wasn't some amazing, awe inspiring discovery that makes me want to read it again...however, it's also not a horrific, super juvenile, failed attempt of a story that should be burned.<br />I'll start by saying that I liked Christian and Anastasia together. There relationship seemed really natural and their chemistry was obvious.<br />There isn't much to be said about Christian, other than he is undeniably sexy and fifty shades of f****d up. I think I know what his issues are but this first book doesn't give much away. He's moody and controlling, yet playful.<br />Anastasia seemed really goofy and child-like, almost nerdy with an edge. I liked her, but the authors inner dialogue for her killed me. \\"Oh jeez\\" \\"holy crap\\" or her reference to her butt \\"my behind?\\" \\"my backside?\\" You just had your boyfriends penis in your mouth, but you can't say ass? Give me a break. She just seemed like a teenager sometimes, but I'll just chalk that up to her inexperience and naivete.<br />The basic plot of the story is easing Anastasia into Christians life of BDSM and considering this is a trilogy I don't think it was necessary for this first book to be so long! Don't get me wrong, the sex was hot (nothing major though), the banter was cute and funny but I can think of several chapters that shouldn't have been written.<br />All of that being said, I didn't love the book, but I did like it. I intend to finish the rest of the books and I recommend so far HOWEVER there is no reason for this damn book to cost as much as it does. Just saying.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Very nice game.  Much better than expected.  Exceptional graphics, original look, perfect on the Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;.  I got it for free and it is really too good to be free but I'm not complaining.
B003QSJVV2|5.0|Excellent movie if you are looking for a action packed movie. Would highly recommend this movie, especially for any car fans.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Me (46 y/o) and my nephew (8 y/o) both enjoyed this app! It's hard to be any Angry Birds game!!

B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I'm 46 and enjoyed playing this game so much.  Don't get to play a lot but enjoy the excitement of the race, crashing, etc.  My 8 year old nephew enjoys it as well-
B009AMAJVO|4.0|The two leads are truly mesmerizing, This story could have been better written with the elements it was exploring, still it was a very good write, worth watching multiple times, which I have done.
