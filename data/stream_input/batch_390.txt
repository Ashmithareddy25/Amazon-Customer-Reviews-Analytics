B00000K0E5|5.0|&quot;Goldeneye&quot; is the seventeenth overall James Bond film and Pierce Brosnan's first, highly celebrated, performance in this role that he is so seemingly suited for.  While I thought Timothy Dalton did a great job with the two films he was able to perform in, Pierce Brosnan just that much more emulates the qualities desired of a James Bond.  It was interesting during the time leading up to this great Bond film, hearing all about the negotiations and such for Pierce Brosnan to take the mantle as, if I remember correctly, the powers that be when it comes to the James Bond series, were waiting for Pierce Brosnan to age properly before handing that mantle over to him.<br />In this, his first and strangely enough, his best performance as the British super agent, Pierce Brosnan takes the role and readily makes it his own in an exemplary manner.  It will most certainly be interesting to see, in the final analysis, how many Bond movies he does get to do before the series producers start looking in another direction.  I don't believe I've seen any actors out there as of yet that could come close to filling his or any of the other great Bond actor's shoes.  Credit also goes to Sean Bean for his performance as one of the villains in this great film.  Up until his incredible performance in &quot;The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; as Boromir, he had been pretty much been typecast as the villain in most films as he does perform them so well.<br />As with all great Bond films, there are the Bond babes and the extraordinarily beautiful women that get to take those roles.  &quot;Goldeneye&quot; has the great fortune to have Famke Janssen as an outstanding villainess.  She is best known of late in her role in the &quot;X-Men&quot; movies or for Star Trek fans, her most memorable role as Kamala in one of Star Trek The Next Generation's best and most emotionally touching episodes.  Starring in the love interest role is the ever gorgeous Russian beauty, Isabella Scorupco whose performance in the great Bond film is extraordinarily memorable.  Unfortunately for her, it seems to have typecast her and although her career since this film hasn't flopped, it didn't quite do for her what I'm sure she was hoping for.<br />Making her first appearance as M in this film is Judi Dench, who after watching this film and the following three has proven to be a great decision in getting that pivotal role.  She plays a perfect M in countering many of Bond's quips.  Also of interest is Joe Don Baker's appearance in this film and &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; as a somewhat eccentric CIA agent is played perfectly.<br />Director Martin Campbell who may best be known for &quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot; does an absolutely wonderful job with &quot;Goldeneye,&quot; bringing out the exceptional script perfectly and displaying exceptionally well the balance between action sequences and drama.<br />The score for the film is as perfect as they normally are for all Bond films.  Its great seeing and hearing the famous Bond tune in conjunction with Pierce Brosnan who is now forever indelibly linked with that particular tune.<br />The Premise:<br />One of the most important elements in a Bond film is the pre main title action packed opening sequence, which for most Bond films fall into one of three categories; doesn't quite work out, works fairly well or works spectacularly.  &quot;Goldeneye's&quot; version of the pre main title opening sequence works spectacularly, to say the least.  I would definitely have to say that it is one of the most exciting ones out of the series of twenty films to date.<br />This incredible Bond film, like most of them, takes us all over the globe as James Bond finds himself on the trail of Russian's who have taken over the controls to a secret Russian satellite which has the capability of destroying London or any other major city on the planet.  Along the way to saving the planet or at the very least the Crown, Mr. Bond takes the time to enjoy the &quot;scenery&quot; in the best way he knows how...<br />Simply put, &quot;Goldeneye&quot; is an incredible Bond film, starring one of the best Bonds yet in Pierce Brosnan.  I highly recommend this film to any and all who are fans of the Bond series or at the least, fans of great action packed movies that are extremely well written and performed as well.  {ssintrepid}<br />Special Features:<br />As this was the first Bond film starring Pierce Brosnan, MGM went out of their way to pack it with some great Special Features, all of which are highly informative and entertaining to watch.<br />-A newly created widescreen master for optimal picture and sound quality<BR>-Audio commentary featuring Director Martin Campbell and Producer Michael G.

B0000DD7LB|5.0|I am a big music fan that usually stays away from mainstream pop radio, however, I have (secretly) liked a few of Britney's songs in the past. The first time I heard \\"Toxic\\" I loved it.  It sounds like it could fit on Beck's \\"midnite vultures\\" album.  The bottom line is that Britney works with some awesome producers. These guys know what they are doing in the studio.  I decided to take a chance and actually buy the album and I don't regret it.  It's just a great CD that is fun for blasting in your car or whatever.  Britney is always bound to get mixed reviews, that is part of being a huge pop star.  I think she pulls it off well with this very sexy, more mature album. Buy this CD...it's good. <BR>The hottest track in this disc?  \\"SHOWDOWN\\"
B0000028M7|4.0|Alice In Chains - Dirt (1992)<br /><br />These ruminations on drug addiction are so depressing, chances are you won't listen to them lightly if you're paying attention to them. Layne Staley's pain was all too real and it's palpable on DIRT. Now he's dead and gone with him one of the greatest rock voices ever. Full of confusion, frustration and hate, these songs are a testament to Layne's agonizing life as a junkie.<br /><br />Only \\"Junkhead\\" offers a cynical endorsement of a druggie's lifestyle. Death is a much more common subject, but not fear of death - rather, longing for it such as on \\"Sickman\\" in which a fly is deemed lucky for living only a day.<br /><br />Death also figures prominently on \\"Down in a Hole,\\" the softest track but probably the best song. It's beautifully orchestrated. \\"Would?\\" and \\"Angry Chair\\" are the other strong contenders for best song and they're VERY heavy.<br /><br />Jerry Cantrell wrote most of the album and, apparently, a great deal of the lyrics which is probably a good indication as to what degree he's \\"been there\\" himself as the lyrics are so compelling. More than anything, though, Cantrell is a master axeman who's solos are nothing short of mind-blowing.<br /><br />This is scorching if typically downbeat rock (metal? - certainly a template for grunge). They do take more than a cue from Black Sabbeth at times. Accusations of being derivative are not entirely unfounded, although their sheer talent outways their \\"influences\\" to a large extent. As is often the case, some songs are better than others, \\"Dam That River\\" being the weakest in my view. I don't think \\"Rooster\\" is the strongest song either although it gets plenty of radio play, even today. It's a song about Jerry's dad who apparently was a Vietnam soldier. The song fits in quite well with the \\"hell on earth\\" theme of the album.<br /><br />An aside: Layne's love, Demri, is the image on the cover. She died of an overdose and I read that Layne never recovered from her death. How sad that with legions around the world who cared about him, Layne, who lived his last days in solitude, picked up a needle and died alone.ad that with legions around the world who cared about him, Layne, who lived his last days in solitude, picked up a needle and died alone.
B00000K0EA|5.0|&quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; is the eighteenth overall James Bond Film and the second wonderful film starring Pierce Brosnan in the lead role as James Bond.  Of his first four films in that role I would definitely have to say that this one ranks up there with his first performance as Bond, James Bond.  From the fast paced action sequences to the overall premise of the film, &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; entertains from the very first scene to last as everybody involved in the making of this film did exactly what they intended to do with a Bond film, which is making one to remember!<br />Performance wise, Pierce Brosnan furthers that which he started in &quot;Goldeneye&quot; by making the role his as he brings a darker and harsher yet capably witty tone to Bond that hadn't been seen in a Bond film since the first James Bond himself, Sean Connery.  I would caveat that in that I thought Timothy Dalton accomplished that as well but as he was only allowed to do two films in the role I must be in the minority on that opinion.<br />As with all James Bond films, we're treated to a pair of new Bond babes in Teri Hatcher and international martial arts superstar Michelle Yeoh, both of which are incredibly beautiful and talented actresses.  Although Teri Hatcher's role in this film is a very brief one, I would definitely have to say it was memorable.  Michelle Yeoh's role in this film brings her right up there with James Bond himself as far as the action sequences go.  It is most certainly interesting to see a Bond film turn into a Bruce Lee film in a particularly eventful sequence.<br />Director Roger Spottiswoode who may best be known for &quot;Air America&quot; or even &quot;The 6th Day&quot; does a great job with this film, solidifying his status as a quite capable director of action films.<br />The Premise:<br />This wonderful Bond film in reality has two great opening sequences as we're treated to the standard pre main title James Bond super action sequence which involves 007 infiltrating a Black Market auction of high tech military equipment and him stirring things up and then we're treated to a sequence in which the villain of the film is rousing things up between the British Navy and the Chinese Air Force off the coast of China which adds a wonderful dramatic element to the feel of the entire film.<br />What follows from there is one of the best Bond films to date as James Bond does what he does best, save the world from total disaster while getting a babe or two in the process...<br />I highly recommend this eighteenth Bond film to any and all fans of the series and to those who like great action films that actually have a plot as well.  {ssintrepid}<br />Special Features:<br />This particular DVD is a bit threadbare when it comes to Special Features but in the end, what are these DVD's all about, the movie and it's a great one.<br />-8 Page Booklet Featuring Trivia, Production Notes and a Revealing Look at the Making of the Film.<BR>-Original Theatrical Trailer
B0000CFW87|5.0|His voice is so big and so assured, that it's refreshing. Rarely can someone demonstrate such power and passion in the same song, but Josh does so skillfully. You can play the CD straight through without disappointment. I look forward to more great recordings in the future.
B00011RPB0|1.0|It was so bad.<br />I am worried that somebody reading this might think there was a worse movie made than this in 2003, so I am choosing my words carefully. <br />First, I suggest people who want to make a living writing, directing or producing movies to avoid this so it doesn't in any way influence the way you judge what is considered creative.<br />I am convinced the movie was filmed in one day and the rest of the money that was supposed to go toward making it was stolen.<br />This movie did more to undermine the credibility of the Academy than &quot;The Crying Game&quot;. I feel that the Oscar nomination is now firmly an economic device that has abandoned all sense of artistic merit.<br />All because of this movie. <br />I don't understand why so many individuals give this movie 5 stars while at the same time pointing out that this movie could understandably bore the hell out of someone.<br />This movie would make a good public service announcement as to what it is really like to suffer with depression because the experience was depressing, and not in an entertaining way.<br />This movie was also very racist to the Japanese. I am embarrassed that this was given an Oscar nomination and profoundly apologize to the nation of Japan as a whole.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I must admit, as much as I'm all for girl power, but I was skeptical about Sophia Coppolla's win on her first film.  Did she get it because of her name or her talent?  I heard a story on NPR last week that was about a tape recording of her as a child that she made.  Even in this recording of a moment of her childhood, I heard the thoughts of a brilliant young girl.  Then I saw it.  My god, it's brilliant.  I completely understood what she was trying to say verbally and symbolically.  There are so many layers to this film that it's almost as enjoyable to realize them, as it is to watch them unfold.  And the music is brilliant and perfect.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This film is about nothing. There is no intellect. There is no inspiration. It goes nowhere, and starts nowhere. Instead, it uses the Japanese people and their culture as comedic devices. Unfortunately, it was disrespectful, insulting, and racist. This movie isn't even worth a one-star rating. It's definitely on my worst list. I wouldn't even wish this movie upon my worst enemy. Yes, it was just that bad.<br />It's unfortunate when people have to put other cultures down in order to feel good about themselves. Sofia said she wanted to make a movie in Japan, but she should have left this one on the cutting-room floor. The entire movie is \\"Lost in Translation.\\" Can someone explain to me the purpose in making a movie with no plot, empty characters, and meaningless dialog??? You can't, because it would be a fruitless exercise. <br />Hollywood likes boring, derogatory crap with big names attached to it, and this is all the proof you will need.
6304083777|5.0|An existential action anime?  That's what Ghost In The Shell, a.k.a. Kokakukidotai (Shell Mobile Force) is, with animation sporting top-of-the-line computer imagery in the Bladerunner-like metropolis of Newport, but that's secondary compared to the underlying intellectual theme.<br />Major Kusanagi Motoko is a skillfully trained cyborg assassin in Newport's Section 9, who's taking out a diplomat illegally trying to give immunity to a listed programmer, demonstrates her training, including an amazing moment when she dives off a building, picks off her target, and via a thermoptic camouflage (i.e. portable cloaking device), vanishes from sight.<br />She and the members of her team, consisting of the mostly human Togusa, Ichikawa, and Batou, a burly no-nonsense blond cyborg with electronic eye implants, are trying to track down the Puppet Master.  The Puppet Master is a master hacker who hacks into people's brains and uses them for his dirty work, presumably to carry out espionage or terrorism, leaving his puppets no memory of their infiltration.  One of his puppets keeps using a public computer to try to infiltrate the brain of his wife, who is divorcing him and wants custody of their child.  When he's picked up, he is told by Section 9 that his wife, child, and divorce are all false memories imprinted by the Puppet Master, causing further distress to the man when he is told the fake memories can't be erased.<br />However, there are two conflicts going on.  One is Kusanagi's mission to hunt down the Puppet Master.  The other and the one with a deeper meaning is the search for her identity within the scheme of a whole, or rather, something beyond her individual self, highlighted by her words taken from the Book of Corinthians:  &quot;For now we through a glass, darkly.&quot;  This reflects an earlier statement when she says in observation of a victim of the Puppet Master, &quot;all data that exists is both fantasy and reality.  Whichever it is, the data a person collects in a lifetime is a tiny bit compared to the whole.&quot;  A postmodernist flair is introduced when the Puppet Master says  &quot;While memories may as well be the same as fantasy, it is by these memories that mankind exists.&quot;<br />The question thus is, is it possible for the soul to exist in a highly technological world, where special operatives have cyborg shells, metabolic control systems, ESP, and cyber-brains?<br />The search is also symbolized when she surfaces, and the animated image of her rising up to meet her reflection, representing her true self.  She wonders if she has a ghost, an animating soul or spirit.  In looking at the construction of her body in the opening credits, one sees that she's heavily mechanized, with an outer layer of flesh surrounding her.<br />Her attempt at defining the self begins with a unique face, voice, childhood memories, feelings for the future, and the set of mental processes producing a consciousness that is &quot;me.&quot;  However, upon a discovery involving the Puppet Master, she further worries that what if there wasn't a real &quot;me,&quot; that &quot;I believe I exist based only on what my environment tells me. ... What if a computer brain can generate a ghost and harbor a soul?  On what basis then do I believe in myself?&quot;  In other words, what if there is no higher power to connect to, bringing into mind the word &quot;religion,&quot; which means &quot;to reconnect to.&quot;<br />The action sequences aren't extreme, ultraviolent, or gratuitous in the chase sequences, but are moderate, that is until the heavy artillery is brought out, at which point glass, metal, and rock starts to fly.  A very intelligent, thought-provoking, one-of-a-kind existential, soul-searching anime, with Kusanagi despite its cyborg dominance showing some human traits.ts in a lifetime is a tiny bit compared to the whole.&quot;  A postmodernist flair is introduced when the Puppet Master says  &quot;While memories may as well be the same as fantasy, it is by these memories that mankind exists.&quot;<br />The question thus is, is it possible for the soul to exist in a highly technological world, where special operatives have cyborg shells, metabolic control systems, ESP, and cyber-brains?<BR>The search is also symbolized when she surfaces, and the animated image of her rising up to meet her reflection, representing her true self.

B00005JMJ4|1.0|This is one of the worst movies to ever end up on film. Don't waste your money. Wait until it comes on DirecTV, Cable, HBO, or Showtime. Rent it at Blockbuster Video. This is not a five-star movie. Don't be fooled by the hype that is being generated to empty your pocketbooks. She won an Oscar because she had a famous last name. Without it, this movie never would have left the port. This was a racist flop of epic proportions. Please don't judge good movies according to the standards this trashy movie has set forth.

B000002KO1|5.0|I have been listening to (and loving, and rabidly recommending, and freaking out over, and obsessing over) this record for over twenty of my thirty-four years. What band's debut is better? What record is more packed full of brilliantly intense and intensely brilliant songwriting, playing, and singing? <br />If you're serious about learning the history of rock music, you should hear this record. If you want to hear one of the first records to offer a woman's perspective in the largely testosterone-choked legacy of punk rock, you should hear this record. If you love intelligent lyrics, incendiary musicianship, and flat-out brilliant songwriting, you should hear this record. If you want to hear music that makes you feel alive, you should hear this record! <br />Considering the six bucks I spent to buy it back in the 1980s, Chrissie Hynde and company have given me so much pleasure in the ensuing 20+ years that the entertainment value is beyond measure. To me, this ranks with the 1st Modern Lovers and Velvet Underground records and Marquee Moon in terms of flawless, timeless debut albums. This is one for the ages.
B00006LSM3|5.0|Bottom line, I love this album.  I absolutely love it.  I am speaking as a fan, not a music critic.  And as a fan, I see nothing to critisize in Brainwashed.  The first couple of times I listened to the album, it didn't grab me.  By the third time through I realized I was completely hooked.  The album has so many great songs that it is hard for me to even pick a favorite.  And the songs are so touching.  If I have a glass or two of wine I find myself weeping over the beauty embodied in this great music.  It's truly a gift from George to anyone who bothers to listen.  Buy it.  Listen to it.  You won't be sorry.  It's beautiful.
0312995423|3.0|I liked most of this book, however the end was really annoying to me. The characters were like &quot;Oh no, what is an element?&quot; ... quite irksome. Dan Brown was very good at making you think one thing happened, and then turning right around again and throwing you off. (which is a good thing)
B000059H99|5.0|You know, for being an Oscar-winning movie and an reviewer for Amazon, you would think that Jeff Shannon would get the review correct.  He said that Rocky's manager was named &quot;Gus?&quot;  Have you actually seen the film Jeff, or did you just collect bits and pieces for different reviews?  Who is Gus?  Rocky's trainer, played by Burgess Meredith, was named Mickey.  God man.  Take some pride in your work.<br />Oh yeah, the movie's great.  The best of the Rocky series and after Rocky II it all goes downhill.
0380789035|5.0|This is the first book I've read by Neil Gaiman.  It won't be the last.<br />AMERICAN GODS is about a man named Shadow.  He is a good man, who did his time for a small crime.  Getting out of prison, he learns that his wife has died.  Flying home for her funeral, he meets a man named Mr. Wendseday, who offers Shadow a job...and seems to know more about Shadow than Shadow does...<br />Shadow finds himself in a world of myriad dangers and mysteries.  What seems to be one thing is in fact another; the danger comes from places he never even dreamed possible.  Is he going insane...or is the explanation for all this too great to comprehend?<br />This novel is, at times, a bit harder to understand.  However, with patience (a rudimentary knowledge of mythology won't hurt, either) everything comes together in the end, for a wham-bam conclusion that'll leave you reeling.<br />Neil Gaiman is obviously a talented author.  AMERICAN GODS is one of the best novels I've read in quite a while.  Give it a try.  Just be careful: you might not want to put it down.
B00005YXZH|4.0|Perhaps two of the best things to happen to Wilco is to (a) change record labels, and (b) have producer extraordinaire Jim O'Rourke at the helm. With expectations low after their exit from Warner/Reprise, 'Yankee Hotel Foxtrot' is Wilco's shining masterpiece, twangy roots-rock meets neo-psychadelia. The bitter departure actually translated into more creative control. O'Rourke brings an added ingredient to the table, a childrens workshop-type experimentalism that compliments Jeff Tweedy's emotionally drenched vocals. An outpouring of soul meets ecclectic arrangements/instruments, yet still within the bounds of Wilco's earthy 'wine in casks of oak' alt-country sound. After the opening surreal haze of 'I Am Trying to Break Your Heart', this CD clanks and rings, romps and weeps, a self-examination of the human spirit. You get the sense you're empathizing with someones joy and pain, paired with a musical child genius inquisitively toying around in an instrument-filled playroom. 'Yankee Hotel Foxtrot' is powerful as it is mystical, an awakening as it is a desperate search, an intimate journey into your musical soul.
B00007BHOE|5.0|This dvd had incredible solos from Sid and Joey. Sid plays on the turntable and Joey plays on the drums if yuo didn't know. There solos alone are worth the price.

Eventually, guys are showing up to work all bruised and there seems to a knowing when one sees the other.<br />As the movie progresses, we are not sure what is real and what is in the mind of one of the main characters.<br />There have been other movies that seem to depict fights in back rooms and garages (Jean Claude Van Damme did Lionheart).  This movie is definately the best of the bunch.
B0000844IT|5.0|BRUCE CAMBELL is awesome in this one. This movie is hilarious. It is a two disc set.

One from close up slow motion. One from side, and one in fast motion from far away. There might be more but I am not sure. <br />        This movie is great for a action, comedy fans. it's worth the money.
B00000JPHF|1.0|The problem with this film is that it's a very poor adaptation of Mary Shelley's gothic novel. If I recall, the first scene is of Dr. F-- at a cemetery to exhume body parts. There's no build up. The next scene or so sees Dr. F-- in his lab with the creature, and get this, he spills the beans of what he's about to do. It was at this point I stopped watching. Did the producers of this film actually read the book? Also, the acting is heavy handed and overwrought. Really, almost unwatchable. How did it ever become such a classic? The only thing I can think of is that most of the filmgoers have never read the novel.
B00005KHJM|4.0|It helps to go into &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; with only the barest plot details: a prim Scottish policeman investigates a girl's disappearance in a remote island community.  The film begins with a title card thanking the &quot;Lord Summerisle&quot; for his assistance, so you know this, like &quot;Fargo&quot; and &quot;Blair Witch&quot;, is based on real life.  After a panoramic look at the islands off the west coast of Scotland, accompanied by Scottish folk music, Sergeant Howie arrives at Summerisle, and is instantly told by about ten grizzled islanders that he's arrived at &quot;private property&quot;.  For this is an island where those with Biblical names (Rachel and Benjamin) have long since died, and all the adults and children are named after trees: Myrtle, Willow, Ash, Oak, Rowan.  Christians like Howie no longer have a place here.<br />This setup is evocative of dozens of Hammer Horror movies and other British television horror (several &quot;Avengers&quot; and &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episodes spring to mind), all of which begin with the suspicious villagers who clearly have something to hide.  So it's a credit to Anthony Shaffer's script that, as Howie's investigation unfolds, his own sense of revulsion soars right past the usual level of &quot;disgusted&quot; and goes all the way to &quot;mortal fear&quot;.<br />The theme of the movie is &quot;hunted leading the hunter&quot;.  It helps to keep an eye out for all the clues Howie misses along the way (at one point, Christopher Lee wearily asks, &quot;Aren't you supposed to be the detective?&quot;).  When Howie finally finds his objective, that's when the real trap unfolds about him.  I love the staging of the penultimate sequence high on the cliffs, almost as much as I love the staging of the final scene.<br />Also of note is that the Wicker Man himself, the title character, is not even alluded to until those final moments.  I'm not sure if it helps or hurts that I didn't know what a Wicker Man was until I watched the making-of documentary on the DVD (&quot;The Wicker Man Enigma&quot;) after I'd seen the feature itself.  Maybe I haven't seen enough British pagan horror.  What's undeniable, though, is the effect his appearance has on Howie, and that's where the movie generates its real power.<br />Look carefully for the DVD's easter egg, what appears to be a 1970's film discussion program from Louisiana.  An overweight American in a powder-blue suit gushes his love for the film to studio guests Lee and director Robin Hardy.  One of the film sequences played on the program is a scene deleted from the theatrical release, and only restored for the DVD limited edition: Christopher Lee and the amorous snails.  The most fun part of this show is when the host enthusiastically compares Hardy to a young American director whose TV-movie debut, &quot;Duel&quot;, recently found theatrical success on the Continent.  He calls that man &quot;Steven Shpielberg&quot;.
B0001ADB8C|5.0|Quite why it's taken so long for this vital part of Harrison's catalogue to be issued on CD is anybody's guess but hopefully these six albums will now get the attention they deserve.<br />All Beatles fans should own the box set - it's beautifully presented with a bonus DVD which runs to a generous 75 mins. <br />There's also bonus tracks on five of the CDs and a wonderfully presented booklet filled with interesting and unseen pictures.<br />The price may put some people off - my advice is to shop around on the internet where it can be found for less than $100 (around £60 UK). For six CDs and a DVD I would say that's good value for money.<br />For those not prepared to take the plunge I suggest cherry-picking the Cloud Nine and George Harrison CDs. But I warn you that once you've heard them you'll want the others as well and you'll regret not buying the box set in the first place!<br />Harrison never repeated the genius of All Things Must Pass on these later albums but the way they've been collectively ignored borders on the criminal.<br />The time to discover the George Harrison back catalogue is upon us. Have a listen - you won't be disappointed.
B00006690G|5.0|The Eminem Show, wow is one of the few words that I can use to describe this album and Eminem's musical talent. With this album he is officially the number one artist in the world. I picked this album up the first day that it came out, and I honestly was not the biggest Eminem fan in the world. I respected his music and it was cool because it didn't sound like anything out at the time and the lyrics were hilarious at times. But when I threw this into my c.d. player I didn't get what I was expecting. On this album we get a more serious Marshall Mathers, and his rhymes have grown noticably greater with this album. Even throughout the record Em' raps that he's now number one in the game. Like in tracks, &quot;Bussiness&quot;, or &quot;Square Dance&quot;. There is also some of that classic Slim Shady humor in the album on tracks like, &quot;Without Me&quot;, and the hilarious &quot;My Dad's Gone Crazy&quot; which features Eminems only daughter Hailie. He even stretches the creativity again with the touching &quot;Hailie's Song&quot; in which we hear Eminem's singing voice for the first time. He even pokes fun at himself at singing while on a rap hook he say's, &quot;Man if could sing i'd keep singing this song to my daughter, if I could hit the notes i'd blow something as long as my father.&quot; But for most of the record Em' shows his serious side with classic tracks such as, &quot;Cleanin' out my closet&quot; where he raps about his childhood with his mother, or &quot;Til' i collapse&quot; which has to be heard to believe. What's so great about this album and about Eminem is that through all the things he raps about he still shows us that somewhere inside him is a real person and a real artist. Before lyrically destroying his mother on his final verse on &quot;Cleanin' out my closet&quot; he shows us this by saying, &quot;Now I would never diss' my own momma just to get recognition, take a second to listen before you think who this record is dissin, but put yourselfin my position.&quot; To make a long review short, this album is one, if not the greatest rap album ever made. What a show it is!
B000022TSY|5.0|&quot;Easy Rider&quot; is one of the best releases of 1969.  Dennis Hopper starred, directed, and wrote this film.  It received two Oscar nominations: Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor (Jack Nicholson).  This film has since been held as a history cornerstone, educating viewers the true lifestyles during the 1960's, namely the hippies.  Its camera effects are brilliant, though some were accidental.  Though accidental, the film's impact wouldn't be nearly as intense.  Such effect places it ahead of its time remains influencial to modern-day films.  The plot of two motorbikers on a mission to make a drug deal is brilliant.  The people they meet and the experiences they live add a lot of originality to the film.  The accuracy of the lifestyles prove the writers did their research.  The acting is flawless, namely Dennis Hopper, Peter Fonda, and Jack Nicholson.  This film is what deservingly placed the then-unknown Nicholson into higher fame territory.  &quot;Easy Rider&quot; is a great movie for those looking for a great classic or a great history refresher.  This is sure to continue pleasing audiences for many more years.  Those looking for more should also buy the &quot;Easy Rider&quot; Sdtk., which contains great psychedelic rock and great &quot;biker-pride&quot; songs.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I am Japanese. I have taught English as a foreign language. I want to explain a little about the confusion between L and R that this film makes fun of. In fact, many Japanese do not confuse l and r. What they do is pronounce it in a way that is half way between the two, which corresponds to a Japanese pronunciation. So they will say &quot;corlesponds&quot; or &quot;corllector&quot;. Those with better English skills will probably not do this. <br />When Westerners hear it they find the &quot;wrong&quot; part of the sound more noticeable than the right part, so they often think that people are saying it with an l for an r, or an r for an l. <br />Many Japanese can hear this for themselves, so pointing it out in SOME characters - as this film does - not all, is perfectly acceptable to me. Even in &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; you can hear this sometimes.<br />There is a poet who said it was interesting to see ourselves as others see us. I think &quot;Lost in Tranlsation&quot; is a beautiful and sensitive film that would make many directors proud. Some people only like films about stories. Others like more the movies about human beings. This is a film about human beings. And I like very much these films about human beings. In the Oscars Sofia Coppola mentioned the work of Wong Kar-wai, which is also romantic, and - for the ones who like car crash films - slow. I think this is very  much like a Wong Kar-wai film.
0385504209|2.0|I am not sure why it is so popular... probably just because some pseudo-scientific remarks regarding Catholic Faith. I could stand only half of it. If you are looking for a good suspense book, you will be better off with Frederick Forsyth.
B00005JKZV|5.0|Please, watch The Lord of the Rings:Two Towers.You are going to love as well i loved too.The sound is incredible, the battles in the film are magnificant.Elijah Wood proved why he is in my opinion the best actor in the movie.Peter Jackson is now with the trilogy in the hall of fame of the directors in my opinion with Steven Spielperg and George Lucas.My favorite in this film is Saruman and Galdalf.<BR>This film is precious............
B0000DD7LB|1.0|First off, i'm laughing hard at these 5 star reviews. Do these people have any clue what music is? Do they know that music is an art? Anyway, my advice is stay away from this load of crap as much as you can. How horrible has music become? Why should such &quot;artists&quot; exist and sell(!!!) their garbage to the public?<BR>If you want real music head over to the &quot;British&quot; music sites. You'll find plenty of great bands in britain. I'm not british but i always believe that the best music is made in britain.
B00008GKEG|5.0|The Beatles:Anthology in other things, the best rock and roll dvd in my opinion.The brilliant carrer of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr explain everything.In this DVD you find the America reception to the band in 1964(you can find it in more details on the DVD The First US Visit), the Beatles's shows in England in 1963, clips, live shows like the Shea Stadium Concert(In my opinion the best Beatles live show).<BR>I like too the tracks like Revolution(John play the guitar very well).And finaly, this DVD bring the history of the band and in my opinion is very important to know all things about the Beatles.
B000127LW2|4.0|Like all Star Treks the series starts a bit in the stupid goofy story way but evolved into one of my favorite Star Trek series. <br />The reason I give it a 4 star rating is because of: <BR>1) this is the worst package I have encountered, hate it (the case). Deep Space 9 was the best packaging.<BR>2) The whole star trek series is totally a rip off cost wise. twice the price of all other series. (greedy!!!)<BR>I think I'll buy bootlegs of Enterprise since they have already taken more money than they are all worth.<br />I love watching series this way...
0440238609|4.0|Philip Pullman takes on a huge, complicated set of ideas and concepts in this work.  He has been compared to Tolkien, and certainly there are some similarities.  Like Tolkien, he takes on epic ideas that fork into multiple ideas and sub-threads.  Like Tolkien, the first book was written as an introduction to the characters and main themes, and one gets the sense that Pullman himself did not fully understand the scope his work would eventually take by the third book.  However, unlike Tolkien, Pullman's work is so vast that it actually gets away from him - the themes and major ideas he wishes to convey are closed, but the ideas are so diverse that the tie-ins seem contrived and stretched.<br />The first book introduces us to the idea of infinite parallel worlds, connected by something called \\"Dust\\".  In one particular world, the soul is a physical extension from the body, a reflection of a person's true nature that takes animal forms called \\"daemons\\".  The girl Lyra is caught in the middle of a struggle between opposing forces, each of which seem to be evil. Lyra's true path lies tied to both, and Pullman let's his imagination run wild, keeping the themes relatively simple - the concept of Dust, the concept of Daemons, and really neat ideas like armored talking bears and beautiful long-lived witches.<br />The second book introduces us to a second protagonist, Will, who learns to wield a knife that can cut windows between worlds.  However, now we learn that the war of opposing forces is really a war between God and Reason, with Dust (which we learn are particles of dark matter that \\"are\\" consciousness) the constant between worlds.  We gain the full measure of how evil Lyra's mother is, how ambitious her Father is, and are introduced to angels and vampire-like specters.<br />The third book takes off, with concepts of death, souls, ghosts, angels, the true nature of God, particle physics, existence, Love, and the end of the battle between God/church and Reason.  These are huge concepts, and Pullman has a very hard time keeping them all in line while maintaining all the characters.  Certainly the concepts themselves are incredible, but half-way through the third book Pullman stops developing lesser themes, concentrating on the battle between God and Reason, Good and Bad, and Life, Death, and the sum parts of consciousness (Body, Soul, Ghost).  <br />Overall, Pullman's writing style is excellent, he has an incredible imagination, the works are dark and very deep, and he tackles ideas most writers would never dare tackle (and those who have tried usually fare much much worse). Had he been able to successfully tie everything together, these would be masterful epics, worthy of comparison to Tolkien or Lewis.  As they stand they are very good, far deeper and richer than the oft-compared Potter series.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I don't know what's up with some of these reviewers, but this was a terrific movie.  It was happy, it was sad, it was pretty damn funny too.  Someone said the characters are mean...well, people are mean.  It doesn't portray anything fantastical, just some lonely people stuck in Tokyo making friends.
0385504209|1.0|You've got to be kidding me - *THIS* book has sold over 6 million copies and become an international sensation?  That a book this badly written, characterised and plotted can be a runaway best seller is bad enough.  That the ludicrous conspiracy theory it peddles, in between all the cliches, terrible dialogue and hackneyed chase scenes, is actually being given creedence by some readers is much, much worse.<br />This is an astonishingly stupid, stupid, stupid book.<br />Other reviewers have already outlined Brown's flaws as an author, but what bothers me most is the way favourable reviewers (including some professionals) keep talking about his \\"impeccable research\\".  Did we read the same novel?  Anyone who is familiar with \\"Holy Blood, Holy Grail\\" would recognise that about 80% of the (ahem) \\"information\\" Langdon drones on and on and on about has been lifted directly from that classic piece of lowbrow, pulp, pseudo-historical conspiracy.<br />In fact, on the first page of Chapter 60 Brown effectively gives the reader his whole bibliography:  Lincoln, Baigent and Leigh's \\"Holy Blood, Holy Grail\\", Picknett and Prince's \\"The Templar Revelation\\", and Margaret Starbird's \\"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar\\" and \\"The Goddess in the Gospels\\".  These four books - widely ridiculed and utterly discredited pieces of paperback speculation of no academic standing whatsoever - represents the bulk of Brown's \\"impeccable historical research\\".  That he is able to convince people that the pastiche of nonsense he extracts from these crackpot books is credible says something about our culture's historical illiteracy.<br />And about its chronic lack of informed critical thinking.  An intelligent 12 year old would be able to dispose of much of Brown's \\"impeccable research\\" given access to an internet connection or a decent encyclopaedia.<br />Brown has one characters lecture about the suppressed gospels found amongst the Dead Sea Scrolls - a 15 second search on Google could tell you that *NO* gospels or Christian writings of any kind were found in the Qumran material.<br />Brown says the Council of Nicea set the canon of the New Testament.  A few minutes browsing reveals that the canon was *not even discussed* at that Council and that an official canon was not set until the Council of Trent 1300 years later.<br />Brown says that the Witch Craze was orchestrated by \\"the Vatican\\" and resulted in \\"five million\\" women being burnt by \\"the Inquisition\\".  In fact, the Witch Craze was a largely *Protestant* phenomenon, the numbers killed over a 300 year period are around 20-50,000 and 20% of them were men.<br />And so it goes on.  Virtually everything Brown presents as \\"fact\\" in this stupid novel is either wrong, completely wrong or wildly and unbelieveably wrong.  Many of those who have criticised this book have been Catholics - which is understandable, considering how their Church is presented in the book.  But this book is not just offensive to believers (I'm an atheist), it's an insult to anyone with a knowledge of medieval history and the history of early Christianity.  Or anyone with a brain.<br />I'm with the others who have recommened Umberto Eco's \\"Foucault's Pendulum\\" instead - it's smart, well written, amusing and well researched.  And, unlike \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" it laughs at stupid conspiracy theories.  Brown's terrible novel shows why they deserve to be ridiculed.<br />One star because you can't give them no stars.  Terrible.*NO* gospels or Christian writings of any kind were found in the Qumran material.<br />Brown says the Council of Nicea set the canon of the New Testament.

B00005JMEW|5.0|This is not my kind of movie.  I don't like action films, fighting, killing, etc...it is all very boring.  Ususally.  Kill Bill Vol. 1 was one of the best films I saw last year.  I saw it twice in the theater, it was just so entertaining.  The audience never loses interest.  I even liked the soundtrack.  Bang bang...five stars.
067101756X|5.0|Having read the TOP Four books in the UFO/Alien/ Government Coverup Genre; My FAVORITE is 'Alien Rapture' by Brad Steiger (Great fiction-soon to be a movie); and Alien Agenda by the best selling author of 'Crossfire' Jim Marrs (Best reference on UFOlogy); and Unconventional Flying Objects (NASA UFO Investigator for 30 years) by the scientist Dr. Paul Hill, I'd say Corso's book is a MUST READ! <br />Why would a respected, decorated, connected Military Officer swear in a Court of Law that the UFO Conspiracy is real and that the facts and agenda in these books ARE TRUE. <br />Why? If you read this excellent book and the others, you will know that they are indeed true. Two well respected American Astronauts have come forward to proclaim they had seen evidence of the Roswell UFO crash and stated they know the cover-up is real. Was his sudden demise a product of this conspiracy? You be the judge.
B000063UR2|5.0|Deep down I know that &quot;Legend&quot; is a bizzare film and that it was never a critical success, that its characters are one-dimensional and its story line is feather-light to say the least. And yet, there is something intoxicating about its simplicity, its atmosphere and its deeper fairytale origins that make &quot;Legend&quot; fascinating for me personally.<br />As I mentioned, the story is painfully simple, so simple as to be found ludicrous by some viewers: Princess Lili and Jack-of-the-Green enjoy an idyllic fairytale lifestyle in the forest, until one day when Jack shows Lili the magnificent unicorns that make up one side of an eternal balance of Good and Evil. Lili can't resist: she approaches the unicorns, and by doing so creates the perfect trap for goblins to steal the stallion's horn. Winter suddenly grips the land as the balance is disrupted.<br />Lili and the remaining unicorn are captured and taken to Darkness's lair, where the Lord of Darkness becomes fascinated by Lili's purity and takes it upon himself to corrupt her before destroying the last unicorn. Meanwhile, Jack teams up with a group of faeries in order to prevent these two events from occuring.<br />A not-quite-famous-yet Tom Cruise plays Jack, in a role that is painfully underdeveloped. Running around with a loincloth and a sword as the archetypal hero-warrior is something he would probably like to forget. The character has no depth, no background and no interest. However, no one can dispute that Cruise became famous for a reason, and in his hands the dialouge is not as bad as it would sound coming out of a lesser man. It's a bad role, but he carries it as best he can.<br />The real stars of the show are Tim Curry as the Lord of Darkness (basically the devil), and Mia Sara as Lili. Only Curry's voice is recognisable under tons of prosthetics, and he plays his role with both malevolence and a touch of sympathy. He comes across as evil incarnate, but as an evil that is ultimately lonely, and who believes that his role as darkness is necessary for the existence of goodness and light. It is this view he tries to justify to his chosen bride Lili, as gradually she falls under his dominion.<br />Mia Sara goes through a radical change with Lili, from the light-hearted Princess, to the desparate runaway to the black-clad bride; a change that is fascinating to behold. Whether you love this movie or not, I guarantee that you will not soon forget Lili's experience with the faceless black dress that lures her into dancing. She handles both incarnations of her character amazingly well, understanding that in being pure and innocent (ie, being a child) means a degree of selfishness and disregard for the rules must also exist, and as she falls from grace into temptation and evil, she keeps a touch of her humanity that allows her to uphold her end of the philosophical debate she shares with Darkness (I only wish there was more of it!). She's stunning, and like the Childlike Empress in &quot;The Neverending Story&quot;, you can't take your eyes off her.<br />The visual beauty of this film is perhaps its strongest point. Dispite the wobbly horns of the unicorns, the forest is everyone's dream-forest, awash with colours, petals, flowers, moss, water and trees. Likewise, the Darkness's domain is stunning in its scale and opulence, and its ability to be both beautiful and completely sinister.<br />As your typical mainstream movie it fails, as only a small percentage will enjoy its oddness, but succeeds as a dark fairytale that is potent with themes of trial, temptation, sacrifice, lust and good and evil. As an English scholar at university with a special interest in folklore and mythology it seems only natural that this movie would appeal to me, and to anyone else who has an interest in such things.<br />When I was a child I remember watching this movie (so yes, nostalgia does mean my five-star rating is rather biased), but when the Lord of Darkness appeared through themirror I was thoroughly freaked out (proof that this movie *isn't* a kid-friendly fantasy), turned off the television and regretted it ever since. For years I wondered how Jack, Lili and the faeries managed in their battle against Darkness, until one day whilst browsing Amazon.com I found myself reading a review that described a very familiar storyline. One phonecall to the video-store later, I was settling down to finally finish the story. I recommend this movie, but not for those of a cynical or critical mind. You probably already know whether you'll love or hate this movie, and now you've been warned of its pitfalls - so take a risk, especially now with the more complete special edition that gives it a new soundtrack and a less-frantic pace.

0385510438|2.0|Really frustrating to spend all this time reading a book that juts goes nowhere. I just can't believe this was the same author who wrote the runaway jury, a time to kill and the firm. This book was basically like a &quot;painted house&quot; with a sprinkle of suspense. Disappointing!
B000089RVX|5.0|The first time I heard 'Bring Me To Life' I was in the car with my daughter. 'WHO IS THAT BAND?' When she told me 'Evanescence', I went to a record store that same day and bought the CD. 'Bring Me To Life' will forever be my favorite song on the CD, as well as one of my favorite songs of all time. Amy's vocal and Paul McCoy's rap really work well together. My other favorite is 'Hello'. Amy's voice and the haunting melody just sends chills down my spine. 'Evanescence' were very deserving of their two Grammys. In my opinion, they should have received one for each of the five categories they were nominated. So many people try to label them, but I consider them to be 'rock', period. They cross all genres, having been featured on, I believe, seven different Billboard charts, from Adult Top 40 to Modern Rock. Quite simply, they are a GREAT band with a GREAT CD. Buy it, you can't help but love it!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Fifty years from now or so, we will still be discussing \\"Lost in Translation\\".  It is a movie that is not about 'nothing' but a film with the stillness of everyday life at its center.  The performances are so finely nuanced that they no longer seem like \\"Acting\\" as the movie barely seems to be \\"Directed\\"; the transparency that is achieved by this work of artistic creation will grow as the years pass by  -  as we strive, in contrast, fifty years from now, to remember the name of that year's oscar-winning director whose amalgam of sound and fury signify, ultimately, nothing.  -  I must add, four years later, that this film is best seen in the theater.  It is marvelous on DVD as well; it's just that there is something gained by this work when the images we witness are truly 'larger than life'.
0780619668|5.0|I can't stress enough how important it is for anyone considering seeing this movie to ignore the heaps of negative reviews here.  Most justify their opinions by calling this film strange, grotesque, or both.  Both are fitting, but there's alot more to this film than that, and those two things in themselves are not necessarily reason to dislike a film.  Quite the contrary, when Hollywood is so overrun with unchallenging, unoriginal fodder. <br />I could praise the movie on any number of levels.  Every actor here carries his or her eccentric role with a perfectly tasteful care not to go over the top or become too cartoonish.  The dialogue is free of fluff and carries quite an element of eloquence, which is fitting when considering the overall dramatic intent.  On a more basic level, the creature effects used on the half human, half animal hybrid creations inhabiting Moreau's Island are handled by none other than Stan Winston and done very well, and the soundtrack is appropriately eerie, with tribal drumming used in parts to enhance the mood.  And, of course, the themes explored here, despite their familiarity (the power of instnct, and the danger of playing God), are driven home with potent efficiency, probably thanks to the extreme and sometimes bizzare nature in which they're handled.<br />The fact that this movie carries such a human element with it is what I really like about it.  It's easy to feel for the man-beasts, tragic abominations intelligent enough to know they're nothing but the waste products of a madman's search for genetic perfection.  The protagonist, as well, benefits from the fact that he is very much an introvert and probably speaks less than Val Kilmer, who is less vital to the plot.  His quiet observation helps add to the realism and mold a film which could have easily been a silly mess into a moving, artfully crafted piece of work.<br />If you choose to judge this movie as harshly as most have, then go ahead, but at least see it first with an open mind.  I for one feel a movie this bold deserves every bit of respect.
0316666343|2.0|I think the one thing that makes this book worthwhile is the authors poignant and yet not overtly sentimental description of how the love and fondness within a family evolves over time. Other than that, I thought the book exploits our natural fascination with human tragedy (the voyeuristic tendency to want to glimpse into the life of people whose lives are more dramatic than ours) to pass off a rather poorly written story. The characters are prototypical and glossed over. The only relationship that I thought was explored or described to some depth was the one between Lindsey and her father. <BR>The book itself is reasonably interesting but I think the writing is merely passable. I think the book is overhyped and that one's time is better spent reading one of the classics!
B000002H33|5.0|I definately subscribe to the idea that Master Of Puppets is Metallica's finest hour. The final Metallica which had Cliff Burton is truly their greatest work to date. Too many people class 'Metallica' as their greatest C.D, but i dont agree. Master of Puppets is an album which heavily leans on the theme of corruptions in soceity.<br />Battery: Is about sensless violence<BR>Master Of Puppets: This song is about drugs<BR>Welcome Home (Sanitarium):This song is about Mental disease<BR>Leper Messiah:This song is about false prophets<BR>Damage Inc:Is also about violence<br />This album contains many of the finest riffs you could ever wish to hear, on any heavy metal album. Particularly during Leper Messiah, Kirk Hammetts ability as a lead guitarist really shines through here. Battery is a true Metallica great. Along with 'Hit the Lights' from Metallica's 'Kill Em All' it is often used as their opening track for live shows. Welcome Home ((((Sanitarium) is many Metallica fans favourite song. It combines great riffs with harsh words, and the riff at the end is something to marvel at. Early Metallica albums, always seemed to contain one instrumental song, devoid of any lyrics. Orion fitted the bill on this album. It would certainly be classified as Metallica's geratest purely instrumental effort ever. It truly epitomises this truly great album.<br />My favourite song on this album, is the eponomous track 'Master of Puppets' which focusus on the effects of drugs, and the trouble it causes. Again this song contains a great Hammett riff, and the lyrics are great. This song is always played during live shows.<br />When i was at Metallica's show in the R.D.S Dublin, Metallica played more songs from this album, than any from the other 9. If that is the case it is truly a great album. And please, keep an open mind to the albums 'Load and 'Reload' those are great too

6305949980|4.0|Director Tim Burton delves us into the world of THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS, an fantastic stop-action animation fantasy, which begins in the scary world of Halloweentown, where the infamous town resident, Jack Skellington, becomes dreary of the tiring celebration of Halloween. But he then is magically transported to a wonderful land called Christmastown and is fascinated about it! He then convinces his fellow town to celebrate Christmas, and kidnap Santa Claus! But everything doesn't go according to plan.<br />NIGHTMARE, like any animated movie, has great songs, and also has a spooky atmosphere with scary characters from Halloweentown, including the rag-doll Sally, who is vying for Jack's affections, and Oogie-Boogie, the tormented entity. <br />This film is rated PG because it may scare some little kids with its adult humor, but they will eat it up anyway! This film is mostly recommended to people with an imagination!
B000002UB3|5.0|While &quot;Let It Be&quot; was released after it, &quot;Abbey Road&quot; was the last album The Beatles ever recorded, and boy what a swan song. It continued the trail paved by &quot;Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; and cemented by &quot;The White Album&quot;. I think that the group wanted to go out without a bang but a whimper. Unfortunately, they went out with a bang, as &quot;Abbey Road&quot; has been named by many as the greatest Beatles album of all time.<br />Kicking of with John's blazing &quot;Come Together&quot;, you can feel a sense of anger and distress listening to this album, almost as if you're hearing the group's actual breakup on tape. Next comes George Harrison's immortal &quot;Something&quot; to brighten the mood, with his calm vocal and smooth guitar. &quot;Maxwell's Silver Hammer&quot; is a cute number by Paul, while &quot;Oh! Darling&quot; recalls the 1950s' with its piano and heavenly McCartney vocal. &quot;Octopuss's Garden&quot; is all Ringo: the lyrics, the medlody and vocal. Looser and more rleaxed than &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;, this is a song that would actually appeal to kids as well. &quot;She's So Heavy&quot; is good but it goes on forever. &quot;Here Comes The Sun&quot; is bright and airy, with George Harrison's lyrics and gentle guitar picking conveying hope and longing. &quot;Because&quot; is another weird one with a droning and ultimately annoying harpsichord playing. Next is another quirky Paul composition, &quot;You Never Give Me Your Money&quot;. What comes next is one of the single best moments in recording histoy.<br />Knoen as the &quot;Abbey Road Suite&quot;, &quot;Sun King&quot;, &quot;Mean Mr. Mustard&quot;, &quot;Polythene Pam&quot;, &quot;She Came In Through The Bathroom Window&quot;, &quot;Golden Slumbers&quot;, &quot;Carry That Weight&quot; (which is a continuation of &quot;You Never Give Me Your Money&quot;) and &quot;The End&quot; are separate tracks that segue into each other, creating one long medleythat lasts a good 20 minutes. If you have XM Satellite Radio like I do, they sometimes play the whole medley. The album closes with &quot;Her Majesty&quot;, a cute ditty by Paul that clocks in at 23 seconds.<br />&quot;Abbey Road&quot; marks a pivtal end to possibly the greatest chapter inrock history. While &quot;Let It Be&quot; was released afterward, &quot;Abbey Road&quot; really marked the end. And what an end.
B0000509C4|1.0|Ok, I wrote a review of CREEPSHOW 2 not that long ago, and I just read a review by &quot;Tyreek, from the United States of America&quot; who I think called me a &quot;loser&quot; and with &quot;low-quality&quot; opinions&quot;. Whatever, TYREEK youre a low quality writer! I can say anything I want about this film! And you, with your poor &quot;taste&quot; of films, can't even spell director George Romero's last name! RAMANO! He's not a Soprano, you know! Anyway, later people. Hopefully you should think wisely by reviewing a good movie and not a bad one!
B0000VAFO0|4.0|I havent really seen a movie quite like this one. It seems a little far fetched for my taste but the story line is very good. If you like action, vampires, and werewolves then this movie is for you.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|This movie brilliantly explores the concept of the stable and sustainable affair, built by two people so responsible and so \\"nice\\" they would never seek such a thing, and once there never want harm to their spouses - but who find their new love as compelling as their first and as impossible to leave.  The origin of the affair here is almost an afterthought - the real focus is on the maturing of the new relationship across a huge span of years.<br />This movie resonates with me because it is my story - after finding one who would have been the love of my life more than 20 years ago but who was then engaged, I did the \\"proper\\" thing and let her go but never stopped loving her.  Meeting again several years ago, we realized the mistake and despite both being married with children we began to meet once a year at a college reunion, holding that time aside for us while the rest of the year belonged to our spouses.  The affair was not destined to mirror STNY (how did they ever keep it secret?  We couldn't...) but the feelings haven't changed - I just don't have the annual weekend to look forward to anymore...!!<br />The message of this movie that resonates so strongly is that it is possible to love two people deeply and romantically - and to sustain such feelings - and responsibilities - over a very long period.  A moral minefield?  Of course - but far from the typical Hollywood fantasy that filmgoers have difficulty identifying with.<br />The movie for me was a study of a situation that I have lived with for a long time - and I would wager that there are many like me who find understanding and solace in this film.  However, it is not only for those who can identify with the message - it brilliantly challenges your assumptions and world view as the best movies tend to do.<br />I cannot watch this film without crying at the ending - you are brought along in caring about the characters so strongly that their love becomes something that matters to you too.<br />Having worn outmore than one copy of the VHS movie, I have desperately waited for its DVD release - and am absolutely thrilled tonight.  I will be pre-ordering it immediately (maybe a couple copies...)<br />This movie may not be wonderful for those who dismiss adultery as immoral without question - but if you are willing to lower the barriers for two hours to at least hear out another side to the story, you will be richly rewarded.  <br />Highly recommended....
B00008EYA5|3.0|I havent seen a very good action packed movie since 48 hours. This one was full of it. If you like army-swat team movies then rent it. The plot is easy and there are a bunch of guns.
B00018D44U|5.0|Norah Jones has one of the most beautiful voices in music these days. I really like the music on her second CD. I like the variety, some jazzy style songs, some country style songs. Norah really shows she is a versatile singer. I think this is why she is so popular right now - her music appeals to many different types of people. This is a really good CD.
B0000509C4|4.0|I was a little scared at first cause the Indian story sort of stunk, but the other two stories were great. If you are a horror movie fan go buy this.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|Its been years since Sarah Mclachlan's last CD... and I'm sure over this time period she has changed and matured just like anyone else would. So I wasn't surprised when this wasn't alot like her previous CD. I still think her vocals are beautiful. And the songs are meaningful, emotional, and very well done. I liked the music very much. I think it is a very enjoyable CD for any Sarah Mclachlan fan.
6305252572|4.0|Yep it is okay, nothing spectacular. I recommend 48 hrs and another 48 hrs.
B000009EUM|5.0|A rare and wonderful album....much darker than the mood set in Hunting High And Low...yet always full of imagery and emotion. &quot;Scoundrel Days&quot;, &quot;Swing of Things&quot;, &quot;October&quot;, &quot;We're looking for the Whales&quot;, &quot; The Weight of the Wind&quot; &quot; Maybe Maybe&quot; and &quot; Soft Rains of April&quot;..not well known A-ha tunes..but full of emotional imagery...though &quot;looking for the whales&quot; and &quot;Maybe Maybe&quot;..take some definite getting used to. Nonetheless..a cool album and wonderful listening.:)
B000001ESP|5.0|As many people have said before, this is Rush's most popular album, and the first one that should be purchased as a new fan. I agree, and this album was the last prog album for Rush for a long time. The best thing about this record is technically it's brilliant and complex, yet it's so accessible, so it's the perfect pick for a new fan looking to get into rush, but it also may be the perfect pick for a fledgling prog fan.
B00004SYWZ|5.0|A-ha is doing their thing and doing it well...relaxing and cool tunes...the kind that u put on program and repeat the whole day...&quot;Minor Earth Major Sky&quot;,&quot;Little Black Heart&quot;,&quot;Summer moved On&quot;,&quot;I Wish I Cared&quot;, &quot;Velvet&quot;,&quot;To Let You Win&quot;,&quot;I Won't forget Her&quot;....stand out as truly excellent...dealing with unrequited love,the loss of love...this is an excellent effort from the trio and definitely worth the buy. Want good music...get this along with all their other efforts...then u will have good music.
B00004Z459|5.0|i love the songs i think that they are so cool, if any one wants to buy this c.d go ahead and buy it i love it. the two songs that i love are runaway and crawling i also love one step closer. actually i love practically all the songs. my friends love it they say it's the bomb
B0000AXE8I|2.0|The Matrix was a 5-star movie, easily, and it stands on its own. This one was a waste. This sequal is just the same packaging, but with nothing inside. The story goes off on tangents that really don't offer anything but pointless clichs. And then, where the story does lead... wow that's stupid. This is not even worth a rental unless you just need to see the leather and sunglasses from a few more angles (that's my second star, still got the cool look).
B000127LW2|1.0|Once upon a time, I used to like Trek. I'm a fan of sci-fi, so it's just natural I guess. But this show really ended that affection once and for all.<br />First, Janeway. She's like a Saturday Night Live parody of a &quot;strong woman&quot; character. Every cliched way of making a character appear strong or smart is taken to laughably absurd levels. She knows more about [insert technobabble here] than someone who has three advanced degrees in [insert technobabble here]. She has this sense of morality - for instance, if there's two ways to get out of a situation, one way is slightly unethical, the other way will almost certainly result in the destruction of the ship and death of the crew, well, she chooses the second way every time. Besides getting incredible boring because this is played out in almost every single episode, it makes for an extremely one-dimensional character. There's never any internal conflict, and without internal conflict you don't have a character, you've just got a sermon. After a few seasons, Janeway became the most self-righteous, sanctimonious character ever portrayed on television. Yet self-righteousness is a pretty pathetic personality trait when all you've got to base it on is some percieved presumption of superiority, aka egomania.  It would have been ever so interesting if anyone on this show had ever questioned anything, but alas, &quot;questioning&quot; would require thought, and that's not done here.<br />As far as the rest of the characters, as is well documented,they didn't even bother to read the scripts. They walked around like cardboard cutouts mouthing lines. The best example of this would have to be the romance between Paris and Torres - I've seen more passion between brothers and sisters in an After School Special. There's just absolutely no heart or soul to this thing.<br />And then there are the plots. Basically there are three of them.<br />1) Voyager blasts the crap out of Borg vessels. Never mind that when Voyager encounters vessels 1/100th as powerful as the Borg, it's a fair fight. So one would think...<br />2) 7 of 9 becomes more human. These are always particularly ironic, for everyone on Voyager acts like Federation Drones; they rarely show any emotion at all. 7 of 9 is really the only one to show emotion, so she's the one who must be taught to be more human. Of course, after god only knows how many of these episodes, she's always back to her original self by the beginning of the next one.<br />3) [insert technobabble here] goes wrong at the beginning of the episode. Everyone walks around looking worried for the next 40 minutes. Then, Torres or 7 of 9 come up with the idea of [insert technobabble here], which saves the day 1 second before the ship is destroyed.<br />Pretty much all plots involve Janeway taking the &quot;moral&quot; choice, which puts the crew in extreme danger, and if they survive the first half of the episode, she redoubles her efforts in the second half. Seriously, this woman couldn't possibly do more to try to kill off her crew. But, viewed in an &quot;After School Special&quot; lesson in simple minded morality sense, I guess it's preachy. Er, I mean educational.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This is movie is great, but very understated. If you read some glowing reviews and then expect it to sweep you off your feet, you might wonder what the fuss was about. I spent the first several minutes wondering if the movie was going to get moving, but then it slowly enveloped me. See it with an open mind, and patience.<br />A lot of people have commented that the Japanese are being mocked and so the film is being racist. As a regular Japan-o-phile myself, I was a little uncomfortable at first, but when the movie started making sense to me, I saw it more as a depiction of the lead characters' mild culture shock than anything else. In other words, we're seeing Tokyo through their eyes, for what it means to them. I think the humor is innocent. And it is hilarious too.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|it's truly magical, leaves you not merely thinking about it but feeling it forever after watching it. it connects with your heart, not just visceral senses like most movies. it tells of a wonder friendship, of the unexplainable connections that people make. it gets to you, and relaxes you, makes you yearn, and makes you smile. it's an experience. this just became my favorite movie
B00005YUPO|3.0|I bought this disc along with the whole Baby Einetein series for my 6 month old, and he still watches it at 2 years. This follows in the tradition of most of the Baby Einstein discs as it is great for kids' skills. Parents will enjoy teaching their kids with these discs. Also the discs offer just the music separately.<br />The only thing I personally dislike strongly about these discs is that Julie Clark puts her kids in to perform rather inanely, and they have little to no value. This disc strikes me the most as it is just about two of her kids playing while you can see them taking direction from someone off-camera. That's all fine and dandy, but I think this disc would have benefitted without her daughters' jokes and canned laughter mixed in.
B0000DCGT0|5.0|When I first saw the previews I knew I had to see the movie. I was not disappointed. In fact it was the greatest movie I had ever seen. Period pieces such as the Great Depression is not an easy thing to capture. The filmakers did an awesome job with this film about a racehorse who may have been smaller than most thoroughbreds but still had a strong heart. Seabiscuit was the shining light during an era of sadness for many. This little horse became a hero in history.<br />Tobey Maguire did a terrific job in the role of Red Pollard who may have been blind in one eye but he still did not let that stop him from competing. When paired with Seabiscuit the two helped each other through their limitations and the two shared a very special bond. Man and horse became not just a team but friends as well. In my mind Maguire should have gotten an Oscar nomination for Best Actor.<br />Jeff Bridges also did a great job as Charles Howard who accepted Pollard's and Seabiscuit's limitations and believed in them. Bridges showed Howard as a compassionate man with a kind heart despite some of the setbacks in his own life.<br />Chris Cooper also did a good job as Tom Smith the horse whispering trainer who was a bit tough but also had a great belief in Seabiscuit. Smith was unconventional when it came to horses. He didn't believe in lives being thrown away and had a gentle way with horses which Cooper seemed to show. <br />Though he wasn't in every seen, Gary Stevens also did a fine job as Pollard's friend and fellow jockey George \\"The Iceman\\" Woolf. For those who don't know, Gary Stevens is a real jockey. In fact a Hall of Fame award winning Jockey. Stevens was probably the only one who really could play Woolf so it was a smart move to have him in the film.<br />Lastly, we get to William H. Macy who played the outlandish, comical radio host \\"Tick-Tock\\" McGlaughlin. Though he was the only character in the movie who was not based on a real person, director Gary Ross definately wrote this with role with Macy in mind and it was a good fit.<br />In my mind, the Oscar for Best Picture should have gone to Seabiscuit and it should have gotten wins in the other categories it was nominated in. Forget Lord Of The Rings: ROTK! Seabiscuit was an even greater movie and a must buy. I bought the DVD and it was money well spent. Definately this was a 5 star film with a great cast, sound, costumes, and all the other ingredients that went into it. It beats all the other films out there by a great many furlongs!
0385504209|1.0|I kept hoping this book would get better as it went on and that was the only reason I kept turning the pages. Brown uses the technique of explaining background to the reader by having the protagonist lecture about his specialty, and boy, does he go on! I felt as though I was listening to a monotonous, late-evening, cable tv, college course. Good thing for this character that the clever granddaughter showed up, who knew her grandfather so well that she could solve the riddles, yet oddly enough, was totally ignorant of the Grail legend.<br />There were four major chase scenes, which became more predictable and sillier as they went on. Sort of like a Bond movie, without the fun or flair. Maybe Brown really wanted to write a screenplay but couldn't pull it off, so turned it into a novel?<br />The subplot of swindling the Vatican seemed mildly interesting but never did make sense. In fact, when the antagonist started to \\"explain all\\", the reasoning got murkier.<br />I think this book - given the great hype around it - was the real swindle.
B000002UAX|5.0|Diverse, clever, rocking, sentimental, moody, uncompromising, brilliant, brilliant and brilliant! It's the Beatles' legendary &quot;White Album&quot; - OF COURSE you should buy it!!!
B000002UA5|5.0|i recently bought this album and listened to the studio version and it didnt really do much for me, but i kept it anyway.  it wasnt that it was bad, it was just that was... almost too much abstract percussian work.  i later put the live cd in, and all i can say is AWSOME!  \\"Careful with that Axe Eugene\\" is my favorite, with a psychadelic egyptian-sounding tune, before someone in a soft spooky voice goes 'careful with that axe eugene' and then starts a whole screaming sequence that i just awsome before some unbelievable guitar playing!  this is long before kurt cobain or maralyn mason pulling something like that off. this is some pretty funky stuff! as for the album, i like the studio recording the more i listen to it, but its worth it just for the live album!  o yea, it even includes a poster!
B00006AG5N|5.0|The inlay card of this CD states &quot;Before anyone did anything, Elvis did everything.&quot; As true as that may be in many cases, the idea to compile number one hits from both sides of the Atlantic is one clearly borrowed from the Beatles' hugely successful &quot;1&quot; album two years before. However, very few artists can boast the ability to produce a suitably sized compilation album based entirely on number one singles achieved in both the U.K. and the U.S. In fact, perhaps only Mariah Carey, Madonna, Michael Jackson, The Beatles and Elvis Presley are capable of such a feat.<br />Countless compilations of Elvis Presley's music have been released in almost three decades since his death, and for Elvis to be brought to the attention of a 21st Century audience, this compilation needed to present something new and different to attract the interest of not only a modern generation but loyal fans alike. And what could have been better than the inclusion of what could almost be said to be a \\"brand new\\" Elvis song - the single \\"A Little Less Conversation\\" which stormed to the top of the UK charts in the summer of 2002 and stayed there for 4 consecutive weeks, breaking all kinds of UK chart records in the process. The song was written for inclusion in the Elvis movie, \\"Live A Little, Love A Little\\" and originally recorded for an unshot segment of the 1968 NBC television \\"Comeback\\" special. 34 years later, a Dutch DJ named JXL remixed this infectious song and it's appearance in a Nike TV advertising commercial during the Soccer World Cup Tournament only helped seal the song as an instant hit. It's as if the modern era of music has come full-circle with this song - music certainly wouldn't be quite the same today had it not started from the path Elvis created, and now here's Elvis \\"mingled\\" for lack of a better word with the sound of today's music.<br />To be honest, I bought this CD on the strength of wanting to own that one Elvis song that I didn't have amongst my collection, but to my surprise I found it was not the only thing new and different about this CD. The songs have been digitally remastered and sound staggeringly clear and fresh, making it even more difficult to believe that some of Elvis's earliest hits are now almost half a century old. There's also a different version of \\"The Wonder Of You\\" with arguably a slightly better vocal performance than the original but with a weak applause from the audience at the end that hardly gives credit to the great live performance given here by Elvis and his band. Throughout his entire career, Elvis never failed to give anything but a great performance in the recording studio, giving 110% so effortlessly while creating timeless classics.<br /><br />Precisionists may question the inclusion (and exclusion) of some of the songs on this CD. Judging by the majority of songs on this CD, the basis for including a song as a &quot;number one&quot; would appear to be on the single reaching number one on the official U.S. Billboard chart and/or the official U.K. record retailer chart.  If that is the case, &quot;I Want You, I Need You, I Love You&quot; should be here as it was Elvis's second number one on the official U.S. Billboard chart. &quot;Burning Love&quot; made it to number one only on the U.S. Cashbox chart, and &quot;In The Ghetto&quot; reached the top spot on the U.K.'s NME chart only, a chart that ceased to be used as the official chart almost a decade earlier. Then there's the exclusion of all the &quot;flip&quot; sides to some of the songs listed as double-A side singles.<br />All in all, this CD is worth every penny. The king of rock `n' roll never sounded better on disc and  these songs will always be the musical \\"launchpad\\" from which other singers, songwriters and musicians followed.lection, but to my surprise I found it was not the only thing new and different about this CD.

B0000DCGT0|4.0|Three men and a horse, all born with incredible talent and Heart, (with a capital &quot;H&quot;), and all hit by life's hard knocks, prove that indomitable spirit can overcome crippling odds. Real winners may just be losers in disguise, looking for the opportunity to overcome adversity and show their true colors.<br />This actual story of the race horse Seabiscuit and his owner, trainer, and jockey is set against the background of the Great Depression. It is the ultimate feel-good movie. Film writer-director Gary Ross effectively portrays how the actual Seabiscuit and his saga had a galvanizing effect on America's &quot;everyman,&quot; hit hard by hard times, as the down-and-out racehorse became the hopeful parable for their lives. Many of the film's scenes are juxtaposed with black and white still shots taken during the depression era, beautifully illustrating the period, and the tone of the characters. The use of a narrator also lends an air of documentary authenticity to many of the newsreel-like sequences.<br />The cast is excellent. Toby Maguire shines, as usual, in his role as the bruised but not beaten jockey &quot;Red&quot; Pollard. Tom Smith is wonderful as Seabiscuit's enigmatic horse trainer. Mr. Smith's lines may be few but he lends an extraordinary presence to the role and the movie. Wealthy and successful businessman Charles Howard, played by Jeff Bridges, is a man with vision who pulled himself up by his bootstraps only to be thrown by personal tragedy. He bought a loosing horse on the word of a down-and-out trainer and hired a half blind jockey to race him. These characters become inextricably bound as, together, they undergo the journey of a lifetime. William H. Macy, as the fast talkin' radio tipster, and his blonde female sidekick, are show stealers.<br />Seabiscuit somehow manages to avoid lapses into corniness, and against all odds, an equestrian film about an undersized, bad-tempered horse goes for the money and competes successfully with some of the years best films. Highly recommended!<br />JANAof the years best films. Highly recommended!<br />JANA
B00004WEJZ|2.0|I have no idea why they even spent the money to shoot this film.  Sean Connery is a great actor, but he was too old for this role.  It's a forgettable remake of Thunderball (which was a good movie) that had me falling asleep.  James Bond doesn't have grey hair.  The older Sean Connery movies were the best, but you should pass this one up.
B00006JDS4|2.0|It was 6 years ago and i had finally purchased my first DVD player for 250 dollars. Pretty good bargain back then. I was staying with my Pops back then and he had brought home his first DVD purchase, It was \\"I spit on your Grave\\". Imagine my chagrin. \\"Its got a hot chick on the cover with a knife\\" he said. Then we sat down and watched one of the most horrific Rape and Murder movies ever. First the acting is atrocious, the story is so silly and the Director really got his jollies off of overextending the softcore rape scenes that were more laughable then horrific. Not that rape is in anyway laughable but if you plan on tackling a serious subject then have some class. If you want to see a brutal and TOTALLY realistic Rape and revenge flick then track down the French film \\"Irrversible\\". Now that film will make you squirm, cry, scream or a combination of all three. Just stay far away from this trash unless of course silly violent sex flicks are your cup of tea. If so, watch away!
0156027321|5.0|I almost skipped this extraordinary book because the premise was so hard to imagine.  A tiger in a life boat?  The story unfolds naturally once begun and flows with the magic of a tale well told.   Pi's problem solving skills start with his name, continue through his taming skills,  and extend beyond an astonishing will to live.  Having little expectation, this book was a great surprise.
0375404635|3.0|Well first, lets cut to the chase, the book is not as bad as a three star, but not worthy of a four star either. I'd give it a passing grade of 72%. I don't regret reading it and actually found it more and more intriguing as days passed since I finished reading it.<br />The writing style is rough. I don't want to be to critical here as it was Plath's first novel, and when I finish my first, the same may be said of mine. Sometimes the writing is brilliant, sometimes it is cumbersome, but all in all it should not affect the reader too much.<br />Overall, not a great read, but not regrettable. A female version of Catcher In the Rye it is not, but I can see that the 20-something female reader may enjoy it more than any other demograph, identifying with Esther better. After all, we all have been there to some degree and some point in our lives. It is valuable to see how far the mental health care field has progressed since the middle of the 20th century and today. We should all be grateful.<br />For more details, go to aj.huff.org. Thanks.
0385504209|5.0|i really enjoyed the da vinci code. it really makes one reflect on hidden meanings, and &quot;what lies beneath.&quot; although there were a few controvercial ideas, i would just like to say to all of the people out there who are having hissy fits over this book: dan brown did not write this book and say &quot;these are the facts, this is true.&quot; he simply did a lot of research and developed a wonderful conspiracy theory on the work of da vinci. he never claimed that it was all true. though most of his research is based on facts that he foud, the conclusions he drew from it are not necesarilily concrete and he NEVER claimed that they were. i would encourage all of the people out there to calm down, and realize that it is a well written book, you might not think it's true, but he's not saying it is. it is a fictional book based on extensive research. dan brown is not trying to undermine the Christain religion, i myself am a fervent Christian and i simply read the book with an open mind, enjoyed it beyond belief and placed it on my permanent list of best books i have ever read, and moved on. i suggest u do the same. u are taking a stance against somthing that never claimed to be true. do somthing better with ur time, and enjoy this wonderful book, i gurentee u won't regret it.
B00005ATQD|5.0|Whether you are in a relationship or not, and whether or not you dig Kubrick's works, this is an interesting movie to watch. Even if others tell you that the director goes berserk with some scenes (and one could say he does, for e.g., a vivid masked orgy in a posh mansion with Gregorian chants in the background), and even if you are otherwise accustomed to the cut-crazy NYPD Blue type of rush modern cinematography, which is diametrically opposed to the ethereally unfolding cinema of Kubrick, there is something very deeply moving about the nuances of this movie's identifiable characters on the verge of marital collapse.<br />The film is actually inspired by the 1926 novel \\"Traumnovelle\\" by Arthur Schnitzler, which was based in the decadent Vienna of the 1920's (sidenote: highly recommended book, now sold under the label of \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" right here on Amazon). Of course Kubrick's version is based instead in modern Manhattan and studies the life of a well-to-do couple (Kidman, Cruise).<br />The story unfolds with all the smooth pizzazz of almost any Kubrick venture, effortlessly going from domestic discord to sexual obsession to murder mystery. Cruise, playing a doctor with all the right connections and a very good lifestyle, is convinced that his wife is deeply loyal to him. Until one day she confesses how she had once contemplated having an affair with a naval officer whom she had only glimpsed across a hotel lobby. This confession comes after an upscale party where they both found themselves in the hands of lustful but unsuccessful seducers. The roots of his faith shaken, Cruise examines his own lusts. After an unconsummated dalliance with a Greenwich Village prostitute, he eventually finds himself in an ominous mansion where wealthy masked participants indulge in dark ritual orgies, and perhaps even murder. But in a world where faithfulness is revealed to be little more than an illusion, can evil be any more substantive?<br />There is really very little that can be said about the movie's weaknesses. Perhaps the orgy ritual may come across to some as a little baffling but I believe it very stunningly symbolizes our inherent instincts for philandaring. That the unrueful participants should feel necessary to don masks and hide their identity while doing their deeds only underscores their haplessness in the face of their desires.<br />The movie will keep you on your toes, and just when you think you have figured it out you will be presented with something uncanny. The denouement, in fact the very last word before the final credits roll, is a strikingly apt summary of almost all marital relationships.<br />Come to think of it, the whole movie sports dialog that is sharp and crisp, one of the reasons I watch movies more than once, which makes this DVD a very worthy purchase. Highly recommended.be said about the movie's weaknesses.

That the unrueful participants should feel necessary to don masks and hide their identity while doing their deeds only underscores their haplessness in the face of their desires.<br />The movie will keep you on your toes, and just when you think you have figured it out you will be presented with something uncanny. The denouement, in fact the very last word before the final credits roll, is a strikingly apt summary of almost all marital relationships.<br />Come to think of it, the whole movie sports dialog that is sharp and crisp, one of the reasons I watch movies more than once, which makes this DVD a very worthy purchase. Highly recommended.
B000089RVX|4.0|Wow, I can't believe this album was released just over a year ago.  And I just bought this the other day!  So what finally made me go out and buy it?  Well, watching MTV the other day, the video for &quot;My Immortal&quot; started playing.  I was taken in by Amy Lee's beautiful vocals along with the piano and strings and, of course, the heavy guitars which come in later.  Anyways, I'll cut to the chase.  Evanescence are a band that have shown tremendous maturity for a debut album!  Amy's beautiful vocals and the rest of the band's superb musicianship definitely come through.  Some might say that their music comes in as being way too melodramatic.  Personally, I don't think so.  The combination of angelic vocals, heavy guitars, strings, and synthesizers is just balanced and perfect without going overboard.  Again, I just can't believe that I just got this album the other day.  If you haven't bought your copy, I suggest you go out and buy one NOW!
B000001Y5X|5.0|Portrait of an American Family is one of the best albums of the 90's. All thirteen tracks are geniously put together and pulled off perfectly. This was when Manson was still having fun with his music, before he was rich or famous. Many of the songs contain samples and he was fond of using allusions to other works. Mostly from the hit TV show of the early 90's, Twin Peaks. <br />The album was also produced by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, and he actually played guitar in some of the songs. Every song has amazing replay value... and get very catchy.<br />If you like Nine Inch Nails or ANY of Manson's later works, check this album out.
B00006RCNW|5.0|The acting is great.  The camera work is great.  The editing is great.  The directing is great.  What else is there to say?  Oh, forgot the story.  The story is better than great, if that's possible.  This show will hold your attention every step of the way.  It crosses some lines in graphic content, but try reading the newsaper and finding something less graphic.  When you're used to black and white, there's a refreshing beauty to the grey you'll find in every one of the character in The Shield.  I won't ruin it for you by saying more except to say 'If you enjoy police thrillers, you'll love it.  If you don't, what are you reading this for?'
B00005JMFI|5.0|This movie was absolutley hilarious.  I laughed so hard at Buddy the elf in the theatre and will do it again at home if it ever comes out on DVD.  Definitely, Will Ferrell at his best--buy this movie!
0312263120|3.0|After having read &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; and &quot;Angels &amp; Demons&quot; I was ready to attempt to crack another mystery thriller by Dan Brown. The previous books were a challenge to solve but &quot;Digital Fortress&quot; did not measure up. The basic plot of a super computer &quot;code breaker&quot; gone mad was interesting but it was evident within the first 75 pages that the mystery was going to be easily solved. The charcters were given highly educated credentials but didn't seem very brilliant when it came to solving fairly obvious clues. This was very evident in the last part of the book when the computer printed out the &quot;Ceasar's Box&quot; algorithm. A room full of scientists and UBER computers geeks took forever to come up with the simple answer &quot;3&quot;.<BR>Perhaps because this was Dan Brown's first book and he hadn't mastered the skill he showed in &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; and &quot;Angels and Demons&quot; that I wasn't overly impressed with this effort. If you've read other books by him you'll quickly see that he follows a similar formula for each of his books. While this book wasn't bad, it doesn't come close to his later work. If this is your first Dan Brown book you'll probably enjoy the read but if you've read his other books first, you might end up a little disappointed.

0385504209|1.0|This book is a book that every catholic should read, scrutinize and analyze down to the last syllable NOT b/c it is a great book but b/c the blatant inaccuracies/misrepresentations that exist throughout the book which are so bluntly aimed at denegrating the teachings of the Church and of Christ. Every Catholic should be INFORMED (and this book DEPENDS on the reader NOT being informed)of the true history, tradition and teachings of the church, and this book is an excellent book to help point out some of the aspects that Catholics SHOULD be informed about. The book's misinformation and misrepresentation of various teachings of the church to the author's own end, including those about the important role of women (which obviously were not in his interest or in the interest of others to admit), the author appears to be totally obsessed (and that is the ONLY word that can be used) with female worship. The book was described by the New York Times as a thriller which does not say much about the correspondent's level of reading. For a thriller it is poor. You know who killed who from the Chapter 1. The rest of the story is not thrilling at all..... you know everything  that is going to happen. you can predict it. It is just a graphic discharge of spite towards the catholic church including Opus Dei. Of course, had the murderer been exposed at the end there would have been NO space for the author to express all his distorted feelings towards the catholic church. Furthermore it is interesting how EVERY person with any form of faith and dedication to the catholic church is portrayed as evil.<br />The lack of knowledge of the author is explicit.e.g. In the description of the Madonna of the Rocks - He wrongly calls St. John the Baptist Jesus and vice versa. If he has any doubts of who J. the Baptist is he should look up most of the art c1500-1600 where he is always portrayed with a long stick and a cross at the top. The \\"John the Baptist\\" painting by Da Vinci himself shows him like so. When I showed the actual painting to people and read how the author describes it, proved to be excellent humor. The interpretation of the Last supper is likewise absurd. Christ and John (who the author calls Mary) would have had to have VERY wide hips in order to be touching as described.<br />One piece of advice to the author, In presuming such authority you have only revealed YOUR GROSS ignorance of many aspects covered by the book.... Before you write, BE informed and make sure that your references ARE credible. The intelligence of an author can be discerned by his/her capacity not only to use the material he/she has available that agrees with his agenda, but his/her capacity to analyze critically every aspect of his/her data be it for or against and to present it in a balance manner to make the reader think - which this book certainly does not.ike so.

0671027387|5.0|I thought this was a fantastic book.  The Da Vinci Code has gotten major hype and I loved it, but this book could be better.  It takes a little longer to really get in to it, but it then grabs you and does not let go.  I found myself smiling and cheering after numerous plot turns, it truly is a thriller in every sense of the word.  This book will keep you guessing and keep you pleading for Dan Brown to release his next book.
B00005V1Y0|4.0|It's impossible not to be moved by this wonderful gem of a movie, which proved to be a major stepping stone for bigger (but not always better) works for its director.  The ultimate &quot;feel good&quot; story which works on so many levels...colorful, talented cast, excellent soundtrack and choreography, charming writing and witty, inspired direction &amp; cinematography.<br />The only reason this DVD doesn't rate a perfect score is its unfortunate lack of special features.  Letterbox format would  be nice and some kind of commentary or other related bonus material should have been included.
1402555989|5.0|Mark Haddon has written a delightfully engaging novel that catches you from the very beginning and slowly pulls you into the odd experience of it's autistic narrator as he endeavors to be a &quot;detective&quot; and discover who killed his neighbor's dog. Along the way he learns the truth about his mother's death and the odd way a father's love can sometimes express itself.<br />Never schlocky or succumbing to sentimentality, THE CURIOUS INCIDENT is funny, touching, and challenging. The audio edition is one of the best audiobooks I've listened to in recent past. Jeff Woodman's performance enhances the story throughout the narrative.<br />Don't be surprised if you find yourself driving out of your way just so you can keep listening.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|First of all I'd like to thank Amazon for not playing only the first 30 seconds of the samples because the best part of any particular piece may not be at the beginning. I have not seen the movie (don't care for the anti-American Depp at all), and bought the CD soley on the samples &quot;The Black Pearl&quot; and &quot;The Medallion Calls.&quot;<br />Due to &quot;The Time Machine&quot; I have become a major Klaus Badelt fan. I know some of the pieces sound like &quot;Gladiator&quot;, but what soundtrack addict could get enough of that score? And being a woman, I just LOVE the sheer masculinity that Badelt and Zimmer pump into their scores. Not the wimpy, psuedo-tough masculinity that seems to pervade most movies nowadays, but they really convey courage, confidence, stength and virtue. Badelt also utilizes the most LUSH orchestrations imaginable. If he lived in the 17 or 18th centuries, he would be a major classical composer. I am going back to find other scores of his I overlooked. Williams and Horner among others seem to be drifting out of the limelight and I am always on the lookout for brilliant new composers. Thank you, Mr. Badelt, for yet another original and startingly beautiful score! If you love strong, intense, gorgeously orchestrated music, this one's for you.
B00006JIA4|4.0|Arguably, we often look at so many performers in this music industry, we seem to forget so many times, artists that have been influential in this past century. Especially, now that it is all about manufactured wannabes that want to make it to the top, and manufactured phonies like Britney Spears, and our Milli Vanilli, Jennifer Lopez. Yet, it is the ultimate tragedy in the music industry, when so many acts are just dying, because we don't play and reflect inspirations and influences from then. That comes with so many acts in the music industry, especially Queen. Yet, the group has faced a whole amount of tragedy years ago, with the death of Freddie Mercury. Still, their music has conjured into so many different categories: Rock, Opera, Dance, Soul, New Wave, Pop, and Musical. Roger Taylor, John Deacon, Brian May, and the late Freddie Mercury have ultimately set the standards of what the music industry has missed for years.<br />The Platinum Collection, is a combination Box Set of all three of Queen's three Greatest Hits records. There are just so many songs that still seem to reflect what Queen conjured that are still declared as some of the greatest of our 20th Century era. The first disc reflects on Queen during their classic 70's era. This really includes some of the greatest songs ever, including Crazy Little Thing Called Love, Another One Bites The Dust, and the classic Rock Sports Anthems, We Are The Champions and We Will Rock You. The first disc also includes great songs including Bicycle Race, and the untimely Bohemian Rhapsody, which was a number one hit here, twice.<br />The second disc, reflects on Queen's other experimental era overseas. Although their feel was lost abruptly in the U.S. during the 80's, they still maintained steam with their records in Europe. The songs here are reflected upon their feel overseas, til the dramatic death of Freddie Mercury, whom died of AIDS in 1991. The songs really reflect into so many feels here, including Under Pressure, their big duet with David Bowie, and other great songs like the operatic, Innuendo, the great classics Radio Ga Ga, and the dramatic Power anthem, The Show Must Go On, the final released songs before Freddie's death in 1991. Although other songs were released in the process including The Invisible Man, and the operatic Innuendo. Ultimately, overseas Queen was still on a roll until the very end.<br />The third album, is a unfortunate problem, largely because some of the songs were recorded with other people, and not reflecting Queen's success with the departed Freddie Mercury. The songs include live performances including Somebody To Love with George Michael, recorded live during the concert tribute for Freddie Mercury. Still, Queen had a good touch with other collaborations and remakes including another great remake of The Show Must Go On with Elton John. Elton performed the song before on tour in 1992, in memory of Freddie Mercury. The third disc also includes some solo recordings including The Great Pretender and Driven By You, which Freddie and Brian each did as a pair of solo efforts. The other downside is the remake of Another One Bites The Dust, with Wyclef Jean of The Fugees fame, which really falls flat on the face. Still, the record is a classic for any die hard Queen fan, but not for the newcomer.<br />Although with not just this collection, many people may not want this collection, in favor of The Gold Collection by Queen, which only has the first two discs. Even though this collection is an updated version, but the songs are just timeless. I really suggest that you buy this one, for any die hard Queen fan, but also if you don't have any of Queen's music on CD.

B00005JMJ4|1.0|There's nothing like a great artsy movie.  This is nothing like a great artsy movie.  The only good things about it are merely coincidental.  Although it's nice to see good scenery and hear a Japanese kareoke version of \\"God Save The Queen\\" (Sex Pistols version, mind you), nothing else that blocks the camera here is worthy of my time.  The performances everyone talks about...simply aren't there.  Bill Murray's worst performance EVER...he doesn't laugh, doesn't cry, doesn't even alter his facial expression the ENTIRE MOVIE!  Scarlet Johansen (or however you spell it) doesn't do much more.<br />There is NO plot.<br />The jokes aren't funny.<br />Every line is monotone.<br />And frankly, I could have gone the rest of my life without seeing those gargantuan Japanese strippers.
B0000UHFC6|2.0|Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the music.  It's some of the most moving music ever composed for film.  My beef is with this &quot;Limited Edition&quot; soundtrack, and that complaint is the &quot;limited&quot; part.  Although the soundtrack for FotR suffered from cut-and-paste it at least managed to play in film order.  This one felt like the editor chose the tracks and order by tossing a dart at a list of the different pieces.  And here is also the biggest flaw: Two of the BEST musical cues from the film have been cut from this soundtrack: The chorale variation of the main Fellowship Theme from the Battle of the Morannon is gone entirety, as is most of the Charge of the Rohirrim.<br />Maybe I'm being harsh, but just how much was left out, and the jumbled order, deeply disappointed me.  I only hope that when the Extended Edition of Return of the King is released this entire 12+ hour symphony, in proper film order, follows it.
B000060MMI|5.0|I basically was surfing a heavy metal website called Sleaze Roxx one night. When I saw reading a bio that Dave King was singing vocals in a band called Flogging Molly. I purchased both Swagger and Drunken Lullabies the same day based on that. Loved his Katmandu and Fastway releases and well worth it for any fan too check out. Another great release and just like Wine they get better with age. Great disc to put in the CD player, sit back with a cold Miller High Life and enjoy after a hard day at work.
0345363132|5.0|This is a wonderful book.  It is historically accurate, following Kendall's &quot;Richard III&quot;, but also flows.  Characters are well developed, and one finds oneself caring what happens to them.  One especially cares about Anne and Richard, and Richard's final end is truly a tragedy.<BR>  This is a very, very long novel.  But, that is not a disadvantage.  One hates to have it end.<BR>  The biggest plus in this book for me was that it made the War of the Roses much more understandable.  I already believed that Richard III did not murder the princes in the tower.  Actually, I think Penman's solution makes more sense than Josephine Tey's solution.<BR>  I highly recommend this book.
B00018D3RI|5.0|Although the upcoming movie will likely be entertaining, I prefer to go for the real deal. I've already viewed several episodes from the 1st season box set, and after 29 years, still recall most of these episodes, only because it was such a stand up series. In my opinion no other two actors blended as well as David Soul and Paul Michael Glaser, and between 1975 - 1979 they managed to mould a very unique television series, containing action, romance, drama, and even comedic moments. If you were too young to recall it, my advice is to purchase it, for the price its well worth every penny. A lot of extras with the DVD release, very nicely put together. It would be great to see these two together again. I encourage everyone to read David Souls letter on the interest of doing a film that presents a closure to this original superb series. I don't understand why they have never been approached? Get with it producers, because with the new movie and DVD release of the series, now is the time! <br />Go To: [...] (for David Souls letter)
B00009V7P8|5.0|I loved the Damien Rice songs that were being played on the radio, so I decided to check out the entire album. At first (and I mean in the first minute only) I wanted to skip to the songs I knew. But I didn't and I am so glad. The songs caught me.  They're melodic and most are subdued in nature, however they're still dynamic. Beyond that, I find several of them enchanting.  Rice takes many chances (especially for a debut album) and I was surprised and impressed with them instead of being put off. They aren't your ordinary run-of-the-mill songs. Rice explores the music and treats it as an entire experience. You'd think he'd been doing this for years! It's very easy to listen to and I haven't stopped yet!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I think that this movie is one of the biggest rip offs, I have seen in a long time. Unfortunately, I never read the customer reviews before I rented this movie. <BR>Thank goodness, I didn't pay $7.00 to see it at a theater.How was this ever nominated for an Emmy????(Nepotism at its highest) I would have turned the film off, only I kept waiting for something to make sense and live up to the movie reviews I had read in our local paper. I guess this movie was made on P. T. Barnum's assertion! What a bomb!!

B000003TA4|4.0|The most poppy and mainstream of nirvana albums,culminating in influence from some of the best alt-rock at the time(i.e the pixies) with beatlesesque pop hooks,and raw and honest lyrics and vocal delivery, make this album an undeniable rock classic.<BR>Each track itself is a classic,the music itself,without any of the nirvana/kurt cobain story attached,can stand as some of the best rock music ever.
B00018D44U|4.0|I love this CD. Though most of the songs are the same and you can't tell when a song ends and a new song begins, this CD has catchy rythyms and it is great for the car, because it is not too boring(like classical-which will put you to sleep) and it's not so upbeat that you can't hear yourself think! The best songs on this CD are Sunrise(the first song), What am I to you? (my favorite song, which is #2 on the CD), and Those Sweet Words(#3). Norah Jones is the best songer in years! You should definatley buy this CD!!!

Mr. Banned and censored, get your facts straight. theres a reason a little magazine you might have heard of called &quot;rollingstone&quot; put 5 beatles albums in the top 14 of their 500 greatest albums list and its not because the beatles are &quot;overrated&quot;. if anything theyre underrated. yea, you heard me, underrated. im not saying you have to like the beatles or led zeppelin or pink floyd or bob dylan, you dont even have to listen to them. listen to your precious duran duran. write your false reviews. just dont criticize the greatest artists to ever live because they dont have a song you can dance to.

B000067J1Q|3.0|No doubt this is an All Time classical picture that deserve a 5 star rating. Why I rated it 3 stars? You see, I live in Mexico City and bought the DVD version to show it to the family and friends thru a home theater system to enhance the music and enjoy the 4.1 surround system. Before ordering the DVD I checked that it included subtitles in spanish so that all people that saw the picture could understand it completely. Oh big dissapointing I had. The beautiful Hammerstein's lyrics did not came translated and no spanish subtitles appeared when the songs are performed. Only two or three songs appeared translated to spanish in the subtitles. I wonder what type of genius in Fox Pictures decided not to show the spanish subtitles in most of the songs. I have the video version in english language and of course all the songs are shown translated in the subtitles so we can appreciate the great lyrics that remain great in spanish. I also bought the South Pacific DVD version and it have all the songs translated to spanish thru the subtitles. Someone know if it exists a widescreen, single disc version that include spanish subtitles with all songs translated to spanish? I would appreciate any answer.<BR>Thank you<BR>eceballosm@yahoo.com.mx
B00003CXC7|5.0|This film was always one of Hitchcock's finest.  There is nothing I could add to what has been said before in praise.<br />However, I question why the film was letterboxed when the original movie was shot with a ratio of 1.33:1 (or 4:3).  Paramount Pictures, in 1954, had not released anything in Vista Vision, their wide screen answer to Cinemascope. &quot;White Christmas&quot; would be the first to be released later that year in the new process.<br />After comparing the new DVD to my 1984 VHS tape, I noticed some striking discrepancies.  The most obvious were the shots when James Stewart looked through his camera viewfinder.  What he, and we, saw was a complete circle, with the image contained within the circle.  On the DVD, this circle is cropped at the top and bottom.  Why?<br />Also, during the DVD documentary on how the film was restored, a technician is seen holding the actual film.  It plainly shows the movie was shot in the common ratio of 1.33:1.  When before and after comparisons are shown, one can clearly see extra image at the top and bottom of the before shot.  Again, why letterbox?<br />For such a great film, my criticisms may seem of low importance.  I would just rather not see cropping like this happen to other restorations of great classics in the future.

B000063DFN|5.0|Well, as most of you peeps already know, this is one of their best! So let's not waste any time go through the tracks now:<br />Aces High: first of two hit singles on the album. An awesome album opener... great guitars, great vocals!  A<br />2 Minutes to Midnight: second hit single. This would be my favorite song off the album... that is if rest of the album sucked... that's not the case here however!  A<br />Losfer Words ( Big Orra): I'm a big fan of instrumentals, and this is one of the best! It reminds me of music from classic NES games like CastleVania and (especially) Gradius. Perfect in every way!  A+<br />Flash of the Blade: This song is said to be connected to the next one as part of a saga... Another brilliant intro; great use of the hammer-ons and pull-offs!! I love the chorus in this one!  A+<br />The Duellists: Part two of the saga... not quite as good as Flash, but still amazing. Nice instrumental break.  A<br />Back in the Village: The black sheep of the album, but still a great track... I think of it as a sequal to The Prisoner (from Number of the Beast)  B<br />Powerslave: Best song on the album just so happens to be the title track. Everything is perfect; Bruce wrote ( and sang... of course) some amazing lyrics, Adrian and Dave deliver the goods as always, but it's Steve and Nicko who shine the most on this song... especially during the instrumental break!  A++<br />Rime of the Ancient Mariner: the 13 minute+ epic! A favorite among many a Powerslave owner, and for good reason! There's more time changes in this song for you to shake a stick at, and a great song to sing along with. UP THE IRONS  A+<br />BTW... this is my first time reviewing an album, so if my review sucked... I don't care!
0385504209|1.0|A nice story idea, but so so badly executed.  He tries to create a sense of high drama by resorting to hyperbole.  His characters swing from sullen, to grinning, to suspicious to astounded over basically nothing, all within the same two sentences.  Over and over again.  This is a new low.  The worst book I've ever read.
B0000C7PRY|4.0|That's the best way for me to put it. Since I wasn't expecting Spock's Beard, and I like Neal Morse's other solo work, I got the set and found I liked it lot.  It's for the most part better than his previous solo efforts, especially in terms of production.  Quite a number of prog elements remain, yet I would not call it a prog album.<br />In 'Testimony,' Neal brought in some impressive studio talent, but they seemed to be there to contribute their talent only, and not much creative input. Well after all, it is a solo album. This work is nothing like either Spock's Beard or Transatlantic.<br />Neal alone delivered enough creativity to carry my interest throughout both discs.  His production and musical skills are phenomenal, but at the same time it didn't have any melodies that lingered in my brain either. Nothing really screamed out to leave on 'repeat' in my CD player.  I found myself pulling out 'Testimony' and putting Transatlantic in for comparison after the first hearing. As other reviewers have noted, I have to agree Neal's talents shine much brighter when he collaborates with other talented musicians and they are directly contributing to the direction of his work.  <br />When compared to Neal's previous solo efforts, 'Testimony' has a lot more depth and variety. It is much more personal, not just lyrically, but musically.  It's sometimes lush and simple - ballads and light themes. Other times it's varied - interludes of frenetic prog syncopation, orchestral interludes, and Latin rhythms.<br />Neal's vocals are in top form, although I do miss hearing his Lennon-ish style (Example: 'Fourth of July' on 'Snow'). Here it's a straight-forward and personal vocal style, with most vestiges of showmanship gone.<br />It's a fairly engaging work. If you appreciate Neal's other solo CDs, you will likely be impressed with many of these tracks. I get the impression though that some of the music was more of an afterthought to fit the lyric, rather than both being written together.  Notable exceptions were the &quot;Land of Beginning Again&quot; and &quot;God's Theme 1 &amp; 2.&quot; I found the compositional structure on these to be better than average. Neal is capable of much better from a music-composition standpoint. I thought the three 'Overtures' were interesting compositionally, but beyond them it was hard to get excited.<br />Most artists tend to do better within the single disc format.<br />Still, it's a respectable double disc set, with not too much filler. <br />Pick it up if you like Neal's solo work.
B00018TI5E|5.0|I have listened to about 5 songs off this album in snippets in the last 10 minutes, and I find myself going back to each one and replaying it. Indeed I have just this minute ordered a copy of this on the net. It sounds utterly sublime; beautiful melody, amazing guitar-work (as always) and simply amazing songs. If you haven't heard any of it I suggest giving some a listen; this is music as art. Beautiful
0151008116|5.0|Yann Martel's Life of Pi is a wondrous, marvelous novel. There is much to wonder and marvel at in this wonderful book. The story is simple, yet complex at the same time and can be read on many levels. On the surface, this is the story of a young man who grows up in India and at sixteen, en route to Canada with his family, finds himself the sole survivor of a shipwreck, afloat on a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger. The story is divided into two sections. The first parts centers on the boy's life as a young zookeeper's son. As a boy, he decides to become a practicing Catholic, Muslim and Hindu, all at once. His ruminations on zoo keeping and religion lay the groundwork for his strength to want to survive on a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger. Beyond the story, however, is an examination of religion and of how to write about the religious experience. It is an examination on the strengths (and weaknesses) of religious belief. I had a difficult time getting into this novel at first, but the progression of the story compelled me to finish it. I'm glad I did. The novel ends with a philosophical bang, which I won't spoil for the readers. Martel impressed me with the wonderful and flooring ending. Life of Pi is not a typical novel. It is a unique, compelling, enchanting reading experience. I highly recommend it...
B000002MFN|5.0|This album is probably one of Madonna's best work. Take it for me I'm 16 and I played it to my teenage friends and they just loved it. This album had great melodic rythyms. To synthezized blues, to urban hip-hop, to disco, then to jazzy tune. Erotica the title track had great lyrics and rythym. The scratchy surface noise made sound like a record was being played, there is also an indian chant in the background later in the song. Her voice in this song sounded hypnotizing, especially when she sounds like she is having an orgasim, and straight to the point. Fever, a classic song, has a great rythym; with pulsating beats and a jazzy background. Bye, Bye, Baby , which is one of my faves, has a hip-hop rythym, and she makes her voice sound like Kylie Minogue. Deeper and Deeper has a great disco beat. The lyrics in this song are wonderful. In this song she expresses her love to a lover (I can't keep from falling in love with you). Where Life Begins, Bad Girl, and waiting sound like jazzy blue songs, which are absoultley beautiful. Words and Rain are synthezied blues songs that have solace volcals and divine rythyms. Why's it so Hare and In This Life are two songs about AIDS and homosexuality. They both have great beats and vocals. The rap version of the song Waiting, which is called Did You Do It? could have been taken out of the album, still it is a plus. The last song Secret Garden is probably the most jazzy song in the album, eventhough I don't know what the song is about it sound amazing. It is too bad that this album was overlooked because of the title track, it probably would have reached #1. Any person that is barely getting into Madonna should have this album. This album has her greatest work ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So go buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I don't care how many good things I've heard about this movie. It had like three funny parts (hello!, it was supposed to be a comedy). I heard it was a great movie, so I rented it. It was horrible, I hated it an awful lot. Lost In Translation was very boring, the directing may have been pretty good, and I didn't mind Scarlette Johanson so much, but still thought it was really boring. However, I like that Giovanni Ribsi was a member of the cast, he's a good actor and I don't see much of him. You're also probably thinking if I didn't like it, why am I taking time to review it, well I thought I'd just let everyone know it was bad, before they wasted money.
0151008116|4.0|I picked up this book becaues friends have been recommending it to me for quite some time. It is a funny read with some interesting parts. I liked the tiger the best. Overall a decent read.
B000063DHL|5.0|When I first bought this album, I only knew Wasted Years... little did I know it would become my favorite Maiden album and one of my all-time favorites!<br />Caught Somewhere in Time: The best album opener ever! This song just hypnotises you with it's epic-like intro, speedy pace, pre-chorus riffs, etc.... I also want to point out that the production ( on the whole album, but especually this song) is just spectacular! You get so caught up in the song you neglect to realize is tracks at over 7 minutes... in fact you wish it were longer! A++<br />Wasted Years: The song that made me pick up the album in the first place. This would also be the last of their &quot; seven consecutive gold records&quot; One of my favorite songs to sing along with.  A<br />Sea of Madness: IMO, the weakest track on the album ( but still a great song) I suppose I olny say that because the riffs on this one aren't memorable as the other song's... still has great lyrics to sing along with!  B<br />Heaven Can Wait: Oh Yeah!! It's safe to say a lot of people who own this album loves this song the most. I love the riffs but the big sing-along part before the guitar solos is a great way to get the adrenaline going... &quot; Whooo-oooh-oooh...&quot;  A+<br />The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner: Long enough song title already! Yeah... anyway, I've read some reviews on this song before saying it's not the great... I disagree... It's my favorite song on the album! The guitar playing is top notch and while the lyrics aren't as great as other Maiden songs, it works for me... give this one a listen!  A++<br />Stranger in a Strange Land: Another song that was released as a single... I actually like this one more than Wasted Years. One thing that I've always loved about Maiden is their rhythm... this song is a great example of that... oh yeah, Adrians solo is quite sweet, too!  A+<br />Deja Vu: Perhaps their shortest song title? I find this song a little clever because, besides Dave's guitar intro, most of this song incorporates little bits and pieces from the other songs on this album... besides the title track and Sea of Madness, this would be my fave song to sing along with.  A<br />Alexander the Great: The album closes with the epic song about... well, Alexander the Great! The lyrics are biographical and basically tells you of his rise and fall. Another memorable riff and a powerful chorus!  A+<br />... If you've never bought a Maiden album before this may not be the best choice for you... hold off until you own Number of the Beast, Piece of Mind and Powerslave. For those of you who own lots of Maiden, but not this one... go find it now!!most of this song incorporates little bits and pieces from the other songs on this album... besides the title track and Sea of Madness, this would be my fave song to sing along with.   A<br />Alexander the Great: The album closes with the epic song about... well, Alexander the Great! The lyrics are biographical and basically tells you of his rise and fall.

B00013EY7Q|1.0|I was very disappointed in the movie.  It had good reviews so I was expecting something special.  I kept turning up the sound in an effort to hear what was being said.  I would like to have turned on a few lights to see who was talking.  There was no plot and no story line.  The good part was you had a feeling of being in Tokyo.  Bill Murray is always a favorite but this was his worst role.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|This definitely ranks up there with Live Aid, Concert for NYC, and others. In a lot of ways, this surpasses them. The photography and lighting are beautiful. The Indian piece sets a nice spiritual beginning. The songs gave me an insight into why George loved Indian music so much.<br />The musicians were outstanding. Eric Clapton was excellent as musical director/participant. His vocals and guitar playing were in top form. Jeff Lynne did well on the Travelling Willburys and solo George material. Tom Petty singing Taxman and I need You was perfect. Those songs fit his range so well. Billy Preston singing My Sweet Lord gave it a nice gospel feel to it. Ringo did very well singing Photograph and Honey Don't. While some feel these songs were out of place, George co wrote the first one with Ringo and did love Carl Perkins. It should be noted when Carl Perkins (who also died of cancer in 1998) passed away, George sang at his funeral. Some people have stated Paul was trying to &quot;steal the show&quot;. I don't know if they saw the same concert that I did. Paul did excellent on For You Blue and All Things Must Pass. He also did great on sharing vocals on While My Guitar Gently Weeps, and blending into Eric Clapton's part on Something. You could tell the grief and celebration was in all performers.<br />This is a concert to get for anyone who loves George, the Beatles, or music in general. I can't add any more praise to this DVD. I suspect when historians are debating the best concert/DVD of 2000-2010; this will be at the top of the list.
B00018D44U|4.0|If you're expecting &quot;Come Away with Me&quot; part II, then you're probably wise to stay away from this one.  Instead of sticking to straight blues/jazz, Norah branches out to include folk and country in her sophmore effort.  I was completely blown away by her first album, so I expected to have the same reaction to her second one.  I didn't.  But I have listened to it all of the way through about ten times now and it has really grown on me!  &quot;Humble me&quot; is a great track, as is &quot;Carnival&quot;.  She does throw in a bluesy track or two like &quot;What am I to you?&quot;  For those people who accuse Norah of being boring or sleep-inducing, my response to them is...she is not trying to be some no-talent pop singer who dances around scantily clad.  Go buy Britney or Christina's latest if you want that! (Or just rewind your Tivo and watch the Janet Jackson Superbowl stunt for the millionth time!)
B00008LOS1|5.0|Who's Next DELUXE EDITION includes The Orginal Album, The New York Record Plant Session (that have been newly remixed), and The Young Vic Live. To start of The Orginal Album on the Deluxe Edition which includes hits like Baba O'Riley, My Wife, Behind Blue Eyes, and Wont Get Fooled Again sounds better than the orginal album. The New York Plant Sessions are the real prize on this CD all Previously Unreleased including Baby Dont You Do It, Getting In Tune, Pure and Easy, Love Aint For Keeping, Behind Blue Eyes, and Wont Get Fooled Again. The second disc is my favorite with all The Young Vic Show live most of them are also Previosly Unreleased. The band was at its top when they played The Young Vic the whole concert was very vibrant. My favorites are Pure And Easy and Water. Today their have been many deluxe editions for numerous groups the who has taken on the deluxe edition renewing all their album to a deluxe edition I thank them for that because your getting more music on thses deluxe editions then you would have got on the orginal album. This CD sounds great expescially The Young Vic show any who fan buy this one for one reason the outtakes, and the live recordings.
0552998931|4.0|Joanne Harris has written a beautiful novel that grabs the reader from the start.  She uses imagery, great detail, and clever dialogue to portray the little French village of Lansquenet and the diverse characters within the village.  All of the characters are fully developed and most are dynamic in nature.  Through the main character, Vianne Rocher, Joanne teaches the reader the importance of generosity and respect for others.  We should also not deny ourselves happiness because of what others may think.  I highly recommend this book to all, especially chocolate lovers!
B000002JSP|4.0|Led Zeppelin acheived many great things through their whole career I have always loved Led Zeppelin. This album toped the billboard ranked number 1 when it was released. Led Zeppelin though were at a down point around the time 1978 through 1979 John Bonham had a alcohol addiction that caused him his death in 1980. This was Led Zeppelins last album I always loved this album Fool In The Rain always sounded to good to be true. Also I loved the song All Of My Love the band were going differnt directions writing differnt sounding songs. They always had a great piece of mind on stage and in the studio I personally think their the best rock n roll band that played live shows. When they were in the studio they experimented with differnt things. After they recorded this they had already made rock history with all their 8 albums before In Through The Out Door. I dont think this was Led Zeppelins best album I wish their could have been more Led Zeppelin. When John Bonham died the band split that is when Led Zeppelin vanished. When they released CODA they came back to life. Know in 2004 Led Zeppelin have released a two set DVD and a three disc CD How The West Was Won thats when you hear Led Zeppelin at their best. All the footage and audio re-lives Led Zeppelin. The band has never died through the music industry or through rock history they have done nothing but lived out to their careers. All the band members now days do their own thing. I think John Bonham played the best drumming on In Through The Out Door expescially on Fool In The Rain WOW!!!!. Led Zeppelin finished their career with 9 studio albums. May Led Zeppelin Live!!!!!!!!!!
B00006CXXU|5.0|This is a mature, sophisticated, artistic piece of work and who would have thought it came from Christina Aguilera.  I always knew she had more vocal talent than all of her other pop counterparts put together, but I never thought she had the artistic vision and musicianship that she has displayed in this album not to mention a very talented songwriter that has already developed her own style.  This album is sure to set her far far apart from her other peers and hopefully we will see bigger and better things from her in the future.  She probably could change the pop world from what it is today with songs like &quot;Beautiful&quot; and &quot;The Voice Within&quot; that do more than talk about trivial things, but are more socially conscience.  Something we need most of all in these days.<br />Standout tracks : <BR>Walk Away<BR>Fighter<BR>Loving Me 4 Me<BR>Beautiful<BR>Make Over<BR>Cruz<BR>The Voice Within<BR>I'm OK<BR>Keep On Singing My Song
B00006V9A0|5.0|This CD is awesome, Jasomat you suck.  Nirvana is awesome.  If you like this cd you should also check out SOAD, and maybe AFI.
B00000K3CR|4.0|\\"Big\\" is funny. Tom Hanks in \\"Big\\" is as funny as in Forrest Gump, as touching as \\"Sleepless in Seattle,\\" and as goofy as \\"Turner and Hooch.\\" You see the beginnings of the star of \\"Castaway,\\" \\"Apollo 13,\\" and \\"Catch Me If You Can.\\" Hanks took on a solid movie and made it a great one.<br /><br />The story is simple, based on classic plotlines that extend back through fairy tales. Josh, the boy, is bummed his life is dictated by his small size and young age. He is unexpectedly granted his wish to be 'big', which means 30 years old. He then faces the adventures of being a grown-up.<br /><br />Scenes from this movie are famous, including the FAO Schwarz toy store dance on the keyboard floor mat. It has everything a vaudeville skit would have, from music to dance to the mix of an old and young man. It works incredibly well. Chopsticks has never been as entertaining.<br /><br />Josh becomes by serendipity the VP of toy development. Despite his immaturity, the owner feels Josh is tuned into the pulse of youth, unlike the lackeys cranking out marketing reports. His colleagues become jealous of his fast rise and unsuccessfully try to root him out. One of those trying to learn his game is Susan, but he wins her over in a confusing escapade of love.<br /><br />The movie is an overall pile of fun, but lacks in a few areas. It is dated, very stuck in the 1980s. That is tolerable. Had Josh been kidnapped, why wasn't his boyhood friend interviewed by police? Why didn't Josh ever confide in Susan while they fell in love? A number of other unanswered questions develop at the end dealing with his job, his apartment, his bank account.<br /><br />Even though I have questions, the movie is still a keeper. It is funny, makes strong statements about good parenting, and has a charm only Tom Hanks could bring. Good, clean fun... a perfect date movie.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com
B000021YQV|5.0|This CD is great, the best SOAD CD yet.  The songs are pretty easy to play, but sound very good.
B00008J4P5|5.0|i was sitting on the couch....watchin the tube minding my own business...when i flipped it to FUSE and their was the now classic ba ba ba ba ba bam bam. the chugging bassline of the strangely catchy seven nation army..my mouth fell open and i started to drool...i immediately waited till the video was over..and went to Wal Mart and bought this album...i wore it out...had to buy it again...every damn track on elephant is worth more than just an ear..its worth your whole head, body, soul, and mind....whoever does not own this album..your life is useless incomplete...do what the music tells you..buy Elephant...enjoy
B00011RPB0|5.0|Lost in Translation is a beautiful film. Sofia Coppola's 70 page script was a true exercise in self-restraint, resulting in a rich yet muted film. It's an incredibly pleasant surprise to find a film that doesn't feel the need to tell a big story, but instead to explore the nuances in a small and interesting relationship.<br />The soundtrack is excellent, the cinematography is gorgeous and the characters are incredibly rich.
B00008LDPU|2.0|Okay, I didn't mind the first Matrix film, but hated the other two.  I thought I might enjoy Animatrix, as I quite like anime and I hoped knowing more of the backstory would bring me a little closer to enjoying the live-action (if you can call it that, ahaha) trilogy.<BR>Animatrix was an overall waste of my time (the first film 'Final Flight...' isn't even anime, and is basically a ridiculous attempt at non-pornographic pornography), 'A Detective Story' being the only real standout for me.  'The Second Renaissance' is kinda neat, but really it's nothing new if you know anything about anime film.  There are interesting little bits every now and then, but you have to sit through the dross to get to them.<BR>Mostly, it's very nice to look at, graphic and disturbing at times, but would probably be cooler to have playing mute on your bigscreen TV at a geek party with some Aphex Twin or ATR in the stereo.<BR>I was disappointed (although not surprised) but I'm sure it's a necessity for the fanboy crowd.  Everyone else, keep your money.
B00004STDN|3.0|Since I am writing this review, I am also publicly confessing to having spent two hours watching Cliffhanger. After this, nothing I suffer in life can be a humiliation. <br />This movie received four Razzie nominations: Worst picture of the year, worst screenplay (Sylvester Stallone), worst supporting actress (Janine Turner) and worst supporting actor (John Lithgow). There are a couple of injustices here: Stallone was denied his rightful, annual Razzie nomination for worst actor. The jury must have been stacked with Stallone fans that year. And I enjoyed Lithgow's over-the-top turn as the leader of the crooks. <br />But you can't argue with Janine Turner's (Northern Exposure) nomination: I could have given a better and sexier performance as a female, in spite of being a bit, shall we say, well-nourished, and having a mustache.<br />This movie made a ton of money, which also makes sense. It's entertaining. Director Renny Harlin knows how to make action thrillers. In this one, the Treasury Department is transporting over $150 million in $1000 bills by jet; a band of crooks aims to rob the couriers. The money ends up on the snowy side of a mountain, so the crooks kidnap world-class mountain rescue experts Sylvester Stallone and Michael Rooker, to track it down.<br />Norman Kent and Alex Thomson's cinematography is breathtaking, the stunts are truly death-defying, and some of the actors are good, most notably Rooker, Ralph Waite (as a rescuer), Lithgow and Rex Linn (as a treasury agent).<br />Since we live in a therapeutic society, I can't take responsibility for my actions -- it was all my 3-year-old son's fault. The movie came on late at night, after he had woken up (and while I was supposed to be working), and he insisted we see it together. It turns out, his judgment was excellent, as Cliffhanger is perfectly suited for the sensibility of a three-year-old boy.<br />In case you have too much money on your hands, you can order this from Amazon. If your neighbors see you taking the video package from your mailbox, you can just say, \\"Oh, I thought I'd finally give Gone with the Wind a shot.\\"<br />Should you decide, instead, to rent Cliffhanger from a video store, you might try a trench coat, dark glasses, and a hat pulled down low on your face. Or as with other pornographic films, you could say to yourself, \\"What the hell, my neighbors are buying the same trash,\\" and go in as you are.<br />The Critical Critic, March 6, 2004.
0930289528|4.0|Everybody already knows (or SHOULD) how great Alan Moore is, so I won't carry on about that.<BR>V For Vendetta is a gorgeous Orwellian piece.  It's harsh, cryptic, witty, and...well, should probably be studied in schools to accompany '1984'.<BR>It's always kind of embarrassing when you get asked what you read, and you try to explain that not all comic books involve words like &quot;Blammo!&quot; and &quot;Zock!&quot; and big-breasted women with silly names.  If anyone you know ever doubts the integrity of the comic book/graphic novel genres - my advice is buy them a copy of both 'V' and 'Watchmen'.  They'll come crawling back eating their words.<BR>To the average American audience (who generally won't have a clue about anything that isn't all Yanked up) do be aware that Alan Moore is about as British as they come, and his prose is reflective of this in a major way.  Most people don't realise that V sports a Guy Fawkes mask - they don't know who Fawkes even was.  If you don't get the humour or the references, you probably never will gain a full understanding of either.<BR>This isn't your average guy-in-tights-saves-hot-chick book.  It's dark, it philosophizes, it'll probably make you think about what's going on in the world. Therefore, it's not for everyone.<BR>'V For Vendetta' is strictly for discerning readers, and may even bridge the gap for some between the worlds of plain books and comics.  We can only hope. And remember...<BR>England Prevails!
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Extremely, extremely awesome CD. My favorite CD and artist. Gavin is such a great singer/songwriter/pianist. Most artists these days don't write their own songs, and for Gavin to write his own, they are remarkable. The lyrics of his songs are so soul touching, it will make you never want to turn off the CD player. This is how I rate the CD,Chariot.<br />1.Follow Through- i heard this song on the radio at a store today and i was so exited. Great song. The first words...&quot;Oh this is a start of something good..&quot; just say it all. 10/10<BR>2.Chariot- Great song, great lyrics. enough said. 9/10<BR>3.Just Friends-Good song for people who just broke up 9/10<BR>4.[Nice to meet you]Anyway-awesome song 10/10<BR>5.Chemical Party-HILARIOUS. Love it. 10/10<BR>6.Belief-Very, very beautiful song. Great lyrics.One of my favorites. 11/10<BR>7.Crush-not my favorite song..shows his &quot;youngness&quot; if you will...but nothings bad on this CD. 8/10<BR>8.I Don't Wanna Be-My FAVORITE song on the CD. It's so powerful and it just gives you the chills. I love it. 11/10<BR>9.Meaning-Great song again 10/10<BR>10.More than anyone-yet another one of my favorites..very very pretty song. 11/10<BR>11.Over-Rated-OK song, not the best, but good way to end the CD.
B00005JM0B|4.0|Terminator 3 is NOT like Terminator 2, but you know what, thats ok.  Terminator 2 is great, but at times it's a little too much.  Terminator 3 brings the fun back into the franchise.  It has an extremely interesting plot (and figuring the end of Terminator 2 it did a good job explaining what was going on) and in my opinion, Terminator 3 has the best ending out of all of the movies.  It's a great surprise that a lot of people weren't expecting that takes the Terminator franchise to a whole new level.  Arnold of course is great and so is Nick Stahl as John Connor.  The TX is beautiful yet dangerous at the same time and the fights between the TX and the T-850 are unbelievable.  I HIGHLY reccomend this movie to a terminator fan or a fan of action movies in general.  It should be noted that you can still enjoy this movie even if you haven't seen the first 2 terminators.
B000002MFN|5.0|Nowadays we see Madonna very bold singing American Life, with anti-war themed video...but some people forgot how much she shocked the world not too many years ago in the 90's with her infamous book SEX and the CD Erotica. That record has some of Madonna's best work, yet it only sold about 6 million copies...The CD was overlooked, I believe, and it really has a variety of great music, it starts off with a very bass loaded Club song that seems like some form of hip hop mixed with dance, called EROTICA [as you all know], one of her best tracks. Then there's FEVER which is great for clubs, it has a classy dance rythem, very 90's beat. Then theres the oldschool hip hop themed BYE BYE BABY which is a very great track. After that is DEEPER AND DEEPER which is one of the best dance songs of the 1990's. Where life BEGINS is next, it's kind of blues with a kind of poppy effect, very bob your head, but not dancy, then theres the amazing 'Bad Girl' which is one of Madonna's best songs ever! Then WAITING which is so great, it has great words/vocals and the beat is a bass filled hip hop/bob ya head rythem. Then there's theif of hearts which is a great dance song with a very hard hitting dance beat. Then there's WORDS which is one of the best songs ever made! It has an amazing chorus and the words are great and strong and the beat is the danciest ever, has a kind of almost hip hopy beat if you imagine it without the high pitched madonna vocals, just the beat. Number 10 is RAIN, among the top 5 best ballads of the 1990's. Then there's why's it so hard, which is a regge pop mixed type song with a great message. Then comes IN THIS LIFE, which is a nice slow song remembering her lost friends who died from aids. DID YOU DO IT? Is the remix of waiting which is mostly performed by a rapper and madonna does the chorus, told you it was an old school hip hop beat! Then the last song may very well be the best yet most confusing of all...SECRET GARDEN, it makes absolutely no sense, but I'm trying to see if I can find out, but the beat is so new and kind of blended with hip hop jazz and almost blues too, it's amazing, very rythmatic and pretty bassy too. CHECK OUT THIS CD, BECAUSE MADONNA PUTS IT DOWN WITH THIS CD! A MUST!
B000000WA4|5.0|This CD is some of The Smashing Pumpkins...not to mention Billy Corgan's best work to date. I myself, am a large fan of The Smashing Pumpkins, as well as Zwan, and basically everything Billy Corgan. <br />When I first heard this CD I was enchanted, entranced and amazed. This CD is quite possibly the favourite of mine by SP. Not only does it have the most tracks on it (for your listening pleasure) but it was some of their most diverse work to date. MCIS combines haunting love tales with a wistfulness you can't help but feel inside you. Then there are the more guitar and drum heavy songs where you feel it thumping in your chest, your adrenaline surges...and you have a power rush. <br />What I'm trying to say is that the beauty within this album is that it transports you into the song. You feel what he feels singing it, literally and metaphorically. Let's throw in some spiritually and mentally too.You can't help but buy this album. Whether out of curiousity because you're trying to break into pumpkins...or because you're a true pumpkins fan. This album is a piece of artwork, and if I didn't love it so much, I think I'd have it framed.
B000002NJS|5.0|When I first heard &quot;Frozen&quot; and &quot;Ray of Light&quot; back in 1998, I wasn't sure what to make of Madonna's new musical direction. I had grown up with the Madonna who did &quot;I'll Remember&quot; and &quot;Take A Bow&quot;. However,&quot;The Power of Goodbye&quot; changed my mind and I knew I had to get this album. And what a breath of fresh air it was in the pop world (and to me). Each song is very earthy and stands on its own.<BR>Drowned World/Substitute For Love: I absolutely love this song, as it provides an excellent intro to the album.  Its earthiness and musical spectrum provide a beautiful palette for the listener. And after much quiet introspection it has an explosive (to some degree) climax<BR>Swim: One of the album's best songs, there's a lot going on here. Absolutely perfect with its instrumentation and textures.<BR>Ray of Light: A hugely important dance track from Madonna. While I appreciate it's impact, it's never been one of my favorites, but the video is spectacular<BR>Candy Perfume Girl: I suppose this one has an odd title and lyrics, but the music is incredible<BR>Skin: an interesting, flawless uptempo number. As repetive as it sounds, every song is noteworthy for its textures and musical subtleties<BR>Nothing Really Matters: The last single from this album unfortunately flopped. The odd video probably didn't help, but this song is quite good, and is lyrically similar to something Madonna may have done in the mid-90s<BR>Sky Fits Heaven: Another superb uptempo song with nice lyrics<br />Shanti/Ashtangi: this one is very unusual, with Indian lyrics I think. The music is worth the listen, though<BR>Frozen: ahhhh, who doesn't remember this beautiful first single. This song was the album's biggest hit (in America) and it's easy to see why. The music and Madonna's traditional &quot;mmmmmmmm&quot;-ing envelope you as you listen. <BR>The Power of Goodbye: This absolutely perfect, underperforming song is one of my favorite Madonna songs ever.With thoughtful lyrics conveying sadness, pain, and hope, this one is perfect. And the video, of course, was too.<BR>To Have and Not To Hold: once again, there is a lot going on  here. This song is sort of a paradox in itself. <BR>Little Star: This is a song written for Lourdes. Very nice and quite sweet.<BR>Mer Girl: this one is very odd, and an odd way to close the album. It's another song about Madonna's mother, and it is of course sad.<br />Overall, this album is exceptional. Depending on your Madonna preferences, &quot;Ray of Light&quot; may have to grow on you. But if you don't have it already, it's worth the purchase alone for &quot;Frozen&quot;, &quot;Swim&quot; and &quot;The Power of Goodbye&quot;. The other tracks are just hidden gems and special gifts from the Queen of Pop herself.
B000002AGN|4.0|I only recently discovered this album as I was browsing through a cd store in Melbourne. I heard it being played over the loud speakers and I instantly recognised the song (Blue Rondo Alla Turk) as I had heard a version of it before, but I couldn't work out who was playing it, or what instrument it was. At first I thought it was soprano sax ! Anyway, it sounded fantastic, a really different rendering of the blues. It certainly sounded out of place in a large department style cd store that stocked mostly mainstream music. I ended up buying the cd for $10 Australian, which is extremely cheap for any cd. For that small sum of money, Time Out became an almost indispensible part of my life for about three months. I have heard so many jazz artists, from Parker to Coltrane to Bud Powell to Wynton Marsalis. Each one I prize because of their individual style of playing. I never thought I would find two other such players on one cd. Both Paul Desmond and Dave Brubeck are, for me, among the most polished and inventive improvisers of all time. Their compositions on this album (all originals) are also strikingly unique and lyrical. I must admit, it did take me several listenings to actually enjoy the music, but after that I was hooked. My personal favourites are Strange Meadow Lark, a pretty medium tempo ballad, and Kathy's Waltz, which features a standout improvisation from Desmond. I have since bought several other recordings from Desmond and Brubeck, all of them gems, and each exemplifying the lyrically beautiful and completely infallible improvisatory technique of both musicians. If you are looking for a good introduction to these two, slightly advanced musicians, this is the one.
B000000M4M|5.0|While many say &quot;You're Living All Over Me&quot; is the classic (and it is amazing) this is the one that got one Dinosaur Jr. on the list of &quot;high-class&quot; indie rockers. With good reason too. J Mascis' lazy voice, which is not a bad thing, and noisy distorted guitar spiked with feedback, Lou Barlow's (who went on to form the wonderful band Sebadoh) catchy bass lines, and Murph's laid-back one second and crazily energetic the next drumming all form to make an amazing sound. In fact, back in the day along with &quot;The Minutemen,&quot; &quot;Husker Du,&quot; and &quot;The Meat Puppets&quot; helped define the SST scene. <br />From the open toe-tapping song &quot;Freak Scene,&quot; you know this is a winner. How J manages to make an amazingly amazing song out of just five chords (E,D7,A,Em,and F#m) is beyond me. I'd assume the song is about the indie scene at the time, least that's what I'd think. &quot;Let It Ride&quot; is the first example of old Lou's bass skills. &quot;Pond Song&quot; is a melodic song with good vocals and cool guitar work. I'm pretty sure there are two guitars on this one, and maybe on some others, too. The other songs are just as good, in their own way. I'd say &quot;Don't&quot; is a midunderstood song. It's supposed to be ironic, J screaming &quot;WHY DON'T YOU LIKE ME&quot; at the top of his lungs, making it obvious why &quot;they&quot; think he's obnoxious and don't like him, all on top of endless fancy guitar sounds and solos.<br />All in all, you probably don't want to get a newer Dino Jr. record first because, while I still really like the new ones, most fans have to admit those albums weren't particulary revolutionary. I'd reccomend this because it's at least a little more accsesible than &quot;You're Living All Over Me,&quot; and still represents Dinosaur Jr. at their peak.
B00005JKDR|3.0|Why do people think this movie is so great? I mean all it is about is some monsters that find out it's not so great to scare little kids. The only reason I rated it 3 stars is because I'm trying to be nice, ok!
B0000DD7LC|4.0|Its just absolutely heartwarming to both know and hear someone is making beautiful music nowadays. Music has drastically been changed by countless &quot;artists&quot; who ironically dont know anything of it as an art. Although not a perfectly solid collection, Alicia has somehow pushed the envelope here by forging melodic and harmonious songs. Hardly what everyone wants to listen today. She wants to re-usher that era when people listen, really listen. There are a lot of beautiful songs here. When You Really Love Someone, If I Aint Got You, You Dont Know My Name, Samsonite Man and If I Was Your Woman are some of them. This album is more subtle than Songs in A Minor. But unlike Songs it doesnt have any filler. Honestly. All songs are somehow independent and unique from one another. Some songs like the ones i enumerated stand out but the others will be too after several sessions. Its a great album. Not perfect but great.
B00005RZV4|5.0|How do you describe the nine inch nails live album? It's unreservedly unbelievable (the understatement of the year). Trent exhibits an authentic uncontaminated sense of emotion in every word he utters. I would buy this album just for the live performance of `The Day the World Went Away'...it made me cry. There are no other words to describe this album other than incredible, you will be in awe of how worthy this album is of every dollar that you have invested into it.

078401213X|2.0|I was extremely disappointed with this movie.  I had read all the reviews and had high expectaions.  After seeing it I felt nothing.  I was not disturbed, unnerved, did not replay scenes or have questions running in my mind.  Just because a movie is plodding and pedantic does NOT mean it is a masterpiece.  The only aspect of this movie that saves it from a zero is that it looks great.  B&amp;W does create a certain bleakness.
B00008977N|5.0|Can't add a whole lot to what's already been <BR>said.. but Everytime I watch it, it is just like<BR>watching it again for the very First time. Very<BR>Powerful.. concert<BR>Best concert I've ever seen...highly recommend..
0671015206|5.0|I found it interesting that according to this great thesis by Stanley and Danko, a full 5% of all the Millionaires created their wealth in sales.<br />The study futher states that those millionaires made their money in sales, became very good at selling, earned an excellent living and saved and invested a substantial part of their income. As a result, became millionaires.<br />The last part is where most people go wrong. They spend all of their income; they spend first and never set up an investment plan.<br />Read and apply the principles in The Millionaire Next Door. Consider making selling your profession. Make a committment to become excellent and save/invest a substantial portion of your income.<br />There is no level of income that you can't outspend.
B00005V3Z4|1.0|I like suspense, horror, cult stuff etc. This film sucks. Plot is thin, filmmaking is high school; it is not a keeper. It is not even worth watching. I cannot believe anybody gave this a rating; your time is better spent watching a box of cheerios.
0385504209|2.0|Be warned, Brown spends this entire book bashing Christians and everything they hold dear.  He simply makes up a bunch of anti-Christian propaganda and presents it as fact.
B0000YEEG2|4.0|This DVD is a must have for anyone who knows about the TV series in the 80s (in my case, the French version called &quot;Albator&quot;).<br />PROs: The quality of the animation is great and bring up tonnes of good memories. The characters are very well done. Great music!<BR>Matsumoto had many years to rework and redefine what he wants to say with these characters and settings.<br />CONs: To much emphasis on the &quot;look&quot; of the main character (Captain Herlock). Might be slow at times for people who wants lots of action.<br />Overall: Content: A, Video: A, Menu: B, Packaging: B, Extras: C.
0671646788|5.0|At first I was sceptical when my business associate Arthur Goldstuck gave me this book. After reading the first few chapters I realised this book is very sound in it's advice and very practical at the same time. Like Think and Grow Rich this book contains many practical examples of how to put the ideas into action and how it has worked wonders for others. Written in the 1950's the advice is now needed more then ever to get ahead of the pack.
0515125024|4.0|In another rapidly paced action thriller, Lee Child hero, ex military policeman and superstar Jack Reacher, as he is inclined to do, unwittingly stumbles into a kidnapping.  While ambling down a Chicago street he accidently collides into an attractive, limping and crutch toting woman knocking down her dry cleaning.  While helping her pick up her fallen garments, Reacher and the woman are accosted by two gun wielding guys and forced into a waiting car.  They are abducted and then transfered and locked into the cargo area of a truck where they are driven to an unknown destination.<br />In short order Reacher learns that his kidnap companion is FBI agent Holly Johnson who is recuperating from torn knee ligaments and on light duty for the moment.  She happens to be the daughter of Joint Chiefs of Staff leader General Johnson and also the god daughter of the president.<br />After a long arduous journey, in which Reacher declines several escape attempts to protect the injured Johnson, they finally arrive at an enclosure deep in the forests of northwestern Montana.  This geographically secure enclosure is the home of the Montana Militia, a para-military neo-Nazi group headed by a 400 pound behemoth Beau Borken.  Borken, a paranoid and maniacal son of a California farmer who blew his head off when the government repossessed his farm, is a ruthless murderer who has no use for the U.S. government.  He plans to use Holly Johnson's kidnapping to convert his militia into a separate nation!<br />The FBI gets wind of the plot through a covert operative within Borken's group.  Without presidential support they commence an operation to free Johnson.  Reacher, of course, while being held prisoner also plots to accomplish the same thing.<br />Childs' follow up to The Killing Floor, while falling a little short of the intrigue is still suspenseful and a worthwhile chapter in a continuing series.
B0000DD7LC|4.0|Alicia Keys received such critical praise and commercial success with her debut release (a great marriage R&amp;B, hip-hop, and jazz)that I was concerned that she would let it go to head and lose focus. Then, the naysayers (who love to rip down those who have received maybe too much, too soon) and those who think that she was and continues to be overpraised could say &quot;I told you so!&quot;. Well, those naysayers will have to wait as Alicia has put out an even better release than her debut. It's not perfect by far, as few things are, but she's heading in the right direction and the release grows on you more and more as you let it flow into your consciousness.<br />I love that she's not abandoned her piano arrangements as they are becoming quite an integral part of her work. The opener sets the bar for the rest of the CD and many meet or surpass the introduction.<br />The highlights include &quot;Heartburn&quot;: I love Timbaland's production and Alicia's voice combined to 10++++ and this is a single waiting to take off; &quot;If I Was Your Woman/Walk On By&quot;: Alicia makes the song truly her own vocally and there is a nice Eastern flavour to it; &quot;You Don't Know My Name&quot;: It's the non-conventional first single that grows on you. It's a mid-tempo song with a great interlude for the spoken word and an amazing outro. Also it just might be the best written song on the CD; &quot;If I Ain't Got You&quot;: Showcases the raspier side of Alicia's voice and she just belts this song in such a way that feels just right. I fear that this song may become one of those songs that the kids from &quot;American Idol&quot; destroy in an attempt to show that they can SING (usually not);&quot;Diary&quot;: Slowly reveals itself, she sounds amazing, and you can feel the great touch of Tony!Toni!Tone! in the arrangement and in the choruses. I am listening to this song right now and it gets better which each listen. I also like the build-up, instrumentation and choruses of &quot;Wake Up&quot; as well as the distorted chorus of &quot;So Simple&quot; (which although sounds a little like Kelis on her debut CD) is an OK song, but the chorus makes it pop; &quot;When You Really Love Someone&quot;, would be a great song if it did not sound EXACTLY like &quot;Fallin'&quot;. The piano and Alicia's voice can allow you to enjoy it if you think of it as a sequel of sorts &quot;Fallin'&quot;. I LOVE the Santana-like guitar work on &quot;Feeling U, Feeling Me (Interlude)&quot; as well as the instrumentation and breeziness of &quot;Noboby Not Really (Interlude)&quot;.<br />As you can see there is a lot of great stuff to be found on Alicia's release but there are a few things that keep it from being a 5. I don't like Alicia's voice and lyrical flow on parts of &quot;Karma&quot;. &quot;Dragon Days&quot; and &quot;Slow Down&quot; seem like unnecessary filler, while &quot;Samsonite Man&quot; is the only truly awful song on the CD.<br />All in all this is an excellent release and I would recommend it highly to anyone who likes Alicia. I've taken steps to make this release a 5 by making my own copy and taking out the 4 songs that don't do anything for me. While some people sometimes feel shortchanged by releases that don't take up most of the CD, sometimes less is more as exemplified by Meshell Ndegeocello's last CD which clocks at less than 40 minutes. Alicia is someone to keep watching and I think that now that she's got her sophomore release out and has done a great job, she can keep trying to grow as she is still very young, albeit talented beyond almost most younger singers' wildest dreams.uot;Wake Up&quot; as well as the distorted chorus of &quot;So Simple&quot; (which although sounds a little like Kelis on her debut CD) is an OK song, but the chorus makes it pop; &quot;When You Really Love Someone&quot;, would be a great song if it did not sound EXACTLY like &quot;Fallin'&quot;.

B000089RVX|5.0|WoW I am not a fan of this genre, so this was actually the first album that I bought and I truly loved it.  This CD doesn't have many tracks, but big things come in small pacakges.  I'd rather get 10-tracks that sound good then a 20-track CD with not much on it.
B00003CX8U|4.0|1979 was one heck of a year for American cinema (\\"Apocalypse Now\\",\\"Kramer Vs. Kramer\\", \\"Starting Over\\", \\"The China Syndrome\\") and leading male performances (Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman and Peter Sellers just to name a few)and \\"All That Jazz\\" certainly meets both criteria. Although I hate it when reviewers give too much away, it's safe to say that most people familiar with the film know that this is Bob Fosse's not-so-thinly veiled autobiographical film and viciously honest portrayal of the central character, Joe Gideon, a brilliant but deeply troubled and self-absorbed director/choreographer who has ongoing problems with drugs, alcohol, and fidelity. The firm centers around Joe's new Broadway production, while he concurrently tries to edit a new movie, interpersonal relations, and ..... one other thing that I will leave viewers to find out for themselves. Triva and pop culture buffs will recognize that the new show that the lead character, played with bravura by Roy Scheider, is working on is none other than \\"Chicago,\\" which initially flopped but when on to be revived on Broadway to win several Tonys and you know all about the Oscars that the movie version received.<br />Seeing this movie there are many elements that make it hard to believe that it was released a quarter of a century ago. The best example of how current it looks can be found in the sensual and acrobatic choreography that defines Fosse. But the kicker here that although Fosse is does an excellent job in the serio-dramatic sequences, it is the MTV-like direction that Fosse brings to brilliant dance sequences that feel more than contemporary as no amount of grinding or posturing by Madonna, Britney et al can compare to a sequence titled \\"AirRotica.\\" It is adult eye and ear candy that will make those who've only seen Paula Abdul's late 1980s homage to it see why it is such a masterpiece. The acting is also outstanding and holds up quite nicely. Besides the aforementioned Scheider, there are unsung performances by Ann Reinking, Sandahl Bergman (man this woman can dance and it's really too bad that Hollywood did not know what to do with her) and an actress named Erzsebet Foldi, who plays Joe's daughter. Her performance to me (especially when considering the challenging dance numbers) has to be one of the most accomplished performances ever by a child actor. I don't think she ever acted after being on this film.<br />This movie represents one of the few movie musicals that worked after the 1960s and the genre is so challenging that it took more than 20 years for Hollywood to do it well. Like the man, the movie suffers from some excesses which could have been curtailed to make for a 5 star review. I am not referring to the AMAZING numbers towards the end of the movie, but there are some attempts to show the seamy underbelly of the showbiz world and one too obvious attempt to show the audience why the character behaves in the manner in which he behaves. Also, there is an annoying cigarette fetish that is taken to almost cartoonish heights and really distracts when it is trying to highlight other elements. I also thought most of the scenes pertaining to Joe's editing of a stand-up comic were repetitive and really brought little to the table.<br />Notwithstanding these mild deviations, I think that this is one of the strongest and most consistently entertaining movies that has been made using the musical genre as a point of departure. It's not perfect, but a must see for adults as I don't think this movie is for kids. Fosse's genius comes across in not only his choreography of the dancers but in how he makes sure that the camera works to enhance what is important to him. This talent is most evident in an opening scene that has been attempted and imitated many times, but it has never been as good this one.nsung performances by Ann Reinking, Sandahl Bergman (man this woman can dance and it's really too bad that Hollywood did not know what to do with her) and an actress named Erzsebet Foldi, who plays Joe's daughter.

B000084T18|5.0|I'm so sick reading these reviews where people give it 1-Star and then say &quot;This album is filled with violence and explicit lyrics...&quot;  Well gee, what did you expect?  Barney Songs?  Well, then you bought the wrong CD, kid!<br />You already know what's on this CD before you got it, so stop crying wolf already!  Most CDs have 1 or 2 songs that you truly like, but this one has 75% of tracks that I listen regularly.  Like I said, you will either like or you won't, but if you know what this CD is about and not offended by violence then you will love it!  Peace~

0767903862|4.0|I had to read A Walk In The Woods for a grad school class. I liked Bryson's sense of humor and decided to give another book a try. In a Sunburned Country continued Bryson's wacky adventures but in a new land. It was entertaining and educational. I almost feel like I'm watching the travel channel while I read his books. I recommend it for a quick read.
B000001ESP|5.0|Just letting you know, I messed up, this review is supposed to be for 2112.  Sorry.<br />I'm not too big of a classic-rocker, but you just cannot disregard Rush as one of the best, EVER.  I've always kind of known about them and aknowledged their existence, but never really cared about them until someone said I might like Rush if I was a Coheed and Cambria fan.  So I decided to check them out, and the inspiration is definitely there, and it's very obvious.  Though Claudio Sanchez claims they'd never listened to Rush before, it's very curious as to how similar they are.  Anyway, back to Rush.  The epic song \\"2112\\" is one of the greatest to ever be recorded to a compact disc, or anything else. Wait, the whole cd is just amazing.  Buy no matter what your interests are, you should be able to respect these guys immensely.
6304696566|1.0|Beware!!! If you stick this DVD in your machine on the side marked &quot;widescreen -- aspect ratio 1.85:1&quot; you will see even LESS of it than by watching the 1.33:1 side!!!! This is NOT the true widescreen version of The Searchers. Instead, Warner Bros have -- disgustingly and insultingly -- simply taken the 1.33:1 print, cropped the bottom and top, and magnified what's left to make it fill the screen!!!! What this means is, you actually see MORE if you watch the 1.33:1 side of the disc!!!!!! On the 1.85:1 side, you lose bits not only from the left and right of the original print, but from the top and bottom as well!!!!!<br />The film itself, of course, is brilliant, one of my 10 faves, and stunning even when seen in its old 1.33:1 ratio. Just don't watch the fake widescreen version -- and write to WB immediately to demand they release a proper edition of this classic!!!!!!
B000099T2L|3.0|I don't believe she should have won five grammy's she could have gotten two or three but not five. I think she is just over done.

006019250X|4.0|The writing is beautiful in its simplicity, but Coelho is a perpetrator of the dreaded &quot;telling, not showing&quot;.  Mostly, he flatly explains what the reader should be feeling and what lessons he/she should glean from the text rather than encouraging him/her to think and figure things out.<BR>Of course, this is a fable, and it is designed to be readable by people of widely varying ages.  It is a nice journey tale, with a strong mystical and religious bent, which encourages people to follow their dreams, and which portrays some wonderfully exotic and magical locales.  The illustrations by Moebius are also perfectly suited to the tone of the story.<BR>On the matter of religion, Christianity was most definitely a strong theme.  However, I never found it to be out of place or overly preachy on the subject, and I am a devout atheist.  The way in which religion weaves through the story is similar to and as inoffensive as the way ancient Greek spiritual practices are embedded in &quot;The Iliad&quot;.  There is no Pat Robertson to be found here.<BR>In short, &quot;The Alchemist&quot; will not alter the way you see the world.  It clearly is not intended to do so.  It is simply a highly entertaining, perhaps pleasant and comfortable, and quite simple tale to be enjoyed.
0609610570|1.0|Rather than a concise guide you'll plod through ruminations and Q&amp;A's between the two authors. Great title but falls far short of what it promises. It reads more like an interview in Forbes. You could probably summarize the books in 10 pages at most.
B00005JLO2|4.0|As we all know, this is a film that has been made countless times in the 100 years since the novel was written.  However, this is a version of the story that deserved to be made.  An epic of this magnitude is always aided by the stunning visuals of modern film-making techniques- and the cinematograpny here is amazing.<BR>The film is not perfect.  It suffers from some technical flaws, including some occassional, but rather jarring, editing holes.  However, the acting is largely superb, though I agree that it was difficult to see Kate Hudson as British, let alone upper-class.  Heath Ledger is a fine young actor and, though his accent falters a bit at times, he is more than up to the task of playing Harry Feversham.  Wes Bentley's performance was absolutely outstanding.  I never doubted the authenticity of his character (or his accent) for a second.  (Indeed, I had no idea that he was the same actor from &quot;American Beauty&quot; until I read the other reviews on this site and consequently looked it up.  Even now, I find it difficult to believe).<BR>The script is solid, if nothing terribly original, but it is based on (and tightly follows) a rather old novel.  One can find many of the cliches of the &quot;epic&quot; genre in the story and dialogue, but I entered the theater expecting them.<BR>I am a fan of epics.  My favorite film of all time is &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;, and while this version of &quot;The Four Feathers&quot; certainly isn't going to unseat David Lean's masterpiece, it is a worthy addition to my DVD collection.  It is definitely a film I don't mind watching over and over again.
6302878527|5.0|I first saw this movie when I was twelve and it was my favorite movie then.  Thirty-seven years, and a lot of life experience later, it still is.  When I first saw it, I took Mark Wallace's views on marriage very much to heart and found the difference between their early relationship and their subsequent marriage disturbing.  Seeing it so many years later, I found all his anti-marriage rhetoric as a young man hitchhiking through Europe very amusing.  American women &quot;...want what their grandmothers wanted.  Your head stuffed and mounted on the living room wall!  And if you don't like it, you can take your lovin' self elsewhere.&quot;  These lines and others are delivered within the classic framework of the man dedicated to preserving his freedom, and he keeps the anti-marriage line going throughout the film.  Yet his devotion to the woman he decides to spend his life with is clear.  Clearly, the single most touching scene for me was when Joanna returns from her affair with Maurice's brother-in-law, and Mark says, &quot;You humiliate me.  You humiliate me and then you come back.&quot;  She nods.  He reaches out and pulls her to him in a strong embrace and says, &quot;Thank God!&quot; in the most heartfelt way.  There are so many scenes that I love ... the scene in which she first tells him that she loves him and he says, &quot;I warn you.&quot; and she says, &quot;Don't.&quot;  Did Hepburn ever look lovelier than in that scene? Or when they are lying in bed the very first time and he says, &quot;This is completely against my principles,&quot; and it turns out he's talking about sleeping in hotels, rather than outdoors in a sleeping bag.  <br />I also like the part at the end where she says, &quot;There'll never be anyone else in my life like you.&quot;  When he asks if that's true she says, &quot;I hope!&quot;<br />The most revealing part of the movie for me, as an adult, was when Mark is walking out of the restaurant with his former girlfriend, Cathy Maxwell Manchester, who tells him that Howard is the &quot;husband&quot; type while he, Mark is the &quot;lover&quot; type.<br />I think the people who love this movie relate more to Joanna and Mark.  They got together because of the intensity of their relationship.  Those who hate the movie are more like Cathy and Howard.  The &quot;practical&quot; aspects of a relationship are more important for them than the emotional ones.  The message of the movie, I think, is despite the difficulties life throws you, it is ultimately more satisfying to cast your lot with the person you truly connect with.
0792164903|4.0|As my friend and I were picking out movies to watch recently, she chose this one and I cringed.  Was it a thriller (which I can generally handle) or a horror movie (which I generally can't)?  Having enjoyed the movie, I am rather surprised to read that other reviewers consider this a horror flick.  <br />As for the movie itself, it starts off in a darkly lit New York City.  All the details of those opening NYC scenes can be a little confusing at times (was that guy being tortured in the court room?), but the main thrust is clear: Crane (Johnny Depp) sticks out on the police force in 1799 because he wants to solve crimes based on scientific methods.  He nobly lobbies for his fellow policemen to go about their work more fairly, and so they send him to Sleepy Hollow to solve the case of the Headless Horseman.<br />True to his usual form, Burton suceeds in making Sleepy Hollow every bit as creepy as it should be.  The set for this town truly makes the film come alive.  As Crane comes into the eerie town, he tries to overcome his uneasiness and social awkwardness by investigating the crimes with a scientific method.  However, after encountering too many mystical things in the town, his mind starts flashing back to mysteries from his own childhood.  As his waking mind tries to solve the gruesome murders at hand, his sleeping mind is trying to remember what happened to his mother.<br />I don't want to ruin any more of the plot here.  The screenplay definitely deviates from the cartoon I saw as a child - in some ways the motivation for the killings is more rational and in some ways the &quot;solution&quot; to the crimes is even more irrational.  However, I was able to handle all the beheadings and other killings just fine.  In fact, I was more amused by the subtle humor of the film than I was frightened by the gore of it.<br />As a side note, I wondered some about the overall smoothness of the dialogue and progress of of the plot.  Though Depp once again masterfully takes on another persona, he was a bit wooden at times.  I wasn't sure if that was intentional on his part or if Crane's noble and clear-thinking yet queasy character was hard for him to portray.  In a similar manner, the dialogue between Crane and Katrina Van Tassel (Ricci) was occasionally awkward.  But, then, I thought of how many times in my life conversations have been awkward, and that without a headless horseman...so perhaps that was intentional as well.  Also, I thought the plot skipped around a bit, sometimes jumping illogically to the next scene.  However, I'm not sure if this is the result of poor editing or a Burton act of genius to make one all the more uneasy.  In any case, these little quirks pulled me out of the story at times and so it lost some momentum for me.<br />Finally, I would like to point out that witchcraft - both &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; - are quite prevelant in the film.  Depending on your view of witchcraft, you may not enjoy the ultimate lifting up of &quot;good&quot; witchcraft over all else in the movie.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Afterglow radiates lyrical and musical content that will embrace souls to emotional states, as Sarah McLachlan has done many of times before from past works.  I must admit, I have reviewed this item once before after having listen to this album only several times and was impressed.  After months of this album's release was I able to truly gasp the artistry of this cd.  Afterglow is truly a success for Sarah McLachlan as this album has already reached double platinum in the US, not to mention Canadians sales and World sales have not been tallied up, and much recognized for her hit single, \\"Fallen\\" nominated for a Grammy, as well as five Juno Awards-Juno Fan Choice, Artist Of The Year, Songwriter Of The Year, Album Of The Year, Pop Album Of The Year.-and much more.  This CD is wonderful for Sarah McLachlan fans who want to experience a much more sensual (may be incorrect word of choice, but compared to her other work, much more sensual) subtle side of Sarah.<br />1.Fallen: First released single and is still top 40 released single on Billboard.  Great instrumentation as the haunting cello greatly accompanies her vocals.  I do recommend fans to check out the `radio edit\\" of this track for there is much stronger emphasis on percussion and background vocals, thus creating a much more emotional state of being.  \\"Bitter taste of losing everything I've held so dear, I've fallen\\"<BR>(5/5)<br />2.World On Fire: This song, initially did take several times before I found myself humming the tune to.  Memorable chorus. Some people say this song is inspired by the aftermath of 9/11 but I will let you be the judge of that. \\"The more we take, the less we become\\"<BR>(4/5)<br />3.Stupid: her current released second single.  Watching the music video to this song, I'm sure that there will be a radio edit track for this song, which again I would recommend you to check out as well.  There is much more emphasis on the background vocals, further creating better texture and tonality to a great track.  This track is the edgiest you will find on this album.  Great emphasis on vocals and the cello. \\"In the deep of my weakness, I know\\"<BR>(5/5)<br />4.Drifting: This song is one of the songs I could not find myself liking very much.  The instrumentation and lyrical melodic structure within this song is weak. It is very simple and simply supports Sarah. \\"Larger than your life is your fiction\\"<BR>(1.5/5)<br />5.Train Wreck: One of my favorite tracks from this album, and I'm hoping to be released as her third single.  Great instrumentation and vocals.  The lyrics are very impacting. \\"Your eyes like midnight fireflies, light up the trenches where my heart lies\\"<BR>(5/5)<br />6. Push: this song did not catch my attention at first but only to realize the lyrical content when I was actually experiencing the meaning and content of the song.  This song basically sums up ones feeling about love for someone else, and in this case, Sarah written it for Ash.  Good lyrics. \\"When I fall, you offer me a softer place to land\\"<BR>(4/5)<br />7.Answer: the only acoustic piano accompanied (well, with light percussion), ballad.  Great lyrics and very haunting vocals. \\"In the burning of uncertainty, I will be your solid ground\\"<BR>(4/5)<br />8.Time: one of another great track found on this album.  The instrumentation is great, but the vocals are much greater.  The lyrics are truly a work of art. \\"Time here all but means nothing just shadows that move across the walls\\"<BR>(5/5)<br />9.Perfect girl: another great song, though most definitely take several listens to enjoy.  The piano and percussion are great together as they accompany the soft vocals. Sarah McLachlan has always been a great artist as to intertwine past music into her pieces, such as the introduction of this song contains what is similar to psalmody. \\"You'll find yourself, you'll find yourself in time\\"<BR>(5/5)<br />10.Dirty Little Secrets: another track that will take several listens to before enjoying, but has become one that I frequently listen to. The music within this piece is very subtle, but only needed to support the story that is unraveled by McLachlan's vocals. This piece is very intimate, singer and music that is. \\"I would not hesitate to tell you all things I never said before\\"<BR>(4/5)<br />McLachlan has created a piece of artistry that I highly recommend others to take the time to purchase and not easily dismiss 2.5 years of making.  I can no long say that this album does not compare to Surfacing or Fumbling towards Ecstasy because in reality, each album released from Sarah McLachlan is truly different.  Each album released from Sarah is like an emotional diary. This album is most definitely about the time span from 1997-2002.  I'm very much looking forward to her next album, which won't be out soon, but knowing it will be about the death of her mother and birth of her daughter, as Sarah has mentioned in interviews that it takes her about 5-6 years to process events into her albums.  So for those who are confused or misled, this album has nothing to do with the tragic death and beautiful birth of mother and daughter, respectively,  that took place in her life.  To conclude, I recommend purchasing this cd as it soothes the soul, touches hearts, and is relatable to your personal experiences.  Sarah McLachlan, with her artistic talents of composition-both lyrically and musically, and vocal strengths truly captures her character as a woman who is not afraid to reveal her faults and vulnerabilities.  Great CD. Something I recommend to listeners of all genres.
B0001ENY6M|5.0|I had not really heard of John Debney until this movie's soundtrack found its way into my collection (which includes Horner's &quot;Titanic&quot; among others, many of which are Oscar winners).  This soundtrack has some of the most stirring pieces on it that I have heard in a long time.  There is much pathos that Debney put into this work, but, given the subject matter, one must have feelings on it one way or another.  Debney's style, unlike some who have written, is not comparable to James Horner.  In fact, Horner is so distinct from Debney it's completely unfair to allege borrowing, or as some have said, &quot;theft.&quot;  As for the claim against Debney where &quot;The Last Temptation. . .&quot; is concerned, I can say little, for I have not seen, nor will I ever see, Scorcese's excuse for Christian interpretation.  The soundtrack to &quot;The Passion&quot; serves as an audible reminder of the visual remembrances of such a powerful movie.  Debney does not disappoint!
B0000AQVCL|4.0|Ever since I heard Jet on Saturday Night Live, I fell in love.  &quot;Are you gonna be my girl&quot; was the first of their songs that I heard, and its upbeat rhythm and great sing along words are totally rad for rocking out with my friends in my room.  To truely enjoy this CD and band, you have to enjoy listening to the amazing rock n' rollish YEAAAAHHHHH from the lead singer over and over again!!!  I love singing along! I also heard &quot;Cold hard b****&quot; on the radio, and I adored it.  At that point, I bought the cd, and tickets to a concert coming up.  Every song on their CD is worth listening to.  JET ROCKS!

B00004U8JV|4.0|I'm not going to praise this movie to death, we all know it has its problems here and there.  But, we all must keep in mind that &quot;popcorn movies&quot; still exist.  I realize that the original JP had economical and moral undertones, but in the end, it was intentionally a goofy monster movie (and I'd like to believe that Speilberg would say the same).  This series of films is one of the more enjoyable in recent memory, simply because it has not lost sight of what it was.  I personally don't mind saying that Michael Crichton's source material is a step down from this movie.  That's right, a step down.  I have read three of his novels (JP, Lost World, and Congo) and have been deeply disappointed in his style and his narrative.  I like the technical portions of the novels, but when you dedicate that much time to revel in such tired, meandering literature, you expect a whole lot more.  Having said that, the film, I believe, would be worth a shot at (ESPECIALLY IF YOU CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT OL' DTS AUDIO TRACK).  Heck, I'll be buying it sooner or later just for the DVD transfer.
0385504209|5.0|The Davinci Code is a VERY good book.
B00005ATQ9|5.0|Fascinating:<BR>I'm presently fascinated by the harsh critical evaluation of this movie. Typically the criticism is focused on the \\"Pace\\" or boring lack of forward motion exhibited by the director. I agree, if after 30 minutes (right about the duel scene) you aren't 100% enthralled, you need to bag-out and turn off. By that critical moment if the pace is disturbing you, the remaining 3 hours will bring you to complete distraction. <br />However, if after this first 30 or so minutes you are still tuned in, you are fully prepped for an engrossing and completely artistic experience of absolute joy. Really, that's the breaking point 30 minutes. Kubrick takes his time to make his points. God bless the man. You either get it or you don't have the time. As my film critic friend put it, \\"Hey, at that point, go watch Bad boys or Scream 5\\". The point being, it's not pop culture, it's a piece of work (art work) and it required some development. <br />It's Okay if you have other things to do, simply go do them. This movie however should not be judged by Quick edit points and chop/chop depictions of every moment. All things are given their proper width and space. <br />Perhaps if you've ever read a book, this is a similar experience. It takes time. Characters are developed and moments unfold as though reality had a place in the thing. If you choose to review this film in a critical manner, do so on it's faults, not it's pace. I will leave the faults for you to discover, frankly they are few. <br />Enjoy. <BR>Relax, have some tea. But for the sake of us all don't complain that this movie does not fit into your fast food world.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I'm a huge Sarah McLachlan fan and over the years, I think she can really do no wrong with whatever she does. Well, except for Remixed .. because I'm not into techno.<br />In reference to the reviewers who said this was 'boring &amp; depressive' because of what happened during Sarah McLachlan's 5-year-hiatus, it's actually not true. In interviews, she's said that she's kind of slow on the up-take with her songwriting .. meaning that current events don't really impact her songwriting until a few years after it. And yes, singers really used to write their own songs .. all by themselves &lt;shock, horror&gt;.  <br />Although it is 'boring &amp; depressive' there is so much emotion &amp; passion put into it. I can relate to it 100% because of recent events in my life. If you're going through a bad breakup, this album is for you. You won't feel so alone anymore. Some of my favorite songs off the album are 'Stupid' and 'Train Wreck'. <br />I wouldn't say it's her best work .. top 5 perhaps. If you're a Sarah fan .. you probably already have this and shouldn't be reading reviews anymore, but should be contributing a review! :) If you're not a fan yet, I'd suggest you start with Surfacing or Fumbling Towards Ecstacy (my fav).
0385504209|3.0|...except to write a review.<br />My own personal opinion of this book is that it's a hell of a read.  It's cheap suspense at it's best - short chapters with cliff-hangers at the end, different people's stories intertwining, and plenty of promises to get a story out but the story doesn't come fast enough.  And I LOVE a good suspense novel, as cheap as it may be.<br />Brown also tingles my senses by adding quite a bit of information about the history of Italian art and Christianity in general.  The 'facts' (as Dan Brown claims) are presented in a way to convince the reader of a conspiracy within the Catholic Church.  I find art history generally a bore, but conspiracy theories and theology are great fun to me, so I got trapped into learning about Leonardo.<br />However, there are two things about this book that I disagree with:<br />1) The way the facts are presented.  They're definitely shown in a way to present a particular argument that supports a negative recount of the Catholic Church's handling of Christ's story of existence.  I see very little evidence within the story to disprove these facts, if that's what they are.  I'm not a Christian (in fact, I abhor religion, monotheistic or polytheistic), but as a person who's fascinated by theology in general, I was disappointed to find only one side of the story here.  In fact, I'll bet that's why so many Christian readers are taking his writing a bit too personally.  In addition, some of the stuff he's presented as fact, not necessarily the stuff about theology, is pretty unrealistic.<br />2) The characters were VERY unrealistic.  This guy knows nothing about character development or portrayal, or doesn't choose to.  That's a big disappointment.<br />Overall, I'd say this bookd is entertaining in a &quot;James Bond&quot; sort of way, in that it's fun to read if you're willing to overlook the parts of it that are ridiculous.
B00018D44U|3.0|I am a Norah Jones fan but have to admit that her music is somewhat generic. The songs seem to blend into each other - besides the first single 'Sunrise' which is at least distinctive. She has a tendency to repeat a single word/line all throughout the song, until the fade out .. kind of following a formula of sorts. Not much content in the songs, not very good songwriting perhaps. I'm not a songwriter but would prefer songs where it doesn't feel like a broken record at times. <br />The good points are that it's a very nice soothing album that you can put on in the background. Plus, she does have a wonderful voice. It's more country than her previous album, but that's a good thing .. I presume that's why it's called 'Feels Like Home'.<br />Definitely recommended. It's good music to just put on during a drive home or for relaxing with a cup of hot chocolate (or coffee or whatever's your poison).<br />PS: The CD has copy-control, I haven't had any problems with it but it's just something to keep in mind .. since according to the back, it might not work with most car CD players.
B00006879E|5.0|I HAVE HEARD THE SAMPLES OF THE SONGS AND THEY ARE HOTT!!! I CANT WAIT TO GET THE ALBUM THIS GROUP IS REDICULOUS!
B00004U8PA|5.0|I happen to have seen the original theatrical show in London in the 1970s before ever discovering the film, on VHS first and then on DVD. This is indispensible to understand the new dimension given to the show on this medium, a filmed show on DVD.<br /><br />The show itself is a myth and the plot is known by heart. Some Extra-Terrestrials came on Earth with their spacecraft in the shape of an old medieval castle that is in fact a laboratory. The master of the place is Dr Frank-N-Furter and he is a re-composition of the never decomposed or decomposing Dr Frankenstein. He studies one emotion known as lust and being an extra-terrestrial he knows no limits.<br /><br />A young couple going on a trip to visit a professor of theirs, Dr Everett V. Scott as a sort of celebration of their engagement have a car breakdown in the night in a fierce storm. They decide to knock at the door of the castle they see and they get into the ET lab. After many incidents, detours and other adventures in this labyrinthine castle, they will both be initiated to sex by and with Dr Frank-N-Furter. But Dr Everett V. Scott arrives in a wheelchair and kind of saves the situation by explaining us and them what it is all about. At this time the main servants of the castle/spacecraft decide to go back to their planet Transylvania leaving behind Dr Frank-N-Furter dead but his creation Rocky Horror runs after his body and takes it away: he is in love with his maker and he is immune against the laser weapons of the ETs.<br /><br />The three humans, Dr Everett V. Scott, Brad Majors and Janet Weiss manage to get out of the castle before take off and end up the show in the mud. Brad concludes that \\"inside he is still bleeding\\", Janet that \\"the beast is still feeding\\", and the storyteller that \\"on earth some insects call the human race lost in time, lost in space and the meaning.\\"<br /><br />The show was not erotic but sexy. The film is the same sexy but not erotic. Yet it is a comedy that plays on sexually ambiguous situations, on words tremendously and on all kinds of strange costumes, effects, lightings, music. The proportion of music, singing and dancing is enormous. It is an entertaining story with a slightly titillating content.<br /><br />Now the DVD, which is the film, made and still makes this play a success beyond the theatres where it was performed.<br /><br />Apart from the opening wedding scene the whole film systematically keeps a distance from real cinema. It is not a play per se, far from it, but it is not a film either. It is somewhere in-between the two and that's the interest of the film itself over the play.<br /><br />The first element that is obvious is the filming on location for outside scenes and when it is filmed in a studio the set is that of an extremely vast castle, at least that's what they want us to believe and that vastness is emphasized by the long \\"travelling\\" of Dr Everett V. Scott in his wheelchair to come to, or be brought to the laboratory. But there are some other scenes that amplify this vast dimension; The action itself takes place in various rooms and these rooms are big and large enough to entertain a dancing body of twenty people or so. You cannot get that effect on a stage. Including several motorcycles and cars, one motorcycle in the main room of the castle too, running and smoking.<br /><br />The special effects are numerous and all add something to what a stage play would be. Sound and visual effects create the storm and the suspense necessary for the evocation of fear and danger. But there are other special effects that are more subtle and less visible. Yet without them many scenes would be flat. The main visible element in that line is the constantly changing camera shooting angle and probably camera too, and the editing that emphasizes this whirling effect by cutting and pasting small sequences one after the other of the same scene all from different angles. Then you have a lot of smoke, artefacts of all sports, theapparition of a swimming pool where you had not seen it, the falling down of the radio tower of the RKO Radio Picture logo when Rocky Horror and Dr Frank-N-Furter try to climb on it to escape Riff Raff and his sister Magenta, the ET masters of the spacecraft.<br /><br />Of course we must also think of the special effects needed to turn someone who is dressed into an entirely nude stone statue. That is both special effect and editing. And there are many instances present giving to the film a speed that it could not have on a stage and at the same time an intensity of action and peripeteia that would also be difficult on the stage.<br /><br />Finally along that line the use of TV screens to put people under surveillance is possible and frequent in the film because of the close-up shots on them that enable us to see what is on the screen, like for example Brad being sexually served by Dr Frank-N-Furter, which Janet will eventually see on the screen, though after the act itself. The film enables us to see these moments which would have been awkward on the stage, or plainly invisible.<br /><br />The last remarkable element that the DVD and film provides is the storyteller, called in the credits the criminologist, in a private library in a completely different place and atmosphere. That trick is rarely used in films, certainly not that often, at least eight times in the present case. He explains and creates a perspective, which forces us to listen and think a little bit to understand the craziness of the situation.<br /><br />That provides us with an important question about this film-DVD. The spectator is no longer confronted to a frontal and unmoving picture, but to a fast changing whirling visual spectacle. The music and the singing make it auditory too and the songs have to be understood, which means sung in a certain way which is easier on the screen than on stage since there is no distance between the actor and the mike in the post-production studio. The words are extremely important in the rhyming patterns, the rhythmic patterns and all types of other linguistic means used to give allure, speed, whirling force to the language and that has to charm our ears as well as the visual show charms our eyes.<br /><br />But at once these words imply a strong effort on our side to enjoy the meaning and there it also implies and requires a certain mental reflective distance on our side. Actually the fun of the situations and language demands that mental reflective distance. This is a common point between a stage production and a film. The original point here is that it is carried by the language as much as by the medium. Constantly the scenes keep such a distance from realistic action, even that of a cinematographic comedy. The acting, the speaking and the singing keep the film close to a stage production.<br /><br />At the same time the film-DVD contains an appeal on the audience's side to project themselves into the film, into the action, and in a way to identify with some of the characters, though the identification cannot be with one character only because of the numerous ambiguous situations. But we can identify with Rocky Horror when he mourns his \\"father\\". We can identify with Janet and Brad when they accept sex from Dr Frank-N-Furter provided he does not tell the other: let's keep our lusty episodes for our own selves. We all have done that in life for numerous things and on numerous occasions. Secrets are the keys to peace at times between partners of any type.<br /><br />Of course the main value of this DVD is the technical side of it. It can reach the whole world since it provides a great number of subtitles, ten languages plus English for the hearing impaired on the Zone 2 edition I have. And that is just the point. A musical in a theatre is always for a geographical and social elite, whereas a DVD for 3 or 4 euros or pounds is an affordable treat for everyone who understands English in the world and for everyone who speaks one of the languages provided by the subtitles. The DVD more than the VHS tape is a real revolution in the circulation, distribution and even exploitation of theatrical plays, musicals and operas, stage productions in one word including concerts.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUxtremely important in the rhyming patterns, the rhythmic patterns and all types of other linguistic means used to give allure, speed, whirling force to the language and that has to charm our ears as well as the visual show charms our eyes.<br /><br />But at once these words imply a strong effort on our side to enjoy the meaning and there it also implies and requires a certain mental reflective distance on our side.

B0000AXE8I|4.0|I watched this again last night, and it never lets me down.  No, it doesn't live up to its predecessor, but what could?  Here we are with Agent Smith replicating himself, Neo is now completely the all powerful One, the Oracle is mysteriously missing, and the crew of the Nebuchadnezzor is sent to find the keymaker?  Few movies could pull off such a ridiculous plot, but the Matrix Reloaded can.  Again we see incredible fights, and great special effects.  The bad guys are tougher, and the ending is a bigger twist than I could have hoped for.  If you are a fan of the Matrix and actually missed this, you missed a whole lot.  See this movie.
B00005JMF6|4.0|An interesting film indeed. You may be a brilliant woman psychiatrist, if you find yourself in the place of the patient after a crime you have apparently committed you will not be believed, you will be considered as crazy particularly if you tell the truth, what you have really seen and experienced. To get through, very important and rare opportunities will have to enable you to discover the truth and, even so, many will still be doubting. The woman is possessed by a ghost who leads her to the truth. The victim, her husband, was a killing psychopath. But he had an accomplice and this one will try to clean up the plate and hide their crimes by getting rid of the possessed woman who saw and witnessed their crimes in her possession. The shortcoming of the film is that too many details are not rationally built. Possession is psychological and triggered by some knowledge you come to in a way or another. Then you see ghosts. But the main interest of the film is a criticism of psychiatry and psychiatrists. They do not listen to the possessed people they are supposed to help because these do not speak a rational language. So they close them up in their possession and doom them to perdition. It is also a strong advocacy that such possessed language is the reflection of reality and that reality and truth can be read in their stories, if we believe them and translate them into rational and clear language, not pseudo-scientific gibberish. Psychiatry is, by refusing to do that, a transcribed version of what the possessed say that justifies their exclusion and rejection but rejects at the same time the truth in their discourse. In other words psychiatry is a dead and fatal language that brings the possessed in line with the need for society not to listen to such « ranting and raving » from « criminals ». It is much easier to reject than to accept : to accept makes you question the sanity of society that is used by some as a screen to hide their own perversions.<br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUs COULARDEAU
B00005JKN9|1.0|I was really excited when this movie came out.  Instead what I saw was a three hour waste of time.  The stellar cast did well enough with what they had, but the script was not well written.  The movie jumps from plot to plot, with many unneccessary scenes.  And just when you think we've settled into a plot line for the rest of the movie, bam!  The actors are off with some new unplausible story.  The ending stretched for far too long, and was not a satisfying conclusion to the movie.  The elements were all there for movie of the century, but it didn't come anywhere near expectations.  The critics were so wrong this time.  You're not missing anything if you pass on this movie.
6305949972|5.0|The Story itself is a perverse well ending distortion of all festivities children love into a nightmare. Children adore Halloween, even though it is dedicated to wintry death, the ghostlike dead, sour witches, menacing wizards, all kinds of dangerous beings that only revel in the enjoyment of death for themselves and for everyone else. On the other hand Christmas has become the celebration of sweet gifts, sugary presents, honey-like offerings of love and friendship to children and to everyone we love and love can only exist in life. Or Can it really?<br /><br />Some sort of rivalry emerges in the minds of these Halloween monsters with Santa Claus and Christmas. So they use their great hero, Mr. Jack, to kidnap Santa Claus and to replace him with himself and his own presents that are necessarily obnoxious and disgusting and aggressive and ugly and repulsive, and many other things along these lines. He creates a real revolution in the world of the living who just pick up their weapons and start shooting and finally manage to bring that Mr. Jack and his sleigh down, but not down into their living world,  but down into the world of the dead, that is to say the world of Halloween.<br /><br />But down there a girl, in fact some kind of a rag doll made up of pieces sown together has fallen in love with this Mr. Jack, and sure enough her love is a long story of pain, suffering and pangs of fear and anguish. Mr. Jack does not see that love and is not even, interested in love. Mr. Jack is only thinking of how he could entertain his living dead community with some antics and pranks performed on the living that are not yet dead.<br /><br />But since a miracle is always possible, that miracle happens and Mr. Jack after having been shot down from the sky back into his cemetery and tomb comes up again in his ghoulish world and discovers they are on the point of killing both Santa Claus and the sweet rag doll that had tried to liberate Father Christmas who had not been able to escape. Strangely enough Mr. Jack has met with a real epiphany somewhere between the sky and his burying vault and he actually saves the day by sparing Santa Claus, giving him his sleigh and his rein-deers back and everything can go back to normal, or can it?<br /><br />The story is nothing that will last forever. The animated film, the animation itself, in other words the film in its visual dimension is a mind-stirring adventure. Tim Burton is an expert at transforming anything into its opposite and merging the two together and turning the most repulsive being into a real darling. Here he manages Mr. Jack who is like a human-looking daddy-long-legs into a real darling that becomes lovely and lovable when he is performing the worst practical jokes on children. This is possible because the only reaction of the living is to be afraid, to run away or to turn around and attack in order to kill. Why don’t the living take what they are given without forgetting that you must not look a gift horse in the mouth and you must enjoy the gift because any gift is always a sign of love and it comes from the heart.<br /><br />There is a nostalgic and melancholy tone in this film as if Tim Burton regretted the fact that living humans, that is to say all humans, cannot accept those who are different, the intentions of these beings, though they come from the heart even if they may be surprising. Human beings are so narrowly enshrined and engulfed and embalmed in their fear and limited normative world that they are no longer able to see what love is when it comes from someone who does not do it the same way as them. It is sad.<br /><br />The other marvelous fact is that the whole film is sung and accompanied by music. Danny Elfman has made a prodigious work in this film. Without the music the whole film would be so sad, so dark, so bloodless and spineless that it would not be able to stand up by itself. This Christmas story, after all, or Halloween story if you prefer, is just as sad asScrooge and yet with some sweet star light all along. Of course what’s more, like Tim Burton, Danny Elfman is a great borrower and you will recognize here and there some tit bits coming from far away and other films, other music, at times his own attached to some other film. It is discreet and no children can catch the nuggets, but with some experience we can and that just sounds fascinating.<br /><br />I am sure your grandchildren might like it, even if you may find it a little bit somber. Do not forget children always enjoy a trace of fear and a piece of supernatural emotion, just as much as they love a trace of sugar on their pastry and a piece of Turkish delight, even if it opens the door to Narnia.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUurse what’s more, like Tim Burton, Danny Elfman is a great borrower and you will recognize here and there some tit bits coming from far away and other films, other music, at times his own attached to some other film.

B0001BKAEY|4.0|Did this movie live up to the original Matrix?  No.  But then agian, what could.  Instead, what we get is the stunning conclusion to the trilogy.  Wonderful special effects add to this profound story of The One.  I was so excited to see this movie opening night, and it did not let me down.  Some people left confused, or disappointed, but I think the ending gave us all exactly what was necessary.  <br />We start off with the required explanations to the cliff-hanger of Reloaded.  Then we're off.  The story of our race desperately trying to save the last human city, and survive these relentless machines bent on our extinction, is a rush to the system.  Meanwhile, Trinity and Neo are off trying to save humanity with a seeminly foolish plan.  This explains all of the loose ends if you're able to see it.  And the ending?  The final confrontation between Neo and Agent Smith is greater than I could have hoped for.
B000002KO3|5.0|Sometimes, impulse buys are the best choices. Strolling around my favorite CD store, I realized I don't have a lot of Talking Heads albums. Heck, I don't have any at all. I knew a little bit about them (basically their cover of Al Green's &quot;Take Me to the River&quot;), and I had heard before that &quot;Remain in Light&quot; is their masterpiece. Because I'm not acquainted with the rest of their material, I am inclined to agree.<BR>This album is a very innovative new wave disc that dabbles in reggae and world music. David Byrne's hiccuping vocals are an acquired taste, but his lyrics are very strong, and the music is simply fantastic: bouncy, poppy, dancy (is that a word?), and yet brooding and haunting (the final three songs). Considering this was a 7 dollar purchase, it was very well spent. Magnificent album that every fan of 80s music should have to see it wasn't all just disposable pop.
B000002HHB|5.0|This cd is beautiful, mellow, uplifting.... every song is perfect.   This is my very favorite of all of Natalie's work, and I have them all!
B000003TAL|4.0|Another out-of-the-blue impulse buy based on hype, I am still somewhat on the fence with this album. Whereas I think their texturing of guitar sounds is quite inspiring, some sections of the songs tend to stray too far out of focus. And yes, Kim Gordon's &quot;riot grrl&quot; vocal intonations...*shudder* However, there is tons to like on this album because SY still remembers how to create some fantastic song structures, and a lot of the textures are fun to listen to. I try not to look too deep into what people say and just enjoy listening to the album as a work of music. Imagine that perspective!
B00005JMJ4|3.0|I read all the accolades for this movie, then I watchged it.  I don't know why all the reviews say it's funny, because I didn't laugh once during the film, and wouldn't call it a comedy at all. Well, I DID find the lyrics to the song that was sung in the strip club (NOT a prostitute scebe, hich was stated in another review) were just plain silly, along with a goofy melody.<br />On a side note, the strippers were old and ugly, and not representative of the true beauty of japanese women.  <br />As much as I loved Murray in &quot;Ground Hog Day,&quot; I just am not excited by this film.  Rent it first before deciding to buy.<br />The DVD extra behind the scenes is nice, though and really shows how hard the cast/crew worked, along with some candid moments of Bill being Bill.  I will agree with what one Japanese crew member said:  Ms. Johansson and Ms. Coppola are &quot;cool&quot; and &quot;yasashii.&quot;
B000000W5L|5.0|In between making pacts with Satan, injecting/snorting/smoking every conceivable drug, and having sex with thousands of women, the Stones made some great music. They were revolting, yes, and their great album might have been the work of the devil, but it was great music nevertheless. Their run from \\"Beggars Banquet\\" to this album was a tremendous period that saw some brilliant songs come to light.<BR>After the more tame \\"Sticky Fingers\\", the Stones got to work and made what every huge band needs at least one of: a sloppy, uneven, brilliant double album. The Beatles did it, Jimi did it, Dylan did it, and in 1972, the Stones did it. \\"Exile on Main Street\\" is gritty, raunchy, and chock-full of brilliant, over-looked songs. That it doesn't have a stand-out song of a caliber like \\"Gimmie Shelter\\" or \\"Wild Horses\\" makes this album stand out even more as a complete album instead a few good songs and tons of filler. It's messy and raw, but it's also inspired.

B00001OH7P|5.0|David Bowie's arrogant excursion into concept albums paid off handsomely with &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;. Five years before the end of the earth, a space-travelling rock star called Ziggy Stardust and his band the Spiders from Mars, came to this planet to rock out. Ziggy played fantastic songs, became famous, and Ziggy killed himself. Hmmm, interesting correlation between Ziggy and Kurt Cobain? Or is that just me...<BR>David Bowie has had a long career of making fantastic albums, and though this album is his most well-known, it isn't necessarily the best one. However, there is no disputing the fantastic rock/glam/pop songs that Bowie was writing at his zenith (remember, he was producing Iggy Pop's &quot;Raw Power&quot; and Lou Reed's &quot;Transformer&quot; at this time). An essential part of rock history that spawned countless imitators, but never an equal. Don't lean on him man, cuz you can't afford the ticket.
0780020693|5.0|This film has all the trademark Fellini tracking shots and surrealism, but what makes it so enjoyable to me is the rude humor. One reviewer said, \\"lewd and bawdy.\\" Exactly. Shots from behind as women place their derrieres on bicycle seats almost made me wet myself. Il Duce and the Fascists are made to look ridiculous. A grandfather who amuses himself with flatulence. A mad Uncle Teo who refuses to unzip while urinating, then climbs a tree and won't come down, while screaming, \\"I need a woman.\\" A group of boys masturbating together in a car while verbalizing the sexual images that are in their heads. A boy who proves his worthiness by lifting an over-weight tobacconist, then plunges his face into her ample bossom as his reward. It all makes me squeal with delight.<br />In the film's most haunted and surreal image, some of the townsfolk go out at night in small boats to witness the passing of the luxury liner, The Rex. The liner floats by as if in a dream, and will delight lovers of FILM ART. Beautiful.<br />Don't miss the FUNNIEST and most BEAUTIFUL foreign film to come down the pike. I like it better than 8 1/2 and consider this Fellini's MASTERPIECE. WONDERFUL STUFF from a TRUE AUTEUR.
B0001AP12G|4.0|Kanye West is here to stay. An in-demand producer ever since he lent opulent soul to Jay-Z certified classic &quot;Blueprint&quot;, he finally gets behind the mic on his debut album. An album that spans 21 tracks with several skits over 74 minutes (a full 12 of them spent talking about his left since he started getting some cred) can never be solid all the way through, but the disparate elements just make West's exceptional mic skills and innovative production shine that much brighter. It is also true testament to his skills that he makes supposed superstars like Jay-Z and Ludacris sound ragged and fat compared to his hungry delivery.<br />His lyrics are also fantastic: the second verses of &quot;Jesus Walks&quot; and &quot;Through the Wire&quot; are some of the best rhymes committed to tape in several years. While he gets bogged down with masochistic cliches at times, his commitment to religion and family erases those bad tastes. Kanye West is a rare talent in the hip-hop community, mixing panache, insight, humor and arrogance in his rhymes, and his production is the sharpest behind innovators like the Neptunes and Timbaland. &quot;The College Dropout&quot; will make appearances on several year-end lists come December, and will be remembered as a flawed photograph of a very talented artist during his rise to his peak.
B00005NRO3|5.0|I'm amazed at how great this movie was. We know that Billy is dead but another copycat shows up right after the premire of Stab which was about the original Scream. It introduced Cotton Weary the man who went to jail for murdering Sidney's mother. He was to eager to get his fifteen minutes of fame. Also back was Dewey, Gail, and Randy. I was suprised that Dewey didn't bring up the fact that his sister was dead. I liked Randy a lot because he knew a lot about horror movies but sadly he died. Dewey really can take a punch I thought he had died in the first one. Gail really changed and she started caring about other people for a change. This movie was great and it is a must see for all horror fans.
B000005IU2|5.0|The precursor to punk rock? Back in 1970 when this album was released, it had a very limited following that has increased as time revealed the album as the sloppy, chaotic seed of punk rock and a rock masterpiece. Slow, thudding, stoopid, this album is a love-it-or-hate-it proposition. Let Iggy stick it deep inside.
B00018D44U|3.0|Still trying very hard to warm up to Norah Jones. She is undoubtedly extremely talented--both her pipes and her piano playing. However, the tunes are simply boring. Many of them are painfully similar. More power to her if she can continue selling millions of cds with this formula.
B00007FOMP|5.0|Marvin Gaye's 1971 classic &quot;What's Going On&quot; is a tremendous R&amp;B album that every self-respecting fan of the genre should have. What makes this album so great is its uncompromising history: Berry Gordy wanted more up-beat songs from Marvin, and received the title track, which lamented the wasteful war in Vietnam. Gordy was horrified and almost refused to release it. Of course, the song became a huge hit in the US thanks to increasing awareness about societal problems, and now Marvin had to record an entire album to supplement the single.<BR>The entire album took an intense 10 days to record, but you could never tell by the languid flow it possesses. This album is dense with rhythm and melody, and flows together like a single song suite, making it a must-listen all the way through in one sitting. What's also great about the album is that its messages still hold true today. We still face problems that Marvin saw the US face 30 years ago: a needless war, problems with the environment, and social problems across inner cities in the US. Marvelous music, uplifting message, this is truly a classic album.
2913903878|5.0|This book is an excellent reference guide for beginning collectors of militaria items issued during World War II to U.S. Army soldiers in the European of Theater Operation (ETO).   <br />This book is a must have if you are going to be purchasing your items from online sources such as EBAY and surplus stores.  This book will absolutely help you identify authentic U.S. Army issued items.  This is very important given the explosion of modern day reproduction of many of these same items now being sold commercially.    <br />This large(Literally)sized book is comprised of numerous detailed colored photographs accompanied with brief written descriptions of each article of issue.  I very much liked the layout of this book; it is well organized in a logical manner starting with Insignia and Decorations, moving through to Uniforms, Equipment and Weapons.  I especially liked the specialized sections for Armored Troops, Airborne Troops, Mountain Troops, Female Personnel, and Military Police.  The author also included special sections for The Corps of Engineers and Signal Corp.  I also enjoyed the (seldom seen) sections dealing with Army Rations, Army Publications and Personal Items. I found this format to be easily used to locate the items I was interested in and compare the large photographs in the book to items I was planning on purchasing online.<br />This book is very reasonably priced compared to other military collector books such as \\"Doughboy to GI\\" and does not contained a lot of information I do not need anyway , but  end up paying for with other military collectors books.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is Among the best Sci-Fi TV programs that was out there. The creators and actors did an amazing job with this show. The interaction of the characters in the show created an amazing story line that captured me right off with the first battle scene. I wish that they could have continued with this series as I would have loved to watch this show along with all my other favorites. I've already watched the DVDs twice. I'll watch it again as I'll be over seas in Afghanistan.
B000089RVX|4.0|I'm in my 40's and never thought I'd even listen to this type of music, but it so aptly defines my life.  I lost the love of my life, my husband, when he suddenly died 10 months ago. Dark it is, but some of us really live that life. For those who say the lyrics are middle school or high school, well, they've just been fortunate to have never suffered any real loss or pain. Her voice is powerful. I cannot listen to this CD without crying, which is why I only listen in the car...
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This album is truly fantastic and it's filled to the brim with catchy, fun pop music!  It's by far Britney's most consistent album and I can easily listen to it without skipping a single track.  My favorites include Breathe on Me, Toxic, and Touch of My Hand.  I never imagined Britney would ever make quality songs such as these, but I was definitely proven wrong!  I recommend this album to anyone who enjoys pop music because it's simply the best of its genre, bar none!  There's no comparing this album to any of Britney's previous work or any recent pop albums, it's just that good!  Pick this up without any hesitation!!
B000003CMB|5.0|If you wondered why Duane Allman was voted the second greatest guitarist after Jimi Hendrix in Rolling Stones'recent poll,this album explains it all.The standard for all rock live albums.With 35 years of highs and lows,the Allman Brothers Band may have never been better than they were here in March of 1971.A must have for blues fans especially.Pure genius.
0743482883|3.0|I am a major Linda Howard fan and have almost all of her novels.  This book I actually found to be very monotonous. The various characters did not \\"click\\" for me like they usually do in a Linda Howard book.  I found the characters tedious and one-dimensional, the story line absurd and I knew who the killer was immediately.  Would I recommend this book?  If you are a Linda Howard fan and have come to expect a certain quality in her stories, I would say skip this one.      Jaine and three of her co-workers devise \\"the list\\" of the perfect man while having drinks at a bar one night.  This list somehow makes it way from their table to work to the internet and finally makes them overnight hits on local tv shows, etc.  At the same time Jaine has moved into her new home which she loves except for her grouchy next door neighbor who we later learn is a cop.    Once her friends start dying and they figure out its because of the list, its up to Sam to keep Jaine safe.      I never have high expectations for plots when reading a romance.  It's all about the romance, but the characters in this story were more annoying then anything.
B000002JK2|5.0|This is one great album.Not a bum track to be found.Some of Petes finest songwriting in a long time,and the marvelous singing and soul of the sorely missed Ronnie Lane moves me every time.&quot;Annie&quot;,&quot;April Fool&quot; some of his best.Wouldn't it have been great if &quot;My Baby Gives it Away&quot; had gotten the full Who treatment? I could hear Roger Daltry rip thru this one.&quot;Heart to Hang Onto&quot;is one of Townshends greatest songs,with heartbreaking vocals.Get this one! Ronnie Lane is reason enough.
B00000JCOV|5.0|Alright, if you don't get this album I am going to be pissed, Slipknot is back, Anders is gone and Corey Taylor of Stone Sour and Joey Jordison of The MurderDolls, this band is unbelievaley good, their is some amazing nu-metal songs that are to good to compete with anything else(SIC) and songs that are new to metal that are going to rip you off your feet(SPIT IT OUT) and there are some great songs you just can't describe(WAIT AND BLEED) This band has been around since 1995, and I doubt they'l be together much longer, so you need to get this album NOW!!! Don't hesitate!
B0000AMRJC|4.0|The movie &quot; Scarface&quot; is derected by Brian De Palma. Scarfase is about a Cuban refugee who builds a powerful cocaine empire throudh a ruthless reign of ultra violence and business savvy.The main character in this film is Tony Montana who believes that &quot;first you get the money, then you get the power and then you get the woman&quot;. In the end it all goes up in a hell of bullets and hallfire: Tony Montana was a man so obsessed with the American dream, that he did not realize it had consumed him in every way possible.<BR>   The film &quot;Scarface &quot; was very interesting but on the other hand it was scary to watch because there were a lot of actions that involved  killing,robbing  and a lot of money.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This movie is about mood and about the unexpected nature of life. It is about disappointment with what we have and longing for what we want.  It is about sitting in a hotel bar, surrounded by strangers, in a city where you don't know a single sole.  The beauty of this movie is that we see that there is hope within this lonliness, there is the potential for human connection and that that the world is really not that big afer all. If these are emotions you can't understand, don't see this movie.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|&quot;Lost In Translation&quot; is actually a pretty good movie, if you like the &quot;friendship&quot; kind of movie.  The idea is genius, I think.  But for some it isn't all that great and it's easy to see why for some.  But some movies I go see for the soul purpose of enjoying it.<br />Perhaps the reason why not so many seem to like it here is because of all the hype.  It happens to the best of movies that receive a lot of hype (The Matrix Reloaded comes to mind). Lost In Translation DID receive a lot of hype, with an oscar nominee for Best Picture, Director, Actor and Screenplay, it generated a lot of hype and made a lot of people want to go out and see this movie. Well, hype tends to disappoint people and so I tried to view the movie with as litle expectations as possible, and to my surprise, it worked.<br />Bill Murray plays a man named Bob Harris who flies off to Toyko to shoot a commercial.  His wife and kids are back in a America while he goes to Toyko to shoot this commercial. Scarlet Johansen plays the wife of a world-wide photographer who is in Toyko on business.<br />The two meet in a bar in Toyko and soon become friends. Perhaps what really IS interesting about the movie is their age difference. Bill Murray is a middle-aged man and Scarlet Johansen is young.  So the chemistry is in fact odd.<br />The characters are stale though.  We don't learn much about them and actually that symbolizes just what the movie IS. Both of our protagonists are lonely mentally and that's what &quot;Lost In Translation&quot; is all about.<br />Then there's the plot... well the movie doesn't really have a plot.  However, a movie doesn't have to present a plot to be good. As long as the story unfolds in a believeable and interesting way, it can more than make up for the lack of an actual plot.<br />My gripes with the movie. I may not live in Toyko but it seems the movie is full of stereotypes!  The fact that they show Japanese as not being able to speak as well of English and the whole bit about them not being as tall as westerners is nothing but stereotypes!  I don't mind that they joked around but its the fact that well...the movie wasn't really funny at all.  They call this a comedy but its not.<br />Lost in Translation isn't a bad movie, it's just been given to much hype which utterly ruins the experience of the movie.  It's a great film and Bill Murry gives one of the best performances ever.

B00005U8EM|5.0|I will always have a special place in my heart for &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;. it's not only one of my favorite movies of all time, but it was what started my true appreciation for the talent of Bill Murray. It's hard to imagine anyone else being able to pull off a movie like this, where he has to continuely relive the same day and situations again and again. His character of Phil the weatherman, in town to cover the annual Groundhog Day festival in Pa., goes from being an egomaniacal jerk, to a kind, sweet man...no longer doing good deeds just to impress his producer, Rita (McDowell), but because he wants to.  The scene where Phil confesses his true feelings to a sleeping Rita, will always remain one of the sweetest, most touching romantic moments in film.<br />The film works on every level, and was the first (but not last) great film of Bill Murray's career.
B000001F3C|5.0|This third album from U2 is a great improvement over their first two albums which sounded very raw and rather dry in their production.<br /> While still raw, this CD has a much better sound than those two and deservedly propelled U2 into the spotlight.<br /> My favorite songs are &quot;New Year's Day&quot;, &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; and &quot;Drowning Man&quot; which are among the best songs of U2's early. Even over 20 years after first hearing them, these three songs still give me the chills with their cold yet edgy sound and pleading vocals.<br /> This may not their best album but &quot;War&quot; was a much-needed improvement over their two previous albums and should be included in any U2 fans collection. &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot; takes another quantum leap forward which would be their best album to date. Everything else from there was leaps and bounds for me.
6301969294|5.0|While it was based on Ayn Rand's book, Ayn Rand personally altered the story to adapt it to film.  It is a great movie that really makes the viewer think about many things including individualism, selfishness, and even what is right and wrong.  For many people who take these notions as given from a very young, questioning them with an adult mind is a good idea.  If you enjoy this movie, be sure to pick up and read some of Ayn Rand's non-fiction.
B00005N91B|5.0|This movie is indeed now a cult classics. Sharon Stone stole the show. The way she looks, stirs and gazes, the confidence she exludes while talking to her victims  totally spellbinds the viewer. This is one of the best thrillers of the century. Nice work sharon!!
B00005V1B2|5.0|Camel are one of the most overlooked progressive bands in the world, probably because their music is mostly instrumental - this cd is a fair example, and their songs are not catchy. What a shame that most people ignore this great band. I've always preferred them to others from the progressive field like Yes (Jon Anderson's voice always grated on my nerves, sorry).<br />The Snow Goose is simply one of Camel's major achievements.  The title had to be slightly changed to 'Music inspired by....' to prevent legal actions by Paul Gallico, who wrongly assumed Camel were involved with the tobacco company. The stuff here is based on this book though. <br />The songs (Most of them pretty short) follow the narrative, and none of them is a throwaway. The bonus tracks featured are nice too, even if it's hard sometimes to tell the differences with the former release. The songs taken from the Marquee are outstanding like in the other Camel reeditions.
B00018D44U|3.0|its very good news that artists such as MS JONES are making waves in the record industry and attaining the success that they so richly deserve,success it should be added,on talent and not on how little amount of clothing they can you wear.There is nothing here that is groundbreaking or fantastically remarkable but NORAH has captured the 'pleasant'market, music that is not taxing ,just very very 'nice'to listen to.She plays all the selections here with aplomb and its a cosy 46 minutes of ,for want of a better phrase, 'easy listening'occasionally veering into the dreaded 'MOR'.Her first offering was pleasant and this is too.Guaranteed to soothe your cares away thats our MS JONES<BR>and in these times of ours thats not a bad thing at all.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|&quot;Lost In Translation&quot; is a film that moves along at a slow, almost dreamlike pace. The characters often do not speak, but instead are shown observing their often confusing foreign surroundings. while this may seem boring to some, it's a joy to watch for those patient enough to adjust to the extremely talented Sofia Coppola's style of storytelling.<br />Shot in just 27 days on a small scale budget, &quot;Lost...&quot; is beautifully filmed, with the city of Tokyo and it's residents front and center in this quiet little film. But it's the unlikely love story that leaves the biggest impression. Bill Murray and Scarlet Johannson are an unlikely pair of Americans (she along with her photographer husband on an assignment, he as a slightly washed up actor pitching wiskey) who stumble upon each other, and when each suffers from insomnia, begin to explore the city together. The romance, is sweet and in keeping with the rest of the story...very subtle. And while the ending may leave you frustrated, you ultimately realize it was the only way it COULD have ended.<br />Both Murray and Johannson do a fantastic job of bringing their characters to life. and Murray, especially in the last scenes of the film, is able to convey so much... with just a glance or a gesture.  It's an amazingly effecting performance, and definitely his best work to date.<br />The extras found on the DVD are wonderful as well. The behind the scenes footage shot during the filming, is especially entertaining. My favorite moment is seeing Coppola as excited as a little girl on Christmas morning just knowing that Murray is in Tokyo, and her crying when she realizes her dream of making the movie is coming true.<br />&quot;Lost In Translation&quot; proves that sometimes less is more.
0385504209|5.0|Almost everyone I knew was reading this book so I thought I would see what all the fuss was about.  I AM GLAD I DID.  I was so enthralled by this book that I could not put it down, and when I had to, I could not wait to get back to it.  It is an intellectual and imaginative roller coaster ride.  This book fascinated me so much that I would go on-line to further explore some of the ideas presented.<br />This book exposed me to theories I had not known about art history, the Holy Grail, mathematics and more.  I admit, ordinarily topics like art history and mathematics put me to sleep but NOT THIS BOOK.  This is the kind of book that intrigues you, gets you thinking, makes you re-examine what you've taken for the truth, teaches you new theories and does it all in the context of an extraordinary murder mystery.<br />Whether you believe all of the theories presented in this book or only some of them is up to you.  I took comfort in that fact that the pendulum IS swinging.  As a human race we are starting to sense the dangers of our history and of our destructive paths.  We are beginning to sense the need to restore the sacred feminine.
B000024D4R|5.0|&quot;Animals&quot; was the 4th Pink Floyd album I bought after &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, &quot;The Wall&quot;, and &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;.  I remember the first time I listened to it, I couldn't &quot;get it&quot; as seeing 2 tracks that were barely over a minute long along with 3 songs all over 10 minutes bewildered me.<br />But one day, I had to drive about 60 miles and I was really enjoying DSOTM and WYWH, so I decided to give &quot;Animals&quot; another chance.  I am glad that I did that!  For whatever reason, listening to it again that day made me see this album in a completely different light!  It got to the point that I had to listen to this album once a week, and now it is my favorite Pink Floyd album that I own out of 8 (growing each week) of their albums.<br />If you love guitar driven songs and great guitar solos, then you will love this album.  Some of the solos that Gilmour has in &quot;Dogs&quot; will literally make the hair on the back of your neck stand up.  Although Rick Wright didn't write any of the songs, he plays a major role on this album with his keyboard playing (arguably his best playing was on this album). Roger Waters' bass playing and Nick Mason's drumming churns along and fits perfectly with Gilmour's guitar playing and Wright's keyboards.<br />As you probably read from other reviews, this album was a concept one and &quot;loosely&quot; based on George Orwell's Animal Farm.  &quot;Pigs on the Wing, Part 1&quot; is really the same song as &quot;Pigs on the Wing, Part 2&quot; with slightly different lyrics and it bookends the album.  &quot;Dogs&quot; was actually a Floyd song that was performed on the Dark Side of the Moon tour and was known as &quot;You Gotta Be Crazy&quot; but Waters along with Gilmour re-worked it and re-named it &quot;Dogs&quot;.  Same thing with &quot;Sheep&quot; as it too was played on the DSOTM tour but was known as &quot;Raving and Drooling&quot;.  Only &quot;Pigs (Three Different Ones)&quot; wastruly a &quot;new&quot; song.  Speaking of which, Gilmour's guitar playing in that one is one of extreme crunch, listen to his solo at the last one and a half minute of that song.  It is the heaviest I have ever heard him play - the riff reminds me of something I would hear from Randy Rhoades.<br />You have to remember that these were not happy times for the band.  Roger Waters' ego was seriously getting out of control and Rick Wright was going through marriage problems.  Yet, despite all their troubles, the band was able to put out an undisputed masterpiece - one that will never get its due as it had the misfortune of falling in between &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; and &quot;The Wall&quot;.  Nonetheless, ask many Floyd fans what their favorite album by the band is, and this one is normally mentioned in the same breath as of &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; and &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;.  I would get DSOTM and WYWH first, but then quickly move onto this powerful album (definitely get this before &quot;The Wall&quot; - something I wished I had done as it makes &quot;The Wall&quot; a better listen).  Just give it a couple of listens and don't be put off by the long 3 songs.  Also, remember that &quot;Dogs&quot; is the greatest rock song ever written.  Period.
B000002UUX|5.0|I've heard 6 of Megadeth's albums and this is definetely the best. All the songs on this album are excellent, there are no bad ones to speak of. The guitar work is great and extremely fast (Mustaine and Friedman must be two of the best guitarists there are) and it is melodic at times yet still very heavy. For anybody just getting into these guys I'd recommend either this, &quot;Youthanasia&quot; or &quot;Countdown To Extinction&quot;, all three are awesome. Stand out songs are definetely &quot;Holy Wars... The Punishment Due&quot;, &quot;Tornado Of Souls&quot; and &quot;Rust In Peace... Polaris&quot;. If you have heard any of Megadeth and like it, then definetely pick this one up, it's easily one of the best albums I own.
068983571X|4.0|Sherlock Holmes, just the mere mention of his name strikes fear into the hearts of criminals, but what is especially great about this book, is that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle doesn't let the reader know that Holmes is in the book until the end portion.  What that does for the reader which I enjoyed a lot, was that it let the reader try to figure the mystery instead of with the help of a detective extraordinaire.<br /> The mystery begins in London in 1989 with Holmes and Watson examining a cane.  From the very beginning, it is easy to understand that Watson is no skilled detective but is a dramatic foil for Holmes, meaning he outlines Holmes' character by being his opposite.  While inspecting the cane, a man named Mortimer walks in and makes it known to Holmes' and Watson about the Baskerville curse.  The curse came about when Hugo Baskerville, an ancestor to Sir Henry made a deal with the Devil to let him find a girl he fell in love with.  The girl had run away, and when he went to look for her in the moor, both he and the girl were found dead.  The next heir to his estate, Charles, was also killed from the monstrous hound, leaving only one heir left, Henry.  Holmes gives the case to Watson and tells Watson to update him frequently.  As Watson watches over Sir Henry, he gains information slowly about the people living in Baskerville Hall, one couple the Barrymores, provided some suspicion, with their late night endeavors with someone out over the moor.  Another couple, the Stapeltons, who were brother and sister, was also considered to have ties to the death of Charles and to the demon hound.  An escaped convict also plays an important role in the mystery as to giving Watson and Holmes some clues about the murders.  At what appears to be the climax, Holmes reveals to Watson that he has been on the case and at Baskerville Hall, in Devonshire, the entire time.  He also shatters all of Watson's theories about the case and tells Watson who the real culprit is.  But the story is not over yet, as Holmes, Watson, and Sir Henry devise a plan to capture the culprit in the act, but a thick fog throws a monkey wrench into the plan and results in Sir Henry's encounter with the glowing, fire-breathing cursed hound of the Baskervilles.<br /> Overall, I enjoyed the book very much, and this is saying much since I hate to read.  What I especially liked about the book is the fact that Doyle threw so many possible suspects into the plot, but only one of them had anything to do with the mystery.  That coupled with the fact that Watson, a mediocre detective, was on the case lets the readers logically run through the possibilities instead having Sherlock Holmes just give the answer away.  The plot was developed very well with many cliffhangers which kept me wanting to read more.  All in all, the only thing I didn't like about the book was the fact that the murderer was given away well before the end of the book. This was done at the time Sherlock Holmes was reintroduced.  But Doyle well more than made up for it, by adding an intense finish to the book that kept me guessing as to the outcome.  This book was definitely written to appease to the desires of those who enjoy murder mysteries and for those who like to be able to solve the case based on gathering information and putting it back together to form a logical explanation of the events.is not over yet, as Holmes, Watson, and Sir Henry devise a plan to capture the culprit in the act, but a thick fog throws a monkey wrench into the plan and results in Sir Henry's encounter with the glowing, fire-breathing cursed hound of the Baskervilles.<BR> Overall, I enjoyed the book very much, and this is saying much since I hate to read.

B0001AP12G|5.0|Kanye says he's all about message and melody, and he proves it on this spectacular disc. Every track reflects his masterful skills as a producer and the lyrics range from hard-hitting commentary to bitingly funny satire. The tracks that didn't make this CD (check the Kanye website to hear a couple) could make an entire CD on their own.
B0000B0WVQ|5.0|im no music critic. this album is amazing. i am totally 100 percent backing this album. i have not been this impressed with a cd in such a long time. i actually got chills the first time I heard &quot;Gone Under Sea&quot; and I have no idea what she's singing about!!! I cannot sit still to &quot;On Parade&quot;, almost cry to &quot;Birds&quot; and put &quot;You Make Me Weak At The Knees&quot; on all my mix cds. (in fact 2 cuts from this cd have made it onto every mix cd i have made in the past couple months)<BR>p.s. the band is nice even, they personally responded to my email! you gotta love talented and nice musicians!!!<BR>Electrelane for President!!!=)
B000069HZP|3.0|Michael Douglas is Nicholas Van Orton, a not very likeable, rather unscrupulous bigshot investment banker (with echoes of the character he played in `Wall Street'). His troubled brother Conrad (Sean Penn) offers him as birthday present, a chance to play the `Game' on offer from an outfit calling itself `Consumer Recreation Services'. Intrigued but so far not very impressed, Van Orton visits the CRS offices and is subjected to several hours of psychometric testing. Then odd stuff starts to happen. A toy clown turns up in front of his house with a key in its mouth. A newsreader on TV breaks off reading the news and engages him in conversation. A man collapes in the street and when Van Orton helps he is taken along in the ambulance to..., well, somewhere quite frightening that is certainly not a hospital. <br />This is the movie David Fincher made in between `Seven' and `Fight Club'. Like `Fight Club' it's a very interesting movie that fails to live up to the promise suggested by `Seven'. In fact it is like `Fight Club' in other ways too. Like `Fight Club' it starts out well, with a really interesting first half. Here we are set up with a delightfully intriguing mystery: here is Van Orton caught up in this utterly baffling nightmare; what on earth is going on? Are these guys out to destroy him? If so why? And why go about it in such a perversely elaborate way? And if not, what on earth are they doing? But, exactly as with `Fight Club' a really satisfying first half is followed by a really silly second half. The movie just tries to be too clever, and slowly starts to disappear up its own backside. Then, having got us all excited with a lovely intriguing mystery, it cops out with the most feeble and unconvincing of denouements. So after one hour, you are sat there thinking, \\"Hey, what an interesting, fresh, original movie\\"; but after two and a bit, as the credits roll, you are sat there thinking: \\"How disappointing, all a bit silly, hopelessly unbelievable and a seriousletdown after first hour.\\"
B00009V8Z9|5.0|There is so much crap out there today, and then there are albums like this. Possibly the best out there right now.

1582432678|1.0|As a graduate of Saint Leo College's Criminology program, I am attracted to crime writing like a magnet.  Some crime writers have a God given gift for getting inside the criminal's head.  Some of my favorites are Ann Rule, Jack Olson, James Pruitt, and especially Don Pendleton.  Lionel Shriver is one of the least creative crime writers to ever enter the craft.<br />She created a collection of fictional letters that chronicle a mother's life throughout her motherhood.  The fact that her son happens to be a convicted mass murderer comes out as incidental.<br />Shriver should have devoted ten times more material to Kevin's psycho-pathology, cut out all the daily grind, and left out the mother's unimportant observations on life.<br />Shriver's letter writer needs a Carl Roger's type sounding board instead of a reader looking to be entertained.  Shriver doesn't pay me by the hour!
0446677450|1.0|Many of the points of this book are based on false information.  It is astounding that even his CPA associate missed some of the mistakes in here.  This book tells you how great investing is and hardly any non-obvious information on the subject.  Just pages of cheerleading, like all his books.  He won't reveal how much his personal success is because he says people are always out there to sue rich people out of their money.  However, he's writing books claiming how successful he is.  This is a real good collection of information on the author:<br />...<br />He does, however, have a good ideas on keeping an optimistic attitude.  If you want to read about money, read Peter Lynch or one of the other proven greats.  I wouldn't want a guy who can tell a good story on how to get rich actually teach me.  <br />Oh, one other interesting thing is that \\"Rich Dad\\" never really existed.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|this movie is pretty sweet, i think they wrapped up the triology the best way possible. people who are not really into the first to movies will most definetly not enjoy revolutions. on the otherhand, i can't understand why these reviews are filled with flamers of this movie that claim to be fans of the first two movies. i belive this movie is more deserving of a 4/5 stars but i gave it 5 to help tip the balance (even though it wont really do anything).
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Not only have I seen Gavin perform live but I also met him after one of his concerts. His performance live is AMAZING, its so energetic and the music is wonderful, his voice is terrific, I LOVE all the songs, he is just the Best performer live... the songs are better live than on the real cd, so it is definitely WORTH your money to see him live!!He was also quite funny during his concert, which actually took place on his birthday. He sang songs such as &quot;Lets get it on&quot; by marvin gaye and a few other songs not from the album, and no matter what he sings, it will sound soo good and everyones just singing with him. The best concert ever! A great performer/singer/pianist/guitarist/CD.. Go buy it today!
B000002MP2|5.0|Green Day's snotty punk masterpiece Dookie, light and super- catchy tunes with a few more mature songs (&quot;She&quot; and &quot;When I Come Around&quot;, namely) thrown in to show some depth. Green Day, a Clash-inspired punk band with a singer that was the voice for thousands of neurotic jokester punks  out there, would later influence other punk/pop bands like Blink-182. If you're looking for one of the essential '90s punk records, look no further. I love this album and couldn't live without it.<br />1. Burnout: 4.5/5 This song is just about being a loser that refuses to grow up. There's a good drum solo near the end also, and it represents Green Day in a nutshell. <br />2. Having a Blast: 4/5 Having a Blast is a tale of a man with dynamite taped to him about to kill people. One of Green Day's darker songs on Dookie.<br />3. Chump: 3.5/5 Arguably the weakest song on Dookie. It doesn't say much, and all it really does is lead into Longview, a much superior song to this one.<br />4. Longview 5/5 I love this song, and the lyrics ae hilarious. Many people see this different ways, but I see it as a song about general boredness that we try to cure by TV. The guitar is more obvious than in other songs, and the bass feels just right in this song.<br />5. Welcome to Paradise 4.5/5 Another good song that just captures the spirit of Green Day in general. It's also played a lot on the radio, as well as Longview. Definitely worth a look.<br />6. Pulling Teeth 4.5/5 This is a really funny song. If you listen to the lyrics, you'll hear how it's about a violent girlfriend. Green Day somehow makes a funny song about something that's kind of sad.<br />7. Basket Case 5/5 This is just like my anthem. I love the guitar at the beginning, and Billie Joe's singing is perfect on this one. A love song to the neurotic punks who were rocking out to this awesome song. One of Dookie's highlights.<br />8. She 5/5 Another great song, but this is a serious one. Billy Joe Armstrong croons quietlyas he tells about a girl who's in a bad relationship with suprising maturity. There's not much in terms of lyrics, but that's OK. A sleeper on this album.<br />9. Sassafras Roots 4/5 This song is okay. As the vocals continually point out, this is just about wasting your time. The vocals get a little annoying, but the bass and drums sound good on this one.<br />10. When I Come Around 5/5 Either this or Basket Case count as my favorite Dookie song. It's another mature song, with Billy apologizing to breaking the heart of a nameless girl. It's really catchy and I get it stuck in my head like every day along with Basket Case. I love the vocals, the lyrics, the catchy bass, the guitar, and the drums-h***, I just love this song.<br />11.Coming Clean 4.5/5 Good song. It has catchy drums and tells of a story of a boy becoming a man. The picture in the lyrics booklet says it all: a skeleton in a closet.<br />12. Emenius Sleepius 4/5 I don't like this song too much, but it's ok. There's not much to say about it.<br />Sorry I didn't talk about In the End and F.O.D, but I'm running out of space.And the hidden track is hilarious. You've gotta hear it at least once. Buy this with Nirvana's Nevermind and Rancid's ...And Out Come the Wolves for the maximum '90s punk effect.
B00005JMEW|1.0|Blood, blood and more blood. Fighting, fighting and more fighting. Maybe the fans like it, but I'm so old fasion that I want to have a plot in a film to like it. If you like gore this is your film, but I don't like it.
B000002KON|5.0|This album has got at all!<br />Great songs. Great playing. Great lyrics. Interesting story. Good production. Plenty of bonus-tracks.<br />Of course &quot;Shangrila&quot; is the oustanding track.<br />But there are no weak songs here.<br />&quot;Some Mother`s Son&quot; is very moving - could be an anti-war anthem!<br />&quot;Young and Innocent Days&quot; - beautiful sentimental Davies ballad.<br />Energy in the rockers &quot;Brainwashed&quot;, &quot;Victoria&quot; and &quot;Nothing to Say&quot;<br />Lots of humour and satire throughout the album.<br />Among the bonus tracks you`ll find some af Dave Davies` best songs from this period, &quot;This Man He Weeps Tonight&quot; and &quot;Mindless Child of Motherhood&quot; as well as the previously unreleased &quot;Mr Shoemaker`s Daughter&quot; from Dave`s aborted 1969 album!<br />This album deserves to be in any  record collection.
B00011RPB0|4.0|This is one of my personal best film I have seen in recent years. Although it is categorized as a comedy film, it is low-key and melancholic film (as you could see with the DVD package Bill Murray's face and posture). In the end of the film I had the strange feeling of both happiness and sadness - I ended up being melancholic.<br />I wished Bill Murray would take the best actor's title at the oscars, because his acting were so natural i couldn't even notice that he was acting.<BR>I also loved Charlotte (by Scarlette Johansson), I do find this lost girl quite attractive. Other actors were pretty good too, I think.<br />The Race issue - I'm a Japanese myself and I did not feel that this portrayed any racism towards Japanese people.  It is true that Japanese people generally can't speak English - it took me 3 months out of Japan to get rid of the problem of mixing \\"L\\" and \\"R\\" in English pronounciation. Lot of things about Japan/Japanese in the film happens in real life, and it can be funny and strange when you're not used to the culture.<br />I never new that hype was surrounding this film, I saw the ad once and I knew I had to go and see it. For anyone looking for any excitement or exaggurated humour, you won't find it here. You will be disappointed as later part of the film seems quite boring (ie the Kyoto scene and onwards). However, it was beautifully shot all throughout the film and it told a lot of things.<br />I would recommend this film to people who are getting fed up with popular films with extravaganza & spectacles (not that they are bad). I also hope that people who might not be interested in this sort of quiet film, might rent it and see if they might enjoy it. Give it a go.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|Every moment of film goes perfect with every sound you hear.  The plot is easily known without even the use of context clues.  Perfect in every aspect, I hope they do something like this again.<br />Hoorah for Daft Punk.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|Just to make clear, I never was a fan of the Clash back in the day.  In fact, I bought this CD just last summer and only because I heard and liked the title track when I heard it on a TV show.  Since poeple I knew seemed to know the song, I felt left out and, like the sheep I am, went out to get it.<br />Being a fan of The Specials, I had additional incentive, though: I knew that there was a relationship between The Clash's &quot;Rudy Can't Fail&quot; and The Specials' &quot;Here's to you, Rudie&quot;, so I had to get that song too, just to hear what the deal was.<br />This album is now one of my top 5 favorite albums of all time. <br />This CD is very difficult to categorize, but the songwriting and musicianship are so incredible that it doesn't matter.  Each track contains an edge and honesty that are rarely found these days while using various elements of ska, reggae, disco, pop, punk and good ol' Rock n' Roll.<br />Don't get me wrong: some of the melodies are very catchy and I've been singing along [when I figured out the lyrics].  But the lyrics often carry a message, a serious note to go with the melodic tones.  It's very clear that they want you to listen to what they have to say.<br />In some instances, the music style choice seems to intensify the message in the songs:  take for example &quot;Lost In a Supermarket&quot;.  This song sets a very melodic tone early on and relatively soft, pop-ish singing.  But when melancholy lyrics begin &quot;I wasn't born, so much as I fell out/nobody seemed to notice me&quot;, the friendly music and harsh lyrics work against each other to intensify the sense of loneliness felt by the narrator.  I've also found potent irony in the battle between the music and lyrics, especially in &quot;Death or Glory&quot;.<br />It's the powerful music, honesty in the lyrics, and the passion of the musicians that make this one of the most memorable albums I've ever heard.  I now understand how The Clash have been so influential to many contemporary bands.<br />Yes, I highly recommend this CD for everyone: you don't have to be punk to enjoy it.  You just have to like your music honest.<br />P.S. for the curious, the other albums in my top 5, in no particular order, are: Genesis &quot;A Trick of the Tail&quot;, Sonny Rollins &quot;Saxophone Colossus&quot;, Boston &quot;Boston&quot;, and Sting &quot;Soul Cages&quot;.
B00005JLYW|1.0|This is a good way to waste a couple hours of your life. It's simply a bunch of great movies scenes from other movies, put together into one movie to make a crappy movie.

0385504209|5.0|C'mon you guys who gave this book a bad review - IT IS A NOVEL! Who reads a novel to study art history! Or Christianity, for that matter, isn't there already a pretty well known bestseller which more than covers THAT angle? This is a fast paced, intriguing story which fascinated me from beginning to end. And I'm always appreciative of authors who refuse to devote at least half the plot to meaningless sex scenes. Don't listen to the negativity, everyone I know loves this book.
0385510438|2.0|I'm a big fan of John Grisham early works... Runaway Jury, Time to Kill etc. But this story and The Summons sucked. I read the The Summons all the way through and I never felt the suspense and after I got to the ending I felt stupid for forcing myself through the book. This story I decided not to even finish. The stories susposed to be about a man coming back and killing the jurors after he gets out of the jail. So I'm thinking that theres going to be about a 100 or so pages leading up to the man getting out of jail then there would be the killings. I got over halfway through the book which was very boring and I was still reading about the time surrounding the trial. I couldn't figure out the point of all this extra info. So I gave up. Don't waste your time if you're a fan of the early John Grisham.
B000002JPA|5.0|I have been listening to dream theater since the day it came out and have bought every other album they have done on the day it was released. I even have a DT tattoo. This is without a doubt the most talented band I have ever heard, However they are not for everyone. I believe you have to have some kind of musical backround to like Dream Theater, for they are too complex for someone who listens to top 40. I am not knocking top 40 because there is a place for it. Now back to this album. It is amazing. It was one of the first albums I listened to that used many different time signatures throughout a song. The song that hooked me was Metropolis part I. there is a part in this song where the guitarist and keyboardist play an identical solo at the same time. it is incredible. And to even my astonishment they can do it live, I've seen it.
B00005JKJA|4.0|David Lynch has a lot longer rope than most directors in Hollywood. He can get away with incomprehensible storylines, monosyllabic acting, and disquieting scenes, because he is one of Hollywood's master shotmakers. The guy can create tension with a camera and a vacant lot. His senses of style and pacing can be uncanny, if not a little bit maddening. His movies require you to pay attention, but don't always reward you for doing so. Mulholland Drive is his most interesting, and most successful film endeavor so far. <br />I spent most of the movie thinking \\"I don't understand any of this,\\" but I kept watching. I was compelled to do so. For most of the film, the dialogue is vague and campy, the acting cheesy and over-the-top, and yet I knew there was a purpose to it. I knew David Lynch was up to something. Some people have called this a dream sequence, some have called it Hollywood viewed through a kaleidoscope. I'm not sure it's either one. It also seemed a bit like spirits of the dead returning to roam the earth. All of these interpretations are plausible. <br />The plot involves Betty (Naomi Watts), a spunky and naïve young woman with dreams of stardom who arrives in Hollywood. She hooks up with Rita (Laura Harring), a beautiful amnesiac who has survived a nasty traffic pileup. The two fall in love while they search, Nancy Drew style, for clues to Rita's past. Paralleling this is a storyline of Adam (Justin Theroux), a film director having a very bad day, who is \\"directed\\" by some hired goons and higher-ups to recast the lead role in his upcoming film.<br />That's the first half of Mulholland Drive. I did my best to simplify it. It gets stranger and stranger from there, with some of Lynch's trademark images along the way: lush red drapes, lush stages, and ersatz troubadours giving incomprehensible performances.<br />I have suspicions what it all means, but I can't be quite sure. What I do know is that this film is tense, tight, beautifully filmed, and wickedly funny. Lynch has little love for Hollywood, and it shows in his digs at the film biz. Watts gives a solid, wide-ranging performance (how many actresses can do a good job of bad acting?), and Harring has that classic pinup look, which fits perfectly with Lynch's nostalgic 1950s props and sets. <br />All in all, an enjoyable experience at the movies. Odd, but enjoyable. And I'll certainly watch it again, even though, I suspect, it still won't make much sense.
B0000AZKPC|5.0|Only THREE reviews so far?  For shame.  The All Music Guide reviewer for this album, Antti J. Ravelin, said made a rather harsh and absolutely false dismissal on this album and this band.  \\"Sonata Arctica continues the tradition of their Finnish contemporaries, like Stratovarius and so on. Too bad that they just re-sample way too much of the others in their genre.\\"  Okay, number one, why compare them to Stratovarius in the first place (after all, they kinda suck...a lot)?  And if they make ANYTHING resembling a \\"re-sample,\\" it is for the absolute best.  This album is one of the most powerful and original albums in the metal genre, seamlessly combining elements of progressive, thrash, power metal, and...something else that I can't exactly put my finger on.  This Finnish group has quite a hefty debut here, featuring some terrific songs and excellent musicianship from all four members.<br />Tony Kakko on keyboards.  He has great talent on the keys, making thick, sweeping waves of synthesis, eclectic (but precise) notes and chords, or just lush background textures.  On songs such as \\"Blank File\\" and \\"8th Commandment\\" he duels with Jani's solos, and it is just insanely beautiful (yet frenzied).  But wait...HE'S THE SINGER, TOO!  And my god, this man can sing.  His range is bountiful and unbridled, and almost unmatched.  I have yet to hear more Sonata Arctica first, but I think it's fair to rank Tony among such vocalist giants as Matthew Barlow, Mikael Akerfeldt, Bruce Dickinson, Russel Allen, James LaBrie, and Warrel Dane.  He can make deeper, more operatic wails, and high-pitched, hyper falsettos that simply SOAR.  The only time on this album that the listener can really notice a little strain in Tony's voice is during one of the verses on \\"Blank File,\\" when he hits a really high note and his tone quavers slightly.  Otherwise, Tony is a FLAWLESS vocalist.<br />Jani Liimatainen, guitar virtuoso.  He creates some really thrashy riffs that give even Iced Earth a run for their money, and yet with the great bounds of melody that make Dream Theater so fascinating.  His solos are dazzling and beautiful, and he creates some interesting harmonies and leads.<br />Janne Kivilahti's bass is fairly stuck in the background, and although he follows Jani's riffs and Tommy's rhythms with ease (and that takes a lot, so Janne is obviously very talented), he never does anything that particularly stands out (at least on this album).  But hey, to be the bassist for Sonata Arctica takes a lot, so bravo to him.<br />And then there's Tommy Portimo.  Oh my god.  What is up with these fantastic drummers in just about every one of my favorite bands?  Tommy creates some fast-paced, galloping rhythms and beats that are just as harmonious and lyrical as they are rippling and even vicious.  His use of double-bass pedals qualifies him as a could-be death metal drummer, and yet his skills do not make the music any less satisfying.  He does his job VERY well.<br />Outside of the band members themselves, Sonata Arctica is quite fascinating in other ways.  Lyrically, they are very different from most power metal bands (further proving that they are NOT really power metal).  Like, \\"Blank File\\" is about the usage of the Internet prettymuch has destroyed privacy forever, and everybody is just sort of slaves to the proverbial Machine now.  Does THAT sound like cheesy fantasy to you?<br />The music as a whole is very...cold, shall I say?  But not a \\"bad\\" cold...not bleak.  Rather, Sonata's sound is a sort of cold that is more of a \\"thrill chill\\" so to speak.  It evokes the feeling of frosty winter air blowing through your senses as you travel towards a glorious and refreshing place of promise and warmth.  It's really hard to describe; just listen to this album and you'll see what I mean.  Also, the artwork accompanying the album, however simplistic, is also very \\"cold\\" - just look at the cover!  Very fitting artwork for the music - something which does not happen that often.<br />This album is great all year-round; during the winter, if the cool air is blowing in through your window as you listen to this music, you'll really FEEL the \\"Arctica\\" in the mix.  If you listen to it during the summer, winter seems to be gently caressing the back of your neck, beckoning you back into this beautiful, frosty breeze called Sonata Arctica.
B0000C7GG2|5.0|Great music and Great vocals. Although the vocals sound more like screaming it actually blends with the music and increase the intensity. Great music!
B000002MX7|4.0|Chaka Khan has had so many hits, both with Rufus and solo, that one album of greatest hits is not going to do. I like the idea of a greatest hits album with new songs, but it's too bad that the new material wasn't released as a whole album instead. Most of the &quot;hits&quot; are great, but some weren't even singles, and too many hits are missing. For example, three of Chaka's albums are ignored on this. Only one song is taken from &quot;C.K.&quot; (&quot;The End of a Love Affair&quot;), and even that was not a single. That songs is a good example of how Chaka can do jazz, but why not put &quot;It's My Party&quot; or &quot;Baby Me&quot; (both successful R&amp;B singles from &quot;C.K.&quot;) when we already have &quot;And the Melody...&quot; from &quot;What Cha' Gonna Do?&quot; (Obviously, I loved the &quot;C.K.&quot; album.) In my opinion, &quot;Love of a Lifetime,&quot; &quot;Got to be There,&quot; and something from &quot;The Woman I Am&quot; would have fit in well also. All that said, there are still some excellent choices on here besides what charted the highest.<BR>Three of my favourites were not the biggest hits in Chaka's discography, but are some of the strongest songs she has recorded. &quot;Papillon,&quot; from &quot;Naughty,&quot; instantly grabs you with a mixture of a mid-tempo disco beat and a melancholy air. &quot;I Know You, I Live You,&quot; from &quot;What Cha' Gonna Do For Me,&quot; is early 80's dance/soul music at its best. And &quot;Through the Fire,&quot; from &quot;I Feel For You,&quot; is breathtaking. Other classics are the anxiously anticipating &quot;Ain't Nobody,&quot; the classic &quot;I'm Every Woman,&quot; and the Bruce Hornsby collaboration &quot;Love Me Still.&quot; <BR>The new songs are good too, with &quot;Never Miss the Water&quot; being the single. I love the way that song starts with a wonderful wail from Chaka--one of the things she does best! &quot;Everywhere,&quot; a cover of Fleetwood Mac's 1987 hit that combines a latinrhythm with a &quot;smooth jazz&quot; guitar, should have been a single, too. <BR>Overall, this is good if you're just starting out on Chaka--however, it is not a complete collection. Anyway, with this CD so cheap, it's a good buy, featuring a healthy 16 songs.<BR>One last note...I love that album title--beautiful!
B000056H24|5.0|The one thing that sets this film apart from the others is the depth and spiritual beauty that Max Von Sydow brings to his characterization of Jesus.Charelton Heston is also very moving as the babtist.
0553125397|4.0|I would have given this book 3 stars, but I must admit I was quite curious to find out the killer's identity.<br />I love a good mystery, but my problem with this book (&amp; I am not a devoted Agatha Christie fan, prior to this I read a book of her short stories, and don't feel terribly inclined to read anymore of her work) is that after the murder takes place, the sluething is done by merely interviewing the cast of character's again &amp; again- there wasn't any suspenseful poking around, or edge of the seat moments where you're sure the inspector is going to get caught uncovering clues- it was just a bunch of conversations.  I practically needed a chart to keep track of all of the character's.<br />So, if you like your mysteries filled with drawing room chatter &amp; not a lot of physical movement/uncovering- I highly recommend this- if you like more suspense, turn to Ruth Rendell or Patricia Carlon.
B000050FEN|5.0|Never have i seen such a disturbing movie with such originality and great acting especially by Kevin Spacey. There is no doubt this is a must own for anyone (except people who have problems with intense violence and gore) as nothing comes even close to its perfection except for maybe The Silence of the Lambs. A great suspense thriller with a keep you on the edge-of-your-seat climax.
0553801546|5.0|Robin Hobb has done it!  This is one of the greatest series i have ever had the pleasure to read.  The characters in this book are so well put together and multi-faceted that it is hard to put this one down.  This book is actually the sixth in a series by the same author, the first three being the farseer series.  I highly recommend that you read those, because while all the major points are covered and explained as they should be in and series of worth, to really understand the characters all 6 books should be read.  I just finished reading this novel and I must say that I am still in shock.  I dont want to talk too much about what happens, but everything is tied up very nicely in the end, but still leaves you wishing for more.  Happy reading.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Rarely does a story capture human drama the way this 'cut short' space western epic does.  To my surprise, the character development was superb and story lines were very well written.  To me, I just couldn't conceive a reason for the show being cancelled.  It was that good.  My wife, whom I credit with forcing me to actually purchase the discs, told me that the studio failed to air them in order.  You have to watch them in order to make sense of the story.  I'm glad that I had not seen nor heard of them back then, because the confusion would have doomed the series for me.  This was an unfortunate screw up that can be pointed straight at Fox Studio Execs.  Their loss, big time!  They missed out on tons of revenue from this wonderful series.  Maybe, they'll get an ounce of sanity and pick up the series sometime after the new 'Firefly' movie goes into production this summer.  As far as these discs go, the special effects are spectacular and filmed with techniques not normally seen on a TV Sci-fi show. The soundtrack music is a wonderful blend of modern and western flair.  Though not in dolby 5.1, it does fill the room nicely.  For something different, pick these discs up, you won't be disappointed.
B00001MXXH|4.0|Everyone who was born in the sixties needs this one in thier collection.  The DVD lets us feel like it was made today, but the quick, dumd, humor puts it in with Tommy Boy, Fast Times At Ridgemont High, and Planes Trains and Automobiles. It is worth it just to hear Ferris,s computer cough.
B00005YUNY|5.0|Yes has released a lot of DVDs, so I hesitated buying another. But to my pleasant surprise, &quot;Symphonic Live&quot; was well worth the investment, and turns out to be their best yet. It's beautifully lit and filmed , the sound is excellent, and - if you love classic Yes - the song selection coulnd't be better. Highly recommended.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|What happened to you Britney? This CD is horrible. Don't buy it. Spending a penny on this would be a waste. Britney used to sing good songs with pop that showed off her ability to carry a fantastic tune. Now that she's older, popular, and knows it, she went from innocent, pink, and sweet to &quot;I'm so hot, might as well do a crappy album.&quot; <BR>The songs are terrible and very techno-ish, I mean where did that come from? I especially hate &quot;Toxic&quot; I mean, have you seen the video? Yuck! This CD sold well because people probably expected it to be great like her other albums, without even listening to it first. <br />Britney get a clue: Change may be good, but not this kind of change!
B00018D44U|5.0|I like all kinds of music - jazz and country included.  And unlike some reviewers, so far my favorite song is &quot;Creepin' In&quot; with Dolly Parton.  My kids love it too!
B000089RVX|5.0|Yes, Amy Lee Rocks! She has an interesting, original voice. It sounds like an adult Avril Lavigne with more passion. I like how the CD has both rock and piano music.<br />1. Going Under - Wow, what a feirce song. The music and lyrics are so orignal! It's about feeling trapped in pain, an obsession hitting rock bottom.<BR>2. Bring Me To Life - I like the fast music, and slow tune, it's no typical rock song. About feeling worthless and despratly needing to be saved from the lack of life in her.<BR>3. Everybody's Fool - This song is awesome. I sing it all the time! It's about finding out that a girl that everyone admired deeply was a fake.<BR>4. My Immortal - I find this song very sad. It's about trying to get through the fact that a friend is forever gone.<BR>5. Haunted - This song rocks. The creepy sounding harmony in the beginning sounds so cool. About a someone she loves but fears.<BR>6. Tourniquet - I've never heard a song like this, I almost don't know what to think of it. Good rocker, though. It's about how she was so lost and unfaithful before, she's afraid she won't get to heaven.<BR>7. Imaginary - Another well written song (Amy's a good poet).This is about wanting to stay asleep where she can escape reality.<BR>8. Taking Over Me - This song screams ROCK ROCK! But I find this complicated to figure out. I think it's pretty much about how she has fallen obsessivly in love.<BR>9. Hello - This song is very mystical. It takes you to a differant place. Mostly piano, and some strings. This is about how people thinks she's weird, she has no friends, and family might be suggesting maybe getting her some help as she wishes her whole life was a dream.<BR>10. My Last Breath - I like the tune of this song. About how she was seperated from her lover by death, a spirit now trying to reach him.<BR>11. Whisper - Hmmmm... expressive lyrics. This song is strange, but interesting. This is about how she's paranoid that death is right around the corner.
B000002O1Q|5.0|The music on this CD is incredible.  It boggles my mind that someone hasn't turned this into a Broadway musical yet (if it ever happens, you heard it here first).  It would run for years!  I just don't know who they'd find to match the power and range of Laurie Sergeant.    But back to the CD - The order of the tracks is not the same as the movie and the alternate version of \\"Countdown To Love\\" is somewhat lacking compared to the movie version.  Also, \\"Deeper and Deeper\\" by the Fixx is good, but seems out of place.  These minor quibbles aside, this atypical classic 80's rock soundtrack should be in every music lover's collection.    Jim Steniman, Ry Cooder, Tom Petty, Bob Seeger... the array of talent on this disc is outstanding.  Most notable are the Jim Steniman compositions (\\"Nowhere Fast\\" and \\"Tonight Is What It Means To Be Young\\") - pure GENIUS.  If TIWIMTBY doesn't send chills up your spine, you're dead or ought to be.    Often overlooked are two numbers performed by the Blasters (\\"One Bad Stud\\" and \\"Blue Shadows\\").  These tunes are HOT.  \\"Sorcerer \\" (penned by Stevie Nicks) is a haunting lament that really suits the mood of the movie (as do most of the songs on the disc).    Fire, Inc. does an incredible job (who were these studio musicians and where are they now) and Dan Hartman's \\"I Can Dream About You\\" was a huge single that played on the radio for months during the mid 80's.  It's a shame much of the CD got little air play.    Anyway, do yourself a favor, buy the CD if you don't own it.  Buy the DVD too.  Hearing the music is one thing, but hearing it in context is another.  You'll love it!
B00008EYA5|4.0|An arrested drug kingpin is transported by a Los Angeles Police Department SWAT team led by Jackson's character out of the city and into federal custody. Plans go awry when the kingpin offers $100 million to anyone who can free him.<br />This was a fun and excellent take on the '70s TV series where a wily SWAT sergeant returns to assemble, train, and lead a group of five officers who have to escort a notorious international criminal. Director Clark Johnson who has worked as a director (&quot;NYPD Blue&quot;)or actor (&quot;Homicide&quot;) on a TV police drama doesn't go over the top and lets the movie remain faithful to original source. The cast here is great with Jackson as &quot;Hondo&quot; and Farrell as Street and Olivier Martinez brings a weasel-like charm to his character. Even Steve Forrest, who portrayed Hondo on the TV series has a small role here which is nice to see.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|As someone around the same age as Bill Murray's character, I think the movie had a greater impact. The feeling of isolation, the ennui, and other travails of one's middle years are all here.<br />I liked the that the characters could develop a deep, intimate bond without jumping in the sack. It is refreashing to see a movie that can explore relationships with some real emotion.
B00005JM4Z|2.0|Paul Walker returns in this sequel to 2001's The Fast and the Furious. Brian O'Conner (Walker) has left L.A due to his illegal actions from the first movie and now soars the streets of Miami making money here and there by street racing.  Watched by Customs Agent Monica Fuentes (Mendes), Brian is caught by the police and is given a deal by Agent Markham and Bilkins to go undercover and try to bring down drug lord Carter Verone (Hauser)in exchange for his criminal record to be erased. Brian agrees but only if he is given permission to choose his partner. Brian heads home to Barsto, Arizona where he recruits an old friend Roman Pearce (Tyrese) to help him. Pearce agrees but only for the same deal Brian was offered. With the help of Monica, Brian and Rome work together to take down Verone.  This was a horrible movie.  There was no reason to make a sequel.  They should have stopped after the first one.
1558216847|5.0|There can be little doubt that history is more interesting than fiction. This particular account proves the point. It is hard and perhaps impossible to imagine the difficulties described in this book if they hadn't actually occurred. I sometimes have to pause and appreciate the problems even our own American pioneers faced as they moved across this land many years ago. These accounts pale when compared to the things which confronted Rawicz and his companions as they walked to freedom in the wake of WW-II. While I've not read exhaustively about the war, this book..as others have noted..was one very difficult to set aside. I recommend it very highly.  I covered the material via tape from Blackstone Audio.
B00005JLYW|1.0|Natalie (Cameron Diaz), Dylan (Drew Barrymore), and Alex (Lucy Liu), three glamorous, tough-as-nails, investigative agents who work for the Charles Townsend Detective Agency are sent to retrieve two missing rings.  The rings contain information that reveals the new identities of every person in the FBI's Witness Protection Program.  After five of the program's participants turn up dead, only the Angels can stop the perpetrator, using their expertise as masters of disguise, espionage and martial arts.  This was, by far, one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  This movie was a music video. Nothing more then that. A lot of skin, a lot of explosions, a lot of music, but no substance.
6304779356|5.0|I think this is one of the best movies ever made.... I read a review criticizing the fact that it is not precisely based on vampires guidelines, and perhaps it is not. But this is not meant to be only a horror movie, this is a hilarious comedy well acted, well filmed and a great action movie at the same time.<BR>Vampires by the way don't exist, at least according to public knowledge, so everything is allowed, the buffy series has already proved that much.
B0000YEEGM|5.0|Rain Man is a movie that appeals to the sense of emotion like no other movie I've seen in quite sometime. It is truely a masterpiece with performances of Hoffman &amp; Cruise. I'm glad they finally releashed a special edition version on DVD, I have enjoyed watching it and the features which are a Deleted Scene, Behind-The-Scenes Docu, and Photo Gallerys. The film will always hold a special meaning inside of me between the bonding of brothers who couldn't be anymore different. I highly recommend picking up this new SE DVD of Rain Man, it's well worth your buck and than some.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Chuttup to all those people who don't like this movie! You should be eaten by Hungry Hungry Hippos. Okay just named two references to the movie and fans would know exactly what I mean! (And would call me a dork) <br />Like &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; or &quot;Empire Records&quot; (Damn the man, save the empire) Donnie Darko is another cult-classic film about or catering to Generation Y and Z--the generation who like to think, who speak fast and care more about others then themselves. (No offense, Generation X, its not your fault you were all products of the Me Me Me Eighties)<br />We're not sure *exactly* what the film is trying to say but all the themes are here--loneliness, being different, depression, dying, love, parents, future. <br />Donnie Darko escapes death when a demonic looking bunny tells him to get up and go out to a golf course, to prevent being crushed by a plane engine that falls out of nowhere...perhaps through a time travel barrier from the future...?<br />Things get just plain weird though, when he has imaginary dreams, the bunny tells him the world will end in 28 days (Perhaps not 'the world' but Donnie's world?) he sleepwalks and uncovers secrets of people in his town unintentionally (or intentionally...?) and people he loves get hurt. <br />Donnie is afraid of being alone. Especially of dying alone. But sometimes sacrifice is the only way to let the people you love live...and to never be alone.<br />Whatever your stance on this movie, it will keep you up all night.
B000127LW2|5.0|In this different but wonderfully well crafted boxed set of Star Trek Voyager season one; fans of Star Trek Voyager are treated to its first season which, in comparison with the other series, is a very good season.  Of course, Voyager benefits greatly from the mistakes made during the first seasons of Star Trek The Next Generation and Star Trek Deep Space Nine.  With this great first season, Voyager isn't struggling to establish a series or establish a framework to work within, that's already been set up both those two other exceptional series.<br />Voyager's first season albeit a short one, does a wonderful job of establishing the premise of the series and establishing the characters that will inhabit the imaginations of fans for the next seven years.  One of the better aspects of this season is it doesn't suffer from some of the mistakes made during the second season as in that season they concentrated a little too heavily on the Kazon, which for most fans was a major detractor as I know I was and most fans were asking, when are they ever going to get out of and away from Kazon space.  <br />Of interest to me about this first season and the series as a whole is the series producer's perfect decision to captain this new vessel with a strong female character in Captain Kathryn Janeway, which was a welcome decision that was a long time coming but a definitive eventuality.  <br />The characters of Star Trek Voyager:<br />Captain Kathryn Janeway - Played brilliantly by Kate Mulgrew, Janeway is a strong and brilliant engineer and sciences minded commanding officer.  Among her strongest features is also her principles which lead her to the decision to save the Ocampa by destroying the Caretaker's array in the premiere episode which results in stranding her crew and the crew of the Maquis ship in the Delta Quadrant with a 70,000 light year trip home to which she vows to her newly combined crew that she will get them home...  After watching the special feature with Genevieve Bujold as Janeway, one simply cannot imagine her having been in this role!<br />Commander Chakotay (Robert Beltran) - Maquis leader and former Starfleet officer; he is a member of a Native American tribe which relocated to what later became the DMZ between the Federation and the Cardassians.  When the treaty went bad for his homeworld, he left Starfleet to fight with the Maquis.  As Janeway's first officer, he must tread the thin line between Maquis principles and rigid Starfleet codes.<br />Lieutenant Commander Tuvok (Tim Russ) - Vulcan Starfleet security officer who is well aged and to whom many aboard Voyager but especially B'Elanna look upon as a mentor.  Without his counsel, Janeway would be lost.<br />Lieutenant Tom Paris (Robert Duncan McNeill) - Former Starfleet officer that ran into trouble and fled to the Maquis only to end up in a Starfleet prison.  He is a superior pilot and helms Voyager through thick and thin.  This is the Captain Kirk of the crew when it comes to womanizing...<br />Ensign Harry Kim (Garrett Wang) - Fresh from Starfleet Academy; at the outset of the series he is very green in the role of operations officer but look for this character to mature rapidly when faced with everything the crew must face in their journey home.<br />Lieutenant B'Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson) - Half Klingon and half Human former Maquis now Chief Engineer.  Until Seven of Nine shows up, look to this character for some of the strongest non Janeway stories as she continues to struggle between her Klingon and Human sides to achieve some form of inner peace.<br />The Doctor (Robert Picardo) - Emergency Medical Hologram (EMH Mark I).  Look for this character to provide some of the most poignant and hilarious scenes throughout the seven year run.<br />Neelix (Ethan Phillips) - A Talaxian who helps Janeway during &quot;Caretaker&quot; and along with Kes becomes members of Voyager's crew.  This character will most certainly provide some of the most memorable episodesthroughout the series run as he takes on the roles of Ambassador, Head Cook and Morale officer.<br />Kes (Jennifer Lien) - Ocampan who is rescued during &quot;Caretaker&quot; and is, at the outset of the series, Neelix's companion.  During her short time on Voyager she takes on the role as the Doctor's assistant.  The Ocampan's only live for nine years but her part only lasts for three years as she joins the Denise Crosby and Terry Farrell club.<br />Standout episodes:<br />Caretaker - I list this one as it does, as a premier episode, a great job of introducing the series even that much more so than the premier episodes of TNG and DS9.<br />Emanations - This is a highly intriguing episode which goes where few Star Trek episodes dare to go, into &quot;religion&quot; and the afterlife.<br />Heroes and Demons - This episode does a wonderful job of establishing itself and future episodes in which the Doctor will be the prime player.<br />Faces - This is an extremely fascinating episode that does a superior job in establishing some of B'Elanna's back story while telling a poignant tale.<br />Jetrel - This is an extremely poignant story about Neelix and the destruction of his home world's moon during a costly war in which the Talaxian's enemy used a weapon of mass destruction. <br />I highly recommend this series to any and all fans of good Sci-Fi from the universe of Star Trek.  This is a great series that should be given a chance by all fans of Star Trek.  {ssintrepid}<br />Episode List:<br />Caretaker<br />Parallax<BR>Time and Again<BR>Phage<BR>The Cloud<BR>Eye of the Needle<BR>Ex Post Facto<BR>Emanations<BR>Prime Factors<BR>State of Flux<BR>Heroes and Demons<BR>Cathexis<BR>Faces<BR>Jetrel<BR>Learning Curve<br />Special Features:<br />-Braving the Unknown:  Season One<BR>-Voyager Time Capsule:  Kathryn Janeway<BR>-The First Captain:  Bujold<BR>-Cast Reflections:  Season One<BR>-On Location with the Kazons<BR>-Red Alert:  Visual Effects Season One<BR>-Launching Voyageron the Web<BR>-Real Science with Andre Bormanis<BR>-Photo Gallery<BR>-Some hidden clips
0553582445|5.0|Never have I ever read a series that so completely involved my emotions. I'm not fond of books written in first-person, but from the very start with Assassin's Apprentice, Fitzchivalry Farseer drew me in.  I've also never sped through a series so quickly, or been drawn into grief by a book of any sort. This book made me cry, and I'm far from a sentimental sort. I'm appallingly eager to get my paws on the last book, and I'll add Robin Hobb to my list of &quot;must have them ALL&quot; authors.
B00005MJ13|5.0|Before the great conductor Ferenc Fricsay died (tragically young at the age of 48 in 1963), he made dozens of brilliant mono and stereo recordings for Deutsche Grammophon. Many of his most significant recordings have been released on CD, though some have already drifted out-of-print (Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra, Mozart Syms 29, 39-41 and Beethoven Syms 3, 5 & 7 for example), while others are only available as expensive imports. This past year there has even been a limited edition box set of his music released (in the \\"Original Masters\\" series -- see my review). Well, let me just say that any and all of Fricsay's recordings for DG are worth getting, regardless of what you have to pay! I am delighted to discover that this DG Originals Import of Fricsay performing Dvorak's 9th Symphony, Smetana's Die Moldau and Liszt's Les Preludes is available through Amazon. Both the Smetana (1960) and the Liszt (1959) are first rate, but the 1959 stereo account Dvorak \\"New World\\" is among the finest I've ever heard.  And don't think this title is in anyway inferior because it is only available as an import. The only reason this DG Originals title was not released in the States is because it directly competes with another title in their series by Rafael Kubelik. Certainly, if DG can find room for both the Fricsay and the Kubelik performances in its catalog, collectors can too on their CD shelves.
078324228X|5.0|A decent drama based on real charecter, Rubin Carter sent to jail for a crime he didn't commit. If he wasn't sent to jail, would Muhammed Ali be called the greatest. This is epical movie and takes us on an unforgettable journey to the freedom of Legendary charecter, Rubin &quot;the Hurricane&quot; Carter, who fought the good fight and bestowed his evil, for hate is the bringer of pain, fight it and look to better days. Outstanding preformance from Denzel and the rest of the Charecters.
B00005CDNI|5.0|By the time Voulez-Vous was released in 1979, the disco era was in full swing, the mirror ball still glittering ablaze.  Hence many of the tracks are suitable for the old platforms and flared trousers.  However, the usual Agnetha ballads are there, and great ones too.  Unfortunately, Bjorn and Agnetha announced their divorce before the album's completion, although their professional relationship would continue as before.<br />After a quick strings, a funky disco beat and synths kick in to intro &quot;As Good As New,&quot; which describes the spirit ABBA has since the merely great Album.  A standout track.<br />The title track, another candidate for Studio 54, has as backing musicians members of the group Foxy, the pulsing bass and burst of horns in tune with the disco era.  That's followed by Frida's vocal on the inspirational ballad &quot;I Have A Dream,&quot; on that dream or fantasy that make life worth living.<br />Put on your dancing shoes for the next four songs.  &quot;Angeleyes,&quot; about a louse who likes to hypnotize young girls with those eyes, is sung from the POV of a former victim.  &quot;The King Has Lost His Crown,&quot; when he loses his new girl, so the song goes in this Frida-lead song.<br />I've always liked the catchiness of this tune, but ever since seeing Johnny English, hearing this elicits a snicker out of me.  The single &quot;Does Your Mother Know&quot;, sung by Bjorn, with its leading bass keyboards and rock guitar, on a young lady who may be out having a good time without her mother's knowledge.  It's also the track Rowan Atkinson's character is doing a karaoke to in an embarrassing bathroom sequence, funny faces and all, played to the audience at the coronation scene in the movie.  My favourite track here.<br />&quot;If It Wasn't For The Nights&quot; is just asking to be included on a Pure Disco or Best of Disco compilation with the strings and drums, and the theme of the nights being an escape after an unrewarding day, much like Tony Manero of Sat. Night Fever.<br />&quot;Chiquitita&quot; is one of Agnetha's better ballads, and was the song they did at the UNICEF benefit concert less than a week before the divorce announcement of Bjorn and Agnetha.  The engaging measured rhythm in the chorus reminds me a bit of the Beatles' &quot;Don't Pass Me By.&quot;  The B-side, &quot;Lovelight,&quot; is more upbeat.<br />Frida announces the medical claim that &quot;Lovers (Live A Little Longer),&quot; which gives lovers a chance to live twice in this swinging disco number.  That's followed by the high energy &quot;Kisses Of Fire.&quot;<br />The bouncy Bee-Gees' sounding &quot;Summer Night City&quot; was another song that didn't make it on the original release, odd, as it was a Top Ten hit in many countries.  And if anything fits disco, it's yet another song originally left off Voulez-Vous.  &quot;Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)&quot; with its piercing flute sound, bass, and string-synths is perfect for those dancing shoes and poofed up Afros, as it was also included on the Pure Disco 2 compilation.  It's what &quot;Money Money Money&quot; would be dressed up in disco instrumentation.<br />A marked improvement over The Album, and given the near year it took for the album, where for a while, every other song idea was rejected, Voulez-Vous stands out as one of ABBA's best albums, and I detect a more concentrated effort at perfection, and it shows.ony Manero of Sat.

B00014NE62|4.0|This was a very important film to me as it was instrumental in my own coming out process. I have waited a long time for the DVD version to appear. Let me preface my warning with the comment that this is a beautifully filmed and acted movie.<br />However, I was profoundly dismayed by one major issue with this DVD. The deleted scenes contain nude shots from behind of actor Adrian Ross Magenty, who, according to the commentary by director James Ivory, was sixteen years old at the time. I would not have ordered this DVD if I had known that it contained these scenes. I consider these scenes to be inappropriate. This review is a warning to all those who feel similarly, so that you can avoid unwittingly purchasing something that you consider to be inappropriate.
B0000WN0VY|5.0|I first discovered Damien Rice by watching the video for Volcano on VH1 and from that point this CD has become my favorite. The songs in this CD range from a wonderful raw character (The Blower's daughter, with its repetition of the &quot;I can't take my eyes off you&quot; line in different degrees of pain and with a subtle cello in the back) to the unexpected epic quality of Eskimo. This is a disc that keeps company of people with a broken heart (Cheers Darling), with memories of melancholy (Older Chests), despair (Delicate, Cold Water) or love (Volcano). His voice is passionate, his songwriting poetry and his music full of contradictory yet sublime feelings. This CD is a tremendous accomplishment in a music world where many singer-songwriters sound the same and where feelings seem manufactured. This is definitely a CD for those looking for an original approach of everyday sadness.
B000031WD9|4.0|I used to hate this movie! It was with no good reason however. When it first came out for rental my roommate rented it. I had started a new job at the time and was unable to watch it because I had to go to bed in order to get up by 7:30 am. It was a week night and my roommate had some friends over. They laughed so much and so loud that I was unable to sleep. I had a hatred toward the movie because of this. As I laid in my bed with a pillow over my head, I thought how funny could that damn movie possibly be!! I know it's a silly reason for me to not have watched the movie till now, but I was so bias due to a nights sleep lost right before starting that new job. So now nearly 5 years later, and after seeing the 2 sequels, I brought myself to buy the unrated version. I now know why they were laughing so loud. It's not only funny but well written with great characters.  So even tho I got to know the characters in AP2 and American Wedding, it was nice to rewind and see where it all started. And yes once again it was dumb of me to blame such a cool flick, but I still think my roommate was rude. He knew I had to get up early. Well thanks for listening to my somewhat tragic story, I just felt it would help me to explain how cool the movie turned out to be even after I hated it for so many years ..to no fault of it's own. ~UNRATED DVD includes: A spotlight on location featurette / Commentary with filmmakers / Outtakes / Soundtrack info &amp; music video / Info about cast members &amp; filmmakers / plus more.
0345440900|1.0|I bought this book before I had my baby and had absolutely no clue about parenting and how I was going to raise my baby. The only thing I knew was that I was going to breastfeed, and reading Hogg's statements about breastfeeding made me sick. The good thing about her feeding part is that she does make formula feeding Moms NOT feel guilty about their choice, which is a great thing. I was able to breastfeed with no problems, and can only imagine how hard it must be to those Moms who couldn't, for whatever reasons. The bad thing is that if you are not quite sure if you will breastfeed or not, and take this book as an advice, chances are you will be heading to the store to stock up on formula. She understate the benefits of breastmilk and reminds those worried about body image that breastfeeding might leave you \\"flat as a pancakes\\". I am sorry, but if you were concearned about body image, pregnancy itself probably took care of that!!! I kept reading and the worse was about to come: \\"As this book is being written, scientists are experimenting with the notion of genetically altering cows to produce human breast milk. If that happens, perhaps in the future everyone will tout cow's milk.\\" That was the most bizzare thing I've read in a while, not to mention ridiculous!<BR>Okay, but the main subject of this book is her baby training parenting system called E.A.S.Y. It basically consists of E(eating), A(activity), S(sleep) and Y(you). I believe this parenting style might work for some parents who plan on training the baby to fit in their lives, so Mom and baby knows what comes next. She states that feeding on demand makes babies demanding, and that you should not rock your baby to sleep. I ended up breastfeeding our baby on demand, co-sleeping, and cuddling and holding him as much as I could(both big No-Nos according to Hogg). <br />So, finally, this book did not do it for me. I don't believe you have to give up your life in order to raise a child and be miserable because of it. But you don't have to put your child on her E.A.S.Y schedule either. Just follow your heart, enjoy raising your baby and PLEASE read other parenting book out there, like Dr. Sears' ones or \\"The Happiest Baby on The Block\\" by Harvey Karp. Parenting is a very personal and important issue, and you can never have to much information and knowledge about it.
B00005JKZV|1.0|First of all, to all you dateless losers who watched this crap, let me say that winning awards does not mean that you are vindicated; these movies still blow. Just a bunch of bad acting, just a bunch of faires and elves and dwarfs running around killing each other over a small gold ring (And spare me the mind set from you putzes that think I don't get it, a classic struggle of good vs. evil with the circular symbol of the ring telling us that the struggle will always be, for all eternity, see, I get it). The problem is that Peter Jackson looks like a big, fat, dateless, emotinally weak moron who identifies more with make believe than he does real life; a man who can't control his own weight let alone the process with which to make a good movie. Poor J.R.R. Tolkien, he's got fans who dress up as hobits and elves to see his movies. Even in death he's got no peace. This movie is a reason NOT to get out of bed in the morning. And you people are lucky I don't have control over the A-bomb. And no, Jason Gilmore, you will not be the next Tolkien. You can't even write an interesting on-line review.
B00003CXIY|4.0|This no-holds-barred comedy is one hilarious movie! ROAD TRIP is basically a rude, crude, nasty movie from start to finish! People may be offended with the rude acts in this movie, but forget them! It's supposed to be fun.<br />When a college student named Josh accidently sends an lurid and incriminating tape having sex with a girl to his girlfriend in Texas, he and his pals decide to travel 1800 miles in three days in order to prevent the tape from getting there! The results are laugh out loud funny. They go through several detours including a blown-up car and mishaps with stereotypical people. Tom Green is the funniest member of the talented cast by \\"narrating\\" his story to us.  <br />Seann William Scott(AMERICAN PIE fame) also stars in this 2000 unrated edition DVD, which shows more nudity and crude acts not seen from the theatrical version! So watch it if you like funny movies!

B00005JMJ4|2.0|*sigh*<br />I can only assume any reviewer who believed this movie was &quot;subtle&quot;, &quot;deep&quot;, or &quot;intellectual&quot; has confined themselves to &quot;Power Ranger&quot; and &quot;Austin Power&quot; movies their entire lives.  To a blind man given sight, the dimmest nightlight looks brilliant.<br />There is nothing spectacular about this film; the storyline is a rather obvious twist on the same old tried and true themes, the cinematography and editing are fair at best - the soundtrack is good, that's one point.   The movie had no Earthly business being nominated for any Oscars, and Sophia Coppola had absolutely no right being mentioned in the same breath as Peter Jackson, Peter Weir, or Clint Eastwood.  The fact that she actually won for best screenplay (of all things) shows that daddy Francis still wields much power in Tinseltown.<br />Best bet is to look at some foreign and indy films if you really want to get away from mainstream Hollywood.  Watch a bunch, some of these stink too.  Once you have a true appreciation for intelligent filmmaking, you will understand the mediocrity of Coppola's \\"work\\".

B000003TA4|5.0|Nirvana's Nevermind, one of the influential albums of the last many years (yes, people are saying it's not that influential) should definitely be an amazon.com essential recording.  It is number 17 on Rolling Stone's top 500 albums of all time and it is number 2 on VH1's list.  There are no weak songs on Nevermind in my opinion.  They range from heavy (Smells Like Teen Spirit) to calm (Something in the Way), but are all catchy and have really become legendary in the last decade.  Kurt, Kris, and Dave were all amongst the best at their instruments and they wrote some great songs.  I personally think Nevermind is their best album, like most people say, and not In Utero, like some die-hard fans say.  It could even be my favorite album that I own.  Amazon, make Nevermind an essential recording because it is one of the albums out there that truly deserves it.

B0000TB01Y|4.0|WICKED is an outstanding new musical from the pen of Stephen Schwatz (PIPPIN, THE BAKER'S WIFE) based on the novel of the same name by Gregory Maguire.  This musical is probably the Great White Hope of the 2003-04 Broadway season.<br />Maguire's novel recounts the early lives of Oz's Glinda (the Good Witch of the North) and Elphaba (the Wicked Witch of the West), long before Dorothy and her house dropped into the story.<br />Kristin Chenoweth (STEEL PIER, ANNIE) and Idina Menzel (RENT) play, respectively, Glinda and Elphaba.<br />The musical is told in flashback as Glinda recalls meeting Elphaba at Shiz University, where the two aspiring students became room-mates.  Elphaba is treated as an outcast because of her green skin, but soon shows much promise, and is groomed as the protege of the Wizard (Joel Grey - CABARET, CHICAGO).  Glinda becomes romantically involved with the handsome yet shallow Prince Fiyero (Norbert Leo Butz), though he soon begins to take a fancy to Elphaba's charms.  Elphaba's crippled sister  Nessarose (played by Michelle Federer)  who would become the Wicked Witch of the East  - the one Dorothy's house drops on -  also figures heavily in the action.  Carole Shelley also impresses with a masterful performance as the corrupt college dean Madame Morrible, with fine support from Christopher Fitzgerald (BABES IN ARMS) as Nessarose's munchkin companion Boq.<br />Stephen Schwartz, with Winnie Holzman's libretto, streamlines Gregory Maguire's sprawling, complicated novel, with a charming and imaginative score.  Standout numbers include \\"Popular\\", \\"I'm Not That Girl\\", \\"Defying Gravity\\" and the effective opening number (which sums up the theme of the show) called \\"No-one Mourns the Wicked\\".<br />A must-own!
B0001IN0DA|5.0|This Wrestlemania is hyped up to be the greatest sports event ever, and I believe the hype.  All Wrestlemanias are wonderful, and with the 20th wrestlemania, this one shall be amazing.<br />Triple-Threat Match for The World Heavyweight Championship:<BR>Chris Benoit vs. Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H (c)<br />This match will be amazing with Chris Benoit recently changing to Raw and his feud with Shawn Michaels.  I believe this will be a long, good match with Triple H retaining. 9.9/10<br />WWE Championship:<BR>Kurt Angle vs. Eddie Guerrero (c)<br />Although Raw is much better than Smackdown!, smackdown seems to put on a good performance at ppv's.  This match should be amazing with all the storylines between angle and guerrero.  Angle will win. 9/10<br />The Dead Will Arise Again:<BR>The Undertaker vs. Kane<br />This is my most anticipated match for Wrestlemania XX.  With Undertaker being buried alive at the hands of Kane at Survivor Series '03, this match will be brutal.  Although this match is not a hardcore match, I believe it will end up being on.  Prediction: You Can't Kill What's Already Dead! Undertaker will win. 9.8/10<br />Goldberg vs. Brock Lesnar<BR>Special Guest Referee: Stone Cold Steve Austin<br />This match will be unbelievable.  It will be a long, grueling match.  Towards the end of the contest, Austin will first stun lesnar,  then \\"stun\\" the whole crowd by stunning goldberg as well.  Lesnar will get up before goldberg and give him a kick to the mid-section, lift him up, F-5, 1-2-3. Lesnar will win.<BR>10/10<br />Playboy Evening Gown Match:<BR>Torrie Wilson & Sable vs. Stacy Keibler & Miss Jackie <br />Although I like technical wrestling, dont get me wrong, I also like the divas.  This will be a tremendous catfight.  Keibler & Jackie are jealous of Sable & Torrie and trying to prove that they are the hottest WWE divas, they will put on something extra special.  <BR>Prediction: Torrie Wilson & Sable will win.<br />U.S. Championship:<BR>John Cena vs. Big Show (c)<br />Big Show has been champion way too long.  He is not an entertaining wrestler, so he will lose his title at WM XX.  Even though Big Show usually slows matches down, Wrestlemania brings out your best effort.  Big Show will not leave it up to Cena for entertaining the crowd in this match.  8/10<BR>Prediction: John Cena will become the new U.S. Champion.<br />Open Cruiserweight Elimination Match:<br />Cruiserweights are always exciting and unpredictable.  This will be a high-flyin' match, but I think Chavo will retain.  Mysterio will not win.  Who knows, maybe someone like Nunzeo will win (lol)  Seriously though....... 8.5/10<BR>Prediction: Chavo will retain. <br />Rock 'N Sock Connection vs. Randy Orton, Batista, & Ric Flair<br />With Rock's recent return, he will put on an amazing performance.  Even though Foley can't wrestle anyomore, this will still be an entertaining match. 7/10<BR>Prediction: Rock 'N Sock Connection will win.<br />Women's Championship:<BR>Molly Holly vs. Victoria (c)<br />Victoria will win.  Molly Holly will have her head shaved.  This will be an o.k. match, but Molly getting her head shaved will be the most entertaining part. 6/10<BR>Prediction: Victoria will retain her title.<br />Christian vs. Chris Jericho<br />These two men are both great wrestlers.  Jericho & Christian's relationship has been destroyed, and Christian has been acting like an @$$ clown lately.  7/10<BR>Prediction: Jericho will win and Trish Stratus will love him.<br />World Tag Team Championship:<BR>Dudley Boyz vs. Mark Jindrak & Garrison Cade vs. La Resistance vs. Rob Van Dam & Booker T (c)<br />This will be a great match.  Jindrak & Cade will pull out an upset and become the new tag team champions. 8/10<br />Predicted Match:<br />WWE Tag Team Championship:<BR>The Self-Proclaimed World's Greatest Tag Team vs. APA vs. Basham Brothers vs. Rikishi & Scotty 2 Hotty (c)<br />This will be a good match.  WGTT will win (finally). WGTT deserve the belts and will put on a great performance becoming the New Tag Team Champions.  7.3/10

Every song is achingly beautiful in it's own way. John's lyrics are deep and surprisingly catchy, and his voice is confident and proud. If you listen carefully, you will be surprised over and over again by different little pretty parts that you previously overlooked. John fans and RHCP fans (i am both!) will love this album.

B000063DIH|4.0|The 90s were a really hard time for not only Iron Maiden, but most 80s bands. Their first album of the era, No Prayer for the Dying, was a complete critical flop. Fear of the Dark came 2 years later, and it was an improvement on the strengths of the last album. It seems to split fans of the band a lot, and its always had very mixed opinions about it, maybe more than any other Maiden album. And while it's not on par with most of their 80s output, Fear of the Dark is still good album for Maiden standards, and superb for any other band. <br />The first 3 tracks are all great. The Opener &quot;Be Quick or Be Dead&quot; follows a usual Maiden formula and proves to be an awesome opener, fast, catchy, heavy, and rockin'. The next song (&quot;From Here to Eternity) is something sort of new for the band, as the song has very Motley Crue-ish lyrics and plain Hair-Metal sound to it, but it's largely successful, as its one of the catchiest tracks on the album. Next up is &quot;Afraid to Shoot Strangers&quot;, is an awesome epic that builds up from a calm ballad to an all-out sonic assault. Now the album's greatness begins to... unravel. Fear is the Key is a strange (but very boring) song, as is Childhood's End. Both lack a catchy chorus or interesting structures. The album begins regaining strenght with one of their finest ballads, &quot;Wasting Love&quot;, as well 2 very catchy tracks (the fast &quot;The Fugitive&quot; and mid-tempo &quot;Chains of Misery&quot;) solid, even if they can be somewhat repetitive. &quot;The Aparition&quot; is the lowest point of the album and one of their worst songs, its better to skip it. Next up is another REALLY catchy and strong track, &quot;Judas Be My Guide&quot;, it has a killer chorus. Like with &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot;, second to last song &quot;Weekend Warrior&quot; sounds very Un-Maiden-like, almost like it could've been picked out of an AC/DC album. It's not a bad track, save for the awful lyrics, its another catchy mid-temposong. The title-track is one of the most best Maiden epics ever, right up there with Hallowed Be Thy Name. There's not much to say about this track that hasn't been said already, it's simply amazing (The Live Versions of it ARE a lot better, though).<br />At the end of the day, had Maiden cut out 3 or 4 tracks off the album, the album would've felt less bogged down by drag compositions, and would've been much stronger. However still with the few unremarkable tracks, it's still a great and solid offering worthy of any fan's Collection.<br />Song Ratings:<br />Be Quick or Be Dead- 10/10<BR>From Here to Eternity- 9.5/10<BR>Afraid to Shoot Strangers- 10/10<BR>Fear is the Key- 5/10<BR>Childhood's End- 5/10<BR>Wasting Love- 9.5/10<BR>The Fugitive- 9/10<BR>Chains of Misery- 9/10<BR>The Apparition- 3/10<BR>Judas be My Guide- 10/10<BR>Weekend Warrior- 8.5/10<BR>Fear of the Dark- 10/10

B0001611DI|5.0|Truly one of the greatest horror movies let alone zombie movies ever made. The second installment in George Romero's Trilogy is a masterpiece in every way. Great character development, incredible effects by the master of horror Tom Savini, and a wonderful storyline. Anyone who knows anything about real horror movies should not take the idiots who rate this movie one star seriously. Any real fan of horror will surely tell you that Dawn of the Dead ranks up there with the best zombie movies ever made. Do yourself a favor and avoid watching the remake, stick with the original. Also look into Night and Day of the dead.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Ever travelled far enough to experience jet-lag? The feeling of being wide-awake in the middle of the night, and walking around like a zombie when you're supposed to be alert and working? You feel like you're enveloped in cotton wool, like there's a filter between you and the world around you. It can affect you even when you come home, so even your everyday life seems somehow strange, and you begin to look at it in a strange dislocated way.<br />That's just one of the feelings this film captures superbly. Two people coping with less than satisfactory lives find one another in the midst of a world that is strange to them. Probably the young woman's marriage won't last. Her photographer husband is too starstruck and over-awed by his clients. Bob, the actor, has lived enough to see this, and - I think - enough to know that He probably will carry on with his life. <br />There is solace in friendship and finding a kindred spirit. Sometimes it's like having a lifebelt thrown when you need it. Coppola's script is superb and subtle. Some people don't like subtle, which accounts for the number of low reviews here. If you're one of them this isn't a film for you. For everyone else it's an unforgettable and aching experience.

It's is a heart-stopping thriller that keeps you turning pages until you arrive exhausted at the end. You're truly &quot;in on the chase.&quot; Improbable as it seems, Dan Brown has combined nuclear physics and antimatter with Renaissance art, old Rome and the Vatican. You conjure up the images in your mind, but the icing on the cake is Brown's Web site, which shows you the CERN facilities, the plane and then the exquisite artwork of Bernini and others as well as a peek inside the Vatican. It's a book that teaches, makes you think, and entertains, all at the same time. Few authors can accomplish that.<br />If you are open minded and looking for those books begging for its pages to be turned...look no further. Read `Holy Blood, Holy Grail,' and ANYTHING by Ken Follett! I just read a copy of Edgar Fouche's 'Alien Rapture,' which also blew me away. Fouche was a Top Secret Black Program `insider', whose credibility has been verified over and over. Another fun book is Brad Steiger's 'Werewolf.' I also really liked Dan Brown's `Angels and Demons.'

Every song here has never or rarely been perfromed in concert.<br />&quot;Stripped&quot; is a sparse, acoustic live album. Kicking off with the driiving strums of &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot;, every song here is better than the next. &quot;Like A Rolling Stone&quot; beats Dylan's original version by a long shot. They revive their first hit, Buddy Holly's &quot;Not Fade Away&quot;, with a completely different take from the original version by Holly or their subsequent, Bo Didley - style cover. &quot;Shine A Light&quot; is a gospel rave - up from &quot;Exile On Main Street&quot;, while &quot;The Spider And The Fly&quot; is a raunchy 1965 blues. &quot;I'm Free&quot; moves along nicely, while &quot;Wild Horses&quot; is great as always. &quot;Let It Bleed&quot; is fun and sincere, while &quot;Dead Flowers&quot; is fun and insincere. &quot;Slippin' Away&quot; features a powerful Kieth vocal, while &quot;Angie&quot; is just magical. In addition to these 11 tracks, 3 tracks from rehearsals have been added for your listening pleasure. &quot;Love In Vain&quot; has a great Woody slide riff, &quot;Sweet Virginia&quot; sways effortlessly, and Wille Dixon's &quot;Little Baby&quot; ends the album on a high note. <br />This album is truly magical. The Stones once more prove that they always will be The Greatest Rock And Roll Band In The World&quot;.
B00008H2LB|5.0|U people who dont know what good music go and review your crappy bands, and leave us LP fans alone. Someone aparently has way to much time on their hands, one person created at least 10 of basicaly the same review over and over, idiots! <br />BUT, to the review, I think this is an awesome CD, one of my favs, (listening to it right now) I definatly recommend buying it. It will make you an instant LP fan. And you people dissing any of the band, they write all of their own music, unlike ur crack head bands. And *Chester Bennington* has an EXTREME voice!
B000002MUW|5.0|After the controversy surrounding the \\"Justify My Love\\" video, the \\"Sex\\" book and the \\"Erotica\\" album took Madonna's normally cute and innocent sex symbol image over the edge, she realized it was time for her to clean up her act. The result was \\"Bedtime Stories\\", a reflective release that was her last album for four years and a major preview of \\"Ray Of Light\\", which is a classic album.<br />In a way, \\"Bedtime Stories\\" is the last album to feature Madonna's siganture song style. It's the last one to feature anything blatantly sexual or extreme. It's amazing to see how Madonna contradicts herself on the album. On the somber opening track \\"Survival\\", she talks about how she managed overcome great strife and controversy and seems like she's apologizing, then she announces she's not sorry on the freaky but still very good \\"Human Nature\\", which became another hit single for The Material Girl. A little skewed, isn't it? \\"Secret\\" and \\"Take A Bow\\" were the other big hits from the album. In fact, the latter became the biggest hit of her career, staying at # 1 on the Hot 100 for 7 weeks. <br />\\"Bedtime Stories\\" is a highly underrated album that should be rvisited and realized for the great work it contains. It marks the end of Madona's bad - girl image, at the appropiate age of 36. Also, there are several beautiful pictures of Madonna in the booklet that are nice to look at.
B00005JLT5|1.0|Before purchasing this DVD, I didn't know the particulars about statutory rape charges and Roman Polanski. My vote today is not on that legal and moral issue.<BR>As a patron, I purchased what I hoped to be a fresh view regarding an terrible period in human history. I was looking for a new Shindler's List. But this story failed to meet expectations. If I wanted to spend hours listening to fine piano, maybe. But I wanted what lacked here: uniqueness, a tight story, excellent entertainment, and the sensation proclaimed.  It just didn't do it for me.
B00005JME0|5.0|This is definitely one of the most thought provoking movies I've ever seen.It has a very complicated plot where you need to pay attention to the entire movie but once you get it, it's all worth it.I think the previews for this movie really made it seem as if it was scary in a way but it's just a really really intense drama.To me,anyway.Some people might find this movie hard to watch because of some of the intense scenes having to do with death/suicide,violent children,and child pornography;but I believe all that just made the movie more real.The ending of this movie is also great.It's not exactly happy, but it's not completely depressing.I couldn't think of a better way the movie should have ended.I will definitely buy this movie as soon as it is released on DVD.I think it is probably my favorite movie.
B00009M6VJ|5.0|Usually, I am turned off by movies that are over two hours long.  It takes me a long time to put one in the DVD drive.  However, this movie came to me through a DVD circulation club, and the reviews from the group said that this movie was fantastic.  So my husband and I sat down with it shortly after receiving it.<br />The movie captivated me.  At first, I kept picturing Kevin Spacey's character as the same person from &quot;Pay It Forward,&quot; which I also greatly enjoyed.  And Kate Winslet I had just seen in &quot;Quills,&quot; so I just couldn't get over the fact that this was the same person as that (new respect for her -- no longer the damsel in distress from Titanic and Quills).<br />But then, I got caught up in the storyline.  Now, I half-guessed the end (which always gives me the extra thrill -- when it's not TOO blatant; I like playing couch potato Columbo).  However, when I woke up in the middle of the night still thinking about this movie, I knew it had struck a chord.  For me, this was a fine piece of cinema - a book brought to life.  <br />Now for the bad news:  I was disappointed to learn that contrary to popular belief, the story was not a true one.  This always adds something to a movie like this.  I wanted to compare it to Dead Man Walking (I still will -- much better).  <br />But if you like a good drama, I recommend giving this one a try.  Now that I've seen the movie, I found some negative reviews (not so hard to find them).  I maintain that I really enjoyed the movie and did not see any plot holes or hypocrisies, although I can see where those reviewers are coming from.  Still, I urge you to see the movie and then read the negative reviews; even with flaws, I think it's a great movie.
B00005JMNA|1.0|I am sorry, but this movie really disappointed me!  I absolutely Love the original Dirty Dancing, and was expecting a similar athmosphere to be created in this movie as well.  The chemistry between the two main actors is not good, or maybe it was their acting that bothered me.  The dancing was also not that spectacular.  The characters seemed very flat in comparison to Baby and Jhonny.  I just had to leave the theatre...
B00005S6K6|5.0|Hollywood capitalized on the acting talents of DeNiro &amp; Streep by uniting them for this wonderful, well made &amp; clean film. DeNiro &amp; Streep play Frank Raftis &amp; Molly Gilmore, two people who first meet by chance &amp; then by choice. There's only one problem between them - they are both married. It's a genuine dilemma that they face. With a fine supporting cast &amp; an excellent Dave Grusin score, Falling in Love is a winner all the way !
0312263120|1.0|What a book.  It starts with a murder, has a smart good lookin' woman and a smart man, AND an assassin.  Yes, the DaVinci Code....no wait, we were talking about Digital Fortress, weren't we?  All I really need to say is that after four &quot;eye-rolls&quot; in the first three pages, I should have burned this piece of crap (it was borrowed from a friend, thankfully, so I couldn't destroy it).  THREE!  It's THREE you idiots!  That's probably what I'll remember most from this loser.  The only good thing I can say about it is that I didn't waste money on it.
B00008EY9G|5.0|What goes on inside the mind of a madman?  What goes on inside the mind of a homocidal madman?  What goes on inside the mind of a homocidal madman who suffers from delusions and multiple-personality syndrome?  If you are curious as to what any of these answers might be, this movie may be for you.<br />This is the most well-acted film I have seen in quite awhile.  It has two top-shelf male actors in John Cusack and Ray Liotta and the dynamic they create is splendid to watch.  The lovely and talented Amanda Peet rounds out the big names in the flick.<br />I can figure out a lot of thrillers right off the bat.  This one, however, really kept me guessing.  You think you know what's going on, but you really don't.  It's told in a bit of a TWILIGHT ZONEesqe style where Rod Serling seems to be hiding behind every corner.<br />For fans of the thriller / mystery genre, you won't find a better one than this.  It comes in two forms (options on the DVD):  theatrical release &amp; expansion edition.  I would recommend the latter as I don't like it when Hollywood cuts out scenes just for the sake of brevity.<br />If you ever wanted to see an Alfred Hitchcock meets Sigmund Freud movie, here is your chance.  Carl Gustav Jung would have loved this film!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I was appalled that Sofia Coppola won an Oscar for her drab screenplay. First of all, the characters were unsympathetic and out of touch with the world. Are we supposed to empathize with the agony of an actor receiving 2 million dollars for a few days work and a directionless Yale student tagging with her photographer boyfriend? I doubt many of us here have the privilege to be bored in the most expensive hotel in Japan.<br />The stylized ennui of the whole pic was so pretentious. Scarlett's panty shots and endless staring at the window didn't elevate or convey any emotion at all. I really had to force myself awake at times when the whole film veered into an extended travelogue or a home movie. I kept on waiting for the nonexistent plot to arrive.<br />Finally, the 'crocodile dundee' style racism showing the Japanese as one dimensional morons or subservient is really unecessary.  As was the prostitute scene which was just a cheap play for laughs. Much like, most of the Japanese scenes which were the 'look at the wacky Japanese' variety with the help of Bill's snide comments. If Sofia wanted to portray loneliness and isolation, she could have easily done it without the racist undertone.
0380973464|5.0|The first time I read Cryptonomicom, my reaction at the end was very much like other reviewers':  &quot;Where's the rest?&quot;  My next thought was along the lines of, &quot;Almost a thousand pages and it still isn't enough!&quot;  If you can't tell, I personally love this book.  It has wonderful moments of pure hilarity, sometimes embedded in scenes of pure horror, but other times just happily &quot;out there.&quot;  It has plenty of &quot;huh?&quot; moments, resulting in me going back to reread whole sections, sometimes several chapters back in the book, to make sure I was on the right track.<br />The second time I read Cryptonomicon, I had a little better sense of the history portrayed in the book, especially the histories of the fictional characters (and the fictional histories of the real characters).  Knowing how the book ends (or doesn't end, depending on your opinion), I was able to put all of the events into a different context.  Kind of like when you know what the end result of some big world event, and then go back to read the history books of how it happened.  Hindsight, as they say, is 20-20. <br />Just like history, this book reminds us that sometimes stories don't have an ending....
6305327084|5.0|I saw the beginning of this movie on cable and then got HOOKED and had to finish watching the entire movie even though I had two young, restless children in the house. The story is about Timothy Hutton returning home for a reunion but the movie shows little of the reunion event. The story is based around the lives of the characters' everyday lives. The casting is terrific--the acting is superb--especially Natalie Portman. The screenplay is fantastic--the dialogue is witty, natural, realistic and interesting. No cliches in the dialogues. This is a movie I could watch repeatedly and still find it amusing because the screenplay is so good.

0790729725|5.0|The only better gangster flick than this is the godfather, and it gives a run for its money. Heck it might be just as great. The reason that this movie is so good is because its based on a true story, the story of Henry Hill. Through the movie you see how he becomes a gangster and what mistakes he makes in his life. So see this movie than go read the book, Wiseguys, to truely understand the life of Henry Hill
B0001I561E|3.0|When Disney's Aladdin was released on videotape and laserdisc for the first time in October 1993, it debuted with a PC alteration, immediately into the film, as a line from the opening song was changed because of concerns over Arab stereotyping - \\"Where they cut off your ear if they don't like your face\\" became the neutral \\"Where it's flat and immense and the heat is intense\\".<br />As the film makes is debut on DVD later this year, prepare for more changes, albeit subtle.  Just like they did with The Lion King, the Disney team is not using the original theatrical presentation of the film, but a re-issue created for IMAX theatres, which featured some redrawn sequences, supposedly necessary because the original footage in question was problematic on the giant IMAX screen (Examples of the changes to The Lion King can be easily found on the web). The difference this time around is that no one ever saw it.  The IMAX presentations were financially unrewarding to Disney, and Aladdin was never shown.<br />The original release had wonderful color composition, especially in the opening scenes introducing Jafar and the Cave Of Wonders, and Pixar's digital images of The Cave's exterior would foreshadow their upcoming quality feature work that Disney would distribute. As far as casting, it sounds like Robin Williams and Gilbert Gottfried had a great time cutting loose in the studio.<br />With few exceptions, this film is a delight from start to finish.  The  low rating comes from the fact that the original theatrical version will not be used, but the redrawn IMAX version.  It deserves to be part of your collection, but not like this...
B000000OEI|5.0|Undeniably the greatest score even written.<br />Bombastic yet peacefully relaxing, tho' never timid, whilst forever breathing a sense of tender compassion.<br />Mr. Zimmer makes excellent use of the piano, envoking powerful emphasis with deep sustains comprising of single note whilst suppling much of the bass.<br />The Special Effects are exceptionally well used. Never overpowering, which is so common a trait when systhesizers are used to create music.<br />The Sensuous picks upon the guital create a pix of a woman pining as she watches her lover march off to war.<br />The Male choir is exceptional.
B00012QM8G|5.0|Steven Speilberg's Masterpiece is a real eye opener into human evil, and the triumph of the human sprit. An accurate account of the inhumanity of people who would rather blame and condemn those who are of different religious background, and to condone their hatred with unspeakable acts of violence and cruelty.  I glad that this film is finally coming to DVD, because its time to reeducate the public of the most horrifying time in human history. Especially now when people really needed to see it to know the danger of misconception and the horror of misleading propaganda where power does corrupt, even when it involves religion. <br />This is a perfect time for this movie to come out.

But unfortunately the previews showed the only good parts in the whole movie.  I expected a action thriller but was bored to death when this dragged out movie just wouldnt end.  Some action but few and far between.  It was a let down.

B00005JKES|5.0|This DVD of the first season is exceptional.  Sometimes it takes watching these episodes more than one time to really let all of David Lynch's details and exceptional writing sink in.  That is why it is necessary to buy the DVD set.  Twin Peaks was one of the best shows on television and nothing has come close to it since.  Kyle Maclachlan's acting is the best I have ever seen from him. The only thing missing is the pilot episode.  You can buy that separately and that is an important episode to watch, seeing that is where everything begins.  My only question is....WHERE IS THE SECOND SEASON???!!!!?1?  We have been waiting forever for that to be released.  What is the hold up?
B00005JLWN|5.0|I can understand the urge to compare \\"Equilibrium\\" and \\"The Matrix\\". Both films feature dark, foreboding cinematography. Both films are about rebellion against a warped reality. Both films feature a reluctant, messianic protagonist. And, finally, both films rely heavily on stylistic, hyper-kinetic combat scenes that can only be described as, well, reverent. That is where the similarity ends because while \\"Equilibrium\\" has a few moments of slow-motion it's action scenes are much more original than those of \\"The Matrix Trilogy\\". No Wires, just pure crazy choreography which makes the action feel all the more authentic. The environment is also a great deal more organic in contrast to the cryptic automaton of the Matrix.<br />\\"Equilibrium\\", in short, manages to be entirely its own movie. Where The Matrix relies on \\"bending\\" the rules of physics in an imaginary construct of a world, \\"Equilibrium\\" goes the other way and hypothesizes the \\"Gun-Kata\\", a martial arts ballet that allows it's practitioners to predict and anticipate close quarters gun fighting and hand to hand combat. Then, through a series of precise, dance like movements, a person  can take on several combatants, using exacting, fluid actions to eliminate his attackers. Given a decidedly artistic presentation within the course of the film, these rapid-fire rhapsodies are exhilarating and oddly beautiful. They glamorize death as an abstract expression of powder bursts and shrieking projectiles. The film features some of the best choreographed shootouts I have ever seen, and ends up putting anything in The Matrix Trilogy to shame.<br />\\"Equilibrium\\" is a film that explores what it theorizes to be the root of all worldly chaos, human emotion. The movie takes place in the near future after a third world war that leaves Earth on the verge of total destruction. From the ashes arises a government that regulates everything and everyone through mind control. The drug Prozium is hailed as the elixir to the world's problems because it suppresses human emotion and thus eliminates the possibility war. All art, music, poetry and any emotion are considered contraband and must be destroyed upon discovery.<br />The primary clash is between individualism and collectivism -- the notion that each person is an end to him or herself and pursues his or her own happiness, and the theory that the individual exists only to further the interests of the state. In \\"Equilibrium\\", the side of \\"feelings\\" (the side that promotes painting, music, and literature) is the side of the sovereign individual.<br />The film clearly suggests that emotions -- the ability to \\"feel\\" -- are what make life worth living; yet they are also the source of violence and war. At some level, this is clearly true. The joy of art, the intensity of romantic love, the pleasures of a touch or the sight of a sunrise, the fascination of a great idea -- these are the things we live for. \\"Crimes of passion\\" such as murder, domestic violence, and assault generally involve uncontrolled emotions.<br />In \\"Equilibrium\\", murder and war among the civilian population have been wiped out. Of course, they have been replaced by state-sponsored murder and terror. Thus, the film points out the real purpose of deadening people's emotions is to perpetuate state oppression.<br />This nightmare is presided over by the Big Brother-like dictator Father, and enforced by a quasi-religious order of \\"Clericks,\\" whose incredible combat skills are unleashed on \\"sense offenders\\" who have gone off the drugs that keep the populace docile.<br /><br />John Preston (Christian Bale) is the perfect Grammaton Clerick (the government is known as the Tetragrammaton). He kills \\"sense offenders\\" without passion or guilt ... until he inadvertently fails to take his prescribed tranquilizer dose and events begin to catch up with him. Little by little, he finds himself drawn into \\"sense crime\\" and then into the resistance. I hesitate to reveal much more about the plot of \\"Equilibrium\\", jammed as it is with surprise and invention -- suffice to say, this is an intellectual rollercoaster ride, as cerebral as it is visceral; both a bleak glimpse into a possible future and a stirring tribute to the indomitable human spirit.<br />The creators of \\"Equilibrium\\" had to take some liberties with the very idea of emotion, of course. The drug really only eliminates the \\"highs\\" and \\"lows,\\" leaving enough emotive strength for the characters to retain ambition and a visceral hatred of their enemies. Plot means conflict and human conflict is impossible without emotion.<br />The acting is excellent, and if you like Christian Bale as much as I do, he shines above all else. Bale is truly exceptional in bringing a real sense of emotional conflict to the character of Preston, and as the film moves on he gradually brings that emotion to the forefront. At the start of the film, and in it's many flashbacks, Preston is supposed to be this emotionless killer that doesn't realize he's actually feeling subtle emotions. Bale's performance keeps the perfect monotone voice of an emotionless character, but in his eyes shows the doubt, remorse and anger. Then as the films moves on he gradually starts changing his tone of voice, allowing the monotone to falter in key moments, until in the end he completely releases all of his emotions.<br />As you can tell, Equilibrium's plot draws from a rich variety of sources. There's a lot of Orwell's \\"1984\\" and Aldous Huxley's \\"Brave New World\\".<br />True, there are a few minor plot problems, but any movie that treats ideas and symbols seriously these days is a find, and one that pulls off a serious treatment of life's most fundamental questions in the context of a gripping story is a rare jewel.<br />\\"Equilibrium\\" is not science fiction so much as political speculation. It's that mainstay of movies, the cautionary tale, twisted into a decidedly dense and deceptive action thriller. While it may not always deliver in the thought department, we sure get some wonderful visual flourishes. And if a sci-fi film can stir your imagination, it's won most of the battle.<br />The creation of the enigmatic weapons battle dance, \\"Gun-Kata\\", makes the movie a see at least once exercise in speculative movie making.brium\\", jammed as it is with surprise and invention -- suffice to say, this is an intellectual rollercoaster ride, as cerebral as it is visceral; both a bleak glimpse into a possible future and a stirring tribute to the indomitable human spirit.<br />The creators of \\"Equilibrium\\" had to take some liberties with the very idea of emotion, of course.

B0000AQVCL|5.0|I have not heard a rock record like this since the Oasis album Definately Maybe.  Its upbeat and tight.  I kept playing the cd over and over again, it rocks.  I here a combination of Oasis, the Stones, Kinks and AC/DC.  This is what rock should sound like.  Liam and Noel Gallagher attended the London show to see them and Keith Richards loves the album, they even opened for the Stones in Australia, there huge in England and Europe and there up and coming here, so if they come to your town, don't miss it cause you'll regret it..........Rock on!!!!!!!!

The only thing they could have made better about this album was to put the song &quot;Are You Experienced&quot; on their, but that is just a minor detail. All in all, this is a great cd.

0064407667|5.0|People lacking a sense of humor, a sense of irony, and a sense of the whimsical do not get these books.  People lacking an understanding of the intelligence of children do not like these books.  And people lacking the comprehension that sometimes a story is good simply because it turns classical conventions on their head do not understand these books.  \\"The Series of Unfortunate Events\\", ever popular and entirely urbane, began here in 1999 with the simple story.  \\"The Bad Beginning\\".  They have been making cool millions ever since.<br />Elegantly bound and rendered beautiful by artist Brett Helquist's adept illustrations, the books tap into that sense of macabre that lurks at the heart of every girl and boy.  Picking up the book, the reader is instantly told not to read the thing.  Says its back, \\"It is my sad duty to write down these unpleasant tales, but there is nothing stopping you from putting this book down at once and reading something happy, if you prefer that sort of thing\\".  It's the old reverse psychology ruse.  Tell the children not to read the story and they'll come screaming at you for more.  The story itself is simple.  The three newly orphaned Baudelaire siblings have been sent to their nearest relative to live; one nasty Count Olaf.  Prepared to do whatever it takes to get his hands on the Baudelaire fortune (a fortune the children themselves cannot inherit until the eldest, Violet, is of age) the Count makes the children's lives miserable, even as he schemes to get their moolah.  Don't think, however, that the children are entirely helpless.  Using their cunning and special skills the kids are more than adequate adversaries to Count Olaf and it is due to their brains that they are able to fight another day.<br />The book uses a lot of classic motifs to appeal to its young readership.  Often the narrator will address the reader directly, either imploring them to go do something cheerier or defining unfamiliar terms for them.  Author Daniel Handler (pen name Lemony Snicket) is an adept writer.  Though the Count is threatening and dislikable, his violence is mostly implied rather than overt (with some definite exceptions).  Kids are safe reading this series and, though they do encounter corpses once in a while, nothing too terrible ever befalls the children.<br />The mystery behind the series has yet to be revealed.  Certainly there are many loose ends to be tied up by the end of these books (there will be, the ever apt, 13 in all).  How did the children's parents die?  Who is Lemony Snicket, the omniscient narrator?  All will be revealed in time.  Meanwhile, look forward to the upcoming movie with Jim Carrey as the Count.

B0000019HU|5.0|As a friend referred to it, this album sounds &quot;raw, yet professional.&quot; The mysterious Kentucky quartet Slint is one of those bands that happened at just the right time and produced a stellar album that probably can't be duplicated. No other band has sounded like this before or since, although I find some parallels in the music on this album to some of the things done by Tool. Slint's use of dynamics was so far ahead of its time that bands and musicians are still trying to catch up. From the opening harmonics of &quot;Breadcrumb Trail&quot; to the closing explosive &quot;I miss you(s)&quot; of &quot;Good Morning, Captain,&quot; this album has to be heard. Julian McMahan's sung/spoken delivery of the lyrics seem to fit right into the mix perfectly, while Britt Walford's drumming is almost mathematical in its precision. A masterpiece.
0316236535|4.0|I've enjoyed reading through the vast variety of responses to this book, and mostly they bring up some interesting points. &quot;Go Away Big Green Monster&quot; is ostensibly a book that is meant to (and I'm quoting the back of the book here) &quot;chase away their (kids') nighttime monsters&quot;. All well and good. This doesn't give the book much in the way of plot development or character analysis, but it sure does create one heckuva scary bed time monster. By flipping through the pages the book slowly creates, then disposes with a big green boogie man.<br /><br /> I was a bit amazed at the cut out construction of this tale. It's cleverly done and expertly woven. But as some reviews of this book have pointed out, it's probably a book best written for kids who ALREADY are afraid of big green monsters. If you've a child who's never considered that monsters might be out there with &quot;a big red mouth with sharp white teeth&quot; this might suddenly inspire them to become afraid for the first time. Sort of the antithesis of what the book is supposed to accomplish. I mean, it's a cute book. No question. Just make certain that you're handing it to a little one that is not innocent in the ways of monsters and monster appearance.<br /><br /> Oh, and as a personal side note, I love the cover. The big green monster stares out at the viewer in a perfect Kilroy-esque appearance (his big ole nose hanging like a blue cucumber over the yellow wall). Any book that references Kilroy is a-okay by me.
B00006RU5B|3.0|This new quartet of hard rocking musicicans is quite a surprise to many soundgarden and RATM fans. A fan of soundgarden, and having a small interest in RATM, I had to check this out for myself.<br />However, I was a tad bit disappointed with the rather boring undeveloped song structure in these songs. A lot of the songs sound the same, and the album as a whole just seems to get all the more boring as the songs continue. I do agree that the music is VERY hard-edged and a bit grungy at times, but I never really liked Tom Morello's style all that much, though no doubt it's very unique, the guitar/record scratching lines just don't hit home with me.<br />The only songs that really impress me on this album are &quot;Show Me How To Live&quot;, &quot;What You Are&quot;, &quot;Like A Stone&quot;, &quot;Shadow Of the Sun&quot;, &quot;I Am The Highway&quot;, &quot;Getaway Car&quot;, and &quot;The Last Remaining Light&quot;. The last four songs sound almost identical to something Soundgarden would release. The rest of the songs just seem slopped together with a bunch of distorted guitar and heavy drumming. Chris Cornell is a great singer with a great voice...I just wish some of the lyrics made sense.<br />So overall, this unique effort doesn't even match up to Soundgarden, at least in my opinion, but fans of nu-rock and nu-metal might want to give it a try. It's definately much better than the other junk that they call music on the radio these days, so that's a huge plus.  I think a solo effort from Chris Cornell would be a great move.
0060245867|5.0|\\"If You Give a Mouse a Cookie\\" really has been the \\"It\\" book for some time.  Parents love this story, and their children really get into it as well.  On and off, I'd heard various things about it, but nothing that so sparked my interest that I ran to my nearest library to peruse its pages.  Now, however, I've grown old and wise in the ways of kiddie lit. and I found myself wanting to know what all the fuss was about.  Was this book really as overwhelmingly fantastic as everyone said?  Was I doomed to fall desperately in love with it like 98% of the population of known Western Civilization?  The answer is a resounding yes yes yes.  I had counted on finding some mild enjoyment with a fun story.  Was I got was extreme enjoyment from a sly, understated, exceedingly clever story.<br />As we open, a small mouse treks down a hill on its own as a boy contentedly reads his comic book, munching on a bag of delicious chocolate chip cookies.  After the boy offers the mouse a cookie (not knowing what such an action has wrought) the mouse asks for milk.  Milk leads to a napkin.  A napkin leads to a mirror (to check for a milk mustache, of course).  A mirror leads to a hasty haircut.  A haircut leads to sweeping up.  And so on.  All the while the boy gamely follows his rodent friend over, around, and through the different parts of the house, ever supplying the guest with whatsoever it may require.  By the end, the house is in shambles, the boy exhausted on the floor (parents will relish this picture above all) and the mouse has just started in on a second cookie.<br />Some books expertly place kids in the position of their parents.  In the picture book, \\"Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus\\", kids are allowed to finally tell someone (the someone in that instance being a naughty pigeon) no.  In this book, the kids are now the patient parents, forever cleaning up and amusing the endlessly enthusiastic and hepped-up mousey.  The pictures are deceptively simple, drawn with pure pen and ink.  Just the same, millions of tiny details are apparent in every shot.  The boy's refrigerator displays (oddly) a newspaper clipping of a car crash.  The mouse's drawing of his family displays some pretty original dresses on his mother and sister.  And I'll leave up to your imagination the variety of odds n' ends surrounding the depleted boy at the end of the story.  Suffice to say, ladies and gentlemen, this book has it all.  And it's a delightful story to boot.ink.  Just the same, millions of tiny details are apparent in every shot.  The boy's refrigerator displays (oddly) a newspaper clipping of a car crash.

B00018D44U|3.0|While this CD is a worthy effort, I believe Norah needs to expand her horizons.  Her sound seems to be stuck in some sort of country-western warp.  As I sit hear listening to Miles Davis, I can ONLY hope that she attempts to explore her jazz instincts much more on her next endeavor along the lines of Diana Krall or Cassandra Wilson.
0385510438|5.0|I have to admit the last few books from John Grisham didn't exactly &quot;grab my attention&quot; to put it mildly.  But this book made me have faith in Mr. Grisham's ability to get to an audience once again.<br />Set in a small town in Clanton, Mississipi, Willie Traynor is not at first accepted by the townspeople.  After a while, though, he is accepted by both the white and black population.  But through one of his editorials, he does a human interest story on a black woman and her seven children that all obtained Phds.  While doing an interview with this woman, they become the closest of friends.<br />The book centers around the rape and murder of a young widow and mother.  The crime was committed by Danny Padgitt, the Padgitt family that lives on an island and can literally get away with murder.  But Danny is the first Padgitt actually convicted of a crime.  After the trial is over and he is finally found guilty, he threatens the jury and tells them that he is going to get each and every one of them.  <br />The jury has a choice, death or life in prison.  After much debate, they decide life in prison.  Most people don't understand that &quot;Life&quot; in Clanton usually means ten years.<br />Danny is released after nine years, and it seems as though he is carrying through with his threats.  This is where the books takes a surprising turn.  There are several deaths, is Danny carrying out his threats?<br />I thorougly enjoyed this book and would recommend it.  What got to me most was the ending.<br />Recommend to anyone
B00005JMJ4|3.0|There are some movies where the story, background, and other important devices are totally superfluous, and the only focal point is the characters. \\"Lost in Translation\\" is just such a movie. It would probably have worked just as well as a stage play, considering that the movie is basically about two characters. While the praise and Oscar nods may have raised my expectations, I found this movie to be average and insubstantial, but with good performances that elevate it from the status of a fluff piece.<br />Bill Murray plays perhaps his best performance as Bob Harris, a middle-aged actor who has past his prime, no longer happy in his marriage, and doing a whisky advertisement in Tokyo. Scarlett Johansson plays Charlotte, a recent university graduate who is at a loss for what to do with her life, and has come to Tokyo with her husband, a celebrity photographer, hoping that the change of scenery will spark something within her. Of course, it doesn't. Both are in similar states of drudgery, and in Japan, a culture so far removed from their own, their unhappiness takes centre stage. Predictably, the two hit it off and find life in each other, even though it is known from the start that nothing can happen between the two of them. They are both married (albeit unhappily), and one is old enough to be the other's father. They story is very simple, how two people in a strange environment can find each other. I didn't walk away from this movie feeling uplifted or saddened, which was disappointing considering all the critical hoopla surrounding it.<br />Bill Murray is the main attraction here, taking a lead from other comedic actors who are making a switch to more dramatic roles in their autumn years. He is really good here, playing a more subdued role, while still maintaining a dry sense of humor. Scarlett Johansson is also good in her respective role, though her performance is hardly Oscar material. Aside from the two performances, there is very little to this movie to recommend. The script by Sofia Coppola is well devised, but in a year with so many other great movies, I find it hard to accept that this was the best screenplay. On a sad note, the humor in \\"Lost in Translation\\" does not come from the actors or the script, but from mocking Japanese people and customs. I was not offended, but found it sad that this was the singular source of comic relief in a movie that was supposed to be the best thing since sliced bread.<br />The DVD package is pretty light on the extras, but what it provided is pretty good. The interview with Sofia Coppola and Bill Murray is well done, and you get an appreciation for the passion they put into this movie. The \\"Lost in Location\\" documentary is nice, but nothing overly interesting occurs. It is a run of the mill behind the scenes piece. Fans expecting something more extensive might be disappointed, since there is no commentary or any other substantial featurettes. I think this was released to cash in on the Oscar hype, so a special edition is likely in the near future.<br />\\"Lost in Translation\\" works are a decent character drama, but not a great one. I guess it said more to some than others, but I expected a lot more from this movie. I found the acting to be superb, but the implausible story and unfunny attempts to inject humor through stereotype dragged this movie down for me. As in many cases, the hype did not deliver the payoff. Don't get me wrong ,this is not a bad movie. It is good, but nothing special.mmend.

B00000DR5W|5.0|It is hard to define what kind of musician Ryuichi Sakamoto really is;  his musical style has changed so much throughout his long career which started in 70s.  Outside Japan, his native country, Sakamoto probably is best (yet barely) known for his much acclaimed film scores (e.g., The Last Emperor), but to me his most interesting work came during the late 80s and early 90s, when he began collaborating with authentic ethnic musicians from Okinawa, India, and so on.<br />This kind of music never gets played in radio, and I think it really is a shame.  Those who really wish to expand their musical taste bud should actually start exploring stuff like this that never gets played even in college radio stations.  Beauty offers music that is earthly yet sophisticated enough that any music lover with a taste for appreciating different kinds of \\"beauties\\" can find interesting --- it is no way \\"experimental\\" music that is often just another word for boring music.  If anything, Beauty should have been the springboard for Sakamoto's career outside his native country --- too bad it did not work out that way.  Yet, Sakamoto, to me, is one of the most creative musicians that came out during the unforgettable 80s.  Beauty is the distillation of his creativity in his most prolific era, I think.<br />Another cool album, if you like this one, is Neo Geo --- where Sakamoto's ethnic fusion all started, I guess.  While I personally think Neo Geo lacks the kind of sophistication that you can hear throughout in Beauty, it instead has that appeal of cutting-edge electronic music which came out in 80s.
B00011RPB0|2.0|I had high expectations for this film. Its reviews were almost uniformly positive. God knows why. It has its moments, even some beautiful and touching interludes, but for the most part it is stupefying.<br />Bill Murray spends most of the movie wearing a blank, disinterested expression, when he's not having monosyllabic conversations with his Japanese hosts or muttering into his cellphone. Scarlett Johannson spends her time trying to devise different ways to depict hanging out in a hotel room and bar. Watching a bank of hotel security monitors would be more interesting.<br />There are two worthwhile scenes. In one, Murray and Johannson are lying beside each other, face up in bed, talking about what it's like to be married. In one of the DVD extras (Murray and the film's director, Sofia Coppola, are standing on a roof in Rome, talking about the film), Murray calls it one of the finest scenes of his career, and says it marks the point where a viewer will really become interested in the story. For me, the scene showed the film wasn't a complete disaster. The second scene is when Murray and Johannson last see each other. It's touching and well done.<br />The movie does give an extended look at Tokyo. I finished the movie with mild interest in visiting there. <br />Don't believe the hype. Don't repeat my mistake and buy this DVD. Don't waste your time watching it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A friend showed me the complete series, and I've watched them all 3 more times.  I miss the characters and the amazingly witty dialogue.  Take my word for it, it's a delight to watch.  Buy it!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|The best CD in my whole collection. Britney rocks!
B00005JN02|4.0|With films like \\"Good Bye, Lenin!\\", both the critics' and viewers' darling in Europe (winner of Felix for Best European Film and French Cesar for Best EU Film of 2003), you should put your logic to rest -- this is a black comedy which crumbles under strict common sense; but when you try to understand its point of view, you may relish in the \\"American Beauty\\"-lite distorted story with lots of truth hidden inside.<br />Alex (Daniel Bruehl) is a 20-something young man, whose mother, on the surface a devoted citizen of communist East Germany, suffers a heart attack, having witnessed a protest in October 1989. After she 'wakes up' eight months afterward, the communist regime is gone and the unification of Germany after 42 years of split is pending. But Alex, afraid of a crushing blow this reality would mean for her, takes great pains to persuade his bed-ridden mom that German Democratic Republic is still a reality -- he gets out-of-use groceries for her, shows her old-times video footage and gets 'enthusiastic' neighbors playing their roles to achieve the goal. Yet we feel that the moment the mother Christiane (Katrin Sass) finally finds out what's going on, is imminent.<br />Director Wolfgang Becker skilfully and un-pathetically intertwines two layers of a story -- the real fate of this particular family is far from happy and is in a strange, thought-provoking contrast with the comedian bulk of the story. The film's sober bitter-sweetness confirms that almost nothing in this world is only black or only white.<br />Although the potential of the movie to let outsiders feel what it really meant for ordinary people to live on the wrong side of Berlin Wall is a bit questionable (although favored, \\"Good Bye, Lenin!\\" was snubbed at Oscar nominations), it's already one of the definitive film (and artistic) statements of Germany's unifying process and may well prove essential for students of German and maybe even Eastern Europe's history in the 20th century.
0671799320|4.0|This book is one of the best around for historical information on the petroleum industry.  It is put together in a very good chronological and logical manner that links many events and things together with each other through their common link of petroleum.  It has a great deal of information on many of the leading petroleum producing nations of the world.  Overall, it is a book that makes very enjoyable reading on the history and development of the petroleum industry and its importance in politics and economics.  I would have given this book a five star rating if it had including much more information and deserved attention on the country of Canada and its petroleum industry since it is one of the biggest suppliers of petroleum to the United States.  Also, mention of the diesel engine in its relationship as a solution to higher cetane vs octane fuels as found in early discovered petroleum is another important fact. It is hoped that if the author writes a revised version of his book that these things be considered.
B00004Y6Q5|5.0|This is one of the few CD's that I own that I never get tired of listening to.  The only problem lies with the fact that the songs are excruciatingly short.  If I could find a CD with an 8 minute rendition of the song &quot;Requiem&quot; in it's entirety I'd give an arm and a leg for it.  If anyone knows of one out there let us know.<BR>This is truly a new classic and enjoyed by ten if listened to after the movie.

B00005OAIE|2.0|John Mayer's &quot;Room For Squares&quot; has been recorded with little imagination. At first, you'll get excited thinking that you'll get more songs like &quot;Love Song For No One&quot; or &quot;No Such Thing&quot; but honestly halfway through the album can get you dozing off to wonderland. 2 stars for the light voice Mayer has and another one for the effort, but the album (for me) failed to create an impression and I thought that after listening to the whole CD over and over again, it will soon grow on me, but it wasn't to be. &quot;Room For Squares&quot; must be substituted with an album from Rob Thomas or Stephan Jenkins from Third Eye Blind. Try those two instead. Mayer is nothing special.
B00011RPB0|1.0|This has got to be the most boring movie I have ever watched.  I just kept waiting for it to get better but it never did.  It was a waste of my time and all the plots lines they could have pursued, they didn't.  It was a major disappointment since I like Bill Murray and the previews for this movie made it seem a lot different than it was.  Of all the people I have talked to that have seen it, I don't know a single one that actually liked it.  Not a good choice Bill.
B0000CAQ26|1.0|I have liked Pink before when her image at the &quot;Can't Take Me Home&quot; album is still being patronized. The songs are good as well... &quot;You Make Me Sick&quot; and &quot;Most Girls&quot;. Now she has matured and certainly went away from being dirty to FAR MORE DIRTY! In her &quot;Trouble&quot; video, the whole point of the clip was to make chaos in which Pink would enter a western bar and beat everyone up, then she ends up truimphant. She just wants to show that she's tough! a tomboy I must say! Almost the same attempt was done for the video of &quot;God Is A DJ&quot;. First of all, Pink can't sing and that's a fact. I'll give her a star for she's a good dancer and that's basically about it! YUCK!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Series cancelled mid-way through season. Network decides to screen episodes out of order. Series will not be bought by local networks. Sounds like a Firefly's a mess, right?<P>Wrong. Having immensely enjoyed Angel and Buffy, I figured I'd give this doomed series a chance and bought the box set from Amazon. And I have just spent an enjoyable weekend watching every episode in one hit.<P>A wonderfully quirky and cheesy premise is the springboard for yet another off-beat examination of humans learning about others and themselves. Just relax and let the crew of Serenity change your expectations of westerns and sci-fi. A very good ensemble cast bring to life scripts that are by turns funny, poignant and intelligent.<P>This is a very good series that, had it been given a chance, may well have become great. In addition to 14 really good episodes of Firefly, you get an excellent documentary that examines the series' brief life, built around candid interviews with the producers, writers and cast. The other extras are Ok but this is the pick of them.<P>If you're looking for something a cut above an actor with a bit of face paint uttering &quot;engage the transwarp patillion conduit&quot;, buy this - you won't regret it.
0380729407|5.0|For someone in search of a dark read, this is it.  The poetic prose of Ray Bradbury swept me off of my feet and into the small town in Illinois country where the midnight carnival arrived with it's empty promises and tantalizing shows.  Bradbury shows us how people can be good or evil, and that the choice remains in every person; he also provides beautiful examples of how joy and imagination triumph over fear and doubt.  He uses the carnival as a symbolic representatation of what happens to people who allow themselves to drift in the past and not make progress towards future happiness.  Bradbury alludes to several of his earlier writings, tying together many of his other works into this chilling novel.  Even if you have never read Bradbury's work before, this book holds great insite into the world and the individual within it.
B000F8O2PG|3.0|Season Six and Season Ten were the worst seasons of Stargate SG-1. Not only did we miss out on Daniel Jackson (for the most part), having an \\"alien\\" like Jonas Quinn that was more American than the Russian team members in \\"Metamorphosis\\" was inexcusable. In that episode, by the way, the Russians pass through the Stargate and still speak Russian. (If the stargate programmed one's speech, or language, to match the worlds to which it was connected, it should have made the Russians perfectly easy to understand once they had passed through its event horizon.) But the Russians couldn't communicate with the world's inhabitants while the Americans could.<br /><br />The best episodes were the ones with guest appearances by Michael Shanks. Jonas pulled down the season, but it's still worth owning, even if one has to swallow an \\"American\\" alien.<br /><br />Dumb idea, but the show recovered and even survived the addition of the insufferable Ben Browder and Claudia Black, who, unlike Browder, grew on you.

B00007AJF8|2.0|This movie is a perfect example of how you shouldn't take drugs before writing scripts. The first part was amusing but bizarre; the second half ruined the first half by introducing sexual perversion. If you are going to take drugs and write scripts, please use the SAME drug and don't mix them randomly.<br />This could have been a great movie, and there are some good spots, but essentially it's a waste of time. Get something better, like Amazon Women from Mars.
B00008IAMD|5.0|I love this CD. I think the mixture of new material (&quot;The Man Comes Around&quot;) along with the hit &quot;Hurt&quot;; mixed with traditional ballads and western (&quot;Give My Love to Rose&quot;, &quot;Sam Hall&quot;, &quot;Streets of Loredo&quot;) music gives the album quite an interesting mixture. Also included is the &quot;Hurt&quot; video. Being a long long time Johnny Cash fan, it was alarming to see how poor his health was, but this is one of the most powerful songs and videos I have ever ever seen. I HIGHLY recommend this CD and still mourn at his passing :-(
B000002GY9|5.0|On this album Tom takes the listener to the same place &quot;Notes from the Underground&quot; takes the reader.  It's a real world that daylight doesn't penetrate and heartbroken loners like Mr. Waits portrays wander the darkened streets alone.  Anyone with a broken heart can relate to &quot;Tom Taubert's Blues&quot; and enjoy the fact that misery loves company and the singer is sharing a bench with you.  In other words, this ain't no party cd.  This is for listening and learning about another way of life.
B0000C7PQK|5.0|I've spent many a night listening to Enigma and own all of their cd's.  Michael Cretu is simply amazing and Vogageur is another example of his creativity. Many people envision Enigma from the early accomplishments and don't appreciate Enigma's later hits. <br />At first I was hesitant with the contrasting styles exhibited, but the more I listened the more intriguing it became. Vogageur rates #2 on my list of Enigma compilations behind their third cd Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi! The highlights on Voyageur are Tracks 1,2,4,5,7 and 11. Track 1 has an pulsating beat that is extremely catchy. From a vocal standpoint, Track 11 is very &quot;Enigmatic&quot; sounding. <br />A friend of mine, a first time listener of Enigma, was hooked after the first track of Voyageur. Normally he listens to bands like The Doors, Led Zepplin, Pete Yorn and Cake, so this was quite a switch for him. If you're already an experienced Enigma listener, don't give up on Cretu yet. Close your eyes and appreciate the experience created by this wonderful cd.<br />Note to Cretu: Your next project should be a remix of Enigma trance style!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Ok, to someone who's deciding whether to get this or not, here's what I hope is a useful review. I'm not the kind of reviewer who just writes how much I hate Britney or how much I love her. First, ignore these one-star reviews. They're written either by rock fans who just can't stand Britney or by people who haven't listened to the CD only because they hate her. All these one-star reviews are very biased and cannot help you decide whether you should get the CD because they're only about why they hate Britney and not about the CD.<BR>First of all, are you the pop/rnb/hiphop kinda fan? If you like that sort of music, go ahead and get this one. If you are a rock fan, forget this.<BR>Next, do you like new kinds of sounds and different kinds of beats and some fresh sounds? Yes? Add this to your shopping cart now. <BR>Do you just want to have some dancy music playing in your Cd player? And all lyrics don't have to be very serious. They're pretty ok lyrics and actually very good for Britney. <br />There're a lot of different tempos, moods and stuff in here. I mean one minute she's singing about her against the music is a very classic club way with Madonna (she's pretty ok on the song but still unwanted. I'm just glad she didn't attack toxic), then jumps over to her boom boom with an excellent southern hip hop beat (with the Ying yang twins who're fun until they get too loud) and moves over to an excellent beat supported song - 'Showdown' where she's singing about play sex. Next, she's singing to her lover about connecting to her by breathing on her with great Kylie Minogueish beats (I doubt Kylie's ability of coming up with a great song like this). Then we have the Moby-produced Early Morning which is excellent pure hip hop after which the girl who just sang about a party hangover jumps over to a great 60s beat with Toxic (Warning - Very toxic song. Cannot listen to next song till you've repeated listening to this song at leat thrice) where she's singing about the how addicted she is to her boyfriend and that he's toxic. I like this Video too. I think it's the best one of hers so far. After toxic comes the R,Kelly produced Outrageous. Nice hip hop but I don't like the lyrics too much. Then she sings about playing with herself supported by fresh chinese music which sounds very good. After that, Britney Spears actually does Reggae. Believe me it's great! Very strange and wierd too but very catchy and sounds slightly like Beyonce's baby boy. The tempo slows down when she jumps over to the first ballad - Shadow where she expresses her vocal ability well. The lyrics are about the unreal presence of her lover and the Matrix have done a good job with the beats. Then she travels back to her baby one more time days with Brave new girl where she sounds like Madonna. The lyrics are ok and are about her coming out of her shell and becoming strong after which is her sorry to her ex. Everytime is the best ballad ever. Though there are no drums, the harp and the piano are very providing and her tearful voice and sweet lyrics bring an excellent mood to the song. Then is the remix of MATM which has a very catchy Indian punjabi beat. I love this remix a lot and I'm sure you will too if you like Indian sort of music. <BR>Over all from a pop fan,
B000068FUS|4.0|There was a lot of positive hype surrounding this CD when it was released.  It's easy to understand the positive publicity.  This is a band that wears its redneck heritage on its sleeve and then some.  Their songs have a good southern funk and their lyrics are often inciteful.<br />The problem is that these guys seem too restricted in choosing to go the concept album route.  The entire first CD seems to be about nothing but Alabama and Skynyrd.  Sorry, but it gets a bit old.  It isn't until the second CD that the DBT seem to find their groove.  Don't be fooled by those who say these guys are the heir apparent to Skynyrd and The Allman Bros.  Far from it.  There is a bit of both those bands in these guys, but they resist (for better or for worse) the extended jams and solos.  Musically, they are more in line with the alt-country movement and Uncle Tupelo than they are their 70s icons.  And frankly, this is a good thing.<br />This CD is good, but for a better example of how good these guys can be, go with Decoration Day.
0140177396|5.0|i'm a high school student, one who doesn't normally read \\"classics\\" (if this could be called one, i'm not sure, after all, i don't READ EM, usually), last year in 11th grade english i wasn't doing so well, so i had to do some extra credit reading, and i chose of mice and men from a list of 19 other, less appealing books. I never got around to reading it until the next year however, which i guess was better since, i like reading on my own accord, rather than for school. I'm a stubborn person like that. Its a short read, about 120 pages, i think. I thought since i had to buy the book, i might as well read it, i can get it in one sitting, and be done with it. With titles like \\"east of eden\\" and \\"grapes of wrath\\", i really didn't think i'd like it, i mean \\"east of eden\\" is in oprahs book club, and everything about oprah's show disgusts me. Before you judge me, on that statement on oprah, keep in mind i'm a 16 year old, a kid. But back to the point, i read the story. <BR>     What really scared me about the book (before i read it) was that it is required reading for some american literature classes. And from my experiences, english classes, have done nothing but to scare people away from books, that all good books, are just complex masses of hard-to-get symbols, metaphors, imagery, blah blah blah. <BR>     So thats what i went into the book expecting, to be confused the whole way through because of my inadequate reading skills. But since it was so short, i thought i'd survive at least. The first page and the half of the second page, was describing the landscape, which started to scare me. But once the characters were introduced, it was loads easier to get through. What caught me was that the dog character from looney tunes, the one that always gets fooled by the squirrel hes supposed to chase, sounded alot like lennie \\"which way did he go, george? which way did he go?\\", you should know what i mean. <BR>    What i really liked about the book was how human it was, especially in a negative sense. Being somewhat of an misanthrope (not REALLY, but i'm not exactly the most optimistic person ever), i enjoyed steinbeck's crack on human nature. Lennie, being too small-minded to use his own judgement, of whats right or wrong, what'll help or harm, whats too much or too little, what to be scared of, what to do, relies on other people's wills, in a mother-son, father-son kind of way. But since, it is an grown man (a STRONG man), the problems of his dependence on others are much more serious (such as murder).<BR>     Just read it, its only about 8 dollars, if you don't like it, then its not that much of a loss, but if you give it a chance, on your time, rather than because of a school assignment, you'll probably like it.

B00008LDPU|2.0|I am a Matrix fanatic, but, after buying and watching this DVD, I was left feeling a little cheated.  True, the films are visually beautiful, and they shed some (very little) insight into the Matrix (I II &amp; III) story and characters, but I thought this DVD fell pretty flat as a whole package.  The films are not very tied together (you can really tell there were different authors) and the stories are more like teasers.<br />Save your money - rent this one if you are really curious!
0553801546|3.0|After NINE books, I was looking forward to some answers to a few questions, one huge one of which Hobb leaves hanging, making me wonder if she's coming back to the series at a later date. I hope so, since the ending left me not only cold, but resentful. <br />The book is well paced and well written, and as with all Hobb books, I have teared up unexpectedly and then laughed a few pages later. The character of Thick is so gently drawn, and the Fool is one of my favorite fantasy characters, reminding me in a way of Agent Pendergast from Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child's books. <br />But Fitz, poor Fitz, &quot;poor me&quot; Fitz- he was never meant for a storybook ending. Life isn't that way, and I really, truly feel like Hobb copped out. I was left holding the book, looking for a postscript, SOMETHING, to remove my utter distaste and disbelief at what I had just read. <br />It's a magnificent series of books, all nine, but to me, the ending was a revolting letdown!
0440237688|3.0|In the book, a boy named Jonas becomes the Receiver for his town when he turns twelve and finds out the truth from The Giver. The story takes place in a community that is not normal. Everything is in order and everything is under control. The people have no worries and cares. Everyone is equal and everyday is the same. Each member in Community is assigned a position. When Jonas turns 12, the Community selects him to be the new receiver of memories. Only The Giver knows the truth and memories of the past, and now he must pass these memories on to Jonas. When he finds out the truth that how his father releases babies, it makes Jonas hate his family because his dad kills innocent babies by injecting poison into them. This point of change made him run away from his home, where the story ends questioning what would happen next. I really enjoyed reading this book because it was a wonderful adventurous book. And if you enjoy reading adventurous book, you definitely have to try this one.

B00009Y3L4|1.0|While this is probably not a bone of contention with most viewers, I think it's worth noting for those that do pay attention to these things, especially if you base your purchases on them, as I did in this case.  The packaging on this newer DVD edition of &quot;Cabaret&quot; states that it is an anamorphic transfer (i.e. &quot;Enhanced for Widescreen TVs&quot;).  It is NOT.  This is the SAME disc as before, with new a label on it.<br />They merely changed the packaging, I guess, so that they could mention &quot;Chicago&quot; in the description on the back cover and tie it into the heat for that film.  Shame on you, Warner Bros.  We all work hard for our money and deserve better than to believe we're buying a new anamorphic transfer, when you are really marketing the exact same discs as before.
0385507755|3.0|I had high hopes for this book, but it's falling short of my expectations...how many times do I want to hear about basically the same thing (i.e. I want a drink, I really want a drink, I want to do drugs, etc.) Also, there are a couple of style points that I wish were different: Frey doesn't use any quotation marks, which makes it difficult to understand if the character is saying the lines or simply thinking them; and I dislike the overuse of capital letters (Friends, Room, Street Corner, Rock Star, etc. are all capitalized no matter where they fall in the sentence -- this doesn't add anything to the story). Not a bad book, but not worthy of all the 5 star ratings, IMO.
B0000CABBW|5.0|It's all about the determination of a girl to become something that her grandfather wants but can't have from a girl because of their tribes culture and sacred traditions. I found this movie to be heart warming and Keisha Castle-Hughes performance as a shunned young girl to becoming someone looked up to, to be among the best of 2003. The supporting actors and actresses did not come up short either. The music, although sometimes haunting had some high points like the ending called &quot;Go Forward&quot;. Kudos to Lisa Gerrard.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|I can't deny that Bill Murray and Scarlett Johanson (Johansen?) had a certain chemistry, and there were a few moments that were funny and sad at the same time, but the overwhelming feeling from seeing this movie is the same trapped, bored feeling that the lead characters felt. Yes, we get it, Japan is a foreign culture and they both feel trapped in their lives. <br />I saw this movie because it was on so many &quot;Best&quot; lists, and the reviews used words like &quot;hilarious&quot; and &quot;heartfelt.&quot; Don't be fooled. This is not hilarious. It may be heartfelt, but the dazed and sleepy dialogue really threatens to leave you with eyes glazing over, desperately wanting something to happen. <br />Here's the secret: it's a cute character study, but nothing ever happens.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|Wow, the story to this sequel was much better than the first and it introduces us to very awesome character \\"Nightcrawler\\" who seems to only kick butt when he is in a different state of mind. If you don't know what I mean then you must watch the opening scene and if you haven't seen the opening scene, it's a must see for any action fan, one of the best action scenes, hands down. Characters get more development in this movie and the story makes you want to watch till the very end. Now I want more.

B000089RVX|5.0|I absolutely love this album. Everything about it is great- the music, the lyrics, Amy Lee's amazing voice. It's just perfect.

B00005JM02|5.0|Nemo is the only surviving child of Marlin, a clown fish without a sense of humor.  Marlin is so afraid of loosing Nemo that he is extremely over protective.  On Nemo's first day of school, he is kidnapped and taken to an aquarium in a dentist's office.  Marlin sets of to find and rescue his son, teaming with Dory.  Dory has her own issues; she has short-term memory loss.  Along the way, they meet up with some sharks trying to kick the meat habit (&quot;Fish are friends, not food.&quot;), a school of fish that does impressions, and some surfer dude sea turtles.  Nemo, meanwhile, must work with the others to escape from the tank into the ocean before Darla comes to take him away.<br />Pixar has most certainly done it again.  I have loved all of their movies, and this one is no exception.  The story is sharp with endearing characters and plenty of one-liners that catch you when you aren't looking.  Computer animation has never looked better.  The ocean shots are simply jaw dropping stunning.  They've certainly come along way since their first shorts.<br />As you'd expect from a Pixar movie, this DVD set is wonderful as well.  Both full frame and widescreen versions are present, this time on different discs.  With a direct digital-to-digital transfer, it looks simply wonderful.  Sound is great as well in full surround.  The widescreen disc features plenty of behind the scenes information, including a commentary that incorporates deleted scenes and other information.  These added parts can also be viewed separately.  Disc two, the full frame disc, features things for kids to explore, like an encyclopedia on the ocean.  It also features a tour of Pixar's studios, fun character interviews, and the publicity for the movie.<br />You can't go wrong with a Pixar movie, and this is no exception.  If you happened to have missed it so far, find it today and enjoy.
630587493X|3.0|If I could get back the two hours I wasted on \\"Bicentennial Man\\" I would be a better man. I say this as a huge Robin Williams fan (RIP). What sounded like a  good Robin Williams movie is a bad piece of film work. He acts like a man in a robot suit, even when he finally wears clothes.<br /><br />Starring Robin Williams as Andrew the Android, I expected the movie to have the dramatic excellence he showed in \\"Awakenings\\" and \\"Good Will Hunting.\\" It isn't there. His acting is canned, reeking of predictability. Known for his comedic strength and range of vocalizations, his personality shows up mechanical. The casting director might as well have chosen Anson \\"Potsie Webber\\" Williams instead of Robin. The strengths of Williams just aren't utilized here.<br /><br />The plot of the robot becoming human is old in SF circles. Isaac Asimov gave the screenwriter the same story as seen in many \\"Outer Limits\\" and \\"Twilight Zone\\" episodes, minus the succinct, intelligent writing that defined both shows. It draws out too long, and tries to carry too many transitions that should have been left in the original novel, \\"The Positronic Man.\\"<br /><br />One scenes which caused me to cringe was Andrew's preaching to the World Council about what makes a man. John Merrick said it more powerfully in one sentence, \\"I am a man, not an animal\\" in \\"The Elephant Man.\\" Instead, we get a soliloquy by Andrew.<br /><br />Overloaded with morality messages, \\"Bicentennial Man\\" tries to tell us that people are different, that not all marriages need be procreative, that laws should be passed to validate the humanity of some people, that big corporations are bad, that artificial implants make for artificial people, and that euthanasia is no big deal. There are a few more statements beyond that had me shaking my head.<br /><br />The ideological cliches presented are akin to \\"My Favorite Martian,\\" with a dash of the Robot in \\"Lost in Space,\\" and some portion of \\"Terminator.\\"<br /><br />The basic theme that humanity is not what we are but who we are is so oversold. By the time the credits came, I felt as if I had an Ayn Rand novel crammed down my throat. Asimov was no Orwell, and his books do not have the depth of thought or layers of intellectual insight about the human condition. Screenwriter Nicholas Kazan did not help the movie as he leaves it coming across like an unedited script.<br /><br />Williams bombs in this one. An interesting idea from an intriguing short story doesn't work in film, at least not this time.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />TreeFortBooks.commanity is not what we are but who we are is so oversold.

B000099T2L|4.0|Beyonce is no tripple threat (I'm sorry but shaking ones butt does not constitute dancing and I've seen better actreses on Jerry Springer) but the girl definitely has vocals.  I think that Beyonce could have done waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay better.  \\"Naughty Boy\\" I liked \\"Baby Boy\\" I liked  there were maybe 3 or 4 other songs that were cool.  But there were like three others that were just weird (Sagitarius (sp) what the he--?)  Also, remakes ususally are different from the original.  The \\"Dangerously in Love\\" on this CD was the exact same song from that on the Destiny's Child CD.  I was also disappointed that \\"Summer Time\\" wasn't on this CD.  I really wanted to give this CD 3 1/2 stars but it's not an option.
0385504209|5.0|After reading this book, I think I can offer an opinion of the book itself with tainting it with religious dogma. This is a great book. The fact that it's at the top of the best seller lists restores my faith in the American reader.<br />This book will without a doubt eventually be turned into an incredible film. I can see a film very similar in pacing and character to Grisham's THE FIRM.<br />  As to the religious zealots that cannot even address the topics this book without injecting their dogma, I am reminded of how blind they are to the original meaning of the word faith.  People with such strong religious beliefs should invite discussion and opposing views. One thing this book has certainly done is INCREASE the discussions of God and religion -- and that should be seen as positive by peoples of all faiths.<br />  To react with anger and fright to this book shows a probable pre-existing crisis in faith in these reviewers and I can only hope that Dan Brown will follow this with an even bolder novel to shake these people thoroughly into fits of self-righteous delirium.
B00006CXXU|4.0|Let me start off by saying I've never really been a Christina Aguilera fan (she's kind of skanky).  But I do like her &quot;I could care less what everyone else thinks about me&quot; attitude.  That takes alot of personal growth.  But anyway, I'm stuck on &quot;Infatuated&quot; and &quot;A Voice Within&quot;.  And of course I'm still jammin' on &quot;Fighter&quot;, &quot;Dirty&quot; and &quot;Can't Hold Us Down&quot;.  For all the Christina haters, even you have to admit yah, she's always showin' her arss but the girl can sing.  Most of these other pop &quot;singers&quot; are ONLY &quot;arss shakers&quot;.  I gave the CD four stars rather than five because I would have preferred less slow songs and fewer interludes.
0385504209|1.0|The writing is bad.  The characters are one-dimensional stick figures.  The plot is unbelievable.  I had to force myself to finish the book.  I am not sure what Mr. Brown is trying to accomplish here.  There are many interesting references to Christian and pagan myth, but these are not seamlessly woven into the story, rather they are delived as little lectures that jerk us out of the story.  Given the extremely interesting buidling blocks of Jesus Christ, Mary Magdalene, the Holy Grail and Opus Dei, this could have perhaps been a great book in the hands of a good writer.  As it is, I wish I hadn't bothered.  In fact, I am irritated that I wasted money and time on such an amateur effort.
B000066NW0|3.0|This album is decent, but she is young and she is learning.  I feel that this is just the beginning of her career.  Her lyrics are very good especially the song &quot;naked&quot;.  But there is no way that she is punk at all anyone who says she is, does not know true punk.  The album is good and she is young so just wait for when shes older, it will be so much better.
0385504209|4.0|This wasn't the best book I've ever read, but being a college student and having facts and figures stuffed into my head day in and day out, an easy read was definitely welcome. I agree that the character development and dialogue are sub-par, but the book was hard to put down and fascinating, regardless of how accurate it is. However, I never got the impression that the author was trying to prove any of the theories in his book to be fact. Did it ever occur to any of the &quot;art historians&quot; or Dr. So and So's that the point of Mr. Brown's research may have been strictly to accurately portray an existing theory, not necessarily prove said theory? That perhaps Mr. Brown simply found the Holy Grail theory interesting and thought it would make for a good story? Lighten up! He wasn't writing an anthropology book, it's FICTION, and fiction involves unrealistic situations and half truths. If people can't figure that out, that's their problem, not the author's. If people are losing their faith over this book, then obviously their faith was not that strong to begin with. I fail to see how this book is a bash on Christianity. The idea that the Catholic Church as an institution has been wrong and made mistakes in the past is no secret (placing Galileo under house arrest for promoting a slightly more accurate model of the universe, for example). The idea of Jesus being married isn't that much of a stretch, since 30 y/o single men were a rare phenomenon in Jewish society during Jesus' lifetime. The author is not stating that Christianity should be destroyed. While the Grail theory presented in the book would certainly create upheaval in real life, in the novel the Priory decides not to release any information to the public. If Dan Brown truly hated Christianity or the Catholic Church, you would have seen its downfall in the book.<br />To sum up my rant, this is a shallow, easy but fun read, not to be taken literally (or seriously) because it's FICTION. Enjoy it for what it is.is.
0812550757|3.0|Ok I dont read a huge amount of books so for anyone that just casually reads like me then maybe my review will be more relevent to you. Ok im a pretty huge fantasy setting kind of guy Lord of the rings,Terry Pratchett, that sort of thing. But im actually a closet trekker from the 80's and a huge star wars fan so science fiction is an interest of mine but not so much in the book format. When i read Ender's Game i was  totally converted into it and Orson Scott Card was a new god to me. Enders game is truly one of if not the best stories i have ever had the pleasure of experiencing. Because you dont read it you experience it. I read the book in three days and for a person who takes maybe a good month and reads a little here and there its an amazing thing. So i finished it and read Ender's Shadow which takes place at the same time as Enders game. And is also a book to be experienced. Then I read Speaker for the dead. It confused me because it was almost written by a different person. It takes place almost 20 years after the very end of Enders game. Ender is almost forty and only a few times in the book actullay makes reference too the one before it. It doesent give as much info on what has happened since either. We are not told what has happened to anybody else he has met with the exception of Valentine who is only in the story for a couple of chapters. Card rambles about the catholic religion and the language of Portugal for long spaces of paper. Now for the good stuff because there is alot. Ender is still cool. Hes cool and in control of most situations like in Enders game. The new aliens are so bizarre in how they reproduce and their very morals. They truly are alien aliens. Unlike in movies where its just a few pieces of rubber on their face. This book makes you think about morals and how we treat others who are different as well. The  mystery will most likely  make you want too flip straight too the end too find out about it. But this isnt a sequel too Enders Gameso dont let it fool you. This book is the beginings of hard science fiction and religion. It is not the pick up whenever for some light reading. Its more accurate too say that Enders Game is the prologue and this is the begining of the real fact's story. The End of this book finally gets exciting as the mysteries of the story finally come bobbinh too the surface. But for most readers its alot too ask too wait that long for the story too progress. I am going too read the next one if for no other reason than too see what happens. But by no means is this book very similar too Enders Game. It is not an adventure in the traditional sense.
B0000046ZJ|5.0|The Oscar Peterson Trio did a number of these releases featuring artists of the day. Stan Getz is another one who, with the help of the OPT, shines.  Check out the OPT with Louis Armstrong... excellent craftmanship, and so is Stan Getz.  The OPT set a standard for this type of collaboration.  The sound quality is good, during periods of quiet some hiss is evident, this is probably caused by the tape quality and lack of effective filters for this white noise back when these recordings were put down on acetate.  As always with OPT...Very enjoyable.
B00005JM02|5.0|Absolutely loved this movie.  Unfortunately, my 2 year old also loves it and we watch it about twice a day.  After 50 times seeing this movie, I'm surprised I'm not sick of it, but I could easily be persuaded to watch something else.  But beware...it starts to come back to your in your sleep, not to mention the ability to recite each scene.  One recommendation, BIG Screen TV.  Wasn't until I watched it on a Big Screen did I notice the little things that I never saw before in the back ground, such as fish swimming, little crabs and so on.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I had to watch \\"Lost In Translation\\" on a Saturday morning in order to get through it (I fell asleep 2x at night). Don't watch this movie if you're even the slightest bit tired - it WILL put you to sleep. I kept waiting for something important, something relevant, or something even the slightest bit exciting to happen... and it never did. All the Oscar hype was pure insanity. Being a big Bill Murray fan, I HAD to see this movie. Murray has some classic movies on his resume - \\"Ground Hog Day\\", \\"What About Bob?\\", \\"Caddyshack\\", \\"Rushmore\\", etc... but by no means is this one of his best. I do not stand alone on Amazon (as of 10/18/07, there are 570 \\"1\\" star reviews). Bill Murray plays Bob Harris. Scarlette Johansson plays Charlotte. The movie focuses on these two sad lonely individuals on the other side of the world... in this case at the Park Hyatte Hotel in Tokyo. Bob Harris is making TV commercials for Suntory Whiskey. Charlotte had nothing else to do, so she followed her young photographer husband on a photo shoot. Giovanni Ribisi (as husband John) has a small role in the beginning and then he just disappears (what happened to him?). This movie is strictly about the dialogue between lonely Bob & Charlotte. There are some great shots of the city of Tokyo, a funny scene in a karaoke bar, and lots of boring talk and people staring out of windows. Other reviewers have said that \\"Lost In Translation\\" is heavy on atmosphere, light and mood. I'll give props to the guy holding the camera and the guy turning the lights on, but for me to sit and watch a movie... it has to be at least semi-interesting. After reading and hearing so much hype about this movie, it was such a huge let down. This movie was an utter waste of time. Borrrrring!
B0000VAFO0|3.0|A film that could have been better at least from the premise. It chooses to rewrite the mythos behind two age-old mythological icons and does so only to fit the fickle needs of the script. <br />Kudos have to be given to the art direction which they nailed dead on, if you pardon the pun. Not too much detail is given to some great thematic plot points (such as the Elder in the train car) which are quickly abandoned for slicker action scenes which feel obligatory at best.<br />A film that feels horribly empty, despite what seems like all good intentions on the part of the director. Horror buffs who watch this film like myself, can cry over how great the film could have been, given that there is so much potential behind the material.
B000056VPD|5.0|This dvd is simply awesome. I wasn't really interested in the big band stuff on the dvd.  But Benson's performances with Joe Sample are great. If you are a Benson fan, this DVD is a must for your collection.
B00007BKVC|5.0|A film by Ridley Scott<br />One thing that I have never understood is that \\"Thelma and Louise\\" has been marked as this huge feminist movie (which happens to be directed by a man) that is taking aim at men and shows them all as pigs.  I don't get it.  On one hand this is a comedy (a lot of things are funny in this movie).  On another hand, \\"Thelma and Louise\\" is a western that has a car instead of a horse, and two women rather than two men.  It is a buddy movie, and a road movie.  Most importantly, this film is a tragedy (with all that a tragedy entails).  I don't want to spoil the ending for anyone who has not yet seen the movie, but considering the journey that these women go on and how it concludes, I don't see how it can be viewed as this feminist male-bashing movie.<br />Thelma (Geena Davis) and Louise (Susan Sarandon) need a vacation away from their men.  Louise just needs some time away from Jimmy (Michael Madsen) and Thelma is in a fairly miserable marriage where she is emotionally abused by her husband Darryl (Christopher McDonald).  Thelma leaves without telling Darryl, which she believes will get her in trouble when she comes back.  Thelma and Louise are off to a cabin owned by Louise's boss and they are going to have some fun (and for Thelma, this is a change).  On the way to the cabin they stop at a roadside bar to have a couple of drinks and dance.  Thelma dances with a guy who seems to be very sweet, but when she gets drunk he helps her outside and tries to rape her.  Louise comes out in time to stop the rape, but ends up shooting and killing the man.  Rather than go to the police, they go on the run not thinking that the police would believe their version of what happened (many witnesses would have seen Thelma and Harlan dancing cheek to cheek).<br />This begins what is really the heart of the movie: the women on the run.  Some have said that having the two women end up on such a crime spree (from the murder to armed robbery) is glorifying the crimes and celebrating the women, but I disagree.  We have to look at why Thelma and Louise did what they did and what happens to them because of those actions.  There is no celebration here.  Yes, there is release and a sense of freedom for the two women, but there is also resignation.  They did their best to get out of a bad situation but they were never able to get their lives back on track and while Thelma is finally having \\"fun\\", she also says late in the movie that \\"something snapped inside me and I can never go back\\".  This is tragedy.<br />Men do not come off as poorly in this movie as some critics have said.  Yes, Harlan the rapist is a horrible man, and he got his just reward.  Thelma is married to a real dirt bag of a man.  J.D. (Brad Pitt) is a mixed character.  He is smooth and charming, but ends up being a thief.  Yet, he is still a likeable and mostly sympathetic character.  To move to the other end of the spectrum, Louise's boyfriend Jimmy is an entirely positive male character.  So is Hal (Harvey Keitel), the FBI agent who is trying to bring Thelma and Louise in alive and as easily as possible.  He is trying to protect these women as well as apprehend them, but even Hal can see things spiraling out of control.<br />\\"Thelma and Louise\\" is a very good movie made by a talented cast of people.  Geena Davis (The Accidental Tourist) and Susan Sarandon (Dead Man Walking) are both Oscar winners, and Ridley Scott is a three time nominee for Best Director (Thelma and Louise, Gladiator, Black Hawk Down).  Callie Khouri's screenplay did win the Oscar for this movie, and both Davis and Sarandon were nominated for Best Actress in this film.  There is a strong Oscar pedigree here and it shows in the movie.  It is a well told story of two women who in their attempt to break free from their lives end up going too far and become fugitives.  While there may be a celebratory feel to this movie, I believe that would be a misinterpretation of \\"Thelma and Louise\\".  It is an often comedic tragedy and simply is an excellent movie from start to finish.an often comedic tragedy and simply is an excellent movie from start to finish.
B000002GXX|5.0|Most people who were drawn to &quot;Hotel California's&quot; crossover charm, had trouble embracing the &quot;country-rock&quot; Eagles. &quot;Hotel's&quot; fans had written off the notion that there was an Eagles prior to '76. This, of course, was their loss since that assumption was not entrely true. With 1974's &quot;On the Border&quot;, the Eagles were dabbling in country but also moving into the mainstream by adding the rock ingredient. <br />By this point, Eagles were fully indulged in their &quot;successful mainstream&quot; direction, but didn't realize it until expanding their lyrical palette. &quot;One of These Nights&quot; however, is a cultist masterpiece in it's own right. A dark journey from beginning to finish which is accomodated by the dreary-beautiful artwork on it's cover. Most of the songs are long and evocative, often refering to relationships on the edge (take it to the limit) or the desire for obtaining them (one of these nights). Though not as fancy as &quot;Hotel&quot;, &quot;Nights&quot; has a generalized feel of continuity. <br />The things that differs the Eagles from the typical band is that they can sometimes tell stories to entertain us, rather than lag on the sad, drug-induced which plagued so many other 70's bands. Far superior to &quot;The Long Run&quot;, &quot;Nights&quot; is a necessity for the post-country / adult contemporary Eagles fan.
B000002NHN|5.0|The Book of Secrets was the first Loreena McKennitt CD I ever purchased, and it remains my favorite of those I own. Her music combines elements of Celtic folk tradition with other cultural influences (Middle Eastern, etc.) as well as her own original innovations. McKennitt is also blessed with one of the most beautiful, rich singing voices I have ever heard. Her vocals vary from haunting to lulling, and she can convey an amazing depth of emotion. It is plain that the songs are all very meaningful to her, which makes them even more wonderful to listen to. She truly pours her heart and soul into her music.<br />The songs themselves are both touching an inspirational. The CD insert gives some information on the background for the pieces (lyrics are also included), but this album has heightened my interest in learning more of the historical context. The songs are arranged nicely, mellow tracks alternating with more lively ones. 'Prologue,' 'Skellig,' 'La Serenissima' (instrumental) and 'Dante's Prayer' are very smooth and soothing, while 'The Mummer's Dance,' 'Marco Polo' and 'Night Ride Across the Caucasus' are more up-beat and energetic.<br />My favorite track is 'The Highwayman,' based on a poem by Alfred Noyes (it is also the longest track on the CD, clocking in at 10:16 minutes). It is the tragic story of the romance between a highwayman (outlaw) and the daughter of an inn-keeper. Bess, 'the landlord's black-eyed daughter,' is expecting a rendezvous with her sweetheart. But when the King's troops show up at the inn and take her hostage, she knows she must find a way to warn her lover to turn back, that it is not safe. They have tied her with 'a musket beneath her breast,' and her only hope for the highwayman is to warn him with a gunshot - one that will kill her. Thus the highwayman escapes, but when he learns that Bess is dead, he rides back in a fury to avenge her, only to be shot down and killed himself. The story is incredibly sad and poignant, and McKennitt's haunting tones send tingles up my spine. I also recommend looking up the original poem, as a few verses have been left out of the song.<br />This is an beautiful album, and is among my favorites out of my entire collection. I listen to it all the time, and the songs linger in my head long after. Whether you are already a Loreena McKennitt fan, or simply enjoy Celtic / folk type music and are looking for something new (though you may have heard 'The Mummer's Dance' on the radio - it was rather widely played for a while), 'The Book of Secrets' is a sure winner. It is also a great gift idea. I recommend it most highly.haunting tones send tingles up my spine.

B0000033IS|5.0|Like `nevermind' below, I too worry about my command of English in assigning this album its propers. Released March 10, 1967 (as Atlantic LP No. 8139), less than three months before the Beatles magnum opus, \\"I Never Loved A Man The Way I Love You,\\" is the equivalent in the soul music realm as \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" is in rock and roll. It's as simple as that.  Hard to believe now, isn't it, that \\"Respect\\" waited in the album for single release (as Atlantic 2403) until April 16th?!<br />I confess that as a 13-year-old in 1967,  I somehow missed the chart run of the title song, which came first. But \\"Respect\\" was simply a song NO ONE could ignore or dislike. It crossed all cultural, racial, gender and age barriers as a song urging one to confident self-assertion, and still does.  The company's honchos must have been thrilled that early summer of 67 when \\"Respect,\\" along with the Young Rascals \\"Groovin',\\" kept Atlantic releases owning the top of the pop chart for six consecutive weeks.<br />A startlingly brilliant artist had arrived and minted me as one more fan that spring as the trees blossomed. Aretha is going to be 62 this year and I'll be 50, but she can still count on my money. This is the album that started it all, and if it's possible that you have no Franklin material in your collection, this is the place you MUST start.
B00000D9TK|5.0|Celine Dion has reached new heights with her voice, with her passion in the recordings of this CD.  Her intonation is so dolce, yet so powerful, so believable, so true.  I speak french as a second language, et listening to her lyrics brings the wonderful language to life.  Each song is a unique journey through life, through love.
B00005B4GU|4.0|This is one of those albums that you can't help but analyze and scrutinize. With such undeniably beautiful tracks as Pyramid Song and You And Whose Army, this album covers the bases for people who love to close their eyes and dream a little dream. Then there are the more complex and layered arrangements, namely Life In A Glass House. It's got the OMG PHAT BEATZ for those who fell in love with Radiohead's electronic side, seen mainly in the sister album Kid A. And it's even got a *gasp* guitar-driven rock song. <br />With such a diverse helping of sound, it's easy to be a little overwhelmed, and you usually start picking your favorite tracks very quickly. This isn't an album that will appeal to everyone (at least, the entire album...certain songs will appeal to certain people). It doesn't need to be an unrivaled, thorough masterpiece from start to finish. It's almost impossible to be, what with the amount of ground Radiohead is trying to cover in this release.<br />A track by track, extremely opinionated review might help, so we start with Packt Like Sardines In A Crushd Tin Box, the mellow kick-off (if that makes sense). The kettle drums are infectious, and the synth immediately pops in just as it starts to get boring. Even the vocal structure evolves, with the (at first) off-putting vocal feedback in the background, flowing in and out as its own entity. This song seems to know exactly where it's going, and what to bring along for the ride. An album highlight.<br />Pyramid Song...wow. Music to swoon to. This song makes you almost forget where you are, and what you're doing. Off-beat rythyms, catchy piano and out-of-this-world voice, it's a song that you'll come back to time and time again.<br />Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors is the song that everybody seems to link to IDM frontrunners Autechre and Aphex Twin. Granted, it does hold a resemblence, but it has an extremely Radiohead feel to it, even with Thom's voice completely distorted beyond all measure (it's a wonder people can understand what he's saying in this track). Regardless, a great song, but only in every other listen.<br />You And Whose Army is the quasi-melodic masterpiece of eggbox production. Not only is Thom's voice distorted, so is the rest of the band, to the point where it sounds distant and quiet. Brooding and gentle, this piece flows from relaxed, to, well, RELAX. Towards the end of the song, everyone belts it out, and you're in the middle of a sonic smorgasbord.<br />I Might Be Wrong is, in my opinion, the culmination of the rock meets electronica vibe Radiohead touts. Not to say it's their best song (it's not, but damn good), it just seems to encompass everything they play. It's got a short interlude towards the end, which leads into a more fleshed-out bridge/ending. A nifty little piece that I always come back to.<br />Knives Out...the most straightforward rocker in the roster. It's beautiful, yes, but I always find myself wanting to skip the second half. It's not that the second half is bad, it's exactly the same. That might be the problem. This song is beautiful at first, but just seems to drone on and on.<br />Morning Bell/Amnesiac. Ugh, I commend anyone who can listen to the beginning of this song and not cringe. I can't help it, I think this song is just plain ugly. I suppose it carries the theme of the lyrics better than the Kid A version, but the Kid A version is just so much more flowing and melodic...definitely not a keeper.<br />Dollars &amp; Cents is the anti-capitolist rant that everyone touts as being &quot;masterfully produced&quot;. I don't care how it was produced, I don't think this song is good. It's fueled by a bassline that meanders in the mediocre, it's musically sparse yet contains a lot of feedback or white noise or something. Honestly I find it a chore to listen to this track, not a pleasure.<br />Hunting Bears is the Amnesiac instrumental. I guess I'm in the minority, but I always liked Treefingers and Hunting Bears. They have a greatquality that you can't find in the more prominent arrangements, a kind of minimalistic beauty. I love it.<br />Like Spinning Plates is easily my favorite of the latter half of the album. It's enigmatic, at times melodic, at other times menacing. The lyrics seem to work when played regularly, and when you play the song backwards (somehow find a means of playing this song backwards, it's very interesting). A feast for the ears.<br />Life In A Glass House also seems to suffer from the same fate as Knives Out. It's a great, beautiful piece that just should have ended sooner. The lyrics are poignant enough to warrant repeated listenings, and the mournful brass section manages to capture an odd beauty never before or again displayed in a Radiohead song.<br />Overall, the CD is good, but not great. I bought Kid A and Amnesiac at the same time, and Kid A blows Amnesiac out of the water. While Amnesiac has some great songs (the first half is simply stunning), Kid A seems to be good throughout, and more epic than Amnesiac. Even when purchased at the same time, Amnesiac suffers from little brother syndrome.<br />That being said, go out and buy it. Radiohead always manages to keep music interesting, and this album is no exception.
0671027344|5.0|This haunting novel is about the dilemma of passivity and growing up. The protagonist, Charlie, is entering a new world. He's entering high school for the first time and he learns about who he is to the rest of the world. Charlie is a wallflower. He's different from everyone else and he shares his feelings and thoughts to us through letters. This book is more intimate than a diary, though we don't know where Charlie lives, or who he's writing to. Charlie goes through uncharted territory, living his life and running from it all at the same time. It's a great coming-of-age story. It shows the hardships and trials of growing up in life, and competing to fit in. This novel demonstrates what it's like to grow up through a teenager's mind. Along with THE LOSERS' CLUB by Richard Perez, this is one of the best books I've read in ages.
B00005JMEW|2.0|Apart from the great cinematography, superb soundtrack, and thoroughly entertaining, beautifully romanticisized violence, this movie is just a B movie with a finely polished veneer. To say that the plot is lacking would be rather kind. Not only is it lacking, I have seen hundreds of martial arts/animes that have the same premise, and this movie didn't really stick out to me. Sure there are lots of dialogues and colorful characters that Terantino fans will love, but it just isn't a great movie. Entertaining as hell, but not a great movie. I hate to say it, but Terantino's best movie is, and always will be, Pulp Fiction. I wish it wasn't so, he is so damn likeable and stylish, but it's the sad truth.
0156027321|5.0|This adventurous tale has a theme of bringing together things that don't seem to belong with each other - from Pi's combined faith in the teachings of Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam to his survival at sea trapped in a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger. The author takes these seemingly contradictory things and fits them together so that they become not only sensible, but necessary.<br />Even though you know from the beginning that Pi eventually escapes the waters of the Pacific, I was nevertheless drawn forward wondering exactly how.<br />When the tale finally reaches its end, the dramatic metaphorical twist in plot really does live up to the claim that it will make you believe in God (or strengthen your belief).  Instead of asking &quot;Is there a God?,&quot; Pi instead asks &quot;Is life worth living if there isn't?&quot;  The answer to the first question then becomes plain for both the character and the reader.<br />&quot;Life of Pi&quot; is thoroughly engrossing - its every aspect a fascinating piece of storytelling.  It has secured a place among the best books I've read.

0345404475|5.0|The title of this novel clearly demonstrates that this book is going to deal with some man-machine sociological technological &quot;issues&quot;. That it does. <br />When reading a biography on the author, I found out that he only made something like $9,000 on the book (which is disappointing), yet it was a sci-fi hit in the theater, grossing millions.<br />Five Stars.
B00008J4P5|4.0|To say that I did not like &quot;White Blood Cells&quot; would be an understatement. Yes, there were a couple of songs that I liked, including of course &quot;Fell in Love With a Girl&quot;, but overall I thought that album was a bunch of noise without much melody or warmth.<br />Switch to &quot;Elephant&quot;. Of course I had heard the single &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot;, which I liked. For Christmas my 14 yr. old daughter had &quot;Elephant&quot; on her wish-list, so I got it for her. And of course I listened to it as well. Much to my surprise, I liked what I was hearing! Over the last couple of months, I have to come to actually like this album, a lot.<br />&quot;Elephant&quot; (14 tracks, 50 min.) still is touch-and-go for me, but there are more than enough highlights. &quot;Black Math&quot; is my favorite track, period, it just rocks beyond belief. &quot;In the Cold Cold Night&quot; finds Meg on vocals, and quite effectively. The monster track is &quot;Ball and Biscuit&quot;, an epic song that finds Jack whipping out heavy guitar solos, just great. Other highlights include &quot;Little Alcorns&quot; and the short (less than 2 min.) &quot;Hypnotize&quot;, a surf-rocker as good as you'll find. Meg's drumming, a hot topic, is quite good throughout the album.<br />So almost a year after this album came out, I finally &quot;get it&quot;. &quot;Elephant&quot; in my opinion is a quantum leap from &quot;White Blood Cells&quot; as it shows the 2 person band actually sounding as a full band, with songs that have melodies. Can't wait what the next White Stripes album will bring.
020530902X|5.0|This book has it all. It is clear, it is short, it is easy to read, it has examples. No one that takes English seriously and has to do some, however little, writing in their job can afford to be without it.<br />However, within its perfection also lies its weakness. I say that as a reference, or as a tool for a &quot;false beginner&quot; of grammar and writing it is sufficient. If you, on the other hand, tries to start from scratch, it might not deliver. For the absolute beginner I woul recommend this book together with any of Warriner's &quot;English Grammar and Composition&quot; books.
B00009Z574|4.0|When Yes issued \\"Tormato\\" in 1978, it was not received well by critics or Yes fans alike, and over the years this has become one of the \\"lost\\" albums of Yes. This definitive reissue is most welcome, not only for sound quality, but it offers a new opportunity to re-assess \\"Tormato\\", which is actually not nearly as \\"bad\\" as many want you to believe.<br />The \\"Expanded & Remastered\\" version of \\"Tormato\\" (18 tracks, 79 min.) brings of course the 8 tracks of the original album, which brings a rockier and tighter sound than we are used to from Yes, spurred by the succes of the \\"Wonderous Stories\\" single of the previous \\"Going for the One\\" album. No 10 or 15 min. epic songs here. Highlights include \\"Future Times/Rejoice\\", the hard rocking \\"Release Release\\" (a minor hit), the brooding yet optimistic \\"Arriving UFO\\" (remember, this is the age of \\"Close Encouters of the Third Kind\\") containing some great Rick  Wakeman keys, and \\"On the Silent Wings of Freedom\\", which finds Chris Squire working overtime on bass, as only he can. There is also the hit single \\"Don't Kill the Whale\\", still a concert staple these days.<br />The reissue comes with a whopping 10 bonus tracks, which of course is a mixed bag. Highlights include \\"Abilene\\" (the B side of the \\"Dont Kill the Whale\\" single), \\"Days\\", Jon Anderson singing a capella, just beautiful, \\"Countryside\\", and \\"Everybody's Song\\", a demo of what would become \\"Does It Really Happen\\" on the \\"Drama\\" album.<br />The folks at Rhino did a magnificant job again in this reissue, with great liner notes. \\"Tormato\\" is a fine album, if you can get away from the notion that Yes in 1978 was more than creating 10 min. epic songs. I have a soft spot for \\"Tormato\\" in the Yes catalogue, and this is the definitive release of it.<br />PS The title of the album is a reference to \\"Yes Tor\\", a hill in the England country side near Okehampton, Devon. The album cover is deservedly much maligned, as it has nothing to do with \\"tomatoes\\", shame on Hipgnosis which dreamt up the album concept. What were they thinking?reamt up the album concept. What were they thinking?

B000024D4R|5.0|Perhaps Pink Floyd's heaviest album, Animals is a scathingly sarcastic commentary on human beings as classified through animals. The three types are Dogs (the money hungry businessmen), pigs (the hypocritical bureaucrats), and sheep (the mindless followers). As usual Roger's lyrics are top-notch, as is Gilmour's guitar work.<br />The album begins and ends with the two parts of Pigs On The Wing, which are essentially the same, basic acoustic song. It's amazing how such a heavy album begins and ends so simply; the album almost feels like a storm that way. <br />Track number two is the seventeen-minute long masterpiece Dogs, which is easily the best track on the whole album. The song goes through quite a few changes from a fast-paced guitar intro, to a slow middle portion with the keyboards.  Dogs is quite an eclectic song but everything just flows so perfectly.<br />Pigs (Three Different Ones) is a very psychotic sounding song, and features some Floyd's more insane effects. The heaviest moment of the album is featured at the end of the song where Gilmour lets loose an incredibly intense guitar solo.<br />Sheep is a brilliantly composed song; especially impressive is when Roger Waters' voice segues into a synthesizer.  Once again, the song ends on a very heavy and intense note.<br />In the end, Pink Floyd's Animals feels like a great, meaty hot dog. You have the simplistic bun on the top and on the bottom and the meat in the middle is comprised of Dogs, Pigs and Sheep.

0385504209|1.0|I just read this book. I can say that it has really given me great pleasure...laughing out loud at the incredibly bad writing! What a bunch of overblown melodrama. Some of the dialogue is so bad, I couldn't decide if it was more like an episode of THE HIGHLANDER television show or some of Dr. Evil's lines in an AUSTIN POWERS movie.  Someone should start a Dan Brown/Da Vinci Code bad writing contest. As for the story itself, it is definitely a poor imitation of an Umberto Eco novel.  Brown has about half the erudition of Eco, and a quarter of the writing skill.
B000002JB8|3.0|Okay... I REALLY respect early Vangelis (through the early 80s), and his music is a large part of the reason I ever bought a synthesizer while I was in college (that college degree paid off... now I own quite a few synths!). But later as I got into creating music a lot myself, I realized the synth was just an instrument, and it was what Vangelis DID with it that made the music special.  To this day I would say that the Bladerunner soundtrack is one of the best marriages of soundtrack to video.  Stunning visually and aurally.  <br />BUT...Oceanic is a sedate sleeper that never wakes up.  Which is great if you just want to relax, but there's NOTHING on this disc that moves me, and that is so unlike &quot;Opera Sauvage&quot; or &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot;.  I've heard PLENTY of synthy music on par with Oceanic.  I've heard very little that grips me like the Bladerunner soundtrack (other than OTHER older Vangelis).<br />Check out MP3.com... you'll find plenty of home recording nuts putting out as good or better material than Oceanic.  But if relaxing, uninspiring (unless you want to be inspired to sleep) tunes is what you're seeking, then look no further.<br />Again, I'm not saying this is a bad CD, I'm just saying it's not a great CD...which is a real shame given who wrote and recorded it.  He must have had some car payments he had to make...
B000089QEN|4.0|Enter Rebecca \\"Becky\\" Sharp, our anti-heroine heroine: the woman whom our series & the novel surrounds, but whose actions & life are certainly not above reproach.  Becky is a scheming, conniving, untrustworthy little minx.  Also enter Amelia Sedley (Emmy to friends), a sweet and innocent young lady, trusts that her friend Becky is as honest and true as she herself is; but it is just not so.  Becky is envious of her friend Amelia's good fortune and privileges, and does everything she can to attain those things for herself.  She pursues love in the least likeliest places (going after men she could not possibly be interested in), hoping to eventually catapult herself into the upper crust of society; Becky manipulates man after man, using them for what they can give her, while Amelia Sedley, who is trusting and kind, sadly begins to experience misfortune at the hand of both fate and society.<br /><br />All in all, this six-part mini-series from A&E was a great watch, if you can get past a small bit of questionable content and mild language (mostly uses of d*mn, adult themes, cleavage, sensual situations, battle violence)...it give us modern viewers a peek into polite Regency society, mixes lower class and upper class, and ultimately proves that life is what you make of it & that actions have consequences, good or bad.<br /><br />I thought that A&E did a fine job of condensing the super-long Thackeray novel to a mini-series: I've read the book, and yes, there are some changes, but this is likely the most faithful version of \\"Vanity Fair\\" we will ever see.  It's very well-acted, and very well done: definitely recommended!
0385504209|1.0|It is a sad thing to realize that people read Dan Brown's \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and believe to be reading intellectual material. And the fact that this novel tops the bestseller list for over a year only proves that the average reader limits his/her choice to book with dubious quality. This is the same kind of readers that call Brown's moneymaker novel of high intellectual stuff.<br />To begin with \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is far to reach any level of being called an intellectual book. Plain and simple, this book is a very mediocre thriller written with no style whatsoever. As so it works for about 300 pages when its story becomes tedious and predictable. Moreover, nobody expects a writer who deals with such material to be a James Joyce or a Faulkner, but, nevertheless, there is no need of writing for dummies, like Brown insists on doing. Thoughts come in italic, and to make sure that his reader has understood it is a thought indeed, the writer pens after such sentence 'thought Robert' -- or whoever used his/her brain. To make matters worse, the vast majority of these thoughts aren't necessary. If Brown trusted enough in his reader's intelligence he would leave room for imagination and wouldn't state every single thought every character had.<br />The characters are so archetypical --and far from being human -- that they laughable. Not a single soul lives in this book. Moreover, the supposed 'mind games' are silly and for dummies. It is impossible to believe that someone could find pleasure in seeing Robert breaking a code. Da Vinci deserved more respect and not his (Da Vinci's) name and works in a material with such a low quality. By the way, using Da Vinci's name in the title and Mona Lisa's eyes in the cover of the book was a very smart move. The Renascence Genius has little to do with this book, but his masterpiece has even less. The famous painting is mentioned for about 3 or 4 pages in the beginning of the book and then forgotten. So, be aware, those who expect something on Mona Lisa's smile.<br />It is clear that Brown attempted to copycat Umberto Eco, and his most notorious fiction: \\"The Name of the Rose\\" and \\"Foucault's Pendulum\\". But he failed. Oh, boy this is good to tell how much he failed. While Eco is a genius with novels as deep and smart as extremely well written, Brown writes pseudo-intellectualism for the masses that have never read a really deep and labored book. But with \\"Da Vinci\\" the writer is reaching a part of the population who has never read something brainy. Mind you that his book is not intellectual stuff, but some people may find it so, due to their lack of background.<br />There are people with hot arguments on the theological implications on 'The Da Vinci Code'. Personally speaking, I believe that with his fantasies Brown may have managed to get closer to the truth than we have ever expected. But his prose is so plain, so silly that it is impossible to take his side. Nevertheless, I wouldn't take the other side either.<br />Readers who look for intellectual and well-written material should stick to the original one, i.e. Umberto Eco. Brown is for the masses indeed, for those who read a book for mere fun and not for the ideas. Writing --and reading-- this kind of prose is not a crime, but it is so to try to sell it disguised in insightful material.ing on Mona Lisa's smile.<br />It is clear that Brown attempted to copycat Umberto Eco, and his most notorious fiction: \\"The Name of the Rose\\" and \\"Foucault's Pendulum\\".

The BBC movie version was almost as great at the book and very very close to the accuracy of the book.  I have read Emma and Persuasion and loved them both, though not as well as Pride and Prejudice.  You'll want to buy it so that you have it to read again and again!
0385504209|5.0|This book is a wonderful, historical, fictional NOVEL.  If read with that in mind, it will fascinate you.  Should you choose books based on reviews, then beware that it has twisted the undies of conservative Catholics!  You who are looking to give it 1 star in the hopes I would be spared the mercy of reading such lies really do need to get a life!  At some points a reader may even question truth from fiction, but at the conclusion I seriously doubt that the Catholic Church is in any jeopardy of losing true believers. A well written mystery for anyone -religious and non-religious readers.  Enjoy!

0440238609|3.0|I picked up these books based on the recommendation of quite a few people on the net.  These books are quite well written and plotted.  That said I would like to place a warning with these books.  If it is your intention to teach your children Christian values and doctrine then you should ask them not to read these books until they are well grounded in the faith and truth, if at all.  Phillip Pullman has very intentionally crafted the books so that they are a direct attack at Christian faith and doctrine.  He has created a philosophy of naturalism mixed with a form of reincarnation and humanism.  <br />I anticipate that many may read this review and claim I am trying to stifle free speech or to keep children from hearing all sides of a matter.  That would be a shifting of the argument.  Pullman's world and philosophy is no more solid than the Spectre's he writes about.  He attempts to muddle truth with emotional arguments while ignoring the reality of the inspired Word of God, historical evidence of the persona and work of the sacrificial Jesus, and the possibility of the Creation.<br />Over they three books, good and evil are quite muddled.  By the end of the series, the church is very definitely evil, God has never existed, and the Authority who claims to be God is a sadistic dictator.  While employing no truth and evidence, he attempts to discredit the Church (not necessarily hard since humans are fallen beings and susceptible to sin) and the existence of God (more difficult because God demands faith based on the evidence in the Word and in Creation).
0446530891|4.0|All the book is excellent, it will keep you reading all the time and you will always want to know what will happen in the next page, but it has two big mistakes, the first one is that you know exactly what happened with the kidnap when the FBI make his investigations and deductions, you know what deductions are good and what aren't, the second mistake is the end of the book, Baldacci must thought another reason for the kidnapping.

B000001EL3|5.0|Destroyer was released in 1976 and was their followup to their breakthrough album Alive! which still stands as the best live hard rock album of all time. At this point, their previous studio releases were no-frills heavy rock albums. For this album, Kiss took it to the next level. Hiring Bob Ezrin to produce Destroyer was a masterstroke. Much like George Martin did with the Beatles, Ezrin brought a sophistication and diversity to the band that ultimately made them superstars. In addition, Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley were growing as songwriters, expanding their horizons while staying true to their roots.<br /><br />Every track here is exceptional and the band continue to play several of these tracks live. The album hits hard from the get go with the all-time classic \\"Detroit Rock City\\", one of their most memorable tracks. This is certainly one of their best performances ever with Gene Simmons' creative bass line and Ace Frehley and Paul Stanley's unison guitar solos. \\"Shout It Out Loud\\" is one of their great rock anthems, arguably their best next to \\"Rock And Roll All Nite.\\"  Other tracks such as \\"Sweet Pain\\", \\"Flaming Youth\\", and \\"King Of The Night Time World\\", while not as well known, are also outstanding tracks.<br /><br />The remainder of Destroyer shows a maturing in the band's songwriting as well as the creativity of producer Bob Ezrin. \\"God Of Thunder\\" with its slow heavy riff and its theatrical production, is one of their great tracks. \\"Great Expectations\\" is a great ballad that features strings and a choir singing the chorus at the song's outro. \\"Do You Love Me\\" is a great pop song from Stanley featuring church bells and backing female vocals at the end. Finally, Peter Criss' piano  ballad \\"Beth\\", which featured no bass, guitars, or drums, would be the band's biggest hit single. Although their debut album featured more classic tracks and Creatures Of The Night and Lick It Up were great metal albums, none of their albums would have the universal appeal of Destroyer. Like IV was to Led Zeppelin and Hotel California was to the Eagles, this is their definitive statement. If you've never been a Kiss fan, this is the album that will convert you.IV was to Led Zeppelin and Hotel California was to the Eagles, this is their definitive statement.

B00005B36H|5.0|As my title suggests, this album was highly important for me. It let me expand my mind to the countless number of artists that are continually creating original, interesting and simply enjoyable music. And Tool is no different. Don't be put off to see that Tool is a kind of \\"starting point\\" for me, it doesn't matter. All that matters is that you enjoy the album, and as subjective as this will be, you will.<br />I _really_ hate to sound like a fanboy, but this album is perfect. The Grudge starts off Lateralus, hard hitting and heavy. An intense drum track by Danny Carey astounded and moved me. Absolutely fantastic. Riveting and commanding guitar and base riffs from Adam Jones and Justin Chancellor creating a harsh image of the song. The vocals, in my opinion not Maynard's best, suit the song perfect. The song comes to a close with a twenty second scream, which is just as breathtaking as the drumming. Don't let this song put you off the rest of the album like it did to me when I first heard it; let it grow on you. It took me around ten listens to enjoy it. It's worth it.<br />The Patient is a superb display of intracate guitar riffs and passages, and shows that technical talent means nothing. I find it stupid that people dismiss Adam Jones' guitar work because he is supposedly technically not as sound as some other artists. The only thing that matter is how the sound he creates fits the purpose of the song, and how enjoyable it is. For me, no one does it better than Adam Jones. He showcases a spiral of beautiful riffs through-out the song, especially in the \\"solo\\" section. Again, Danny Carey's drumming is exceptional, and is highly creative.<br />Schism is probably the song most people have heard from Tool. And people say it's overrated, but I think that's rubbish. Justin Chancellor shows a beautiful and delicate bass line, which shows he is more than capable of filling Paul's shoes. Adam Jones follows up with an emotional, thought provoking, creative and intelligentguitar solo. I cannot put into words what I felt when I hear it. Maynard's vocals at the point where he sings, \\"Between supposed lovers,\\" moves me to tears at the beauty of it. Carey's persistant and strong drumming more than proves his genius.<br />Parabol and Parabola are next, and both showcase a \\"different\\" Tool, to me. Parabola seems to have a slightly metal-ish sound to it, with an inventive and creative chorus from Maynard, superb drumming and well fitting riffs. Next is Ticks and Leeches, which is in my opinon not as good as the other songs. The guitar riff is simplisitic and repeated, but it serves the purpose of the song. Danny Carey's drumming on the song is absolutely astounding. The pace of it is very very appropriate. Adam's solo is, like on Schism's, attractive and emotional. The song ends with fast, powerful drumming.<br />Lateralus is next, probably my favourite song. Starts off with a simple, but effective guitar riff from Adam Jones. Explodes into a beautiful rythm, and Maynard starts with intelligent lyrics and amplify his creativity. Suddenly it all comes to a stand still, and amazingly emotional vocals by Maynard makes you seem so vulnerable. ... It's that effective. As is the next part, when Adam Jones comes up with a riff that is engaging, and Justin Chancellor responds with something I cannot describe. You'll have to hear it to understand. Then Maynard finishes with, \\"With my feet upon the ground...\\" which is also highly effective and brings me to a stand still. This was the moment I would wait for many nights, to simply hear the beauty of. <br />Next are Disposition, Reflection and Triad. These songs in my opinion, are best off hearing together. Disposition is a good song to relax to, it sooths your body and mind. Reflection is very hypnotic, and has a mid-Eastern influence, which Danny Carey's drumming and Adam's riffs show. Mystery fits the song very well. Triad is an instrumental, and is like a bomb, waiting to explode. Awesome stuff.<br/>Overall, this album is _way_ too important to be overlooked. It's truely beautiful. I suggest you buy it, and listen to it at least twenty times before you dismiss it, it will grow on you. You will feel intense emotions you've never felt before, as I have. Tool are a very special band, and a band I will treasure.
B00005JKN9|5.0|SINCE THERE ARE SO MANY REVIEWS ON THIS MOVIE I WILL JUST SAY THIS: LISTEN TO ALL THE GOOD REVIEWS FROM THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT AND IGNORE ALL THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS FROM ALL OF THE STUPID PEOPLE!!
0385504209|1.0|I thought that this was one of the most stupid books I ever read.  The plot stunk.  The history so faulty it was laughable. The characters were boring, underdeveloped and tedious.  The riddles were the most ridiculous and predictable.  The conclusion....ho-hum.<br />Don't waste your time
B00005JLH3|4.0|A friend recommended this movie to me and after watching it 3 times I can see why we both love this film. I was mesmerised by the drumline scences- I live in Europe and we don't have black colleges and marching bands as a part of our culture but this movie crosses cultural boundaries. Good plot, nice romance without being to sugary only disapponted by the ending (not really) I didn't want it to end so I watched it all over again!
0385504209|5.0|Dan Brown is a great author. He has captivated me and will continue to do so. Reviews are trashing on the book stating that Mr. Brown is making things up and tearing up the Catholic belief, or Christians for that matter. It's a shame people are so close-minded to see the truth. Perhaps someday you will realize that Dan Brown was only trying to pry open that part of your brains to try to get you to remember the truth.<br />With that said, The da Vinci Code is a piece of art in it's self. It has opened new horizons for me. I have finished each of his books within 5 days total and I am anxiously waiting the next.<br />Read the book. No one is making you believe what you don't want to. The book is an awesome find, sure to keep your interest. If you fail to leave without the knowledge that was intended, oh well, at least you will leave it saying it was GOOOOOOOOD.
0385504209|3.0|I waited and waited for the greatness and finally for the great finish and I was disappointed.<br />Kind of formulaic, touching on concepts and objects that fascinate many to gain readers interest.
0385504209|3.0|Despite its reputation, Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code rates no more than a 3.  On the whole a captivating read, the book suffers from poor structure and historical inaccuracy.  Worst of all, the same ideas were captured in a much richer, intriguing, and complex book, Umberto Eco's &quot;Foucault's Pendulum.&quot;  Alas, Brown has re-hashed ideas that tantalize the uninformed but disappoint the more literate.<br />Instead of reading this Clif Notes version of Western Civilization, I suggest you read &quot;Pendulum&quot; or study Da Vinci himself. Then, judge for yourself if Christianity is sitting on a secret, or whether instead the secret is really inside ourselves.<br />Note: mainstream Christians, especially Catholics, may find &quot;Code&quot; offensive or even blasphemous.  Since I am Jewish, I lack the personal, cultural, and educational background to judge;  you should proceed with caution.

0312995423|3.0|This book was a let down after reading the Da Vinci code.  It was an average &quot;airplane book,&quot; and not a mind-blowing puzzle book like the Da Vinci Code.  I think that Digital Fortress is a bit predictable, and although I didn't really put it down, I was reading it on an airplane (with nothing else to read), and I just wanted to get through it so I could start something else.  If you loved the Da Vinci Code, I would recommend Digital Fortress, but if you only &quot;liked&quot; the Da Vinci Code, I would recommend skipping Digital Fortress.
B00008S2VG|1.0|Barely a week after this album was released, Kelly Clarkson's &quot;Thankful&quot; debueted, shooting to the No. 1 spot on Billboard's album charts &amp; kicked &quot;American Life&quot; into oblivion, never to be seen again.  If that doesn't tell you how much this album sucked, then I don't know what else will.  Of course, it didn't help that the video for Madonna's self-titled song had been banned for it's blatent left-wing, anti-war, anti-Bush images, and the album's explict language turned off most radio stations to it (Smart marketing? I don't think so.)  If you feel the urge to buy this album, I have three words for you: Just say ... NO!!  It's not worth the money.
B000001Y79|3.0|I am just doing this so AMAZON stop recommending this CD to me. I wish there is just a button that says I already own this but not interested in giving a review. Geez
0800105877|3.0|This video is an adaptation of the stage production that was produced in London's Roundhouse (a former train roundhouse converted into a theatre). The film makes use of the entire theatre, not just the stage. It makes for a very claustrophobic, but effective setting.<br />I have mixed feelings about this film. I am glad someone tried something different with Hamlet. I was glad to see a 30 year old Hamlet for a change. Hamlet is not the young undergrad college student we always picture him to be, but a 30 year old grad student. Shakespeare's play tells us that Yorick's skull has been in the ground for 24 years and Hamlet tells us how he knew Yorick as a childhood friend. Nicol Williamson (while not the common image of Hamlet)was a 30 year old actor playing a 30 year old character.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Every time I listen to this record, I love it more and more!!  I'm simply blown away at how good each and every song is!  My favorites are Me Against the Music, Boom Boom, Breathe on Me, Toxic, Touch of My Hand and Everytime.  There's so much variety on this album that suits any kind of musical taste and mood.  Every song has something different to offer and they get better with each listen.  Give this album a chance and I promise you won't regret it!
B00005JMEW|5.0|It's scandalous that Quentin Tarantino wasn't nominated for a Best Director award. This movie takes the sword and cuts it (buttocks) hard! \\"Kill Bill: Vol. 1\\" is a tribute to old kung fu, samurai and revenge flicks. People may argue that it's a huge ripoff, but it's totally fresh. The Bride (Uma Thurman) was a part of the DiVAS, a group of mercenaries, but quit for an unknown reason. Bill (David Carradine) was the leader and he ordered his gang to off the Bride. But, they didn't exactly do a good job and she ended up recovering from her coma. She traveled to Tokyo and summoned a retired Hattori Hanzo (Sonny Chiba) to construct the perfect samurai sword. Green Hornet music remembrance! Bruce Lee's yellow track suit is the bomb! Then in the House of Blue Leaves, she took care of everyone. A red rain had been poured all over the place! She even nailed the schoolgirl, literally! The ultimate showdown between O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) and the Bride was a work of literature! Gracefulness has never looked so good in combat! \\"Please Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\\" is one of the best songs in music history! Mammoth achievement by Quentin Tarantino. Even the cliffhanger ending made quiver in my seat! Wholly! You gotta see \\"Kill Bill: Volume 2\\" to get the full impact of this masterpiece!
B00009V8Z9|2.0|After I heard the theme song to One Tree Hill, I thought there might be something to Gavin Degraw and was stoked to check it out. Unfortunately (besides the song &quot;I don't want to be&quot;) its pretty much the same cookie cutter, crappy accoustic, John Mayer type, cheesy kind of &quot;rock&quot;. If you like hanging out at coffee shops and the mall then this will probably be right up your alley. If you like real rock music don't bother.
0380778556|5.0|I had to read this book my sophomore year of HS for English class.  I loved it!  And now it is part of my collection, along with its sequels.  Plot twists, humor, romance, suspicions, and a surprise ending all roled into one.  A young girl (never given a name) meets a sophisticated older widower named Max deWinter while on holiday.  They marry and return to his mansion, Manderley, where the girl lives in the shadow of Rebecca, his first wife.  Rebecca drowned in a sailing accident near Manderley...or did she?<br />Sit back and enjoy the great ride DuMaurier takes you on in this can't-put-it-down page turner.  You won't be disappointed!
B00009Z576|3.0|Outside of all the interesting facts that make \\"Drama\\" stand by itself in the Yes catalog (including the subraction of Jon Anderson/Rick Wakeman and the addition of Buggles Geoffrey Downes/Trovor Horn)Yes was in need of an overhaul, and \\"Drama\\" proved to be an energized change.  \\"Going For The One\\" and \\"Tormato\\" had some monumental moments mixed in with things that would have been outtakes on earlier albums.  They were a progressive rock band but they were not progressing as much as they had in the past and the staleness show.<br />  Although from listening to some of the fascinating bonus tracks included here from the &quot;Paris sessions&quot; it sounded like Yes (including Anderson/Wakeman) were looking to change their sound a bit, but the melodies were still a bit tired and world weary.  The sessions were scraped.<br /> \\"Drama\\" was still very much a Yes album but with one decided difference- it had a raw energy that had not appeared on a Yes album since \\"Relayer\\" (interestingly, that album had an outsider come in and shake things up as well).  I'm not saying that the song writing was more inspired than on \\"Going For The One\\" or \\"Tormato\\", but on \\"Drama\\" everyone sounds like they are excited to be playing the music and you feel it.  Steve Howe especially sounds rejuvenated by the changes and plays about as intensely as he did on \\"Relayer\\".<br />  For the most part there really aren't any duds on this album (although the first thirty seconds of \\"White Car\\" sound like the intro to a seminar on self improvement).  \\"Machine Messiah\\", \\"Does It Really Happen?\\" and \\"Tempus Fugit\\" are the standouts for me.  While \\"Into The Lens\\" seems to have an interesting mix of progressive rock and new wave.<br />  The sound of the re-mastering is immaculate, and bonus tracks prove interesting.  There are plenty of worthy Yes albums that I would recommend way before this one.  But if you are curious but nervous about later Yes albums due to their reputation I would go for this one because of its exciting energy and consistency.e because of its exciting energy and consistency.

B0000DD7LB|5.0|I find it appalling that pathetic losers who have never heard a note on this album are allowed to post such hateful reviews!!  If anybody took the time to listen to this album, they would realize that it's the best that pop music has to offer!!  People are judging this album like it's a classical composition by Beethoven, it's truly hilarious!  This album should be compared to music from its own genre, and in this respect it's truly fantastic!  Every song on the album is worth a listen and some are especially impressive, such as Breathe on Me, Toxic &amp; Touch of My Hand.  If you judge this album for the music, not for the name attached to it, I guarantee you'll enjoy it!
B000002J09|4.0|like many people growing up in the '90s i knew who led zeppelin was and at the same time i didnt. led zeppelin is america's rock band and the only song ive ever heard was stairway to heaven its the only song guitarists talk about when they start out. except for the name and the naked angel i didnt know a thing about them. until all my drummer friends wouldnt shut up about john bonham. so i decided to get the album to listen to everything. From what i can decipher led zeppelin is a very good ensemble band. what i mean by that is that a lot of bands now such as tool, dream theater are bands who masster the complexities of their instruments and led zeppelin was ahead of their times by doing that. anybody can plainly see that jimmy paige is a solo god and no one can match robert plant's screaming and john bonham is very impressive (black dog). and this album is the album which is the most mainstream they get. i think everything comes together in perfect harmony and they live up to their name
B00014NE62|5.0|This beautiful Merchant/Ivory film is now available on a two disc dvd set. Disc one presents the film itself in a stellar transfer. As with most M/I films, the cinematagraphy is breathtaking with many scenes filmed in the fall at King's College and Trinity College. The score by Richard Robbins is one of the most beautiful ever created for a film and it is outrageous that it was overlooked for an Oscar nomination. The acting is also superb with a pre-stardom Hugh Grant as the staunchly repressed Clive Durham, James Wilby as the title character, Rupert Graves as the hunky garden boy Scudder and Ben Kingsley in a humourous turn as Maurice's psychiatrist.<br />Disc Two contains a 30 minute documentary &quot;The Story of Maurice&quot; which features interviews with screenwriter Kit Hesketh-Harvey, directors James Ivory and Ishmail Merchant and actors Hugh Grant, James Wilby and Rupert Graves. Their conversations are very enlightening especially the actors recalling their research and motivation into their roles and the responses they received after the film opened (for some strange reason Japanese school girls were crazy about them!). &quot;Conversations with the Film Makers&quot; contains another 13 minutes of interviews. Thirty minutes of twelve deleted scenes and alternative scenes are included. This includes a different opening preface to the film and another character that ended up being cut from the film.<br />This beautiful dvd set (the art work alone is gorgeous) is worthy of any dvd library and a must for fans of the Merchant/Ivory films.
B00008J4P5|3.0|My review is a bit tainted, since I came into White Stripes midway through their career, and haven't been able to grow with them as a listener as they grew into their music. Elephant reverts a step from the more sophisticated &quot;White blood cells,&quot; which in all honesty I took for vintage Stones (before they needed a giant strobe light on tour to make them look like they were actually moving) and embarks on a more folksy bent. &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot; and &quot;Black Math&quot; are two songs that pop out at once, though, but the album gets far too cutesy towards the end - &quot;Little Acorns&quot; and &quot;It's true that we love one another.&quot;
B000ANVPPQ|5.0|Most of the one star reviews given to this movie are for the crappy, unauthorized DVD release from 2001. Amazon dumps all the reviews for a movie together with no regard for seperate releases from different companies. You can only have one review at a time for a given movie. However, YOU CAN DELETE YOUR REVIEW OF THE BAD COPY AND LEAVE A REVIEW OF THE \\"AUTHENTIC COLLECTOR'S EDITION\\", as I'm doing now.<br /><br />Now for the movie; this is both a great western and a great comedy. It has a fantastic cast directed by Andrew V. McLaglen. The remastered and restored Collector's Edition from Batjac Productions is the one to get. This is the best way to view the movie short of seeing it on the big screen!
B00005JMFQ|3.0|If 90 minutes of playful, self-conscious humor of romantic comedies presses all the right buttons for you, does it follow that two hours or so of the same playful, self-conscious humor will appeal to you even more? No, it turns out, it doesn't necessarily. If there were one thing I'd suggest to someone before even renting this movie, it might be to remind them simply that a movie is a good chunk of time out of your life which you won't be getting back; choose accordingly. This does NOT mean you shouldn't watch \\"Love Actually\\", but I WOULD like to draw a distinction between fluff and non-fluff romantic comedy, and the fact that \\"Love Actually\\" certainly falls into the latter category. How can one say it? A movie like \\"Sleepless in Seattle\\", there you watch it because you know all the plot, acting etc. is all basically manipulated so that your heartstrings will get pulled, but clandestinely. You know THAT ahead of time. In \\"Love Actually\\", on the other hand, it's like you're supposed to fill that void yourself - I mean specifically the one where the emotional and dramatic elements should be (to be yet more blunt, the elements that make us care about the characters. Any sense of plot or conflict serves only as a scaffolding for the situation comedy and warm and/or fuzzy moments which, after all, make up the ostensible, visual substance of films in this genre. \\"Sleepless in Seattle\\" had those moments, but it had a lot underneath; this movie however defintely has a residual nature to it. (I should say \\"Sleepless in Seattle\\" is one of only two or three other romantic comedies I think I've ever seen, but I'm pretty sure it bears the role of archetypal romantic comedy pretty well).<br />The positive points: I'll never understand this, but Hugh Grant is ALWAYS funny. He plays the Prime Minister of GB. In one scene (after the President of the US, played by Billy Bob Thornton in yet another inexplicable cameo, has sexually harassed his secretary), he tells a throng of reporters that Britain \\"shall not give in\\" or something to America's interests. It's completely out of left field and completely implausible, but it's just great. Meanwhile, said secretary (I don't remember who she was played by, there're about 20 characters) has enough beauty and sweetness to stock the whole of the movie; jokes are made throughout about her weight yet she is consistently the most interesting and convincing female character...which is another positive point. If you don't like one storyline, it won't be too long before the perspective shifts.<br />The main negative point of course is what I already alluded to, namely, that NONE of the characters really gets developed. There's just too many of them, and even with the two hours (hence why \\"LA\\" is sure to wear out many welcomes) you end up not feeling like you've really seen anything of them. But again, if all you're after is diversion, \\"Love Actually\\" has a great atmosphere to it and, admittedly, a few pleasant examples of post-90s situation comedy.
B00008NG5V|4.0|one of the reasons i ever want to pick up a guitar and learn it is so i can cover jack johnson songs over the campfire. just like the rest of america i had no clue who jack johnson was. except i heard him on a number of message boards and everyone says he plays mellow hawaian songs. so i decided i needed a few mellow cds in my collection and i got on and on. i cant say im speechless or that it sucks or anything all i can say is it totally met my expectations. i mean none of the songs are quite memorable but they all have the same effect i like that. its a great cd to pop on when your on a long trip and its raining. i like it because its not too poppy but very simple if anything everyone needs a cd like this in their collection
B0000028RR|5.0|Rage Against The Machine are the best political band in the music world. No-one can compare to these guys when it comes to political hard-rock. This is a flawless debut album from these guys. Zack De La Rocha is the perfect lyricist/vocalist, yelling and rapping about the corruption of politics these days. Tom Morello's guitars definately make the freakiest noise, which makes it cool too, but Timmy C and Brad Wilk are good with bass and drums as well. This CD has 10 cool tracks. From the opener, Bombtrack, to the two middles, Bullet In The Head and Know Your Enemy, to the finale, Freedom, this CD is phenominal. To the one song review.<br />1)Bombtrack(4:04) - The bass opener really makes it perfect to start bringing the drums in. It's pretty cool. The shortest song, and second-to-third most radio-friendly. Not a favourite, but still better than others. 3.5/5<br />2)Killing In The Name(5:14) - Now we get from Bombtrack to a very heavy start, followed by some of the best guitar work I've ever heard. Although the lyrics tend to get a bit repetitive. It's still my 3rd favourite song. The final message is really cool. \\"F*** you, I won't do what you tell me.\\" 5/5<br />3)Take The Power Back(5:37) - Not a favourite, for me it tends to drag on, but still good. Not much to say about this song. 3.5/5<br />4)Settle For Nothing(4:48) - Quiet song, at least for the first minute. Once it gets heavy, it becomes the perfect original song. A standout. 4/5<br />5)Bullet In The Head(5:10) - Tied with Know Your Enemy for 2nd best song. It seems a little boring, but it's just your regular political rock song. Bullet In The Head is simply a perfect standout. \\"Yellow ribbon instead of a swastika.\\" It's great. 5/5<br />6)Know Your Enemy(4:55) - Like I said, tied with Bullet In The Head for 2nd place. This is a total non-stop rock song. Somewhere near the 3 minute mark, the lead singer from Tool sings the soft talk, but then... \\"Time, has, come, to, PAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!\\" It's a real cool song. Another standout. 5/5<br />7)Wake Up(6:04) - Well, this is where it gets a little boring. It sort of drags on for a little, but not enough to skip it. It IS listenable, just not a fave. It isn't the worst song, Fistful Of Steel ends up with that honor. 3.3/5<br />8)Fistful Of Steel(5:31) - This is my least favourite song on the album. It seems long again. But still, it's not a skipper. It's just a little boring to me. 3/5<br />9)Township Rebellion(5:24) - We near the end on a good note, unlike Wake Up and Fistful Of Steel, Township Rebellion gives it a funky feel to an already heavy song. The speed of the song shows you what Freedom will pick up. It's really good, heading into the phenominal Freedom. 4.5/5<br />10)Freedom(6:05) - Best song on the album, Hands-Down. It's awesome in the studio, even more awesome live. This song, is the longest song, but still, it's nice to hear different verses of the song, and a very freaky but cool guitar solo by the great Tom Morello. Zack De La Rocha really shines in this, as well as Bullet In The Head and Know Your Enemy. The stuff at the end is really cool. 6/5<br />Well, that's that. Go, and get this album, but go check out Evil Empire and Battle Of L.A. as well.
B0000508U6|5.0|The raw emotion of this album would make it almost unbearable if not for the bittersweetness through which the band relays their messages. There is hope (Yellow) and hopelessness (Spies), guilt (Trouble) and vulnerability (Shiver), and a charism for life (High Speed) as well as ethereal status of perfect bliss (We Never Change). Think of Cesar Vallejo's immortal epic poesy, &quot;Trilce,&quot; and extend the soul of the piece into these British lads, their skillfully written rhythm structures and their consummate musicianship.
0671027387|4.0|While reading this book, all I could keep thinking was, &quot;Haven't I already read this...twice?&quot;  After reading Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code by Brown, I hoped this would be a little different, but it wasn't.  Brown uses pretty much the exact same formula in this book that he did in the other two with respect to plot development and characterizations.<br />All three books start off with the protaganist waking up expecting it to be an ordinary day, only to be whisked all around the world chasing after earth shatteringly huge information about secrets which go to the highest levels of whatever, that people will kill to protect.  In the meantime, someone else is working against them to keep the secrets hidden and there is a shadowy unscrupulous organization killing people who get in the way.  As good guys turn into bad guys and bad guys turn into good guys, the plot twists and turns through wild speculative leaps of logic that turn out to be right on the button, characters out-guessing so-called experts in areas that they are not qualified to speculate about, and missing simple things that they should know easily from their own areas of expertise.  Of course, the characters are able to instantly overcome MAJOR trauma along the way, and perform death defying stunts, all in a completely implausible, if not impossible, time frame.  Throw in a family connection with one of the key players, and a completely superfluous love story and you have a Dan Brown thriller.<br />Having said all that, and knowing that I cannot think of a single good thing to say about the book looking back on it, I gave it 4 stars because, despite the mess that it was, it kept me on the edge of my seat, and I was definitely entertained by it...somehow.  I'd like to say that I won't be reading anymore of Brwon's books since they are so incredibly similar, but I've already started Digital Fortress.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|What else can be said about ROCK'S  most explosive band,then that their back........sort of?. Their new Greatest Hit's package explores and relives the bands sound of the past twenty years, that very sound that to this day is duplicated by bands like Limp bizkit to Velvet Revolver (a.k.a) the New GN'R. One thing that for sure can be said about this record is that it is truly the Alpha and Omega of what a greatest hits package should be about. Axel keeps the album to the bare essentials the tunes that made GN'R the number 1 band in the world from 1986 - 1992.
B000002NIW|3.0|dont get me wrong this album is a very good album its hrad to give it a 3 but i dont think it quite got up to a four. the only time i give out 3s is when i think most of the songs were bland or sounded the same. i heard about the deftones when i saw the video for change(in the house of flies) great song, great video. then i forgot about them until their new cd came out and every body was talking about them. so i thought i would get one of their cds and i got this one. this is a world before the whole screaming thing became mainstream so when people really screamed it was really emotional. and thats what i thought every time there was screaming i thought it was very emotional. the singer himself is very unique and the band has got the mid temp thing down tight and they do a very good job. but i didnt think they changed pace enough or didnt things too dofferently i just thought they didnt have that key component to drive them over the edge.
B0000CFW87|5.0|This is an amazing CD! I do not think there is one song on this that I do not enjoy listening to. WoW! In fact it is so good I am sending it as a gift to the rest of the family! If you love Andrea Boccelli then you will melt when you hear Josh Groban. Track 10 is my absolute favorite! Great BUY!
B00018D44U|4.0|Generally, I listen to music that reinforces the mood I'm in, simply because there are few albums I've heard that can really shift my mood. This is one of them. There is no voice quite like Norah Jones, and it imparts a soft warmth that does not remove the emotional edge of her songs. Rather, the excellent accompaniment by the Handsome Band allows the listener to indulge in the emotion at a slow pace, taking time to appreciate each measure of the harmony. This is an excellent piece of jazz fusion, with overtones of country and blues.<br />Why only 4 stars then? This is great reading music, great wine-drinking music, nice for dancing, kissing and missing someone on a rainy day at home alone. But it's a little out of my forte. Still, if you have to apologize to someone special in your life, buying this CD and lighting some candles is an excellent invitation to forgiveness.
B00018D3RI|5.0|This set is a must have for any fan of the show! I have savored every minute of watching these episodes completely uninteruppted.This show created characters that are memorable and engaging nearly 30 years later. This was the first box set I have ever purchased and I can not wait for season 2!
B00005JM02|5.0|A great fishy tale about a traumatized father, Marlin, who is overprotective of his only son, Nemo. When Nemo lashes out to challenge his fathers overbearingness he suddenly ends up in the situation his father has been dreading all along. Caught in open water by humans and off to a dentists aquarium.<br />Marlin then starts the long search to find him, meeting up with soom interesting charcters along the way.  The most induring and nearly scene stealing is of his forgetful companion, Dory, voiced by Allen deGeneris.  She comes accross really well.<br />Nemo finds himself trapped but with new friends and soon plots an escape.<br />The team at Pixar have really excelled and it is such a shame that it takes so long to make this type of animated movie.  A great film for the whole family but might be a bit scary for little ones.
B000002UY5|5.0|my first listen to blind melon was a freak accident. i was watching the retrospective on headbanger's ball when they showed a part about blind melon and they played a 4 second clip of 'no rain' i thought it was nice. im into nirvana and pearl jam and they had that sound. so when i got the disc i was expectant. Whoa! from the beginning to the very end this band put me on edge. the thing to realize is every member of the band is completely individualistic yet perfectly together in harmony its incredible i thought no rain was one of the worser songs after listening to the whole record its totally worth the buy
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|We listen to Music Choice Metal (910 on Mediacom Cable) every day.  Late one night in December, I was falling asleep when &quot;Unholy Confessions&quot; started playing.  I was wide awake instantly!  I had never even heard of A7X before, and WITHOUT DOING ANY FURTHER RESEARCH, that one song was enough to convince me that I had to buy the CD immediately.  The next day, I bought it at CD Warehouse.  As soon as I got out to my car, I put Waking The Fallen in my CD player.  It has been there for 3 months.  I drive 140 miles to work and back, 5 days a week, and I won't even take it out of my car to listen to it at home or work because I don't want to accidentally leave it!  It's just an incredible CD.  I love the heaviness.  I love the perfect mixture of growls, screams, and vocals.  Each song is unique and fabulous, just like A7X is.<br />In the April 2004 issue of Stuff Magazine, on page 86, Avenged Sevenfold is listed as a runner-up for the &quot;Best artist you'll soon be hearing about&quot;.  Can a nation-wide tour, with a stop in KC, be far behind?
B000069AUI|4.0|There is only one thing lacking in this follow-up to the incredible &quot;Parachutes,&quot; and that is an indulgence on part of the band into the more gentle side of their expressions, which leaves a small unbalance towards an understated side. Then again, Coldplay are masters of gentle statement and the sublime messages of music. But all other factors that made their debut like sunshine on a lovesick soul - consummate music craft, patience and temperance in their playing, a determined and steadfast character to lyrics and arrangement - are still present here. EAGERLY looking forward to album #3.
1401201911|5.0|Probably one of the best &quot;what if&quot; stories i have ever read. It has all the elements of a great grophic novel. Good story telling, good art, and exelent dialogue.
B0000A02TZ|5.0|Animal House is the funniest movie ever made, period! On the AFI's list of the top 100 funniest movies ever, Animal House is 36, there wrong!!! Animal House has the funniest stuff, and when you least expect it, a car always runs into something!!! The best scene is in the cafeteria, all hell breaks loose!!!
B0000DJZ7W|5.0|Without a doubt listening, enjoying and understanding the passion that Celine pours into each one of her songs is one of the great prizes of speaking French. There are no power-ballads and not so many high notes in this album as it is a more intimate and personal. I love it, this is the perfect mixture of pop, rock and country like rythms. I love it, from &quot;Tout l'or des hommes&quot;, to &quot;Le vol d'un ange&quot;, &quot;Je lui dirai&quot; to her superb performance of &quot;Je t'aime encore&quot;, every song is unique and wonderful. Well produced, mixed and arranged, no wonder it was an instant hit in Quebec and France!
B000002LPD|1.0|This is not just one of the worst Van Halen Albums, this is one of the worst Albums ever.  The new lead vocals are awful.  The songs are slapped together.  This album will even make you long for the VanHagar erra.<br />It is a sad sad day for Van Halen fans.
B00000FCBC|5.0|Man, my friend bought this CD for me used, and i thought it would suck.  BUT IT DIDN'T!!!  This CD rocked i thought i would pass out because it was used and it skipped and I did not want to miss a second.  If you see this CD pick it up, it's great.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I had seen it in the theater when it was released and had to go back to see it again.  Being a fan of time travel movies, this was that and even more as I discovered.  Along with another great time paradox movie 12 Monkeys, I have my own copies of both films. Like 12 Monkeys, it's one of these pictures you can see over and over and find something you missed.  I will add that the casting is brilliant in Donnie D (like 12 Monkeys), as the actors chosen to play these characters exhibit the perfect amount of quirkiness that was needed for their roles for the film to work, in the way it does.  All the elements of the film that were employed together, time travel, teen angst (as controlled by PROZAC, an accepted practice for just about any ailment today), the \\"political correctness\\" of the 80's (including the accurate 88' election timeline between Democratic hopeful Dukakis and Republican G. Bush senior, when many banked on and hoped a Dukakis win would have ended the Reagan/Bush era that still haunts us even today with our current Pres G.Dubya Bush), the music, disillusionment, hope, innocence, spirituality, horror and love all combined and interwoven into the story are what make this film this what it is.  This perfectly accurate snapshot of the October 1988 timeline used in the film as the backdrop are what makes and gives this film the feel it has. Understand that October 1988 was the specific point in time selected for this movie for a reason and needs to be noted. Imagine where our country would be today if Dukakis had won.<br />Another note I wanted to make was that this movie was realeased in theaters on October 26th, 2001, just 6 weeks after September 11th attack.  This was the first film I went to see after the attack. The jet engine falling into the house in the film was very ironic in it's timing to a current major world changing event and the realese date of the film. It shook everyone up in the theater including me.  The audience I'm sure like me thought immedietly of the planes hitting the twin towers, the death and destruction that was played over and over in the news and film footage. Just the image of this falling jet engine out of the sky crashing into the house in this film alone was very powerful, and the fact that it happened to be this now dark \\"symbol of terror\\" in both the film and in real life, post 9/11.  This \\"symbol of terror\\" was just one of the objects we had been seeing everynite for weeks on our TV screens crashing out of the second Twin Tower and onto the streets of New York on 9/11,  and was now being used in this film I was seeing just after the attack was chillingly ironic.  It was chilling to see this scene playing out on the big screen just weeks after being witness to one of the darkest events in our countries present history.  It had a very powerful impact.<br />This event happens somewhat early in the film and is THE pivitol event to the storyline. In the theaters after the crash thundered through the theater in Dolby THX surround sound with 1000 watts, the audience was so captivated from that point on that you could hear a pindrop between lines of diologue.  The 9/11 event did influence my first perception of this movie and perhaps the impact it has had on me since.  It made me THINK.  I then began to wonder, what if DUKAKIS was actualy elected?  Would we have been attacked?  It was a very weird coincidence this movies release coinsided with one of the worst events in American history, and that a part of the storyline happened to capture another period of time that could have changed it all.  Quite a revalation I had watching this film that day in the theater.  I walked out of the theater stunned. By the way, I did vote for Dukakis, adding to the irony.<br />October, 1988 was a pretty weird time and so was October, 2001.  So coincidently it had to be a weird movie. Right?<br />Donnie D is provocative.  For those who did not like the film, look up the definition of provocative.<br />For those who may not \\"get\\" the movie, your were'nt supposed to.  It's only supposed to \\"get\\" you to think. So if you didn't \\"get\\" the movie.....perhaps the thinking part is hardest for you to \\"get\\".....and not the movie.<br />The fact that there are over 550 reviews on Amazon on this film as of 3/7/2004 reflects it's impact.<br />Another interesting point is that this was Drew Barrymore's own film companies very first release.  She IS listed in the credits as \\"Executive Producer\\".  She knew it was a brilliant concept and screenplay and wanted to be a part of it. She waived her usual acting fee just to be in it and play the part she wanted as one of the teachers.  On the DVD extras, she shares her comments.  Check it out.
B000089CJI|5.0|The Postal Service fills a gap in music that very few other bands have recognized.  Yet, this type of music is essential in the description of our postmodern lives.  <BR>The music is a rich, powerful, and personal experience layered over complex, often interestingly synchopated, rythms of electronic glitches and perfect basses.  The sound is extremely stark and warm at once, a very human experience within an electronic, fragmented setting that is a perfect description for our lives.  This is why the music triggers something deep in the core and you'll find yourself completely addicted.<BR>The album does well on all levels.  It is musically complex, new, involving, and above all - good.  &quot;The District Sleeps Alone Tonight&quot; is the first and best song.  It encompasses all of what The Postal Service do best.  The beat has a great feel, but complex rythm.  The singing is personal and close with somewhat abstract lyrics.  Backup female vocals add a welcomed glimmer, and a little guitar gives the song some rock edge.<BR>Some of the middle songs seem to be made for the sake of getting the album up to a full 10 songs to make the album an LP, but they are still great (just less than par compared to some of the much better tracks that the band pulls off).  Overall, the duo seems to be greater than the sum of its parts, which is saying a lot given the proven track record of each member.<BR>If you like this, listen to The Notwist - Neon Golden, Prefuse73 - One Word Extinguisher, Mediafriend - The Condition Of The Human Voice (available only at [...] , with downloads at that site), Jay Jay Johanson -  Poison, and Arab Strap - Elephant Shoe.
B00000I14Z|5.0|This is a wonderful album from the volatile genius of bassist, composer and arranger, Charles Mingus.  The songs are all either classics or deserve to be--<BR>'Better git it in your soul' is a swirling, bubbling act of creative inspiration; 'Goodbye Pork Pie Hat' is a lovely introspective tribute to the then recently deceased tenor sax giant Lester Young; 'Fables of Faubus' is a satirical dig at a racist politician; 'Self Potrait in 3 colours' written though never used, for a film, is beautiful, etc etc.<BR>The playing is very good, especially the whole ensemble-individual playing not as striking individually as the great jazz players, although Mingus was a great bassist, Jimmy Knepper a wonderful trombonist, and Danny Richmond a phenomenal drummer.<BR>This shows what jazz can, and should do.  Unmissable.
0440237688|5.0|This book is really interesting. It shows how sometimes that life isn't what some people really image on how it's going to be. To me, the position that he is in isn't something that I could see myself in but maybe it could happen, because you never really know.
B00005JMNA|3.0|I found the movie to be full of color and music, however I found it to be weak. The ending was a great disappointment. What I didn't understand was, why was it taking place in the 50's when the music was out of place. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the music but it didn't seem to go with the movie. I thought the movie had great potential and could've been better.<br />I think it is important when going to see this movie not to compare to the Original Dirty Dancing. This is not the same movie!
B000003TA4|5.0|Since hearing Smells Like Teen Spirit in the background of some TV show in '02, This album, and other Nirvana releases, have changed my life. I listen to most of it every day and have taken up the guitar because of it.<BR>10 of the 12 tracks are great and about six (Smells like teen spirit, In Bloom, Come as you are, Territorial Pissings, Lithium and Drain You) are solid gold classics.<BR>When i first got it i thought it was released recently (I was that ignorant) and it sounded completely current, i was shocked when i learned it came out when i was a toddler! (I'm only 15).<BR>It sired many imitators (All generation-defining groups do) and defined 90's, and 2000's rock, the latest bands sound really lame compareed to it. <BR>Only one rock group has captured my attention almost as much as Nirvana: Dave Grohl's Foo Fighters.<BR>Buy this, and other Nirvana albums, and you will listen to them every day, and be happy

B0000E6I1J|5.0|This is a concert that will absolutely break your heart and move you if you love George Harrison or the Beatles. It is lovingly produced and as emotional as anything I have ever heard relating to any of the Beatles. I've listened to it many times and still am not weary of it, and I doubt any of you will be.<br />There are so many wonderfully poignant moments, Clapton singing &quot;If I Needed Someone,&quot; Joe Brown singing &quot;Here Comes The Sun,&quot; etc.  When McCartney is singing &quot;For You Blue&quot; it is marvelous.<br />Clapton is magnificent and understated. He plays lead guitar only once throughout the entire concert, and that is appropriately on &quot;White My Guitar Gently Weeps.&quot; He sings lead on a few Beatles tracks, but lays back most of the concert, careful not to overshadow the moment or the memory. Jeff Lynne also does a fine job. Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers sing &quot;Taxman&quot; and &quot;I Need You,&quot; but one wishes Eric would have taken over both those songs.<br />The applause when Ringo appears is deafening and the infectious way he sings &quot;Photograph&quot; and &quot;Honey Don't&quot; will have you clapping your hands and smiling all over. It must be impossible not to adore Ringo.<br />And what about Paul? He took so much needless criticism for his appearence here. Many discussions and reviewers claimed he was petulant that Clapton overshadowed him, that his applause wasn't as loud as Ringo's and countless other nit-pickings. I've watched Paul all my life and rarely have I seen him as moved, teary-eyed and emotional as he was this evening. He packed his ego away and did George and the fans proud. Watch Paul as he strums the ukelele while singing &quot;Something.&quot; It's obvious he is struggling not to break down and cry. Clapton later said &quot;Paul was never close to George,&quot; but Eric is wrong. From 1957-1967 they were very close and Paul knows this. The scenes with Paul are my favorites, he acquits himself beautifully. His version of &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; is absolutely brilliant.<br />While no fan of Ravi's music, even this Indian segments are moving and move along at a rapid clip. Another highlight is Billy Preston belting out the second chorus of one of George's masterpieces, &quot;Isn't it a Pity.&quot;<br />I can's say enough superlatives about this album. All George and Beatles fans will cherish this concert.autifully.

B000002J1Y|5.0|I haven't a penchance for live CDs, I usually feel that they reflect a tired, worn-out artistry which is more for profiteering than for music. However, &quot;Yessongs&quot; is a clear contradiction to this sentiment. The members of Yes play frantically and energetically, and rather than deviating from the studio recordings, they follow them - but not without their own modifications, making it &quot;live.&quot;<br />The clarity of this compact disc is unsurpassed: There is little to be desired of the sound quality, particularly for a live recording. The remastered edition is spectacular, its clarity is excellent: No pops or fuzziness.<br />Yes manages to put together some of their most rambunctious works (Note that I am listening to &quot;Siberian Khatru&quot; off of the first disc as I write this), and fuse them to a definitively live style. They play with energy, punctuated with a few artistically-licensed spurts on the keyboard and guitar. Strung together, these two discs are a fantastic testament to Yes' ability as musicians and as performers: They are talanted and not afraid to have fun onstage - two things clearly reflected in Yessongs.<br />I wholeheartedly recommend this CD set, even if all of the songs on it are owned on studio recordings. The energy within this album literally feels like the listener is there, listening to Steve Howe and the rest jam away. Really a masterpiece.
B00012FXAE|5.0|I realize Ridley Scott's first 'ALIEN' movie will always be cherished for what is the introduction of a great movie franchise. But Cameron knew how to take a risk to improve upon a genre classic. The 'ALIENS' Collector's Edition DVD with added material, while not wholly essential, does make this ultimate popcorn-chomper even better. Might I also point out that the movie is still well paced with the bonus material. Now in an age where people can tolerate epic length stories, ALIENS is still the joyride is was on initial release.<br />Sigourney Weaver is in top form. The screenplay allows her doubt and fear to dictate the whole film. Her first suspicions of Burke and Bishop (obviously because of his 'synthetic' build) create another layer of drama along with having to work with strangers to kill her worst nightmare. Her peformance earned her an award nomination in a genre long neglected by the Oscars.<br />Well casted as well were the Marines deployed for the 'bug hunt'. Most notable obviously is Bill Paxton as Pvt. Hudson. He gets to deliver the lines all actors with a grudge dream about. And you will still hear people reciting them from time to time in his own charismatic way. Jenette Goldstein as Pvt. Vasquez was notable as well. But all the Marines played the part well as arrogant soldiers who dash their invincibility when faced with a worthy foe in the Xenomorphs. Maybe the riskiest move was Carrie Henn as the child Newt. With the expectations and budget riding high, it may have proved disastorous if this vital role didn't pan out. But Carrie was flawless as the displaced survivor and her interacion with Sigourney very believable.<br />The Collector's Edition DVD package is a bargain for the content given. While it's not entirely endless information, it's enough to illustrate the work poured into production. Most notable was the segment on the obstacles during the shoot. Cameron definitely did not treat this movie in a casual sense (as he never does) as it always shows onscreen.<br />If you are a collector and need at least one 'horror' or 'action' flick in your library, 'ALIENS' will satisfy both conditions with style and content.s onscreen.<BR>If you are a collector and need at least one 'horror' or 'action' flick in your library, 'ALIENS' will satisfy both conditions with style and content.
B0000VAFO0|5.0|I generally believe that this movie rocks. Of course that is my own oppinion. Many people disagree because Underworld does NOT follow the typical view of vampires and werecreatures, but who said that one's imagination had to stay in the box?<BR>  Watching the making of this movie amazed me, as to what techniques they used and the near-total lack of digital animation. It's great!
B00008J4P5|4.0|I was turned on to the band after viewing their live appearance on (think) the grammy's.  This happened for me last year as well when I saw the Foo Fighters completely ROCK at some european awards show as well.  My feeling is that if a band can turn a lame live audience inside out- they deserve to have a listen.  <br />Seven Nation Army is the album's stand out single- and deservedly so - but the rest of the album plays excellently and shows why the Whites have such a diverse following<br />My personal recommendation is to listen to as many of the cuts on the album as you can to get a sense of whether this is the album you want.  I have seen many complaints from readers that they purchased Elephant b/c they loved the single and that they are unhappy with the other songs.
0385504209|5.0|What a great book.  It's a quick read, but very engaging.  I saw a few reviews from people clearly upset by the fact that this story may call into question their faith.  For me, it's just a great story that weaves reality into the fiction.
B00006RCNW|4.0|This is the best show on TV. Watching both 1st and 2nd season straight through (or at least in a shorter time period) adds so much more.  Makes the stories and the plot that much deeper.<br />Great purchase
078681859X|3.0|It took me a while to get into this book; I found Bartemeus's footnotes a bit annoying, I wasn't too impressed with the writing, and the plot was okay. But after a little while, I got caught up in it and couldn't stop reading it. I just wanted to find out what would happen next! <BR>One thing that kind of made me nervous though, was the fact that in this book, the source of magic is demons, which kind of sounds like the controversy surrounding the Harry Potter books. I wasn't very comfortable with that, and especially with the fact that in this book, most magicians seem to be ambitious and self-centered. Not very good role models for children. Parents should probably read this book before allowing their children to read it.
B000006U44|5.0|I heard the song \\"Moving\\" when I was only 8 years old, and it <BR>burned into my heart for nearly 20 years. I'd downloaded it <BR>once, and the indescribably solitary beauty let me bought this <BR>CD last week irresistibly. It doesn't disappoint me, it's great!<BR>I play this CD almost everyday.<br />This is what I call CLASSIC.
B000002AE3|3.0|I suppose I should start off by admitting my bias to their 80's albums - noteably Toto IV, Fahrenheit and The Seventh One. Since those albums, in the 90's and now into the early 2000's it appears that Toto has went back to it's &quot;roots&quot; as it were, by bringing back Bobby Kimball on lead vocals and returning to their old-style 70's rock sound - more noticeable on &quot;Kingdom of Desire&quot; and &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot; but still noticeable on &quot;Tambu&quot; as well. <br />I personally don't care for their old style rock sound. I never liked their first 3 albums (with the exception of a song or 2) and I really don't care for any of their new albums, other than this one which I think is pretty good. I personally would like to see them return more to the sound they had on Fahrenheit and The Seventh One - can they still get Williams back on vocals????<br />I've seen Bobby Kimball perform before at one of his solo shows a few years back - he's just not that good of a singer or lead man. Lukather is better at this than Kimball.<br />But with specific regards to &quot;Tambu&quot; there is an interesting mix of ballads and then that old style rock sound that Toto seems to think defines who they are. If I may be so bold, I think when all is said and done, Toto will be remembered for their pop hits in the 80's not the attempts that they have made at rock. To me, fewer bands have put together better or more beautiful ballads than Toto, but many bands rock better than Toto. Do what you are best at guys!<br />There are some nice ballads on this album, but all of them are depressing, not inspirational ballads as some of their past ballads have been (e.g. &quot;Could This Be Love&quot; from Fahrenheit). And gone from this album are those nice pop hits that many Toto fans came to expect of Toto (e.g. Pamela, Rosanna). <br />Overall, I have to call this album a disappointment, but I still give it 3 stars because it is their best effort of the 90's and thereare some enjoyable songs on here. Much better than &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot; or &quot;Kingdom of Desire&quot;!
B0000C7PQK|5.0|Voyageur has been a topic of controversy since it came out.  A lot of good has been said about it, but it has recieved a lot of bad reviews, too many in my opinion.  Why all the bad reviews?<BR>Before that can be answered, we should ask, why do so many people love Enigma?<BR>I think an appropiate and general answer would be that its different.  Enigma steps away from mainstream music, creating its own genre.  When I first started searching for Enigma cds in stores, I didn't know where to look first.  Its music covers so many different categories that you can't single it out to just one category.<BR>People love Enigma because it is so unique.  It creates such stunning moods and visuals inside your head.  Enigma is something you don't hear when you turn on the radio.  I think people enjoy hearing something new, but it seems that not everyone does.<BR>People loved Enigma when it had the same Gregorian chants, horns, and whispers throughout all of their cds. But if you notice, people have become very critical of Enigma since the 4th album; The Screen Behind the Mirror.  And why is this?  Because it was different.  A different approach was taken in the making of the cd.  After three cds, Cretu decided to change the sound a little bit, just as he completely did in Voyageur.  <BR>You think this would be welcomed.  But it wasn't, people wanted the same old stuff, sort of like an Enigma mainstream.  What is the point in buying Enigma cds if they are all the same?!<BR>That's no fun to buy an album and to already know what it will sound like before you even listen to it.<BR>Voyageur is an experience, not a tragedy!  Everyone is complaining about silly lyrics, especially on Boum Boum.  That is stupid to do so.  Explaining your emotions in a song doesn't require an elaborate report that sounds like it came from Harvard.  If you listen to Boum Boum it makes sense.  When you think of someone you love, your heart just pounds away a mile a minute.<BR>Voyageur is still Enigma.  It isa new direction, but well worth a listen. I would think more Enigma fans would feel this way.

B00005JLZN|4.0|After watching this very good movie on DVD I would definitely have to say that it would've been nice to have watched it on the silver screen.  &quot;The Life of David Gale&quot; is a remarkably well told story that albeit fiction could very easily be a true story based on the convictions of those who agree with either side of the death penalty debate.  From the overall theme or premise of this story to the performances, &quot;The Life of David Gale&quot; is most definitely a very good story that falls into the category of films which makes you think your way through it.  Although many films in this particular genre suffer at the hands of predictability, this film doesn't in the least.<br />Performance wise, Kevin Spacey does his normal great job of playing your somewhat average to just above average American in this film.  I believe that is what most people find appealing about his performances in major films; he's pretty much your average guy.  I believe that prior to watching this film the only thing I had ever watched Kate Winslet in was &quot;Titanic&quot; and we all know how well that worked out for this beautiful British actress.  Her performance in this film is a very good one; it would be nice to see her in future films.  Laura Linney does her usual job of great acting in this film as well.  No matter what films I've ever watched her in she always gives a compelling performance.<br />Director Alan Parker does a wonderful job with this film from every aspect of telling this story.  The amazing thing about how he directed the film is that when it comes to the death penalty debate, he keeps the film itself neutral, not leaning too heavily in either direction, despite his own convictions.<br />The Premise:<br />Kevin Spacey plays David Gale who is a Harvard graduate working as a professor at a Texas university.  His life is about to take a major turn for the worse as his marriage is falling apart and he's accused of a rape he didn't commit.  Despite the rape charge being dropped he loses all credibility to include his job and his status as a leader of an anti death penalty organization.  He then finds himself being charged with and convicted for the murder of a close friend of his and he gets the death penalty...  Move forward six years and it's less than a week away from his execution and he finally decides to give an interview but only to Bitsey Bloom (Kate Winslet) who takes it upon herself to prove his innocence...<br />What follows from there is a film that I would definitely recommend to any and all who are fans of films in this genre as the film is a highly intriguing and fairly suspenseful one.  {ssintrepid}<br />Special Features:<br />-Feature commentary with Director Alan Parker<br />-Deleted scenes with optional Director's commentary<br />-The Making of &quot;The Life of David Gale&quot;<br />-The music of &quot;The Life of David Gale&quot;<br />-DVD-ROM Features<br />-Theatrical trailerrge being dropped he loses all credibility to include his job and his status as a leader of an anti death penalty organization.

Since then, MI6 has recruited him to be a spy to check out this new computer, the Stormbreaker. This computer is being sent to all English schools as a token of appreciation by Herod Sayle. He had a contest and whoever won got to be the first to try out the new computer. MI6 replaces the real winner with Alex and he finds out what is going on. So the agency gives him a yo-yo with an unbreakable string, zit cream that eats through metal, and a game boy with 4 different games with different purposes. He finds out that Herod is actually trying to kill the people with a form of small pox. This is only activated by the master switch which will be turned on at 12:00. <BR> Will Alex Rider stop him or will the English school kids die? There are also other books of Alex Rider adventures by Anthony. There is Point Blank and Skeleton Key. I rate this book a 9 out of 10.
B00005JN08|4.0|Eurotrip is brought to us by the same people who brought us Road Trip and Old School, and it's not hard to tell.  Loaded with some predictable gags, ethnic stereotypes, and situations that could never ever happen in the real world; Eurotrip still manages to be the funniest film to be released yet this year.  High school graduate Scotty (Scott Mechlowicz) takes off to Europe after being dumped by his girlfriend in search of an obscenely hot German girl who he thought was a guy.  Along with him are three of his friends: Cooper (Jacob Pitts, who closey emulates a young David Spade, both physically and comically), Jamie (Travis Wester), and Jenny (Buffy the Vampire Slayer's Michelle Trachtenberg); all of whom travel from France to Amsterdam (naturally) and all over Europe getting into all kinds of mishaps.  While Eurotrip occasionally borderlines on stupidity, you won't be able to help yourself from laughing.  Featuring hilarious cameos from Matt Damon, Smallville's Kristin Kreuk, Lucy Lawless, and the always great Vinnie Jones.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|'Wow' is all I can say ... Sophia Coppola has just made up for ruining Godfather III.<br />This is just a wonderfully simple movie about the idea that some of the most touching moments in your life may be some of the briefest.<br />Coppola also does a terrific job of conveying that disconnected feeling that you can get when you travel to another country.  As if the world is still moving, but you're no longer a part of it, you're wandering around outside of it all.<br />I really could go on for an hour about all the ideas that Coppola, very subtly, pushes out there for her audience to think about.  What really impresses me though is that she managed to convey all of these themes without beating the audience (i.e. - me) over the head.  She really leaves A LOT out there for people to discover themselves.  I find that refreshing.<br />This is an intelligent movie that really is a must-see.  It's every bit as good as it was hyped up to be.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was shocked when I learned that this show had been prematurely cancelled.  The storylines, both long and short term gave us plenty to think about.  The humor is just plain refreshing.<P>Just simply one of the best sci-fi series ever put out.<P>I'd highly recommend picking this up.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Ah, Maynard James Keenan. He will never dissapoint his fans - that's one thing we can count on him for. While the dumb, \\"poppulurr\\" mainstream fads come in (\\"Right Thurrrrrrrr\\"?!?!?) and fade away, he stays true to his sound, and lasts on the music scene, whether he is in Tool, or A Perfect Circle, his other band that has been around since 2000 and scored a radio hit that same year with \\"Judith\\". Well, now, APC has released their second album. How does it hold up next to Mer De Noms, their previous release?<br />Pretty damn well, I say.<br />This is a great album. From the Tool-ish, calm-then-building-up-to-a-rocker-and-then-back-to-calm vibe of \\"The Package\\" (please note that this is the only song on the album that sounds like a Tool song), to the harder, political \\"Pet\\", it's definitely a superb aural experience. APC has done it again. My favorite songs (besides the above two listed) are \\"Weak And Powerless\\", \\"The Noose\\", \\"Blue\\", \\"The Outsider\\" and \\"A Stranger\\" (which is beyond words... you just have to hear it). But all of the songs are good.<br />Anyway, this album is amazing, and I recommend it to the following people:<BR>* Tool Fans<BR>* People looking for a more alternative Tool (although thats not quite what it is)<BR>* People who are just plumb sick of that dreck on the radio (Wimp Bizkit and Definitely-Not-Good Charlotte) and want something different<br />If you're one of those above people, than do yourself a favor and take the 13th step.<br />Also, I should note that this CD can't be burned because of some record company legal mumbo-jumbo, but that's okay... this one's worth the purchase.
0385504209|5.0|First, I think it is WONDERFUL that one book can create such controversy and inspire over 2000 readers to write a review.  I think that Dan Brown is one of the most brilliant writers of our time.<br />It can be very disconcerting when basic core religious beliefs are scrutinized and examined.  If you feel that it is wrong to ever question your beliefs or the Bible or Church - then it would probably be best not to read this book.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Kanye West has officially arrived!  The newest hip-hop senstation starts his career off like Jay-Z did with &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot;, one of the best debut's ever!  The great Jay-Z has retired but Kanye will more than fill his shoes.  By showing that he is the savior for Roc-A-Fella records, Kanye gives songs on this album that don't dissapoint.  Not a bad song on the cd!  The best song on &quot;College Dropout&quot; is &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot;, featuring mentor Jay-Z.  Other great songs include &quot;Through The Wire&quot;, &quot;Family Business&quot;, &quot;All Falls Down&quot;, and &quot;Jesus Walks&quot;.  For all of you out there who already own this masterpiece, you made a very smart choice.  For all the people who don't have it yet, I highly suggest you go get it as soon as possible.  After the first listen through the album, you'll find yourself pushing the repeat button on your stereo.  You can't go wrong with any artist from Roc-A-Fella records, especially the next great one Kanye West.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Back in 1997, my little cousin wanted me to discover a new group &quot;as big as the Beatle&quot; he said.  When I saw &quot;Karma police&quot; on the album I turned to him and said &quot;I know them&quot; the had a big sucess with the song &quot;Creep&quot; a while back and they have a couple of good songs from this album on radio.<br />Knowing at least four songs on this album, my first listening was focused on stuff I did not know.  I immediately got interested in song &quot;Climbing up the walls&quot; and I think it is my all time favorite Radiohead song (a bit scary and cacaphonic).<br />To date OK Computer is still my favorite Radiohead album.
B00004U8JV|1.0|Words are hard to find to describe this train wreck of a movie, but I will try. This disaster redefined what I thought of as a limp sequel, a vehicle driven by Hollywood greed. The plot, characters and situations insult our intelligence again and again, leaving me shaking my head in annoyance. Virtually every plot twist and decision made by the characters totally defies logic. A grammar school kid would not make the mistakes these &quot;seasoned experts&quot; did as they blundered from one scenario to the next. Lets see, they kidnap a baby T-Rex, run through the jungle covered in blood, remove ammo from each others guns, sleep with open food and bloody shirts directly next to them and scream and yell so loud that anything within a mile could hear them. Every character in this movie redefines idiocy...needless to say I rooted for the dinosaurs. That being said, the dinos did look pretty cool but even they didn't come close to saving this piece of garbage from total and complete worthlessness. Do not watch this movie under any circumstances; I think my IQ dropped 10 points in just one viewing.  Spielberg should hide his head in shame.
B00009V7P8|4.0|I didn't think much of Volcano when I first heard it, but it gradually grew on me.  After that, I fell in love with the rest of the album.  I can't say I absolutely love, love, love every song on the album, but it comes close.  Damien's lyrics and vocals touched me and made me smile, and I could listen to this album all day.  Totally recommended.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|I've listened to this CD so many times. Its really easy to visualize the part of the movie that went with the tracks, which is cool. When I was deciding whether or not to buy it, I was a little turned off by the fact that some people said that the quality wasn't top notch. But actually, I think that was due to whatever the person was playing the CD with (stereo, CD player, etc.). So ignore that fact. The only downside of the CD was the length/number of songs. 15 tracks is a typical number, but it seems the CD ends somewhat quickly. But there is enough to listen to, don't worry. Anyway, happy shopping and this item is a definate keeper for POTC fans everywhere. Can't wait for the second movie, 2005!
6305971099|1.0|Retarded sequel that has no real premise at all. The film brings in a new mysterious character that is dressed all in black and looks like an out of style cowboy (Billy Ray Cyrus, maybe?).<br />Picking up seconds after &quot;Halloween 4&quot; ends, Michael Myers escapes his mineshaft dilemma &amp; shacks up with a hermit to heal his wounds recieved from the film (in a gigantic loophole, the size of the Holland Tunnel, everyone who has seen these films knows that Myers only kills on Halloween so...., what the hell did he do for the other 364 days?!?!). At any rate, Halloween comes again and Michael awakens anew, killing off the hermit (his parrot lives), and continues his search for his niece, Jamie, who has become a traumatic mute, and posseses a psychic link with her Uncle only moments before he claims another life (she sees each death he commits through his eyes. Well, isn't that special?!?). Donald Pleasance returns for the fourth time as Dr. Loomis, hounding and hovering over Jamie (he says the lines, &quot;Where is he? Where?&quot;, &quot;Write it on the paper. Write it &quot;., &quot;Jamie, please tell me.&quot; about a thousand times). The final nail in the coffin is the assinine appearance of a stranger dressed all in black, who busts out Michael at the end of the film (he must be a real tight-ass because he came into town on a Greyhound bus). There really is nothing original about this series anymore.
6300263673|5.0|Dirty Dancing is about a girl named Baby Houseman( played by Jennifer grey ) who whent on a vaction with her family and finds the love of her life there. His name is Johnny Castle (played by HOTT patrick swayze), he was one of the many entertanment staff/ Dance instukter. Johonnys dance partener had to get and opperation because she got 'nocked up'. the only night she can get it was on the night of her compation with Johnny , so baby voilinters to learn the dance steps for her and do the dance. through out the whole time johnny was teaching her they started to fall in love, and johnny became 'baby's guy'. baby was ashamed to tell her father because he was a very complakated man but johnny didn't understaind that.johnny gets fired from his job for being with one of his students (baby). at the end johnny came back to do 'the final dance' for the talent show, and jake(babys father) understands that they love each-other.<br />I really liked the movie, but i disagree with one of the sence when johnnys says \\"no body puts baby in a corner\\", i think he should have said \\"no body puys MY baby in a corner\\"! after seeing this movie i became depressed, remembering that i'm alown but is a very good love story! <br />yours truly Sarah
6305971099|1.0|Useless, pointless, unscary, unfunny sequel that should have been thought over before it went before the lens. Donald Pleasance shows up for his paycheck and brings in a minamill performance as Dr. Loomis.<br />Taking place seconds after &quot;Halloween 4&quot;, Michael Myers escapes his mineshaft doom and floats down river, shacking up with a hermit and tending to his wounds inflicted in the film (in one of the film's Grand Canyon size loopholes, people who have seen the previous &quot;Halloween&quot;'s know that Michael only appears to kill on the Halloween holiday, so, the question is what does he do for the other 364 days of the year?!?!). But, Halloween has come once again and &quot;The Shape&quot; (Michael) rises to kill and continue his search for his niece. Jamie, Michael's niece, is now a traumatized mute, who has a psychic link to her Uncle (she sees the deaths of Michaels victims through his eyes) and the only person who knows where he is.<br />There is also a foolish plot thread about a mysterious cowboy mystery man (Toby Keith?) dressed all in black, who helps Michael with his escape at the end of the film. The film just plain sucks. The acting is atrocious. Donald Pleasance looms over Danielle Harris and repeats the same three lines over and over (&quot;Where is he, Jamie?! Where?!&quot;, &quot;Write it down, Jamie! Write it down!&quot;, &quot;HE is coming, I'm telling you!!&quot;) your rolling your eyes by the end of the movie. I laughed so hard when Danielle Harris started to pantomime her Uncle's actions, that I started choking on my popcorn! And as for the cowboy, I was waiting for the Waylon Jennings theme to the &quot;Dukes of Hazzard&quot; to start, when he first stepped off the Greyhound Bus (What!?!? No horse?). If you value life, such that it is, you shoud avoid this movie like the chicken flu.
B00005OM4N|5.0|This album has real great catchy songs with classics such as &quot;Cindarella&quot; &quot;Overprotected&quot; and many more great songs!<br />I highly suggest you pick up this great album if you like great POP catchy tunes with a mix of RnB!

6301969251|5.0|To be perfectly honest, I prefer [[ASIN:B0000633QW Jesus of Nazareth]] (1977).  I have tried three times to get into this version with Max von Sydow as \\"Jesus\\" in The Greatest Story Ever Told and that it is and I think it was wonderul for the people of 1965, that needed to see a film like this.  But tweleve years later, \\"Jesus Of Nazareth\\" (1977), a television mini-series was broadcast with Robert Powell as \\"Jesus\\".  It was so much more accurate and so emotional.    But now I will sit through 3 hours and 18 minutes of The Greatest Story Ever Told.  Here it my review:  The locations look like Arizona.  I enjoyed the beautiful locations and soundstage sets.  So many actors.  So many familar faces.  I dare not name them all here, but a few.  Jose Ferrer, Charlton Heston, Donald Pleasance, David McCullum, Telly Savalas, Roddy McDowall, Sal Mineo, Jamie Farr, Karen Black, Shelley Winters, Ed Wynn, Martin Landau, David Hedison, Sidney Poitier and John Wayne.  Many cameo appearances.  There are alot of gentile actors in the cast.  Jesus at the Grand Canyon?  Sometimes a little Hollywood magnificence is good for a film.  VHS version includes Overture, Intermission, Entr'acte, Exit music.  I prefer to see Max von Sydow as \\"Father Merrin\\" in [[ASIN:0790729385 The Exorcist]] (1973).
B0001AP12G|5.0|Kanye West does not have the best flow...<BR>Kanye West does not have the craziest rhymes out there...<BR>Kanye West does not have metaphors that take 10 listens to break open...<br />What Kanye West does have, is very good hip hop that gets its points across, and uses many pop culture references to help get its point across.  I listen to gangsta rap, all the way to the true underground like sage francis and chino xl, not to mention the very good mos def and talib kweli.  This excited me when i first got it though, because everything is very good...not so good that i gooed in my pants, but there just arent any bad things about this cd, except that it has to end.<BR>Kanye is one of the most honest rappers to come out recently, which is refreshing considering the 50 cent garbage thats played all over the place.  He knows who he is, and creates very entertaining and thoughtful rap.  <BR>If you are not sure if you would like kanye, his style comes somewhere in between kweli and mos def.  More layed back than kweli, more attacking than mos def.  His beats are always fun to listen to, if this were an instrumental album, it would still be worth buying.  Even the skits are really good, hilarious still when i listen to them. <BR>If you are tired of mainstream gangsta fake thug s***, then take a listen to kanye.  You wont be disapointed.
B000092ZYX|1.0|Come on Radiohead, my time is valuable. I don't like being duped into buying rubbish like this by those deluded, self-satisfied music critics.  You're on thin ice Thom. You better make the next album worth my while or I'll be starting a new anti-radiohead site in the near future.  It will most certainly talk about your selling out to the music industry, and how for the last fours you have been lazily resting on your laurels and relying on your loyal fan base to buy whatever mish-mash you decide to put out there.  It's time for honesty, and some real soul searching.  If this is the best you can do then you guys should stop making albums, because I for one will not stand for your half-hearted efforts.
B00005JM02|3.0|Inevitably, computer animated films will be compared against each other. I don't normally like doing that, but here a small bunch of films vie for the same market with the same qualities (technical excellence, anthropomorphic comedy and adult/kid crossover appeal) so it is a very easy thing to do.<br />On that basis, Nemo ranks well down the tables; behind Shrek, Monsters Inc and either instalment of Toy Story.<br />No quibbles technically. Extraordinary. But then again, the films in this bracket are all extraordinary, so it's not such a big deal. In any case technical virtuosity by itself does not great cinema make.<br />As a child placator, it can't match any of its Pixar predecessors or the brilliant Shrek. In fact, Nemo isn't really a kid's film at all. Our Monsters Inc-mad 3 year old, whose tastes are admittedly somewhat eclectic (also a big fan of Blade Runner, for some reason), was simply terrified and now refuses point blank to watch the DVD. I can see his point: Nemo is quite violent in places - it may be cartoon violence, but given the technical achievement, these cartoons are now so realistic that the very idea of cartoon violence begins to lose its meaning.<br />As a parent placator, Nemo isn't a great deal better. One of the truly shining qualities of the earlier Pixar releases is their rewatchability factor - since you are forced to endure them over and over at your children's behest, this is an inestimably vital quality. Every pass at Monsters Inc. reveals a fertile crop of partially buried cinematic references, visual gags and cheeky quips from background characters. Nemo is stonier ground. Nor is the script as funny - there are some nice touches, to be sure (Barry Humphries' Bruce the Shark is a cracker, but gets precious little screen time) and while Ellen DeGeneres' Dory is funny enough, in her I think the production doesn't have quite the same calibre of comic timing offered by a Billy Crystal, Tim Allen or Eddie Murphy.<br />The overall vibe of the picture - a cloyingly redemptive weepy, basically - is so Disney it hurts. In case you were wondering, I mean that in a bad way. The earlier Pixar movies largely avoided this, and were all the better for it. Nemo charts a course straight back into Bambi territory.<br />Apparently Pixar has nixed its relationship with Disney (I wonder if this sort of editorial influence in part brought that about), and it would do very well to go back to the anarchic post-modern comedy and lay off the maudlin moralising next time.<br />Lastly a couple of points on the DVD: as seems to be Disney's wont, the pre-menu stage is jammed with advertisements for other Disney pictures you have to actively avoid (though at least now you *can* actively avoid them - in Toy Story you have to cue through the blighters) and the making-of documentary reveals a horribly self satisfied bunch who were openly of the opinion that they were making one of the best movies of all time - which is a sure recipe for a stinker.<br />As it happens Nemo isn't a stinker, but it isn't a great film either. We're still in full-frontal Disney hype at the moment, of course, but I suspect time will come to judge Nemo rather more harshly than has the box office.<br />Watch those sale bins.<br />Olly Buxtonhe picture - a cloyingly redemptive weepy, basically - is so Disney it hurts.

B0001AP12G|5.0|This album is incredible. The more I hear it, the more I like it. It is the kind of album that you can do just about anything to. It is great to sit and listen to, but also great to just have on in the background while you chill or study. I even put it on when it is time to go to sleep. The beats are so smooth, the lyrics and rhymes just flow. Kanye knows what he is doing and does it well.
B00003CY6M|5.0|What a great movie !! Could watch it time and time again.
B00005JMNA|4.0|No, I didn't see this movie for the dancing, or to scope out Romola Garai.  I didn't even go to give a critical analysis of the depiction of Cuba on the fateful New Year's Eve 1958, even though the film's full theatrical title is: \\"Dirty Dancing Havana Nights Based On True Events\\".<br />None of that.  I went because it's \\"Dirty Dancing\\".  I saw the original in the theater when I was 13, just days after falling in love with a young blonde from Queens named Veronica, who I met a a Catskills resort nothing at all like Kellerman's.  I felt kinship with Baby, even though the only person who forbade my romance was Veronica herself, tragically into older men.  And now I wanted to see the followup, filmed in the same Old San Juan where I got engaged this winter.<br />\\"Dirty Dancing\\" and I matured together.  Over time I watched it blossom into a pop culture camp classic.  Who here of a certain age doesn't instinctively break into giggles upon hearing \\"Nobody puts Baby in the corner\\"?<br />\\"Havana Nights\\" brings out the big movie guns in an attempt to recapture the magic of the original.  This is a Miramax film, so you know Harvey Weinstein was putting in the late nights helping polish the rough cut into a theatrical diamond.  Lawrence Bender, who made his bones on the early Tarantino epics, produced.  Mya Harrison and Heather Headley both show up for star vocal turns.<br />And, of course, Patrick Swayze is back.  He is billed only as \\"Dance Class Instructor\\".  He appears in only two scenes (probably shot the same morning) and applauds and whistles in a couple of reaction-shot inserts, quite possibly filmed in his home, months after production wrapped.  But we all know who he is supposed to be.  Welcome back, Johnny Castle!<br />Swayze was in his early-to-mid 30s when the first \\"Dirty\\" came out.  Now he is 51, and playing the same character... but this movie set five years before the original.  He has aged remarkably well.  And this may create a market for Swayze power cameosin remakes of his earlier classics.  Who wouldn't relish the return of Dalton in \\"Road House Manitoba\\"?  Who doesn't want to see Swayze counseling \\"Los Angeles Ghost\\"?  The possibilities are endless.<br />\\"Havana Nights\\" gives you exactly what you would expect.  There's romance, attractive scantily-clad young people, a performance by Sela Ward modeled closely after Jerry Orbach's in the original, a smattering of social history, and a hip-swinging soundtrack.  I doubt this movie will soar to the pop-culture heights of the original: the soundtrack is lighter and the dialogue can't have much impact until it, too, has survived a thousand airings on VH1.<br />What intrigues is the change of focus.  \\"Dirty Dancing\\" was about a girl raised on ballroom dancing who wanted to get sensual.  \\"Havana Nights\\" is about a dirty dancing boy who wants to learn ballroom.  If, in five years, ballroom dancing has reclaimed the pop culture, we will be able to thank \\"Havana Nights\\", and Patrick Swayze will once again be at the center of it all.
B000068IEU|4.0|Wes Craven's debut is the perfect example of the kind of horror film that comes under fire for violence.  It's a million miles away from Craven's Music Of The Heart or Scream, and probably won't appeal to the Craven \\"fans\\" who like those films.  What you've heard is true:  This is a brutal and relentless film.  It was made in that glorious age of cinema where you could get away with making a film like this.  Sure, it had it censors, but nothing like the strict rules that govern the film industry today. This was the only horror film my mother forbade me to watch as a kid.  Naturally this aroused my interest even more, and I finally got around to it as a teenager.  It's extremely basic:  Two teenage girls are kidnapped by a gang of loons, tortured, beaten, humiliated, raped and killed.  This is the first 50 minutes of the film!  The last act has the parents of one victim getting their bloody revenge, and you'll be cheering them on every second of the way.  The leader of the gang is none other than the creepiest sleazeball in cinematic history, David Hess(no offense, David, I love you).  If you want to make a film with a menacing, evil looking brute who beats women, there is absolutely no one better than David Hess.  He's the kind of actor you might just not want to meet in reality.  Hard to believe this guy wrote two hit singles for Elvis Presley!!!  Like I said, the film is crude, violent, depressing, and has some odd attempts at humor and a bizarre choice of songs for certain scenes(courtesy of, you guessed it, David Hess!).  It's totally uncalled for and there's really no way to defend it.  Just like the commercial: \\"Why do you like them?  They don't taste like apples.\\"  \\"We just do.\\"  If there is any message to be found in this film at all it's this:  It may actually open your eyes-if you live a sheltered life-to the fact that these atrocious, vile things are real.  The film's not a true story in the literal sense, but all too true if you know what I mean.
B00003CXBK|5.0|this movie is really one of the best i have seen in a long time maybe even one of the best movies i have ever seen the plotline hooks you in from the very beggining and doesnt let you go until the movie ends the charecters are great and the dubbing is suprisingly good for once well anyway i love this movie go buy it now do u hear me buy now go and spend hours watching it<br />ohhhhhh ya and i wone forget this is not a little kids movie there is some bloody violence but nothing too horrible like samurai x but anyway great movie go buy now

0440241413|5.0|And so, as I was opening up my birthday presents this year, I found a wonderful set of books.  The shopaholics.  &quot;Because you like to shop, Sakura*&quot; my friends had sad.  And I started reading, and reading, AND READING.  Homework was on hold and I spent the day reading this book of pure genius.  I loved it.  Becky Bloomwood is funny and quirky.  Despite her maxxed out credit cards and constant naive choices, Becky is intelligent, which makes this story all the more appealing.  I can't stand it when women are portrayed as bubble-headed people who can't stand on their own two feet.  But Becky is not one of those people.  And I love Kinsella for not making her like that.  Happy Reading folks.  Enjoy!

B00005JG6S|5.0|Known as the breakthrough anime film that helped the genre reach transpacific shores, and a film that broke Japan's box office records, beating out Return Of The Jedi, Akira spawned many series inspired by it, many of them taking place in nihilstic post-nuclear settings or characters named Tetsuo.<br />The nihilism of Neo-Tokyo in 2019 is a place wracked by civil disobedience, anti-government terrorists, political paralysis and corruption among the ruling Supreme Council, police crackdown on political dissidents, members of a doomsday cult calling for a purification by fire, and the youth biker gangs consisting of alienated youths.<br />Tetsuo is a not so significant member of such a gang, only visible because of his friendship with Kaneda, a youth who has sort of been an older brother to him, always helping him out of scrapes and coming to his rescue.  In chasing and beating up members of a rival group of bikers called the Clowns, so-called because of the masks they wear, Tetsuo has an accident and a run-in with a tiny wizened creature, who it turns out is one of three children with psy powers.  Tetsuo is taken to a secret hospital, where he is experimented on by the scientists there.  He breaks free though, his latent psychic powers awakened by his encounter with the child.<br />The chief government scientist is simultaneously intrigued and fearful of the powerful potential within Tetsuo.  &quot;Maybe we shouldn't touch that power-the power of God.  But we have to.  We have to touch it and control it.&quot;  However, the colonel, a stern military figure who is more cautious and is protective for the safety of the three psy-powered children, warns the scientist not to be reckless and to have Tetsuo killed if he can't be controlled.  The colonel seems to be the only capable government official portrayed.  He wants stability and he isn't too crazy about what neo-Tokyo is, but he wants to be able to control things without them getting out of hand instead of the politicians in the Council who only bicker among themselves on dwindling budget funds and are only in it to remain in power.<br />However, there is an underlying resentment and anger within Tetsuo, not only because he is a disaffected youth, but he has been bullied, with Kaneda always coming to his rescue, and that itself turns into resentment against his benefactor.  But there's also an underlying wish to be somebody, marked by the scene where he is poked fun of when he is sitting on Kaneda's powerful red motorbike, whose futuristic design is another hallmark of the movie.  And the pent-up rage and frustration has very destructive repercussions.  Kaneda himself becomes involved with Kei, a female revolutionary whom he manages to save twice and thus thinks they should have a connection.<br />Many of the themes that pop up in anime come out here.  The opening scene of a brilliant white globe of light engulfing Tokyo in 1988 is a reminder that Japan was the only nation that had an atomic bomb dropped on it.  And the rebuilt Yoyogi Stadium, where the 2020 Olympics is to be held in the movie, is a reminder of the 1964 Tokyo Olympics and the stadium, symbolizing the renewed Japan that rose from the ashes of WW2.<br />The devastating scenes of destruction, particularly the havoc wreaked upon neo-Tokyo accomplishes much that a live action film couldn't, but it's the hallucinatory sequences involving giant teddy bears bleeding milk and Tetsuo's final transformation into a hideous pulsating being that are the visual highlights of the film, which can either repulse or fascinate the viewer.<br />Series like Speed Racer, Tetsuan Atomu (Astro Boy), and Kimba the White Lion may have led the pack in the early days of anime, but Akira was the one that pushed the anime genre into full prominence.cians in the Council who only bicker among themselves on dwindling budget funds and are only in it to remain in power.<br />However, there is an underlying resentment and anger within Tetsuo, not only because he is a disaffected youth, but he has been bullied, with Kaneda always coming to his rescue, and that itself turns into resentment against his benefactor.

B000002AZ8|4.0|I've not very much to add to the other reviews but one thing: The dramatically underrated song &quot;Aye Davanita&quot; is to me the highlight of the CD. It is not &quot;easy&quot; to listen, and it seems to be nothing more than some boring loops with no melody at first hearing. But close your eyes, and listen to all the details and superb guitar details, and you will hear the quality of this song.
B000002UB3|5.0|When Abbey Road was released on vinyl, they had actually recorded the sound of an LP at the end of the track, just click, click, clicking as if there was nothing more on the album. Quite appropriate, since the previous song was titled &quot;The End&quot;. (And, I seem to recall that &quot;Her Majesty&quot; wasn't originally listed on the back of the album)<br />Personally, I feel that &quot;Her Majesty&quot; didn't belong anywhere else BUT at the end. It gave the impression of being an &quot;afterthought&quot; - as if it were added to the end in memory of the late Paul McCartney, who had died in a car accident.
0440237688|5.0|A wonderful book! I recommend it to everyone. Any age!
B00018D44U|4.0|I love Norah and I was crazily expecting her new release. I think it is a solid CD, but nothing spectacular. Her wording sounds more mature, but it is ultimately a safe CD that does not really take her into any bold new direction. I must say that Norah gave up some of her jazz to incorporate an uncanny country sound. I don't like country and even though her sultry voice makes the album more enjoyable to me, the last person I expected to find as a duet partnet was DOLLY PARTON!!!!!!!!!! In any case, original Norah fans like me will probably enjoy the CD, but I will definitely wait for a new collection that rescues her from country and takes her back to that romantic night sound of her original CD.
0385504209|1.0|Did you ever wonder what happened to those young crime fighters when they grew up? Now you know. A murder brings together Sophie the 30+ cryptographer and Robert the 40+ historian forcing them to answer a series of riddles and puzzles in order to solve the caper. The puzzles have all the sophistication of writing in lemon juice and reading messages in the mirror. Can you think of a five letter word associated with Sir Isaac Newton? If not then you will be left spell bound by cryptic hints like \\"we could use some fruit from the tree of knowledge to solve this one!\\" Except for the occasional references to sex to remind you this is adult fiction, this is the Hardy Boys all over again.
B00000IN5G|5.0|being the owner of follow the reaper and hate crew deathroll (still need something wild, although im sure that's amazing as well) i had high expectations for hatebreeder. children of bodom has always dazzled me with the amazingly fast and complex solos that alexi shreds through, not to mention the dual keyboards and guitar work they have going on. and i must say that hatebreeder, while the rest of the albums come close, is by far my favorite children of bodom cd. <br />every single song is so layered with crazy drum work, bass lines that you can actually hear, and guitar work that puts a lot of death metal to shame, and the keyboards just add to such an atmospheric recording that CoB are almost untouchable. alexi, while he isn't the greatest vocalist in death metal, you have to give him credit for ripping through his manic solos while screaming his lungs out, which very few can do and still sound good.<br />there isnt a bad song on this cd. newcomers to CoB might be caught off gaurd, so be warned...CoB AREN'T trying to be as evil as possible and a lot of their songs seem to have an upbeat flow to them. so if youre expecting something from nile or someone, you may be disapointed, AT FIRST. CoB definetely takes awhile to get used to, so give the cd a few listens before you make your decision on it. hatebreeder, as well as all other CoB albums, just grow on you the more you listen to them.<br />and sure, they may not be the best at pronouncing english, but where is it EVER written that all bands need to speak ENGLISH fluently? or english AT ALL? stop complaining and just enjoy the music. definetely an essential to any metal fan's collection.<br />the.pink.frenchman.
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game is no doubt well written by a science fiction stand point.  However, the author does a great job going beyond your cliche space combat.  Card explores the human mind, exploiting the depths of humanity's motives and emotion.  While it is true that the genius, Ender, is no ordinary human, Card portrays the mutual characteristics that we all share.  It is also through Ender's journeys that Card addresses philosophical views about right and wrong, life and death, good and evil.  In young Wiggin's mind is an epic tale of moral conflict that all of us experience on a lesser scale throughout our lives.  Also very interesting are the tales of his siblings on Earth, as they coax Earthlings into becoming reliant upon the political reasoning their characters supply.  Obviously, Ender's Game is not only for the sci-fi buffs, but also for those interested in reading a intriguing work of genius and losing themselves in thought.
B00006F83Y|5.0|Their self-titled album was great, the second album (Rated R) is awesome too, but this album tops everything, and sets a standard of greatness for all other albums I will ever listen in the future. Homme, the guitarist and lead singer (well for most of the album), is the heart and soul of this band, as he brings all of his other projects to new and higher levels, he does the same with QOTSA. Oliveri, the bassist and the singer on one or two tracks, brings the hardcore feel to this album, his vocals are gritty and they hit you hard, and his bass playing is pretty good too. Grohl, the guest drummer for this album, well hes a freaking bad ass as a drummer, hes alright at everything else, but he is an awesome drummer. Lanegan, the singer on a few tracks, his smooth, subtle, sometimes gritty vocals, compliment the awesome guitar bass and drums on this album. All this really turned me to alot of Josh Homme's work, and its all really good stuff with the same idea. That idea, to revolutionize/change the world of rock with every release. To have something new with everything he does. And its a very refreshing thing to listen to.
6305127646|5.0|I am a long time fan of Charteris' early Saint stories and I'm very happy with this film. It's set in modern times, but works fairly well as an origin story for the Saint. The Saint was at his best in the early days when he was a closest to his criminal past, but later stories, radio shows, and TV shows glossed over the fact that he was a criminal and made him out to be just a adventure seeking playboy. The Saint lost his edge. What a shame!The early pulp adventures were much more interesting. I liked Roger Moore as the Saint, but wished he'd played the early and more devilish incarnation of the character. Val Kilmer's version of the character is both a modern version and a return to the Saint's criminal and pulp roots. As a long time Saint fan I find this to be most excellent!
B00018D3RI|5.0|If you are a true Starsky and Hutch fan as I, you'll appreciate all the effort put forth in these DVD's. The quality is excellent, the restoration near perfect, there are a few clitches here and there but nothing that takes away from the episodes whatsoever.<BR>  All the episodes that I have watched so far are uncut. Savage Sunday will be the true test if the extra footage is in there or not.<BR>  The extra interviews are just the ticket given by Paul Glaser, David Soul and Antonio Fargus's insight/hindsight on the series, along with William Blinn and Aaron Spelling giving lengthy views on the development of the series and what in their opinions made the series such a success. Also to top things off, is an owner of one of the orginal show cars with a really detailed look at the car and what made it make such a lasting impression. (Makes me appreciate my 76 S&amp;H Torino even more!)<BR>  I can only hope that the rest of the series 2, 3 and 4 are also released subsequently with the same attention to quality as these were, buy and enjoy!
B000002534|4.0|this 1974 album is a partial return to rock and dance-oriented music for Carlos Santana and his group, right at the culmination of his most experimental and virtuosic period. Contrast Borboletta with the avant-fusion Alice Coltrane-Santana [[ASIN:B000006ZUV Illuminations]] album released the same year.    Taking its title from an Airto Moreira composition, Borboletta continues the previous two [Caravanserai, and [[ASIN:B0012GMV58 Welcome]] - see my review] studio albums' format of instrumental-only and vocal tracks, flowing into each other. The soulful voice of Leon Patillo here replaces jazz singer Leon Thomas of Santana's 1973 band. Tom Coster's keyboard arrangements remain a primary element, tenor/soprano saxophonist Jules Broussard (heard on the Welcome and Illuminations albums) also contributes, as do Flora Purim and Airto (each heard on Welcome). Stanley Clarke is a dazzling featured guest on bass, and the expert, passionate trap drumkit playing of Michael Shrieve still underpins most of the groove. Shrieve relinquishes the drum throne to Ndugu Leon Chancler for 'Aspirations' & 'Here And Now', and to Airto for 'Flor De Canela' & 'Promise Of A Fisherman'. Carlos himself contributes percussion on 'Canto De Los Flores', 'Practice What You Preach', 'Here And Now' and gong (!) on 'Mirage'.    Ethereal, spiritual jazz-fusion flourishes are here, as on preceding albums - e.g. the intros to 'Life Is Anew' or 'Flor De Canela' - but each track places greater musical emphasis on Afro-Brazilian funk/percussion jams (\\"Chepito\\" Areas and Armando Peraza really shine) than on the open-ended improvisations of Santana's 1973 band. This album begins and ends with brief, atmospheric Airto/Flora percussion and vocal features. 'Practice What You Preach' has a gospelly intro with universalist lyrics of Sri Chinmoy disciples, and the lyrics to 'Mirage' echo this meditative metaphor. The great samba composer Dorival Caymmi's 'Promise Of A Fisherman' is presented as a seamless continuation of the 'Flor De Canela' jam, with Santana soloing over a beautiful, gentle vocal/keyboard backdrop at the outset, into gradually layered intensity of guitar, keyboards and percussion.    In some ways the concept and programme of Borboletta - jazzy/spiritual but with a rock/funk/soul/percussion backbone - seems a precursor to his wonderful 1979 album [[ASIN:B000007VCO Oneness: Silver Dreams Golden Reality]]. Borboletta is perhaps not as high an improvisational or inspirational peak as Illuminations, Welcome, or [[ASIN:B0000027D5 Lotus]] - but it's still Santana at creative altitude.

They only live to get married, that's their only goal, their only horizon. I felt so happy to find a movie that strikes people in their heads and tells them there's so much more to life. People don't need a couple to be happy. Happiness comes from within... Awesome movie. You'll fall in love with the characters and a smile will be drawn in your face as you watch it.

Young Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) teams up with Jedi veteran Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) and the mercenary Han Solo (Harrison Ford) to rescue the gorgeous Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) from the sinister clutches of Darth Vader and the evil empire.<br />High space adventure, with creatures like Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and the delightful R2-D2  (Kenny Baker).<br />With the final Star Wars (but will it be the final?) set for release later this year , the original trilogy is a great buy to refresh your memory.<br /><br />A momentous battle between good and evil. With the empire perhaps at the time representing the evil Soviet Empire, which the free world was then fighting against for freedom in 1977. It has that wonderful 1970's feel, and who would not want to rescue the sexy huggable Princess Leia, even if it means battling the goons of the empire and the horrific Darth Vader?
B00018D3RI|4.0|Now that I've had a chance to watch all these again after SO many years, I've realized a few things: the show was funny (but not funny enough to warrant the theatrical version being a full-on comedy), there was a great camaraderie between the two guys, the plots were shallow, to solve a crime they always relied on &quot;tips&quot; from the types of people they should have been arresting as well, and the Torino was not seen as often as it should have been.<BR>For me, it was all about the car, and during this first season I calculate that it is only seen for about 35% of the total time. I'm referring to everything from seeing it just parked to being in hot pursuit. There is one episode where it is not even present at all! I could have sworn it was used much more than that, but it's been a long time.<BR>The storylines are not incredibly engaging, but they are fairly entertaining and the occasional bits of cornball humor keep it interesting. It is a shame that there was no real detective work going on, as the plots were easily resolved because all they needed to do was find some pimp or hooker who knew someone who knew the killer, and then it was over. A little too easy for me.<BR>One cool point is that the shows were from back in the day when commercials weren't so damn intrusive, and episodes are 50 minutes each compared to today's 40+ minute scripts.<BR>The extras are nice, but there aren't that many. The best being, of course, (IMHO) &quot;The Third Star&quot; which is a little snippet on the Torino. Judging by the first season and the Torino's lack of appearance, it seems that the &quot;car as star&quot; concept didn't really kick in until later on. The pilot episode bears the best use of the car out of all of them, and contains the scenes which make up the opening credits for the rest of the series.<BR>Not as cerebral as NYPD Blue and its kin, but tons more fun, Starsky and Hutch is perhaps the definitive show of the 70s.

Young Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) teams up with Jedi veteran Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) and the mercenary Han Solo (Harrison Ford) to rescue the gorgeous Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) from the sinister clutches of Darth Vader and the evil empire.<BR>High space adventure, with creatures like Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and the delightful R2-D2  (Kenny Baker). <BR>With the final Star Wars (but will it be the final?) set for release later this year , the original trilogy is a great buy to refresh your memory.<br />A momentous battle between good and evil. With the empire perhaps at the time representing the evil Soviet Empire, which the free world was then fighting against for freedom in 1977. It has that wonderful 1970s feel, and who would not want to rescue the sexy huggable Princess Leia. <BR>In my opinion this great original one is the best of the lot.
B000002KKC|5.0|Yeah, I was at GoodWill and I found the Vinyl Record One of Tusk for $1.00; its fantastic!  I wish I could find Record Two somewhere though..  I might go out and buy the cd.  This band has always amazed me.
B000000WF0|4.0|After a brief leave of absence, The Verve reintroduced themselves in 1997 more self-assured, grounded, and focused. 'Urban Hymns' is quite a departure from their earlier swirly spacerock meets psychedelia sound...flying through clouds has now turned into a much more grounded and personal affair. The mood is set with the orchestral opener 'Bittersweet Symphony'. A calling card convincing listeners that the atmospheric veil has been lifted, revealing intimate, carefully crafted, wonderfully produced songs. Along with the introduction of symphonic strings/instruments, Richard Ashcroft's lyrics are deeply personal, as guitarist Nick McCabe straddles between his trademark echoing guitar whines, bluesy plucking and meandering funk riffs. McCabe's guitarwork continues to have this surreal quality, yet less dense and more delicate, a perfect compliment to the undercurrent of emotion and colorful orchestral splashes. One might argue that 'Urban Hymns' paved the way for emotional/brooding-type bands like Travis and Coldplay, a tribute to this stellar swansong, tapping into universal emotions of what it means to be human. The Verve's break-up may have been bittersweet, but their musical legacy may be sweeter than it is bitter, as it is better to leave ontop than as it is to fade away.
B000089RVX|5.0|The song &quot;Missing&quot; is not on this album, and if anyone tries to download it on KaZaA they'll get a version of it that has stupid sounds in it, so finding a clean version of the song is an EXTREMELY RARE find. But...hehe, I have it, well, actually I have the song in 2 versions, both perfect. If anyone wants it, add me to your MSN messenger, my address is mansonchyld@hotmail.com.<BR>As per this album...Amy Lee has a magnificent voice, and all of these songs are great, I do prefer the &quot;Origin&quot; versions a bit more, as they are more raw, but these ones are good as well. Good job Evanescence. And fans of the song &quot;Missing&quot;, read the above, it's all true.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|What is going on with you people?  One star reviews for one of the most resonate motion pictures of the year???  This movie contains the most real acting I've seen in 2003 outside of 21 Grams.  The atmosphere is beautifully layered with elements of thoughtful speculation, light humor, the neon glaze of Tokyo, and a very deep melancholy.  I cannot understand how anyone with an interest in people and relationships can dislike this movie!  If you were expecting a typical Bill Murray flick and didn't get that, blame the product placements and ads, not an amazing and unique movie such as this.  &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; was never intended to be mainstream, but after such critical acclaim and Bill Murray in the title role it had no other choice.  I can understand some people who expected pure comedy being dissapointed, but how can anyone not be delighted with a movie as real and hearfelt as this?  Bill Murray and Scarlett Johanson are complex and endearing characters.  The direction is perfectly subtle as it allows us to simply watch these two interact with each other and the environment around them, slowly building a relationship beyond what they can understand.  There is humor, but it plays a supporting role, as it does in life.  So lets set the record straight--do not buy or rent this movie if all you want is the typical Bill Murray fare, because you WILL NOT get it.  What you will get is a film of great atmosphere and depth, with wonderful performances, and very real emotions.  It is a subtle film, but a great one.  Try to watch it without expectations, and give the film its due attention.<br />P.S. The long conversation scene in the hotel room at night is an amazing feat of acting and direction.
B00005QXXO|4.0|This CD is very good, but as has been stated before, there are many versions of these songs online that are better.  To their credit, the versions of I Might be Wrong, the National Anthem and Like Spinning Plates are great, and for many new fans this version of LSP is the first time they've heard it done by Thom on the piano.  <br />However, the version of True Love Waits, beautiful as it is, is nothing compared to the first version played in 1995.  The original featured a keyboard loop near the end of the song that seemed out of place, yet just... worked.<br />In the end, however, the raw energy of the National Anthem, I Might Be Wrong and Idioteque, the laid-back Dollars and Cents, the inferior version of True Love Waits, the beautiful acoustic Like Spinning Plates, the bleh Morning Bell (the only Radiohead song I dislike), and the 2003-2004 tour closer and ambient masterpiece Everything in its Right Place make this a great choice for any Radiohead fan.<br />To truly capture the feeling that Radiohead should leave you with, you must see them live, though.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I thought this album was amazing-- there isnt a song that i say i did not enjoy on it-- her timing when she sings is one of a kind and it is amazing. I love the smoky and soulful twing to her voice and needless to say, her band and songwriters are nothing short of genious. The hype is the truth.
0385504209|1.0|With the promise of a thriller complete with secret societies and cold-blooded murders, and a subject matter of no less than Christianity and the Church, the book is intriguing.  Indeed it is rich in &quot;historical&quot; tid bits and art symbolism, all suggesting a different way of looking at Christianity and the Divine.  I am not an expert in art or symbolism, and I read Brown's presuppositions with interest (albeit not without serious questions on some).  Likewise the puzzles (cryptex) are fascinating.  His religious assertions, however, are off the wall.  I agree that throughout the history of the Church, the feminine aspect of the Divine has been suppressed.  But Brown's suggestion that this is embodied in Mary Magdalene (if such a person in fact ever existed), perpetuated by a cult that has to be kept in secrecy for ages is not logical.  There are other points: such as his theory about the bloodline of Jesus (why France?), Mary instead of John at the Last Supper, Mary Magdalene as the Holy Grail, even the symbolism in Disney's Lion King (a real long stretch) -- all thrown together to make a good story.<br />And yet the story sinks. The plot is convoluted, and full of illogical inconsistencies.  Right from the start with the murder of the curator of the Louvre: he and the other keepers of the secret were killed after they supposedly told the murderer the secret.  But knowing that these are the highest members of a secret society sworn to keep the secret to death, how could the murderer be so naive as not to suspect that what they told him might not be the truth? (so that killing them would completely close the possibility of finding the true secret). If the curator was able to arrange a very complex sign before he died to pass on the secret to his granddaughter, why didn't he add the name of the murderer for the police (who were not interested in solving the secret)? The two investigations were separate.  But of course if he did, the police would have no reasons to chase the two scientists. The chase started in the middle of the night and involved interrogations, solving complex puzzles, escaping the police, driving all around Paris, two long stops, being driven to the countryside and then to Versailles, a very long discussion on the holy grail, a murder attempt, and yet by the time the police closed in it was still dark? And so on and so forth; illogical actions (like having barely escaped the murder attempt, why bring the murderer along to England?) just to support a twist in the story.<br />One can certainly read the book as entertainment and enjoy the ride.  But it is a bumpy ride if one reads it with a critical mind.  Historical &quot;facts&quot;? Art history? Brown is yet to convince me.ns to chase the two scientists.

B00005NNMJ|5.0|This is one great cd. From the moment the title track blasts through your speakers like a cannonball it is clear this is a great album.The other songs are great too featuring irresitible riffs and vocals all very pleasing to hear and Winter Dreams is great.
1556154844|5.0|If you are a programmer, get this book ASAP!  This will make you a better programmer and give you guidence for continual improvement.

B000000WCV|4.0|Daft Punk's debut Homework, is without a doubt one of the most essential albums to own in the genre of Electronica. It has undisputedly revolutionized House music and is considered one of the most influential recordings in the Techno world. The two singles here (Around The World and Da Funk) are responsible for epitomizing dance music for the mainstream audience. <br />Daftendirekt - 8/10   A rather strong beginning. Decent samples and beats. Leads directly into the next track. <BR>WDPK 83.7 FM - 6/10   Extremely short. Not much purpose since \\"Daftendirekt\\" already serves as an intro. <BR>Revolution 909 - 9/10   One of the most solid tracks in this disc. Simple, straight forward, yet effective. Genuine dance music with an emphatic base beat. <BR>Da Funk - 10/10   This song is simply ground breaking, the peak of Homework's success. Perfect acid drops juxtaposed against an ingenious rhythm. Unquestionably Daft Punk at its best.<BR>Phoenix - 9/10   The beats are absolutely intoxicating. The audience will be utterly lost in the enchanting baseline. One of the highlights of Homework.<BR>Fresh - 6/10   Average. The sound of water falls tends to get a bit tedious over time.<BR>Around The World - 10/10   The second best song on Homework. Length is a little long, a few conversions would have made it much better. Still, an unforgettable masterpiece.<BR>Rollin' & Scratchin' - 3/10   Loud, overly repetitive, obnoxious.<BR>Teachers - 8/10   Just as innovative and inspirational Daft Punk is considered to up and coming DJs, the guys pay tribute here to the pioneers before them. Very original, amusing, and done in good taste.<BR>High Fidelity - 7/10  Average. A fair effort.   <BR>Rock `N Roll - 2/10   The lowest point on this disc. Incredibly abrasive. Complete filler. Skip.<BR>Oh Yeah - 4/10   Mediocre at best.<BR>Burnin' - 5/10   Satisfactory. Barely acceptable.<BR>Indo Silver Club - 9/10   One of Daft Punk's most underrated songs. Bouncy beats with club atmosphere, just as the title suggests. <BR>Alive - 6/10   This track is reminiscent of an Adrian Sherwood (A sound engineer for Nine Inch Nails) remix. Boring, lacks progression and variety. <BR>Funk Ad - 7/10   This should have been looped to the end of \\"Da Funk\\" with a intuitive transition. Combining both elements here would have helped catapult the song into new heights.<br />An important thing to keep in mind is that Daft Punk's Homework consists of a good group of songs which are immediately appealing. They tend to build up to a climax where the least bit of detail, transition, or alteration would have produced immense improvement. However, despite the above statement, do not be fooled of the quality of this cd. <br />For those whom dare to enter the world of House music, your Homework starts here.<br />- ToS.
B00003CXAA|5.0|I'd like to say that the Godfather films are all great. The first two have been reocognized on over 500 top 100 movies lists, and even the third one was great. I dont't know why everyone hated the third. Was it Sofia Coppala's acting? Was it Anday Garcia's annoying character? I don't know. You have to admit that the last scene with Al Pacino dying is a classic. And even the plot premise wasn't bad at all.
B00003CXIP|5.0|stand by me is 1 of the best movies of all time. i fell in love with it the 1st time i saw it. the 4 characters chris(river phoenix) gordie(will wheaton) vern(jerry o'connelle) and teddy(corey feldman) really showed how strong a friendship can really be. the comedy in the movie is so good, and i think everyone can relate to chris, gordie, vern, or teddy.i'm 1 of those people who have a few favorite movies and watch them nonstop. for me stand by me is one of those movies. not only do you laugh, but you even cry too. river phoenix did an amazing job, and will be missed.i recomend this movie to anyone who loves a good old classic. they just dont make them like this anymore.
B00005B36H|3.0|Tool has capabilities and talents that most bands in their genre can only dream of having.  They can take a 10-minute+ song and hold a listener's attention for its entirety.  They all have musical talent that surpasses most, if not all, mainstream artists, especially Danny Carrey (listen to \\"Forty-Six and 2\\" from Aenima if you don't believe me).  Musically, Lateralus is attention-getting and fascinating for the most part (minus the last three tracks, which meander on and on).  They do lack any good solos or fills that previous albums have had, but their music is still tight.  However, what the heck happened to their lyrics?  Did Keenan decide that he no longer cared?<br />  On Aenima, their lyrics were so genius, because they sent strong messages that contradicted what most people wanted you to believe about certain subjects.  Take \\"Eulogy\\" for example; Keenan basically ridicules Chrisianity when he tell the supposed \\"martyr\\" to jump off his cross, so they can \\"nail the next fool martyr\\".  In other words, he seems to imply that Jesus Christ never died for a real cause.  Now, I'm a Catholic myself, and I don't believe what he says.  However, seeing how many Catholics and Christians there are, what he said was a gutsy move, and I respected him for having the courage to state his opinion like that.  In  \\"Hooker with a Penis\\", he ridicules the music industry, saying that it's all about the money (which it is).  However, in Lateralus, these interesting lyrical contents are gone.  Take the title track for instance; the opening lyrics are nothing more than a metaphor for maturity; big deal!  How many times have we heard that theme played over and over again?  Then, in the third or so stanza, he says, \\"Over thinking, over analyzing separates the body from the mind.\\"  .....DUH!!!!  Does anyone else see the obviousness in that statement, or is it just me?  Minds are capable of thought, and bodies are not.  Yes Keenan, I knew that too!  The rest of the track is full of this crap, so let's move on.  The only other track with any sort of supposed lyrical content is \\"Schism\\".  Here, he meanders on and on about communication between lovers, and how the pieces of the puzzle used to fit, but no longer do.  Again, another lame metaphor that has been overplayed.  In short, my biggest problem with this disk is that lyrically, Tool tackles issues that don't show their unique views, as they did in Aenima.  Rather, they get overly tongue-tied in cliches that have been heard and discussed for many centuries now.  And, in a disc where much of the music goes on for awhile, a lyrical moment/climax is crucial.  However, this isn't a horrible effort musically, and, like I said before, most bands could only hope to achieve the musicallity that Tool can  easily master on their worst day.
B000002JSJ|5.0|For some reason, Led Zeppelin's 1976 album, &quot;Presence,&quot; is not as highly touted as the band's earlier work. Yes, the band recorded it in a mere month, and yes, Robert Plant's voice, while commanding as usual, sounds a *little* restrained here, as he recorded his vocals sitting down with his leg in a cast, as he was still recovering from a car accident. But these are mere trifles, as &quot;Presence&quot; really is an awesome Zeppelin album, a full-throttle rocker from beginning to end. The band ride shotgun on the galloping 10 1/2 minute epic, &quot;Achilles Last Stand,&quot; an all-time Zeppelin classic. &quot;For Your Life&quot; is funky with a capital F, and &quot;Royal Orleans&quot; is a cool little ditty. &quot;Nobody's Fault But Mine&quot; is another signature Zeppelin rocker, &quot;Candy Store Rock&quot; and &quot;Hots On For Nowhere&quot; are both excellent, and the band's sultry 9 1/2 minute blues number &quot;Tea For One&quot; is a real beauty. Robert Plant's pipes still pack a punch, Jimmy Page totally cuts loose with one killer guitar riff after another, John Paul Jones bravely puts aside his keyboards for this album and strictly lets his thunderous bass do the talking, and, of course, what needs to be said about late drummer John Bonham---the guy was simply a monster on that drumkit. First-rate production by Page, outstanding performances by the band, and, to put it simply, the album just plain rocks. No doubt in my mind---&quot;Presence&quot; is yet another Led Zeppelin classic.
B0000026T4|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums although I am not a big fan of Alice. It's got some great songs like &quot;Posion&quot; and &quot;Hell Is Living Without You&quot;. I recommend this one!
0385510438|1.0|A thriller should thrill. This book is so besotted with its politically correct agenda that it forgets to entertain and is a great yawn instead. First, a disclaimer: this is the first time that I've ever bought a new Grisham (based on a good review I read) and thought that I might happily rest my mind with a few hours of diversion. Unfortunately, the first murder after the opening event does not take place for almost 200 pages. In the mean time we are subjected to endless blather on race relations in the South of the 1970s, the Viet Nam war, the death penalty, and Richard Nixon. Grisham's views on all of the above are just as predictable as the novel's ending. His characters are either so perfect or so villainous that the stereotyping becomes quite grating. All the &quot;action&quot; takes place in the last 40 pages; the solution is completely predictable and as unsatisfying as anything else you will find here including the bite-sized sentences and paragraphs. I won't make this mistake again.

0385508417|3.0|Not wanting to waste a promising two-week vacation, I decided to read a Christmas book - but one can only read The Best Christmas Pageant Ever so many times! Skipping Christmas, a satiric novella about society's obsession with the season, proved a good remedy for boredom. Grisham departs from the action and drama of his legal thrillers by focusing on one couple's plan to forego the holiday trivialities. After spending an overwhelming $6,100 the previous year, the Kranks decide that their money would be better utilized on a Caribbean cruise vacation, especially since their beloved daughter will not be home this season. Fellow residents of Hemlock Street criticize the Kranks for their lack of spirit, and the couple finds themselves under increasing pressure to conform - \\"skipping\\" Christmas seems easier said than done. Then, the unexpected happens, and the neighborhood unites in discovering the true meaning of Christmas. Grisham's tight-knit community exposes a valid point about holiday commercialism by creating a humorous yet shocking picture of society's often overly materialistic outlook on life. Despite the Kranks' overboard scheme and the unrealistic reactions from some of their neighbors, I enjoyed the novella and recommend this book as a just-for-fun read... for those who happen to have some free time around Christmas.
B000053VAZ|4.0|I thought it was a great movie. It really makes you put Johnny Depp in different light. Unlike Once Upon a Time in Mexico and Pirates of the Caribbean, it is very cute and easy to enjoy. I have showed it to about 7 people (friends and family) and we had a good laugh. I highly recommend it for all people.
B00011V8CW|5.0|This album is a great jazz/techno album that'll have you groovin along with Bowie. I'm glad it's back in print! Now I can enjoy the souns of this remastered album to its entirety.
B000002J09|5.0|Having already read about half the reviews for this album, it makes me wonder why anybody would give a bad review for it. But then I finally got the joke, there not really giving it a bad review there just trying to be funny. <BR>The fact that every note, every lyric, everything is perfect. That's why this remains the best album of hard rock to this day. The first two albums I and II are the best, even Physical Graffiti remains a staple in rock history. House of the Holy has a great arrangement of songs, but some how III remains people's personal favorite. This is the essential Led Zeppelin Album, and for people just jumping on to the bandwagon, this would be the one to buy.
B000089RVX|1.0|what is the big deal about this band.. is it because they have a female singer with a horribly annoying voice remenscent of nails on a chalk board?...or is it the crummy recycled power chord guitar riffs?.. please.. this band is a joke.. they are only popular due to the fact they play mainstreanm rock music with a female vocalist, don't be fooled
0930289234|5.0|Reading the other reviews  of &quot;Watchmen&quot; by Alan Moore, I wonder if there's any stone left unturned, whether any praises have yet to be extolled for this awesome collection. Still, I obsessively post this review because I feel almost required as a comic book fan to say how great Watchmen is.<br />&quot;Watchmen&quot; focuses on a world which is one step away from nuclear warfare between America and a vague Soviet threat. Takes place almost entirely in New York City which is functionally drawn by Dave Gibbons. The art is different from a comparable story like &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; which has a similar setting and plot. While Dark Knight uses painted art, Watchmen has the four colors scheme which many people are familiar with, I think that the art never holds the story back, but it also never really elevates Moore's story to another level. Functional.<br />There are a lot of colorful characters;  I like Rorschach most, whenever he wasn't on the page, I would wonder what he was doing. Rorschach is actually one of the last masked adventurers left, because the government has prohibited vigilante activity. At first, Rorschach is the sole protagonist of the story, but others are pretty rapidly revealed to the reader, from the blue bodied Dr. Manhattan to the Smartest Man in the World, Adrian Veidt.<br />I really liked to find out more and more about these people, and whenever Moore chooses to elaborate on a character's personality or origins, it's usually pertinent to the greater plot.<br />Plotwise, &quot;Watchmen&quot; is remarkable. Although it looks pretty long this is an extremely tight collection, it moves well towards the ending, which is mind blowing.<br />I would reccomend &quot;Watchmen&quot; to mature people in general, it's appeal reaches beyond the cognoscenti of the comic book world, I had only read &quot;Preacher&quot; and &quot;Dark Knight Returns&quot; before reading Watchmen at first, and I loved Watchmen. However, it's pretty bloody, although not even nearly as bloody as a comic like Preacher, and it's somewhat profane although also not on the level of Preacher. It's probably like a 4 on the violence meter and 2 on the profanity meter, if Preacher was a 10.<br />A good reason to buy this, as opposed to read this in the store, is that it's pretty long. I guess that someone could feasibly complete Watchmen in one sitting, but it took me a few hours to do, and I think it would have really detracted from my overall experience to rush it. Also this is a pretty serious graphic novel, it has lots of nice layers and it's the type of thing that I imagine most people will read a few times.

Josh's soaring, crystalline voice echos with haunting passion.<br />#8 &quot;Broken Vow&quot; reaches into one's secrets and is deeply moving.<br />#10 &quot;Remember when it rained&quot; is an unbearably beautiful song. His voice is gentle and soothing yet majestic and inspiring in his styling of this song.

I love the celtic sound with the wailing violins and suspended strings. The gorgeous and powerful orchestration supports this superb artist's perfect voice.

It is a magical experience to watch such a beautiful young man sing like an angel in four languages as he does on this exqusite CD.

If you actually finish this novel, then I know you'll understand me completely when I say that it feels like I've vanquished a huge accomplishment of a beast. I loved it,  but it does get tedious in spots. Now, as someone has previously said in one of their reviews, it's not so much about the ending of this novel as the beginning...very much like Joyce's Ulysses. The only question is, what does it all mean?

B00005QDW5|5.0|Echoes, that historical double-CD collection of the band's greatest numbers, can hardly be called a &quot;greatest hits&quot; collection by normal standards. Oh, sure, most of the Floyd classics are here: &quot;Arnold Layne&quot;, &quot;Money&quot;, &quot;Us and Them&quot;, &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;, &quot;Learning to Fly&quot;, etc. Also, there are songs missing that many of their fans wish were present: &quot;Have a Cigar,&quot; &quot;Welcome to the Machine,&quot; &quot;Brain Damage/Eclipse,&quot; and any selections from Atom Heart Mother (aka, The Cow Album). Also, two of their greatest songs here have been edited: the title track and Shine On You Crazy Diamond. So why is this still-impressive collection worth five stars? In two words: unified concept. Pink Floyd have always been a thinking listener's band, and they have managed to take two dozen or so of their greatest songs, meld the tracks together, and juxtapose the tracks in such a fashion that the songs, when played in this order, reveal fresh, sometimes startling new layers of meaning concerning their unified concept. And what is this key concept, the hidden, madcap thread that weaves through most of the songs on this album? Answer: Syd Barrett!!! Yes, the band's original guitarist, acid-eating freak turned genius-lunatic either composed most of the songs on this album (&quot;Arnold Layne,&quot; &quot;Jug Band Blues&quot;) or is in fact the subject matter of songs composed by the band's other members on later albums (&quot;Wish You Were Here,&quot; &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&quot;). Barrett's real-life descent into near-madness runs throughout the band's later material, particularly affecting bassist Roger Waters, who also suffered from a particularly strict childhood (&quot;Another Brick in the Wall&quot;) and loss of his father at an early age (the stunning, previously unreleased &quot;When the Tigers Broke Free&quot;; when this song is heard back to back with the very angry piece &quot;One ofThese Days,&quot; the effect is absolutely bone-chilling.) Other such amazing song juxtapositions are &quot;The Happiest Day of Our Lives&quot; backed with &quot;Another Brick In The Wall,&quot; and &quot;Set the Controls For the Heart of The Sun&quot; backed with &quot;Money&quot;. Listening to the Floyd's music in this fashion gives the listener an excellent picture of the band's collective consciousness in general and Syd Barrett's (and Roger Water's) twisted unconsciousness in particular. The listener is left literally stunned in the process as these 26 seemingly unrelated songs are coalesced into one luminous, incandescent whole. Get this collection today and listen to this old band with fresh new ears. You might just agree that indeed, Syd Barrett is and always will be the Pink in Pink Floyd.
B000022TSV|5.0|It is wonderfully singed, gloriously staged and unbelievably truthful opera. One may dislike the film -like settings but they do work as intended. It is dynamic, south -France flavored, sunny and tragic Carmen. I know only another Domingo's DVD that may pair with this one, the &quot;Cavaleria rusticana&quot;.
B001AKTZO6|5.0|BAYOU COUNTRY, which was the first great album by Creedence Clearwater Revival, has now been totally improved with warm, crisp 24-bit remastering and some bonus cuts. As a person who enjoys classic rock ranging from the Allman Brothers Band, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Marshall Tucker, and the Outlaws to Fleetwood Mac and Steve Miller to Deep Purple and Ted Nugent to Bruce Springsteen and Bob Seger, I feel that Creedence fits in with all of these bands in its own special way. This CD is a must-own for any fan of classic rock.
0385512104|4.0|Mark Haddon, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time (Doubleday, 2002)<br />It is quite likely that no one who reads The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is going to forget Christopher Boone soon after they put the novel down. Christopher Boone, an autistic (so the blurb from Oliver Sacks on the back tells us; all Christopher lets on is that he goes to a special school with \\"stupid kids\\") teenager, goes across the street one morning to find the neighbor's dog, Wellington, has been killed with a garden fork. He immediately becomes the prime suspect in the murder, as he's caught with body in hand, and figures it is in his best interests to find out who the real killer is. Finding this out uncovers a number of other mysteries, gives us remarkable insight into math and physics, and lets us get to know one of the more engaging narrators in recent fiction.<br />What makes Curious Incident work as well as it does is Christopher. \\"Quirky\\" is an understatement, but then that's to be expected when one is dealing with the mentally challenged. He is incessantly logical at times (the only student from his school to ever sit the maths A-level, as he plans to throughout the book), but incapable of mapping that logic onto many other areas of his life. He gets obsessed with some things and forgets others for hours on end; draws conclusions on certain parts of the investigation at a whim while digs into layer after layer of others.<br />In general, with the exception of the screaming and moaning fits, he's rather a lot like the rest of us. Add in a cracking mystery, and you've got a fun novel. Don't let its being picked by the Today Show for their book club fool you, this one will please reading snobs and the great unwashed alike. ****
B001AKTZPK|5.0|WILLY AND THE POOR BOYS, Creedence Clearwater Revival's best album, has, in its 2008 reissue, become even better, with warm, crisp 24-bit remastering and several bonus cuts. As a fan of such classic rock bands as Bruce Springsteen, Ted Nugent, Steve Miller, the Outlaws, Jackson Browne, Bob Seger, Deep Purple, Foghat, and Jethro Tull, I feel that, in its own special way, Creedence fits in with all of these great bands. With songs that transcend their era, including \\"Fortunate Son\\", which is even more relevant today thanks to the war in Iraq, this CD is a must-own for any classic rock fan.
B00003CXCW|5.0|This motion picture is simply a 5 star film by any definition of cinema art... period.  Hollywood criticizing itself in the post-war era is amazing enough, but with the perfectly cast players directed by Wilder, this film is sure fire on every note.  Swanson in the role of her life, overacting JUST as a former silent film star would, Holden as the impatient and reluctant beau, Stroheim as the former director locked in eternal love, satisfied to simply be at the &quot;greatest star's side&quot;....... and so many other characters playing themselves in real locations make this film authentic and compelling from the opening credit.<br />This DVD release is NOT perfect.. alas, the transfer IS the best I have seen in any format, but in the garage scenes and a few other very dark scenes, there is a sort of fluctuation in the contrast which is distracting at times.  I own a state of the art liquid crystal display, so for me it is visible... for most with CRT monitors, it may not be so easy to spot. The other downside is the dry and totally useless commentary by the author of Billy Wilder's book... which could have simply been left off the disc... the only reason to play it would be for someone who is visually impared, I would think.......  don't watch it.  These 2 points are definitely NOT enough to bring the 5 star rating down, nor do they take away from the beauty of the way this film has been brought to DVD with the stylish menus and extras.  <br />The upside is that the sound, menus, and &quot;making of&quot; portions of the DVD are first rate.  The menu is similar to a silent film and beauifully created.  Totally consistant with the look and feel of the film.  <br />ANY SERIOUS FILM BUFF, HISTORIAN, or STUDENT of film MUST see this film.  A masterpiece MAY be too trite to describe this amazing work of cinematic art.<br />There are FEW roles for actors that are this unique and spectacular as Swanson's in this film ... I can think of F. Murray Abraham in Amadeus, PeterFinch in Network, Bette Davis in All About Eve and Ben Kingsley in Gandhi among the few that are on this level.  See it for this performance if nothing else.
B001AKTZOQ|5.0|COSMO'S FACTORY, Creedence Clearwater Revival's fifth album, has been made even better, with warm, crisp 24-bit remastering and a total of four bonus cuts. As a person who listens to all types of classic rock, from Bob Seger to Ted Nugent to Steve Miller to the Outlaws to Jackson Browne, I feel that, in its own special way Creedence fits in with all of these great artists. With songs ranging from the joyous \\"Travellin' Band\\" and \\"Up Around The Bend\\" to the ominous \\"Who'll Stop The Rain\\" and \\"Run Through The Jungle\\", this CD is a must-own for any classic rock fan.

B001AKTZPA|5.0|GREEN RIVER, Creedence Clearwater Revival's second great album, has just been improved with warm, crisp 24-bit remastering and several bonus cuts. As a fan of classic rock artists including Bruce Springsteen, Ted Nugent, Steve Miller, the Outlaws, Jackson Browne, Bob Seger, and Deep Purple, I feel that, in its own special way, Creedence fits in with all of these bands. With great songs that warn us to not be too sure of our luck, this CD is a must-own for any fan of classic rock.
B00005JMCN|5.0|A sure classic.  One you can watch over and over again.  A must own.
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|Never have I heard a soundtrack that includes almost every single song that was in the movie.  Every song is great!  If you loved the movie you must buy this CD. If you want a CD that has just the right mix of songs and artists, this is the CD for you.  It has more tracks than what are shown on this site.  It does include the Christmas songs.  I have to give this 5 stars! It's one of the best CD's I own thus far.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|What a charming and powerful this movie is! Clearly, with 880 reviews and counting, this movie doesn't leave anyone indifferent. Unfortunately too many people don't seem to appreciate the subtlety and simplicity of Sofia Coppola's minimalistic script, where the characters communicate in understatements, and not in multistoreyed grammatically correct sentences like in so many amateur pseudo-cult movies these days(\\"Clerks\\" being the apex of needless verbosity). The characters, like all the real humans, and not cinematic dummies, don't have all the answers. They only feel that the answers to life's questions are hard to get on our own. Perhaps the answers they're looking for lie in the very process of communicating and sharing their experiences and feelings.<br />Bill Murray's acting is flawless, with exactly the right amount of dull desperation and weariness. I can't remember any actor making better use of his facial expressions and voice. And of course there are some great trademark one-liners, mostly tragicomic.<br />Scarlett Johansson's acting is very grown-up, introspective and very very subtle. She effectively plays a woman at the beginning of her life path, when all the roads are open, yet none of them seems to be the right way to go. <br />Tokyo is a perfectly surreal backdrop for the brief encounter and surprising friendship of the two main protagonists. Their cynicism (Charlotte: \\"I guess you're going thru a midlife crisis now. Have you bought your Porsche yet?\\", Bob: \\"No, but I was thinking about it\\") draws them to one another, while their hopefulness keeps them together. <br />At the very end of the movie, the farewell scene is both exhilarating and reaffirming. We don't hear what Bob whispers to Charlotte, but one can imagine those words are the words of hope and love. <br />DVD edition includes wonderful deleted scenes, which are as good as the scenes in the final cut of the movie, as well as an instructive conversation with Sofia Coppola and her collaborators. The Widescreen format of the film is a great advantage of the DVD edition: Tokyo is meant to be shown in widescreen, in all of its futuristic splendor.<br />All in all, the film is touching, beautiful, poignant, yet ultimately uplifting.
B00006879E|4.0|~~~~~I purchased Songs about Jane the day it came out and I have yet to be disappointed.  I had an added bonus of seeing them live at the Office Depot Center (Sunrise, FL) concert on March 5, 2004 (opening for John Mayer).<br />I was able to see just how talented these guys are.  They did not dissapoint me.  Their album and onstage performance are unforgettable.  I can't wait until they headline their own tour. They also each have their own individual style that makes them unique.  They are~~~~ definitely~~ not a cookie cutter band.  <br />This CD has a mix of styles. Sunday Morning and This Love are great songs.  They are also featured on the &quot;Love Actually&quot; soundtrack with a medley of two songs.  I have read reviews on this cd and while some people don't give it high remarks, I feel it doesn't get the praise it deserves.  Definitely purchase this CD, you will not be disappointed.~~~~~
B0001ENY6M|5.0|Powerfully moving music to the best film of all time.  This music fits in very well with each part and gives you goose bumps because of the powerful message it helps illustrate on the screen and in each viewers hearts. Whats the message of the movie?  That Jesus suffered pure unimaginable torturistic suffering to die on the cross for us to wipe away our sins and then rise from the dead in order to give us life. Check the Four gospels in the Bible: Matthew, Mark, Luke, John.
0688163173|3.0|Caution, SPOILERS.<br />Please, please, please someone write and explain the ending to me. I truly did not get it (and I'm not usually dumb)!! If we are to believe the ending, how is everything else explained? How did he and Chuck get there in the first place? Was that &quot;made up&quot; too? I thought it was very intriguing until the end. I felt duped.
B0000634EV|5.0|I know that some of you are reading this already thinking \\"5 stars? That's the most an album can get.\\" Point taken. First off, this CD has 15 tracks, plenty of music for your money. Secondly, it features an all-star lineup of stoner icons, such as Pepper Keenan (Corrosion Of Conformity), and Phil Anselmo (Pantera). For those of you who haven't heard a Down song, it's basically a hybrid mix of southern/stoner rock, and heavy metal. I enjoy most every track on the record, and usually let it play front-to-back when I listen to it.<br />Standout Tracks: Ghosts Along The Mississippi, Stained Glass Cross, Learn From This Mistake, New Orleans Is A Dying Whore, Where I'm Going, The Man That Follows Hell, Beautifully Depressed
B00014X8KO|5.0|From the makers behind &quot; Metropolis&quot;, &quot; Akira&quot;, &quot; Steamboy&quot; and &quot; Perfect Blue&quot; Katsuhiro Otomo, Koji Morimoto and Tensai Okamura comes a stunning collection of three fantasy tales beyond your imagination.<br />The first tale deals with space travelers who discover a spaceship inhabited by a former Opera singer and is controlled by a super computer. The second deals with a pharmaceutical company who accidently takes pills that give him the most retretched stench in the whole world causing people to drop like flies and the last tale is WWII inspired on cannon makers.<br />Beautifully animated and visionary anime tales with twists in the ends and originallity. Although the one Powerpuff Girl episode where Buttercup is stinking up a town is probably inspired by the second tale in the movie.<br />I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys anime, Akira, Ghost in the Shell, Robot Carnival, Metropolis, Fantasia, Heavy Metal, and Cowboy Bebop.
B00006L7XQ|4.0|Okay, first of all, this is Johnny Cash, and that name alone scores big points. One of the coolest things about this album is it lives and breathes with Johnny, it gives us a glimpse of his pain and age, and I think the solemn attitude of the entire record gave us all an empty feeling, one that signals the end of an era. Surely enough, not long after this album's release and the death of his wife, the man in black left us, and I like to listen to this album and think of it as Johnny writing us all into his will. His vocals are much deeper and sound much wiser. I personally think it's one of the best vocal performances of his career. The music on the record is a collection of covers and new songs that Johnny claims he spent countless hours writing. After hearing them, you will believe it.<br />Standout Tracks: I Hung My Head, The Man Comes Around, Hurt, Sam Hall, I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry
B00006879E|2.0|I couldn't agree more with the reviewers who note this band has:<br />1. One killer song, &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot;<BR>2. One OK one, &quot;This Love&quot;<BR>3. An album whose remainder is 50% NSYNC, 50% Jamiroquoi<br />Truly awful, but it gets more than one star for &quot;Harder to Breathe.&quot;<br />The Third Eye Blind of the mid-aughts.  Bonus making-fun-of-them points for the stupid lead singer comparing the band to Missy Elliot!  ZOINKS!  Check the Boston Globe's archives if you don't believe me.
B000002UJQ|3.0|Radiohead, to me, are the mediocre mix of Porcupine Tree and Pink Floyd. That being said, I can't give OK Computer any higher than 3 stars, and that may be a generous score. It's not as innovative as Pablo Honey, not  as good as The Bends, not as weak as Kid A, and not as stupid as Amnesiac. That basically puts it in the middle of their discography. At times the vocals closely resemble that of Porcupine Tree's musical/vocal giant, Steven Wilson. I might suggest to Radiohead that they drop the ever ongoing technology push, and just go back to making good ambient rock.<br />Standout Tracks: Lucky, Karma Police, Airbag, Climbing Up The Walls
B00018D44U|5.0|I am so impressed with \\"Feels Like Home\\" by Ms. Jones. First of all I think this cd is actually better than \\" Come Away with Me\\", which in the beginning I thought would have been damn near impossible. Her voice shines thru with haunting melody and their simply is no denying she has  the voice of someone well beyond her years! This cd is comprised of folk, blue-grass, jazz, blues and of course country. The ladder seem to be the most prominent. Many of the songs \\"grow\\" on you and when you listen with an open mind you will begin to understand what true artistic talent sounds and feels like. Each song, in my opinion, is quite different from the next and offers many a splendid mood, some however are quite sad and thought-provoking.  I am very critical of most music but Norah strikes a \\" Chord\\" in me like no other. When you listen to this cd you feel like your \\"part of that moment\\" and what she sings about can make you smile, feel nostalgic, sad, and brings you back to days when life was curious and new.  Beautiful instrumentals accompanied by an equally beautiful voice that makes owning this cd all the worth-while. I highy recommend this cd and paying $ 15-20 bucks on a cd that will last a lifetime is well worth the price and more!!  Ok, briefly I would like to offer my critique ( opinion ) on the tracks in \\" Feels Like Home\\".<BR>Track 1 is titled \\" Sunrise\\" which has received the mosr publicity and \\" airtime \\". This is a very good and upbeat song. The tempo is well set and her voice is quite prominent on this song whereas the instrumentation takes a \\" backseat\\" which I think for this song works well. <BR>track 2- \\" What Am I to You\\" is a great song with some nice guitar work for good measure.  I love this song..<BR>track 3- \\" Those sweet Words\\" is a nice song but not one of my favorites. Good lyrics and excellent drumming on this track. It's a light airy song that reminds me of the beginning of spring.  <BR>track 4- \\" Carnival town\\" the melody is cute but in reality this song, lyrically speaking, is abit sad and thought-provoking. The question is \\" Is it lonely\\"?  I think her answer is \\" Yes\\". Overall a good song.<BR>track 5- \\" In The Morning\\"-  mixed tempo, a solid song. The lyrics are god in this song. You will be tapping your feet while you listen to this song, even if it's early in the morning!<BR>track 6- \\" Be here to love me\\"- nice slow tempo song. Her lyrics are creative in this song! This song grows on you! It's a \\"sleeper hit\\" but it does the job well so WAKEUP!<BR>track 7 \\" Creepin In\\"-  Unlike many people I really enjoy this song! Great Tempo, good lyrics! Country all the way here, with blue-grass influence. This is one of those songs people will know the words to and sing along, even at her shows. I don't like Dolly Parton but she is good for this song. This is a keeper so get your hands off and buy your own!!  (:><BR>track 8- \\" Toes\\" another wonderful song with different melody changes which keeps you on and sometimes offguard. This is a very sexy and flirtatious soundng song. Reminds me of innocent puppy love turning into passion late at night. ( Winks )<BR>track 9- \\" Humble Me\\". Ladies and Gentlemen, we have before us the gem, the most powerful song both vocally and lyrically!!! This is a beautiful song full of sadness yet hints of better days to come. This might be the BEST song on the whole cd. I get goose-pimples when i hear this song and for some reason i always get introspective.. It's an honest song with no pretentions. This is Norahs genius shining thru and there aint no one that compares.<BR>track 10 \\" Above ground\\"-  I have mixed feelings about this song. It sounds rather \\"experimental\\" to me but there is nothing wrong with that. I believe they threw this song in to realy mix it up, and they did. It's got a dark, secret and moody feel to it that I like. A devious little number for sure.<BR>track 11  \\" The long way home\\" is my second favorite song on this cd! It's great and probably shows off her vocal talent the most. Very soulful and pure. I love the melody. This song is a great song to listen to when your driving late at night, alone. Trust me, when you listen to this cd in your car after work you will take the long way home too. So what if gas prices are high, it's Norah Jones!!<BR>track 12 \\" The Prettiest think\\" I love the opening of the song. It's a complete work of art. It's airy and dreamy and takes you away from the hustle and bustle of life. A good song to listen to with a date. A great slow dance song. Anyone feeling romantic?<BR>Track 13 \\" Don't miss you at all\\" Great piano work, a throwback in to the 40's. You gotta love it. A very visual song. Trust me, it will grown on you after a few listens..<BR>  Overall this cd is close to being a master-piece. It's timeless, sexy, sad, happy, nostalgic, haunting and wonderful. I listen to this cd at least once a day, from beginning to end and each time i do have a deeper appreciation for Norah Jones. Thank God for her because I was begining to think music as we knew it was subjugated by meaningless, fabricated, contrived pop music.  Norah has opened the prison cell and let the music out, FINALLY!!!!   Thank you Norah..
B0000VCZKM|1.0|I maybe ridiculed for this but, I don't even own this editon. Reason: NOT IN WIDESCREEN !!!  NEEDS TO BE IN ORIGINAL FORMATT!!!<BR>Annie deserves widescreen!!! - 2.35:1 !!!<br />Fan,<BR>Lance Lust
B00005S6K8|5.0|When I learned they were remaking the original \\"Sabrina,\\" I couldn't fathom any reputable actor would even attempt to fill Bogart's shoes. Yet Harrison Ford was a more than suitable choice. Julia Ormond, however, lacked the confidence Hepburn portrayed, making for a Sabrina not nearly as charming as the original. <br />Several years after seeing the remake in the theatre, I watched it again some Sunday afternoon, and was surprised by the affect it had. When not compared to the sassy, comical, melodramatic romance of the first movie, this new version - considered on its own merit - is a pensive, mature romance that takes its time considering small details, as Ormond emerges as Ford's humble equal, rather than being duped by infatuation. <br />I watch it about every other year now, and as I grow older, I only enjoy more this movie's careful attentiveness to detail and the lack of emotional manipulation characteristic of Hollywood romances.
B00018D44U|2.0|If you like country music, Dolly Parton or Tammy Wynette you will probably like this album. If you were expecting more of Jones' jazzy songs from her debut album, you'll be dissapointed.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|Have you ever gone away on a summer vacation or somewhere outside of your bubble, came across an individual that you connected with on many levels and spent hours or days enjoying their company until you part, never to see that person again, yet changed in so many ways by the experience?  Essentially that is the plot of Lost in Translation and if you've ever had that kind of experience more than likely you will come away touched by this beautifully moving, emotionally touching film.<br />If you like your films plot driven instead of character driven, then this film isn't for you. There's isn't much else to tell about Lost. Two lonely hearts, alienated by their personal lives and befuddled by Tokyo's cultural and communicational differences, reach out to each other, bond on many different levels while exploring Tokyo and learn more about who they are along the way.  When the final frame concluded, I found myself sobbing in my chair.  I have been fortunate enough to have a similar experience (although not in Tokyo) and was incredibly touched by Lost in Translation.<br />Murray is fantastic and subtle, Johansson is a breath of fresh air, Coppola's direction and cinematography is superb and the soundtrack is flawless.  Although definitely Oscar worthy on all counts, I think the media hype hurt rather than helped the film.  Some people who saw this based on the hype came away disappointed and frustrated (see any of the one or two starred reviews below).  See this film ONLY if you meant to see it before it got all the media recognition.<br />In closing, I don't think Coppola was trying to be artsy or trying to send a message.  I think she was honestly trying to show two lonely people connecting with each other on a personal face-to-face level.  We seem to have forgotten how to do that in our cell phone/laptop/PDA obsessed society. Nice work Sophia.  Very nice work.
B00004U8JV|4.0|I loved this movie, especially the wonderful special effects.  The story would have been wonderful had the producer and director cut every scene with Jeff Goldblum and his goofy daughter.  These two characters had no place in this story.  Whatever happened to Sam O'Neill when we needed him? The only way to watch this movie is to use your mute button whenever these two begin to speak.  Other than that this was a fun picture.  It was crisp and fast paced and very exciting.
0671027387|2.0|Reading Dan Brown's second novel, it's remarkable how quickly his characterization abilities evolved.  \\"Deception Point\\" has only one good thing going for it: It's conspiracy/scientific plotline.  The book has cardboard standins instead of fully formed charaters.  If he couldn't write action well, this book would merit no stars.<br />The book starts, like his others, with a mysterious murder, this time in the Arctic Circle.  Then, it moves to Washington DC, and introduces us to Rachel Sexton, a top intelligence analyst with the National Reconnaissance Office, and the only daughter of presidential candidate Sen. Shelby Saxton.  Sen. Saxton is perhaps one of the worst writter characters ever concieved.  He is the epitome of corruption, both political and moral, the kind of stupid yet evil politician that exists only in very poorly written novels like this one.  His daugter, of course, is the exact opposite, hates her father, misses her sainted mother who has died, and wants to do good in the world and protect her country.  The first chapter has them meeting for an emotionally chilly breakfast. Then, the story diverges, one following the Senator as he campaigns for President on the bizzare platform of essentially eliminating NASA, and the other following Rachel to the headquarters of the National Reconnassiance Office, which Brown describes as the CIA without the leaks, assasination plots, and general incompetence.<br />Rachel is called upon by the President to go to the Arctic circle and verify the results of several scientists who have been working on NASA's discovery of a very special meteorite.  I won't give away what's special about the meteorite, but Brown certainly gives it away as soon as \\"NASA\\", \\"Meteorite\\" and \\"Arctic Circle\\" are mentioned.  It's not hard to guess.  That he goes on for about 100 more pages before actually saying it is emmensely annoying.  You want to hurt him for forcing you to page through the very poorly written Washington/Presidential Campaign subplot.<br />On that subplot, since Sen. Sexton is the political bad guy, the President is a lot like Martin Sheen's fictional President Bartlett, only morally perfect and not prone to quoting latin to show how smart he is.  Brown, who did SOME research on Catholic \\"history\\" for \\"Angels & Demons\\" and \\"DaVinci\\", apparently has never been to Washington DC, seen a documentary about politcs, or ever followed a camapign in his life.  He has no knowledge of the city, the way things work in DC, or, apparently, how campaigns for President are conducted.  His \\"power politics\\" dialogue is poor enough to make a high school creative writing class look like Shakespere.  And when the plot actually gets intersting he keeps shifting to the utterly dull Washington story.<br />The Arctic story involves a conpiracy so massive it could destroy the President and elect the hideous Sen. Sexton to office.  Since Sexton has the moral character of a paper cup, it's obvious who we're rooting for, though Brown does his usual \\"lets keep 'em guessing\\" routine, giving us about a dozen potential top villians until we fidn the real one.  I think I guessed who was behind it pretty quickly.  It's amazing \\"Angels & Demons\\" came out so soon after this poor effort, as that had an incredibly complex conpsiracy that I don't think anyone could crack.  This one could be solved by Encyclopedia Brown on an off day.  Anyway, Rachel and her scientist love interest are pursued by assasins once they learn a conspiracy exists.  They have to warn the Bestest, Most Nicest President Ever that he's being set up.  It's fast paced and reads well, as Brown does know how to write interesting action and throws his heros into mortal danger.  In this, you can see his talent already.<br />The other problem I had with this book is the same one I have with the other two that I have read by Brown.  He includes an author's note saying \\"The Delta Force, the National Reconassiance Office and Space Freedon Federation are all real organizations.  The tchnologies described within all exist\\".  Well yes, Delta Force, the NRO, and the SFF ARE real organizations, however they aren't real in the way Brown describes them.  Delta Force cannot be used as a personal black ops/assasiantion team for whoever decides to use them.  The NRO is not the largest intellgence agency in Washington, but is in fact a rather small operationa that ANSWERS to the CIA, and I'm pretty sure the SFF isn't full of nasty evil people bent on destroying science.  Brown never says his represntations of these organizations are true, but by adding the author's note at the beginning, he probably convinced far too many people that the NRO is the nation's highest guarded secret and whatnot.  I'm willing to forgive him INVENTING an agency that has more power than the CIA, but to attribute it to a real life one really takes you out of the story.  Also, while in most instances of reading I could care less whether the technology is real or not, all that is real about many of the gadgets described in the book is that someone, someday hopes to build them.  It's unlike a Michael Chrichton novel, where he writes with such authority and never pretends that what he's writing about EXISTS RIGHT NOW.  So much of the book is predicated on half-truths purporting to be facts.  Which wouldn't be a problem if he hadn't gone out of his way to give the impression he was giving a true account of technology and real agencies.<br />The book was follows the exact same blueprint for his other novels.  I assume Brown will keep writing like this, finding a new conspiracy to drop into his magic, bestseller formula.  And while it appears as if his novels can only continue to improve, it's a shame that he relies on putting up theories as facts and misrepresenting agencies and organizations in ways that are detrimental to the real people who work there.  Only die-hard Brown fans should pick this one up.all real organizations.  The tchnologies described within all exist\\".

Which wouldn't be a problem if he hadn't gone out of his way to give the impression he was giving a true account of technology and real agencies.<br />The book was follows the exact same blueprint for his other novels.  I assume Brown will keep writing like this, finding a new conspiracy to drop into his magic, bestseller formula.  And while it appears as if his novels can only continue to improve, it's a shame that he relies on putting up theories as facts and misrepresenting agencies and organizations in ways that are detrimental to the real people who work there.  Only die-hard Brown fans should pick this one up.
B00004Z459|4.0|First of all to the idiot that said that they lack a bass player.  They do in fact have one.  Mike himself is the bass player.  Secondly this CD is great I really enjoyed listening to it.  My favorite song off it has got to be &quot;In The End&quot;. I would suggested buying this CD rather your into rap or rock.  This CD has something for everyone.
0893860220|5.0|It truly is the last book to be read for a purpose. If you find yourself still looking for more spiritual literature, after having read this book, re-read it. You may have missed the point. There is nothing to seek. This book is the best pointer to reality. I urge you to own it, read it, and remember it all the time.
B00006CXXU|2.0|This cd was o.k. but not as good as other artists some of the stuff on this album wasn't deep at all. <br />Can't hold us down- Good message but she sounds like shes shouting. Lil kim is alright. But when mixed with her image and what she says shes a hypocrite she talks about women impowerment but brings down powerful women. 7/10<br />Walk Away- an educated Middle schooler could of wrote this. She talks and wines about how she can't stay away from some guy. 3/10<br />Fighter- Good message but not original see britneys song stronger is much better and britney dosen't shout the whole song.  4/10<br />Infatuation- Talks about latin heratiage and sings a boring song the beat is nice. 5/10<br />Loving Me For Me- Boring 1/10<br />Impossiable- A good song but it is because of alicia keys. 8/10<br />Underapperciated- A alright message and song 8/10<br />Beautiful- A master peice one of the very few songs that she dosen't shout and that dosen't sound boring good message but why did she say she was beautiful then change everyting about her self? It sounds like she dosen't have alot of confidence. 9.5/10<br />Make Over- Boring. Big let down 1/10<br />Cruz- Boring 1/10<br />Soar- Boring 1/10<br />Get Mine Get Yours- Good song 8/10<br />Dirrty- Bad single. Hate this song. 4/10<br />Voice with in- Another master peice i love this song 10/10<br />I'm O.K.- Great song probably one of the only deep songs on the album.<br />Keep Singing My Song- I feel asleep to this one. 2.5/10
B0000C6E4D|3.0|Afterglow is the kind of album that grows on you slowly, but surely after listening to it over and over...  I listened to it for the first time and found that I immediately enjoyed &quot;Fallen,&quot; &quot;Push,&quot; &quot;Perfect Girl,&quot; and &quot;Drifting.&quot;  &quot;Stupid&quot; took some time to work on me, but finally pushed its way into being one of my favorite songs.  I was introduced to Sarah after her Surfacing album, which I thoroughly enjoyed from start to finish.  After her 5-year hiatus, I didn't know what to expect from her new album, but she is as melancholy as ever (an element in her songwriting which I've always enjoyed), yet still quite poignant.  Those who enjoy Surfacing's haunting, melancholy mood will enjoy Afterglow.  However, if you're looking for something upbeat or inspiring, this album isn't for you.  I haven't heard Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, but would definitely recommend Surfacing before Afterflow.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This cd is so great. Her voice shines and is very versitle threw this album.<br />Me Against the Music- I liked this song I thought it was great. I loved the music video and the song. 8/10<br />I've Got That Boom Boom- I liked this song to but its has no staying power you get tired of it very easy. If She released it as a single it would be hot for about a month but then i would get tiring. 7/10<br />Showdown- Sexy song. This song is hot. I didn't like it before but now i love it. 8/10<br />Breathe On Me- This song is so kylie minogue. But she dose a better version of it then she ever would. This song is either really cool and breezy or white hot. I love it. This is the first song i think about when i hear in the zone. 9/10<br />Early Morning- the worst song ever on this album she talks about her hang over and partying. Who ever produced this should be toutured. 4/10<br />Toxic- This song was decent but then when she made the video and then when she sang it live she made it a thousand times better then what it was. The lyrics are great and its great. 9.5/10<br />Outrageous- Jive wanted this to be the 2nd single. I like it i think its great. I liked R. kelly in it. I love the song. 9/10<br />Touch of My Hand- 4 words Con-tro-verse-y the song is great and her voice really shines threw. This is the madonna in her just with better vocals. 8/10<br />The Hook Up- Major dance song. This song is pretty decent this is britneys regeaee. 9/10<br />Shadow- She shows major control of her voice in this song. Great song. Ballad. 8/10<br />Brave New Girl- Sounds like it should be in the track of the next legally blonde movie. Kind of inspirational. 6/10<br />Everytime- Her voice is raw and great in this song. One of her best. 9.5/10<br />Remix MATM- European remix. 8/10
B00018D44U|3.0|This is a good sophomore effort by Norah Jones in an attempt to try something different to her follow-up multi-platinum Grammy-winning smash, Come Away With Me.  When I first received Come Away With Me, I played it in my CD for hours and days, potentially killing the CD.  Not so when I received Feels Like Home.  Norah Jones' sultry voice still comes alive on songs like &quot;Sunrise,&quot; &quot;Humble Me,&quot; and &quot;The Prettiest Thing,&quot; which placates the cravings of listeners who want to hear something similar to Come Away With Me.  Songs such as &quot;Toes&quot; and &quot;Creepin' In&quot; (duet with Dolly Parton) can drive the listener nuts (namely if you don't like country music).  I was able to wholeheartedly recommend Come Away With Me, but I don't feel the same way with Feels Like Home.  It was a good effort by Norah Jones to try something new, but the elements just don't add up. Miss Jones can do better.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I don't know how to accurately express the greatness of this album.  Norah Jones struck GOLD with Come Away With Me.  This album is relaxing, sexy, soothing... perfect for a summer afternoon, perfect for winding down, and perfect for spending time with that special someone.  Her sultry voice works perfectly on these jazz-like tunes such as \\"Come Away With Me,\\" \\"Shoot The Moon,\\" \\"One Flight Down,\\" and \\"The Nearness of You.\\"  The mood of the album is somber, sexy, and a bit melancholy at times.  This is not an upbeat, get-on-your-feet album.  I would highly recommend this album to jazz fans or those who like to listen to easy listening music.  Those who enjoy Top 40 and pop would probably not enjoy this album.
0385504209|4.0|i am a catholic and am currently reading this book. lots of criticisms has been said regarding the church and even the media is bragging about every controversies here. you see, i love books and i appreciate every kind of it. for me, this book is only fictional. though the author stated some true researches which many said are false ones, i believe him enough to love all his books. i am not against this book even if i am a catholic. i believe if the truth is really for real, then we just have to accept it. happy reading!!!
B00015HVI8|5.0|The 2 part season opener is great, like a full length feature movie.  There are a few weak moments in the set but overall it easily qualifies for the 5 star rating.
B0000025JT|5.0|For anyone who enjoys popular music, this collaboration between Barbra Streisand and Barry Gibb is sheer perfection. For the type of music it is, it couldn't possibly be any better. It is thoroughly enjoyable, supplying ballads, athems, and dance music. Barbra's voice is alternately delicate and strong, sexy and angry, gentle and powerful. Her voice is, in a word, sensational. The compositions sound as if they were written specifically for her (and all but \\"The Love Inside\\" were). Her duets with Barry Gibb, though perhaps unexpected by some, are pitch perfect. This is pop perfection.
B0000019HU|5.0|A previous reviewer said that, and I don't think truer words could be said about this album.<br /><br />Back in 1991, I was writing for a fanzine. I'd become friends with one of the other writers, and he was the one who generally got first pick of the many pre-release copies that were sent in for review. Whenever I went over to his place he'd turn me on to stuff from the latest batch that he thought was worthy of our attention. One day he seemed particularly excited- &#34;This record is... it's... listen to this.&#34; He put Spiderland on and the first song, Breadcrumb Trail, began playing. After a couple of minutes I became restless and so he skipped to the next song. Another couple minutes later, to the next. (In my defense, I recall the situation was that I was there to pick him up and drive us to a gig, not sit and listen to records.) As he turned the LP over to side 2, I asked something like &#34;So... is that all they do?&#34; He deflated and said &#34;Man, you don't get it.&#34; And he was right, I didn't. Back in those days I was listening almost exclusively to heavy, thunderous, scary stuff like the Melvins, Godflesh, Helmet, the Jesus Lizard, the Laughing Hyenas, the Cows, etc. Meanwhile, much of the music on Spiderland is barely half a step above pure silence. Lyrics are muttered or whispered. The crystal clean guitars sound like their strings are made of delicate spun glass that would shatter if strummed too hard. This music was so incredibly tentative, subdued and low key, it barely even registered as music to my ear. I thought it sounded like some guys playing in someone's bedroom during the middle of the night, trying not the wake up the parents in the next room. There are a few intense explosive moments, but ironically they're drowned out by the quiet washing over them. It simply did not compute for me. But it did for my friend, and it seemed like any time I went over to his place in those days, he was always listening to Spiderland. I quickly developed a habit of ignoring it as background ambiance.<br /><br />A few weeks later, I was browsing around in a local mom & pop record shop. The clerk was playing something on the stereo. It was very familiar and pleasing to my ears, I knew I'd heard it before many times, but I couldn't for the life of me identify it. It wasn't even on the tip of my tongue, I had to ask him to find out that it was, of course, Spiderland. It took some time, but it had eventually managed to worm its way into my brain and into my heart. That was when I bought my own copy, and it's been somewhere in my All Time Top 5 ever since. I love it for being so incredibly soothing, hypnotic, and unsettling. At times, simultaneously. As time went by, Spiderland became fairly influential, a lot of bands borrowed from it and aped it. But when it was new, there was literally nothing else like it.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />EDIT Apr 21, 2014:<br /><br />Spiderland was about 13 years old when I wrote that review. Now it's more than old enough to buy beer, and Touch & Go has just re-issued it in a very fancy deluxe box set. They've remastered the album and included 14 bonus tracks. It's neat to hear practice and demo versions of familiar songs, but there's some real treasure here- Two outtakes from the Spiderland sessions- one of them is an unreleased song called Pam (unless you count live bootlegs,) and I think I can understand why they'd leave it off the album. The other is a re-recording of Glenn from the self titled posthumous 10 inch single (which was actually recorded before Spiderland.) And then, the true crown jewels: two post-Spiderland demos, &#34;Todd's Song&#34; and &#34;Brian's Song.&#34; They're obviously rough works in progress, but after pining for &#34;new Slint&#34; for over 20 years, how amazing to finally get some. They aren't the greatest pieces of music in the world, but you can hear the potential. They clearly sound like music by &#34;the guys who had previously recorded Spiderland,&#34; with hints of growth and evolution. Kinda re-opens the old wounds... if only they could have kept it together for at least one more album.<br /><br />The box also contains a huge scrap book (which includes all of Spiderland's lyrics- finally I know what he's saying in Nosferatu Man- &#34;Night came, tomorrow was no more&#34; &#34;I couldn't hook that beautiful girl&#34; [!!!]) and best of all- a 90 minute Slint documentary DVD entitled Breadcrumb Trail. Again, something I've wanted for 20 years. Can't believe it finally actually exists.hints of growth and evolution.

0385510438|3.0|I did not mean to imply that this was a bad book. Far from it. It is entertaining in it's own homely way but It's certainly not the John Grisham I remember from the eighties, the Grisham that wrote the edge of your seat thrillers like The Firm and The Pelican Brief.<br />\\"A jury sentenced Danny Padgitt to life in prison. He sentenced them to death!\\"<br />Setting<br />Welcome to Clanton, Ford County, Mississippi. Grisham returns the the setting for the first book he ever wrote, Time to Kill, for his latest release, The Last Juror.<br />Meet Joyner William Traynor aka Willie Traynor. Willie, who is the narrator for this story, is a reporter for The Ford County Times, when the newspaper goes bankrupt. Having freshly graduated from Syracuse University with a degree in Journalism, Willie is in a position, with the help of his wealthy Grandmother, BeeBee, to buy the newspaper and does.<br />Plot<br />Willie is barely settling in as the Owner/Publisher/Editor etc. of his weekly publication, when the circulation is given a boost because of a particularly gruesome and violent murder of a widow named Rhoda Kassellaw. Danny Padgitt, one of the sons of a notorious, semi-legitimate clan of moonshiners and timber millers, who inhabit a nearby island, is arrested for the crime, after crashing his truck, making a getaway.<br />Sandwiched between the arrest and trial of Danny Padgitt, Willie decides to write a human interest story on a prominent local black family - the Ruffins. This remarkable family has eight children, seven of which have earned, not only college degrees but PHDs and are currently professors at various leading universities.<br />Upon their initial meeting, Miss Callie, the Ruffin family matriarch, serves Willie a scrumptious luncheon and Willie and Callie hit it off wonderfully and become fast friends. Later Callie is the Last Juror chosen for the Padgitt murder trial and thereupon sets history as the first Negro juror in Mississippi history.<br />The Trial<br />All the evidence points to Danny's guilt and even though he threatened to get the twelve jurors, if they find him guilty, (including Willie's newfound friend Callie Ruffin), the jury still finds him guilty.<br />Though the Juror's found Padgitt guilty of rape and murder, they cannot come to a consensus on the death penalty, so Padgitt is automatically sentenced to the alternative, Life in Prison, which at that time in Mississippi equated to ten years, less with good behavior, a fact that is withheld from juries. This angers the townfolk as they were sure that Padgitt would get the Gas Chamber. Everybody was mad but they didn't know who to be angry with, because the the jurors swore an oath to keep the vote a secret.<br />From this point forward we digress into a fairly dull albeit interesting dissertation, with a couple exceptions, about Willie's interaction in the community and how he turns a marginally profitable newspaper into a successful one.<br />The exceptions are where they try to sneak a parole hearing through for Padgitt and where Padgitt is observed in a work release program with little or no security. Our protagonist, Willie, shows up and rains on their (the Padgitt's) parade in both cases but the writing is on the wall. They are determined to get Danny Padgitt out and eventually they do.<br />Conclusion<br />I won't kid you about this book. I have very mixed feelings about what I read. On the one hand, it a warm friendly story about a fairly sleepy fictitious town and county in Mississippi, pretty much describing rural life in the South in the Seventies. And of course, Grisham has one of the best writing styles around. For this book he even added some southern homilies to make it feel more warm and fuzzy.<br />Except for the Padgitts and their sleazy lawyer, Lucien Wilbanks, the characters are likable if not lovable. The warm, lovable Callie Ruffin kept reminding me of Oprah Winfrey, though I don't know why. Other interesting individuals were Baggy, thestaff reporter, who is drunk after twelve noon, Harry Rex, a lawyer and carryover from A Time to Kill, and Wiley, the part time staff photographer.<br />Once Danny Padgitt was sent off to prison, after a third of the book, with rare exceptions it was like reading Driving Miss Daisy. Grisham described how Willie had lunch every Thursday with Callie, and the techniques Willie used to build up the Paper and how he visited each of Ford Counties eighty some Churches for service, one per week and then finally, for about the last forty pages things got suspenseful again and does not end the way you are lead to believe.<br />Again, I say this still held my interest, there was never a danger of my not finishing the book, it's just that I buy Grisham for excitement, for thrills. This was vintage Grisham, sans the thrills and intrigue. Unfortunately he's been doing that a lot lately.were Baggy, the staff reporter, who is drunk after twelve noon, Harry Rex, a lawyer and carryover from A Time to Kill, and Wiley, the part time staff photographer. <br />Once Danny Padgitt was sent off to prison, after a third of the book, with rare exceptions it was like reading Driving Miss Daisy.

B000062YAZ|1.0|Well, um, wow, what can I say about this album.  I need to warn you now, this review is coming from someone who is very open minded about music in general and listens to almost anything you can imagine, from classical, to funk, to pop, to rap, to various types of rock (punk, hardcore, metal, etc).  This is not the typical review here, posted by overzealous Slayer fanatics.  348 reviews before me gave this an average rating of 4 and a half stars.  This just shows me that people have no idea what good music really is.<br />Where should I start.  I expected this album to be BRUTAL.  When I think brutal, I think of HARD stuff.  This album is not in the least bit brutal or intense.  It's fast, that's about it.  The guitarists, while good, do nothing spectacular, and in fact, didn't impress me one bit with their &quot;legendary&quot; riffs, which, by the way, sound strikingly similar in many songs.  Being a drummer myself, I can say the drummer is nothing to write home about.<br />Now we get to the best part (or worst, depending on how you look at it).  The singer.  Oh-my-dear-god.  Not only is this the epitomy of terrible lyric writing, but his voice is pathetic.  It has no character or tone to it whatsoever, and sounds exactly the same in every song.  He has no dynamics, simply repeating the same rhythms over and over.  I dont know what else to say about the singing on this album except that it just plain sucks.<br />I suppose, if you're one of those overzealous Slayer fans that think these guys are the greatest thing since sliced bread, you'll enjoy this.  If, on the other hand, you appreciate good musicianship, musical variety, talented lyric writers, and an overall sense of taste, you probably wont enjoy this album for more than one song, at best.  If you've never heard Slayer before and have been pumped up by the hype surrounding them, then please, save yourself the time, and the money, and buy something else.  You wont be missing anything important.  <br />There are countless bands that are far, far better than this.  This album is simply a joke.

0783226837|4.0|Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward are a pair on down-on-their-luck guys living in the small town of Perfection (population 16).  They have decided it is finally time to get out of the valley and head for Bixby.  But they have made their decision one day too late.  Strange events have them running back and forth as they try to leave.  Then a rockslide closes the only road out of the valley.  Now they are stuck with the other residents including the Gummers played by Reba McEntire and Michael Gross.<br />Strange deaths and missing animals have started to occur in the valley.  Then something grabs the guys truck and everyone sees a snake monster and gets their first view of the graboids.  But while trying to warn others about the snake monsters, Fred and Kevin discover the monsters are much bigger than thought and they travel under the ground.<br />The rest of the movie has the inhabitants banding together first to avoid the monsters, then to destroy them and get out of the valley.  Some survive and some do not.<br />The action is tense with moments of humor (I love the pole vaulting and the headlights shining in the sky).  The monsters are very well done and very original.  Good performances from most of the cast add to the mix resulting in a tight and fun creature film.  This is a real must see for creature fans.  My wife, not a fan of horror or monsters, also liked this movie when we first saw it.
B00000I2PG|5.0|When I heard this album back in 1982, I knew this was to be a sure shot classic. ABC puts together a self-assured, fashionable dive in creating such classy, tuneful dance pop songs with such first-rate literal and metaphoric style with &quot;Lexicon Of Love&quot;. Every fantastic track on this CD shines with enhanced sonic clarity thanks in part to the fantastic production by Trevor Horn. Simply a must have for any collection!
1558908323|4.0|Strickler's disease is killing the children of Manhattan.  No cure can be found so experts tackle the disease at the source: cockroaches.  Roaches have their DNA combined with termites and mantids to create the Judas Breed. They are short-lived and deadly to other roaches.  Epidemic ended.<br />But years later, events start happening that point to the Judas having survived and become far nastier.  They are now man-sized and have two plates that when put together look like a human face.  The bugs are breeding beneath the streets and they are discovered by the team that created them and a transit guard.<br />The group is stuck far beneath the city and they must do everything they can to stop the bugs and get word out.<br />Some excellent acting and interesting characters make this big bug movie stand above the rest.  While there are B-movies in its parentage, this is better than a B-movie.  Check it out.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This is a truly amazing musical.  The sets, the acting, the humor and the dramatic touches all lend to an excellent story that transports you back into the Land of Oz, but told from a different perspective.  The Cast Recording album, like most Broadway recordings, captures the main songs and pieces that advance the story.  While not a substitute for the real thing, this album evokes memories from the show and also entertains those who haven't yet seen the production.<br />Truly a first rate album and production!  I see Tonys written all over this one.
1878424319|5.0|What a wonderful outlook on life and inward look at ourselves.  This book just made sense - pure and simple.  I've recommended to several friends who have enjoyed it as much.  As you read it, you will find that these &quot;agreements&quot; are ones we can all easily find within ourselves and live by.  And, you won't get lost in the words.  I highly recommend it and &quot;The Companion Book&quot; is a must have also.  Actually, any of his readings will give insight to much we already have within ourselves - these just make us rethink what we know and encourage us to bring the &quot;philosophies&quot; back into our lives.  A must read!

Jem and his sister (the story is told from her point of view) become deeply involved in trying to make their deranged neighbor, Bo Radley, come outside from the house he never leaves.  While their father, Atticus Finch fights for the rights of an innocent black man accused of raping a young white woman.  Everything is turned upside down, the way the sleepy town has never seen before.<br /> The twisting and turning of this awesome story will leave you wondering what will happen next.  You won't be expecting the surprise ending of this timeless classic.  This book is for the older, more experienced reader with some cruel language and adult situations.  I did like this book, but needed to keep a dictionary by my side.
1558216847|1.0|Odd that Rawicz's Mongolians walk everywhere rather than ride horses, and dress in conical hats (something no one else has observed). Odd that he claims to have gone for 12 days in the Gobi without water - he must have been ready for a beer or two after that.  And perhaps he had consumed more than a couple of beers when he met the yetis in the high Himalayas. <br />It's also odd that Rawicz has refused to authenticate any of his claims and declined to produce records, photographs, witnesses, or the full identity or whereabouts of the other survivors.<br />I think the bit on the cover, which claims that this is a \\"true story\\", may need revising.

B00005JMJ4|1.0|I'm sure some will dismiss me as a simple rube for dissing this movie, but after hearing so many people describe this movie as incredible, amazing, and basically the greatest art film/Bill Murray movie ever, I must say I was profoundly underwhelmed by this movie when I saw it.<br />Bill Murray is nowhere near as subtly brilliant as he was in Groundhog Day.  Scarlett Johannsen's acting seems to consist of parading around in a sweater and underwear - we started COUNTING the number of scenes where that's her outfit, it became so ridiculous  - and chain smoking and making a half-giggle/half-snort to Murray's every comment.  The plot development was nonexistent, and I got no sense of an actual connection between these two characters -- only that the director was trying to hit us over the head by telling us they had a connection.<br />But what I found most incredibly disturbing about this movie was its not-too-veiled racism and blatant stereotypes about Japanese people.  This movie didn't contain a single Japanese character that wasn't a caricature or offensive. The scene with the prostitute asking Bill Murray to &quot;Lip my Hose&quot; was unbearable to watch.<br />Sofia Coppola has a few good scenes that transcend the movie's overall feel of  freshman year film school pretention -- but certainly nothing Oscar-worthy.  The writing is stilted in many places, and could have used a good edit or re-write.
0385504209|2.0|After all of the reviews I was expecting a good thriller to involve me.  However, the writing style is just not that good.  The author never misses a chance to let the reader (the ignorant masses, I suppose) know how much he, the author, knows ... about just about everything, turning the read into a plodding effort.  Further, too many of the interior monologues are just downright sappy, which eventually renders the protagonist to a cartoon character status.<br />Long and short, if you are well-read and with a wide reading interest, you are probably going to be bored fairly quickly.

All my numerous history books agree with what is reported (see Honda Katsuichi's first person accounts in the &quot;Nanjing Massacre&quot;).<BR> I believe many of the low 1 star reviews are posted by Japanese Nationals who cannot accept the truth and want the book to post a low overall rating! Like many of my fellow Americans who cannot accept resposibility for killing millions in Vietnam (or the 250,000 people in the nuclear bombs on Japan).<BR>The country of origin can be faked in an e-mail. <BR>The rape continues!
B00006JLX4|5.0|Pavement is a band that has received infinite critical praise for over ten years and less than infinite commercial success, to say the least. 'Slanted And Enchanted' is one of those albums on a million Top 100 lists, but still baffles a good number of the people who listen to it on why exactly it's on those lists. Honestly, this isn't a record for everybody. Stephen Malkmus, now an indie hero, was just a local punk with a guitar trying to make some noise, and he and his band released one of the most heralded albums ever.<BR>I'm not an indie rock enthusiast, but I can honestly say to the naysayers that under the fuzz and distortion lie real melodies and harmonies, but this won't be your favorite album after the first listen. Malkmus' lyrics sometimes border on the inane, and sometimes the dissonance is harsh, but it all has a geniune quality to it. 'In The Mouth A Desert' has a great pop melody, 'Summer Babe (Winter Version)' is a great opening to the album (and shows where bands like Weezer came from), and 'Here' is one of the best rock songs of the early 90s. There are a few strange moments like 'Chesley's Little Wrists' but luckily they're the really short songs.<BR>The reissue is one of the best reissues EVER. This is the cost of a regular single album, but has a second disc full of rare recordings, and a big booklet and nice packaging to boot. This is how albums should be reissued, this and the Rhino Records reissues of the Elvis Costello back catalogue are the way it should be done.<BR>All in all, 'Slanted and Enchanted' is an album that fans of early 90s rock will probably enjoy, but still isn't for everybody. Maybe being #5 on Spin's Top 100 of the 90s is pushing it a bit, but it definitely isn't too far away. You don't have to be a snob or a critic to enjoy a good rock album a little left of the mainstream.
B000189WO6|5.0|These guys blow my mind like no one has since Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Jimi Hendrix, King Crimson, Blue Oyster Cult, Rush, Rage Against the Machine, Jane's Addiction, Living Colour, Frank Zappa, Santana, Return to Forever, Jaco Pastorius, Weather Report, etc.  Wow.  Makes most of what's out there seem stunted and impish.  Nuf said.
0385504209|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read! Great characterization, fast and intricate plot, interesting puzzles I couldn't even begin to fathom, and a fascinating central theme. I've read a couple books now by this author, and really admire his writing and his research. His books are hard to put down--you find yourself devouring them at 3:00 a.m.<br />For those reviewers who don't like this book, I'm wondering: Gee, having a little problem integrating your feminine side? Lighten up! Chew on some of the ideas for awhile before you spit them out so quickly and vehemently. You may find some nuggets of gold that get you to think outside of your box.
0446677450|1.0|I still can't comprehend how anyone thinks that Kiyosaki's garbage is going to lead them to the holy grail of financial freedom.  He has made most, if not all, of his fortune peddling his mindless garbage to idiots worldwide who are all too eager to lap it up.  I'm guessing these are the same high school dropouts with  horrendous credit and no assets who have enriched late night infomercial kings errrr....financial powerhouses like Carleton Sheets, Don Lupre, and Russ Whitney.  Do a little research and you'll quickly find that there is absolutely no documentary evidence to support the investment activities Kiyosaki claims to have excelled in.  Many of these activities, by the way, are required by law to be disclosed in public records.  Some of the sane 1 star reviewers like myself have wisely suggested that if you are truly interested in reading Kiyosaki's worthless ramblings, check out his nonsense from the library rather than buying it.  Saving money by not purchasing his snake oil is far better financial advice than you'll find in any of Kiyosaki's books.  Oh yeah, that qwack C.P.A. who aligned herself with him (clearly just a parasite on his gravy train) should have her license revoked.
B00005YW4H|1.0|&quot;Come Away With Me&quot; the debut album for a singer who cannot even carry a tune! I have always wondered why she won all those Grammies. Her voice is so dull and boring! She looks boring. Boring Norah for a boring album. I'm glad she's easily forgotten and her second offering sounds corny as well. I'll throw her up in the lines of the very plaintive and annoying Alicia Keys! Go get Nelly Furtado instead!
B0000TB03W|5.0|Ok some of my friends don't like Shania's music but like to look at her but forget her looks because this girl can \\"ROCK!\\" the foundations of your house (With a good stereo or home theatre system that is.). Shania Twain puts a new twist on county music, mixing pop, rock and county music together to put on one hell of a concert. The 22 songs a fantastic, the high-lights of the concert are (Songs.) \\"Honey I'm home\\", \\"When you kiss me (Now watch out because there is a surprise before she performs the song for two very lucky fans.)\\", \\"(Another surprise here again for two fans.) I'm gonna getcha good!\\", \\"I'm outta here!\\", \\"In my car\\" and for the biggest number of the night with a spectacular finish \\"Rock this county!\\". 5 out of 5 stars goes to the stage director, great lighting, great platform and love the small fire works that are set off during the concert, it is a very good stage for Shania and her great band. This concert is a MUST for any Shania Twain fan or if you have never listen to her before you are missing out on a great concert and performer/entertainer. For those of you that are Shania fans this concert is a great place to capture pictures on your computer of her doing what she loves to do. Down to the DVD well that is the only disappointing thing about it, I give no stars for the special features, 1.5 out of 5 stars for the front and back cover pictures (they are not good, I have got better pictures of her and her band myself from the same concert.), no 16:9 widescreen and NO DTS what is going on here? The Dolby 5.1 channel sound is ok but not good enough (It rates about 3.5 stars out of 5.) for Shania Twain, DD 5.1 track is still a bit cut down, her voice is beautiful but sadly is not shown or herd in it's true form has if it was professionally mix in DTS 5.1 surround sound. Shania's voice is spread too much into the left and right front speakers and not enough in the centre speaker were it should be. Sadly I feel that this release of her first on stage performance in 3 years on DVD is an insult to Shania Twain, she is a sweetheart and deserves a state-of-the-art DVD not some cheap DVD release, Shania Twain UP! Live in Chicago needs to be re-released on DVD again in DTS and offer way more special features. I must thank Shania's husband \\"MUTT\\" for helping her make great music. All-in-all this DVD is highly recommended.
B0001AP12G|5.0|This is a pretty hot album.  The best song on it is #4, \\"all falls down\\", as well as #2, #6, #19, and #21, which is a bonus song.  New Workout plan is also very good, and i don't know why Slow Jamz is on this album as well, but it's a slightly different version so at least it's a change.  There are too many skits on this album which is a downfall, but some are pretty funny.<br />The album follows through with the theme, which is rare these days, and that makes it good in some ways and bad in others.  Still it's a very good cd.  I couldn't wait for Kanye West's debut to drop, and i wasn't disappointed.  Definitely worth picking up.
B000088E6D|5.0|Wonderful. For one who loves the smooth voice of Dean Martin & Sinatra. For those who wanted longer updated versions of classic songs like moondance, sway and the way you look tonight. I've been waiting for years for this type of music to resurface. True singer, true music.
B0001AP12G|4.0|If you're looking for an album that's high on good humor and tight production you got it, but if you're looking for good lyrical content then look elsewhere. Although refreshing in its topic choices, `College Dropout', is hindered from the beginning by Kayne West's insistence on being the main MC of the album. Plain and simple, KAYNE WEST IS NOT AN MC! If he had the good sense to let the real MCs do their thing, like Dr. Dre on `Chronic' and `2001', this would be a more complete album. <br />For a quick compare with other producer/MC albums `College Dropout' is better than P. Diddy's  `No Way Out', about on par with Timbaland's `Tim's Bio' but not as well put together as Dr. Dre's `2001'. Like a very good joke, `College Dropout' is funny the first few times you hear it but grows to be rather tiresome after repeated play.<br />I hope that this album is a catalyst for change in Hip Hop and ushers in a new variety of artists. BUT if you want an album that doesn't just talk about pimps, hoes, and slamming Maybach doors, AND you still want HOT BEATS and HOT LYRICS. Here are a few sure-shots:<BR>Slum Village `Fantastic, Vol. 2' w/ production from JayDee, Little Brother `Listening' w/ production from Ninth Wonder, and Talib Kweli and Hi-Tek's `Reflection Eternal'<br />Album Breakdown:<BR>Highlight tracks are `Get Em High' featuring Talib Kweli and Common; `Two Words' featuring Mos Def, Freeway, and Harlem Boys Choir (although Kanye's verse is weak); an `Spaceship' featuring GLC and Consequence. Tracks by the 2 best known MCs on the album are rather weak: `Never Let Me Down' featuring Jay-Z and `Breathe In Breathe Out' featuring Ludacris. `The New Workout Plan' is funny; `Family Business' and `We Don't Care' are those nice feel-good songs; and `Slow Jamz' featuring Twista and Jamie Fox keeps the club action flowing. The album is def slowed down by the 6 skits and a track where Kanye talks about his life for a tiring 12 minutes.
B00005AQE8|5.0|I am certainly not a huge fan of rap. I listen to death/black metal like Meshuggah, In Flames, Death, Cradle of Filth, Shadows Fall and other metal like Killswitch Engage. 2pac's &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot; is definately one of the best albums ever made. It's the only album that's actually made me appreciate rap, and its the only one I can listen to without throwing up. In fact, I love listening to this. This album is brilliant!<br />Best Track: Got My Mind Made Up (Kurupt's delivery is outstanding)
B000005RYQ|5.0|This is one of the greatest &quot;Greatest hits&quot; compilations that I own in any music category. However, in this genre I must admit they don't come like this anymore. I seldomly listen to this genre of music (unless it's on the radio) but when I do you bet the police is one of cds in the cd changer.  This group has earned their infamous reputation and this compilation is just a summary of their excellence. All their top hits are included most likely based on popularity. I like all but one. So if you are considering buying just one Police album for your collection this one would be ideal. It also brings back great memories of great era in music.
B00014X8KO|3.0|I think many people have written about the virtues of the films, <BR>I would like to comment on the digital mastering,This has been a favourite movie of mine for some time and I have been waiting for a R1 release the Japanese version was far too expensive.I was expecting a remastering job of the Quality that was done on Akira,<BR>and I expected the result to be breathtaking,(especially on Magnetic Rose)I opened the package put the disc in ,and to my disdain ,the video looks like a rather clean laserdisc print, there is no evidence of 720\480 resolution of dvd it looked more like 352/480<BR>of half d1 resolution.most of the time the lines on the characters facial detail , in mid shots are all smudgy ,overall it has a washed out look ,no deep blacks either,I am appalled ,one of the most beautiful films had to get a shoddy transfer like this.I have seen it on a 36 inch widescreen hdtv in 480p mode through a progressive scan player.this confirms my suspicion that the japanese directors are not approving the final transfers for the r1 discs, A similiar case was the movie Jin-roh, Another case of a beautiful film done to death by a smudgy low res transfer.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|This is the first GREAT I have heard in a while. Being a U2 fan, I am not easily impressed, because no one does it as well as they do. But let me tell you, Gavin DeGraw has arrived, and what I hear tells me he could be around for a LONG time. Anyone who says this album is bad is not someone I care to know. <br />Best tracks:<br />Meaning, I Don't Wanna Be, Chariot, and Follow Through. Yes, I know that last one is a single, BUT I am totally serious. It is a classic song. <br />I haven't heard him live yet, but he has one of the best voices (in the studio) I have ever heard.
0385504209|5.0|After watching this book stay on the bestseller list for month after month, I decided to finally discover for myself what this book was about. And boy was I surprised. Although the characters are fictional, the historical events and people are real. This book allowed me to see Christianity in a different light. But I am skeptical as to how much of it is true. Many of the reviewers of this book complain that the book is full of inaccuracies and mistakes, but I thought it was a great read. It's fiction, albeit historical fiction, but what did some of the readers expect when they opened a work of fiction? Fact? I hope not. All I know is that I couldn't put this book down until I finished it. I found it interesting, informative, and suspensful. That is probably what Dan Brown intended the book to be and that is what I got from it. And for that, it was worth my time and money.
0316666343|5.0|I just loved this novel and ingested it quickly through alternating tears and smiles.  While it's a study in grief, &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; is also sweet and hilarious and completely worthwhile.  Anyone who has suffered the loss of a loved one might find both comfort, familiarity and a bit of humor in Alice Sebold's world for Susie Salmon (&quot;like the fish&quot;).  To me, this was similar to &quot;Ordinary People&quot; - a required text for a college course I once took on grief and loss. I'm passing it on to my friends and will recommend it to anyone who asks.
B0001611DI|5.0|One of the best Horror movies in history, that after every viewing leaves you wondering what would i do if i was in this hellish situation in a fight for survival, with no bounderies and no laws, and staying alive is as good as it gets?  Get this one now, it will make you think! (Plus the amazon Gore effects that add to the overall brutal atmosphere)!
B00005JLR6|5.0|\\"In America\\" is in many ways like a dream; and in some like a nightmare. It tells its story in such a peaceful, idyllic manner that it is easy to miss the desperation and pathos of this very real story of immigrants coming to the US with big dreams and bigger hearts.<br />Johnny (Paddy Considine), Sarah (Samantha Morton), Christy (Sarah Bolger) and Ariel (Emma Bolger) sneak into the US and land in the wilds of NYC: all of them eager and open to realize their dreams of a better life. They have somehow escaped Ireland and are trying to get over the accidental death of a son, Frankie and like most families they are dealing with the death in their own way. Johnny tries to hide his desolation and guilt by rushing about in a frenzy of work but in the penultimate scene of the film screams out: \\"I'm a Ghost!\\" I can't feel anything, I can't even cry.\\"<br />Samantha Morton is a bundle of motherly love and devotion yet within her huge eyes you can see that she is also masking a deep and relentless guilt. Sarah and Emma Bolger are luminous and real and neither strikes an unnatural chord throughout.<br />\\"In America\\" is a visual and graphic poem about Love and about Family. It is truthful and honest and doesn't shy away from the seamier side of life nor does it fail to acknowledge the emotionally aware and open spirit of we Americans: all of us immigrants at one time or another.
0385504209|3.0|Not a bad read.  The story flowed quite nicely, until the final 3rd of the book, that's when it really slowed down to a snail's pace.  Intruiging nontheless.  Worth the read.  Do your own research and you be the judge. That's what I am doing right now, researching on pagan gods and rituals.
0876855575|5.0|At one point in this book, the main character has started a reading mission by going to the library, picking out books (mainly the \\"classics\\") and reading them frantically. Later on he comments on these \\"classics\\": \\".....they are all a massive pretentious pomp about not much\\". Now, that is a heavy, ultraheavy statement to make when it comes to \\"classics\\". While i have the same opinion i also think that if you're going to deliver a hardcore critique like that you better be able to back it up. Bukowski does so in an overwhleming way not only in this (autobiographical) novel but basically in all his books.<br />     The thing about Bukowski is that his writting is so direct, so mercilessly direct in fact, that you feel more like watching a film rather than reading a book.<br />      Take the story in \\"Ham on rye\\" for example: this story for all intends and purposes is not an extraordinary story. By no means. Stories about poverty or growing up in financially dire times (like the 30s in America) can be found aplenty. Stories about abusive or clueless parents (or both) also abound in literature. Stories about discovering sexuality during teenagehood just as well. But in the end, no matter what the story, extraordinary or not, what matters is who tells it and how.<br />    Someone can start telling you the most incredible story and still fail to grab you with it. Bukowski could be talking for 4 pages about some \\"chick\\" he saw working as a clerk somewhere and the fantasies he has about her and you'll be totally engulfed in reading it. Or, he could be describing something as mundane as a football game and the bravado involvd in it and you'll feel like being right there standing next to a linebacker and due in for a hard hit.<br />    All this is intimidating and charismatic enough but when Bukowski spices it all up with his cynical and ruthless humour the sum is almost always a masterpiece.<br />   I've read quite some of his novels and regardless of the theme what always gets me is the power of his narrative. This guy can be compared to an elite few in that sector and those few would have very little to do with \\"classics\\" but more with writers who came straight from the underground of their time and who have the gift of being able to take in every important detail of what they are observing.<br />    \\"Ham on rye\\" is basically Bukowski growing up in the 30s while a crisis is at its peak, with a father who has made it a mission to beat him up systematically so he can become \\"worthy\\", a mother who's as clueless as your nearest wall, and a case of horrible acne (the \\"worst on the planet\\" he says) which condemns him to outsiderdom . But acne or no acne, Bukowski was an outsider anyway. He never \\"fit-in\\" exactly because he was beyond most of the people around him. He saw things they never saw and grasped things they never even suspected they were there for the grasping.<br />   It's also about a young Bukoswki discovering the opposite sex, and the drive that basically makes this planet go round, and it's simoultaneously a young Bukoski forming his first sociological conclusions which -predictably- are quite detached from the mainstream.<br />    If you've never read this author start here. It might be widely under discussion what his best novel is, but thsi one is one that easily combines all his talents in a hilarious, often explosive and then again bitter package. Those who claim that once you read \\"Ham on Rye\\" you'll want to read all his novels are absolutely dead on.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Yo this disc is just as good as Biggie's Born Again Disc.  Maybe better.  Kayne in my opinion shud be 1 of da greatest rappers eva.  I think he betta than Jay Z cuz he can touch people's lives.  He raps about things that people cud relate to, unlike some cash money or 50 cent song dat talks about money and cars.  Not every body has those things and Kayne defenently shows dat he feel every body dat has been in his position be4 on songs such as spaceship.  <br />Favorite Songs:<br />10.  We Don't Dare<BR>9.

B00005JMJ4|1.0|Waste of time, one of those movies where you keep watching, telling yourself &quot;10 more minutes, I'll turn it off it doesn't start to get good&quot;.  And you don't listen, and you keep watching, and you dozzzzzzzzzzzzze off knowing you are not missing anything substantive.  And those who agonizingly stayed awake, through vigorous caffeine stimulation, tell you upon your awakening that it never got better.  It stayed bad.  Very bad, very low budget.  Like $50. budget.  Like &quot;Thin Red Line&quot;, well, not that bad, but close!  And you awake, knowing you were the wiser for getting some rest instead of wasting time on this flick!
B000063DFS|5.0|No matter what decade, his music is always widely cherished and loved by fans all over the world. He is truly a rock and roll rebel. Rock on Ozzy! This album as well as many others, will always stand the test of time.
B00019074O|5.0|This is a really hilarious film that will keep you laughing.  Great performances by Steve Guttenberg, G.W. Bailey, and of coarse, Michael Winslow.  My favortites in this film are Larvell Jones (Michael Winslow) a person who can make the sound of everything he sees, Eugine Tackleberry (David Graf) a man who is totally obssesed with guns, and Dougles Fackler (Bruce Mahler) a man who causes accidents and riots and doesn't even know it.  I'm glad they're finally bringing out a 20th anniversary edtion, but the best part of it is, all the Police Academy films will be on dvd.  You can buy them seperat, or in a great box set that has all seven films in it.  The whole series will be realesed on dvd April 6.  This film will have a commentary, trailer and a docementary.  The commentary will be by actors Steve Guttenberg, Micheal Winslow, Leslie Easterbrook, G.W. Bailey, Director Hugh Wilson and producer Paul Maslansky.  So mark your calender for April 6, because Police Academy is coming to dvd.<BR>P.S. Just so you know, I'm sad to say, the actor who played Tackleberry, David Graf, passed away last year.  So I doubt there will be a Police Academy 8.
B00008NRL8|5.0|Since i got this CD for xmas, I've been playing it almost everyday at work. Every track stirs something inside that makes me want to dance a sexy dance of Tango.
B00005JMCN|5.0|This movie really captures the moment and your attention as well.  They really tell you what it was like when the first car was invented and how hard it was just to make it in the world of a family life.  This movie is also a wonderful peace of history and a great way to motivate anyone that thinks they can not achieve.  I have added this to my collection and would recommend it to anyone else looking for a really good movie.
0385510438|5.0|This book is not primarily about the law, as the title would suggest. Rather it traces the story of a small town newspaper publisher in the deep south in the 1970's.  It gracefully covers a variety of sujects including the influence of the church in small towns, race relations, the legal system, Vietnam, Southern food and drink. It repeats and, on occassion repudiates, various stereotypes--from crooked local sheriffs (true) to illiterate minorities (untrue). It is truly a pleasant read, and it fits together on a par with Grisham's best books. Highly recommended.

B00012QM8G|5.0|Is there anyone left who hasn't seen this one yet? See it!! <br />A story about a very ordinary guy, not a particularly \\"good\\" man, who ends up saving hundreds of people from Nazi concentration camps. While the Nazis around him grow increasingly inhuman in their indifference to the suffering they are causing, Schindler moves in the other direction, from an insensitive materialist to a man capable of seeing in these victims of persecution a common humanity. <br />The fact that this is based on a true story is enough to leave one filled with awe. The ending is fantastic. Great performances by wonderful actors all around.
B00005JMGC|5.0|Exquisite!  Truly a must see for all women age 13 and over, and for the men who love them.  A moving,  sophisticated, meaningful, and notable look at women and the complexities of women's issues in the 1950's, which are still highly relevant today.  The acting is compelling; the script is intelligent; and the cinematography, sets, and costume design are enchanting.  See it and gain a new appreciation of your mother or grandmother.  Enjoy!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This was one of the most ridiculous movies I have ever had the displeasure of watching.  Actually I shut it off after 1+ hours.  I must say that I now feel dumber thanks to having to witness this dumb as rock movie.
1410102033|1.0|Aside from the racist, xenophobic rhetoric, \\"Mein Kampf\\" is a difficult book to read. I didn't enjoy reading it and I was only too glad to get rid of it. <br />Hitler didn't write this book, rather, he dictated it to fellow Landsberg prison inmate Rudolf Hess. Consequently, \\"Mein Kampf\\" comes across as a heavy, meandering, disjointed piece of work that lacks intellectual integrity. It also reeks of narcissism and megalomania and, as such, much of what Hitler said should be taken with a grain of salt. <br />Historians will undoubtedly find it useful for studying the mindset of Hitler and how he used his rhetoric to seduce the German people and lead them to war and self-destruction. Other than that, there's not much to recommend this book and as far as I'm concerned, it should be thrown on the garbage heap of history.
B00005B3Z6|4.0|Having been a major fan of the American QAF, it was great recently to see the British.<br />Like a lot of folks have said, the initial story line is almost identical, just treated in a different way.  British is faster paced and funnier, especially after you get used to the Manchester working class slang.  But the faster pace keep the characters from having quite as much depth, although I like how the relationship between Stuart and Vince turns out more than Brian and Mike.  But I'm more of a romantic about stuff like that.<br />And the British is far more authentic in its approach to the working class culture.  The American boys claim Pittsburg working class roots, but they behave like middle class suburbans.<br />Overall though, I like the larger cast, more complex story and character development of the American version.  And there's nothing in the British that comes even close to the impact of the last show of season 1 American, especially for someone who's been through a similar situation as what happened to Justin.  That one episode did more to heal my old emotional pains than years of counselling could ever hope to!!  I also think the way the American told the story of Mike's 30th birthday was much better set up and followed through to a logical conclusion than Vince's 30th on the British.  If I hadn't seen the American, I probably would have missed the point on the British.<br />But all in all, the British is definitely worth having if you're into QAF.
B000003S09|5.0|Upon hearing this album when it first debuted, it was deemed somewhat actually intellectual, brillant, with emotion, and unique. With the CD release, in its various forms, still today, it it still the same. It is Concrete and Abstract in a World (Universe) without Form. And it is an album that you will listen to until you have ended, with death.<BR>Without going into the opening 21st Century Schizoid Man, where one can dance by bouncing around with the instrumental part in the middle, all in unison, all of you together now, and still sit if you want and listen to it, it pervades 'time' its self.<BR>The illumination of the album is staggering, in its concept.<BR>Easily while most people dismiss the Lonely MoonChild, it is perhaps, the best song of the album. Why, until you play it musically, do not muse yourself by drifting off in it, unless you are doing something else, while listening. Simply put, people start thinking during this song, about the negativity in their lives, and how they should be doing something. Therefore, I vote that this song, being as unique as it is, is actually referring to you as the listener, and as the Lonely MoonChild.<BR>I Talk to the Wind, is easily a physics class with parallel realities thrown in, and still is consistent with the modern view of physics to this day, and beyond. Your Epitaph, is easily about human's existence, and what will be the dilemma of your existence and the whole of humanity - forever!<BR>The Court of the Crimson King, is man, is the all of existence.<BR>All of the all of all is this album, and when it came out, people finally had something that related to everything called 'Life'.<BR>This, however, does not mean that the original band is viewed as 'God' but merely as it intended to be - Illumination, which is still needed from the Past, Present, and far into the Future, for I can not say, that people in the year 4555 will be listening to this album, but then again, they may just be listening, or they should!<BR>Now if you excuse me, I once again, listen to this album, for it never tires, never quits, is always there, and always will be - until my Epitaph!
B000089CJI|5.0|I bought this album on a whim, knowing only that Death Cab for Cutie's Ben Gibbard was a collaborator. I have absolutely NO regrets. I was totally blown away by this CD--it hasn't left my cdplayer/headphones/computer in over a month. <br />A little Duran Duran, maybe slightly Pet Shop boys, most definately a modern twist on new wave/synth pop. It has become one of my favorite albums. It is very rare these days to find music that can make you feel wonderful, nostaligic, gloriously happy, and meloncholy all in one go.
B000002H4Q|5.0|How ironic and funny that this group, most known for their own distinctive brand of depression rock, has made some of the most joyous, exuberant, overtly happy music I've ever heard (in particular, \\"Why Can't I B You?\\"). On this album, Robert Smith offers his heart on a platter even if it is typically tinged with melancholy.<br />KISS ME, KISS ME, KISS ME is so fun to explore and really highlights the Cure's eclecticism and wide range of talents. There are so many standout songs for me, but my favorite would have to be \\"Like Cockatoos\\" with a tricky, spiraling and masterful vocal from Smith and the bizarre sound of psychedelic birds in flight.<br />Also, if pressed, I would have taken off \\"Shiver and Shake\\" which is energetic, frazzled, nasty and angry but a bit of a throwaway while \\"Hey You!!!,\\" also a bit of a tossed-off tune, finds the Cure in full party mode which is a key aspect of this album. (\\"Hey You!!!\\" was removed so this double album could fit on one disc.)<br />Note: as brilliant as the Cure is, the biggest complaint I hear about them from my non-fan friends is Smith's vocals which are admittedly rather thin and crackly. However, if you can get past that, he is a very emotive vocalist and an excellent vocal stylist who can truly do some amazing things with his pipes. I really love his voice, faults and all!
0060516402|5.0|If You are tired of reading management books that are some fictions about how to build great company, that contain a lot of fancy drawings with bubbles, boxes and lines, bloated with buzzwords, but that has very weak/unclear/fuzzy link with the practice, then this book is for You. These guys (authors) have made a capacious 6 year methodical study project to find out why the top-performing companies in long-term perspective (long-term means they are looking at companies, not younger than about 50 years, which have been top-performes during most of their life-time) have succeeded. The study have revealed a lot of surprising facts (for example these results very clearly contradict some far-spread imaginations about good leadership).<br />Of course the authors still create some buzzwords and stuff, but these are only to facilitate telling the story of research results. I love easy to read nonfiction books with very strong and explicit link to real world practice, and this book is on top of them.<br />If You are acting in software development industry and are also interested in more short-term (less than 50 to 100 years of) management success, then You might want to read Detlev J. Hoch et al, &quot;Secrets of Software Success&quot; too -- the same review applies to it (except study project lasted for 4 years).
B000002UDB|5.0|This album is absolutely awesome. And neato. I like to listen to it lots. This has got to be my favorite Beatles album. Every song is perfect, specifically &quot;Blue Jay Way&quot; and &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot;. These are awesome songs. Everyone should own this album, because it is really cool. So, duh.
0679735259|2.0|Seems like the reviewers here either absolutely hate this book or absolutely love it. I personally couldn't make it past page 75, but not because the book was bad. It definitely has the stream of consciousness feel to it, but every other sentence left me thinking I was missing something. I kept thinking this would make sense if I had been there, so that all the jargon and insider references would have some meaning. I also got the impression Herr was stoned when he wrote it, which isn't a bad thing, just that again it left guys like me, who've never come close to experiencing war, it left me out. It also didn't help that I knew Herr was a reporter. Somehow that made his insider comments and feelings, and especially the overly dranatic passages seem fake. A LRRP writing the same thing would have come across completely different.<br />So my recommendation would be, if your a Vietnam Vet, this book is going to have deep meaning for you. But if you're not, and you're looking to somehow experience the experiences thru first hand accounts, you won't like it.  Get Rumor of War instead.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|A few weeks ago my girlfriend got this CD and lent it to me, usually I don't listen to POP, but this CD surprised me, it has very good beats and it was something I was totally not expecting. Pop lover or not, I bet my life this CD will satisify you
B00005JM02|4.0|Finding Nemo was one of last summer's big box office smashes and, given the success of past Pixar movies, and the cool image portrayed by this movie, it's easy to see why.  The story has Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks) trying to find his only son Nemo after he is scooped up by a scuba diver and forced to live in a dentist's aquarium.  Along the way Marlin meets with mild-mannered Dory (Ellen Degeneres), who can't remember things for more than a few minutes, but has a heart of gold.<br />And there we have it, a simple journey plot through the ocean, meeting weird and wonderful creations courtesy of the wonderful special effects at Pixar.  They really are incredible - the water effects especially are brilliant.  Remember when Monster's Inc came out and the big development was the minute details of Sulley's fur.  Well, this is even better technically.  However, there's a certain breed of familiarity here that makes you think that the people at Pixar are capitalising on their previous films' success, because Finding Nemo is probably the least distinguishable of the lot.  Of course, the Toy Story movies have already deservedly achieved classic status, but the key different between the previous Pixar movies and Finding Nemo is that they focus a lot less on the adult audience and more on the children.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, because as a kid's film Nemo is fantastic, and much more endearing than something like Shrek which, although good, was never really as layered as Toy Story.  For instance, all of the characters are endlessly endearing; from the cute little Nemo, to the lost Dory to Squirt, the baby turtle.  This isn't to say Nemo doesn't have its flairs.  There are a few more adult jokes along the way, not least a group of sharks professing that fish are friends and not food, desperately trying to rid themselves of their stereotypes.  The turtles using 'surfer' talk are also very well observed.  Add to the mix a great turn by Willem Defoe as Gill, a hard-bitten aquarium fish who helps Nemo escape, Geoffrey Rush as a pelican, manic seagulls screeching 'Mine, Mine!' and you've got an effective engaging movie.  Still, it's a shame that every Pixar film will live with the shadow of its predecessor hanging over it, especially when this is a brilliant family movie, but the nagging resonance of the brilliant Toy Story is always in your head.
B00000IQC8|5.0|The highly talked about movie \\"Clerks\\" was an independent film that Kevin Smith funded with ten credit cards, by selling his comic book collection, money from an insurance claim, money from his friends, and from paychecks working at Quick Stop. I expected the film to be comedic, mostly because anything with Jay and Silent Bob is hilarious. Clerks started out at the IFFM (Independent Feature Film Market) where it was viewed and liked by Bob Hawk, a member of the Sundance Advisory Committee. It was then shown at Sundance in 1994 where Miramax Films picked it up. From there they did advertising.<BR> The movie is a comedy and has a relationship story with the main character caught between two girls. His old high school sweetheart and his current girlfriend. The movie is basically about Dante who is somewhat of a loser by society's standards. He works at a local Quick Stop and comes across several characters including Jay and Silent Bob. The love story is what holds the movie together and gives it some body. Without it the movie would have been a disaster. The movie gives you relaxed vibes and has a chilled out atmosphere about it, which is helped by the great soundtrack. <BR> The main characters are Dante, Randal, Veronica, Caitlin and Silent Bob. Jay (Jason Mewes) dances around like an idiot and sells drugs; Silent Bob (Kevin Smith), of course, just stands there. Dante (Brian O' Halloran) thinks he is really something special and that his job needs him. He thinks he's the only man for the job and things will fall apart without him. Randal (Jeff Anderson) recognizes that anyone can do their job and that they are just two losers working at a video and local liquor store. The acting isn't super but I think its meets the standards for an independent flick.<BR> This of course was Kevin Smith's first movie. He is also known for his other works titled, \\"Chasing Amy\\" and \\"Mallrats\\". The film does get somewhat slow during some parts, such as the love scenes but I think its somewhat unavoidable when it comes to those things. The film was all black and white with settings in the Video Store, the Quick Stop along with the roof, outside the Quick Stop and at Dante's House. Technical camera angles weren't really in effect due to the fact that it was an Independent film and released back in 1994.<BR>     All in all I enjoyed the film. The good points had to be the classic petty arguments and wide range of vocabulary used in Kevin Smith films and Jay's crazy antics. The only bad point for me was the black and white. Some people might like it but I'm a man of the color age. If your into comedy and you enjoy any of the other Kevin Smith films this movie is a must see!
B0000VAFO0|2.0|In fact, if you remove the fangs and claws and morphing werewolves, this is just another Matrix knock-off.  Guns, kicks, cars, phones, gizmos, leather outfits.  You almost expect Morpheus to appear to tell the story of the vampire-werewolf war from the beginning.<br />Well, of course, there's a touch of Romeo and Juliet, too, but don't they all?<br />the one refreshing angle here is that the vampires are surprisingly devoid of the powers of the popular modern vampire.  If one can ignore their uppity leather outfits and obvious good looks, they are almost a throwback to the earlier (medieval) vampires of Eastern Europe, before Bram Stoker invented \\"Dracula\\". They don't fly, they don't shape-shift, they can't even smell an ambush in a train station, an ambush by werewolves, no less. (I mean, if werewolves used to be servants of vampires as the story tells, then vampires should at least know how 'wolves smell.) they seem to have normal senses, relying a lot on electronic sensors and cameras to monitor their homes for intruders.  in terms of pure ability, the werewolves definitely outclass the supposedly superior vampires.<br />not that there are no nice touches. the way they fall from above, landing on one knee and then immediately getting up and walking off, is quite cool.  kate beckinsale lends some credibility to her character, but the rest of the vampires are just aristocrats in leather posturing for the cameras.  even here, the werewolf actors steal the show, although the lead one doesn't.<br />ending almost hints at a sequel, but to what end?
B00002E224|5.0|\\"Before Sunrise\\" is a realistic dialogue of two college aged young adults that meet by \\"chance\\" on a train in Austria/Germany/Hungary.  Ms. Delpy is the one of the romantic leads, paired with American actor Ethan Hawke.  Her role as the emotionally mature and aware young woman on holiday, finishing a visit with her grandmother, is not only refreshing, but should send EVERY young man's heart aflutter.  Ethan Hawke is the young man, that has just finished a disasterous meeting and break-up with his American girlfriend in Europe, and aimlessly \\"bumps\\" into Ms. Delpy's character on the train.  After an initial meeting, that realisically portrays the most charismatic scences of love at first meeting, the couple spend the next 90 minutes developing not only their characters, but the most sincere<BR>portrayals of feelings ever seen on film.  A real sleeper.  Though eight years old as a movie, this movie's emotions, intensity, and realism shall never age.  Definitely buy or rent this movie.  E-mail me and tell me what you think.
B00018D44U|4.0|The more you listen to this album, the more you will like it.  I'll admit that at first, it sounded like one hour-long song.  But after listening to it a few times, the wide range of styles differentiate themselves on the various tracks.  It's truly a genre-defying album.  There is more country in this offering than there was in Come Away With Me, but Miss Jones sounds very comfortable with it.  In fact, the country-flavored tracks really shine, while the so-called &quot;jazz&quot; tunes fall flat.  (Don't Miss You At All is aptly named.)  All that said, the best tracks are: the simple, strong and tender &quot;Humble Me&quot;; the upbeat &quot;Creeping In&quot; with Dolly Parton singing in wonderful harmony; the mellow and sweet &quot;Long Way Home&quot;; and the bluesy, almost soulful &quot;What Am I to You?&quot;.  By the way, the production seems top-notch to me.  The instrumentation is gorgeous; it is the perfect complement to Miss Jones' heartfelt singing.  And I listen on my computer.  So there.
B00006879E|5.0|When i first heard maroon 5 i thought that they were cool, but i didn't really bother to really listen to harder to breathe. Then i heard &quot;This Love&quot;, their second single, and i was a fan. I have the cd and its different from anything else out there now. It's a kind of rock fused with r&amp;b. The lyrics are about love, heartache, etc. There's something about the lead singers voice that draws you into the song and gives it that extra &quot;kick&quot;. Good stuff.
B000002UVX|5.0|The Band of Gypsies is the greatest rock album ever made.<BR>--that's my opinion.  I first heard it in 1971 and still play it.<BR>I never seem to get tired of it.  What gets me, is most people still don't know about it!!  But that's not surprising--it never got any air time on the radio.  The Band of Gypsies is Jimi's true masterpeice--greater than any of his albums with The Experience.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|Now, how many of us have actually experienced love in real life the way actors and actresses portray it in films? Love actually brings together a very potent mix of comedy and romanticism into its whole state of affairs. You get several situations in this film all of which are connected to love and that of course is the main ingredient. Set in the very English environment you get the best of everything. The characters are excellent on their own, from the prime minister of Britain to the lonely office girl downtown, to the fading rock star, love is simply all around. What makes this movie special is the down to earth element that simply decides to sell well. Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Kiera Knightly, Martine McCutcheon, Alan Rickman, Laura Linney, Bill Nighy and Rowan Atkinson all come together to deliver one excellent holiday movie, in a very long time, not to forget the excellent soundtrack to boot.
0887307280|5.0|Without this book, I surely would have been one of the statistics that made costly mistakes that would have put me out of business within the first couple of years.  I watch small businesses fail around me constantly while I flourish, and I owe it all to following the advice in this book.  I give this as a gift to anyone who is opening a business, thinking of opening a business, or who owns or manages a business and is having difficulty.  This is a must-read for every entrepreneur, and also served me well as a corporate vice president previous to owning my own business.  Thank you Michael Gerber, wherever you are!!
B00004XONN|5.0|Last night before I went to bed, in a drunken stupor, I decided to borrow this album off my friend because i was staying in his apartment and we had just argued over its merits for hours. I reminded him -as if he needed to hear me moan again- of how lonely i have been feeling in kid a's absence ever since it was borrowed indefinitely off me some time ago. I also reminded him of my theory that it is the best album ever recorded. So i fully expected to listen to it and and have my theory shattered. This is usually how it works for me. I say an album is great, tell everyone about it, listen to it again and realise that no, actually, it's pretty bland really, not much point in ever listening to it again. so i stuck on the cd, listened to about three bars of everything in its right place, and fell asleep. About five hours later i woke up in a bad state, sparked up a cigarette and lay in my sleeping bag, warm and cosy, wondering what was in my discman, and why i was in a sleeping bag. I took out the cd and listened to it, smiling immediately because, well, that's what you do when yoy hear Everything in its Right Place, unexpectedly. As i listened to the album, on my earphones, i was shocked at how much stuff i had never heard before. I have had this album for three and a half yars. I taped most of it off the radio before it had been released. I bought it the day it came out. By God, ive sweated it out with this album, and thought i had noticed every single one of its micro-subtleties, its distant melodies, its subliminal rhythms. But no. There was more. A lot more. It was still revealing itself to me. Kid A and I are still &quot;getting to know&quot; each other.<BR>Like a person you love, Kid A continues to reveal itself after years. There is no end to its ability to affect emotionally. It is simultaneously self and other, us and them, inside and outside, distant and close,smooth and jagged, abstract and irrational, man and machine, <BR>It is the Ulysses of the popular music world. It is encyclopaedic in its scope of influence and transmission. Its range is greater than that of any other music out there. It does not take as its basis an ideal of anti-rock, a rejection of its roots. It merely subordinates rock because Radiohead had grown out of rock. <BR>Kid A gave me a lesson in music. When i got this album i was a rather typical geeky seventeen year old rock fan. I listened to Zeppelin, The Doors, Cream, Black Sabbath, The Velvets. I needed something to wake me up, to challenge me, to make me grow aurally. And this did it. I arrange my music autobiographically (like in High fidelity, in the order in which i bought it) and it is fascinating to see how much my taste broadened simply because of Kid A. <BR>Like Ulysses did with the novel as concept, Kid A takes the album to its limit. It is completely incoherent, it meanders, there is no connection at all between any two pieces on it, no two tracks would fit into the same genre. (compare the juxtaposition of The National Anthem with how to disappear Completely.) Yet would you ever skip a track? Do you ever ask yourself... why isn't that track there, not here (as you probablly do with everything on Amnesiac)<BR>Sometimes i think that this album is a compilation tape of instrumental music that johnny made for himself (entitled &quot;Never to be played in public&quot;) Somehow Thom stole it and decided to cut and paste snippets of his daily conversations on top, just for the laugh, to see how it would go, and so he called it &quot;You're Kidding.&quot; Then Ed came along and said, that's a silly name for your album, guys, why don't you shorten it to &quot;Kid A?&quot; (Yes, Ed does input by times.) And so Kid A was born.<br />Most people i know don't really get this album. That makes sense, it really is not accessible to most people. I was delighted the other day when doing a sound check for a play i was acting in, set in a mental institution, the sound engineer played the intro to Kid A(the track) at the end of the play. No one else had ever heard anything like it. They were shocked. They loved it, but were dumbfounded. And I smiled. Radiohead are weird, they aren't easy, you should be shocked. This is art. This is the highest form of existence. This is a fusion of psyches. When i hear Kid A, I am Radiohead. I am inside the music, yet i am outside it. I am machine, it is man. There is no difference.<BR>If Kid A only does one thing, it is to dispel the myth that technology is inherently inhuman, lifeless. Much of what i hate about the world is technology and its influence. I am suspicious of it, i fear its power. But this album gives me hope. It makes me realise that yes, man and machine can work in harmony to produce beauty. They can be fused together, they can make life better, not just faster.<BR>Finally Kid A will be remembered. In 100 years time when rock and roll is being taught in classrooms, this will be on the curriculum. It will be remembered as the first great Twentyfirst century classic text. All i hope though is that it is not universally loved, so that people in future generations can fight and scream at each other over its merits, just like i did last night.
B00005NVDI|1.0|These two episodes are so bad that fans are looking for something to say and find the &quot;Batman&quot; connection with the guest stars (Meriwether &amp; Groshin).  Yechh!!!  Holy Pork Fat, Batman!<br />But on a postive note, &quot;That Which Survives&quot; could have been so much more if they only bothered to do a few more rewrites.  The stark cheap sets on that episode didn't even stick out!  Well, maybe when Kirk told Spock to fire at the 'computer' and the unnamed Lt. fired at the 'cube' hanging from the ceiling, which made no sense at all!  And that's with the full-length original episode.  It looks like they edited something important out of the story, or more probably just ran out of time.<br />On a negative note, Let That Be Your Last Battlefield was a poor excuse of a 'moral story' about prejudice.  The plot had some stupid points (left side, right side skin color) while it clobbered you over the head with the lesson, the home planet destroyed itself!  Long gone are the 'morals' being nested in a good story.  <br />p.s.  Will Amazon ever allow us to give out a zero rating?
0783225733|5.0|Apollo 13 is an exciting film about a trip to the moon, filmed \\"documentary style\\" as if it really happened. of course the whole thing was faked, and here's why-<BR>Facts about the Moon<br />An average days temperature on the moon ranges from 260° F to 280° F, too for film to survive. At those temperatures, film crinkles up into a ball.<br />About 20 miles about the Earth, there is a radiation belt named the Van Allen belt. No human can get through this belt, If you try than you get hit with 300+ rads of radiation. Unless they are surrounded on each side by 4 feet on lead.<br />There are millions of micro-metors traveling at speeds up to 6000 MPH, which would tear the ship to pieces.<br />If you look at the pictures/video of people on the moon, you will never see more than 3 stars.<br />When the LEM set down on the Lunar surface, it gave out 3000 lb. worth of thrust. This would have created a massive hole underneath the Lunar Module, but in pictures of the Lunar Module, the ground underneath is untouched.<BR>But why would they do it?<br />I have come up with three reasons why NASA would fake a landing on the moon:<br />MONEY. NASA gathered about 30 billion dollars pretending to go to the moon. That means that someone is getting a lot of money in their pockets.<br />ATTENTION. If you ever saw the movie \\"Wag the Dog\\", the president has sexual relations with a 12 year old. This information goes out to the media 1 week before elections. So, to get the publics mind off of the little Girl, the president stages a war with Albania. The moon shots were the same concept. People did not like what was going on with the Vietnam war, so, to get the publics mind off of all the bad things going on in Vietnam, the US faked a moon landing. If you check your dates, we abruptly stopped going to the moon around the same time the Vietnam War Ended. (<br />TO WIN THE SPACE RACE -- Back in the late 60's early 70's, Russia and the US were in a heated battle to see, well, pretty much who was better. Once the US realized that they couldn't send a man to the moon, they couldn't just say, \\"OK Russia, we give up.\\"<br />I recommed this movie if you are able to forget all the facts and just enjoy a well told story.
B00005QTAR|4.0|The Savage Curtain is one of the strangest and most absurd episodes of the 3rd seaon.  While providing some more background on Vulcan it parades through a lengthy battle scene that is sure to put the most dovish people to sleep.  I'm not advocating violence for violence sake but it wouldn't have hurt here.<br />All Our Yesterdays has its share of stupidity as well.  Kirk and Spock haven't learned anything from all their previous voyages by they way they act in this story. 'Leap before you Look' is the theme here.  Maybe Spock's behavior is poorly explained but this story led to one of my favorite Trek novels Yesterday's Son and its follow up Time For Yesterday. 4 stars on that alone.
B000002H70|5.0|At the time of the recording of Disintegration, the Cure were just beginning to be noticed in the U.S. as a result of several minor hits off of their \\"Kiss me, Kiss me, Kiss me\\" album in the late 80s.  1989, the year Disintegration was recorded and released, was not a particularly good year in Robert Smith's life, so he naturally wasn't going to be making music akin to the poppy, upbeat, Kiss me, Kiss me, Kiss me sound.  When he first played the new album in front of a test audience, it was met with some mild applause, but mostly disappointing silence.  Smith thought he'd committed career suicide and had chosen the worst possible way to follow Kiss me, Kiss me, Kiss me.  Little did he realize at the time that he and his band had created a masterpiece, which would go on to be the Cure's best-selling album as well as my favorite album of all time.<br />From the majestic opening of \\"Plainsong\\" to the closing chords of \\"Untitled\\", Disintegration is a beautiful, very cohesive masterpiece.  Lush keyboards, soothing bass lines, complex drum patterns, and absolutely amazing guitar lines create a beautiful, melancholic atmosphere that totally envelops the listener.  Backing it all up are Robert Smith's reedy, plaintive vocals, which are phenomenally emotional, passionate, and sincere.  With few exceptions, the songs on Disintegration hover for gorgeously extended lengths of time, taking their time to unravel and inspire awe.  Every single one of them is wondrous work of art, and their consistency in quality and theme is amazing.  The album is 72 minutes long, and there is not one minute of filler.  That statement, plus the fact that this album has only received three negative reviews out of 197, should speak volumes about the quality of Disintegration.<br />This album is simply the best thing I've ever heard.  If you have patience, an open mind, and the desire to experience something simply and utterly beautiful, Disintegration is for you.

B00005JMTQ|1.0|Chick flick?  This flick made this chick sick.  I am a 49 year old woman and went to this thinking it would be great to see two of my favorite stars together.  Wrong.  I couldn't wait to get out of the theater and sat there with my arms folded waiting to at least crack a smile, which never happened.  And that stupid crying scene - another reviewer was right, they knew each other a week and slept together one night and that was enough to cause hysterics?  I was embarrassed for Diane Keaton and bored senseless.  To me, Keanu Reeves was the best thing about this movie, I don't understand all the negative reviews about him.  He could just stand there and not say a word and be better than Jack and Diane were in this movie.  And to the reviewer who said the movie took place on \\"Cape Teddy Kennedy\\", sorry, you're wrong, it took place in the Hamptons in NY (stated more than once).  Ted and Co are on Cape Cod in Massachusetts.  Where all of us nice liberals live...
6305882592|5.0|Here is a film that I just cannot get enough of, and, I fear, is grossly misunderstood by far too many people.  A love story like no other, an inspired lesson in self-awareness and fearlessness in self-expression - this may fall into the \\"cult\\" department, but should be seen by all.<br />Unfortunately, the extreme May-December romance of Harold and Maude raises eyebrows to the point that many see only this aspect of the film - \\"Oh my God he slept with an 80-year-old woman oh my God\\" - but in actuality, this has so little to do with the film's message.  It points out that love comes in all shapes and sizes, and most often when we least expect it.  Also, that a friend of any age can open us to seeing the world in a new, more truthful light.  Harold begins as an introverted, unhappy young man, whose only creative outlet consists of tormenting his image-obsessed, utter snob of a mother (thus forming the most hilarious visuals for the viewer).  After meeting with Maude, his world rapidly opens to new discoveries, and a greater understanding of his fellow human beings.  If you have any kind of heart, the final sexual union (relax, folks - we don't see the details) between Harold and Maude doesn't offend - rather, it warms the heart and soul.<br />The DVD offers a few treats - theatrical trailers, and, well, a great print.  I feel that this is a definite must-own... it is truly an amazing film.
0743244249|3.0|Right about the time I polished off &quot;Underworld&quot; for the third time, this new tome by the same author comes along.  At just over 200 pages, I figured this would be a quick way to get some more DeLillo under my belt before I tackled any of his early works.  I figured wrong.<br />&quot;Underworld&quot;, for all it's brilliance, contained numerous dull passages, often of a rather lengthy nature, many of them made dull by seemingly motiveless characters who wandered around performing inexplicable acts of minimal consequence, all in the name of some presumable Big Statement that never coalesced.  BUT, and it's a big but (note the caps!), there were a superior number of masterful plot threads that were successfully brought to fruition, and it was these latter threads that not only saved the novel but made it one of the best published in the last ten years (I say this, of course, not having read much genre fiction, but if that's your bag you're probably not reading this review anyway).<br />The problem with &quot;Cosmopolis&quot; can be summed up rather succinctly:  it contains all of the drawbacks of &quot;Underworld&quot; without any of the payoffs.  The lead character, Eric Packer, never clicks with the reader, even though all the Big Statement elements inherent in this plot are telegraphed way in advance (hell, the stretch limo on the cover just about says it all, and considering DeLillo is no minimalist that's not a good sign).  The symbolism of having a disenfranchised ex-executive plotting to assassinate Packer also seems a bit obvious a ploy for someone as skilled in sketching out characters as Delillo.  <br />&quot;Cosmopolis&quot; is further burdened by a long laundry list of non-events that make up the plot and offer little resolution;  a scene toward the end where Packer bursts into tears at a rapper's funeral seems to come out of nowhere, and nothing in the narrative up to that point has sufficiently illustrated the kind of growing remorse that leadsto the inexplicable final quarter of the book.  Nonetheless, believeable or not, once it's been made clear that Packer has growned disillusioned with his world to the point of self-destruction, the novel's denouement seems not only obvious but inevitable.<br />All in all, not one of Delillo's finer works.  In fact, this is exactly the type of book where you can get a good idea of it's quality from reading reviews.  You can never agree with any one critic 100% of the time, but when a universal cross section of write ups all point to the same pros or cons of any given work it's about as good advice as you're going to get prior to reading the book for yourself.  Which is indeed recommended, but in the case of Delillo and &quot;Cosmopolis&quot; do yourself a favor and save this one for last.
0783226063|3.0|I was disappointed in the fact that several scenes were absent from the DVD including the gom jibbar sequence early in the movie.  Some of the deleted scenes contained important plot points.  If the viewer has not seen the intact version of this movie he/she will be lost.
B000002UB3|5.0|Of course this is a fine album to go out on - coherent, rocking and defiant.  Who can doubt that? - certainly not Banned and Censored or whatever your real name is. I like your humour - It's just a pity that others can't appreciate it in the way it was intended.  The star you award is appropriate perhaps to the whole voting and self-congratulatory culture that we find here.  Still, Abbey Road is a landmark, and will remain so regardless of worthy opinions.
B00018D44U|5.0|I bought this for my husband's birthday and he loved it! Didn't think it was his style, but he so much enjoyed her other cd, that I had to buy this one for him!  It's a lovely compilation!
B000022TSW|5.0|For those who are sensitive to foul language, this is the worst movie you've ever seen. For those who are able to look beyond the vulgarity and find the social commentary in this movie, this is perhaps the best (and certainly the funniest) movie you'll ever see in your life!
B00008NG5V|5.0|'On and On' took about a month of play to really grow on me. A tremendous fan of Jack's previous release, 'Brushfire Fairytales,' I was a little skeptical when I first listened to this album. Mostly, I thought that several of the songs could've been lengthened, even if it was just another verse and a chorus. But after playing it, the songs started to differentiate from one another and stand out. I no longer doubt this album because the CD just seems to build momentum as the songs progress. And the CD is rather enjoyable for Jack's social commentary. Ranging from our cultural materialism to air pollution, 'On and On' serves as both a lament an exhortation for personal responsibility (see 'Cookie Jar'). Overall, the album is a great disc to just slide in the player and let it go. I say go get it.

0385504209|5.0|Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code takes readers to factual places and exposes him to the art world. For someone who has very limited knowledge of the art world like me, Brown's clever story about Robert Langdon, as he searched for the legendary Holy Grail, will keep readers glued to their seats. His mastery of the written word, the suspenseful ambiance, the unexpected and surprising twists are elements that great thriller movies are made of!<br />The novel, whether there are many inaccuracies and fallacies as some claim, is a gem in itself. It has all the right elements that make reading an enjoyable hobby. The Da Vinci Code is unlike the typical conspiracy theories novel in the market today. There are no sophisticated gadgets or technology nor aliens that want to wreak havoc on earth. It is about the most famous basis of all conspiracy theories, the motherlode of all--the Catholic Church.<br />Whether or not you are a devout Catholic, readers must see this novel as what it is--an enjoyable and gripping novel. I simply can't wait for the movie version!
B00003OO3O|4.0|I'm not sure what's going on on the cover, but inside is some impressive rock and roll and that's what counts.  Picking up where Phenomenon left off, Force It takes a big step forward toward the classic sounds of No Heavy Petting, Lights Out and Obsession with five instantly recognizable UFO classics, Let It Roll, Shoot Shoot, Out In The Street, Mother Mary and This Kids.  A great album, well worth the import price, but you're on you own if you leave it where your parents can see it.  I'd just as soon not think about it.
B00018TI5E|2.0|Wow, I've been a Frusciante fan for so long, and this album really let me down.  As someone who has preferred John's solo work over the Chili Peppers through the years--even if an album yielded only one or two listenable tracks (e.g., Smile From The Streets That You Hold)--many of these new songs sound bland and uninteresting to me.    For one thing, the production is completely different.  Where previous albums were recorded entirely by John on home-recording equipment, this album was engineered in a studio, with live drums and more of a standard band sound.  Sadly, the music in this format sounds homogenized and very average, including most of the guitar-work, strangely.   The strength of the songwriting is undone by too much production--a striking contrast from the minimalism of prior albums.

B00009L1TA|2.0|SOME of the acting is good, if you can overlooked the fact that the provost Marshal's accent comes and goes in every other scene, but the ending ruins a fair movie.<br />WIthout giving away the &quot;twist&quot; if you accept that the ending, then the entire rest of the film makes no sense what-so-ever.   If your one of those people who asks &quot;then why would he have done that?&quot;  DONT see this movie.
0800177975|5.0|Me and my friend watched this movie under the influence. It was so hilarious, the whole time we couldnt stop laughing. We couldnt tell what we were hullucinating or not.
B000002LRX|5.0|I bought this cd a few months ago but for some reason didn't listen to it until now.  I know, it's wrong, but I probably had a good reason.  Seeing all the positive reviews for this album and being a Faith No More fan myself I now see what I have done as committing some degree of sacrilege!  I am sorry.  <br />I have been a fan of Mr. Bungle and Faith No More for awhile now.  Although I am not as into Tomahawk and Fantomas as some, I do think both of those bands have some good stuff also.  I am not a huge fan of Patton's singing style but I must say the lyrics are amazing and should definately be read as you are listening along for the first or second time.   If you have never heard Faith No More before you are in for a treat, because they are nothing like you have ever heard before.  Some compare them to RHCP, which I can kind of see due to the fact that the bass lines are funky as hell and Patton sometimes sounds like Kiedis.  So if you like RHCP then definately look into this.  <br />Angel Dust is an amazing CD by FNM.  The vocals, guitar, bass, and drums blend together so well that it is hard to listen to one particular part; you just have to sit back a soak it all in.  There are a lot of effects and other instruments added in that flow beautifully with Patton and crew.  Some high points I think are definately &quot;Caffeine&quot;, &quot;Everything's Ruined&quot;, &quot;Land of Sunshine&quot;, &quot;Jizzlobber&quot; and &quot;A Small Victory.&quot;  One song I didn't care for was RV, which although not terrible, just isn't for me.  I prefer fairly formulaic song structure.  All in all this CD is amazind and I definately think that anybody interested in funk, metal, or anything eclectic should pick it up!  You won't be dissapointed.  <br />Also, if you ever get a chance to hear &quot;The Gentle Art of Making Enemies&quot; off of Who Cares A Lot? The Greatest Hits and King for a Day, Fool For a Lifetime, I would highly recommend it.  Nobody seems to talk about that song but it is my favorite by them.
0385512104|5.0|Meet Chirstopher Boone.  Christopher Boone is autistic, and they use the familiar euphemism of &quot;Special Needs&quot; for him. They explain they use such gentle terms, to avoid the hurtful words of the past, like &quot;spaz&quot; and &quot;crip,&quot; though Christopher doesn't quite understand how children chanting &quot;special needs&quot; is supposed to be any less nasty. But this is hardly a concern for Christopher, who is much more busy worrying about the nature of black holes and passing his advanced math exam to fret about such mundane things. And he has a mystery to solve, the mystery of whom impaled his neighbor's dog with a garden fork.<br />Christopher is the narrator of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, which is obstensibly his attempt at writing a mystery in the style of the Sherlock Holmes stories. Christopher is a great fan of Sherlock Holmes, as he can understand Holmes' deductive reasoning and Occam's razor, yet he dislikes Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, due to his belief in the afterlife and fairies. Yet his story is true, for he cannot understand fiction; if something is not true, it is a lie, and Christopher cannot lie, or understand those who do. And because real life, especially when people are involved, tends to veer off in unpredictable ways, the book turns out to be far more than a detective story. Christopher makes discoveries far more disturbing than simply who killed the dog, and ultimately paints a portrait of human weakness that is damning yet sympathetic.<br />Which is surprising coming from a narrator incapable of truly grapsing emotion. Which is, of course, the gimmick of this book, yet it does not take long to appreciate that this is far more than a gimmick. It has become a cliche for a simpleton to reveal the truth about the supposed-normal people, but this book is no Forrest Gump. Christopher is not, by virtue of his disease, able to transcend the dark side of human emotion, but is rather all the more vulnerable, unable to cope with the lies he discovers, because he has no empathy for those who tell them. A liar is a very dangerous person for Christopher.<br />Christopher does offer some insight into the human mind, though it is generally not a pretty picture. He reduces the vaunted ideals of human consciousness down to the notion of a humunculus watching a screen in our heads, like Captain Picard watching the big screen of the Enterprise; and surely this little man is just as much a creation of our imagination as Picard. Christopher has faith in science, but how far can the logic of the mind take us, when the creator of Christopher's literary hero is professing a belief in fairies and Ph.D.s can't fathom the Monty Hall problem.<br />The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is being called a funny book, and I suppose it is, to an extent. But it is also a dark and depressing work as well. Yet it does have some uplifting qualities; it is painful to watch Christopher struggle with the mysteries he discovers, which become far more personal than just who killed the dog. We feel for Christopher because we can see he does not have to tools to deal with the problems he faces. Yet he does deal, and is emboldened, in the end, by his achievements. And for the rest of us, who sometimes share Christopher's feeling of being overwhelmed, perhaps his achievements give us hope, too.
0140277447|1.0|Pictures in the book are faked and associated with the captions misleading readers. Every picture is not an evidence of the massacre. On the contrary, many pictures are no related to Nanking battle.<BR>First 5 pictures are obviously no proof of Chang's claim. As you can see, no explanation needed for that.<BR>Let's see 6th picture with the caption &quot;As the Japanese moved across China, they rounded up thousands of women. Many of them were gang raped or forced into military prostitution&quot;.<BR>The original of this picture was taken on Oct/14/1937. Chang had trimmed farmers (or peasants, I do not know) off the picture who are following the line with pulling the carts full of cotton wool. Also Chang had lowered the resolusion and made the graduation coarse enough for readers to be unable of reading their faces. You will be surprised if you look at the original.<br />People are smiling!
B00012QM8G|5.0|One is seized by the irony in this movie of the Schindler Jews who could die in concentration camps or be chosen to build war implements and related products for the German War Machine.<br />I was stunned when I saw this movie because when I was a very young child I knew a Schindler survivor not understanding the seriousness at the time of what he suffered.  This movie will make you cry and make you think.  The music is engaging, between the violin solo at the start and the song Jerusalem of Gold at the end where there is a tribute to those who survived and died, how powerful the combination of sadness and sorrow.<br />The movie is dark and being in Black and White, you feel the emptiness of the existence of prison life.  Finnes plays a rather heartless and cruel killer in the camp that is an ironic opposite of the open minded and tender hearted Schindler.  The irony and message in this movie seems to me to be that even though Germany of the day was controlled by an ideology so anti freedom and life, there existed many who did not agree with what was happening.<br />There are many subtle lessons in this movie, Ben Kingsley is outstanding in this film.  Most of all, Liam Neeson is believable as the business man turned savior.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|&quot;Lost in Translation&quot; continues Bill Murray's current fondness for taking offbeat, fitting, and somewhat less commercial (than his past) roles, in movies including this and Wes Anderson's &quot;Rushmore&quot; and &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot;. All have been beautifully made movies with perfectly acted roles by Murray, and &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is no exception. <br />This movie was one of a small group of movies (which I can count on one hand) that has left me with a real appreciation of the beauty that's possible in film, and in some ways, in life; It's also very funny, and I recommend it highly. However, it's apparently not for all tastes, despite it's beauty and hilarious moments. <br />It's apparently (based on several other reviews) not for those with short attention spans or without an appreciation for true cinema art, which this is. It is NOT boring, though, and it IS very funny. And I for one was cheering for Bill Murray during the Oscars. All in all, a great movie and another excellent longterm career choice for Bill Murray.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I loved Josh's first album and couldn't wait until his sophmore album came out.  This second album was better than I expected!  It blows away the first one.  Oceano, A Si Volverias A Mi and Hymne a L'Amour are my personal favorites.  This album has a great mix of English and foreign language songs.  It also mixes upbeat tunes with more laidback ballads.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for an artist who lies somewhere between the opera and pop music worlds.  Now I just can't wait for his third album!!!

0767817478|5.0|This was a hit and I'll tell you why..It had everything you could want from Godzilla..size, speed, and the brain of an animal that just wants to survive...Not to do charity runs for the town people when an oversize moth shows up..It's funny how viewers see this film as a disgrace to the original Godzilla, but a man in a suit isn't the answer...King Kong is a good example of what a monster should be like and aged much better than Godzilla, until This movie showed up....Many viewers should be applauding it..Finally we have a Zilla flick that shows true people doing what they do best..protecting their town when a stranger of this magnitude comes crashing in....Many hated the fact Godzilla was killed in this film, but how many would be calling 911 if they saw giant footsteps outside their window and you just knew a little one would be ready to take his place...Maybe the Japanese's are scared of the big ugly old lizard, but New Yorkers? Mess with New York and your likely to get a wake-up call tomorrow...That is what this film shows and that is why I rate it the best of all the Godzilla movies...New Yorkers may run, but they will strike back and not scream Godzilla and do nothing...King Kong found that out...You have a Godzilla that is lean, mean, fast and revengeful against those that hate him and not against the whole city! I think the viewers need to re-see and buy this flick, because many that attacked it, is what is going to kill the Godzilla flicks for good! Critic's hopes of this, that and picking it apart politically, instead of just seeing it as entertainment with some of the best special effects that Godzilla has ever faced, will finally put an end to Godzilla literally without a shot fired! There isn't any plans to make a new one here or Japan, because viewers are getting too political over it and decide to pass it bye.. I suggest save Godzilla and buy this film and look at it for it's different aspect and not compare it to the old ones! It's worth the DVD price!

Les unplugged Jeff's guitar numerous times (for obvious reasons) cause Les knew he was outmatched. I have been a Jeff Beck fan for nearly 40 years and he still manages to astound and confound. This guy has THE GIFT and &quot;You had it coming&quot; showcases just that. Inventive and brilliant are just a few of the words to describe this gentleman.No selling out here just excellent and well thought out music. Jeff Beck flattens all of them. Make no mistake....

Sure, Prince's best material may be behind him, and like most artists, each one has their time.  But Purple Rain was a masterpiece.  Sometimes he recorded material that was a little weird, but no one can deny his talent and songwriting skills. Prince's legacy in popular music is secure!
B00009Y3R6|5.0|Amazing movie about an amazing group of women. Molly is officially my hero.

As a person of color I can identify with the tragedy they faced from the white Austrailians as well as by their own people.<br />I will say a prayer for all the families torn apart by misguided ideologies.
B000021XS0|5.0|One of the greatest albums i have ever heard, I heard of dream theater from word of mouth, and wasnt really sure what to expect, but i did hear good things and decided to purchase an album, scenes from a memory did not dissapoint, Not only is this one of my favorite cd's but i became a huge fan after listening to it, I have listened to previous albums that they have made and though the songs are quite good i feel it doesnt match up with the quality of scenes from a memory, James LaBries voice has such a wide range that i could picture him singing ballads on his own, Not that there isnt power ballads on this album, which i find amazing, John Petrucci's guitar work is top notch, with some really amazing guitar solos, Mike Portnay is who really stands out on the album with some really sick drumming, some of the best i have ever heard, John Myung and Jordan Rudess also add their skill to their kick ass sound, Not only would i reccomend this album but i would hope you will pick up their DVD with it, to experience their live show which proves they can play in front of a crowd just as well as they can in the studio, This album goes through so many different sounds that it puts the listener in many different moods, but it works and the whole cd flows very well like a story (which it is), Go buy it! DT rox!
0385504209|1.0|This is a novel, and not a very good one at that.  I was disappointed to find that this was yet another quest for the Holy Grail, and I guessed \\"who-dunnit\\" as soon as the character was introduced. I also found Brown's one and only plot device, of not revealing important matters of fact to the reader, tiresome after awhile.  It was entertaining enough actually to warrant 2 stars; however, the misinformation that it conveys as truth requires a demotion.  I cared so little about this book that I had no intention of adding yet another review, but I became greatly concerned by all the comments by readers who believe they learned so much from this \\"informative read.\\"  To say that you have learned about Christianity from this book is the equivalent to learning about the Kennedy assassination by watching Oliver Stone's \\"JFK.\\"  Dan Brown takes a smattering of truth and mixes it with bits and pieces of multiple theories in a clumsy attempt to support a fragile hypothesis.  As I am a religious scholar, none of the theories was new to me, as they obviously are to most readers.  The reason so few are familiar with the concepts outlined in the novel is that there is no evidence to support these theories, so they have not been incorporated in mainstream history, religion, and art texts.    I am neither a Christian nor a fan of the Catholic Church, but Dan Brown's novel both obfuscates and detracts from the historically valid arguments denouncing organized religion.  Read this book for fun, but get your history elsewhere.
B000002GVO|3.0|I know this is supposed to be the Eagles' &quot;masterpiece&quot;, but to me this album marked the beginning of Don Henley's solo career. Before this album was started founding member Bernie Leadon decided to leave. Bernie was the sole source of the band's bluegrass/country mix, which I think was the key to their earlier success. Without Bernie's excellent banjo, mandolin and acoustic guitar playing, not to mention his great electric guitar licks and vocals, the Eagles morphed into just another hard-rock band. Replacing Bernie with the already well-established Joe Walsh completely messed up the unique sound of the band. When Joe sings it sounds like another Joe Walsh solo album, not an Eagles song. It would be like, say, George Harrison leaving the Beatles and being replaced by, say, Eric Clapton - certainly a great artist and guitar player, but when Eric would sing one of his songs it would make the Beatles sound like Eric Clapton's backup band. The Eagles' identity was created by the magic of four guys - Don Henley, Glen Frey, Randy Meisner and Bernie Leadon. Their first two albums feature just these four. On their third album Don Felder was brought aboard for his slide guitar skills; in my opinion his playing got in the way of what was already a near-perfect blend of musicians. The third album has some great songs on it, but several are overloaded with too many guitars going on at once. After that the drive for huge commercial success, coming from Henley, Frey, and their manager, pretty much set the stage for the departure of Leadon and then Meisner. The last studio album they ended up making sounded like a Joe Walsh solo album, a Poco album (with Meisner's replacement from that band singing), and a Henley solo album. It's amazing to me that Henley,Frey,Walsh and Schmidt (and at least a dozen support musicians) continue to tour as the &quot;Eagles&quot;. Amazing - and depressing - that people continue to cough up $150 to see this Eagles tribute band play the old classics. Oh well!classics. Oh well!
B0000024ZC|5.0|30 years later and this album sounds better than ever. If you enjoy prog music, this album is a must. These gentlemen obviously did their homework. No repetition or ridiculous love songs here. All band members are well versed on numerous instruments and provide a most interesting listening experience. A conceptually based album that's guaranteed to keep you on your toes. Alright so &quot;Schooldays&quot; is a bit dry, but the remaining work is brilliant. Lest we not forget &quot;Glass Houses&quot; also. Somebody get rid of the junk we are forced to listen to nowadays, and bring these guys back. Music with intelligence and a backbone is how I describe Gentle Giant.
0440238609|4.0|One of my friends really loves these books, so I finally decided to read them.  Well, they weren't as horrible as I thought they would be.  Just kidding, I actually liked them a lot.  I may even put them on my wish list, but then again, maybe not.  I didn't really like the way the author talked about God.  He sort of acted like God could be destroyed, and I didn't really like that.  I mean, I know it was a fantasy and all, but it made me kind of uncomfortable.  But, onto its good points: the author is really original.  He took some ideas from other books, but gave them a sort of twist which made the books really unique.  I also liked the way he developed his characters.  For example, at the beginning, Lyra was a wild little barbarian, and by the end of the Amber Spyglass, she matures into a sensitive girl who thinks about others.  Overall, a pretty great book that I would recommend to ages twelve and over because of some violence and scary moments.
B00005176F|5.0|Well, here we are again after 6 superb albums from the brit-pop-indie band blur, we have come to their best hits album and it certainly was a good title. Every song on this album is worth a listen with a few of my favourites being, song 2, beetlebum and the ever funny and fresh &quot;country house&quot; <br />Although i am  a die hard blur fan i must say that anyone who is not familiar with the previous blur albums i would definately recommend this album. Collecting together old hits it takes you down memory lane to the grunge-pop days of the 90's.<br />Although there are no new tracks on this album for the blur fans it is definately worth the few pounds.  The CD collects all of the best tracks and will be constanly on your cd player and will become your favourite album of the legendary band now on their 7th and possibly best album.
B00005QIPH|5.0|The strokes have proved they are more than just a bunch of rich kids. Both albums were put together well. I played both albums all the way through without stopping to skip to the next song, and that is what a rock album should be. They are much better in concert, and keep the audience live. If you buy this album you wont be disappointed.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is a tremendous series - well written, lots of likeable characters, interesting plots, good action.  I hope the planned movie will be a success and that the series will get picked back up.  If you're looking for some good sci-fi to clear the bad taste of Enterprise from your brain, you need Firefly.
B0000025DV|5.0|maybe in the top ten albums of all time in my opinion.  an absolute gem!  simply cannot take a road trip without this album.  no one song is any better than the others, every song is melt your ears good.  brilliant mixing of natural sounds, (thunder, whale song), with the music.  best when listend to driving on I-40 between flagstaff and albuquerque or on home stereo with lights out just chillin.  just a beautiful, beautiful thing here.  buy this album.
B000002MJC|5.0|I think one of the most admirable things about Depeche Mode is their want to reinvent their sound from album to album. 'Violator' was the greatest success of their career up to that time, but Martin, Andrew, David, and Alan would not be content. They continued to strive to make an album that was not like anything they had produced previously. <br />'Songs of Faith and Devotion' is right up their with DM's best work (for argument's sake, their last 5 albums before 'Exciter'). The album overall definitely has a heavier sound than any of their other albums, but it's not continuous. 'Judas' and the refreshing 'One Caress' are softer works which are just as stimulating as the well-known 'I Feel You' and 'In Your Room' (I think a marvelous Depeche Mode piece). <br />'In Your Room' is maybe worth a short discussion here since it was the last single with Alan Wilder. There seems to be a certain climax to their entire career in this song (at least DM's career with Wilder) - it's hard to be specific but there's a feeling of 'this is as good as we can do.' <br />'Songs of Faith and Devotion' is yet another album where every song is great, though I have to admit that I wasn't too impressed with 'Get Right With Me' when first hearing it. After having listened to the album countless times, the song grew on me. <br />Amid the stories of DM's troubles around this time, the b-side 'My Joy' seemed to go completely unnoticed. While 'Songs Of Faith And Devotion' has great, heavier songs such as 'Mercy in You' and 'Rush', neither quite capture the *raw* emotion of 'My Joy'. <br />I'll conclude this here review by mentioning 'Higher Love,' a very memorable (can I say beautiful?) conclusion to an album that unfortunately saw the departure of Alan Wilder (and the end of AN era), but is nevertheless brilliant.

B000060P79|5.0|Sure, they aren't Led Zeppelin, and I don't think they want to be (thank God). Simple Plan are just a harmless group of high school friends from Toronto who write catchy pop tunes and have clicked with the better part of today's teen population. That's right, I hate to disappoint you guys, but they aren't the anti-Christ. <br />No, they don't play like Hendrix, and no, they probably won't write the next 'Dark Side,' but that is what in part draws people to them. You see, they aren't the kind of band that is going to only associate only with the people on the guest list, and they don't look down on anyone who doesn't write \\"important\\" music. Besides, they always make a point to hang out after their shows and meet anyone that wants to meet them, even if it takes a few hours.<br />'No Pads' embodies the no-pretense attitude of the band perfectly. The hooks of 'I'd Do Anything' and 'Addicted' are irresistible by pop standards, paving the way for track after track of crafty songwriting by the boys. Even when lead singer Pierre Bouvier belts \\"I'm sorry I can't be perfect,\\" you can practically hear every teenager in the world sniffle. And if that's not worth something \\"important,\\" then what is?
B00012QM8G|5.0|I've seen this movie about 3 times and will be buying the DVD and watching it for the 4th, 5th... time.  The movie represents the best and worst in humans and should be watched by everyone (except young children).  Check your preconceptions at the door and watch it with an open and honest mind and you WILL be affected.  There are probably some creative interpretations, but in whole this movie delivers its purpose with compassion.
B00005BL2A|4.0|I never thought I'd say something bad about DM - but I have to - when I first heard the album I thought it was decent, but my opinion's gone a little further south since then... <br />I was really looking forward to 'Exciter' - 'Dream On' is a fair track (but a weak single). The band was right when they said it epitomizes the album: interesting lyrics at times, but for the most part weak in comparison to previous work of the last 10 or 15 years. <br />As far as the structure of music is concerned, the music seems undirected (sometimes, only sometimes) - I have no idea why certain people/critics insist that this is their most acoustic album to date - I can hear a guitar here and there, but check out 'Ultra' - that had much more going on. <br />Comparing it with 'Ultra' is pretty much why I'm unhappy with 'Exciter' - some said Simenon's production was too much (I thought he did a fantastic job) - Bell has added a lot of background 'bleeping' effects which simply don't go with the music and don't add anything to the overall feel - 'Freelove' is the best example of this - I find it annoying (something I've never experienced with DM before)... <br />I could write a small thesis about 'Exciter' so I won't drag this out too much longer: <br />I think 'The Sweetest Condition' and 'When The Body Speaks' are some of the better tracks that DM have come out with ('Shine' and 'Breathe' also)...so the album does have merit. <br />'I Am You' is simply a BAD track though - maybe the worst I've ever heard from them. 'Boys Say Go!' is better than this. 'Freelove' at least had some decent ideas musically going on and lyrically it was ok. 'I Am You' is just terrible. The two instrumentals didn't help my overall impression of the album. (I'd take 'Oberkorn (It's a Small Town)' over these). <br />'Ultra' was a direction that I really, really admired - it was still heavily electronic but had some very pronounced non-electronic influences - as did 'Songs Of Faith And Devotion' - <br />On that matter, where the hell are the drums in this album? I wanted drums. I needed drums - check out the B-sides to 'Only When I Lose Myself' to see not only great drum work by Mr. Eigner, but also a real instrumental. In case you were wondering, the 'backbone' I referred to meant drums. <br />I'm sorry - I think 'Exciter' is an okay album, but every time I listen to it I become more disappointed. I wasn't looking for another 'Ultra' or any other album. What I WAS looking for was an album that had drums (a subdued Christian Eigner on one track just won't cut it).
B00005JMJ4|4.0|There is alot more to this movie than meets the eye. I've never written a review before but this movie was good enough to make me stop and tell you to buy it.  Bill Murray's performance is unbelievable.
B00005JMNA|5.0|i loved this movie. the lead female actress was a good dancer, but an okay actress. the dancing scenes made me want to get up and dance. i loved the music so much, i bought the sound track the very next day! it is a very fun movie!
B000002KCI|5.0|I cannot think of one weak album by Neil Young AND CRAZY HORSE that came out during the 70s. Some of his albums with other musicians didn't quite cut it for me (e.g., Journey through the Past). ZUMA is a perfect example of Neil &amp; Crazy Horse doing what they do best: flexing their rock and roll muscles. <br />Forget the crummy cover art. Ignore the throwaway &quot;Through My Sails&quot; which I think he did only to give the three other guys a little work doing their downturns. This album cooks with gas and nitro. &quot;Drive Back&quot; is a rocking blues tune, as is &quot;Barstool Blues&quot;. We all know the moody boiler, &quot;Cortez the Killer&quot;, is an overlooked classic. And &quot;Stupid Girl&quot; probably has one of the most outrageous lyrics in music history: &quot;Your such a beautiful fish, flopping in the summer sand/Looking for the wave you missed, when another one is close at hand&quot;. That got me hook, line and sinker! Pick up this underrated album!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I recently borrowed this album from a friend and I was immediately blown away!  This album is truly incredible and I'm not exaggerating!  As soon as I listened to it, I knew I had to buy myself a copy.  I'm so glad I did because I'm getting so much enjoyment out of it!  I literally listen to the entire CD without skipping 1 track!  This has never happened EVER!  Believe it or not, I was never much of a fan of Britney in the past, but this album has definitely changed my mind!  Some of the tracks are easily among the best pop songs I've ever heard, especially Breathe On Me, Toxic, and Touch of My Hand.  If you listen to this album at least once, I guarantee you'll be hooked like I am!  Don't hesitate picking it up for 1 minute!!
B000000WZ4|5.0|'ULTRA' is, like all of Depeche Mode albums, very diverse in its sound - one reason for this diversity is linked to the various session musicians used throughout. In my mind, the album came very close to topping 'Violator,' maybe the only reason it didn't is the lack of an outstanding song/single...<br />...though this should not be taken in the wrong way - every song IS unique and meaningful, especially 'Home' and 'Useless' (the album's third [double a-side] single) which are possibly the best examples of the album's diversity.<br />'Useless' is, in my mind, one of DM's most hard-edged themes - even more so than most of the songs of 'Songs Of Faith And Devotion.' It comes about from the song's indescribable honesty and inspiration. As a result, it's one of my favorite songs from 'ULTRA'. 'Barrel Of A Gun' is also a classic song of the same vein.<br />'Home' is a slower-paced affair that is just as, if not more, inspiring partly due to Martin Gore's unforgettable riff at the climax of the song. 'Freestate' is just as emotionally uplifting.<br />As I said before, every song (including the two b-side instrumental tracks) are fantastic. I'll forgo commenting on the actual sound of the album (as I typically do) and refer the reader to the title of the review.<br />Some have criticized this album on several grounds: the main criticism concerning the quality of the album. I think it's extremely unfortunate that most do not realize ALL of the troubles of the band over the last 7 or 8 years (circa 1992 and onward). The fact that core of the group managed to stay together and produce an album of such an outstanding quality as 'ULTRA' is an inspiration in itself.
0671027387|5.0|COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SUBJECT MATTER THAN DAVINCI OR ANGELS:<br />Dan Brown is now one of my favorite writers.  Angels & Demons and the DaVinci code (which I thoroughly enjoyed) were the first and second of his books I read and this prompted me to be concerned that his attention to detail and crafting a wonderfully involved story was limited to Religious symbology and similar doctrines.  Well, I had nothing to worry about.<br />MAIN STORY, VERY BRIEFLY:<br />Deception point revolves around a political campaign, NASA, geology and marine biology.  Strange bedfellows aren't they, but it works.<br />Rachel Sexton a gister (yes, I spelled that right) for the government is contacted by the president.  Her boss is concerned, it is for political manipulation as her father is a U.S. senator, the president's opponent in the upcoming election.<br />As the day's events unfold, Rachel is very divided as to who is being truthful or not.  She is to be witness to a great discovery along with many famous scientists.  Is the president banking on her family name or her reputation with data?  Both could be true or it could be something else entirely.<br />When there are questions about the situation she is involved in, things get very complicated very fast and who are friends and enemies is not so clear cut.<br />CONSISTENT WITH DAN BROWN'S STYLE AND EXCELLENT WRITING:<br />As with any of Dan Brown's books, each chapter is brief well-crafted and builds up to a phenomenal story line.  If you like a book (and I do) that brings in bit by bit all the main players and crafts their story until it interweaves in an amazing climax, this is the book for you.  I personally am not politically oriented, know little about NASA and could care less about marine biology and geology, but I had difficultly putting this book down. Each section was riveting and each wanted me to read on.<br />Great job, when are you going to write more?
B00005MP58|5.0|This BBC/A&amp;E series is right up there with Brideshead Revisited as the best work ever done for TV; and due to its tauter story line, its light-footed wit and its stylistic unity I am more and more convinced that P&amp;P may just have the edge... Whereas Brideshead deals with drama that, despite its religious undertones, is basically modern, P&amp;P is driven by lots of excitement over events that may seem rather futile from a 21st century perspective. However, the art of the makers of this series, and indeed of Jane Austen, is such, that the viewer is drawn into the frame of reference of middle and upper class people in the early 1800s from the very first scenes, and within 30 minutes you're hooked. I think I have watched this series ten or eleven times by now, and its delights are undiminished, as, surprisingly, is the suspense - will they get each other or not?<br />The series derives much of its strength directly from the strength of Austen's text: it closely adheres to both the words and the spirit of the book. This filmed version is worlds away from the absurd, stuffily Victorian 40s movie, with hoop-skirted ladies, an overdose of frills and heavily mutilated dialogue. Here, we get all the breezy freshness of the early years of the Romantic era, with its love of nature and naturalness, reflected both in frequent outdoor activities and Greek-style dress for the ladies, among other things. The series' makers have exploited this further in stressing the basic similarity of Elizabeth and Darcy as nature beings, both using physical activity as an antidote to emotional turmoil: she tramping through the countryside whenever she can; he, taking fencing lessons, and his by now famous dive into the Pemberley pond to overcome his feelings for the woman who refused him.<br />The balance between high comedy and emotional drama is expertly judged. Mr Collins and Mrs Bennet provide many occasions for laughter, without ever quite sinking into mere caricature, and the elegant cynicism adopted by Mr Bennet to deal with his less than happy choice of partner, is titillating (though in the end it becomes his undoing). At the same time, the story hinges on a few scenes of extreme dramatic power, each and every one representing (more than) Oscar-worthy feats of acting and writing. Darcy's first proposal, with Colin Firth pacing the Hunsford Parsonage parlour like some animal in distress, is played out as an unparalleled clash of two very powerful and independent characters, both acting on misguided preconceptions, and the viewer is made to feel the violent emotions of both most acutely. The meeting in the Pemberley grounds, much later, then offers the catharsis. This is the beginning of Darcy's transformation, something Austen leaves implicit in her text, a problem which has been resolved by the script writers of the series in a way that aspires to sheer genius. The proud aristocrat turns into a stammering, lovesick schoolboy and yet it is clear we are only seeing another side to the same man. And finally there is the fantastic scene of Lady Catherine's Great Intervention: a duel of words as sharp as any ever written, delivered with utmost conviction, and, astonishingly, representing a literal four-page long citation from the book: such is the power of Austen the dramatist! Of course all these main protagonists are perfectly cast, but the same seems to hold true even for the smallest supporting roles. Lady Anne de Bourgh doesn't speak a single word during her few appearances - and yet how we pity her when we briefly cut from the final wedding ceremony to the Rosings saloon, where she is locked up, newly deprived of her intended husband, with that Gorgon of a mother... It is one of the instances, by the way, where the script writers have made a character a little more sympathetic than Austen did, who stresses Anne's haughtiness; here, she is a frail, morose and pitiable creature. To some extent the same even goes for Darcy - in the book, athis second proposal, he somewhat self-righteously stresses that Lizzy's bad opinion of him the first time, was based on her being deceived by others; in the series, he appears more softened and contrite.<br />So this is perfection then? Unfortunately, no such thing exists... Even in a production so carefully managed as this one, on repeated viewing one notices the odd mistake: lush green foliage in front of Longbourn, two days before Christmas; distinctly 20th century stained glass behind the minister performing the Wickham wedding; Mr. Darcy, running up the stairs to his room at Rosings, and next seen looking out of its window - on the ground floor. But such little slips are massively compensated by everything that is spot on, from the food on the table to the lack of a pin under the cellist's instrument. And talking about cello's, Carl Davis's score is a masterpiece in itself, with some extremely memorable instances of musical characterization. His heavily ornamented baroque sounds constitute at least half of Lady Catherine's pompous, reactionary character.<br />To my regret I have to agree with other reviewers who complain about the colors on the DVD. Scenes do appear over-exposed, with too extreme dark-light contrasts, and midtones are faded. Some fiddling with your TV color settings helps a little, but will not restore the nuances of color that we know from the broadcasts to be there.  DVD on the other hand does offer an enduring memento of what is definitely one of the greatest moments in TV-history!s second proposal, he somewhat self-righteously stresses that Lizzy's bad opinion of him the first time, was based on her being deceived by others; in the series, he appears more softened and contrite.<BR>So this is perfection then?

0446677450|5.0|The key to the success of Rich Dad Poor Dad is that it presents the process of achieving financial success in an easy to follow system that can be broken down into even easier to follow components. In other words, instead of presenting a system that is complex and requires an advanced degree or high level of experience to master, Rich Dad Poor Dad presents a real proven system that has been used by the author to attain his financial success. One thing that I have noticed over and over when reading books on financial success, is that very often the simple plans of action are what really work.<BR>Take a look at the Millionaire Mind or the Millionaire Brain, they both showcase the actions and thoughts of actual millionaires who have clearly achieved their financial goals.<BR>The Millionaire Mind demonstrates how millionaires for the most part have simple fundamental principles that they stick to while the Millionaire Brain explains how those millionaires put their plans into action and how we can emulate their actions and achieve our own level of success.<BR>It is clear from reading Rich Dad Poor Dad that the author is adhering to a simple, yet effective, methodology which we can all implement in our daily lives to achieve the level of success we are looking for.
B000002UB6|3.0|Not as good as the earlier Beatle albums (Hard Day's Night, Help) but better than Rubber Soul, Revolver, Sgt. Pepper or Magical Mystery Tour.  This is because, with Let It Be, the group attempted to return to their rock roots that were buried beneath the lite pop, over produced, studio manufactured tracks of the mid 60s.  <br />This 1970 version, produced by Phil Spector, is only version that will stand the test of time.  The 2003 release is subpar.
B00004Y6NW|5.0|To fully understand the impact Mark Knopfler made with his band Dire Straits, one have to recall the musical landscape of 1978. Punk-rock was on its peak of success. New musical directions like, new-wave, post-punk, industrial raised head. British heavy metal was gaining strength. And in the midst of such aggressive novelties Dire Straits offered very old-school music, basically a rhythm-n-blues, combined with a little country, a little art-rock, and plain old rock-n-roll. Who could have thought such an out-of-place album would be a huge success?<br />The key to the success is the ultimate perfection in everything, displayed in this record. Mark wrote perfect songs, the band made perfect arrangements, and they also played perfect! I won't be telling a secret, claiming that Mark Knopfler is perhaps one of ten greatest guitar-players of all time. Just listen to his calm riffing, emotional licks or solos that touch your soul, and you'll see what I mean. His playing style is instantly recognizable. This record generally sounds calm, melodic, sad, and introscope. It provides just the right amount of variety, with a faster \\"Setting Me Up\\" with a strong rock-n-roll feel, calm \\"Six Blade Knife\\", \\"Wild West End\\" and \\"Lions\\", a harder \\"In The Gallery\\", and bluesy melodic greatness of \\"Down to the Waterline\\" and \\"Sultans of Swing\\".<br />The album is created with perfect taste and plenty of soul to it. It comes highly recommended, and perhaps this is where your Dire Straits collection should start.

0671015206|5.0|The Millionaire Next Door is a fantastic masterpiece on the essential characteristics that millionaires share. What was even more compelling for me than the actual statistics were the insights that these statistics indicate. For instance, if millionaires on average live below their means and at the same time invest their means into their own businesses, then this indicates that by far that all of their experience indicates that if one wants to have the best chance of attaining millionaire status he or she must have a business of their own. I was reading the Millionaire Brain by Donny Lowy, and I noticed that many of the millionaires who were self employed all followed very specific plans based on carefully planned out strategies. Even when they were operating in very diverse businesses there was a correlation between the planning and execution methods that all millionaire business owners shared.<BR>What the Millionaire Brain does show, which the Millionaire Next Door supports, is that the characteristics of a millionaire need to be invested in actions that are backed by a plan of action that has been proven to produce positive results. If you look at Bill Gates or at Donald Trump, you will see that they both had plans of actions that were based on the fundamental precepts that all millionaire business owners share.
B000002UZ1|2.0|With 12 of the 14 songs on Disc 1 being from the Sgt. Pepper and Magical Mystery Tour period, this greatest hits package starts off pretty badly.  It picks up with the more rock oriented hits from the While Album, but then fades quickly with songs that really aren't that good - Don't Let Me Down, Ballad of John &amp; Yoko, Old Brown Shoe (this is a hit?), and Across the Universe.  No reason to own this.
B00009RGBS|2.0|I love the show &quot;Chicago&quot;; however this is horrible!  Renee cannot sing or dance!  Putting men into the number &quot;Cell Block Tango&quot;?! - Fosse didn't and he should know!  Also SIX (count 'em) SIX songs were left out.  The best thing about this movie was that Marc Calamia (hot!) is in it as a dancer (from the Broadway cast) but all too briefly.  Buy or rent &quot;Fosse&quot; if you want to see more (almost ALL of!) Marc and some REAL dancing!
630542828X|5.0|Jan Schlichtmann (Travolta)  is a Boston tort lawyer and something of an ambulance chaser who is initially reluctant to take on an industrial pollution case involving some children dead of leukaemia in rural New England. He changes his mind when he realizes the likely defendants are a couple of big companies with particularly deep pockets and smells the possibility of serious money. Over time, however his interest in the case becomes a moral obsession. The cynical becomes a crusader, refusing offers to settle as his company's finances spiral downwards towards bankruptcy. <br />If you like courtroom dramas, this is highly recommended. It's one of the best specimens of the genre to come out of America since `The Verdict'. It's interesting to compare it to `Erin Brockovich' released a couple of years later. EB is about how a heroic small timer takes on the big boys of corporate America and how her pluck and determination triumphs over all obstacles, something of a legal feelgood movie in other words. Which this, to its great credit, is not. Its central character, for starters, is far more amibivalently likeable: initially just out for a fast buck, moral seriousness has to creep up on him and take him by surprise (perhaps reminding writer/director Zaillian of Oskar Schindler whose story he scripted for Spielberg a few years earlier) and the story's development paints a significantly more ambivalent picture of what pluck and determination can accomplish. It's a highpoint of Travolta's acting career even if he is comprehensively upstaged by Robert Duvall, on brilliant form as his quietly cynical adversary, bigshot lawyer Jerome Facher who knows far better than to look for the truth in a courtroom...

B000068CNX|5.0|Friends is so Great!!  It shows you how people from culturally diverse backgrounds can get along and live together, not like most tv shows where they'd have you believe everyone in the world (let alone big cities like New York) is white.  Also I like it when the Friends go to events, concerts, new restaurants, ethnic festivals, etc., and really explore the city and world around them.  Not like most shows where the main characters just sit around the same place and talk.  How boring, right!?<br />Friends is truly an enlightening revelation in the tv world!!!<br />So get Friends Season Whatever on dvd now!!!
0792844890|4.0|I used to talk about this with my friends back in middle school, and now today in college I still enjoy it.  If you like Mel brooks then you'll enjoy this movie.  If you have yet to experience brooks then go out and rent his movies, they're hilarious.  I would've given this movie 5 stars except that I despise the robot that is voiced by Joan rivers, it killed the movie. I know it was supposed to make fun of C-3P0 but it was stupid and I hate it. Outside of Dot Matrix, the movie is hilarious
B00008PW2D|1.0|In shopping around and doing some price comparisons the average cost of this DVD is $32 - $41. How dare HBO charge the consumer the identical price of seasons 1-4. The DVD only contains 8 lousy episodes. I refuse to pay full price for half the product. It's cases like this that I say the He** with the industry crying over piracy. First they sat around doing NOTHING to be proactive about stopping piracy before it got out of control as it did. Then instead of looking at their own inactions they started to sue teenagers as a fright tactic. This DVD represents the reason why people were stealing the product. They've been raping both the consumer and artist for many years now with insanely inflated prices and pennies on the dollar for the artist. I say they got exactly what they deserved no sympathy here. Greed can be very ugly indeed.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Much like Royal Tannenbaums, you will like this movie, or you will hate it. You have to be able to really appreciate this movie as art, and not just entertainment. There are so many cookie cutter safe movies out there. I am just saying, if you want to watch this movie and enjoy it, just kick back and soak it in. Do not try to over analyze it, or look for meaning, the first time you watch it. Just enjoy it forwhat it is...
B00006BTCA|2.0|i dont want to bash this band i had nothing personal against them. but i was looking around cdnow and i came across this band a couple of times and ive never heard of them so i got the cd to listen. the thing about this band is its not psychedelic at all like everyone says. the drums and guitars were nothing fancy very simple. and after 7 songs it just got a little bland. noene of the songs seemed to have a climax point to it it just sort of faded away. for those of you who are realkly hardcore into the new york scene might find this album perfect but as a casual listener i didnt find it as good as they should have been
B00005JMJ4|2.0|It's a dissapointment.  It's  a slightly sad whisper quiet dainty snapshot of living life out of a hotel room in a foreign country where you don't have many people you can communicate with.  This movie has no crescendo.  It's flat sad the whole time.  Bill Murray just restrains his actions more to get serious and only gives one joke at a time and the jokes are spaced at least 15 minutes apart.  <br />It does make you wonder whether Bill will bag the girl or not and that's the suspense of the movie.  I guess also the girl and Bill make each other's time in Tokyo less lonely.  I just wasn't moved by this movie.  You'd think a guy making $2 million to fly to  Tokyo to do a commerical could afford to bring a few friends along so he wouldn't get bored.  <br />One of the bigger dissapointments I've seen in the last few years.  LIke others have said it doesn't deserve the hype.

Tim Curry's performance is worth the cost of the DVD alone. THE best and SCARIEST portrayal of the devil in the film industry, in my humble opinion. With this ultimate edition you get the directors cut of how the movie was released in Europe (and should have been in the US). Awesome sets, costumes, soundtracks, special effects and make up truly make this a great viewing experience...

B000002GJH|5.0|i decided to get this album after i watched the hunger strike video. im a huge pearl jam fan and i love chris cornell's vocals so this was a no brainer. This CD is amazing in a different sense than i thought. This shows how good a pearl jam can be without eddie vedder and it also shows how good cornell can be without soundgarden. there is some truth to the fact that chris cornell seems a little more comfortable in temple of dog. he seems more laid back and his vocals come a little more natural. in soundgarden he was always very tense and intense which wasnt a bad thing but it was totally different style on this album. he fit in perfectly with those nice stone gossard guitar. ed makes a great appearance in hunger strike as well. you wont be dissapointed if you get this record
B000000WF0|5.0|I have had this cd for about 5 years, but have never really given it a good listen. For me it was one of those albums that you may have bought but never really ever listened to. About a month ago I put it into my cd played and it has not come out since. The songwriting is great and the music is rather psychedelic in nature. This has to be one of the most underated albums of the 90's, because it truly has to be held up there with the best.
B00005JME0|4.0|I saw the Butterfly Effect and I thought it was great. This is a movie that plays with your mind and also the what ifs of life and your own brain. This movie will play with your head and then you start to think...what if this could really happen? Ashton Kutcher gives a mind blowing performance as a college student who can go back in time to certain areas where he blacked out and try to change things for the better but usually it just gets worse. It makes you think...if I could go back in time and change something from my past, would I? Definitely worth seeing.
B00003W8NM|5.0|The best movie of it's genre. Absolutely exceillent. With a high powered acting ensemble, you are taken on an amazing ride inside the head of an over worked sales rep.<br />In the end it is a story about burn out and wanting to stop everything to start all over again. <br />The two disc pakage is full of everything behind this movie and, yes, just watch out for that hidden spliced in frame. It pops up now and then.
B0000VAFO0|3.0|I watched this movie last Sunday evening and found it entertaining. The plot (an ongoing war between vampires and their former slaves, werewolves)was promising, although perhaps more could be expected from it. Fine image, great soundtrack and the kind of gothic scenarios that I love. Acting was good, and Ms. Beckinsale looked gorgeous in her Matrix-bent vampire outfit. Action sequences were fine, except for the effect of the very last sword coup, which I found hilarious rather than impressing. Bottomline: It won`t make history, but is not boring at all, if you like this genre.

RFS is my favorite cd of all time..its the story of my life. mayer is so easy to relate to and not to mention, a honest humble guy. i recommend RFS to anyone who apreciates good, honest music..its so much better than the garbage rock music that fills our society.. john mayer has jazz, blues and pop all mixed together..genious!
B0000C8AW2|4.0|Upon its June 1978 release, Bob Dylan's \\"Street Legal\\" was dismissed by some critics as imitation Springsteen (Steve Douglas' saxophone was reminiscent of Clarence Clemons but only to fans of the Boss), and reviled by others for sexist lyrics (\\"Can you cook and sew?/Make flowers grow?\\"). In retrospect, it seems critics were lambasting Dylan's public image, then at an all-time low, and not the quality of the music.<br />Tarred and feathered by the media as an alleged wife beater, a pretentious filmmaker (\\"Renaldo and Clara\\" crashed and burned a few months earlier), and a greedy capitalist embarking on the so-called \\"Alimony Tour\\" only to generate some cash, Dylan's latest album was overshadowed by some nasty tabloid headlines. \\"Street Legal\\" is, in fact, a superb album that continues the creative hot streak that began with 1974's \\"Planet Waves\\" and ended, arguably, with 1983's \\"Infidels.\\"<br /><br />Far from sounding \\"fake\\" (Rolling Stone's description of Dylan's singing on this album), there is an effortless quality to both the songs and the performances as if pure inspiration is at work. \\"I wish I was a magician,\\" Dylan sings at one point, and on \\"Street Legal\\" he is.<br />From the countrified \\"We Better Talk This Over\\" to the sorrowful \\"Where Are You Tonight?\\" this album is as bittersweet as \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" and, at times, much more powerful. You can really feel the wounds that produced the blood, and listening to it now, it no longer seems surprising that Dylan embraced Christianity a year later. Who but the Lord could relieve such pain?<br />\\"Baby, Stop Crying,\\" a top 10 hit in the UK, soars on the wave of Douglas' sax, and \\"Senor (Tales of Yankee Power)\\" offers a tour of the dark places from which the next year's \\"Slow Train Coming\\" provided an escape.<br />Recorded in a mobile studio during a week long break from the world tour that had already produced a live album (\\"Bob Dylan at Budokon,\\" released less than a year later), the sound quality always left something to be desired, but the SACD remastering is a major improvement, and lets the performances emerge in all their power.something to be desired, but the SACD remastering is a major improvement, and lets the performances emerge in all their power.
B00003CXE7|4.0|Yes the tough man of Hollywood is shown in all his glory, playing the part of a fallen Roman general &quot;Maximus&quot; who seeks revenge on the man who killed his wife and child.<br />Sold into slavery and brought by none other than the man of all bar room fights, Oliver Reed, Maximus becomes a Gladiator and soon plots his advesarys downfall.<br />A real blood and guts movie not for family viewing.<br />As a two disc set, this package has absolutly everything you need to know about the making of this film and the history of the Gladiator.  It is such a shame that a big deal was make over the constant bloopers that showed up in the final cut, bcause you can now see them.  Thats why I have given it four stars instead of five.
B00005CDNI|5.0|Voulez-vous is an absolutely amazing album.I love it,but only second to their &quot;Visitors&quot; album.This was a massive album of the late seventies,a great year indeed.This album spawned a number of hits to expand their catalog of hit singles.Voulez-Vous had flown to the top of the US charts and was certified a double-platinum on advanced orders in that year....Incredible.I love the songs &quot;Voulez-Vous&quot;,&quot;I have a Dream&quot;,&quot;If It wasn't for the Nights&quot; and &quot;Kisses Of Fire&quot;.<br />   Voulez-Vous(the title track) boasts some heavy disco-style music and great sing-a-long harmonies.Perfectly done for a 70's track.If it appeared today,I bet it would still sond massive.I love it the best actually......In French the title means,&quot;Will U&quot; or &quot;Would you&quot;..........mm!!<br />  Another great track that deserves mention is &quot;Angeleyes&quot;.I think many artists later on also took on that track name....Ace Of Base was one.&quot;Last night I was takin' a walk along a river,and I saw him together with a young girl.......don't look too deep into those Angeleyes....oh no no no.....&quot; Interesting plot!!  hehe.]<br />  Next I loved also &quot;The King Has Lost his Crown&quot;.Nice starting to the track.A brilliant keyboard sound....then you hear them start softly and it gradually gets louder.....lovely piece of work for a 70's track!Features Annifrid on the lead vocals here.She sounds great as always......&quot;I believe ,your new girl turned U down.And they say,she's pushing U around....Disaster and disgrace,The king has lost his crown....&quot; Good lyrical stint,it means to show that how an affair could turn out to be unfair in life......love betrayal though.......<br />   Oh yeah &quot;Chiquitita&quot; is great too,but it takes time to build up on a casual listener though....It was another hit that went to the NO.2 spot.....Blondies &quot;Heart Of Glass&quot; being in the No.1 spot...Agnetha is featured here.Beautiful voice though.<br />   &quot;If It Wasn't for The Nights&quot; is a classy track and quite dancey too!Not much is said about this track's success,but it's a GREAT one.THe woprds are &quot;I've got an appointment's work I've got to do....keeping me so busy,over the do......If it wasn't for the nights I don't think I could make it thro&quot;.....They are literally shouting so loud ..not much like the usual melodious ABBA....Great track here.<br />    mmm!&quot;Lover's Live A Little Longer&quot;...I agree with them actually.A truly magnificent track to hear.I can't explain it,U guys got to hear iot to believe it....Featuring both the ladies equally and loud as ever.....That makes two screamy ,high-energy tracks.....<br />     The track&quot;Does Your Mother Know&quot;,would also certainly suit the dance floors,this time vocals taken up by the male members.Nice change in style.Hey,they can sing too!!<br />   And finally &quot;Kisses Of Fire&quot;,featuring Agnetha on the lead,is a great,great song to finish the album..&quot;Kisses of Fire,burning burning,I'm at the point of no returning.....&quot; Fancy it.A hot swinging,dance number again..Great stuff!!<br />    Voulez-Vous is an absolutely massive album.I loved it.I highly recommend it.They really got what it takes to make good pop music....They should have continued on as the Bee Gees did....Anyway I'm sure this would be a remarkable album to add to your collection of ABBA's works.It was also a solid album to end the 70's decade for them.Good!
B00000JR2A|5.0|A classic pop swan-song to the 1980's, this masterful and well-crafted piece of pop genius still resonates with me today.  The music of the 80's is constantly trashed by today's musical &quot;know-it-all's&quot; as being too bland, faceless, and overly-produced.  It's all a joke to them.  My argument would be simply be, what is wrong with listening to music that has multiple layers and multiple production values?  The Beach Boys did it with &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; in 1966, and the greatest albums from the Fab Four were all production milestones.  <BR>The 1980's were filled with great music, and many of the best groups from England were able to produce that smoky, languid, shimmering, late-at-night sounding British pop that still sounds fresh to me today.  Check out Thomas Dolby's &quot;The Flat Earth,&quot; the Blue Nile's &quot;Walk Across Rooftops&quot; and &quot;Hats,&quot; Nick Heyward's &quot;I Love You Avenue,&quot; Prefab Sprout's &quot;Two Wheels Good,&quot; and countless others by artists such as Alphaville, Deacon Blue, and others.<BR>&quot;Seeds of Love&quot; is THE definitive masterpiece of the 1980's, a devastatingly beautiful album of pop gems that was a fabulous goodbye to the decade.  Every song on the CD is almost like a mini-suite in itself; there is not one even remotely unsure moment on this one, but the highlights would have to be the achingly beautiful &quot;Swords And Knives&quot; and the astonishing &quot;Advice For the Young At Heart.&quot;  Listen to this album on a beautiful morning with your windows down, or late at night with the moon as your only source of shadows....I predict that you will fall in love with it over and over as I have.
B0001ENYKS|5.0|I saw these guys back in October in the UK, and they were quite possibly one of the best bands i've ever seen in my life! <BR>I'm thrilled the album is finally being released in the States, and you should all buy it, because listening to it makes you feel like you're living in the future!!!<br />(okay, maybe not, but it's definitely worth buying!)
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|So thats where that saying comes from. This movies takes the sheer mickey out of all the teen scream movies of the 90s era... and does it well.  Basing it's storyline on the Scream series, you get a storyline that becomes so funny that you know sequels are going to be made...Even if they said it's not going to happen. (of course it has, twice).  <BR>The opening scene with Carmen Electra is a real hoot and as for the bedroom scene in the middle...
B000089RVX|5.0|These guys are a very young band - The lyrics are mushy and artsy and the fans are teenie boppers.  But all is forgiven because Amy and friends have 'IT'.  The TALENT.. - a captured piece of magic, new and fresh, right there on the disk.  When I heard the first single on the radio I stopped the car and thought.. \\"what the [heck] is this?\\".<br />Their sound is Sarah Mclaughlin fronting for Bon Jovi. <BR>Or Tori Amos fronting for Rush.<BR>They've got the vibrancy and undiluted, white-hot passion of youth.  The sheer ambition here - the type of effect they've attempted - maybe it's a bit overwrought, but very few artists ever work at this level.  <br />I recently went to their concert in Boston - they filled an 1100 seat club - they could have easily sold out an 8K stadium - and their live show had such strong charisma that it felt like they could blow out the walls.  It was the best performance I've ever seen - like the Beatles at Ed Sullivan - a very, very powerful show.  And they were very happy to be up on stage.  I hope they taped a live CD.<br />I hear Ben Moody left the band and I don't know if Amy & friends can write this music on their own.  I certainly hope so.  I'm counting the days till the next album.
B00008OLYN|5.0|Opeth are phenomenal musicians. One of the most talented bands on the planet. <br />That T00L moron doesn't know crap. This CD is amazing. Mikael Akerfeldt's vocals are unreal. At times, they send chills down my spine. The music on this album is just simply beautiful. It is completly unlike their normal music (well, with the exception of songs like Harvest or Credence), and it is mesmerizing. <br />If you are a fan of ANY music, whether it be metal or not, I almost guarantee you will be impressed by this record. Buy it. Now.
B00012QM8G|5.0|I have only seen this film once, when it originally came out.  Just the name Schindler's List stirs up memories of both anger and saddness, mostly the latter.  This film has touched me deeply.  If you have not seen this film, buy it.  Own it.  Make it part of your library.  This is not a film that can be viewed over and over.  Because it is just to real, to very real.  This story just sits inside like a punch to the gut.  It takes time to get over.  Thank you Mr. Speilberg.  And for those of you that think movies are pieces of visual history, this is a movie, with a compelling message, and the message is clear and to the point.  It is not a documentary.
B00014K5TQ|1.0|I only gave this movie 1 star because there was no way to give it zero stars. I hated this movie. Absolutely hated it. And I only watched about a half hour of it. I've never walked out of a movie or stopped watching a movie that I rented - even if I didn't like it. But after 30 minutes of this trash I turned it off. It was horrible! The acting was horrible and it was just plain stupid. I'm fairly indifferent to Seth Green as an actor...but what was he doing in this nonsense? People say that he made a good drag queen, but they're wrong. He and Macaulay Culkin were terrible at acting like gay guys. Gay guys don't even act like that! They tried to make their speech/mannerisms look natural, but they actually looked like they were SPOOFING gay guys. It looked like something that should have been a skit on Saturday Night Live. I think this movie is offensive to gay guys everywhere. Please....I BEG you....do NOT watch this movie! In case I didn't mention it...it sucked!
B000060P79|1.0|I give most bands a chance, but these guys, i'm sorry... they suck. When i heard the lyric, \\"I'm a dick... I'm addcited to you\\" in that horrible screeching unoriginal voice, i cringed. i think my IQ actually dropped after hearing that song. and i was wondering to myself, how in the hell did these guys ever get a record contract? I grew up with green day and the offspring, and blink came in a little late in the game, but i still like them, and those bands had honesty and humor to their lyrics and something to say at least part of the time, whether it was about genocide or mastuerbating til you go blind. but at least they didnt sing about lame break-ups and petty relationship problems for the wannabe skater punk. man, i'm gonna break down the facts of this band, they can't sing, they can't play guitar, and they can't write. some bands can make up for being bad in one area by being amazing in another. not simple plan. if you have a brain, don't buy this album, please. go support some local bands, or that kid next door writing stories and playing acoustic guitar, cause they have way more talent than this band.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|I bought and watched this DVD only a few days before the Oscars. While I agree that Bill Murray did an amazing acting job, overall, this movie rates a D- from me. Utterly underwhelming, I kept waiting to connect with each of the characters. It never happened. I am still unimpressed with Sofia Coppola's directing talents, tho I can see that there is definately potential. Ultimately, &quot;who cares?&quot; was the only feeling with which I was left. <br />A real disappointment.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|A few years ago, I heard You're a Good Man Charlie Brown soundtrack  and the well crafted talents of  Kristen Chenoweth. I  heard her again  in the Walt Disney records The Music Man soundtrack as Marion the Librarian. In Wicked cd, she takes the center stage and the vocal lead. She  makes some of the  pop style lyrics of Stephen Schwartz's score her own with her powerful voice.<br />The proficiencies of Idina Menzel are not to be missed on such pieces  as The Wizard and I, One Short Day, and her show stopper Defying Gravity. The production  have spotlighted the talent of actor Joel Grey in Wonderful, which reminds me of  Mister Cellophane from the Broadway soundtrack of Chicago.<br /> The weakest spots in the whole cd are the Greek chorus like echoes through the soundtrack of &quot;Wicked&quot; from the opening song No One Mourns The Wicked, as if we do  not know the play's name. The score is overdone is some places and musically raw in others, I see why the critics gave the play a lukewarm reviews.<br />All the whole, this score is worth hearing-if only for Defying Gravity, which should become a musical theater standard like Schwartz' Day by Day from Godspell. Musically, it seems like sweet tarts for the ear..very tart and sour combined with veins of sweetness
B0000AK7AC|5.0|Babe was a runaway success in 1995.  It even got a best picture nomination and in my mind should have won. This is a fantastic movie, sure to delight children from 2-100.  Chris Noonan has created the modern farmyard parable.  He deftly brings you into his world of talking animals centered around that most amicable of pigs, Babe.  While the sheepdogs rule the farm, Babe warms the heart of sheep and dog alike, and eventually farmer Hoggett  much to the chagrin of his wife who is counting the days to the next big feast.  Ultimately Babe is spared as farmer Hoggett comes to realize he has a most unusual pig on his hands.  Babe finds himself welcomed into the fold, rising to the ultimately status of being able to come into the house on miserable nights, at the expense of the house cat.  All these animals are played wonderfully off each other.  The voices couldn't be better.  Farmer Hoggett eventually puts Babe to the ultimate challenge, the great sheepherding competition, which brings out a raucous reaction from the crowd.  But Babe soon silences them. This movie has everything one could want in a children's movie and more. It deserves its place among the classics of all time.
B0001I55OC|1.0|I am sorry I spent my money to see this movie in the theatre. The acting was stiff, the costumes and historic details were inappropriate for the time period portrayed and I dont even want to discuss \\"night arrows\\" as a legitimate battle tactic.  Dont waste your time with this one.
B0000640S1|3.0|The original Theatrical Aspect Ratio for First Blood was anamorphic widescreen - 2.35:1 (cinemascope). On its 35mm cinema film neg & stock, it is compressed horizontally in a 2:1 ratio. This interprets that on the film, it will roughly be 1.17:1 and on screen, it will magnify and stretch to its intended 2.35:1 format. <br />What deterred me from buying this particular DVD is that on its \\"Technical Information\\" page, it has listed this DVD's aspect ratio for Widescreen as - 1.85:1 (which is generally non-anamorphic and flat) suggesting that it has been incorrectly set to - \\"Letterbox\\" (used to cover production mechanics such as lens' barn doors, sound booms, etc.). If this is the case, certain part of its image that was originally viewed in the cinemas would now be blocked out. That's almost as bad as the 1.33:1 pan & scan. Maybe it's an info error? <br />I like to watch movies in the format it was intended to be seen by the filmmakers. Also, I can never understand why anyone would want to own an inferior full-screen/pan & scan format. It's like watching half a movie. <br />On this DVD release, it seems the studios have provided both widescreen & full-screen. I assume this equates to having both sides of the disc being used. It would have been better served to have an attractive picture on one side to reduce accidental handling faults such as dirt or finger prints on the read-areas of the disc. Of course, the flip side should be the majority's choice - Widescreen (when available). <br />An option for English subtitles would have been great too. When actors tend to mumble, it is handy to be able to rewind to a particular scene and turn on the subtitles to find out what the character in the script was supposed to have said.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|This movie is such a freakin' riot. I had seen it a couple of years ago, and I guess I must have watched it the first time 'round while nursing a high fever or debilitating illness. That explanation alone can only account for the reason why this dvd was added to my collection a mere two weeks ago. Why I have deprived myself of this much laughter for so long is beyond me.<br />Anyone that has given Zoolander less than 4 stars is clearly a fuddy-duddy. Owen Wilson as the scooter riding Bohemian model, Hansel, was comedic poetry. Ben Stiller, what can I say? The guy's a frickin' genius! This movie has more funny moments than not. The only part I could have lived without was the scene included for the sake of sexual gratuity. The scene I am referring to was obviously thrown in, and had no bearing on the plot line whatsoever. This scene would be a good time to refill your Coca-Cola and popcorn, or to take a quick trip changing loads in the washing machine. Zoolander has so many redeeming comedic moments, one can easily forgive the faux pas.<br />Even the celebrity cameos bring a smile. Billy Zane and his all too serious line, \\"It's a walk-off... It's a walk-off.\\"<br />Mugatu's brain-washing video, Zoolander's trip home to find his roots in the coal-mine, set to the music of Loverboy. If you are one who is not easily amused, and are more discriminating with regard to your brand of comedy...Zoolander will become a oft-read, well-worn bookshelf classic in your home.
B00003CXE7|5.0|I have been arguing about Maximu's Nationality.  In the Movie the claim is that he is from Spain. However, he was just named a Spaniard by his master after he lost his wife and only son.  So can someone help me here please.  email me as soon as possible.
B00000IN5G|5.0|Well, what can I say.  Pure oblivion to all senses.  Complete and total shred-heads who deserve a standing ovation!  Go by Children Of Bodem, you won't be disappointed.  Oh yeah, Stratovarius isn't a bad idea either!
0385504209|3.0|This was a well put together suspense novel.  (Emphasis on the word novel.)  I thought I had the villain figured out and then it surprised me, which is a plus!  It had quick pacing, until it hit about 40 pages of explanation of the Holy Grail theory which went slightly over the top.  However, the pace picked up again for the rest of the story.  Overall, a good, fun read, but I wasn't able to see what qualities have left this book up so long on amazon.com's top 10 books sold list.  Take it with a grain of salt (after all, it doesn't have a bibliography) and enjoy it for the puzzle-solving and chase elements.
B0000CFW87|1.0|This is not music.  This is manufactured tunesmithing.  Don't buy this.  If you want mellow, then what ever happened to your 10,000 Maniacs CDs?  Or Mozart?  Even Sarah McLachlan was good, right?  Get thee to a real artist--this guy should be a sneakers model.  What makes you think he knows or can express anything new or thoughtful about the human condition?  If you have come this far, just know there are alternatives...and hope.  There is a way out.<br />Don't buy this CD--you'll only end up hurting yourself and those you love the most.  Bob Marley sounds good, doesn't it?  Go pick up a new CD by Bob!  It'll make you happy.  Yup, just turn around and go back to the real music you've heard.  Remember, just because it's being played everywhere doesn't mean that you should buy it.  There you go...calm.

B000002MY3|5.0|Although this CD came out nine years ago, I'm absolutely hooked on it. Alanis is a musical genius. She has the uncanny ability to write powerful and deep lyrics without making them all sappy.   Here's my review of all 13 songs:   &quot;All I Really Want&quot;-6/5 I love this song. The lyrics are confusing at times, but they're great. One of my favorites on the CD.   &quot;You Oughta Know&quot;-6/5 Another of my favorites. It's an angry song, yes, but I love the chorus and the beat.   &quot;Perfect&quot;-5/5 This wasn't one of my very favorites, but I did like it. It's a very realistic portrayal of how some children's parents want them to be perfect.   &quot;Hand In My Pocket&quot;-6/5 One of my two all-time favorites. I love how the lyrics contradict each other (&quot;I'm broke but I'm happy/I'm poor but I'm kind&quot;) and it has a great beat.   &quot;Right Through You&quot;-5/5 This wasn't one of my very favorites either, but it's still a great song. I like the chorus on this one too.   &quot;Forgiven&quot;-4/5 This was a little hard, even for Alanis, but I liked it. Some people say Alanis was anti-God on this song, but I don't think so. In this song, she sings of rejecting her Christian upbringing, but now she wants to be forgiven for all she did, hence &quot;What I learned I rejected, but I believe again/I will suffer the consequence of this inquisition/If I jump in this fountain, will I be forgiven?&quot;   &quot;You Learn&quot;-6/5 A wonderful song about how you're always learning in life, even when you experience pain. It's a little more upbeat than some of Alanis's other songs, but I like that. One of my favorites.   &quot;Head Over Feet&quot;-6/5 What can I say? I love this song.   &quot;Mary Jane&quot;-4/5 An odd song and a little too slow, but still an outstanding job on Alanis's part.   &quot;Ironic&quot;-7/5 I LOVE THIS SONG!!!!!!! My favorite on the entire CD and probably out of all Alanis's songs. It's a powerful song about life's irony. I know I've been saying this a lot, but I love the chorus. It's my favorite part of the song. (&quot;It's like rain on your wedding day/It's a free ride when you've already paid/It's the good advice that you just didn't take/Who would've thought...it figures.&quot;)   &quot;Not the Doctor&quot;-5/5 I really like this song. Like &quot;All I Really Want,&quot; it's a little confusing at times, but it's still wonderful.   &quot;Wake Up&quot;-5/5 I like this one too, especially the last verse.   &quot;Your House&quot;-5/5 A hidden track that I didn't notice at first. This is acappella and very slow. Not the most fun song to listen to, but perfect if you want to hear Alanis at the height of her vocal powers. Her voice is absolutely flawless on this song.   All in all a phenomenal CD. I'll even go on a limb and say it's the best CD ever. I don't think that would be stretching the truth at all, though. It's rare to find lyrics that are so powerful and personal, yet so hard-rocking and fun to listen to. Alanis, you've done something I highly doubt anybody'll ever do again. Thank you.

B0000AGWJ7|2.0|The music on this cd is OK, ripping off Maiden, In Flames and other melodic metal - But the vocals and the production and image (not to mention lyrics) are pure teenage poser emo crap. This band has &quot;fake&quot; &amp; &quot;cute&quot; metal nicknames and they wear the latest trendy Hot Topic clothing. Sure the playing is competant - but it's an infiltration of Heavy Metal by some kids who probably made fun of metal music a few years ago. Hey - skulls are cool, lets make a scary band.
B00012QM8G|5.0|what a powerful, emotional masterpiece from the master himself!  like &quot;the passion&quot; there are times where you must turn your head away and others so gutwrenching and emotional, you will be weeping!  from the superb acting, to the incredible cinematography and beautiful musical score by john williams, this remains the ultimate classic after 10 years!  the dvd presentation, fully restored frame by frame and presented in gorgeous dts sound make this a must see-must own, rest assured, once seen you will never forget it. again, bravo mr. spielberg!
B0000DFZZC|5.0|Sensitive, heartfelt and heartwarming yet not maudling or corny.   This is one great Hollywood epic for everyone who roots for the underdog, er. . .horse.   Seabiscuit is an Equine &quot;Rocky&quot; for sure.  It may have you tearing up at times, but that's not bad in this case.  It's a great story and there's a happy ending too.   What more could anyone want?   Wish that horse were still around.
B00005JM4Z|1.0|I was absolutely SHOCKED when I saw that a director with the ability of John Singleton (Boyz N the Hood, Poetic Justice, Higher Learning) had crafted this mess.<br />There is just no plot, no script, sub-par effects, and atrocious acting.  When are people going to learn that Paul Walker's hair can't carry a movie.  If I heard him say \\"'bro\\" one more time I was going to throw my TV out a window.<br />If you have the option, just lay out the money to go to a car show.  You'll get to wander around as long as you want looking at all the tricked-out super-cars without all that annoying \\"movie\\" thing to get in the way.
B00012QM9K|3.0|Overall i think this film is worthy to own, i already have it on vhs and have been waiting for the DVD version. But in reading some earlier reviews i find myself agreeing with some of the film's detractors:<br />- the final factory scene/schindler's farewell are far too syrupy, it's almost embarassing to watch.<br />- there are certainly some drawn out sections in this film, a lot of time is spent on the relationship between goeth and his maid. and i'm not exactly sure why, we already know what kind of person goeth is by everything else he has done. why develop his character on this one point and leave out more important ones?<br />- there are quite a few scene and shot steals in this movie from previous works, i have a list of my own, but some other reviewers  have pointed out some additional ones.<br />- remember this is a piece of drama, not a historical document. there are better teaching tools in history books and testimonials rather than cinema.<br />In response to those who have complained that S-berg leaves out certain aspects of history, i think we need to remember that the story is simply about 'Schindler's List' and thus he really has no obligation to tell us everything that happened during the time period. Although, if you are paying attention, since the story is set in Krakow, those must be polish citizens thowing stones while the jews are being marched into the ghetto.. as is the boy drawing his finger across his throat as a train heads into auschwitz.<br />Finally, in goeth's speach during the camp's opening, i found it ironic that he would state that jews had been in krakow for 700 years, and that that presence was coming to an end. Not too far from Krakow is Breslau, a city that was thoroughly german for 700 years until the end of the war when it was emptied of its population (along with the rest of german Silesia) during the largest ethnic cleansing in europe's history.
B000003B6J|5.0|In 1988, millions of parents were left at home and scared because the gangsta rap group nwa were talking about real stuff, songs are as magnificent as it was today, this cd paved way for real gangsta rappers like Wu-Tang, Nas, Biggie Smalls, Ice Cube, westside connection, and of course 2pac shakur (the greatest rapper ever), but sadly Eazy-E Died, Ice Cube is on to movies and most of all dr. dre went into a selloutville thanks to his stupid white rapper (eminem) and a fake imitator<BR>who mumbles his voice to rap (50 Cent)<BR>Sadly Gangsta rap was never the same again right after tupac died.<BR>N.W.A Will always be the best thing in life.
B00006CXXU|4.0|Christina Aguilera has an undeniable voice.  All that wealth of talent coming from such a tiny person is nothing short of a gift.<br />The songs that brings forth her wonderful voice is &quot;Walk Away&quot;, &quot;Impossible&quot; (featuring Alicia Keys), and &quot;Beautiful&quot;.  The songs that gets you up is &quot;Can't Hold Us Down&quot; (Get up and sing it with her, girls!),  and &quot;Dirrty&quot;.  On all her songs, you can tell she is giving each song her best and deserved voice, and it is a well put together CD.  Not all of her songs catches my attention and keeps me tuned in, but the others make up for the others.<br />I like this CD.  It is a great listen, and yes, I want to dance when the right track hits.  Christina Aguilera has done well in her style of music.  I enjoyed it, and I'm glad I have it.
B00009Z574|5.0|I'm at a loss regarding the folks who hate this album. Truth be told, this is my FAVORITE YES ALBUM! I had it on 8-track, fell in love with it then, and still love it. Next favorite would be Going For The One, if that helps. Then Fragile, The Yes Album, and so on.<br />&quot;Circus Of Heaven&quot; gradually unwinds and unfolds into a lovely psychedelic canon - an actual bit of minimalism from Yes for you 128th-note, 11/7-time fiends (that means &quot;loser&quot; in english). Very lyrical, whimsical, and beautiful. &quot;Onward&quot; - lush atmospherics and harmonies. And there's a lot more here to love. The reviewer who said this was better than the Buggles stuff - verily I must protest-eth!
B00005ASHM|5.0|If you've made it to this page, you've probably heard a lot of people tell you about the historical significance of this album and it's influence, etc. But what's overlooked is that the Beach Boys are still the Beach Boys- only they sound even better than they did before. It's not the \\"left field\\" classic people seem to think it is, it's just a great bunch of songs everyone should like- because who doesn't like the Beach Boys, at least as a guilty pleasure? I suppose you could sum this up as nothing more than the Beach Boys beginning to realize that there's more to life than surfing, but before the point where the music became as much about drugs as it once was about surfing. The result: the very best of the Beach Boys. It's also a plus to have the mono and stereo versions, because it's difficult to decide which is better- the mono version sounds better at first, but on the stereo version it's nice to hear the sounds in more detail. There's a reason the Rolling Stones took out an ad in a London newspaper telling people to buy \\"Pet Sounds,\\" and why Paul McCartney still says \\"God Only Knows\\" is his favorite song. Even the cheesy intrumentals can't bring the rest of the album down- that's what the skip button was invented for.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I have loved Josh Groban's music since I bought his first CD, after hearing his music on the local radio station.  My favorites on this album are Oceano, My Confession, You Raise Me Up, and Never Let Go.  His voice just sends shivers down my spine!
B000025H0Q|5.0|I heard this album after I had already heard Five Leaves Left and Pink Moon, so I thought it was really weird to hear Nick Drake backed by a jazz band. It didn't seem to go along with him. But I listened to it while driving in a car at night on a rainy day, and it was perfect. I don't think the band dilutes him, I think it just makes this album very different from his two others.(which are definitely not identical to each other in the first place) Not only does it have different arrangements, it's more upbeat, musically if not lyrically. I really like the instrumentals, especially the title track- they're reminiscent of elevator music, but more energetic and more fun to listen to than anything that ever got played in an elevator. However, I can see why people complain, since in many songs, you have to listen hard to make out Nick's guitar. It's nice to hear John Cale on this album, I'm beginning to think that the six degrees of separation rule applies to session musicians as well as movie actors. Surprisingly, his distinctive viola playing suits Nick Drake just as well as it suited the Velvet Underground. This is probably the best of the \\"jazz-folk\\" albums of the late '60s and early '70s, it's more cohesive and balances the jazz and folk elements better than similar albums by Tim Buckley and Van Morrison, though both of them definitely did influence Drake. (Maybe it's not better than \\"Astral Weeks,\\" but it's about as good, and easier to listen to) It also must be mentioned that Belle and Sebastian, and several other indie bands, literally owe their sound to this album(especially \\"Hazey Jane II\\"). If you want music that sounds good on a rainy day, but isn't sleep-inducing, or depressing, this is it. Being in a part of the world where there is a lot of precipitation, this album is in my CD player a lot, and it's my personal favorite of Drake's three masterpieces.
0792843584|5.0|'This is the movie that sank United Artists'. 'This is the movie that annihilated the Western'. 'This should serve as a warning to any director prone to self-indulgence or producer flipping carte blanche to the film-making wind'.<BR>'Heaven's Gate' is the sorest, massivest victim of reputation in movie history. 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' has it as a reference point to unfairly breathe a sigh of relief at. It has historically been more of a victim than the victims portrayed within its vast expanse of celluloid masterpiece. Lambasted, pulled, cut, edited and commercially unrewarding, one thing it seems to have escaped is ridicule. There is a good reason for that but it will take seeing it to fully appreciate why.<br />Cimino was on a roll. Having taxied well up the runway with his Eastwood-cast movies, he climbed to a well and truly dizzying zenith in 'The Deer Hunter'. 'Heaven's Gate' should have been a duplicate in commercial terms.<br />It didn't happen that way. The 'why' element is flustering to mull over. Looking at the correlation between the significance of Vietnam in 1960s America and the Old West in America a century or less beforehand should have been able to keep 'Heaven's Gate' more than salient. Yet, cinema-goers were apathetic in 1980 to something that should have worked, that seriously had worked for them barely two years before.<br />Length shouldn't have had to matter, but that, coupled with the lack of a strong central character seemed to be the blamable factors for 'Heaven's Gate' dying night after night upon theatrical release, before having to be rushed back to the studio hospital for extensive surgery.<br />This truly is a case of 'why-o-why has this happened?!'. The positives are just staggering to behold, after all. Cinematography - perfect. Casting - perfect. Screenplay - (near) perfect. <br />The sum of the parts makes this movie too good to be true. Yet, even in execution, there was still the 'X' factor bestowed by Cimino's careful lens. Reality bled through in every nook and cranny, walked in every foot of so many hundred extras, while comic relief (I mean what else could John Hurt have done but serve as comic relief in this?) and firefighting choreography are through the log cabin roof. The sprawling action evades the need for focus on a solitary protagonist because that's the way it should be. The Johnson County war didn't happen in Hollywood so why should its recreation have? <br />'Heaven's Gate' will be resurrected, though it may take time. Yet, through DVD and video value or deluxe release, late night cable release and large-scale magazine or E-zine reviewing, it shall truly make it back to where it belongs. <br />This type of thing has happened before. It will happen again (rarely, though, given the downplay of the value of auteur cinema largely 'thanks' to this masterpiece). Herzog's 'Nosferatu' was another case of a high-energy attempt coming off looking-good and not quite making it. It's just too bad in this instance because Cimino lost a war in which he'd won every battle.<br />Art House cinema has many Christlike properties. It's a forgiving genre, here to teach us in ways we usually wouldn't dream of looking for or looking through. While it's arguable that the Spaghetti Western was borderline Art House in a few facets, 'Heaven's Gate' stands as the only true example. The gunplay is harrowingly real, the living is heart-wrenchingly real, the dying is virtually intolerable. Maybe that was the problem. The dawn of a new decade didn't want so much social conscience being portrayed and fun-loving cinema patrons seemed to be in tune with that sentiment. <br />Fickle things, movie-goers.
B0000VAFO0|2.0|Now, contrary to the title of my \\"review\\", I did not rent this film, and instead I purchased it. I had read other reviews, most of which were quite negative. This film, in my honest summation, is by no means a \\"great\\" film, especially when compared to much better films in its' genre.    The reason this movie was saved from the dreaded one star rating from me, was based on a few cosmetic and unrelated film factors. The originality of this film is somewhat bland, but usually when you prep for an early Fall film, that is what you should expect. There are some creative twists with the whole mixing of species between Vampire and Lycan races but that's where the creativity well runs dry.    The story of the film itself, is one of those over-told and overly clichéd tales of tragic love/embittered vengeance. The central plot is murky at best, and only barely believable. I personally found myself wanting the film to end at about the 45 minute mark, but forced myself to see it through to its two-hour finale in hopes that it might surprise me.    The dialogue is what drags this film down. Many people may disagree, and they are more than welcomed to do so, but for a film that claims its' primary focus is on action it seemed to rely heavily on overexposition to the point where it felt as if the story was constantly repeated just in case the writing team felt the audience had forgotten the entire reason they sat down to watch the film in the first place.    The quintessential \\"Matrix\\"-films rip-off of the \\"bullet time\\" special effects are used (Seen recently in every film since the first Matrix film first hit theaters), albeit briefly.    Granted, my review is based solely on my opinion of this film, and should be in no way the basis of whether anyone should like this film or not, but hopefully I've given some an idea of what to expect. I know I had slightly high hopes for this film, and was greatly disappointed when I watched it after purchasing it.     If you lower your expectations a little, you may come to find that you have a passable action film... but really nothing else.
0780626494|5.0|This is a nice, funny movie, which along the way makes an interesting point.  The plot is pretty straitforward, but this is a comedy not a drama, and it is plenty good enough to get us from joke to joke.<br />Films lately seem to be saying that really nice guys come from some other decade, or even century (Kate &amp; Leopold).  This might say more about the audience (do we more readily accept niceness if it is ancient?) than the writers, but it is something the film makes you think about, when you're done laughing.
B0000WN0VY|5.0|This is minor album in terms of greatness, but a great debut that shows the confidence Rice has in his songwriting.  It's unfettered by superfluous percussion and a rock rhythm section. There's also a slow charm that accompanies the songs, it never seems like it's in a hurry to express itself. A plus to this album is that it's so easygoing but not like easy listening at all. In comparison, it sounds like David Gray only in a more lyrical musical setting that's pretty sparse compared to the electronic work on &quot;White Ladder&quot; and full band arrangement on others, but not more sparse as his acoustic moments.  Gray is also a better vocalist than Rice because he knows his limitations better. Sometimes Rice will have a song that is out of his range and he'll just sing it with more passion.  It works, but it would be more powerful if he would just sing it in his own range. In terms of what the better album is, I'll leave that up to you. If you're in the mood for an acoustic album, then go for Rice's, it's consistently strong all the way through.
B000000OAA|5.0|My new purple shoes have been amazing the people next door.  And my Rock &amp; Roll 45s' been enraging the folks on the lower floor.<br />Why do you not have this album?  Sell your Duran Duran collection and get this NOW!!!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I just want to add my 5 stars to the 700+ reviewers before me! I love everything about this series-- characters, setting, and story.  It is sexy, smart, funny, and dramatic all at the same time. I loved the show when it was on and bought this DVD the minute it came out.  I was surprised how much better it was when I watched the series in order!  Bad, bad Fox.
B00012QM8G|5.0|I missed this film when it played in theatres, and only saw the PAN and SCAN video tape.   Due to picture and sound limitations, the film had nowhere NEAR the impact.   Only some eleven years after the initial release can I truly appreciate this remarkable achievement.  <br />Oddly enough, the DVD eidition of this film was released with seemingly little fanfare.  This really comes and no shock, as Saving Private Ryan, his second greatest feature, got similar treatment.  But since Schinlder's list is the most important and personal work of Speilberg's career, one would expect him to have done more in terms of extras.  From the razor-thin box to the single DVD contained inside, Schindler's packaging just FEELS wrong.  <br />But I'm really reviewing the film, and as it stands, it's one of the greatest pictures ever made.    <br />It's odd that Speilberg's greatest accomplishment took forever to make it to DVD.   Two years ago I asked for this DVD at Blockbuster video, and was astonished to hear that it didn't exist.  At last, we can see this all time classic at its absolute best.
B00013F38K|4.0|I've waited a very long time for this wonderful series to be available on DVD.  In my opinion this programme is one of the best to come out of the United States.  Those who consider this show to be racist have obviously never seen it.  I've also been told by my Chinese friends that it was extremely popular in Hong Kong which might suggest that they didn't consider it racist.  Contrary to popular belief, the show was not created by Bruce Lee or even with him in mind. Bruce Lee was apparently consulted for his technical expertise and not as a creative consultant for the development of the show.  <br />I also don't think that casting Lee as the main character (a 100% Chinese) would have made the show better.  The depth of the character comes from the fact that Caine was ostracized by Chinese and Americans alike.  He didn't fit into either cultural group and was beyond either stereotype.  This provides a strong message about racism and stereotyping that having a 100% Chinese character could not convey.  Carradine did a great job in the Caine role once he and the writers became comfortable with it.<br />I look forward to viewing this DVD release, especially for the beautiful background score by Jim Helms (a.k.a. Gerry Goldsmith?).
B00000IP4H|4.0|Okay, there is thrash metal, and there is death metal.  There isn't really an inbetween.  But for some reason (and I'm not complaining here) Testament disagrees with me and puts this thing out.  I'm giving it a 4 instead of a 5 because I'm comparing it to The Gathering and Low (not to mention The New Order and First Strike Still Deadly, and the classics, they're all great, but the new stuff is different to a large extent).<BR>This &quot;thing&quot; is one of the greatest metal albums I've ever heard.  Easily one of my favorites.  Okay, Low (the album right before this) was the rebirth of Testament, when they said F*** it!  We're going to get heavier and heavier until the record companies can't stand us anymore!  Then we will continue to get heavier after that!<BR>It didn't take long for Atlantic to dump Testament, which is surprising, because Low is one of the best Testament Album to date, if not, THE best because of it's variety.<BR>Demonic on the other hand, is a whole 'nother monster all together.  This thing sounds exactly like the title reads, Demonic.  Now the lyrics aren't &quot;kill your mother, burn virgins and drink the blood of the innocent&quot;, but the music itself just brings images of dark carnage into your head.  No easy feat with this crowd.  Demonic will always remain in my carrying case because there is no other album like it.  <BR>Chuck's vocals are as brutal as they ever were, and they still had clarity.  Eric's guitars were like an instrument of death, yet still fiercly melodic and catchy.  The bass and drums only kicked the intensity up a few notches.  I like it when I hear people complain about it not being all high pitched and full of 80's solos.  It means Testament did it right.  This wasn't designed to be an '80s album with solos and girly screams.  This was supposed to cram it to all of those people who thought Testament were getting soft.  And I have to say, this album is anything BUT soft.  It is beautiful, in a Demonic sort of way.<BR>No, I don't need counceling.
B000003TSP|4.0|All I can say is welcome to the &quot;Twilight Zone&quot;. Most anyone who knows their previous album &quot;Dummy&quot;, can pretty much expect the same thing on &quot;Portishead&quot;. This is a bit darker, and there's no obvious stand-out tracks, but as a whole it's still very strong, and sets a nice mood. This is actually one of my favorites of the genre, along with &quot;Mezzanine&quot;. &quot;Beth Gibbons&quot; continues to do an excellent job, and her voice really is a perfect match to the music. Overall, I'm not sure if I'd call it as good as &quot;Dummy&quot;, but it's the next best thing.
B000060P79|2.0|They can't hold a candle to Good Charlotte. GC actually has some good guitar parts and SOLOS (yes you heard me). SP has none of that. They play slow power chords with sappy lyrics that are copied off of Blink and GC but are not sung with nearly as much emotion. At least Good Charlotte's lyrics are different, this bands lyrics aren't, its all boring love songs that we've heard a billion frickin times... I gave them 2 stars because I like a few songs but thats all. And you know what, all you people need to stop b****ing over whats &quot;punk&quot; and whats &quot;poser&quot;. Good Charlotte have said themselves their not trying to be punk, so whats the use in arguing?
B00000JCB2|4.0|Remember in 1999 when these guys were everywhere and seemed inescapable? It was mostly because of what's on &quot;Significant Other&quot;. Not only was it released at the peak of their popularity, but it's also probably their best album. It's full of great tracks, including the aggressive &quot;Break Stuff&quot;, &quot;Re-Arranged&quot;, and the monster hit &quot;Nookie&quot;, but songs like &quot;Show Me What You Got&quot; and &quot;Just Like This&quot; rock as well. The days when &quot;Kid Rock&quot;, &quot;Korn&quot;, and &quot;Limp Bizkit&quot; ruled the earth may be over, but you can still throw on this disc and remember how much fun it was.

B000002LK1|4.0|Their album prior to this may have been called &quot;Music For The Masses&quot;, but this is the one that really made them huge. It's easily their most popular, and probably their best. It's a near perfect mix of alt-rock, goth, and electronica. This includes the hits &quot;Personal Jesus&quot;, &quot;Policy Of Truth&quot;, and the excellent &quot;Enjoy The Silence&quot;. But other tracks like &quot;World In My Eyes&quot;, &quot;Clean&quot;, and &quot;Waiting For The Night&quot; are just as good. They have many other great albums, but none of them are so short on filler. I think the better name for this might have been &quot;Sweetest Perfection&quot;. Almost half of these songs are on &quot;The Singles 86-98&quot; as well.
0060090367|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Claire's internal monologue.  The character has a conversation with her reader as she tells the story!  I love it!  The writing in this story was outstanding.  I kept thinking of when I could get back to Kate and her story!  :)
B00005ASHM|5.0|It's true this is one of the best albums of all time. I'm not sure if I'd call it the second best album ever (Rolling Stone), but it is amazing. Even though &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; as a whole is great, it's the hits that really stand-out, which include &quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice&quot;, &quot;Sloop John B&quot;, and &quot;God Only Knows&quot;. But I also really like &quot;You Still Believe In Me&quot; and &quot;Caroline No&quot;. Other than being a classic among classics, this disc also includes the bonus track &quot;Hang On To Your Ego&quot;, and the entire album is repeated in stereo on tracks 15-27. For all these reasons I highly recommend getting &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;. At least you should see what all the fuss is about.

This movie is absolutely brilliant and is one of the best movies ever made.  Definately give this movie a chance if you're interested.  I believe that the people that gave this movie bad reviews either:<BR>A) Didn't like the title thus not giving it a chance.<BR>B) Don't pick up on themes and would rather find appeal to Beavis and Butthead.<BR>C) Wanted something to complain about thus using this movie.
B000002MG1|1.0|On the list of the most annoying bands in the history of rock and roll, R.E.M. comes in at number three along with U2, the Cure, the Smiths/Morrissey, and Rage Against The Machine.  It was unfortunate to see America produce such a terrible band.<br />People talk about R.E.M. having under ground punk roots, but that sound is simply not there.  Just because they started out on an independent label doesn't mean they're punk.  It would be more accurate to call them the offspring of new wave, which was seen as a perversion of punk and one of the reasons (along with arena rock) why hardcore punk sprang up in America.<br />The worst part of R.E.M. has been Michael Stipe's mumbling, whining voice.  On \\"Automatic For The People\\" his wretched whining reached an all-time high.  \\"Everybody Hurts\\" has no redeeming qualities whatsoever.<br />The rest of the album is also an energy draining experience, sure to induce catatonia.  Not only does Stipe's voice convey absolute weakness, but the folksy music also wipes out any sign of hope.<br />America has a steady growth of self-proclaimed victims.  The last thing any artist needs to do is validate those attitudes.  Nobody needs this type of music, especially generation x.  They're better off turning their sadness into anger.
B000001ESN|3.0|Its a rather popular opinion that Rush went downhill following the release of Fly By Night. What could have been a serious rocking band was ruined by Neil Pearts overindulgence on wasted intellectual fodder lyrics and over-excessive drumming. The first album with John Rutsey was as good as it got with Rush. A debut album packed with serious rock songs, a guitar sound to rival Tony Iommi and groove like nobodys business. The follow up, Fly By Night, was right on target with killer songs like By Tor and Best I Can. Well, after this, it all went downhill rather quickly. The band decided against finding a real singer and decided it was cool to follow Neils new direction and thus ended any shot they had at real stardom and legitimacy. Permanant Waves isn't a bad album by any means but only when you hold it up against their first two albums do you stop and think &quot;where did this go wrong?&quot; Jacobs Ladder is the only song on this album that even heralds back to the once mighty rock unit. Neil is in full force with his songwriting, now used to having all his really important thoughts put to lyrics and trying to make Keith Moon sound like Ringo Starr with his inability to play a straight beat. So, if you're a fan of great rock n roll music, please pick up the first two Rush albums. Then listen to these from a distance and try to figure it out for yourself why they chose this direction when they could have had it all.
630463949X|5.0|Very well done. For the band that they were they do a show right. Good stage presence and smart enough to have back up musicians with them. This DVD is worth owning. If even for the nostalgia.
B000001ES9|5.0|Rush came out like a swinging giant. Their debut album packed solid with energy and vigor. The rock-solid drumming of John Rutsey was driving this young group of rock pioneers while Alex Lifeson had the greatest guitar sound of his entire career. So few bands get it right on their first album but Rush is the exception to the rule. There isn't one bad song on this album. The production is stellar, the lyrics are perfect; lacking all the pretentious ramblings of the future drummer, and the band fires on all cylinders. From the opening Finding my Way to the ultra-space heavy jam of Working Man, Canada's finest were in the running to put Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin in their places, both at this point long addled by drugs and success. You cannot buy a better Rush album than this. The follow up would be just as good but Caress of Steel marked the downfall of this once-great group. From there it went downhill fast but they left us with two amazing rock albums. Get em both!
B00005OM5L|5.0|With the exception of the dvd not being in wide screen format, This is a great DVD. Music is tight and song selections are wonderful. Buy it!! Eric is at the top of his game at this concert.

B0000648WZ|2.0|This is the epitome of a special-effects driven nightmare. If there is a story, it's a very understated one, but the move is &quot;colorful&quot; and mildly entertaining.  The FX are mind boggling, but the &quot;feel&quot; of th movie was too idiotic for me to give it more than 1 star, but the fact that Dina Meyer and Denise Richards were in it makes the movie watchable.  Other than that, the movie was bad in my opinion.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Each shot of this movie is beautiful.  The music is great.  The acting is great.  When it's over, you feel warm and fuzzy.  The DVD has a nice selection of extra features.  I found the behind the scenes making of the movie particularly interesting.  Rewatching the movie is like reliving a good dream. I've watched it about 10 times now and haven't gotten tired of it yet.
B0000089FS|1.0|I was so looking forward to getting this CD on the previous reviews.On listening to this CD thought the quality was terrble. In fact I wondered had it been produced in the two dollar shop.Very disappointed in the scratchy contents.
B000093BDX|5.0|Anyone cynical enough to regard this release with suspicion (I was) should give it to someone under the age of fourteen (I did; it was her thirteenth birthday) and watch what happens.  You can then 'borrow' it with impunity.  Besides, it has the mono-single version of 'Help Me, Rhonda', the Greatest Car Radio Song In The Universe Ever Bar None, which you can blast as you go cruising through the hamburger stand without your old man, man.
B00012QM8G|1.0|A great movie like this on a double sided disc???  You would think that after all the waiting for this DVD the product would be better....
B00005JN1L|4.0|Just seeing the preview got me hooked on this film.  I can't wait until it comes out.  I've read the short story: Secret Window, Secret Garden and I must say I was impressed.  I haven't seen it yet, but the film appears to follow the story of a writer who's just survived a nasty divorce only to find himself accused of plagarism and fighting for his life against a stranger calling himself John Shooter.  That's how it is in the book.  Hopefully they'll keep the shock ending intact, because it seems to be that no matter how hard they try, King films always fall apart near the end. Maybe this film will finally break the screen and clear King's name from failure to blinding success.
B000127LW2|4.0|\\"Voyager\\" was a great show in that fans got to go &quot;trekking&quot; back into space after having been stationed on &quot;Deep Space 9&quot; for a while and saying goodbye to the&quot;The Next Generation.&quot;  These  new &quot;Star Trek&quot; adventures would take place in a whole new quadrant of the universe - the delta quadrant - and would lead to a fresh new set of stories that didn't have to necessarily rely on what had gone before. A lone Federation ship and her crew having to deal with a whole new way of life, and many years before it could get home definitely appealed to me.  Also the fact that a female captain was finally cast in a leading role was certainly an excellent move. <br />My rating is for 4 out of 5 stars because I find the packaging annoying.  I don't like this split, clear slip-case, or whatever you want to call it, deal.  As these DVD's are $100 or more, better care should be taken in the way the package functions and in its appearance. The DVD's are just plain old silver with no fancy pictures on them, which is weird because DS9 had illustrated discs.  I guess I just expect a little bit more when it comes to packaging and the fact that this set only has 5 discs (only 15 episodes) I  feel a little bit skunked, considering the price.  Alas, the collector in me will eventually fork over money I don't have because I am an inveterate nerd.<br />Overall I enjoyed the first season of \\"Voyager.\\"  The extras were great and I finally got to see who was originally cast for the role of Captain Janeway and why she was wrong for the role.
B000001DWG|5.0|mother love bont however short lived was probably the best seatle band next to AIC, the music sounds like a mix of pearl jam and guns n roses,
B00008H2LB|5.0|too bad a lot of people put down this album. the beats and music are just too good. somehow, people compare linkin park to metallica...why? they are completely different. not only do they play different styles, but linkin park actually plays music whereas metallica bangs whatever they can find as hard as they can and call it rock music. not to mention screaming as loud as they can and calling that lyrics. linkin park is one of the better bands of today and you cant go wrong with this album. metallica is one of the worst bands in the history of music and should be boycotted.
B00000ING2|5.0|The amazing Coen brothers take us on a fantastic ride with The Hudsucker Proxy. Clearly, from the beginning to the end, you are emerged into a very surreal world set in the big city in 1940. Following the goofy, yet enjoyable Norville Barnes (Tim Robbins), we experience a rediculous ride to the top, and fall to the bottom. There are many things about this movie that just seem 'unreal', from the absurd dialogue, to the strange happenings, you get a sense of perfectness throughout the film, something that never happens in real life. I'd recommend this movie to anyone, especially Coen fans.
B000005HO0|5.0|This is a great album.It is the only album released with both Dead and Euronymous playing together.But why do people say this is the only album with the true lineup?Define true lineup.Dead was not the original singer,Maniac was.And Hellhammer was not their original drummer,Manheim was.Although Hellhammer is much better.But this is a great cd with lots of great black metal classics and the now deceased Euronymous and Dead RIP.But I think that the Deathcrush album should be considered to have the actual true lineup of mayhem.
B000002H33|5.0|This album is amazing, the first time i bought it in 1986, i was amazed. Every single song on this album is completely different from eachother. Put simply, this album rocks. I strongly recommend it to metal fans all over, although im sure you've all heard of this album, im recommending it anyway.<br />In 1986, Metallica released Master Of Puppets, it had no singles, but 8 tracks that will keep your head pounding.<BR>Here are the tracks with ratings:<br />Battery: The first track, and what an opening track. Starts off with melodic acoustics, and goes into raw and fast speed metal. An excellent opening song for a great album. The guitar solo is fast and will kill you on the spot. A+<br />Master of Puppets: Now heres a song that everyone loves, who doesn't know the Master! Master! chant. Master Puppets is a great song. 8 minutes of anger, and melody. This song has many changes. It starts of with an unforgettable guitar riff, into the chorus. Then without warning clean cut guitar harmonies break in. This song is truly one of their best. A+<br />The Thing That Should Not Be: This is another great. starts off with deep clean guitar, and into brutal-slow-death ear blowing distortion. James also uses some variety in his voice. Another great guitar solo in this song, a fast whammy bar wah wah solo. Theres nothing not to like about the thing that should not be.<BR>A+<br />Sanitarium: My Personal favorite on the album. Clean, Melodic, and tons of variety. starts off real slow with some natural harmonics, and into the opening riff, coming into the first solo. Breaks down into a verse, and straight into the chorus. The end is my favorite part, when James and Kirk play some great guitar harmonies. A+<br />Disposable Heroes: A pretty decent song, after all, the album wouldn't be complete without it. &quot;You will die when i say you must die!&quot; Great chorus, and overall a good song. A<br />Leper Messiah: This is another great one, very underated, but very good. Very original.another score for Master of Puppets. A+<br />Orion: Ah, yes, Orion. A great instrumental indeed. Wonderful harmony, and great riffs make this song great without lyrics. Job Well done!!! A+<br />Damage Inc.: Phew, Damage Incorperated, when I first heard this song, I thought I was going to die. Massive heart pumping energetic guitar riffs, pulsing drums, and great lyrics. Everything all in one package. A+<br />BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!
B000005HLV|5.0|De mysteriis dom sathanas is a great album.This is essential for everyone that listens to black metal.Pagan Fears is one of the best black metal songs ever written.Also check out the Deathcrush album.And why dont people like Attila's vocals?I think hes got one the most most dark and unique sounding voices in black metal.and for all you dumbasses who think Dead was their original singer,Maniac was in Mayhem before Dead was.so the singer they have now is actually their original singer.Get this CD,and Darkthrone &quot;Under a Funeral Moon&quot;,and Emperor &quot;In the Nightside Eclipse&quot; for some great,true black metal.
B000002H6C|5.0|What an album this is, an incredible masterpiece of raw brutal energy and great songwriting. In 1988, another metall masterpiece was released titled &quot;...And Justice For All&quot;. It is truly a great metal CD. Although Production was semi-poor, it was still and excellent CD, some of the harmony on this CD is unmatchable.<br />Here are the songs along with ratings:<br />Blackened: Starting off with backwards guitar, and going into an adrenaline rush, this song is a true opener. Good Harmony, and a hard ass solo at the end, amazing. A+<br />...And Justice For All: Another great song, filled with harmony and a great lead. 9 minutes of a great song, not alot can match it. A+<br />Eye Of the Beholder: A quite original song, with a fade-in at the beginning something that ive never heard before. good riffs, and a good guitar solo, and some good lyrics make this song great. A<br />One: Wow, One, is, simply put, one of metallica's most ingenius songs. metallica proves that simple opening riffs lead to an incredible song. This song starts off with war noises, and goes into the classic riff. two solos, and a guitar harmony which cannot be matched. A brutal ending, and a hell of a guitar solo.<BR>A+<br />Shortest Straw: The opening is, how you say, very heavy. brutal beggining, and a heart pumping song. Shortest straw is a nother good. A<br />Harvester of Sorrow: This is another good song, but is very repetitive at times which brings it a little lower in rating, but still a good song that fits a good album. A-<br />Frayed Ends Of Sanity: Were they on drugs when they made this? The beginning starts off with the Oh We Love The Old One from the Wizard of Oz, and goes into one hell of a song. A+<br />To Live Is To Die: I Love this song, another great instrumental, and a tribute song to one of the greatest bassists ever, Cliff Burton. A+<br />Dyer's Eve: what an ender, pure speed metal, great solo, powerful meaning, excellent song. A+<br />BUY THIS ALBUM I STRONGLY RECCOMEND IT!!!!!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|The people that wright good reviews of this movie must either be critics defending what they said, or freinds of the people who played in and directed this worthless movie. If movies like this were to become mianstreem I'd never go to the movies agian!!! I watched about half an hour of this movie and simply couldn't take any more of it, and I'm usually the type of person that gives these type of things a chance. I'll tell you what, intead of reading reviews of this waste of digital info go buy yourself a can of paint, apply liberaly, watch dry, tada youv'e just had twice as mutch fun as this piece of crap.
0385504209|2.0|When the book begins, it definitely hooks you in with its creative storyline, promises of secrets, conspiracy theories, etc.; however once the main characters leave Paris, the story becomes absurd.  As many other reviewers have said, the dialogue is horrible and ineloquent, the chapters are left with &quot;cliffhangers&quot; that are honestly really lame, and the lead character seems to know EVERYTHING.  I mean, can he be stumped for more than 5 seconds?  It gets so ridiculous.  I'm not going to reveal the ending, but the longer the book progresses, the worse it gets.  If you want a quick read with no pre-requisite for thinking, borrow it from the library.
B0001AP14E|5.0|This is a fantastic price for the hottest cd (besides outkast) out there. All of his beats are hot, but i expected that from him. But the thing thats best about him is that he can make tight beats and rhyme, and have a message on all of his joints. Thsi cd is a must own.
B0000WN0ZK|5.0|What can you say: it's a fabulous film and it's now available on DVD for the first time. Trust me, &quot;Blow-Up&quot; has never looked better, and it's in 16x9 widescreen. The VHS versions of Blow-Up have all been desaturated and washed-out in color, and when you see this DVD for the first time, you will be amazed at what a vibrant colorful film this is.<br />The sound quality is also far better than in any VHS versions before, naturally. There's also an excellent commentary soundtrack by a film expert that will heighten your knowledge and enjoyment of this now-legendary film by Michelangelo Antonioni.<br />I would tell fans to not hesitate to run out and buy this DVD and put any old VHS versions to rest. You won't regret the improved visual and sound quality and a chance to see Blow-Up like it probably hasn't been seen since the late 60s.<br />There could have been a few more extras such as any existing documentaries on Blow-Up or Antonioni, as well as actor commentary, etc, but what the hey. Often more extras just mean more fluff that force the MPG of the film to be further compressed and we wouldn't want that.
B000002B7M|5.0|Ther should be no arguing this: Blizzard of Ozz is Ozzy's greatest solo album to date.  I wish I could rate this album six stars, to tell you the truth.  The Ozzman's vocals are top-notch, Daisley and Kerslake keep excellent rhythym, and Randy Rhoads, God bless his soul, who is quite possibly one of the best metal guitarists in the world, is absolutely breath-taking.  No matter what anyone tells you, Randy is Ozzy's best guitarist to date.<br />1)I Don't Know - An awesome opener, though the one on 'Tribute' is WAY better.  9/10<br />2)Crazy Train - Oz's most popular song, and for a good reason.  What rock 'n' roll fan doesn't like this song?  The opening guitar riff is one of the best ever, and the solo is the coolest!  Daisley and Kerslake show their best work on this track.  10/10<br />3)Goodbye to Romance - I can't stand the way that some people make fun of this song. If you don't respect this song, you really can't respect Ozzy.  This is his best ballad (Next to 'Mama, I'm Coming Home')to date. 10/10<br />4)Dee[Instrumental] - Another underrated song.  Randy is an incredible classical guitarist, and this shows it.  This song was dedicated to his mother, Delores.  A pure masterpiece.  9.5/10<br />5)Suicide Solution - I absolutely love this song.  The only bad thing about it is that there was such a controversey over it. Again, the version on 'Tribute' is MUCH, MUCH better.  Randy's use of the whammy bar is the best on this track.  10/10<br />6)Mr.Crowley - This is my personal favorite Ozzy song.  The organ the beginning drags on a little too long (it takes up a whole minute of the song!), but it is made up for by Randy's jaw-dropping guitar work.  This was definitely Randy Rhoads's shining moment.  11/10<br />7)No Bone Movies - The weakest track on the album, though I'm not complaining.  The solo on this song is great, and it's the only song that Lee Kerslake is credited with being a drummer on, for some odd reason.  8/10<br />8)Revelation(Mother Earth) - A greatsong, written about the world being polluted and destroyed.  The solo at the end is excellent.  9/10<br />9)Steal Away(The Night) - A great song, though it is easily forgotten because of the fact that it's at the end.  The solo is too short, which is the only problem with it.  8.5/10<br />To sum it all up, this album is a must-have, whether you like heavy metal, rock 'n' roll, classical, or soft rock.  There is something on this album for everyone.  I actually have the ORIGINAL original, not the 2002 remaster or the 1995 remaster, which is the best.  When you hear people telling you that the original has the word &quot;OZZY&quot; down the side with a smaller picture in the middle, they are either mis-informed, or they're just lying.  The original has a very small black border around the outside, with the old 'Compact Disc' Logo in the bottom right corner.  Anyway, simply put: YOU CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT THIS ALBUM!!!<br />Peace, everybody, and keep rocking.
0385504209|5.0|I recently finished reading the Da Vinci Code and thought it would be fun to see what other readers thought about it.  I personally felt that the novel was one of the best I've ever read.  After viewing this page, I was shocked to see so many bad reviews were given to the novel.  Most of the bad reviews sound like they were given by people who have never even read the novel.<br />  Like ceruleana, the novel opened new doors for me.  I learned so many shocking things about the history of religion that I have begun passionately researching the topic.<br />  This novel is definitely worth reading!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|As a big Bill Murray fan, and after reading all the good reviews, I lined up to see this movie the day it opened in my area. What an incredible disappointment. I can only attribute it to Sofia getting a free ride on her daddy's name (again). There should be an Oscar for &quot;most over-rated&quot;. This would take the cake, maybe of all time.
0060977493|2.0|The novel is about a pair of fraternal twins who have been separated for 23 years and have to take down all their barriers to restore their bond emotionally. The reading level is high and uses difficult and flowery words. Also the story is difficult to follow because of the way the author goes back and forth in time so freely not giving much background to the story until the very end. The book is also for more mature readers because of the vivid account of a boy being sexually assaulted, the abuse of many wives, and the incest that goes on in the story.  The plot is overall uneventful because of the way the book manoeuvres from memories to present, once you figure out that the story takes place in one day you find the story not fulfilling and has no point. The ending also (because the fate of the characters is also given to us) should have been more optimistic, giving light for a better future, instead the readers already know what happens to the characters so the optimism is lost.
0099468042|5.0|I read my first \\"regency romance\\" from Ms. Heyer at the age of 13, and a few decades later still go back to my favourites. This story is definately one of them.<br />For anyone who isn't already a fan of Georgette Heyer's largest group of books, this wonderful lady, writing in early and mid 20th-century England, produced a glorious collection of romances set in Regency England,(while all the time despising these best-selling books that took her away from the straight historical books she really wanted to write, but wrote more slowly.) (Oh yes, she also wrote some pretty good murder mysteries too, but this isn't one of them.)<BR>Her many fans are really pleased she did have these economic needs, because we find her romantic novels enjoyable again and again, and don't care about a few (paltry) flaws.  <BR>Georgette Heyer's romances stand out from all others, to me anyway, because of the great sense of humour and wit that makes all of the books great fun, the easy to read style that never becomes banal, and plots which, although always happy-ending and sometimes rather similar, are never, ever, boring. If you like romances that are well-written, without taking themselves too seriously, and you're happy to know the right guy will always get the (sometimes wrong, but always feisty, and never insipid)  heroine, try her books. You'll likely get hooked, and then be delighted to find there's plenty more (though not always in print).<br /> I probably call this book 'gentle' because the hero isn't apparently hateful, or offensive or caustic, just very likeable and somewhat thoughtless. There is one truly bad guy, whose inner wickedness is revealed gradually, and that anyone familiar with Heyer's books will pleasantly anticipate eventually getting his due, and there's  an unpleasant (and very silly) mother-in-law, but this book has much less black/white stereotyping than some of Ms.Heyer's other books.<br />What keeps me enjoying \\"Friday's Child\\" again and again is the broad range of characters included in the tale. With the hero's three friends, all very clearly different, playing their own parts in the twists and turns of the plot and general misunderstandings, plus various relatives contributing their own little cameos, there's plenty of variety in the story. After reading this book I always feel that I've met (or meet again) a nice assortment of different characters, none of them perfect, but most very likeable, with a few wonderfully unlikeable for contrast.<br />Like all of Georgette Heyer's Regency stories you get a great (and well-researched) trip back into Society life during the Regency period, but this typically-Heyer gem gives you  more. There's the wonderful range of characters you are shown, plus more enjoyment of the of the secondary personalities . In this picture of Regency England you learn more than the all-important niceties of \\"good ton\\" and \\"NOT good ton\\", you are introduced to some varied aspects of  society. The nobility you meet include the honest and the phony, the noble-but-nasty and the basically-decent, the thoughtful and impulsive, sensible and silly, and you also glimpse characters from the rest of society, living in a  version of England that's very different from that of the main protagonists.<br />All in all, this is another glorious read from the much loved Georgette Heyer. If you've read her other books, be prepared for some delightful  hours, and if this is a more mellow read than some, with a bit less life-and-death drama, the pleasure is no less, with lots of fun and variety, and if you roughly guess the ending (pure Heyer) there's a load of very believable ups-and-downs before you get there. If you are new to this author, (and you don't despise happy endings), you're in for much fun.
B00008DDSC|4.0|This film could easily have been the S/M crap feast that 9 1/2 Weeks was, but a fine sense of humor and a pleasurable tendency of the script, director and actors to play this straight makes for a fine film experience.  The script walks a tightrope between humor and parody and finds the right tone throughout.  The gal who plays the secretary is a revelation.  The humor doesn't arrive from sniggering at the sex antics but from the interplay between characters.  Very nicely done.

B00000JCB2|1.0|I would give this CD a rating of zero stars if possible.  Their sound is terrible and in no way should it be considered music. I don't see how people sit down and listen to this trash. When people use curse words in their music they think they are good or that the use of the words makes them good. That makes me sick that people could even call this music!!!
B00000F5KH|5.0|An emotionally spellbinding masterpiece is what we have here. Everything about this film adds up to give us a film that is beyond your average tear jerker, it is an unforgettable story about what it means to be human. It is about priorities, family and the concsiounce (sorry, I need spellcheck).<br />Get the plot gist from other reviewers, I'd just like to throw in my 2 cents and let all who care to read how wonderful this film is.
0385510438|2.0|I used to be an avid John Grisham fan.  I would anxiously wait for his books to come out and be one of the first to purchase a book.    Lately, his books have strayed and have not caught my interest.   This book sounded like it could be in line with his first books, so I was anxious to read it.  I can usually finish a Grisham book in less than a day... this one dragged for about a week.  I forced myself to finish it so I could start a new book.  The main character is not very interesting and it makes it hard to feel any involvement in the choices he makes in his life. If John Grisham continue the same trend, I will have to find a new author to enjoy.
0930289234|5.0|Having long heard Watchmen's praises, I resisted reading it because I dislike the late 80's and 90's ultraviolent comics, and I assumed Watchmen to be the quintessential comic of this type. I've finally read it, and I was wrong. It deserves its reputation. Violence serves theme and plot without being exploitative.<br />SPOILER: I'll discuss the story's ending. I'll also compare Watchmen to other works, such as Kingdom Come.<br />I think Watchmen is basically a condemnation of ubermensch theory (Nietzsche's idea that \\"supermen\\" are entitled to violate society's moral laws, imposing their will on those \\"inferior\\" to themselves.  Hitler infamously used the theory to justify Nazism. I concede I am no expert on Nietzsche.), and an accusation that superhero stories endorse this philosophy by lionizing vigilantes. Watchmen also attacks the genre's simplistic good vs. evil morality.<br />Only one character has \\"superpowers\\" to justify claims of superiority, yet Dr. Manhattan takes too little interest in human affairs to want to control others. On the contrary, he lets himself be used as a tool, hoping to retain his humanity by pleasing people. Yet he's now too detached to morally judge his orders, becoming a living military weapon. Apparently, desire for power over others is for mortals living among mortals--like Ozymandias, the archetypal Aryan \\"superman\\": a blonde, blue-eyed, physically perfect, supremely brilliant, self-made billionaire.<br />Achieving peace through slaughter, Ozymandias, like his hero Alexander, embodies Nietzsche's belief that ends justify means. If paradise is attainable through atrocities, as Nazi and Soviet propaganda claimed, is it worth it? And, once the eggs are broken, should one reap the benefits of the sin? (I ask this sitting comfortably in California, stolen first from Native Americans, then from Mexico.)<br />Rorschach--Watchmen's brutal, uncompromising conscience--says no, and his journal seems to give him the last word. Yet Rorschach tortures for information, sometimes needlessly. Besides, his winning may mean Armageddon.<br />In keeping with a thought experiment in Nietzsche's worldview, Watchmen's universe is an apparently godless one, as stated by several characters. Crime and Punishment's Raskolnikov justifies murder through Neitzschean arguments, but then feels remorse and, through this reluctant acceptance of higher morality, comes to believe in God. C.S. Lewis's arguments in favor of God's existence hinge on morality's independence of human preference. Watchmen's ending is too ambiguous for any divinely transcendent morality or providence to be clear to the characters or reader. As a Christian, I acknowledge the realism of this ambiguity, for even assuming that God exists and His will constitutes absolute morality, His moral intent is rarely as discernable in real life as in melodramas (the classic example of divine inscrutibility being Job's sufferings in the Bible). As Hollis Mason says in chapter 3, \\"Real life is messy, inconsistent, and it's seldom when anything really gets resolved.\\"<br />I like Watchmen--but fear I now better understand why the genre degenerated following its publication. It's a damning attack on superheroes, yet publishers couldn't stop printing their bread and butter, so self-indictment pervaded superhero books of the following years as they struggled with Moore's accusations. Also, as Neil Gaiman observes in his introduction to Busiek's \\"Astro City: Confessions,\\" the easiest \\"riff\\" of both Watchmen and Miller's \\"Dark Knight Returns\\" for hacks to steal was darkness, not depth.<br />There are other reasons for the so-called \\"Iron Age's\\" violent nihilism besides Watchmen and DKR's influence. Such trends were already growing in early 80's comics. DC had ravaged almost its entire stock of characters in 1985's \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths.\\" There was also the need to satisfy reader bloodlust once the maligned Comics Code, for better or for worse, became a rubber stamp. Universally recognized characters synonymous with virtue in the public imagination became brutal, wrathful, petty--and if heroes became jerks, villains became the most lurid sadists imaginable. This culminated in the near-plotless splatterpunk and exploitative sadism of the early Image Comics. \\"Good vs. evil\\" became \\"merely evil vs. nauseatingly evil.\\" Moore expressed dismay that things took the direction they did in those years.<br />Watchmen's theme is: if Nietzsche were right, as superhero comics claim, that would be terrible. It took a decade for superhero writers to rebut this accusation. Their answer came in Waid and Ross's \\"Kingdom Come\\" and was: We never claimed Nietzsche was right--the essence of superheroes is that the stronger someone is, the LESS excuse he has to abuse the weak, and the greater his obligation to them. (As Stan Lee wrote years earlier: \\"With great power there must also come--great responsibility!\\" Or, as Moore himself has Superman say in Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?, \\"Nobody has the right to kill... not [even] Superman. Especially not Superman!\\") KC portrays a higher morality--indeed, a God-given one, delivered through the mortal Norman McCay. Perhaps it requires divine perspective to see that an ant who can shatter mountains is no better or worse than his fellow ants. Unlike Watchmen, but like most superhero comics, most of KC's characters have \\"powers\\"--flight, invulnerability, etc.--differentiating them from general humanity in a way that even bullet-catching Ozymandias is not. Yet they're not blessed/burdened with near godhood like Dr. Manhattan (staggeringly powerful even by superhero standards, Manhattan perceives all moments simultaneously, and creates and destroys life at will. He has no common reference with humans.). Powerful, yet mortal, they have no more free license to sin than anyone. Probably less. KC portrays a world which needs to relearn this, just as the comics industry needed to relearn it. (One shortcoming: unlike Watchmen, KC isn't self-contained. It assumes reader familiarity with Superman, Batman, etc. and with ultraviolent comics. )<br />KC and Watchmen bookend the Iron Age. Watchmen unintentionally (I say unintentionally because Moore apparently laments the fact) helped begin it, and KC helped end it.<br />Yet despite spawning these trends, Watchmen itself is breathtaking, complex literature which takes masterful advantage of comics' visual medium.<br />Warning: This is not an acceptable comic for children. An R-rated story with lots of sex and violence, Watchmen is a story for grown-ups.rsally recognized characters synonymous with virtue in the public imagination became brutal, wrathful, petty--and if heroes became jerks, villains became the most lurid sadists imaginable.

1401300901|3.0|This author has potential.  I really liked the general idea and storyline of the book due to its creativity.  The writing is a little forced and often not very smooth.  I enojoyed this book better than some others in the chick-lit category as it was a little bit less predictable.
B0001ENYKS|5.0|As most people reading about this band, I first heard of Franz from their wonderful Darts of Pleasure EP and couldnt wait until their first album came out. For those of you who thought that it would dissapoint, well, in basic terms they havent. This is the best CD of the year so far and could be the choice for CD of the year when all is said and done. To the detractors who said that they were too much like Interpol on the EP, those claims cant be made on this one. This is darker and more complex than any of their previous work. The only two songs I didnt really like were \\"Cheating On You\\" and \\"This Fire\\" which follow one another on the cd. I also wished that they included \\"Shopping for blood\\" on the debut but you cant have every ssong from the EP so i am not too dissapointed. Most of the songs on this CD are punky dance numbers that revolve around lust but some of their better songs are . My two favorite songs are \\"Auf Asche\\" and \\"Michael\\". A great debut by a band everyone should listen to but most people wont.

I like the arrangements of strings on this work, as well as the smooth percussive thrills.<br />Somehow through taking the Sade journey, we are made to feel comforted despite life's sorrows. Her ability to traverse the blues with such funky compositions makes works like this worth returning to time and time again.<br />Before we heard the name Norah Jones we were soothed by the gentle sounds of Sade; and thank God we can continue to experience that joy while bearing witness to the many artists influenced by her grandeur.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|i'd like for you to imagine that, all of your life, everything you like is stupid. you read the reviews of movies, books, albums... all the ones you hate/don't get/find boring? &quot;five stars! bravo! oscar/grammy/pulitzer worthy!&quot;. the ones you love? &quot;average at best! awful! tripe!&quot;. i'd think by now you people would figure out that your taste is steering you wrong. LOST IN TRANSLATION is one of the top three films of 2003, hands down. you didn't like it? that just means you wouldn't know a good film if it bashed you in the face. so why the need to remind us all of your ignorance by posting away like a frothing moron about how &quot;boring&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; it is? for your own sake, just remind yourself after seeing the next challenging film to come down the pike (probably ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND) that yes, you are an idiot, and no, you don't need to run to the imdb or amazon.com to remind us all of that fact. thank you.<br />oh yeah, the dvd is pretty nice, except that the packaging/artwork sucks. pretty much everything you could want in a dvd release is on the disc though.
B000060P79|1.0|First of let me state that I'm not biased towards bands like A Simple Plan. I'm not the type of person to say they are whiny little Emo kids. I actually think bands of Simple Plan's genre are quiet good such as Blink 182, but Simple Plan makes Rock music look bad.  First off these guys are not the slightest bit original or creative.  Most of their songs are in basic 4/4 timing made up of three or four things guitarists call power chords.  Power chords are the basic building block chords for most songs.  Yes many musicians use power chords now days but it is incredibly unoriginle when this band continously uses the same rhythms and the same four chords over and over again.   The Ramones did it in the 80's, Green Day did in the 90's lets stop the nonsense. <BR>   Most songs by this band start out with a simple guitar riff.  Yes, simple is sometimes good by Simple Plans riffs have been used by all other pop punk bands in the 90's and early millenium.  Their songs sound like what Blink on Enema of the State and what Green Day did on Nimrod.  When I first heard this album I feel like I've heard there songs before.  The riffs were so overused and recycled by punk guitarists.  <BR>   Next comes the singer.  Besides having a voice that is disitrbingly high, it is also very whiny and annoying.  He sounds like A New Found Glory's singer but with a whiny voice.  The thing that bothers me most about the singer is the lyrics.  Every song is a sob fest about A)How he has no friends B)How his girlfriend moved away or C)How his parents don't pay attention to him.  Their is nothing interesting or poetic about the lyrics.  I could have written the lyrics in five minutes.  Heres an example of a song that they could have written:&quot;I have no friends, my girlfriend hates me, I wish I died.&quot;  It also bothers me to hear an upperclass white kid with a privaledged life, singing about how bad of a life he's living.  News Flash to the singer: There are people that have a life that is10 times worse than yours.  Go to some poor areas in Africa and then complain to me you whiny pansy.  It seems they just use a sad, depressed image to win teenage fans who are depressed.  <BR>    When I listen to music I want something interesting and fun.  A Simple Plan is your generic Pop-punk band that will make you say, &quot;How the hell did they become big.&quot;  If you like pop-punk pick up the new Blink-182 cd or Green Day's Nimrod.
B00006IU73|5.0|Every now and then, our generation is blessed with an amazing, road-paving, groundbreaking band that takes its lessons well from previous masters. Steven Wilson's Porcupine Tree is one of those groups. Being from England, and with many songs that bear a shocking resemblance to certain Pink Floyd tracks of the glory days, one would think that Tree is a Floydian rip-off. BUT...I am happy to announce to all of you that Steven Wilson enjoys many influences, and upon buying this album, you will hear a collection of styles unlike anything you have likely heard before. Ranging from hard rock, to progressive, to psychedelic, to pop fusion, there should be something to satsify every fan of melodic music on this album.<br />Standout Tracks: Trains, The Sound Of Muzak, Gravity Eyelids, 3, Blackest Eyes, Prodigal, Strip The Soul, Heartattack In A Layby

Get out there and go make me some more money!\\"<br />Blessed was the fact that flesh selling had not ravaged Vivian's body nor subjected her to countless potentially lethal forms of sect-chew-Ali transmitted ills.<br />Blessed was the fact that Vivian really had more of the intelligence and personality that suited her to garden parties than to a life of flesh selling on the streets.<br />Blessed was the way that Vivian transformed Edward from a morose and heartless destroyer of other people's livelihood into a saint who would gladly fork over some investment capital to try to make a failing business succeed.<br />Blessed was the fact that this capitalized on the hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold stereotype that's been with us since biblical times.<br />Blessed was the fact that this film ended.<br />Blessed was the fact that I never saw it again.<br />Blessed was the fact that my students in Taiwan really liked it and asked me what I thought of it. <br />Blessed was the fact that I said, \\"Well, I think it teaches girls that hooking is a pretty viable career choice.\\"

B00007E8NP|3.0|This SACD is a disappointment. The album is decent, but I was looking forward to hearing it in 5.1. This doesn't really sound any better then the original cd. After hearing Elton John's Yellow Brick Road in SACD, this SACD does not compare in sonic quality. By the way, I was never really an Elton John fan, but after listening to that excellent SACD release, it is obvious that Elton influenced Ryan Adams' lyrical style quite a bit. Anyway, stick with the original cd and save some money.

B000002H97|5.0|Although many people may consider this album as the downfall of Metallica, it has well proved itself as being one of the greatest albums of all time. The album delivers one incredible track after another. Even though it doesn't sound like anything from their previous albums, it still stands alone as a powerful album that any real fan can enjoy.  Even though Metallica changed drastically over the years, the five incredible albums from Kill em All to the Black Album should be owned by all fans.
B00005JLRT|2.0|Only, this time the special effects are MUCH better.<br />Really, Nemesis is a spectacularly uninspired film that covers no new territory.  I myself, as a dedicated Star Trek fan, felt doubly cheated because the Romulans (otherwise ignored on the big screen throughout Star Trek's many films) played second banana to the weird Reman plot line and the even more improbable Shinzon story.<br />BEWARE, SPOILERS BELOW!<br />I can best sum up my problems with the film in the form of unanswered questions.  Like, how are the Remans at once slaves to the Romulans, but also capable of assembling, manning, and using the gigantic Scimitar spacecraft to basically take over the Empire?  Even if the Remans are part of the Romulan military industrial complex, and are able to create and man the Scimitar, why are there no Romulan officers onboard to maintain control and allegiance to the Empire?  If Shinzon is a failed Romulan experiment, why is he not simply killed, instead of being dumped into the Reman mines as a slave?  What use do the Remans themselves have for a weakling human, and why in the world do they take that boy, raise him up, and make him their leader?  How does Shinzon even know who Picard is, much less how he himself was cloned from Picard?  Why have the Romulans told him anything about his origins, and why does Shinzon then need to 'get even' with Picard, or destroy Earth and the Federation at all?<br />And so on, and so forth.  And I've not even touched on the ridiculous B4 plotline, which is a distraction all the way through the film, seemingly in place only so that Data can be killed off and then, in some future film perhaps, brought back into action as his engrams rise to the surface in B4 thereby turning B4 into Data all over again.  This deus ex machina robs Data's death of any significance whatsoever, because it becomes painfully obvious that if B4 has 'imprinted' on Data, eventually he will assume Data's personality, memories, capabilities, et cetera.  Or at least that was the impression I was left with.  Frankly, Star Trek has already been down this road once already with Spock; and it's a road Star Trek doesn't need to go down again!<br />Indications are that this is the final Star Trek feature film; or at least the final feature using the Next Generation cast exclusively.  Will some inspired person somewhere find a way to bring Nick Meyer back for a third outing, with an appropriately sturdy script?  He rescued Star Trek from its first feature film, then rescued Trek again from its fifth, and might be the perfect director to rescue Star Trek from its tenth.  We've got potential cast members from three television series that might be tapped.  The aftermath of the Dominion War has only been briefly touched upon.  A smart script might combine these characters and these elements into a nice movie, taking the Star Trek films in a new, necessary direction.<br />Or maybe Star Trek has simply run out of gas?  Speaking as someone who grew up on the old 60's Star Trek, then the first few films, and then eventually the new television series, I've been pleased with the overall longevity of the franchise, even if the individual parts that make up its whole are not always what I'd like them to be.  I could live with this franchise being put out to pasture, as it seems all good things must truly end sooner or later.  Especially if the future of Star Trek is as forgettable as Nemesis, better to let it die with honor than live on its knees, begging for an audience.east that was the impression I was left with.

B000000ISR|5.0|Nearly any Clapton album would be nice enough to own, (particularly those from his early days) but an album containing the talents of both Clapton and Duane Allman is truly remarkable.  Their meeting is almost legendary, and the inevitable result was Clapton's invitation extended to Allman for a recording.  What ensued was their creation, &quot;Layla and Assorted Love Songs.&quot;  The music itself is a combination of blues standards, (&quot;Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out&quot; and &quot;Key to the Highway&quot;) Clapton's ballads (&quot;Bell Bottom Blues&quot; and &quot;Why does Love Got to be So Sad&quot;) and good ol' fashioned rock (the title track, and Hendrix's &quot;Little Wing&quot;).  The album came during Clapton's depression as a result of his love for George Harrison's girlfriend at the time (Harrison being his best friend).  The resultwas pure magic, and the song &quot;Layla.&quot;  Clapton was in fact too bashful to use the lady's name, and instead substituted the name of a Persian legend, Layla.  Allman filled in on slide guitar, along with &quot;Key to the Highway&quot; while Clapton sung his heart out.  Bobby Whitlock's organ and piano melds beautifully with the blues from Clapton and Allman, and percussion from Jim Gordon and Carl Radle is a nice compliment.  Although all the songs on this venerable album are good, the title track smokes, while &quot;Have You Ever Loved a Woman&quot; brings in the blues and &quot;Little Wing&quot; veers off into Hendrix's psychadelia.  It makes for a powerful work.  In all seriousness, this is a must-have.

B000002KKS|5.0|Hey nu-metal kids, Sabbath was kicking ass way before Limp Bizkit was a wet dream in the record company's mind.  Dio vocals kill, as of now, I cannot find anyone (rock/pop/other) who has the range, power, and intesity of Ronnie James Dio.  Not say the other Sabbath members should be forgotten.<br />Iommi, has to be one of the most underrated guitar players of all time.  He consistanly rocks, even if the rest of the band isn't up to par. (***Please note this is not in reference to this album***)  I can say that Iommi's riffs could easily hold up with modern nu-metal with Iommi crushing the compotision.<br />As I said in the &quot;The Mob Rules&quot; review, Gezzer can be heard on this album and it is killer.  Bill Ward is another serverly underrated palyer in Sabbath.  He can go at it with anyone for that era (But he does fall to John Bonham).<br />&quot;Neon Knights&quot; gets this album rocking, and it doesn't stop.  See other rockers &quot;Wishing Well&quot;, &quot;Heaven &amp; Hell&quot;, and &quot;Die Young&quot;.  Sabbath put out two awesome records with Dio and two of my favorites.  Also the artwork for both &quot;Heaven &amp; Hell&quot; and &quot;The Mob Rules&quot; are on my list for coolest of all time.
B00018D44U|5.0|Unlike pop musics belt-it-out-bimbos, who confuse emotional singing with bellowing and sensuality with sexual license, Norah Jones draws the listener in to her intimate world with subtle vocal touches.  Check out the emotional intensity in her voice when she sings the line Funny how my favorite shirt/ smells more like you than me in In the Morning and the vulnerability conveyed in Humble Me.  And rather than playing the role of a sex-kitten, she comes across as a mature sexual partner who can turn you on because she knows what turns her on.  After listening to her songs, you not only want to spend the night with her but also want to cook her breakfast and discuss your fears and desires.<br /> Others have commented that Feels Like Home is more of a country album than a jazz album, but I think such categorization doesnt do Norah  justice.  She does borrow elements from country (or more specifically, bluegrass) to get that high-lonesome feeling on songs like Creepin In (deciding to do a duet with Dolly Parton was a brilliant move, by the way), and the arrangements seem to reflect a singer-songwriter sensibility.  However, what makes this all work is the jazz chops of the singer and the band.  Perhaps a comparison would help explain what I mean: whereas Joni Mitchell started out as a folk musician who experimented with jazz, Norah is jazz musician who experiments with folk, country, and blues.<br /> I cant close this review without mentioning the first single, Sunrise. From George Bushs militant cowboy rhetoric to Mel Gibsons brutal religiosity to the FCCs sanctimonious indignation, the world is filled with angry voices that attack us day-in and day-out.  When I first heard Sunrise, it gave me a feeling of inner peace that renewed my faith in humanity.  Too grand a statement to make about a pop song with less than poetic lyrics? Perhaps.  But sometimes the tiniest things can help us take the first steptoward renewal.
B000002KMY|5.0|For all of those &quot;classic&quot; Sabbath fans who listen to Ozzy era Sabbath, open your ears and crank it up.  I have seen the Ozzman, and his vocal are hit or miss, the studio is about the same.  As for Dio, the man is on the money every time.  <br />I got Dio's &quot;Holy Diver&quot; before I got &quot;The Mob Rules&quot;, and Dio is incredible.  I have heard &quot;Dehumanizer&quot; and I was not impressed at all.  It had a good concept, but simply falls flat.  I thought there was no way Dio could top &quot;Heaven &amp; Hell&quot;'s performance, the same goes for the rest of the band.  Iommi shreds like a madman on this record.  Gezzer, who I have noticed is hard to hear, but not on this album.  Vinnie Appiece apparently had some of his brother talent rub off on him.  He is no Bill Ward, but he is a sutiable replacement.<br />As for the songs, &quot;Turn Up The Night&quot; ranks as one of my all time favorite Sabbath tracks.  &quot;The Sign Of The Southern Cross&quot; is classic doomy Sabbath.  &quot;The Mob Rules&quot; is another fine rocker, with flash and balls.<br />Overall, the album could have been titled &quot;Heaven &amp; Hell Part 2&quot;, but it has a life of it's own.  Though Sabbath lost most of their fan base, I recommend checking out some of the Tony Martin era albums.
B000077VR3|5.0|I think that MR is one of the best musicals I have seen in long time, and MR is also Baz's best movie.<BR>The movie starts with wild dance scenes and fast editing until the other part that ends up with tragedy.<BR>There is new versions of classic songs like 'Lady Marmalade', 'Like A Virgin' and 'Roxanne', while 'Zidler's Rap' and 'Can Can Can' is some of the new songs.<BR>Forget about Lord Of The Rings - FOTR, and watch MR instead, there is more excitement.
B0000AK7AB|5.0|an absolute classic one of kind movie that shows hollywood still makes great movies...  by the way my rca dvd player has no problems skiping over the previews. so those ones that complained about it dont listen.  if they would spend more than 50 cents for their dvd players and stop complaining they would enjoy this great motion picture.  morons!! and they wonder why america is so fat too lazy to press a button even if they have to watch a few trailers big deal. did they think about scene access??????????????????????
B00003CXXP|5.0|While Harry Potter and Lord Of The Rings - FOTR had a big time at the cinema's box offices, was A.I. failing instead, and mabye because it was more different and not so easy to follow.<BR>This is not the typical feel good comedy or action movie they are showing on the TV every saturday, it is one of the more dark and disturbing Sci-fi movies for a more adult audience.<BR>The visual effects and the art direction is great, and it's a spooky vision of the future.
B00003CXA3|5.0|More than 30 years after its release, &quot;The French Connection&quot; has become one of the signpost cop dramas of American cinema.  That its portrayal of law enforcement officiers is far less than flattering is hardly the point.  The movie is stylish, brilliantly acted, authentically filmed, and features perhaps the most amazing chase sequence in movie history (the biggest reason why it is so amazing is explained in the extras that come with this DVD).<br />Having said all of that, the five-star DVD edition is an absolute must own for those who love the movie.  It contains a full disc of extras, including two documentaries, a bunch of deleted scenes, as well as other goodies.  If only every great movie was available in a package this complete.
B0001GL3KE|5.0|This is the best romantic comedy ever produced!  I saw this movie THREE times in the theatre and would go three more times!  Each time I saw it, I picked up something that I had missed previously.  Each story stands alone and will touch your heart, and make you feel good inside, but they are all very cleverly woven together as well.  This movie has everything - comedy, heartache, sorrow, love.  After seeing it, the message really hit home to me - Love IS actually all around, and if you love someone, take the risk and tell them!  This movie gets 10 stars from me!
630469797X|4.0|It was great timing to re-release the original &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; before the &quot;new&quot; version comes out in theaters.  Before purchasing this DVD, I hadn't seen the original in nearly 20 years.  &quot;DOTD&quot; is as disturbing as any horror film ever made.  It mixes black humor in horror in such a way that many other films have attempted to copy with little success.  The acting may be a bit stlited at times, and the storytelling might be a tad rough around the edges, but horror films don't get much more realistic (or brutal) than this.  It also appears (at least from the previews) that the new theatrical version is going to be a far different movie from this one.<br />The DVD, however, is a bit of disappointment in one repsect.  Other than commentary from Director George Romero, there isn't much in the way of special features.
B0001ADAVK|5.0|This is one of the best movie's I've ever seen.* When was it originally released-?- And where are it's Oscar's!!! It is an excellent movie*- the storyline itself, & the acting... Wow*! I think this is one of Julia Roberts best.* And all the other women in this film are fantastic also. Julia Stiles was great, and Maggie Gyllenhaal, another great job.* All 3 of these women should have gotten Oscar's for their fantastic work, along with the movie itself.* Kristen Dunst & Marcia Gay Harden also made this film something special & I do not want to dismiss their work when I say the other 3 women deserved Oscar's. They all made this film a fantastic piece. It was great to see ALL these talented women working together, & so well.*  <BR>The story is well written with basic truths. Take it from a woman who knows. It is NOT just about marriage also, as I've heard some say. They must have not really been listening to it. It's simply about \\"Women\\" - their lives- their feelings - their choices. No matter which life style we may choose for ourselves, we're all just human beings first. It's ok to be yourself- explore- be special & unique. A beautiful film all in all! A must see for women & the men that love them! (& for our young ladies also- this is inspiration at it's best!)<BR>This movie makes you think- asks questions- consider everything- & is entertaining while all that is going on. It's a movie to watch again & again!* <BR>Don't just read reviews of this one- create your own*- Watch it for yourself!*
B00005K3NY|4.0|This film is one of my personal new 'classics' of horror, although it's also a sci-fi film. The plot centers around a small group of 'mutants,' long before the 'X-Men' made them cool, who have the unique ability to scan the thought patterns of others, thus knowing what people are thinking. However, as always, not all mutants play nice, as actor, Michael Ironside, has a great role as the demented Revok, who likes to scan people's minds just a bit too long, leading one to lose one's head, as in the infamous exploding head scene! Revok leads his bands of rebel mutuants against the establishment, and only another Scanner with equal ability can stand in his way. Even though this film is dated somewhat and campy in parts, it's definitely entriguing and fans of gross-out effects will eat this film up!
B00006JKOL|2.0|Re: \\"controversy\\" below: Whether or not some sort of Minstrel in the Gallery \\"sheet music\\" folio was ever in print, one is not NOW; I checked this out. There are a couple of \\"greatest hits\\" compilations, and there is an Aqualung folio (available from this vender). That's all.<br />Why Aqualung? Oh, I think you know why. Aqualung, because despite certain hysterical, desperate protestations to the contrary, Aqualung remains Jethro Tull's most popular album; Aqualung is widely and generally considered to be be Jethro Tull's best album, to the extent that I think we can say with impunity simply that Aqualung IS Jethro Tull's best album. It was unfortunately all downhill from Aqualung, slowly downhill at first, but then with WarChild and Minstrel in the Gallery and Too Old to Rock and Roll rapidly, precipitately downhill. <br />I know better than ever to side with anti-intellectuals, but, sorry, I'm not going furnish any analysis myself. Basically I consider this beating a dead horse. I want to make a small aside instead. \\"Official\\" forces have been trumpeting this and WarChild as a field in which Jethro Tull orchestral-instrument arranger David Palmer could range unfettered (the then David Palmer, that is: having undergone a \\"sex-change\\" operation, he now calls himself Dee Palmer). I've always found on the contrary that his contributions were more telling in moderation: just one song on This Was, Mick Abraham's \\"Move On Alone\\", just one song on Stand Up, \\"Reason for Waiting\\", nothing on Benefit, just two songs on Aqualung, \\"Wond'ring Aloud\\" and \\"Slipstream\\", just a snippet on Thick as a Brick.
B0001611DI|5.0|Probably 'the' most copied, and in most cases badly, zombie film of all-time. George Romero's masterpiece is as much a social commentary as it is a horror film. Not to worry though, horror fans, plenty of gore in this one to satisfy even the most rabid of gore fans. The stunning Divimax transfer presents the clearest copy of 'Dawn' that I've ever seen. The sound is much improved, though in parts the dialogue is still low, but overall a huge improvement on former versions. In parts some scenes have been fully restored, because although I've seen this film many times, I caught myself noticing bits I hadn't seen before. For those few who have never seen this film, beware, remove impressionable children from the room. Tom Savini's gore effects are even more disturbing in this crystal-clear transfer. I venture to say the things that they got away with then, probably wouldn't pass censors today. A definite must own for horror enthusiasts, even if some aspects of it seem dated, filmed in the late 70's, it's still relevant today, and the effects hold up to today's horror standards. I say, order this version quickly before it vanishes!
0380789035|4.0|Shadow, the protagonist, is Everyman, or so he thinks. And no one else is what they immediately seem to be, although their names (Wednesday, Mr Nancy, Mr Jacquel &amp; Mr Ibiss) give them away to anyone raised on a steady diet of mythology and folklore as I was.  And what happens to those old gods when we make new ones?  I almost expected a comic strip god to show up -superman, spiderman, batman, maybe even tinkerbell - since we have given those creations many of the attributes and expectations our ancestors had for their creations of Jove, Thor, Vishnu, or Isis. And like Tinkerbell, it is our belief that keeps them alive and powerful.<br />Neil Gaiman is one of the finest modern fantasy writers. He holds to the conventions of the genre without being derivative.  American Gods was one I enjoyed, passed on to my son, who read it in a weekend, and who has recommended to his friends, all of whom play fantasy games on their computers.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|After hearing Howard Shore's stunning conclusion to Perter Jackson's epic Lord of the Rings trilogy, I can only state one thing: Excellent. Excellent doesn't really do justice to the magnificence of Shore's work. Like another classic trilogy score (Williams from Return of the Jedi), Shore presents a much more mature version of work. All our favorite themes are there: The Fellowship theme has now evolved into a wistful yet powerful fanfare for Aragorn. The Shire theme makes a return as does the Hobbit theme, both played magnificently by James Galway. Also returning is the Mordor theme, it's menacing notes now grown into a malevolent force. The Rohan theme also makes a brief reappearance, while the elvish theme comes to a full circle, representing Aragorn as he gets his sword in the track Andruil. The beginning of the cd is much more playful than that of the Two Towers, but it swiftly transforms into a majestic fanfare for Minas Tirith and Gondor which is among the greatest moments on the cd. Once again Enya does not sing on this cd, but in a suprisingly powerful decision, Billy Boyd aka Pippin does appear, singing briefly for Lord Denethor, capturing the rift between the Steward and Faramir. In track 17, The Return of the King, Shore takes a listener on a journey of all his developed themes for our heroes. Absent from this cd is Sauruman's theme, the reason being because he is defeated in the Two Towers. Also absent is the treeish theme for the Ents and Treebeard, but the absence of these themes is not at all detrimental to the cd. As for Oscar-winning the song at the end by Annie Lennox, it is a vast improvement over Gollum's song, and captures triumph and tragedy of the conclusion of the Lord of the Rings.
0684800713|5.0|This is one of the all-time great novels, along with The Catcher in the Rye, Women, The Great Gatsby, American Psycho and False Rhymes. The writing is crisp, the pages look great, it's really where modern American writing began.
0060090367|4.0|Like Marian Keyes' other books, &quot;Watermelon,&quot; her first, is warm, witty in the extreme, funny, and somehow wise, all at the same time.<br />The book begins on a horrifying happenstance: Claire has just given birth to a beautiful, healthy daughter, and as she lies basking in the afterglow, her slime of a husband, James, enters her hospital room to tell her that: 1) he is in love with another woman; and that 2) he is therefore leaving Claire. Just like that. No muss, no fuss. With a beginning like that, it's hard to imagine where to go from here, but Keyes manages to pick Claire up by the scruff of her neck, shake her off, and move her and her newborn back to Dublin from London, where she had been living with James.<br />Once in Dublin, Claire runs the gamut of emotions, from not showering for a week to crying nonstop for 24 hours to yelling and screaming to becoming the &quot;antichrist&quot; to her large, extended and very strange family. Yet we love her more on every page. And we want so much for Claire to &quot;sort herself out,&quot; as the Brits say.<br />Will Claire sort herself out? Will James come back and grovel? If he does, will Claire take him back? Will her parents ever break free of their strange and abominable daughters? It's all answered in the book, in prose that is so completely fresh and witty, so very funny, that the reader almost forgets that there is actually a real story here, and a good one at that.<br />It's nice to know that Keyes only got better with time, because this, her first novel, is just about perfect, and I'm glad to know that it wasn't a flash in the pan!
B000009EUM|5.0|This is my favourite A-Ha CD, much better than the first and not as dark as the later ones; don't understand me wrong, I have all A-Ha CD's and I love them all except&quot; Memorial Beach&quot;, but for me this is the best, with timeless and unique songs as &quot;The Weight of the Wind&quot; and &quot;Scoundrel Days&quot;.<BR>Until recently, I could never listen to it as I only had it on vinyl but now that I bought the Cd on Amazon, it gives me great pleasure being able to listen to it again, partly out of nostalgia of course, but also because all songs stood the test of time so well. Excellent!
6303402348|2.0|This movie is like a spoiled child: everyone involved gave it everything it could ever possibly need or want, and yet still it ends up annoying you enough for you to want to put a pillow over it's face and blame it on cot death.<br />seriously, there is stuff to like in this film. Tom Hanks and Gary Sinise both give good performances(Sinise especially for acting like a Nam weathered loon), the effects are cool, though oddly out of place in a sentimental comedy drama like this, and it does have that hollywood blockbuster polish that is so attractive to us cinematic crows.<br />but something dark lies beneath, and this is the way they have purposely placed a right wing cowardly subtext throughout the entire movie, which delivers a message to all viewers which is just WRONG WRONG WRONG. Witness: Forrest solves his problems, and those of a thousand other people, by RUNNING AWAY VERY QUICKLY. <BR>he becomes a good soldier by TELLING THE SARGEANT WHAT HE WANTS TO HEAR.<BR>in the entire movie, ONLY THE HIPPIE GETS AIDS and finally<BR>BY BEING INCESSANTLY HAPPY ABOUT EVERY DETAIL OF HIS EXISTENCE,EVERYTHING TURNS OUT ALRIGHT. this is all so unbelievably terrible and bad it serves only to make me hate the Oscars for giving not giving it to Pulp Fiction, which is an infinitely better movie.<br />PS my friend and fellow Horseman El Satanico is right, a man who spends all day at a bus stop telling people unbelievable stories has to be pretty sauced.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|Visualize Tokyo. Got it? Now add popular favorite Bill Murray, doing his &quot;lovable shmoe&quot; shtick. Toss in American Rhapsody's up-and-comer Scarlett Johansson, doing her standard &quot;like, duh&quot; face. Dip them both into emotional torpor in the sleek Park Hyatt, add local color, stir. Et voilà: Lost in Translation. <BR>For Sofia Coppola, this must have been the easiest pitch in the world -- which is perhaps helpful when pitching to Daddy. The youngish director and heiress to American cinema did things her way a few years ago with her ambitious adaptation of Jeffrey Eugenides' novel The Virgin Suicides, crafting a truly poignant slab of Middle American art with A-list Hollywood talent. This time around, though, her effort feels as pedestrian and confused as its subjects. She hasn't delivered a turkey -- it's a cute little movie, if not as rich as her brother Roman's similarly themed CQ -- but when work this potentially satisfying remains flatly obvious, it's almost worse than being flat-out bad. <br />We begin with a close-up of an ass, and it's tempting to suggest that the remainder of the film is simply a product thereof, but the project's kindly nature doesn't call for that kind of harshness. Rather, the tone is more distinctly bumming. The peach-panty-clad glutes belong to dewy depressed Charlotte (Johansson), who's loitering at the Hyatt in hopes that her busy photojournalist husband, John (Giovanni Ribisi), will take five to comfort her. No such luck, but Charlotte does find a surrogate friend in Bob Harris (Murray), an American movie star and cultural castaway who's in town for the noble task of plugging whiskey. <br />Perhaps it cuts just a little too close to home when Charlotte bemoans: &quot;I just don't know what I want to be. I tried being a writer, but I hate what I write. I tried to be a photographer, but I don't take good pictures.&quot; Well, that's OK, but if she's the director's mouthpiece, we've got a problem. This is further complicated by Lost in Translation's being another feature shot on 35mm film with an A-list cast. An amateur with a DV camera would be more welcome under these circumstances, or even the director herself just wandering with her friends across the street from her father's San Francisco offices into Chinatown. But a well-heeled princess with a professional crew struggling to prove her funky street cred ends up feeling lost indeed.

0385504209|2.0|I was disapointed it this book, but not for the reasons most people are writing about.  I enjoyed the alternate history of the gospels and the secret workings inside the catholic church.  For those who find this kind of conspiracy theory unrealistic, the non-fiction biblical histories are just a few clicks away, why are you reading a fiction book?  What ultimately disappointed me about the DaVinci Code was the poor character development.  I understand that Dan Brown wants to reuse his main character in a series, but this &quot;James Bond of the Art World&quot; character really become a bore to read about.  He was not risky, charasmatic, or even charming.  Brown showed no creativity to get his main characters out of tight spots and basically had them running around the street paris saying &quot;oh my, they are after me! what do I do?&quot;  I would rather have read more about the villians thoughts, at least they showed some originality.  I was very unimpressed and disappointed that a book that has been read by so many people could be written so poorly.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Back before firefly came on FOX was letting dark angel continue to season 3 but then canceled for this show! So I vowed not to watch it!  Then when it came on I of course watched it =\<P>And im glad I did!<P>I watched the show in Widescreen with their Dolby surround and the special effects scenes were as amazing then as they are now on the DVDs!  Fox has a way of doing some series DVDs such as Roswell king of the hill and some others in the type of packaging they did with this set and I like it however I wish their was a book or something!<P>If you're unfamiliar with this show it is basically a great sci-fi / western show with a great cast.  This show had the ability to go on for several seasons (with such a cast of members the character development alone continue into many many seasons!)  However fox as they tend to do mess things up for firefly.<P>They aired the shows out of order and never let it really get the attention that it needed.  Needless to say 2003 was a great year for fox TV.  You had Firefly John Doe and Fast Lane (and of course 24) and typical fox fashion they canceled them all!  Im hoping that fox brings John Doe to DVD it is a highly original series.  Now I pretty much avoid fox shows because they get canceled and I don't want to get attached to the characters only to have them gone the next season.<P>Firefly even though it is canceled it has a great story and this DVD will entertain you a lot.  If you tried to watch the show when it was just on FOX and you didn't quite understand most of it (they did show the pilot for the series almost at the end right before they canceled it) and several intermediary episodes were never aired.  This DVD set brings all the episodes together in a logical manner (they way joss whedon ment them to be) and in an amazing transfer.<P>Technical details.  The transfer is amazingly clear widescreen and it shows that they used nice cameras for this set and the audio is simply amazing! Could use some more extras but if youthink about it you get several unaired episodes as extras!<P>Bottom line if you enjoy good sci-fi or some anime (cowboy bebop is a good sci-fi western) or just highly original stories this is a good series to watch that will leave you wanting more!

If the packaging was any worse, I may not have bought the dvd, which would have been a shame since I have been looking forward to owning this movie on dvd...
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Sofia Coppola has written one of the best screenplays in the last 15 years.  Lost in Translation captures the purest essence of romance.  It the feeling of leading up to that first kiss when love is at it's purest form.<br />Bill Murray keeps demonstrating that he is one of the most versatile and talented actors of our time.  His dry wit matches perfectly in this melancholy film about a man drifting in a sea of loneliness.  <br />Scarlett Johannsen plays a young neglected wife who crosses the path of Murray several times in a Tokyo hotel.  Together, they share in each other's quiet despair while denying that there are romantic feelings brewing.<br />This is a beatiful story of star-crossed lovers with an ending that will keep you guessing.  A must see!

B00005JMCN|3.0|...i suppose his name would be Seabiscuit.  I think the thing that makes this movie work is that it is based on a true story.  It's a feel-good movie that really has some shining moments.  <br />Honestly, I have little interest in horse-racing and that's why I don't think much of this film.  Tobey Maguire is fine but the movie is a little forgettable, in my opinion.
B00005JKN9|5.0|Inspired by Martin Scorsese's lifelong fascination with the obscure early history of his city, Gangs of New York is an epic tale of gang warfare set in the \\"Five Points\\" slums of mid-1800's New York City. It stars Leonardo Di Caprio as orphaned street urchin Amsterdam Vallon, son of the legendary Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson), an Irish immigrant gang leader killed in the opening battle by Bill \\"The Butcher\\" Cutting (Daniel Day Lewis), leader of a powerful, anti-immigrant gang. The film follows Amsterdam's quest to avenge his father's death, in the process taking a fascinating glimpse into what New York probably resembled at the time- in all its filth, squalor and violence.<br />...the acting performances are inspired and gripping. Englishman Daniel Day Lewis, having perfected his Irish brogue with his Oscar-winning performance in In the Name of the Father, makes a successful switch to what's almost a modern New York cabbie accent. It is unknown whether this accurately reflects the \\"true\\" New York accent of the early and mid- 1800's, however, as the main inspiration for representative speech tones was a recording from a much later date (1892) by the poet Walt Whitman.<br />Despite her flaming hair, Diaz is less successful as Irish trollop Jennie. Traces of her modern American accent occasionally creep through (though she does carry out the role of immigrant harlot with gusto). While Di Caprio is fairly believable as the son of slain Irish gang leader Priest Vallon, the short time frame of the film invites ambivalence to his part. The film expects boyishness- Leonardo's signature characteristic- from a quite young would-be supplanter, while simultaneously requires a toughness Di Caprio seems to lack (not helped by his omnipresent floppy conductor's cap). Ultimately, was this a role for Leonardo Di Caprio or for Brad Pitt?<br />Perhaps this ambivalence owes to the length of the film- much longer than your usual Hollywood movie, clocking in at 2 hours and 40 minutes. Thefilm could easily have been shorter while still delivering on the same basic plot; some reviewers have wished this were the case. However, it could also have been longer. One wishes to have seen more of Amsterdam's ill-fated, almost sanctified father, the fundamental source of the Butcher's mythic, all-consuming fear, and of course the driving force for Amsterdam's quest.<br />...However, the film does seem to contain some more compelling points for serious reflection today. First of all, the depth of racism and anti-Union fervor, even in the heart of the North, dispels the myth of Yankee righteousness and resolve. Secondly, the apparent feeling of New Yorkers that they were both above the law is remarkable and unimaginable in today's America. In the film's span of 15 years, however, we witness a transformation from a primitive, neglected and somewhat wild city that was left to its own laws to the uncompromising control of the federal government- displayed by the US Army's mowing down of its own citizens in the final scene (the Draft Riot). <br />Read the complete version of this review, and many others- at Balkanalysis.com
B000003TA4|1.0|Does a self-inflicted hole in the head make one a better musician? I thought not, so let's drop the charade that Kurt Cobain is a legend. If Nirvana and Kurt Cobain were the be-all, end-all of the music scene, it wouldn't have continued to evolve much less thrive after Cobain took the cowardly way out of life ten years ago. This proves that Cobain was unimportant to the music world. Look for yourself and try to find any contribution he brought to music. When you see it in its totality, his mark on the rock music scene was minimal, and his mark the music scene as a whole was detrimental. Most music in general is stagnant because it continues to include Kurt Cobain as an essential influence, but rock is regressing because Cobain is the man who allowed Nu-Metal and Hate-Rock to be bore from Nirvana. Nirvana had none of the passion, drive, and true grit that makes honest musicians stand out. Nirvana fans confuse laziness and sloppy musicianship with pure honesty just because Kurt says that's what it is. That's how easily-duped they are. When I see Kurt Cobain compared alongside Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan, and John Lennon, I find it sickening because Cobain, as he's been anointed by his fans and critics alike, is King of the Slackers. He was a lazy opportunist who fed off his legend status to finance his &quot;heroine&quot; habit. A modern musician and artist I've stumbled upon recently is Tracey Chapman. Unlike Cobain, she truly could lend her voice for the persecuted because she herself has been persecuted. She spoke of all the desolation Kurt Cobain never faced but claimed he had. She spoke of inciting a revolution for the poor to rise and gain what they had been denied; Kurt Cobain just wanted to incite a revolution for spoiled middle-class kids from divorced parents to gain what they never were entitled to. Tracey's wails could both move people to tears and prove injustices of the downtrodden all at once. Could Kurt Cobain HONESTY do any of those things? No. <br />Whengetting into music, I suggest anything besides whiny nasal bands, Nirvana, pop-punk, and any form of Metal, especially for younger people getting into the music scene. If you read that and ask, what else is there to choose from, I think the you've given in to the media already. Once teens discover Kurt Cobain, they think that just because the media and stuffy critics say so, that there's nothing beyond him, which is a lie. I saw bypass him and Nirvana altogether.<br />I recommend: Tracey Chapman, The Cranberries, The B-52s, The Beatles, John Lennon, Bob Dylan, The Moody Blues, and anything else experimental or strange. Nirvana was just lazy.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I got this CD as a gift.The first listen wasn't valuable.The second listen was better.Then I listened to it more.The more I listened to it the more I became addicted.<BR>My favorite song was &quot;Infatuation.&quot;It is very catchy.It explains about her first love(Or at least I think it does).It is 4 minutes and 17 seconds.It has an interlude that goes with it.The interlude is &quot;Primer Amor.&quot;It is in spanish.It is 53 seconds.<BR>This album has many diferent genres.I'm glad Christina took the time to do something creative.She wrote most of the songs.The only songs she didn't write were &quot;Beautiful&quot; and &quot;Impossible.&quot;<BR>So go get this album.
B0000029DD|5.0|Jeff Buckley released but one fully realized album during his all-too-brief stay with us on earth, but that album is one of the most passionate and spiritual albums I have ever heard. Imagine a fiery young singer/songwriter who is influenced by the likes of Led Zeppelin and The Smiths. Oh, and this dude has the most amazing voice ever. Also imagine his band (bassist Mick Grondhal, drummer Matt Johnson, guitarist Michael Tighe) knew his playing inside and out and acted more like a backing band for John Coltrane or Miles Davis than a traditional rock ensemble. Then you have a rough idea of the amazing album known simply as _Grace_.<br />  _Grace_ beings with the beautiful &quot;Mojo Pin,&quot; fading into a soft guitar line along with Buckley's gentle crooning. With Zeppelin-esque intensity the track grows stronger and louder to it's climax. The wonderful guitar work ties the song together while Matt Johnson's drumming accentuates each change of pace. &quot;The welts of your scorn, my love, give me more/Send whips of opinion down my back, give me more&quot; Buckley's singing builds, &quot;Well it's you I've waited my life to see/It's you I've searched so hard for,&quot; soaring into the ether with the last phrase. This flows into the next track, &quot;Grace&quot;, which serves as a beautifully fiery compliment to the atmospheric &quot;Mojo Pin.&quot; The climax found within is glorious, with sweet guitar strumming and then Buckley belting out with incredible emotion: &quot;And I feel them drown my name/So easy to know/And forget with this kiss/I'm not afraid to go&quot; His voice now more intense than ever, nearly screaming &quot;But it goes so slow&quot;. He holds the last note for what seems like an eternity.<br />  The Gospel flavored &quot;Lover, You Should've Come Over&quot; moves from a harmonium opening to a solemn acoustic guitar backdrop grounded by Grondahl's tasteful bass playing. Over the sweet Hammond organ and the R&amp;B styled backing vocals, Buckley builds the song to a desperate crescendo: &quot;It's never over/My kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder/It's never over/All my riches for her smiles when I slept so soft against her,&quot; his own fine guitar work adding to the beauty of the lyrics, &quot;It's not too late.&quot;<br /><br />  The highlight of the album comes with Buckley's emotionally-jarring rendition of Leonard Cohen's &quot;Hallelujah&quot;.  It is as if Cohen wrote the song specifically with Buckley's voice and style in mind. As tender as the heart that broke to write this song, just Buckley and a guitar, he confesses to us: &quot;Well maybe there's a God above/But all I've ever learned from love/Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you.&quot; The song is impossibly gorgeous - easily one of my all-time favorite songs. A minimal stripped back performance but with such a spiritual, devotional vocal. It has been known to draw tears to the eyes of lumberjacks.<br /><br />  _Grace_ has this incredibly spiritual, romantic feel to it that I can't describe. Buckley's extreme intensity and emotional sincerity make _Grace_ what it is - a flourishing achievement in every conceivable way.kley builds the song to a desperate crescendo: &quot;It's never over/My kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder/It's never over/All my riches for her smiles when I slept so soft against her,&quot; his own fine guitar work adding to the beauty of the lyrics, &quot;It's not too late.&quot;<BR> <BR>     The highlight of the album comes with Buckley's emotionally-jarring rendition of Leonard Cohen's &quot;Hallelujah&quot;.

B00018D44U|2.0|. . . &quot;The rest wafts discreetly around the room like something manufactured by Airwick. Don't Know Why, the best-known track from Come Away With Me, had an undeniable melody: you might not have liked it, but it was impossible to dislodge from your head. There's nothing similar here. In fact, Feels Like Home is so inoffensive you have trouble remembering whether you put it on.&quot;<br />&quot;You suspect that this is the appeal for the millions of people who buy this kind of thing. They are past the point of wanting to be moved or inspired by rock and pop. Instead they treat music as something ornamental, something with which you can tastefully decorate your home. Beautifully produced and beautifully played to no cumulative effect whatsoever, this album fits the bill perfectly.&quot;<br />-Alexis Petridis<BR>Friday February 6, 2004<BR>The Guardian
B00012QM8G|2.0|After a recent visit to the Holocaust museum in DC, I felt the desire to explore what happened further. Schindler's List, the supposed pinnacle of Holocaust cinematic representation, seemed like the natural continuation of that curiosity. After viewing this film, however, I don't feel better-informed about the Holocaust nor particularly moved. <br />I believe the former complaint can be attributed to a confusing narrative that frequently flipflops location and focus, and a generally insular historical viewpoint. I'm hardly a historian and care little to point out factual inaccuracies. But for a film that takes place in the heart of Europe during World War II, there is no talk of the war or the politics surrounding it. For a film that deals specifically with the Holocaust, there's only one Nazi main character.  Needless to say, Schindler's List does not seek to educate.  Movies are rarely historically insightful, and I consider this more of a subjective disapppointment of my own historical curiosity than a weakness of the film.  <br />I believe the latter problem- that is, that this film is inept cinematically- can be attributed to Steven Spielberg's sentimentality and banality as a director.  He's had a wildly lucrative and sometimes brilliant career, but here he is visually and stylistically uncertain.  In going about depicting one of the 20th century's most vile, cruel events, he neither strives for unsparing objective realism nor does he develop a particular insight. The reoccurring images of huddles of Jews grimly awaiting death are simplistic descriptions- not stirring cinema- and thus convey as much emotion as contained in the Holocaust context, which- lucky for Spielberg- is plenty enough to chill in a superficial way.  It doesn't resonate though.  <br />When the action moves from Plaszlow death camp to Auschwitz, there appears a glimmer of hope that Spielberg actually might be grasping the suffocatingly heinous panic of the Holocaust. As such, there is an initially very evocative scene where a group of women are herded into gas chambers. Gripping suspense and a true revulsion mounts as you wait for the gas to filter in... But he betrays his own moment when, miraculously, the showers turn on, revealing a genuine shower room, and the women rejoice while bathing themselves. The way that unrealistically happy ending simultaneously subverts such a precious, harrowing emotional moment and trivializes the true terror of these camps is contemptible. <br />Spielberg's ineptitude is particulary distracting in that all of the prisoners with personality or detail survive, and no attention and dexterity is given to those individuals who don't. And no in my opinion, a red-garmented girl in a black and white movie, while symbolic of individuality, is not effective in conveying the individuality of the victims.  The horror of the Holocaust is not just that these people were innocent, but that they were human beings, with lives, lovers, friends, family, hopes, fears, psychology of their own. Without personalities, Spielberg's faceless nondescript victims obscure this grim reality of genocide. <br />The narrative- to varying degrees- follows humanitarian Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), his Jewish accountant, Isaac Stern (Ben Kingsley), Nazi psycho Amon Goethe (Ralph Fiennes), and Jewish maid Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz)- all of whom played a role in the factory employment of endangered Jews that saved 1,300 lives.  Liam Neeson as Schindler is as fabulous as his character, and saves even his terrifically overwrought final monologue. His dignity and focus easily could have subsided to Spielberg and writer Steven Zallian's pompous heroism, but he keeps Schindler grounded in his realistically sleazy humanity.  Perhaps an even better character in the film is Ben Kingsley's Isaac Stern mainly because he possesses that quality foreign to Spielberg: ambiguity. Unlike the majority of the film's characters, he isn't saintly, subservient, or evil.He's a bit surly and he has dignity and he's not afraid to tell Oskar Schindler to screw off. The rapport (or lackthereof) between Schindler and Stern- the two most ambiguous characters- gives the film's first half considerable juice and drive. <br />However, midway through, S.S. Officer, Amon Goethe (Ralph Fiennes) is introduced and a more banal image of evil cannot be found in cinema, except, perhaps in the action blockbuster genre. Supposedly Spielberg cast Fiennes because of his \\"evil sexuality\\" but here, Fiennes is fat and unkempt, an unattractive slob who pees like Homer Simpson after shooting Jews for target practice, which Spielberg inexplicably shows in a deliberately comic context. If Schindler's List was on its way to being a flawed but still amazing and good-intentioned film, Goethe's cardboard presence coupled with Fiennes' vapid performance ruins its potential to be anything more than sorely misguided. <br />When Goethe objectifies the Jewish housekeeper, Helen (Embeth Davidtz) Spielberg crassly films the whole scene with Davidtz's Helen braless in a dripping wet shirt, as if evoking the titillation of Goethe- when really we should be focusing on the conflict in Goethe's tormented lust for Helen and his hatred for her Jewishness. Alas, Spielberg can't decide if this is a wet t-shirt contest or a psychologically insightful moment.<br />These individual moments add up- and up and up and up- to a sub-par film experience.  I do not in any way denigrate those who are touched and moved by this film. The mere fact that it has reached so many people about an important event (however superficially/ineptly it deals with that event) is commendable. But at the same time, I think our standards need to evolve, and Schindler's List is too flawed and obvious to be deemed 'masterpiece'- status.
B000066F6H|4.0|i find out about this band a while ago, but when i got rid of kazaa i forgot about them till recently, when i got the cd.  its a good cd, but i overplayed it. dont make the same mistake.  definitely a worthwile buy.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Finally, a hip hop artist has come out with an album worth listening to.  From start to finish, this is one of the best albums that I have heard in a very long time.  Kanye comes with his own uniques style and he does not jump on the bandwagon with his other label mates and rap about sex, diamonds, and money.  He comes correct with the beats and his lyrics are out of this world.  This is one of those albums that you can play from start to finish without skipping anything.  I appreciate his artistic ablility and it is my prediction that Kanye will be around for a very long time.  Just for the record, I think that my favorite song on the album is Jesus Walks...(listen to lyrics.)  If you been thinking about buying this CD...think no more...get it, get it, get it...you won't regret it.
B000089RVX|5.0|I actually bought this CD on a whim right after it first came out - BEST whim I've ever had!!  The music is moving and touching, fits ANY mood you could possibly be in, and so much more!  There are times when it has been the ONLY CD I've listened to for weeks at a time in my car and I never have, and never will, get tired of hearing this CD!<br />Absolutely moving and brilliant...
B00005JMX4|1.0|...this movie is really awful. Don't watch it. People who give it a 5/5 rate must be paid for it by the director. Sorry, the acting and the plot are simply bad.
B00008H2LB|4.0|Alright, I love LP and I always have since they came out. This CD is nowhere near what Hybrid Theory is, but it's better in one aspect. They showed that they will do what they want to do with their music, not what others want them to do. I respect them for this. The rap/rock thing might be dying out, but they are gonna be along for the whole ride because they won't change for anyone. This cd is very good, there's just some things missing. I was expecting something a little harder and edgier, but they went a different route. They slowed down a bit. That's cool because they pull it off pretty well. I think Chester has went through a lot of sh*t these last three years and it shows through in his lyrics for this album. I like a band that has words where you can really feel what the singer has gone through. All in all, these guys are great and they make good albums and they will continue to do just that. My prediction is that the next Linkin Park cd will just blow the f-ing roof off the place. That's just my opinion though. Buy this cd because it is a good effort, it's just not Hybrid Theory. Oh yeah! You have to go see them live because they kick so much A$$! They are better live than they are on cd. Also, pick up the live in Texas cd cuz it rocks and shows you how good they are when they play live. Give them a chance and buy this cd. If you liked Hybrid Theory, I think there is no way you will dislike this album. Thanx.
0786868694|2.0|I am a fan of Lawson's cookbooks, shows, etc..., however, this book is really perplexing to me.  The recipes are tasty, if you can get past the weird photography.  I mean, some of the photos are downright disgusting and not delicious looking in the least.  For example, the ham in coca cola looks like well, something you'd find in the dumpster at the Honeybaked store.  And it's a ham for chrissakes!  Hams love the camera!  This is the ugliest picture of a ham. Ever.  Blech.  The lamb with pomegranate is particularly distracting, as are the lentils with sausages.<br />I don't know if the photographer has an eating disorder or what, but the photos are nasty.  Someone on that staff has a weird relationship with food. And let's face it, half the reason you buy a cookbook is for the beautiful, airbrushed photos of dishes that will never look that way when you make them for yourself.  But it's nice to know it's possible.<br />This is a book to get out of the library and photocopy the recipes you want. Sans photos.
B000066NW0|1.0|13 tracks of mind-stimulating music. Avril has brought to us a masterpiece which gives a boost to our minds and spirits. How much of a musical genius would Mozart have become if, when in the womb, he heard the soft strains of 'Sk8r Boi' drifting into his embryonic ears? Perhaps he would have become an actual musician like Avril instead of writing this symphonic crap. I mean, Avril can't really play the electric guitar, but Mozart probably couldn't play it at all! What the hell was wrong with him? I wonder what life would be like if Mozart were a 'Sk8r Punk' like my hero and idol, Avil Lavigne. He had to wear a powdered wig! Dear God. Why didn't he 'braid' his hair 'in a zillion braids' like Avril? Few musicians are as talented or as sexy as sk8r punk Avril. Nothing this thought-provoking has been around in the Foul Forties, the Festering Fifties, the Sucky Sixties, the Slummy Seventies, or the Evil Eighties. But when the Nifty Nineties rolled around, Avril's red-and-white Canadian colors (so very punk) began to shine. God bless Avril.<br />Just kidding. Go to hell, Avril.<br />-MLH
B000005HN6|5.0|I'll keep this short.<br />If you are one of the many Opeth fans who fell in love with Blackwater Park or Damnation and are looking to get into earlier Opeth, steer clear of this release. This album is a mixture of doom metal, folk passages, classical technique, and cold production. Akerfeldt's growls are terribly raspy and high-pitched, the singing is almost nonexistent, out of tune and soft, and the lyrics are overly ambiguous. The music seems to start and stop, with random passages being glued together to form songs with no real rhyme or reason behind them. A different bassist and drummer were present here as well, so breathy, open bass lines and midtempo, triggered double bass drums appear instead of the subdued natural styles of current players Mendez and Lopez. You have been warned.<br />However, this album also contains many gorgeous passages in a style that would only return for the next two albums. A certain poignancy is present is was traded in for depression and art-rock. Under A Weeping Moon? The Apostle In Triumph? Wow. That's some evocative imagery there. And the occasional Opethian Gothenburg riff does appear, such as in the first few minutes of &quot;Forest Of October&quot; or &quot;The Twilight Is My Robe.&quot;<br />Also included is a 3-minute piano instrumental performed by the band's drummer, and a short acoustic piece. Little known fact: Part of &quot;Requiem&quot; is actually present on the seventh track as an intro to &quot;The Apostle In Triumph&quot; due to a tracksetting mess-up.<br />Orchid is Opeth in the beginning, before the recognition, before the masterpieces that were to come. And it's still amazing.<br />Recommended for experienced Opeth fans, and those that like My Dying Bride, Extol, Agalloch, and early Ulver.
6300214028|5.0|Of the wide-release, narrative, political films made in the second half of the 20th century, surely \\"Reds\\" ranks as one of the best.  \\"The Manchurian Candidate,\\" \\"All the President's Men,\\" \\"The Candidate,\\" and \\"Sweet Bird of Youth\\" are all interesting mixtures of fact and fiction that actually pale next to Beatty's gutsy work.  Even Oliver Stone's work on historical situations and figures, \\"Platoon,\\" \\"Salvador,\\" \\"JFK,\\" and \\"Nixon,\\" seems--as fine as it is--too slick and slightly impersonal compared to the political vigor and sexual dynamics explored in this bio-pic of Jack Reed, Eugene O'Neill and Louise Bryant.  The depths of feeling and intelligence in this film, despite your feelings about Communism, can make you glad to be alive.  Thank you, Warren Beatty, for giving this story to the world in such a powerful and even-handed way.  I can't wait until this movie is available on DVD.  Hopefully, Warren will add a commentary track or two w/Jack and Diane, of course.
B000002N25|5.0|Simply put, with albums like this, there is no need to listen to bad music.  Anyone who appreciates Dire Straits and/or any of Mark Knopfler's other solo albums (excellent also) will quite likely enjoy this one.  'Golden Heart' is quite likely the most beautiful song I have ever heard.  Definitely worth checking out.
B0001ADB8C|5.0|I would like to express my gratitude and feelings towards this Gentle Soul, the likes of which I've admired and idolized since I was a child. Like the millions of us who have loved the Beatles All these Years Ago, George Harrison holds a deep and special place in our hearts. For some unknown reason his solo career, has been overshadowed because of the magnitude of greatness that The Beatles have produced. This Box Set with it's re-mastered and enhanced sound is truly his signature and collective work of stunning beauty and genius.                  So much of what we have read about George Harrison is based on watered down versions of truth or pure guess work. If you really want to hear and feel the honesty and artistry of this underrated giant, and to get to the soul of this gifted man, then listen to this collection. Fortunatly There are  so many and numerous magical moments in this set, I am not at this time, going to be able to go into detail about them all. So I'd prefer to express myself by saying the following;     Our lives have been enriched because of this Dear One. We now have an opportunity to listen with a clarity and meditative quality unheard of until this set was released. In this box set is a treasury of melody, poetry, musicianship and spirituality performed for us all from a very unique and Loving Man. We are  better people for his oh so short stay on this planet. Listen to his music over and over again and reap the rewards of joy and happiness that this master has shared with us all. With Love and Gratitude Dear George, thank you !!  Docchalk

B00018D44U|5.0|The buzz surrounding Norah Jones isn't just a passing trend.  In fact, Miss Jones transcends any definition of 'trendiness' or 'passing fad.'  &quot;Feels Like Home&quot; is a departure from &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; with lyrics delving deeper into the roots of blues and vocals exuding a soulfulness only a true rhythem and blues singer can possess.<br />Songs like &quot;Sunrise&quot; and &quot;Creepin' In&quot; have a more upbeat attitude, while others like &quot;Humble Me&quot; wind down in a sorrowful apology to a former lover.<br />If you enjoy blues veterans like Tracy Chapman and Patsy Cline, Norah's latest is definitely one to take a gander at.
0671027387|4.0|With all the political fiascos going on in Washington DC, though this book skirts the edge of reality a bit too much for my taste, I have to admit maybe Brown is not too far off. What is really scary is Brown states that all the technology talked about in the book are available and being used. By WHOM? That's what has me worried. The technology reads like something out of Jules Verne, and the public doesn't know about it? That is extremely frightening to me.<br />This is a fast-paced read and an intelligent one. I thoroughly enjoyed it. A woman becomes involved through no fault of her own in a very complicated quest to make NASA a hit with the country again (this was prior to the last shuttle demise so the management idiocy still stands true at NASA), by putting a stone that is made to look like a meteorite in the frozen ice cap of the North. This meteorite has in it unrecognizable species of bugs that are fossilized. This attempt to make NASA looks good and retain the government's hold on NASA, start backfiring immediately when the scientists involved start noticing inconsistencies.<br />From there on it is a deadly shootout between the bad guys (overreaching government employees...sound familiar?) and people who are just trying to do what's right. If things ever get this bad, we are in big trouble!<br />Karen Sadler
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This CD is perhaps one of Britney's best album. Although she has only accomplished four albums, this pop princess is creating multi-platinum albums left and right. She definitely has a new sound and style, which is evident from the first track to the last. I can easily see most of the songs on this album on Britney's greatest hits (given that she creates one). This CD would make a great gift and has sold millions of copies already, so if you don't have a copy yourself go out and buy one. I think most people will find the money spent is worth it and will be satisfied, whether a devoted fan or not.
B0000024YL|5.0|Ahh, the sixties and the seventies when having a good voice was still considered important! These two blend their voices and their musical talents in this essential album. This CD actually does have the best of their music. I love the symphonic version of Bridge Over Troubled Water. The only one that makes me cringe a bit is 'Feeling Groovy'. It was a term of that time period, and I shouldn't feel embarrassed by it. That song is a sweet, short, and very positive song...I still listen to it.<br />I have nothing against any type of music. It just seems as I get older, there are less and less good singers, and good lyricists. Nothing stays for long. It's sad that many of us go back to classic rock, and my kids even do (especially my son who is in radio). There are a few very good singers among the women like Beyonce' and Sarah MacClahan (hope I spelled that right). But the guys? Nothing to write home about.<br />When musicians have to depend upon risque tactics as pulled by BOTH Justin Timberlake and Janet Jackson (who I use to like...NO MORE) rather than just show their singing abilities and talents, then something is wrong in the music industry. The obssession with death and sex...we thought the 60's was 'happening'. I remember my dad being bugged by rock music and so I watch myself, and try not to judge. <br />But I go out and buy this type of music (and I just bought another one). Music that you can sing or hum to, music that has something to say, music that I don't need to turn off when my 5 year granddaughter gets in the car. And she sings to it too. I saw someplace that Simon and Garfunkel might get together again. That would be a concert I'd love to go to...<br />Karen Sadler
B00005JMGC|4.0|This film intrigues me because some say, it talks more on feminism and the mind-opening to understanding women and the inner power they possessed within. Im not really into a feministic side but when I watched my film, I tried to be in neutral position to understand the perspective of this film. Yes, the girls were charming but im not really looking or admiring their looks but how they cope up the issues that women themselves facing because each of them, as the movie goes on and what it tells, each students were facing decisions either professionally or in romance. I really like each girls' attitude especially of Kirsten Dunst, who appeared to be domineering, Julia Styles who's sweet but very professional although weakness came over to her to choose marriage or to be a law student, Maggie Gyllenhall (is my spelling right?) who's liberated, open-minded but her love affairs were not that serious. Of course, Julia Roberts who really gave a different performance as a teacher who is determined to risk everything in order to address and unlock the inner power that each women can have by going 'beyond the imagery of the paintings' giving a realisation of 'mona lisa smile'.<br />When you watch a movie with a delicate or sensitive issues, please don't pre-judge from the very beginning...'Mona Lisa Smile' gave me a different portarit of a woman, and it was an eye-opener to me...that women are full of determination, though weakened by their emotion but the magic in them tries to overcome the pathetic attitude and that is unique among women that men don't have. Women can truly unlock their powers if they are willing enough to be what they are and conquering againsts all odds and streotyping and comparisons between man and woman. Julia Roberts, as a teacher, have done this and was shown in the movie that she wants her students to be more of a reasoning side...just like 'going beyond the painting'...'going beyond the strokes, the colors, the size, the lines, etc...\\" and that is going to the very essence of their personhood and free themselves to what avoiding them to be what they are.<br />After I watched this movie, I came out from the movie theatre wearing a smile on my face and in deep thought i said to myself...\\"Women...Women.\\"
B00007L4MJ|5.0|Fritz Lang's 1927 cinematic masterpiece METROPOLIS is arguably one of the best and most influential films EVER made...or at least the best and most influential SILENT film ever made.  As a work of cinematic art or literature, it actually functions on two levels.  First, it is an expressionistic cautionary comment on the dehumanizing effects of a mechanized high-tech society, as well as a not-so-subtle jab at the imbalanced social stratification that results from unfettered capitalism.  And secondly, it is one of the first speculative science-fiction movies, offering interesting--and in some cases, prophetic--glimpses into a potential future that offers technological advances such as common commercial flight, video-telephones, mechanical prosthetics, electronic computers, robotics, and much more.<br />The groundbreaking special FX and film techniques created for and used in METROPOLIS have left an indelible imprint on the SF and horror genres, influencing filmmakers from James Whale to George Lucas and beyond.  Indeed, the special FX seen in the robot-creation scene in METROPOLIS are obviously updated and reinterpreted in the creation scene in Whale's 1931 classic FRANKENSTEIN, and George Lucas has publicly admitted that he was inspired to create his STAR WARS character C3P0 after being awed by the robot character in Lang's film.<br />As for the plot of METROPOLIS, it is set in the year 2026 and revolves around a slice from the life of young and handsome Freder Fredersen.  Freder is the only offspring of the wealthy politician and businessman who governs the city-state of Metropolis, and as such, he lives a fairly privileged and carefree existence.  But after a happenstance encounter with the beautiful peasant Maria--she a messiah of sorts who preaches a message of peace and hope to the lower classes--Freder follows her into the bowels of Metropolis and quickly learns firsthand the true plight of his city's enslaved working class.  With this newfound social awareness, he is ashamed of the selfish excesses his class obtains on the backs of others, and he resolves to help Maria free her people from a life of perpetual toil and make Metropolis a place where all can share in both the labor AND the fruits therefrom.<br />Some contemporary audiences eschew METROPOLIS with claims that it is dated and too naive in its worldview.  While the decades since the film's creation have certainly revealed its simple socialist philosophy be both naive AND impractical, it actually isn't all that different from the feel-good subtext of many of today's films.  And there is no cogent grounds for regarding METROPOLIS to be dated or pass&eacute;, as the narrative is strong, the acting is good (relative to the silent cinema), and most--if not all--of the special FX remain aesthetically powerful and stand strong against even some of Hollywood's modern and lavish CGI FX.<br />The definitive version of METROPOLIS--at least for the English-speaking audience--is the Restored Authorized Edition from Kino International.  Not only is the image clear, sharp, and relatively clean, but at the points in the film where long-lost segments belong, intertitles are inserted that summarize those missing pieces.  So even though the full visual beauty of the work isn't restored, the logicality of the narrative is.  This is as close to the original as audiences are likely to get, and it is breathtakingly wonderful.  There are some bonus extras on the disc, too, but just having the &quot;complete&quot; masterpiece is worth the cost.<br />A must-see, nay, a MUST-OWN for both science-fiction fans and serious students of the cinema., he is ashamed of the selfish excesses his class obtains on the backs of others, and he resolves to help Maria free her people from a life of perpetual toil and make Metropolis a place where all can share in both the labor AND the fruits therefrom.<br />Some contemporary audiences eschew METROPOLIS with claims that it is dated and too naive in its worldview.

B000056NX5|4.0|Although i have seen the classic version of 'Jesus Christ Superstar' but this one captures my interest. I can't take away of comparing the classic and the modern version of this hit broadway turned movie spectacle. Unlike the classic one, this is more of a fast pace, some scenes are full of intensity, colors are vibrant and the singing comes into full swing. Of course, singing was well orchestrated and the sound is as hip as the sound of today's genre. The version from the classic movie was given new life and new twist to the rhythm and essence of the songs rendered but I have to say that the original one will always be the best because the gems are still there and you really are used to listening to it.<br />In fairness to this modern version, a breakthrough film making was done giving a 'live' portraits of a broadway, in terms of cinematography and acting performances of the stars. Although the actors of this version are full of intensity and emotion, there are some instances that they overdo their emotions which is not appropiate anymore to their lines that they were saying or singing...just observed the scene where Judas and Mary Magdalene confrontation and the intervention of Jesus and also the Last Supper...you will be the critic of this.<br />Over all, the film has done some adjustments and giving new twist to the classic broadway hit but at the end the viewers will decide which version favored to their taste after all, 'Jesus Christ Superstar' is a movie where anybody and everybody can relate to it...just be an open-minded person, that's the imprtant attitude to watch this film.
B000005AYM|5.0|Baduizm aparecio en 1997, inagurando un nuevo subgenero musical llamado &quot;Neo-Soul&quot; o &quot;Nu-Soul&quot;; (formado por artistas como D Angelo, Jill Scott.., quienes influenciados por las grandes leyendas de las musica Soul y R&amp;B de los 70 crean un nuevo concepto en la musica negra, fusionando esos elementos con &quot;spoken word&quot;, jazz, hip-hop..) <BR>Baduizm (y no Baduzzim..) es el debut de Erykah Badu, una de las grandes divas de la musica negra, su estilo cantando es frecuentemente comparado con el de la gran Billie Holiday; voz aguda, nasal y una vocalizacin y pronunciacin perfectas.<BR>Baduizm tiene un sonido muy personal, las bases no son tan pronunciadas como en el Hip-Hop, buena utilizacin de guitarras, y sobre todo de instrumentos de percusion, lo que da un sonido mucho ms cercano al Jazz o al Soul acstico que al R&amp;B.<BR>Las letras (junto a su voz) son los puntos fuertes de este disco, profundas, a veces oscuras y otras veces divertidas, tratan diferentes temas como en &quot;Otherside Of The Game&quot; donde Erykah se mete en la piel de la mujer de un &quot;drug-dealer&quot;, en &quot;Next Lifetime&quot; decide seguir con su pareja de toda la vida, despus de ser tentada por otro hombre hacia el que se siente atraida..
B00006879E|1.0|This music is Backstreet Boy revival. Remember all of those boy bands a few years back? Close your eyes and listen to this, it is the same. Whenever I see that pathetically gimicky video, I just want to smack that histrionic lead singer. The way he does a little &quot;bye-bye&quot; each time the bit of the song comes around! Ugh! Plus his stylist has him dressed up like the Dashboard guy. It seemed as if mainstream pop was going such a nice direction: Outkast, Missy, Britney's new album, which seems to share Missy Elliot and Kylie Minogue influences, etc. Please, just ignore this horrible hiccup.
B00000ADG2|5.0|Que se puede decir de este disco que no se haya dicho ya? &quot;The Miseducation..&quot; es uno de los mejores (quiza el mejor) album de R&amp;B / Hip-Hop que se han hecho en los ultimos 10 aos.

Lanzado en 1998, &quot;The Miseducation..&quot; marco el camino a seguir y fue fuente de inspiracion de la mayoria de los cantantes de musica negra del panorama actual.<BR>Lauryn Hill es, sin ninguna duda, una de las mujeres con mas talento en este negocio (cantante, MC, productora, y compositora..incluso actriz!) produjo, compuso, y arreglo todas las canciones de este disco (excepto &quot;Can t Take My Eyes Off Of You&quot; una de las 2 &quot;Bonus Tracks&quot; de este CD, que es un remake)<BR>El album comienza con &quot;Lost Ones&quot; donde podemos comprobar que Lauryn es una de las mejores MC s femeninas.

B000002JR8|1.0|This is not reccommended for anyone with an even remotely good taste in music. I say this because this is just noise. If you want heavy at least go with death metal because that is at least music. This album took no talent to make whatsoever in my opinion. I guess these other reviewers gave it such high marks because of their different mentality. Well i bought it here because i was curious to see how it sounded and it was for dirt cheap (to no surprize).
B0000AQS0F|5.0|_Firefly_ was (and will be, in film form) some of the greatest SF ever screened.  The rough &quot;found footage&quot; realist FX mimic the rough, realist approach to the future, where not everyone follows the same pandering world view (helloooo, TNG and , ugh, Enterprise!).  If I had to compare it to a Star Trek (and I suppose one has to!), I'd say it was most like DS9 (the best of the Treks) in its political and character complexity.<br />As for the person below who said _Firefly_ was right wing because the characters are &quot;bad people&quot; (and who seems to define politics in a fairly simplistic manner), that's asinine.  While I know a lot of conservatives who are fans of the show, raging liberals like me (As Dave Foley said, &quot;I'm Canadian, and therefore a communist&quot;... ;) ) tend to love it as well.  Hello, anti-globalization and corporate influence plotline?  Watch the DVD commentary on the pilot, &quot;Serenity&quot; (and for those who are interested in the technical aspects of television, Joss Whedon's commentaries are terrific--and very funny!)
B00006CXXU|5.0|There is not one song that you would want to get your money back for. The whole CD is full of #1 hits....It has all styles from Hip hop flava to R&amp;B and Pop and some personal songs....<br />You will not resent your investment
B00009V7RF|1.0|Feeling like I wanted some music a little more on the fun side, I bought this album from Best Buy after hearing good things about it. The first two songs are nothing special, but they're nothing awful either. However, when the song &quot;Let's Get Retarded&quot; hit the chorus, I knew I had made a big mistake. If the Black Eyed Peas are catering to a third-grade market, then this CD ought to hit home. I gave it one more shot and listened for a couple more tracks before we got to another one where part of the chorus went, &quot;We keep it stinky,&quot; which pretty much said it all. The final track pretty much sums up the whole album - anytime you can write a song completely bashing &quot;hate&quot;, and then on the same album completely rail on the mentally retarded, you can tell you are appealing to the lowest common denominator. I see a poster above say that this caters to the 50 Cent audience...I disagree...this CD makes 50 Cent look like a musical genius. Sometimes, lyrics don't really matter when the beats are good. In this case, nothing can get around these lyrics. It's just that bad. This CD is utter garbage and is everything wrong with the music industry. If you want some fun rap that isn't too involving, stick to the radio standbys like Jay Z. If I hear one more comparison of the Black Eyed Peas to good rap groups like Jurassic 5 and the Roots, I think I'll vomit...but then maybe I can stick it on a CD and sell it and compete with the Black Eyed Peas. The Peas are to the Roots what 10-year-old Spam is to filet mignon.
B00006CXXU|4.0|...i thought that maybe she had some good song writers working for her and that maybe it would be worth a listen. i was wrong. she wrote most of the songs on the album, and wrote them about real things, not bubble gum. it is not all the best work on earth but for an album with twenty songs on it, she hits more than she misses. she can sing, with out a doubt, at the level of Mariah and Whitney though her voice has a very different quality to it. on Stripped she enlists the help of people such as Dave Navarro and Alicia Keys for back up in some songs.   the album has increadible vocals, some good  lyrics (not all consisting of boy meets girl or heart break) and pretty good back up. but above all its not bubble gum. its real. no hidden botox in this album. its all out in the open.
B0001KL5DA|5.0|Honestly, I'm more excited for the THIRD season (arguably the best so far, with, I think, the best season closer), and season two is probably my least favorite of the three seasons so far.  BUT, the show was still great, and within the context of the series, essential viewing. <br />A good deal of season two is devoted to setting up the action for season three (For instance, the introduction of Lisa, Brenda's actions, David and Keith's relationship, etc), so it sometimes feels like more of a build-up than a payoff (especially in retrospect).  In fact, one of the main storylines is left in suspense til the season three opener.  But the remainder of these plots still remain entertaining and do have closure in one sense or another.  And of course, there's still plenty of entertaing dead-person-of-the-episode plots keeping things fresh.<br />Overall, the second season, despite it's sophomore year faults, is still some of the best that television has to offer, and a must-have for any fan.
B0001611DI|3.0|I was eagerly awaiting this DVD, and I finally got to pick it up yesterday (on the release date).  When you watch the movie, you instantly notice the great new transfer (if you've been watching it on video all these years, as I have).  That's about where the fun ends, but at least you get this awesome flick on DVD.<br />First off, I know this DVD is the &quot;regular&quot; one without all the nifty special features.  The &quot;special&quot; DVD comes out later this year.  That stated, this is basically a barebones DVD (not counting the commentary), and the extras are the usual TV spots, radio spots, galleries, and so on, but what I was looking forward to was the &quot;new collector's booklet&quot; and the &quot;exclusive preview of the upcoming comic.&quot;  Both were throwaway features offering very little to the 'Dawn of the Dead' fans.<br />The included booklet has a little sort of &quot;review&quot; type thing saying how Dawn was influential, and lists the chapters on the back.  Amazon.com says the book has four pages, but that actually means the front, the back, and the other sides of each.  So it's really one piece of paper, folded in half that's being called four pages.  The &quot;exclusive preview&quot; of the new comic is a picture of the cover and the weblink for the publishers where you can find the same information they give you on the DVD, basically.  Disappointing, if you were looking forward to these features.<br />In the end, was it worth the 15 dollars?  Yes, yes it was.  I've been waiting for this DVD for some time, and while the couple of extras I was most waiting on let me down, I'm not going to complain and claim that the disk is horrible, because it's not horrible.  I finally get to add this classic to my collection for a very reasonable price, and what a great transfer.  Plus, what I call the Super Special Edition of 'Dawn of the Dead' is supposed to be released before Halloween this year.  That will certainly be a time to celebrate for Dawn fans like myself.<br />If you are a fan (keyword: fan) waiting for the Super Special Edition, you may as well pick this up for the new transfer, if nothing else (besides, it's dirt cheap).  If you could care less about special features, but you like the flick, it would make more sense pick this one up (the Super Special Edition will be much more expensive).  I just have to plug the transfer once more before this review is over.  The transfer is great, I honestly get excited when i see how clear the picture is.  Okay, that's done.  'Dawn of the Dead' as a movie gets high praises and five stars.  This DVD gets mediocre praises and three stars.
B000002UUH|5.0|I have always been an admirer of John Lennon's work as both a member of the legendary band The Beatles as well as a solo artist. I am not what I would consider a big fan but I always had a high respect for John's work as a songwriter/singer. He was quite prolific. I bought &quot;The John Lennon Collection&quot; a few years ago. I hadn't listened to the cd in awhile until recently. I was amazed by how well songs like &quot;Instant Karma!&quot;, &quot;Imagine&quot;, &quot;#9 Dream&quot; and &quot;Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy)&quot; has hold up in over twenty years. I must admit I have soft spot for John's ballads in particular. Phil Spector's production on some of the songs adds such an amazing lush sound that I don't hear in a lot of music nowadays. I don't think there will ever be a song as beautiful and poignant as &quot;Imagine&quot;. They lyrics, the music, and Phil Spector's production was the perfect combination and the results is a timeless song that I can never tire of. But even in songs like &quot;#9 Dream&quot; which wasn't produced by Phil has such a gorgeous  airy, lush pop sensibility which almost moves me to tears because  it is such a beautiful song. Political minded songs like &quot;Give Peace A Chance&quot; and &quot;Happy Xmas(War is Over)&quot; seems more relevant today than ever. &quot;The John Lennon Collection&quot; is a nice reminder to what music lost over twenty years ago. The songs still holds up very well and remains as relevant as they were back in the '70s. Music needs more artists like John Lennon.
B000050FEN|2.0|First off, the good: This movie set a cinematographic standard for urban gothic-thrillers. The film presents its metropolis as a grity Daedalian labrynth in which around each dark corner some human vice is manifesting itself in macabre excess. It is grity, claustrophobic, and dark. Lights pulsate a sickly yellow, tight focus keeps the dark a mystery and the constant darkness implies a godless world were hedonistic lifestyles lead to extremes of degradation. Humanity is slitting its wrists. The movie's production design and cinematography are interesting, intimidating and perfect for the theme.<br />Now, the bad: That is all Se7en is! Se7en's best points are its darkness, its credits and the clever use of \\"7\\" in place of \\"v\\"! All other elements of the movie fall under \\"the bad\\"; The plot, the characters, the atempts at tenstion, the dialogue and the direction. <BR>          The Plot: A clearly extremely deranged man is going around killing people in graphic parodies of The Seven Deadly Sins. The end! That's it! The police investigation into his murders is superficial and reveals no methods the police might use to identify the killer. Furthermore the several instances where Morgan Freeman suggests exploring literary sources for <BR>clues as to what the murderer's goals might be or who he will kill next never reveal any new information to the viewer, and they seem not to convey information to the characters either. The only \\"revelation\\"(excuse the Biblicality of this wording) made by the detectives is that the killer is killing in ways relating to the Seven Deadly Sins, and we can understand that from the title! <BR>   The plot of the police investigation merely serves as a frame story to reveal each gruesome set peice of the murders. Admit it to yourself, all the time when the cops were pointlesly delineating upon how to find the killer- you were begging to be shown the next murder. The enjoyment of this movie comes from the viewers inherint interst in thr perverse fetisism of torture. We want to skip over the cops and look more at the murders. They intrigue us, the story does not. <br />         *spoiler* We end up routing for the murderer, in whose capture the movie even concedes the superflous nature of the plot, having him turn himself over.*spoiler ended*<BR>    <BR>        Somewhat interesting is the identity of the actor who plays the killer, even though everyone knows who it is, I wont reveal it. It the concealment of his identity is a nice, campy throwback to gimmick movies(which this is essentially) and monster picks( like Frankenstein). <br />       The characters: Morgan Freeman is the jaded veteran cop and Brad Pitt is the hotshot newby. The end! Interstingly enough not only are these the characters in EVERY other psychological thriller, but it is also the character Morgan Freeman plays in EVERY other psychological thriller. Their characterization is summed up in one seen where Brad Pitt decides to drink Beer and Morgan Freman decides to drink wine. Genius!<BR>        Tension: Fast forward to the last 3 minutes of the film and wait for your heartrate to raise about 1/10 past its normal rate. The end situation of the movie provides some tension, but no mystery as to what the outcome will be due to the two-dimensionality of the characters. One other scene which could be suspensful, a chase, is left predictable and uninspiring due to the almost cartoonish way in which it was shot.<BR>         Dialogue: Because the characters and plot are secondary to the gruesome props of the murders all dialogue is stunted and cliched.<BR>         Direction: Other than the depiciton of the murders the direction is loose and meandering. David Fincher knew as we did that the plot was just to provide a frame story to exhibit the murders in and thus guides as adequately enough, but in a very straight and unabitious way, though the poor dialogue and dismal atempts at characterization. <BR>          <BR>         Conclusion: The film is enjoyable, yes. It is enjoyable in a voyeuristic way. We feel sick pleasure in such extreme representations of cruelty( this is the reason we all know what Chinese water torture is). The film is nothing else though, and does not push the genre in any way. The characters are two-dimensional and the plot paper thin. See it qith friends for fun, but expect nothing as interesting as The Silence of The Lambs. It is gruesome for the sake of showing us gruesomeness.
B00018D3RI|3.0|I was never a fan of this show, although I watched it occasionally back in the day.  I bought this set from sheer nostalgia, curious to see how the show has aged.<br />My initial impression, after watching the first two episodes, is that TV has gotten a heck of a lot better in the last 30 years!  Sure we've got the reality shows and other mindless dreck, but we've also had inventive drama like \\"The Shield\\", \\"The Sopranos\\", \\"Hill Street Blues\\", and \\"NYPD Blue\\".  Compared to these more involving dramas, the cookie-cutter plots and formulaic caricatures of \\"Starsky and Hutch\\" are cartoonish.  Like \\"Charlie's Angels\\", (also produced by Spelling &amp; Goldberg) this show was never meant to be taken seriously.<br />Like most 70s shows, there's a certain dowdiness hanging over the proceedings.  It's not the tacky fashions and haircuts --- those are half the fun!  It's the overall flatness of the performances, the limpness of the editing, the lack of realism, and a certain plodding pace that contrasts wildly with modern-day \\"edge\\" shows such as \\"The Shield.\\"<br />Having said all that, there's nostalgic fun to be had here.  Almost every show I saw in the 70s had the same stylistic limitations.  Glaser and Soul are appealing, likeable leads; the sporty Gran Turino is a character in itself, the car chases are fun, the fashions and hairstyles are amusing, and of course Antonio Fargas, the blaxploitation character brought in to provide an ersatz \\"hip\\" factor, is perhaps the most talented actor on board (his subsequent career in films seems to have been more successful that Soul's or Glaser's).  If nothing else, \\"Huggy Bear's\\" unique facial features and remarkable nose are worth at least part of the admission price.<br />This is a beautifully mastered DVD set, and should please fans of the series.  This is highly recommended for those who did enjoy the show in the 70s, but will probably seem tame and corny to anyone under the age of 35.
B000002J29|5.0|In 1977 Genesis came to Dallas and played in one of the worst arenas, SMU's Moody, and made it sound like Carnegie Hall.  Up till then I had been a skeptic (being a devoted Yes fan) but the Trick of the Tail lp had definitely turned my head.  These concert performances duplicates the excitement and grandeur I experienced that night.  The drumming of Phil and Chester together is breathtaking and \\"Supper's Ready\\" has never sounded better.  Phil's vocals are unrestrained and exhilarating.  I agree with some of the other reviewers in that Genesis never attained this level of greatness after Steve Hackett left the band.  Not that he was all that great but he was a key ingredient to their signature sound.  \\"Duke\\" may have been the only album that even approached their energy of this collection afterwards but I still prefer to listen to this live masterpiece whenever I need a classic Genesis fix.  It touches all the bases.
B00009Z576|5.0|I just can't understand why this album is regarded as one of the worst in the entire Yes catalog. I think this ranks as one of the top 3 easily. It is a transitional album for sure but that does not make it bad. Trevor Horn does an admirable job on the vocals and I think the keyboards are better than they had been in years (I'm not a big Wakeman fan). What makes this one of the better albums is the musicianship of Squire, Howe and White. It is some of the best playing they had done in a long time. Also, the songs are great. I think this album exceeds Going for the One by miles. I should note I am a fan of all Yes (including  Tormato ) and Jon Anderson is missed but people have come down too hard on this album. Many people wrote off Genesis when Phil Collins took over and they also did some excellent work post-Gabriel. The bonus tracks alone are worth the price of admission, especially the instrumental jam sessions.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|There's nothing dynamic or explosive about this movie, and that's the whole point.  The two main characters are strongly drawn and compelling, and the Tokyo backdrop is sometimes comic, often lovely, and generally more like dreamscape as we drift along with the film's displaced romantic leads.  If you like action-intense movies, don't see this.  If you like gratuitous sex, don't see it.  But if you want to watch a movie with meaningful dialogue and interaction that somehow manages not to seem contrived, you will probably enjoy Lost in Translation.  Bill Murray's sad and wry performance definitely deserved an Oscar nomination, and if subtlety and nuance were more important in Hollywood, he might have won the award itself.
0767802470|5.0|This has got to be one of ,if not the, best submarine war flicks<BR>ever made. At first I did not want to cheer too loudly for the<BR>characters,them being on the wrong side of WW11 and all.

B0000399WI|5.0|There are movies made for money and movies made for the sake of propagating the Art of Cinema,these appear like Comet once in a Cinema life-time,instead of gloom and doom they lift our sullen mood-Shawashank Redemption is one such movie with the premise thatif you loose hope you stop living.&quot;Rita hayworth and Shawshank Redemption&quot; a Novella, written by the most prolific fiction writer-Stephen King, fell into the mail box of an avid reader called Frank Darabont who had relunctantly subscribed to the Book of the month Club. He read this book in passing and after the second reading bought the rights from King and after nine long incubation period came &quot;Shawshank Redemption&quot; the movie. I would be doing a disservice if divulge the story suffice to say this is a story of a convict who has more convictions in his soul than the allegged convictions and you want to hear this story from the greatest narrator of all times, Morgan Freeman,you have to see for yourself the livid performances and take my word this is like the greatest Buffet, you will keep going for more and you will never have satiety since this is the greatest drama ever told and told brilliantly by Frank Darabont. Great movies have one thing in common,a Screen writer who also wields the megaphone-like Coppola in Godfather and Scorcese in Good Fellas-God bless these kindred since they have made some great movies and Shawshank Redemption is one of them.
6305909326|3.0|&quot;. . . boo!&quot;<br />That's what Boris Balkan, whose collection of ars diavoli, works about (and by) the Devil, is unrivaled, says to a group of Satanists at the climax of director Roman Polanski's The Ninth Gate.  It's risky having a character say something sarcastic that could apply to the movie we're watching itself.  The Ninth Gate doesn't resonate with deeper meanings like Rosemary's Baby, but as a Devil movie it's literate with good acting (Johnny Depp, Frank Langella, Emmanuelle Seigner, Lena Olin).<br />As much as I like subdued character-driven horror pictures like this, I agree with David Thomson in The New Biographical Dictionary of Film that it doesn't seem like Roman Polanski's film.  If I didn't already know Polanski directed it, I wouldn't have guessed.<br /><br />I did like the ending.  It wasn't one of the apocalyptic clich&eacute;s that usually wrap up this kind of horror film.  And it leaves one character's nature not completely explained.<br />I guess you can't do a Devil movie without mumbo jumbo.  Here Lena Olin's Baroness (or whatever) de St. Martin recites a Latin incantation; in Rosemary's Baby the coven next door to Rosemary and Guy murmur spells.  If you're going to summon the Prince of Darkness you've got to sacrifice a virgin, or at least call him on his cell.
6304696515|3.0|I first saw this on VHS a few years ago, and remember being stunned by the great acting, the rich costumes, fine settings, not to mention the sheer depravity of the tale;  easily 4-5 stars.  Then, purely by chance this year, I bought a copy of Untold Scandal, not realising it was a Korean version of the same story.  Wow!  Folks, this is how it should be done.   <BR>Intrigued, I dug out my old tape and watched it again.  The performances still stand up, but the film-making looks jerky, crude, graceless.  Still worth watching?  Yes;  but get hold of Untold Scandal too.  You won't be sorry.
B0001611DI|5.0|The dead are still rising! It's been ten years since \\"Night Of The Living Dead\\", when things seemed to be under control. Nope, the dead have continued their rampage, killing and eating us normal folks like so many zombie-treats! Our major cities are under marshall law. The military is fighting a losing battle against the flesh-eating hordes, while the media debates the issue. Meanwhile, two cops and two media personel pile into a helicopter to escape to... where?? They have no real idea. Flying over the countryside, they witness the great \\"hillbilly zombie hunt\\" below, as bands of good ol' boys drink beer, shoot zombies, drink more beer, shoot more zombies, etc. Later, our heroes land to gas up the helicopter, where they encounter a handful of shambling dead. The dead are of course, easily dispatched by blows / shots to the noggin, but they prove to be dangerous nonetheless! Even two kid-zombies are relentless in their pursuit of warm human flesh! Our four survivors get fueled up and take off again. Then, in the distance, like an oasis of safety, is a gigantic shopping mall! The helicopter lands on the roof, and our small group enters through a sky-light. Upon checking things out, they find the mall to be a veritable fortress, even though slow-moving zombies roam around both inside and out. The four soon create their own home-away-from-home, killing as many dead-heads as possible along the way. They get pretty comfy in their newfound kingdom of the living. Along comes a caravan of bikers to spice things up! They break into the mall, shooting and smacking zombies with sledgehammers, and basically causing mayhem. Our four heroes must lay low until the bikers get tired of playing around. Oh no! One of the four, named Steve, can't take it, and simply must defend \\"his\\" mall! He shoots at the marauding bikers, and things get ugly from there! See, no one's noticed that the zombies have been flooding in and now out-number the bikers by about ten to one. In their subtle, creeping way, they sneek right up and take over. ATTENTION SHOPPERS! IT'S BIKER-GANG GUTS DAY AT THE MALL! Can our four heroes endure to the end? I won't give away the climax. DOTD belongs on every horror shelf! A bloody, entrail-filled masterpiece...
B000066NW0|1.0|X-Tina Aguilera should give this gal some vocal lessons, cuz she can't sing for jacks***.  Then she and Britney can teach her how to dance. My 10 yr. old sis writes better poetry than the lyrical content on this CD...come to think of it, she sings better too.  What I really hate is a girl who has no talent AND can't perform live.  Her warbling voice on and off the album is terrible.  She could at least TRY to dance instead of jumping up and down in front of the mic like a bunny rabbit on crack.  Britney is more talented.  X-Tina is more talented.  Hell, ASHANTI is more talented than Avril! You lovers say she writes her own music yet when the lyrics suck this bad, you almost wish they'd hired a writer.  See, Norah did not write the lyrics for Come Away With Me and I still adore her!  Avril has no talent.  Y'all need to wakeup if you think otherwise.  And nor is she the #1 role model of pop culture, either...she dresses like a dyke.  You can't rhyme boi w/ boi, which is something Avril does, abusing the privilege of poetic license.  At least this album is child-friendly, except for the word \\"ass\\" and maybe \\"damn\\" or something.  Kids with no taste will love this one!!!
0553212737|3.0|As good as this book is, it is slow to start does not really pick up until after the 150 pages or so. But stick with it. However, those looking for an introduction to Jane Austen might be better suited with faster paced Pride &amp; Prejudice and gradually make your way toward this one.<br />Two things that I liked very much about this book. The lead character is a likable but strong willed heroine with fixed ideas and the author is not afraid to use that to a disadvantage. Emma is flawed and it makes her interesting to read. Also, you get a stronger sense of community in a small victorian town and how they relied on one another found here than any of her other works that I have read. It's a very charming enjoyable aspect that works in the books favor. As far as premise goes, this is one of the more cohesive and linear of Austen's works and I can see the reason why this has been this has been adapted to film and stage so many times.<br />What I liked about Bantams edition was there was no droll introduction or afterward by a scholar indicating why the book and author are important and lets the work speak for itself. What they did have was useful footnotes when the characters were referencing now obscure objects, writers and poets making the book more accessible. <br />But as well as the book starting slowly, the other problem I had was that I found myself not emotionally investing in the characters. Emma is likeable, as stated before, but that was about it. Despite her appeal, she has no impact. Same goes with everyone else save for Miss Bates. The town spinster had me in stitches with her rambling monologues and sweet nature. When someone picks on her, it does make an impact.<br />A nice story, just not a great one. Outside of the reservations mentioned, I'm glad I read it and recommend it.
B000005JA8|5.0|The people who gave this CD a low rating miss the point.  Trout Mask is over their heads.  I would guess then more into the stagnant music of today.  Keep it in 4/4, don't think, don't do anything original.  However, if you have an open mind and an adventurous spirit, then give this CD a try.  For me, this is music unlike anything I've ever heard.  Completely fresh and unique.  Nothing since has come close to it's originality.  A bizarre blend of delta blues, poetry, rock and free jazz.  Ignore the reviewers who don't get it and break free of the corporate produced 4/4 music.  This is the real deal.
B00005JKDR|5.0|This is one of the best recent children's movies to come out, in my opinion. I absolutely loved all the characters in it, especially the little girl.<BR>True, the story isn't anything deep and it's not something that's going to make you think on it for hours, but it was still touching and the characters were well made - each had a distinctive, likeable personality (well, not the bad guy of course).<BR>The story was something pretty new and the concept was very cute and interesting. Unlike other recent children's movies *cough* finding nemo *cough*, the plot wasn't completely straight-forward and kept me on my toes at certain points.<BR>I REALLY liked it and I highly reccomend it. If you are going to buy a single children's movie this year, I'd say get this one!
B00005JMJ4|4.0|Bill Murray is perfect and great fun to watch, but he is actually probably just being himself.  Scarlet Johansson is intriguing, as always.  And she has never looked so beautiful!  If you like her and haven't seen Ghost World, then be sure to check that one out.  She's great in it and it's a better movie than Lost in Translation too.<br />In Lost in Translation much of the humor is dry and understated, perhaps even a little obscure.  To me the most interesting thing about this film, besides the acting, is the scenery in Tokyo and seeing how some people live there.  I don't recall many movies set in Tokyo - maybe it's too expensive to film there -- so that was pleasantly different.  <br />The story, however, is thin.  And was all that cigarette smoking and booze guzzling necessary?  I don't think so.  I felt like I was watching a movie made in the 1950's.  Maybe the producer got a lot of money from whiskey and cigarette companies...  It's disheartening to me to see films made these days still displaying such things that everyone knows is harmful to people, especially when it is not necessary to the story.  Bill and Scarlett are smart and interesting characters in this film, but are diminished by these actions.<br />So overall, it's quite entertaining, but not great or profound or really special.  After all, it was probably mostly just a practice exercise for Francis Ford Coppola's daughter Sofia, the writer / director.  So just enjoy watching Bill and Scarlett and seeing Tokyo, and don't expect much more, then you will enjoy the movie and not be too disappointed by the lack of a real story.
B00005JM02|2.0|People told me over and over again how hilarious this movie was, building up a lot of hype, but I just couldn't find myself amused at the concept of a serious memory problem funny and about half of the jokes in the movie were repetitions of &#34;wait...what did you say 30 seconds ago?&#34;
B000002NFM|5.0|Best techno album ive ever heard to this day. Released in 97 and years ahead of its time /this is a masterpiece. The beats and power of the songs is incredible.

B00005JKCH|2.0|A hokey script doesn't help matters either. This movie is tired, poor, boring, BADLY acted and VERY BADLY written. Can you believe the cheezy dialogue here? &quot;I swear Spider Man will pay... thank God for YOU, Peter.&quot; It's like, why not throw in a wink too, there, Harry. And let's not forget Peter's tired &quot;sense of humor&quot;. What does he say? Stupid 5h!+ like &quot;Hehe! Sure beats the subway!&quot; and &quot;nice outfit, did your husband buy it for you?&quot; This movie is TERRIBLE! The CGI is horrid as well. Spider Man hasn't looked THIS cartoony since the 1960 series. Green Goblin looks like an overgrown action-figure. Willem's acting reaches low camp. Kirstin Dunst is neither stunning nor talented. She is not Mary Jane. Just as Tobey is not Peter Parker. Comatose b@5+@rd. Let's hope this stupid 5h!t picks up in sequels like X-Men. What a stupid boring movie this is.
0761536434|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend and i must say that I am very glad that I purchased it.  I'm not totally finished with it, I'm a little over half way through.  I felt that this book was a fairly complete source of videogame history, but after reading other reviews for the book, I must agree that this book did leave a lot out.  There's simply too much information to cover in just one book though.  It would be ridiculous to try to cover the entire history of videogames in just one year.  What I found most impressive about this book is how entertaining it is.  I do not enjoy reading at all, I'd rather read a text book than a novel simply because I'll learn more from the textbook.  However, I read half of this book, which is about 300 pages in just a couple days, and that time actually consisted of all of my free time.  There are so many interesting facts in this book.  I love it and would recommend it to anyone who is curious about the history of videogames.
6305014140|3.0|For years I was telling people that Ninja Scroll was one of the worst Anime Features I had ever seen.  the lack of plot was instead replaced with numerouse violence and sex scenes with an unclear villian.  Finally I rented this again and watched it and after the third and final viewing of this, I have come to realize that this is Ok at best for those reasons.  It is not the worse anime feature I have ever seen but it is by far not the best.<br />the story revolves around a wandering swordsman who teams up fith a female ninja who can poison anyone just by having sex with them and a dirty old man to stop seven demons from conquering the world.  Throughout the battles with the demons range in style as each has their own techniques.  In the end they of course win but not without casulties.<br />This is an OK entry and is highly respected because it was one of the first Anime titles to get mainstream attention (Next to Speed Racer and Akira).  This is OK, but for Hardcore Anime fans only
B00018D3RI|5.0|I was so excited this finally came out on DVD!!  I just hope the other seasons come out as well!<br />I watched this show religiously as a teenager in the '70's.  There was nothing else like it on TV.  What made the show were the actors/characters.  The chemistry, the friendship, whatever you want to call it flew off of the screen.  In the mid '70's when all the guys were so macho, here were two guys who weren't afraid to show how they cared for each other - and at the same time remaining macho!  This was what the show was about.  Never mind that the plots were a little lame and pretty predictable.  My friends and I tuned in every week for 5 years to watch what went on between the two buddys.  <br />The quality of the DVDs are excellent and I love the new interviews with Paul and David and Antonio.  Outakes would have been fun and I bet there were a lot of them!  Maybe on the next release of Season 2????<br />I won't go and see the movie.  I'm upset that Hollywood took a serious cop show and turned it into a farce.  I would much rather see Starsky &amp; Hutch 20 years later.  What happened to them, where are they now kind of movie.  Maybe that would be something to think about???
B00005JLZN|5.0|A very strong story and supported by the fact that is based on a true story. It doesn't really matter if you are pro or against the death penalty, it will leave you with a big question mark. Although some scenes seem obvious they are not. This is a must see movie!
B0001611DI|4.0|I awaited this release of this DVD(3-9-04)with much excitement, as I've been an enthusiastic (one might even say 'zombie-like') follower of Romero's 'Dead' trilogy since childhood. And for the most part, it was worth the wait.<BR>The print is beautifully clean, vivid, and the audio remastering to 5.1 surround is something to behold (experiencing this DVD after years of VHS is almost like watching it for the first time). The technical merits of those who put this DVD together cannot be disputed, and the film AND the DVD deliver the goods on almost every level. <BR>The audio commentary (Romero, his wife/assistant dir. Chris Romero, FX man Tom Savini, and Peter Martin) is great fun, mostly informative (with a lot of laughing and reminiscing, which is a treat!)...Like partying with the filmmakers.<BR>But the extras are a bit sparse if you aren't keen on sitting through ten variations of the same ad (for the television and radio spots, it's tough to find differences, other than length). The two theatrical trailers are nice, especially the first U.S. trailer... I remembered seeing this trailer originally, at age 11, and just the TRAILER scared me silly! It's nice to have that on disc. <BR>The jacket of the DVD mentions a 'sneak peek' at the new comic book version of DOTD coming this Fall, but it's only a quick look at the cover of an issue, then you hit 'more' and it gives a short paragraph that is just an advertisement for the comic. So no substance there, it comes off silly to hype such a miniscule 'peek'. <BR>This is not the fullest treatment of the film on DVD, but wait...<BR>Apparently there will be a multi-disc, far more in-depth DVD set of this film coming in September, and THAT will definitely be worth it. But even as sparse as this current version is (not the full director's cut, few extras, etc.) it's a GREAT way to have this classic film in your library until the BIG set comes along. At under $15, for the horror fan and followers of Romero, it won't disappointmuch, if at all, and it's a great teaser for the full set to come.
B0001611DI|4.0|I haven't even watched this DVD yet, but the packaging already made a bad impression.  The seal you have to remove to open the DVD was glued on so well that I pretty much destroyed the DVD case trying to peal it off.  Pretty soon I will stop buying DVDs if it is going to be this much of a hassle just to open them.
0792164903|5.0|This movie is great.  Everything you will see in it was created or put together for the movie.  Even the forest was designed and put together inside a studio for the movie.  The old windmill was built outside the studio and the computer guys added everything that is around using digital images.<br />The head of the headless horseman was erased digitally and Sleepy Hollow Village was also built in several months to create the perfect environment for this wondefully scary movie.<br />The music is intense and sometimes almost romantic.  The movie is scary but funny, bloody but romantic, dense and intense but beautiful.
B00005JLCI|5.0|Kenneth Branagh has proved beyond a doubt that he is not only the greatest Shakesperian actor of our time but also a brilliant director of the same's works. (See Henry V and Much Ado About Nothing). The sets are stunning and the music enhances the action probably beyond what the bard himself could have imagine.<BR>    The casting of Branagh regulars, Derek Jacobi as Claudius (narrator in Henry V) Brian Blessed as the ghost of Hamlet (Duke of Exeter in Henry V) is amazing. To top that off he adds Billy Crystol as the grave digger, Robin Williams as the fop  Osric, Laetes second in the duel, and Depardeau as Polonius's servent are splendid.<BR>    It's hard to believe that a 4 hour movie can so completely absorb you but this one does.
0060537639|4.0|This book tells us some facts about which few occidentals know and the Chinese deem as of course. But, saying that the Chinese first found the America and even circumnavigated the globe, it seems stretching the imagination too far; that is, there is no enough solid evidence to support this hypothesis. Furthermore, to impose all the blames on the Confucian officials who insisted on stopping the voyages is also unfair. Serials of contingencies and necessities lead to this calamitous mistake that the modern Chinese still feel its bitterness.<BR>The Ming Dynasty (1368 - 1644) was the last ethnic Han Chinese dynasty to rule the empire. The former dynasty, which was called Yuan Dynasty, was founded by Mongols; also, it is the first time that the whole China was conquered by foreigners. The Mings successive dynasty is Manchu Qing Dynasty, the second and last dynasty ruled by a minority regime. What humiliated the Chinese most is that at that time both the Mongols and the Manchu were despised as barbarians. In the movie, the Lord of the Rings: the Return of the King, one scenario impresses me deeply: Denethor, the steward of Gondor, despairingly and helplessly panicked at the orcs that surrounded his city. The mood of Mings emperors was the same as Dethenors. The Confucian official persuaded the emperor to give up the voyage not only because of wasting resource but also because of the emerging threat on the northern border. The Mongols who had been expelled were rallying and stirring again. There was no exaggeration. Although the Great Wall was rebuilt and consolidated, about twenty years later, the Beijing city was raided and pillaged again by Mongols and the Yingzong Emperor, the grandson of Zhu Di who was the patron of Zheng He armada, was captured by Mongols. Although finally the invading Mongols were routed again, a series of disasters that at last led to the collapse of Ming Dynasty began to befall.<BR>Because of the sudden withdraw of the great navy ofMing, there is a vast area of marine power vacuum along the prosperous, peaceful and affluent southeast coast of China, which was coveted by marauders for a long time.  In 16th century, driven by unknown evils, gangs of the Japanese pirates, like Vikings in Europe, stormed out of their dens and looted all of the important cities of the Chinese east coast. They killed, burned, robbed and left the whole city ruined after they passed. At first the Ming people were appalled by these barbarians, but for tens of years, they fought manfully and finally got rid of these buccaneers from their homelands. Nevertheless, the economy of the whole east coast was undermined and it would never recover until the fall of the Ming Dynasty. If the formidable navy of Ming was kept and could forestall the pirates, the tragedy could never happen. <BR>But the Japanese would not rest. In Shenzong Emperor period, one Japanese overlord united most of the tribes and he felt that he had some ability to show his muscles. This time the prey is Korean. The relation between Ming Dynasty and Korean was somewhat like that between Gondor and Rohan. When the despaired King of Korean asked for help the Ming Emperor had no choice but sent one army to the Korean peninsula to resist the Japanese invaders. After seven years of exhaustive struggle the Japanese was forced out Korean. But the treasury of Ming was depleted. <BR>There was no opportunity for the Ming to have a gasp. In the last forty years of Ming Dynasty all of the factors that could cause the empire to collapse gathered: the mismanagement of government, the inept emperors, the corruption of officials, the unrestrained eunuch power, the internecine among different court cabals and the unfortunate natural catastrophe. Continuous burdens were imposed upon the peasants who had already been taxed to the bone. The bankrupted peasants became vagabonds and then became rebels. <BR>The Manchu were always keeping their eyes on the Ming sleeplessly. For a long time, in the northeast of China, as subjects of Ming, the Manchu craved for the affluence and glory of Ming and waited for their opportunities. Now they thought that it was the proper time to rebel. So the thirty years of ceaseless and ruthless attacks began. The strength of Ming was finally sapped. The whole empire was swirled by the rebels. When the rebellious peasants occupied the capital Beijing, in the turmoil, the Manchu broke the Great Wall and finally took over the whole country.<BR>The Manchu founded a new dynasty, Qing Dynasty, which is the most cursed by the modern Chinese. And for nearly three hundred years the majority Han people would be ruled by the minority Manchu whose population is no more than one percent of the whole population. The Koreans sympathized the Han people and despised the Manchu as heathens. They claimed that they would be the successor of the real Chinese culture. In fact, the culture of Manchu was so wretched that even they themselves felt self-contempt and had no choice but accepted the whole culture of Han people. As a consequence the Manchu tried their best to be Chinese and stubbornly refused to do any reform in order to cater to the conservatives and to insure their reign. So the Chinese was totally out of the track of worldwide development.<BR>When the Manchus reign was finally overthrown by the furious Han people in 1911, the Chinese found that their country had become one of the poorest in the world. The recent three hundred years was like a nightmare. And the Ming Dynasty seems so distant and almost like a dream. The pivotal point of their fate is exact the moment when their ancestors destroyed Zheng Hes magnificent navy.<BR>When the first Chinese spaceship was launched and carried one astronaut to explore the outer space in 2003, there are many cries around the country: why we wasted so much money on this kind of project? There was one answer that really struck the nerves of the Chinese: we just do not want our descendants to complain us later as we complain our ancestors now.
0783110871|4.0|TURBULENCE, directed by Robert Butler, is one of those escapist movies where you can't focus too much on the plot or the pure stupidity of the writers.  Here's some thoughts:<br />THE SCRIPT:  Does well, even though it's not hard to see from the beginning that Liotta's character is as evil as Elizondo's says he is---big problem, though:  the writer has Lauren Holly doing some really stupid things, like leaving the cockpit, engaging in a conversation with her would-be killer, and frequently disregarding the people who are trying to land the plane!  SCORE:  2<br />THE CAST:  Ray Liotta goes over the top, but he's such a commanding actor that it works beautifully; Lauren Holly does well considering what the script does to her character; Rachel Ticoctin is warm and fuzzy as one of the flight navigators; Catherine Hicks (Child's Play) does a good job and doesn't deserve what happens to her, either; and Brendan Gleeson(28 Days Later) is vile as the prisoner who starts the whole mess.  SCORE:  4<br />TECHNICALLY:  Special fx are not overwhelming, but good; the scene where the plane crashes into the karaoke bar is stunning; the direction is fast-paced, but he should have strangled the writer; good sound editing.  SCORE:  4<br />SUMMARY:  Entertaining &quot;Hollywood&quot; movie; not as bad as some others felt.
0156027321|5.0|Yann Martel tells the story of a boy and a tiger with such simplistic ease that somewhere in the corner of your mind, you wonder if he is playing with your head. His description of the zoo and all the animals is so vivid and brilliant, the picture he paints of Pondicherry so colorful and the way that he finds so many distinctive and vibrant characters in the middle of a cold, pale and meaningless ocean is simply unforgettable. <BR>In his own subtle way Martel reminds you that there is a God up there, in any form or avatar you seek him. He doesn't throw religion at your face but makes you look through the eyes of a teenage boy who is trying to discover his faith. He does find that that faith and that combined with his willpower to live and his devotion to life and God's love, he survives to tell his tale. <br />Prathima Rodrigues
B00014K5TQ|3.0|This movie is pretty fierce, Seth Green and Mcaulay Culkin had me convinced that they were on drugs.  This movie is very graphic, very hilarious, shows how messed up people are, and how much we love to watch them.  I would have liked to have gone to one of their parties, unfortunately I never had a chance to check out the N.Y. party scene.
2266104535|5.0|Ce livre est tout simplement excellent.  Parmi les meilleurs que j'ai lus !
B00007G1ZC|5.0|I love this movie, Kurosawa is such a master, so able to bring life to the screen.  His fantastic use of color and placement along with the mysteries of the ancient Japanese culture make for a delightful viewing experience.  Very dreamlike in its progress, this movie follows the changes of Kurosawa's dreams from youth to old age.
B0000VAFO0|1.0|I'm a big fan of vampire movies and special effects. Blade was an awesome movie, and from the previews Underworld certainly appeared to promise the same action and level of acting. Unfortunately once the first few minutes of action were over, the movie began to fall apart. The basic premise was great; an ancient war between vampires and werewolves. The story and its execution, however, did not live up to the possibilities. As much as I was looking forward to this movie I found that even I had a hard time sitting through the whole DVD. Very disappointing. My copy went straight to ebay...
B00005JLYW|3.0|It took me a few minutes to get into this movie.  The opening sequence was very over-the-top, and I had to watch for a little bit to see where they were going with the movie, eventually it made sense.  This installment of the Charlie's Angels saga was more fantastic than the previous, presented in an almost comic book style.  It wasn't terrible, not as good as the first, but worth a watch.
0783233477|1.0|I would rather be MACE'ed twice than watch this movie again.  I feel like making Anthony Hopkins, Brad Pitt and whats her face watch me take a dump for 3 hours so they will know how I felt watching this movie.  I did give it 1 star though cuz that one chick is some eye candy even though she spends the whole movie crying about her dad dying or anything else...I did feel really bad for her, must be hard being the extremely rich daughter of a gazillionaire...boo hoo hoo.  Lets see...what else sucked about this movie...oh yeah, the half-retarded grim reaper.  I would fire Joe Black if he worked for me, his job is to kill people and instead he goes around eating peanut butter and cookies like an idiot.  Brad Pitt getting tagged with the car was pretty sweet also, that got weighted into my 1 star rating.  Too bad Anthony Hopkins couldn't get mowed over by a bus or something also and we all could have saved a few hours of our life.  Too all these people that are sprung on this movie I say get a life and get a hobby.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|You know, somehow I missed this movie. I didn't even know about it until the title was mentioned after a local alternative station played &quot;Mad World&quot;. I picked it up for $10 in a local store's bargain bin.<br />Anywho, the movie was great. I'm probably missing the whole point somehow, but I perceived it as a big wad of despair, mixed with life-affirmation and the constant threat that one side of your confused self is right. Kind of like a mix between American Beauty and The Butterfly Effect.<br />I'll end up watching it a second time sometime, but the first time around, I didn't figure out whether everyone involved in the story was granted an epiphany at the end of the movie or if Darko himself was responsible for the visions he received.
0156027321|5.0|The ending is a great surprise - something I enjoy in a book.
B000088E6P|3.0|The songs are great except &quot;Lifes' on tha line&quot; where somebody else does the rapping instead of 50 (unless he just sounds that different). All the songs are great. The intro[s] are good. Only problem with this version is it is TOO clean. I mean, why should words like;gun,shot,blood,pop,and murder be edited? I would reccommend the derrty version, but he uses super strong language and unless u bought this so ur mom would think u had clean rap, then it's (the derrty version) is just too explicit.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|What's all the fuss about this movie? Definitely not Oscar material, in my opinion. Neither the acting nor the directing. I'm glad I only rented it.
B00006690G|4.0|A great cd for Eminem fans or Dre fans [as he along with D-12 and Obie, among others, make several appearences]. The only real problem is the sort-of anti-black song, &quot;White America&quot;, whitch doesn't make sense as he has plenty o' black &quot;friends&quot;. EX: 50Cent,Obie Trice,Dr.Dre, and others. Other then that though it is great although hev on the F-word.
0790744759|5.0|Seems like most movie historians pick &quot;Singing In The Rain&quot; as the greatest musical ever.  Or &quot;West Side Story.&quot;  While those are certainly great films, I've always thought &quot;Meet Me In St Louis&quot; to be the best.  The musical numbers flow naturally out of the very moving story, rather than actors just spontaneously bursting into song, which I've never cared for.  This is to the musical what &quot;It's A Wonderful Life&quot; is to drama.  In spite of the claim by one reviewer that this film may have caused generations of juvenile delinquency, I still strongly recommend it for purchase.  If you let your children watch it, I'm sure a couple of therapy sessions will straighten them out.  Or a couple of hours playing video games or watching NICK TOONS will put them back on the right path.
B00000099Y|5.0|Not by much but this is the best CD ever created. The vocals that Maynard provides are so melodic. The guitar done by Adam Jones is absoultly amazing and i love every song. The drums as with all TOOL albums are astonishing.  And the bassist Justin Chancellor has such mellody that it is almost un-real. For any one who dosent have it should. It is a must buy.
0767805712|5.0|Gattaca is one of the most though-provoking and enthralling films that I have seen. Gattaca reminds us what is the essence of life - following one's passion and dreams and making the best of what is bestowed to us - and that the our courage and spirit is what defines us.
B000002MU3|4.0|granted, monster isn't r.e.m.'s finest, most shining moment. but throughout the twelve songs here, there's some sparkling moments-&quot;strange currencies&quot;, most noteably. someone previously mentioned u2's &quot;achtung, baby&quot;, and i see this album as an emotional counterpart to it (if majorly sonically different). bitter, bitingly sarcastic and open (when stipe's lyrics are actually discernable), this has actually been, in recent years, the r.e.m. record i run to most.
B00012QM8G|5.0|Back in 1993, I watched this film a total of two times. Once in the theater, and once on video when it was released. After just two viewings, I knew that I was watching not only a classic, but a film that was incredibly deep and complex. It became my fourth favorite film of all time. Schindler's List is nothing short of amazing; it's a film for which films were made.<br />Steven Spielberg took Thomas Keneally's book and adapted into it a film exposing the horror's of the Holocaust, while at the same time, giving us a candle of hope. Oskar Schindler, a somewhat lecherous character, starts out associating with the Nazi's to further his business career, to make money. But soon, he's drawn into the plight of the Jews of Poland, and soon conspires to start saving as many of them as possible. Through his machinatons, Schindler was able to manipulate a system totally out -of-control, and work within it to rescue people who have no hope of controlling their futures.<br />One of the first images we see of intolerance occurs when the Jews in Poland are forced to relocate to the Warsaw Ghetto. Spielberg premonates the horror by having a little girl stand alongside the people carrying their belongs screaming \\"Godobye Jews! Goodbye Jews\\" as other children pelt the people with dirt and rocks. Spielberg slowly builds the atrocities to allow us to experience it, and take it in. Just when you think it couldn't get worse, it does. It's shocking, but necessary to watch: shooting people without reason, poisioning hospital patients to save them from being slautered, the separation of families. It is not easy to watch, but watch you must.<br />Embedded in this movie are the stories of many of the Survivors. There are many small details that make this extremely real, and personal. From hiding jewelry in bread and swallowing it, to having a little boy save a mother and her daughter, these are stories that would have been lost had it not been for Spielberg or Keneally.<br />Both Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes turn in performances that are extraordinary. Especially Fiennes, who plays Amon Goeth, a vicious Nazi who has completely lost his humanity.<br />Schindler, in the middle of it all, makes his attempt to pull as many people from his situation as possible. Through his courage, deceit, and intelligence, Schindler manages to save many people, but he worries, not enough. This film has one of the most powerful endings I have ever seen in any film, impossible to watch with a dry eye.<br />This is a film that everyone simply must see, and learn from it, so that we may never have to make a film like this, again.and Ralph Fiennes turn in performances that are extraordinary.

0385504209|3.0|This is an action oriented tale that is pure entertainment. It unfortunately does not offer any character development of the main characters. We never learn much about them at all, little background or relationship information.  Once you read the first page; it takes off from there on a fast-paced at time frantic tale.<br />The story is based on a historical conspiracy theory that the author takes seriously but that lacks ALL credible evidence. For each assertion, there a hundreds of valid refutations that immediately jump out. The author is making a case that is so outlandish it is beyond being debatable.<br />I did enjoy reading it but had to completely ignore many of the claims made regarding art, history, religion and secret societies due to their lack of credibility.<br />I am really surprised that a book based on such erroneous and illogical claims could have been published at all and then be so popular.<br />If anyone actually is swayed by the story's claims, just look at The Case for Christ by Lee Strobel or especially Josh McDowell's Evidence that Demands a Verdict, among other Christian books that offer evidence for all aspects of Christianity. They offer historical, spiritual, religious, and scientific evidence of the verity of Christianity, as opposed to this book's conspiracy theories.<br />The truth concerning the issues relating to Jesus' life in this book are not mysteries as they are treated here. There has been more research and study of Jesus' life than anyone else in history. If the validity of his story and of the Bible was so ambiguous, neither would have stood against all the opposition to them both. Something built on lies and fraud cannot withstand the violent attacks levied against the early Christians.<br />Besides, this book purports that Constantine initiated a great fraud that caused the Catholic Church and Christianity to be based on lies. Well Christianity was already 300 years old by that time, and the Catholic church is not synomous with Christianity. The author doesn't even address the initial growth of Christianity in the centuries immediately following the life of Christ. All of his logic follows this pattern--extremely shallow and easily diputed.<br />You won't be missing much if you don't read it; if you do read it, you are sure to be entertained but not taught a history or religious lesson.with Christianity.

B0000DD7LB|5.0|I'm so happy I decided to give this album a chance because it's absolutely amazing!  I'm not a huge fan of pop music, but I'm very familiar with the genre, and I have to say this is the best pop record I've ever listened to!  I've gotta give it up to Britney for making such a fantastic album in which every single track is great!  I listen to the entire album without skipping any tracks, which is quite a feat for me!  Whether you're a fan of pop music or not, I guarantee you'll find something appealing about this album!  I'm truly in love with it, which is something I never would have predicted!  If you give this album a chance, I'm sure you'll feel the same way!!
B00005NP04|5.0|A classic collection of greatest hits from one of country music's greatest singers. I initially gave this album a score of 4.7, but then figured I might as well just round it up to a 5. :-)
B000002KE2|4.0|This is the first album where Sabbath began to experiment. In other words, they changed their sound a bit. The first three albums, to me, seem like they came off the same slab; the music is drenched with heavy guitars and mysterious lyrics. On vol. 4, Sabbath began to write more mainstream songs, not just songs about dark stuff. <br />1. Wheels of Confusion/The Straightener 10/10. This song is so bad ass, my favorite part is the straightener. Classic Sabbath.<br />2. Tommorrow's Dream 5/10. I don't like this song, this is the perfect example of the more mainstream rock songs I was talking about. Decent, but just not very Sabbath and kind of lame.<br />3. Changes 7/10. Great song, but not Sabbath. This sounds like Ozzy solo.<br />4. F/X 0/10. This song is so useless; it's just a bunch of sounds that you can barely even hear. I prefer Sabbath's better instrumental segues like Orchid, Embryo, etc. - waste of space on the disc.<br />5. Supernaut 8/10. I love the guitar riff in this song, but the lyrics are kind of weak.<br />6. Snowblind 10/10. I love this song, it just gets better every time I listen to it; Bill ward's drumming during the verses is amazing, but I can only appreciate in the car, cause that's my best stereo.<br />7. Cornucopia 9/10. Classic Sabbath; great lyrics, great riff.<br />8. Laguna sunrise 10/10. Terriffic instrumental from Iommi.<br />9. St. Vitus's Dance 7/10. A good song, but too short and it kind of sounds a little like &quot;after forever&quot;<br />10. Under the Sun/Every Day Just Comes and Goes 10/10. One of my all-time favorite guitar riffs with good lyrics - great way to end the album.  <br />Well, there you have it, but then again, this is just my opinion.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|If it hadn't been for Bill and Scarlett, I would have given this thing a big fat zero.  These two stars did a brilliant job with lackluster material.  Was almost worth watching to see them.  Definitely not re-watchable or buyable.  (The script was rife with racial slurs toward the Japanese culture which was very offensive.)  What was Oscar thinking??????
B0000AQS0F|5.0|&quot;Firefly&quot; is an excellent show that was poorly run by FOX during 2002(Fall).  However, it's fandom has grown by word of mouth, and is a great by.  The characters on the dvd's are witty, intelligent, and more often than not, try to do the right thing no matter the cost.  With a movie(called &quot;Serenity&quot;) going into production Summer 2004, with an expected theatre release in 2005, this series is a must have!  Enjoy!
0553277472|3.0|I read the first half of the book with rapt attention, but when Pirsig starts to call Tao &quot;quality&quot; he is way off. Taoism has absolutely nothing to do with quality, it is literally translated as &quot;The Way.&quot; It is roughly equivalent to Zen, which means &quot;Meditation.&quot; Tao is undefinable in words, but if I had to I certainly would not describe it with such a capitalistic word. If anything, Tao is mindfulness, being in the present moment rather than in the past or future. I suppose back when the book was written there were not many good Eastern translations for Pirsig to imitate? By today's standards, his thoughts seem rather shallow and trite.
B00005JLTR|4.0|I remember my mom watching this movie when I was a child.  She would watch it every chance that she got to.  She was a big Barbra Striesand fan anyway & has made me one too.  I love this movie still to this day & it will always continue to be an all-time favorite.  Every time that I see it - it always bring back such nice memories from being a child.  I can't wait for it come out on DVD!!!!
0385504209|2.0|I bought this book after I read a newspaper review promising me an intellectual thriller full of clever puzzles and intriguing historical references. What a disappointment. The history is full of annoying minor and sometimes major errors and at least one glaring math error (an order founded in 1099 isn't more than a millennium old). The puzzles aren't particularly ingenious (why was the professional cryptographer unable to figure out the code to her granddad's bank vault while I got it at once?). Thrilling? Yes, the first 300 pages. Hence the extra star on top of the minimum of one.<br />However, the worst thing is, that this is just a rehash of Holy Blood, Holy Grail in novel format without adding anything of importance. I feared as much very early on, when the family name of the victim turned out to be Sauniere. If the review had mentioned this, I'd never have bought the book. I even wonder if Dan Brown wasn't hired by the remaining two of the original three authors of HBHG to rescue them from oblivion (they're in the book as Leigh Teabing: Leigh = Leigh...; Baigent = Teabing - I've seen better anagrams).<br />I really wish that reviewer hadn't been so clueless. I feel cheated.
B00005JMKI|5.0|Nicole Kidman is at her best as Grace, a woman hiding from the mob during the depression, who hides out in a mountain township. After deals are made and friendships blossom, power corrupts and human(?) nature takes over, and things get very ugly. Even the end credits deal with man's inhumanity to his fellows. Some of the best set designs I've never seen.
068817776X|5.0|How amazing, and refreshing to read about someone who had this unmistakable courage to lived among her enemies. We can only imagine how very scary her life must have been and yet she lived to tell us her story. I'm so proud of Edith, and I'm proud to have read about her story of survival! <BR>I have to disagree with:<BR>DULL Self-absorbed Tale, October 10, 2003 <BR> Reviewer: Sharyn Gantt from Accokeek, MD USA  <BR>Seems more fiction than fact to me; at most this reads like an embellished version of something resembling the truth. <br />Seems to me we shouldn't be so quick to pass judgement on a life we never lived, true I too was not there but who am I to not trust this woman's experience. People like the above re-viewer have no place in my life.
B00000JCOV|5.0|I would just like to say that this is one of the best albums out there. Granted, you may not like it, but some things just arn't for everybody. I for one recommend this CD to anybody who has had a even a vague desire to try out Slipknot. I personally have bought this cd 5 times. Its just that good. Every track rules, all the band members and talented and each hold their own place. Best metal band since their first release (Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat.) to their not so hot, but still awesome 3rd album (iowa). The iowa nine really know how to kick it up a notch and they are not afraid to show it.

6302787297|5.0|This film is a great movie. It has to be experienced in it's original widescreen aspect ratio. Pan and Scan, just ruins it to a degree, because 1492 is a highly artistic film that needs the big picture for you to truly get it. I own an import dvd from France of this film, and it looks the way it should, perfect. One of those rare movies where Pan and Scan ruins the film, it says more about the quality of the film than anything. What we have here is a movie that takes us on a journey through time, it educates us as to what it all took for Christopher Columbus to accomplish what he did, and how he never was truly appreciated for having the courage, an idea about the planet, that the world wasn't flat, and you could sail the sea and not run into monsters guarding the edge of the world. You really have to credit Columbus for believing that the world was different, yet mysterious. The film provides us with plenty of drama, action, and character depth. Only thing that takes away a little bit is that the movie at times can be slow paced. And at the start of the movie, where Columbus says, &quot;I will not give up&quot;, the editing is awful. Other than that, no flaws to speak of. It really doesn't have any. Gerard Depardieu gives one of his finest performances making Columbus human, and adding an emotional element to the role no other actor could give. Since Depardieu is completely a unique actor. He is brilliant here as Columbus. <br />I'd say this film deserves more of a cult following. Vangelis score is superbly rich and sublime, and 1492 is a rare breed of film where the music and the scenes work with eachother to create more of an impact on the scences.<br />Better yet, Ridley Scott does one heck of a job in the directors chair, bringing the story of Columbus life to the screen, in just under three hours.<br />Shame on Paramount for not releasing this on DVD yet. They rerelease movies as special editions, but they can't release an educational, very well made movie tothe movie viewing public on DVD. What is that all about anyway. <br />1492, is best experienced in the widescreen format.
B0000AKY7R|4.0|This is a landmark CD, no doubt about it from the golden years of Santana, though surpassed in quality by Caravanserai.<br />But Armando Peraza isn't dead, unlike what this lead reviewer says.<br />He's still playin' man....<br />Matthew
B00005A46T|4.0|As I huge fan of the Knot, I was dissapointed when this first hit shelves, but after about my second time listening to it, I fell in love with it. Now sure, there are all the reviews out there saying Slipknot has no talent, but those are just people who arn't fans of the band. Why would you buy a cd if you don't like the music? If you are a fan of good metal and great vocals, pick this cd up, but no before getting their self titled album.
B00012QM8G|2.0|Disclaimer: I realize these are ONLY DVDs, shiny little discs that hold the wonder of film on them, BUT Schindler's List &quot;is an absolute good,&quot; &quot;it is life.&quot;<br />No word in any language could ever express the amount of discontent I hold towards Warner Bros. for their initial treatment of Goodfellas on DVD.  A 5-star film deserves AT LEAST 4-star treatment.  Seriously, who wants to stop halfway through a film and flip the disc over to continue their viewing pleasure?  Fortunately for Warner Bros., they are redeeming themselves by re-releasing Goodfellas in a format a film of its caliber deserves - a member of the Two Disc Special Edition set with the likes of Casablanca, Citizen Kane, and Singin in the Rain.<br />Now, Universal?  In 2004, well into the age of the DVD?  Where high quality picture, special features, and two-disc special editions reign supreme?  How could a film such as Schindler's List receive the treatment that Goodfellas (forgiving Warner Bros. a bit, they did release Goodfellas before the current DVD age) first received?  Universal has released a 5-star film during a time when DVDs are providing the film viewer, like never before, a crystal clear, specially packaged backstage pass to experience their favorite films in a 2-star set straight out of the 20th century.  The LEAST Schindler's List deserved was to have the viewer have to take a separate disc out of the package and insert it into the DVD player halfway through the film, not flip the same disc over (Geez, even the supposedly &quot;cheap&quot; distribution people over at Miramax had the respect for a film like Gangs of New York - not even in the same league as Schindler's List - to place the second half of the film on another disc).  Seriously Universal, you had quite a few years to develop this project and offer it the treatment it deserved.  It's unfortunate this wonderful film experience wasn't shown more respect and at least given two discs to share its message on.  <br />Treatments such as this were meant for &quot;flicks&quot; like Battlefield Earth and Crossroads.

B00007LTIA|3.0|Certainly this album here is a listening experience. \\"Tales From Topographic Oceans\\" is Yes's most ambitious and long winded album they ever made.  A great deal of it is not too much of a challenge to listen to (although the length is the only difficulty I have).  It's just very different; complex but not complicated.<br />  It's their least pop oriented album (that says a lot) and it's not just because of the length of the album.  Oddly enough there is an intimacy about it, more of a personal statement by Jon Anderson with the rest of the band filling in with their idea.  This is \\"Tales from Topographic Oceans\\" strength as well as its weakness.  The music feels like five solo artists making a collage of what they wanted Yes to sound like.  There are too many fragmented musical ideas floating around Jon Anderson's conceptual lyricism.  Although the music is intriguing, the songs don't seem to steam from a central melody or idea but seems more like a guitar solo here, a synth wash there, and an acoustic folk song turning into a faux african rhythm which is to say I don't entirely understand what the music is about.<br />  Not to say that this album lacks any cohesion, it's just well spread out.  I would compare it to trying to summarize the world we live in within the parameters of a five hundred word essay, interesting challenge but silly think it could be done.<br /> This was the most interesting of the Yes re-issues for me because of how dense the sound was on TFTO.  The re-mastering really brings out some nice hues that I could not identify so easily on the '92 re-mastering giving more breathing room for the different instrumentation.  The bonus tracks are interesting but not necessary.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I'm very glad for living in this century and being able to hear Christina's love-filled beautiful voice. She is an expanding virtuoso at singing, the most beautiful instrument God granted to us.... <BR>Don't blame her and her art just because you don't understand. Let's better be a little bit grateful for how much she loves us and that she shares every drop of her soul with us regardless of how vulnerable she actually is. Please respect this.<BR>'Stripped' is I think debut of the 'real' Aguilera where she's found herself. The music is ok. There are many wise ideas, also a few energy break-ups at some points. No word to her singing. Her ability at shifting between 5-6 different vocal characteristics without loosing the control in both overview and detail, is very charming. One of my favorites is 'Make Over'. Not too radical maybe but a good, oriental influenced rock song with pop sound adorned with sweet vocal figures and good distorted vocal at chorus where she uses the unique rebellious side of her voice.<BR>Her ballads have more density, 'Loving Me 4 Me' is the first one I remember. <BR>And about the other rock influenced songs like 'Fighter', 'Dirty', etc.; I believe what she's doing is real POP-ROCK (except the lack of double-time snare at the end of 'Fighter', but her drummer plays it better at live) <BR>Well, I liked almost every note I've heard from intro to outro.<BR>If you're still in doubt, I assure you,  she is not there in vain. Future is waiting to write her name into the music history. It's your choice, either buy it now, or wait for your children to get it to you one day :) Have a nice day .
B000000H5J|5.0|let me start by saying this: This Cd kicks some serious ass and is my favourite fear factory cd. It is, in my opinion one of the best metal cd's ever written. It is in the middle of their carrer, therefore combining their best: the extreme heaviness of soul of a new machine and the melodic parts of digimortal. The band sounds really tight and they stay close throughout the entire cd. This cd has bonus tracks, and theyre worth all your money. A few of the best songs are damanufacture, self bias resistor, zero signal, h-k, and pisschrist. the double bass drums on self bias resistor sounds like a helicoptor, and it has really catchy chorus. If you buy this cd, make sure you get the digipack, with the remixes and the cover of agnostic fronts your mistake. Its an awsome cd altogether, and I think every metalhead should own it
B00005J6SZ|3.0|This Album was produced by Nile Rodgers and his time was the 70s. If we listen to this album today we may think there was no technical possibilty to create quality pop music, but believe me this recording sounded \\"old\\" by the time it came out. Other weakness is that it has many monotone and repeatative song, which are boring, example: over and over, pretender, stay...By that time she worked also together with Tangerine Dream, and those songs are much better than the ones we can find here, no wonder that \\"Gambler\\" and Crazy for You\\" climbed the charts not theese ones. Her other big hit \\"Into the groove\\" is not presented here either.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|Some people complain that nothing happens in this movie, and yet in Chekov's &quot;The Three Sisters&quot;, nothing happens and it's considered a classic. In life, we don't always fight these huge battles, we don't find out that our significant others had an affair...not every day, at least. I think the beauty of this movie lies in its simplicity. It mirrors the state of the characters- they're both in directionless marriages, they've reached a standstill, so a fastpaced movie would contradict the story.<br />Before I'd seen the movie, I saw a few clips here and there and figured that Bill Murray was simply playing himself. But after watching the movie, I have much more respect for him as an actor (I've always loved him, but I love him even more now.) Because while there are moments where he seems to be playing himself, you realize (hopefully you realize) that the acting's a lot more subtle, and there's a lot more to him. It's not Bill Murray playing a guy similar to him. It's hard to explain, but... some people don't apprectiate his performance. Truly appreciate.  It's completely natural and subtle and beautiful.<br />And I felt very fulfilled by the end of the movie. I don't think movies need a clear cut THE END at the end. With few exceptions, life is never certain. And I felt that the overall message at the end, the overall feeling...was just...survival. Just to keep going. So even though they were both ultimately where they started, they had changed, maybe not in a monumental way, but internal. So even though there's no event to really say &quot;hey we got somewhere&quot;, I think that there IS closure to it, but to have a defined finality to it would kind of... defeat the purpose. It's just a very natural movie.

0930289234|5.0|first, i wish &quot;a reader from Israel&quot; (who is probably the same person writing mulitple reviews) would stop. one review is enough.<br />second, watchmen is not about superheroes, but about well rounded and convincing characters who happen to be costumed heroes. watchmen does explore the implications of being a costumed hero, but it is only one of many facets to this novel.  secondly, it is filled with cleaver imagery and various symbolism which ties into the book from beginning to end.  you'll often find yourself skimming back in the book in order to catch them.  it also makes excellent work in taking advantage of it's genre and well proves that sequential art is as valid as any other medium.<br />contrary to what &quot;a reader from Israel&quot; may say, the point of the book is not to be realistic (although i find the historical fiction of it to be very interesting).  after all, if it were totally realistic, no super-heroes would be involved. if you want realism go read a historical piece, because it's not what fiction is for.<br />finally, watchmen had several compelling, sincere, and compassionate moments which will tug at your heart-strings.<br />i'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys complicated fiction (so dont close you mind to it just because a close-minded review told you to)

Walking up Olympic Way to the Wembley Towers always made any one going to the Stadium awe at the history of the now late Wembley.<br />The sound hear is as clear as it was seeing them live and the extras helped enhance the experience of 18 years ago. Everyone there would talk to each other even though they did not know each other. Then when Queen ran on the famous Wembley roar was as loud then as it is on the DVD. An experiecen I will never forget.<br />The extras will help make any Wembley or Queen fan feel nostalgic. The Wembley Towers bit was very poignent. An earlier review said it was a waste. Well its not. In UK when the discussion arose about what to do with the towers when the new Wembley is being built caused a much heated debate, sadly they will not see the new Wembley. Its the towers which was the symbol of Wembley. Its under the towers that has seen many sporting moments. So for two patriotic Queens to show their feeligns summed up the whole country's regret that they are not staying.
0783226837|5.0|This is what you get when a cast, crew, director, and screenwriters believe in their project but don't take themselves to levels of pretension. This is good clean fun: a monster movie that doesn't require buckets of blood and an overdose of c.g.i. effects. The setting is a brilliant daytime desert instead of a fog-enshrouded gloomy night in a Victorian house whose lights suddenly fail to work. (The foggy, gloomy night in other horror movies usually has to hide a weak script and shoddy directing.)<br />The plot of TREMORS is simple and classic. Something, which is for the most part invisible, is killing off the population of a teeny hamlet one-by-one. Who will save the day? The heroes are the most unlikely of men who rise to the occasion, of course. Will two young people fall in love during the course of the adventure? Of course. Where do the monsters come from? Who knows? It doesn't matter. They're just here and have to be dealt with. Simple, classic.<br />Kevin Bacon, Fred Ward, Reba McEntie, and Michael Gross all turn in unbelieveably wonderful performances, and Ron Underwood's direction is a perfect combination of light-hearted, quick pacing and heavy-handed suspense, which is okay in a movie about giant worms sucking people underground for their snacks. This movie is great fun and has its heart in the right place.

B000053VAZ|5.0|I love this movie!<BR>It's sweet, it's sensitive, it's cute, it's funny, it's sad... it's just got it all.<br />Every woman needs a &quot;Sam&quot;. :)
6305841861|3.0|I give the the film 5 out of 5 stars. Everything that can be said about this film has been said many times over.<br />The dvd on the other hand.. I had heard good things about this dvd such as \\"excellent commentary, great transfer...\\". The picture quality seems acceptable most of the time except in the very dark scenes where it looks like there's some mosaic type effect. Never noticed that on my vhs copy or on any other dvd. It's not a big deal. 3 stars for the picture quality.<br />The commentary suffers from having 4 people yakking at once too often. 2 seperate commentary tracks would have been better. Or just Bruce and Sam. The fx guy says plenty in the doco \\"gore the merrier\\" which is also included on this dvd. Having him blabbing in the main commentary too is overkill. 2.5 stars for the commentary.<br />The extras consist of some stills, trailer (brings back some memories!) and the doco Gore the Merrier. This isn't bad as effects docos go, if you're really curious about \\"how they did that\\".. I'm not. The best part of it for me was the actress who played Linda talking about how much \\"fun\\" she had having the nude cast done of her body.
1400031354|5.0|If you have not read The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, I strongly urge you to do so before reading Tears of the Giraffe.  Otherwise, this beautiful novel will seem like a four star effort as you fail to appreciate and integrate the background of Precious Ramotswe into your thinking as it was described in the earlier book.<br />Tears of the Giraffe isn't so much a sequel as a continuation of the events in The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency.  As that book ended, Mma Ramatswe accepted the proposal of Mr J.L.B. Matekoni.  In Tears of the Giraffe, the couple decides in which of their houses they will live, picks out a ring and decides about having children.  Each event has its unexpected twists . . . including an attempt by Mr Matekoni's maid to derail the marriage.<br />There is less happening at the detective agency than in the prior story.  This book involves solving only two mysteries, a wandering wife and a missing son.  Mma Ramatswe learns that her able secretary wants to become a detective, and the savvy head of the agency tries out Mma Makutsi's talents with encouraging results.<br />Both story lines focus on questions of right and wrong.  As a prospective spouse, what are the right reactions to one's fianc&eacute; or fianc&eacute;e?  As a detective, how much may one do wrong to avoid greater wrongs?  To one's community, what is owed?  To one's employees, what opportunities should be opened?  In each case, the suggestion is that all responsibilities must be borne . . . and borne bravely . . . but in a way that is tempered with love for one's fellow people.<br />As with The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, Africa itself plays a role stronger than any single character in defining what is thought and done.  The strong and distinct atmosphere makes the book more enchanting to those who do not know Africa.<br />The story is strengthened by alternating narrators among many different characters and using lots of dialogue so that each part of the novel is vivid and varied.  It's as though six or seven almost unconnected short stories were woven together into a seamless novel.  It's an impressive accomplishment.<br />As I finished the book, I wondered how much better off we all would be if we each took a strong responsibility for all those we meet and touch.t's as though six or seven almost unconnected short stories were woven together into a seamless novel.

B00005JKJA|5.0|DO NOT read this review if you want to figure out the puzzle of Mulholland Drive on your own.   You have been warned. <br />For those who are tired of being puzzled by it, here is the explanation.  <br />One of the first shots of the movie -- right after the jitterbug credits -- is of a head falling to a pillow.  Everything that follows after that -- until the cowboy says &quot;It's time to wake up&quot; is  Diane's dream.<br />Here is what is real:  Diane Selwyn(Naomi Watts)is a struggling actress.  She became friends with Camilla Rhodes, a much more successful actress.  The two became loves, then Camilla broke it off.  Camilla gets together with Adam, her director, and at a dinner party the two announce their engagement (or perhaps they announce their pregnancy.  It's ambiguous but doesn't really matter.)  Diane is falling apart after breaking up with Camilla, and the announcement pushes her over the edge.  She hires a hit man to take out Camilla.  And then she falls asleep.  And the dream begins.  <br />Everything in the dream is some element of Diane's life rearranged so that she is the desirable one, the one in power and control.  Betty -- Diane's dream-ego -- is innocent but clever, resourceful, and talented. The cowboy represents Diane's subsconscious; he is ultimately in control of everything.  At one point he says, &quot;a man's attitude goes some ways toward how a man's life will be.&quot;  Definitely true of a dream sequence: one's attitude determines the reality of the dream.  Diane's relationship with Camilla is rewritten so that Camilla is needy and Diane can help her.  Diane's hatred of Adam is represented by her dreams' desire to strip him of power: the cowboy forces him to cast the lead role his way, while at the same time, he is oddly attracted to Betty.  The director who once told Diane she wasn't any good instead tells Betty she is amazing -- but at the same time, Betty turns him down, going instead with the casting director who will take her bigger, better places.  <br />The strange blue box is a subconscious representation of Diane's guilt over killing Camilla.  Remember that the hit man used a blue key as the sign that the hit had taken place.  <br />Teatro Silencio is both a signal from the director to the viewer and from Diane's subconscious to her conscious mind: what appears real is actually fake.<br />The scary man behind Winkie's is the truthteller, and everyone is afraid of him.  He holds the blue box that is Diane's guilt, and from it runs her innocence -- symbolized by the nice people Betty meets on the plane to LA.  Her former life.  <BR>  <BR>Diane wakes up when her subconscious (the Cowboy) tells her to.  Her neighbor comes over to collect the last of her stuff.  She sees the blue key on the table which means the hit has taken place.  But she is cracking; she also thinks she sees Camilla.  As she continues to crack, she is terrorized by the spectors of her lost innocence (the old people) until she kills herself.  <br />See?  It all makes sense.

B0001611DI|5.0|After recently buying a Korean copy of DOTD on eBay, and having it lock up in my DVD player, I was i complete anticipation of this new one.  It may not be the director's cut, but it certainly is the best version of the film I've ever seen.  Transfer is crystal clear, audio is Dolby enhanced w/surround sound if enabled, sountrack errors (like when it slices short after they shoot Wooley) are corrected...All in all, one great DVD for the die hard collector or even the first time viewer. This is the way to watch this film.  When the two-disc director's cut comes out, I'll buy that too.  This was a sweet movie.  Not necissarily the scariest movie ever made (as they advertise), but still one you watch over and over again because you like the characters.  <BR>Night of the living dead was dry, and Day of the Dead sucked.  This was the one to see.  Enjoy it
B000002MG1|5.0|Automatic for the People is, quite simply, a masterpiece. It is my first (and so far, only) REM record, but it glows with such incredible emotion and depth that it should last anyone a long time. The album features a collection of magnificent alternative rock tracks - some are slow, quiet and haunting (Drive), some are sweet and poppy (Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite), some are bittersweet and moving (Everybody Hurts, Nightswimming), and some are deep and energetic (Ignoreland). But differences aside, every song adds up to make Automatic a fabulous collection of alternative rock. The overall mood of the record is melancholy but hopeful, with many songs containing heartfelt reflections, introspections, morals, and messages. And even if you're not a big of fan of REM's standard stuff, the diversity of the album's tracks should provide a breath of fresh air, and I think there's something here for everyone.<BR> <BR>DRIVE: A slow, hautning rock track with good vocals and guitars.<BR>TRY NOT TO BREATHE: I like the pacing and tempo of this song. The vocals are very well done, especially the chorus with interrwining lyrics.        <BR>THE SIDEWINDER SLEEPS TONITE: A peppy, upbeat pop track with catchy lyrics.<BR>EVERYBODY HURTS: A quiet but deeply moving ballad with outstanding vocals and guitars<BR>NEW ORLEANS INSTRUMENTAL NO. 1: A calm, peaceful instrumental track     <BR>SWEETNESS FOLLOWS: Another slow track with great background guitars and good vocals<BR>MONTY GOT A RAW DEAL: I love this song. The drums are awesome, the guitar riff in the chorus is very well done, and the vocals are heartfelt.<BR>IGNORELAND: A politically-charged emotional chant by Michael Stipe. I think it's a nice foil to the bevy of slow songs in the record, and the song is very energizing and meaningful.<BR>STAR ME KITTEN: Slow and brooding, with relaxing guitars and vocals.<BR>MAN ON THE MOON: An excellent alternative rock track with memorable lyrics and great guitar work.<BR>NIGHTSWIMMING: I remember hearing this song on the radio when I was about 5. It's a magnificent song with a very moving, melancholy sound and fantastic strings.<BR>FIND THE RIVER: A calming, upbeat closer with more talented vocals.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|As much as the action may grab viewers in, this finale to the Matrix series DOES NOT deliver on a plot based level.  Its as if the Hero's journey is turned on its head and instead of a victorious triumphant ending, the Wachowski brothers gave us a big fat Zerbert, just so that they could be \\"Original\\"  Neo, with all his powers and abilities is turned into nothing more than a sacrificial lamb, but not for a VICTORY, but for coexistance or appeasement.  Both Neo & Trinity's sacrifices for the survival of humanity do nothing more than evidently delay the inevitable, as the \\"Architect\\" does not believe it will last.  This wishy washy ending left me and fellow movie goers in the premiere of this movie disappointed and wondering if the Wachowski brothers were clicking on all cylinders when the chose this ending.  While, I will purchase this movie only because I own the other two as well as the Animatrix & the video game, REVOLUTIONS could have been A LOT better.  PEOPLE WANT A HAPPY VICTORIOUS ENDING, man was already oppressed by the machines in the original Matrix movie.  This movie led many to believe that w/ the aid of Neo, MAN WOULD WIN AGAINST MACHINE, not the wishy washy, lets have peace & coexist garbage. After all that the machines did to not only try to wipe out what was left of humanity, but to also grow them to use as a power source, how could man peacefully coexist with them?! What if the Rebellion , instead of destroying the 2nd Death Star & defeating the Empire, had struck up a peace treaty with the Empire in STAR WARS, or what if the free peoples of Middle Earth let Sauron take over their lands & gain ultimate power & put them into eternal fear and slavery so that they could merely exist in the Lord of the Rings?  If that had been the case neither of these grand sagas would hold so strongly in the hearts of people everywhere.  While I would give the series overall at the most 3 stars, I give Matrix Revolutions only 1.  The Matrix series, because of its strange second chapter and defeatest final chapter will not stand the test of time that the Lord of the Rings or Star Wars will.  Its too bad, because it had the potential to.

B000005HLV|4.0|With the murder of Mayhem's guitarist Euronymous (by Burzum mastermind Varg Vickernes, a session bassist on this album), the suicide of the ironically named vocalist Dead before the recording of this album, the Satanic and Pagan (as if the two somehow go together) beliefs of the band members and any other source of controversy that I haven't covered, Mayhem are certainly a well-known band in the black metal genre. Their antics are arguably more well-known and definately more widely discussed than their music. Because of this, one could be forgiven for being rather sceptical about them - are they famous for being one of the greats or are they famous because one of them made a necklace out of the other one's brains?<br />Well, De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas is certainly no wet lettuce. For anyone to listen to this and say that its nothing more than hype is simply wrong, since there's a lot of good stuff going on here. While the guitar parts are very simple, there is an atmosphere here that is very hard to describe, while the speed driven drums add pure intensity into the mix. Euronymous may not be able to shred it up, but he often does some slower solos here when its time for the band to stop blasting along like the Eurostar, and he does a good job.<br /><br />However, to say that the music here is incredible would be a lie. Much of the time it is simply blast blast blast, and contrary to popular belief there is more to black metal than that. There the occasional slower passages (not quiet passages, mind), but most of the time this band is plagued by a need for speed. This wouldn't be a problem if they were a technical death metal band, but they're not. Fast heavy music gets boring quickly when its this simple. Also, I'm going to have to agree with those who don't like Atilla. At times he can actually be quite good, but he almost seems microphone shy, as if he doesn't want to really let rip. The result is a cross between a teenager's voice breaking and a wet fart most of the time, which unsurprisingly detracts from the overall feel of the album and even sounds like a black metal parody.<br />It has to be said that musically, this album has since been bettered. Other bands have been more inventive, more atmospheric, more technically adept, more emotional and/or more professional. There's no question that this album is legendary in it's own right, but despite its reputation I'd have to recommend that you save it for when you're already into black metal. 4 stars nonetheless, but if you think this is all black metal has to offer then you're missing out on some much more creative music.time, which unsurprisingly detracts from the overall feel of the album and even sounds like a black metal parody.<br />It has to be said that musically, this album has since been bettered.

B000002UYZ|4.0|The first disc is simply great.  The second disc starts off strong, but ends with a mere shadow of the greatness of disc one, because the final tracks (with the exception of the wonderful Paperback Writer) are weak songs from Rubber Soul and Revolver. Overall, a good sampler of the early years.
B00008PW2D|5.0|This show is so smart and sexy, I really don't care about the price. All that matters to me is the entertainment value -- and that is superb.  SATC is to fiction what the \\"New Sex Now\\" dvd is to non-fiction; once you discover it, your life can and will never be the same.
B000001Y2U|2.0|This is the record that launched Marilyn Manson into stardom in the mid-nineties. On a graphical level, it offers some powerful and disturbing (at least when it came out) imagery, and the lyrical content sets up a couple of interesting ideas for a conceptual album about individuality, evolution, adaptation and society. It settles an addictive dark mood, mixing rock, techno, metal and electronica and offering well-accomplished moments like the hymn &quot;The Beautiful People&quot;, the gothic &quot;Tourniquet&quot; or the unsettling and superbly crafted &quot;Cryptorchild&quot;. However, the second half of the record is too noisy, long and repetitive, turning into a loud and unengaging sound explosion that ends up seeming bland and uninspired. Nine Inch Nails` Trent Reznor gives a hand producing the album, but not even that can turn this into an above average effort. &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; is a flawed release with some intriguing songs and atmospheres, yet Manson`s better work would be its follow-up, the techno/glam-oriented &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot;. <BR>Worth listening but not a keeper.

B000001FI7|3.0|Hailed as one of the key trip-hop albums, Portishead`s debut is an interesting and gripping effort but as a whole it`s not really a standout or a masterpiece. It wisely creates a dark, unsettling and haunting atmosphere, and in some moments it truly becomes hypnotically nightmarish. In that regard, it`s an effective piece of music, offering captivating moods and ambiances. However, as a whole it`s a way too depressing listening experience and its sound isn`t as ecclectic as it should. Beth Gibbons` vocals are impressive and adequate to the overall nocturnal, film-noirish feel, even if she sounds a bit melodramatic at parts. There are a couple of great songs here, though, &quot;Mysterons&quot;, &quot;Strangers&quot; and &quot;Roads&quot; being the highlights. <BR>A worthwile achievement, yet not as dazzling as some claim.
B00006J9OV|5.0|Some years back,a popular PBS crime series &quot;Inspector Morse&quot; ended. The inspector in question was a lover of opera and classical music. He suffered a sudden fatal heart attack. As he lay at peace in the hospital bed, the opening bars of the prelude to Wagner's Parsifal played. Momentarily,I was transcended. This ethereal music always has this effect on me.<BR>     I find only 2 problems with the acting in this drama. Vocally,the production is a masterpiece. Waltraud Mier's Kundry wasn't wild enough and Franz Mazura's Klingsor wasn't menacing enough.That said,on to the good stuff!<BR>     The great Kurt Moll as Gurnemanz is the standout here.His voice is so perfect and beautiful.I wish he had recorded a Wotan.<BR>He is a fantastic Sarastro in DG &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;.<BR>      ActIII is the one I most enjoyed. The healing of Amfortas and the ascension of the former &quot;fool&quot; Parsifal to power were breathtaking. With Wagner,it's so much more about the music than the vocals. This music is glorious. The Met Opera orchestra deserves special thanks for this tremendous achievement.
B00005JLSE|2.0|Frankly, I still have to discover why is this movie so overrated...Sure, the production values are good, the songs are appropriate, the acting is decent and it has some neat visual moments. Yet, it doesn`t really work as a solid, consistent film, just a bunch of stylish scenes with an almost nonexistent plot. And the characters, where are them?! What I saw was just a collection of cardboard, one-dimensional charicatures that couldn`t get my interest. Since I don`t really like musicals all that much, maybe I`m a bit biased here. Still, it is not a great movie, it brings nothing new and doesn`t deserve all the praise it got. Even as simple entertainment it`s average at best. <BR>Pure eye candy, easy on the eyes but vapid and forgettable.
0743243307|2.0|Life in Brick Lane is captured with an uncanny, almost photographic realism. And the story of Nanzeen and Chanu's life together rings true. Yet the pace is maddeningly slow and the plot disintegrates into predictability. That said, I believe that Monica Ali is a writer who has been blessed with great talent. Unfortunately, Brick Lane is not a great novel.
