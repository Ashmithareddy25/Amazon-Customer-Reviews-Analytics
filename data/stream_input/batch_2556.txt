B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is fun. Pet horse on the go! Even though you have to be patient sometimes its better than nothing
1419705849|5.0|A good read for anyone who loves the Diary of a Whimpy Kid Series. He truly IS a third wheel... Good book!<br />Book: 5 stars<br />Shipping: 5 stars<br />Condition: 5 stars<br />Expectations Met: 5 stars
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Another great addition from Zepto Labs. Pudding Monsters is a fun twist on classic videro slyding games.  Reminds me of the puzzles in a lot of ice levels in adventure puzzle games like Zelda for example.
B005OLF6BI|5.0|Love, Love, Love this: This product is a absolute must if you want to feel like you are at one of Taylor Swifts concerts! Being at one of Taylor's concerts, but having the comforts of being in your own home...What gets better than that?  Her talent is beyond belief in the DVD...Amazing talent! We have watch this DVD and listened to the CD countless times and have not tired from them. Definately worth the money! This order arived in a timely manner & in excellent condition. If I could, I would rated higher than 5 stars
B005544TRQ|5.0|it reminded profit but with a good guy. the young fake lawyer actor is OK at the beginning but it's get better at the  end.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|Awesome movie with outstanding special effects. This movie has science fiction alien robots.  Shipment was outstanding with arrival date being before date promised!
B00B7G3OUO|5.0|Loved every minute of it. The animation was fantastic and it kept true to the essence of the graphic novel. Let's not forget that Superman was bad ass too.
B0083SBMBM|3.0|This movie is not as good as what I thought it was going to be. It's an okay movie. Five super heros try to defeat an alien race that is trying to invade the Earth.  3 stars for the movie. However, the delivery is 5 star worthy...It was delivered before date promised and in excellent condition.
B00ARF92HK|5.0|Gangsta!! Visually stunning! This is the true interpretation of the Dredd comic book character not that comical looking 1995 Sylvester Stallone crap. A must see in my opinion.
014241493X|5.0|Can't go wrong with John Green as the author! Very good book. Well written.<br />The delivery of my order met my expectations. It arrived before the date promised and in excellent condition.<br />5 stars definately.
B000UZNRS2|5.0|Thank you for another page turner. The characters are so real it was like watching the news. Can't wait to start the next book. Pattie
B002BIULQ2|3.0|This movie...Hannah Montana: The Movie is okay. I much more enjoyed watching Miley Cyrus in her TV series \\" Hannah Montanh\\" than in this movie. I think there was better acting to be seen by her with her TV series.  Just my opinion of course. However, I was very pleased with the condition that my order arrived and the time that it took to ship it to me.<br />Hannah Montana, The Movie: 3 stars.<br />Product Condition & Shipment Time: 5 stars!<br />Customer Service: 5 stars!
B009NY43NY|5.0|I love the way this series ended! I hate that I will no longer get to follow sookies adventures but if it had to end I am glad it was this way.  True Blood is good but pales in comparison to the well developed novels and the story line in the book is so much truer to the characters that Ms. Harris created.
0525478817|5.0|Can't go wrong with John Green as the author.  This is an awesome book; written about Indiana (the Castleton area).<br />Book: 5 stars (I'd give higher if I could). This book arrived in excellent condition and before date promised.
B001CC7PR6|2.0|I have seen this movie on cable several times and it is a great war film.  This version, however, was of poor quality with flashing lights in the background.
0316017930|3.0|This book is okay.  It's about people who started out with nothing and ended up making a name for themselves. It starts SLOW and stays SLOW throughout. It's written well in the sense of telling peoples lifes stories, but it doesn't pick up speed. It goes from person-to-person-to-person in the same monatone. Almost like putting together a puzzle. Very SLOW written storyline.<br />Book: 3 stars<br />Shipping: 5 stars<br />Condition: 5 stars
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|Saw this movie in theaters, and had to have it. Great sound, especially if you have surround sound!!  Chevelle chase scene in surround sound is amazing!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|If you enjoy logic puzzles, you're going to love The Room. Basically, it's a puzzle box that increases in size and puzzles as it levels up. It has a good storyline and there are hints if you get stuck. The graphics are awesome. I'm looking forward to the sequel!
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Always loved this show.  Peter Faulk was born for the role of Columbo.  The boxed CD set is of good quality.
B00992CF6W|5.0|0.6.0 great but im tired of seeing 0.7.0 and 0.7.1 youtube videos saying the update came well not for me :( :)
B004EF65QA|5.0|Margaret is a most worthy woman who had the foresight to pick and choose her partner for life.  The film was very close to the book and only strayed in the un-essentials.  Great casting and intrigue!
B002PEP4SC|5.0|Enjoyed this book.. Really like the TV show.. Now I've starting reading the books.. 1st book down more to go..
B008JJM88Q|3.0|Its was ok, not that interesting, after a few games deleted, do not recommend for those that are bored easily.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game isn't action packed or anything like that, but it is a brain game.  Some levels are difficult, some are not.  It's an enjoyable little game though.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Very well made, but gets kind of boring after a while. Still, not at all glitchy and takes very little time to load. The controls are so simple even a five year old could play it. Four stars.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I downloaded this for free thankfully, because I don't get why everyone loves this game.  Unless I'm missing something, it's pretty boring.
B008KP6ENE|1.0|I've yet to understand why developers don't provide a means to clearly and cleanly exit an app. Do they think trapping customers into the game will have them play longer? Do they think it will generate a better review? My response: Uninstall.
B00BBQXUYK|5.0|I love animation and this movie offers.  The story line is great as well, but I wonder about having children see it who haven't questioned the existence of Santa and others.  Just be careful when watching with the little ones!  Story line is beautiful and well done in video form.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|It fits right in the leatherman sheath and put a decent edge on knife.  It is also tough enough to live through my abuse
044024613X|2.0|I am struggling getting into this book.  Have found myself skipping ahead to see if it is worth reading.  May give up on it.
B00CFQMVLS|5.0|I don't understand people who go to see a Die Hard movie and then complain it is a Die Hard movie!  Action, funny quips, relationship drama; that is a Die Hard movie.  I like this one as well as the first two, I thought it gave a pretty realistic look at what John's relationship with his family would be like at this age.  Wonderful acting, great dialog, fantastic action scenes, some great plot twists.  If you like that type of movie, you will love this one.
B0081336FO|3.0|Sherlock was a little to dramatic and hard to understand at times but overall it was a good and interesting show
B002ZG99A4|5.0|Another great movie for the guys.  Keep them entertained.  I actually liked it too, not really into the blow them up movies.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|The case is lightweight and gets the job done with little bulk. I love the case and am very happy with the purchase.
B0085OELXK|1.0|I didn't care for the film.  It dragged on and on and in the end, Damon's character turned out to be a serial killer.  The film unexpectedly went from being enjoyable to dark.  Maybe I should have read other reviews of it...my expectations were completely wrong from what the film was about.
B005T87QCI|5.0|Better than any other real boxing game<br />Real Steel is my girlfriends Favorite game<br />Deserves 10 out of 10<br />Axelrod and Danger zone are good
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|I had high hopes for this one based on the cast, but the story seemed to just creep along.  One of those movies you keep waiting for it to ramp up and get you involved.  Alas, I fell asleep.  My wife told me it never did speed up.
B00AQM8H9I|2.0|I was intrigued by the cute animations but after playing about 1-2 games, it got to be very boring.  Maybe good for children!
B0009MDPYW|4.0|I saw this movie several weeks before I wrote this, but I remember I liked the movie.  I like movies that have subtle twists in the plot.  The movies I like are not cookie cutter predictable and they have a good story line that keeps your attention.  Worth a watch.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is very creative and fun.  It is challenging enough without being so hard that it's discouraging.  I highly recommend it for people who like puzzles.<br />Goddessliz
B0037VNX44|5.0|You'd have to be a movie aficionado to truly appreciate how accurately Charles Bronson is depicted in this film. The movie does seem to drag in some areas and the quality is somewhat grainy, but it adds to the aesthetics of the film perfectly!
B005NS0VNU|5.0|REM's been my fave band my whole life, so like any other band, the greatest hits turns out the best!<br />This was even the most special greatest hits I've ever seen because they talk so personally about every song, their personal opinions about it, what was going on in their life at the time, etc. It's awesome!! -40 songs!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I unexpectedly liked this movie.  Yes, some things were never in the book but that's what happens.  There is a lot of traveling in the book. How boring would that be in the movie.  Rhadagast was spoke of in the book a time or maybe two.  I liked the characters I think they were well fitted for their parts.  I was reluctant to see this movie but I was glad I did.  Now I own it.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|This app is really cute and kind of has the feel of Little Big Planet. Very enjoyable. NOW, if only we could get an app that plays like Pandoras Box. Developers where are you. Pandoras Box for the win.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Who wasn't a fan of the eagles in the 70's. So many great memorable songs! Love Don Henley and Glenn Frey! I will never get tired of hearing their songs.
B009NY43NY|5.0|This book was a great end to a great series. What I love about the series is the humor, southern charm, mystery and the brilliant twists Ms.Harris puts on old stories (ex. technology advanced enough to create True Blood, enabling vampires to 'come out of the coffin').<br /><br />I sent Ms.Harris a note...<br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD!<br /><br />Dear Ms. Charlaine Harris,<br /><br />My heart hurt for you when I read the Wall Street Journal article, 'How to Kill a Vampire (Series)' from May 2, 2013.<br /><br />(http://on.wsj.com/107k6G5)<br /><br />I'm very sad to read that there are such twisted people in this world that would attack you with death threats because they disliked the way you ended the Sookie Stackhouse series.<br /><br />I'm guessing most of these strange people were vampire fanatics. Don't get me wrong, I love Eric and Bill, but it was clear that they were not the right mate for Sookie. I don't understand how anyone could have missed this. Sookie did not trust either of them, she suspected Eric killed Kym Rowe and that he would leave her when she got old. And Eric was thinking of turning Sookie against her will.  Sookie would never be able to trust Bill again after she learned that he seduced her on a queen's orders.  Sookie says, more than a few times, that she does not want to become a vampire. She loves the sun, she wants children. She also doesn't want to leave Bon Temps, her family and friends.<br /><br />I'm really glad you stuck with your vision for the series. I just finished Dead Ever After, it was great and ended pretty much the way I expected. It seemed clear to me, early in the series, that Sookie would end up with Sam, but more importantly that she would evolve into someone that could take care of herself.<br /><br />What I love about the series is the humor, southern charm, mystery and the brilliant twists you put on old stories (ex. technology advanced enough to create True Blood, enabling vampires to 'come out of the coffin').<br /><br />I'm looking forward to Midnight Crossroad and I love the anthologies you do with Toni L. P. Kelner. I love True Blood too, but it is nothing like your series anymore, but great man candy ; P<br />Thank you so much for the Sookie Stackhouse series and all the great stories you write!
B007LGPSX0|5.0|This show is wonderful! Dylan and Brenda are my favorites! I love Kelly Taylor too. Great family show! deals with everyday issues
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I like this app very much it is informative and easy to use. It lets you know how much power is left and roughly how long it will last give or take. As well it lets you know to what type of power source you are charging from.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|The first season is really  laying the foundation of the fringe mythology. The first season  finale is  when you really get the reveal of the story arc that will carry the show until the end of the fourth season.
B005WYFLNU|5.0|I bought these for my 5 year old niece for her birthday and she loves them.  The stickers are super thick and durable and she can use them again and again on the multiple pages.  This sticker pad has gotten a lot of use and is holding up well.  Another great Melissa & Doug product.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|Bossypants has some true moments of genius, particularly Fey's vivid descriptions of her father, her life philosophy from improv, and her prayer for her daughter. The sections that shine come across as truly honest and heartfelt. These moments of brilliance are memorable and thought-provoking.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I agree with other reviewers who observed that many passages of this book read as if they were forced or written reluctantly. To her credit, Fey does admit that she has a more stoic or private side to her. That is completely understandable, but I think it would have been stronger if she had really delved deeper into the elements that she HAD chosen to share.<br /><br />That being said, I still think it deserves 3 stars because the moments of brilliance are so worth it and special, but I can't give it more because it was so uneven.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This is a wonderful story.  I did have to put the movie out of my mind as I read the book because of the differences, such as the Good Witch being a little old woman instead of a young beautiful woman. Still, I loved it. The story is simple (good vs evil) and well told. The characters are charming and you come to care about them. I recommend this to any child who hasn't read it, any adult who didn't read it as a child and any adult who hasn't read it since being a child. You won't be sorry.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book , what a surprise....lots of twists , catches you right away and keeps you wanting to read on, even when you should be going to bed.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Excellent show! Fantastic acting, phenomenal plot. Overall great show. Keeps you in suspense and entertained throughout. Couldn't wait to watch the next episode!!!!
B003G4W49C|4.0|This book came highly recommended to me.  I liked it but the fact that children were the warriors made me uneasy.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|This was a very simple okay read.  The plot is redundant and gets old.  If your looking for a fast, easy book to teak for simple escape this book will do.
B000VSAEYI|5.0|Great pool! Bought for my sons 2nd bday party and it was perfect. No holes like previous reviews said. Great deal for the money!
B007KQ6XYY|1.0|just not the kind of game that I like too play. It looked interesting but was not a good choice for me.A lot of others may like this game so worth the try especially if still a free offer.
B0063M22QO|4.0|You think it's easy at first but, the further you get, the harder it gets.  Some tiles look alike but have suttle differences.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Not too hard, and not too easy. Lots of levels to keep you busy. Action is fast and the<br />graphics are beautiful.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|looking for a great book to read? Hunger Games takes you to an amazing world full of action, death, love, lies and much more! it is so well written that you don't want to stop reading. The three books are linked beautifully.
B0090KZDSK|3.0|It took so long between reads that I wasn't as into it as I would have been if I had read it together with the other two. I was able to put the book down several times over a period of days because trying to remember pieces from previous books was just annoying me. The book was written well BUT, since its dragging, I'd love to hear H thoughts a views every once in a while. Aside from,I would have given this 5 stars...
B009NY43NY|3.0|I had a guilty enjoyment reading this series, after my wife got hooked on it. The characters are interesting, the plot twists were enjoyable, and there was a lot of fun.  Simple pleasures, though it dealt with some serious issues and graphic violence, it often felt like young adult reading level stuff.<br /><br />This final novel in the series draws things together without wrapping things up completely, leaving the opportunity to make the future up for yourself, or even the possibility of an eventual return.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|As many, I pre-ordered this book. It is the first book I've ever returned. Trust me, if it had been a little cheaper, I may not have done so. The first two took me about a day each. This one took me 5. I just kept putting it down to do other things. It was boring. I actually thought it might get good toward the end and it didn't. It just stopped. Yes, there were a lot of steamy scenes, but you can get books with that for free.  I will definitely be waiting to hear reviews on #4 before I pay any kind of money to read it. My suggestion is wait for the next one, and just read a summary of this one to save you some time. I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because it is still better than some of the free ones I've gotten and couldn't bring myself to finish. Good writing, good editing, but I need a little conflict and substance to keep my attention.
1451627297|5.0|I am not a horror fan and, in fact, this is the first Stephen King novel I've ever read.  I am, however, a big fan of historical fiction and literary thrillers, and 11/22/63 fits comfortably within both those genres.  The intimidating thickness of the book meant nothing.  Very shortly in, I was dreading finishing --- just too much fun turning the pages.  It is a time travel story and I've read many, including the best as King acknowledges in an afterward,[[ASIN:0684801051 Time and Again]] (which my Mom made me read decades ago (thanks Mom!)), but King actually brings some fresh twists (at least to me) of the interaction between past and present.  Although I did not find the ultimate vision on this revealed at the end especially compelling, the time travel aspects were compelling throughout the story.<br /><br />Also great were the historical fiction aspects.  It is hard to think of the the start of the 1960's as \\"history,\\" (after all, I was already born!), but it is, and King brings many aspects of that time vividly to life with a balance of nostalgia for the simpler times and a clear recognition of how troubled they were, racially, environmentally, and in many other ways.  Although his picture is warmer than my own would be, it is fun, interesting and, if your old enough, a wonderfully evocative portrayal.<br /><br />Finally, and fundamentally, King can write and, amazingly, has not reached the bottom of his creative well.  This is a great story told by a master storyteller.  Enjoy.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|The Misremembered Man is a charming book that reminded me of the comfort of a warm cup of tea on a cold afternoon. Jamie and Lydia, the main characters, come alive with marvelous dialogue and sincere emotions. The horrors of Jamie's childhood are sometimes difficult to read, but add to the impact of the story. Lydia's heartfelt grief touched my heart.  I sincerely cared about these people as I read the book.  The story was extremely engaging. The flashbacks to Jamie's childhood added drama to the present events. This is simply a great book. I am looking forward to more novels by Christina McKenna.
B00BAYLQI0|4.0|My heart goes out to those who lost so much when the tsunami hit. Amazing what mother nature is capable of. Makes us seem so insignificant at times.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is the best PBS show ever written.  I'm am thoroughly enjoying it.  I hope this show is never cancelled :)
0061433047|5.0|with I shall wear midnight, a diskworld novel,  Terry Pratchett continues to entertain, explore and expand the mythos of his disk world universe while making it highly personable in the guise of his lead character.  She is hardheaded, old before her time, thoughtful, kind, highly responsible and strangely enough somehow believable despite all of that!  If you've enjoyed any of the novels concerning the witches in disk world, this is a must read.  I highly recommend it.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Disturbing premise, similar to Lord of the Flies and 1984, but enjoyed how the protagonist refused to play by the rules and ultimately changed the rules.
B00CL68NOG|3.0|Hmmm, I wasn't expecting much and my expectations were met. It wasn't bad, it had a few laughs, and had a heart, but nothing &#34;hilarious&#34; about it at all. A good time passer. I enjoyed Steissand's and Rogan's chemistry. It was just very predictable.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I know there is a new chapter called rise and swine with suction wheels and punching gloves, but it won't let me update the game.
B00267QOEQ|3.0|The first time I saw this movie I was sober and it sucked, around a year later I watched it totally baked and it was hilarious. So if your going to watch this do it stoned.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|My 5yo son watched this somewhere and kept talking about it so I got it for him but he's watched it once and now says that its for girls lol
B00402FGEE|5.0|The first crime is that the second season of SGU has STILL not been released on blu-ray, now over 2 years since the series ended.  I just finished watching this season one blu-ray set, and it is OUTSTANDING.  I'd watched the original run on SyFy HD on satellite, and had thought it looked pretty good.  But seeing it in blu-ray was unreal.  It just looked amazing.  Biggest difference I've ever seen between a show on blu-ray versus watching it in HD on sat/cable.  I believe it's because the overall look of the series was so dark; they've boarded an ancient ship, and the show designers were going for a \\"Jules Verne\\" kind of look to all the sets.  So given how dark some of the sets were, the details just didn't come out on a regular HD channel.  But watching it in blu-ray, where you're seeing exactly what the show producers intended in pristine digital form, all of those details just come alive.  (The true test of HD picture quality, by the way, is how well the TV handles black levels.  So the better the HDTV, the better a disc like these will work.)<br /><br />And it's not just the set shots either.  The special effects in the show just look amazing.  I'd always thought the new Battlestar Galactica set the standard for modern HD special effects, but honestly the ones here in SGU look better.  The shots where the \\"Destiny\\" whips through the atmosphere of a gas giant, or dives towards the surface of a star to reenergize itself, or the shots of it leaving a galaxy, are just incredible.  Seeing it on blu-ray, I could tell they must have used real Hubble telescope shots for some of these effects.  The detail is just amazing.  What really drove this home for me, is that I still had some of these episodes on my DirecTV DVR recorded off the SyFy HD channel.  So I was able to immediately compare the two.  The blu-ray just blew the DirecTV picture away.  Those shots of Destiny leaving the galaxy were phenomenal on blu-ray, just ho-hum on SyFy HD through DirecTV.<br /><br />And this blu-ray presentation really makes you appreciate what a beautiful ship design the Destiny is.  Probably one of the best looking ships in any scifi TV series ever.  The blu-ray has some great extras, and even the disc's main menu sequence just looks awesome, as it slowing works through the ship, ending up in the \\"observation room\\".<br /><br />The SECOND crime is that this series was cancelled after two seasons.  I watched it all through from the beginning during the original SyFy run, and was one of those who was pretty unhappy with the first season.  I thought there was too much conflict between these characters, making it feel more contrived than realistic.  But watching the first season straight through in a week (a little binge watching...), left me with a totally different impression.  My change in opinion started with the 3-part pilot; the blu-ray has an expanded version, which helps fill in some of the backstories setting up the conflict.  And watching it straight through makes the first season more like a flowing novel, because it really is just one long story.  This time, the conflict felt much more justified, given the backgrounds of these characters and the situation they've been thrust into.  Which meant the storyline was just much more engaging.<br /><br />So my opinion of the first season went from a \\"B-\\" to a solid \\"A\\" on this second viewing.  BUT, it was in the second season where SGU really earned its scifi cred.  That's when they started doing great, hardcore scifi that is so lacking in television and movies these days.  Having now seen the first season on this blu-ray, and about to start watching the second archived on my DVR, I'm now even more disappointed that whoever is in charge (SyFy, MGM?) still refuses to release the season 2 blu-ray.<br /><br />Clearly one reason SGU got cancelled was that it was so expensive to make.  Well, that money is all on the screen, both in terms of set design, visuals, script quality, directing, and acting.  Robert Carlyle's performance as Dr. Rush alone elevates this series above 95% of the acting in television.  If no network can put this kind of money into a scifi series and make it work, well, you'd better at least get the season 1 blu-ray, because we might never see any scifi of this quality on television again.<br /><br />Unfortunately one reason the ratings were low, was that the traditional Stargate fans wouldn't get on board with such a dark series.  Especially after SG-1 and Atlantis, which were admittedly good scifi, but were pretty light fare.  And yes, from a story perspective, SGU can get pretty grim.  Maybe they focused just a bit too much on sacrifice and loss in the first season.  But that's what the story dictated.  Once the actual mission of the Destiny is revealed in season 2 (I won't give it away here), you'll see that this was a completely original and gripping idea, and the story they could've told over another few seasons could've made it the best scifi ever on television.  If the fans of the original Stargate could've just given it a chance, and not just wanted a repeat of the same things they'd seen before, SGU might've survived.  But as it is, SGU will stand as one of the scifi series with massive potential, whose cancellation was truly criminal.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Cute movie we saw in the theater first.  My 5 year old likes it and watches it occasionally.  Good lesson for kids if you don't take it too seriously
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|And now I have to stop myself from watching too many at one time: just like &#34;Justified&#34; and &#34;The Good Wife&#34;, this is a very good show. The characters here are flawed and don't always allow justice to work but rather force it's hand whenever needed. Give it a try and by the way, it took me a few of the episodes to really get into it.........
B005F3XV7Q|4.0|Its a cute movie but gets a bit annoying at times.  My 5 year old loves it on and off - he will watch it repeatedly for weeks sometimes
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is the most epic block game I have ever played. These other game developers have tried copying this game, but Minecraft Pocket Edition is one of a kind imaginative fun that nobody finds anywhere else. I have the update on Aneroid and our Ipod. PLEASE AMAZON!!!!! NOTICE THE UPDATE!!!!!!!!!!!<br />Don't worry it'll come out. The update has all sorts of new things like buckets, CAKE and spawn eggs. Chickens can also make eggs.<br />You won't know how good this game is until you try it, so buy whenever. It's totally worth it!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book.  I became so addicted to this book.  I kept wanted to know what would happen next.  It is a great love story.  Would recommend to everyone who loves romance.
B006LSZECO|1.0|How did this book have almost 11,000 readers writing reviews and garnering more than 3 stars? One must conclude that a lot of money was spent by author and publisher and publicist to drum up sales. Awful book about awful people and truly awful final third that comes out of nowhere. I can just hear her publisher saying &#34;wrap it up fast, girl - doesn't matter if it makes no sense - let's advertise, advertise, advertise&#34;.
B0084670FU|1.0|Babel , the name of the molvie tells the story! It toataly sucked , a comlete wast of time ! acting was also poor . PURE CRAP!!!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I am completely disappointed by the ending. I feel a little lack of enthusiasm over a book full of one ridiculous drama after another with no real rhyme or reason for the events. I certainly did not feel the same after her other book, I was left wanting more but after this one I think my Gideon and Eva journey is over because there is no reason to continue with such a lack luster story and ending as this one.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Love this show!  Love to see what it is like in the English gentry.  Maggie Smith as the Dowager Duchess is absolutely delightful.
0307456633|4.0|Funny book.  Detective is a big lady with a small car traveling about in Africa.  A little romance sprinkled in.
B00821OX98|5.0|it was really good, I cant wait to see the next season,hope to see the same cast in the next one.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Funny book felt like Tina Fey was talking directly to me!  Highly recommend this book for a lazy summer afternoon.
B00BESIKWM|4.0|It had a few moments that sucks your breath away, and keeps You on the edge of Your seat, but some of the effects were predictable after the first one.  The first one made Me very glad that I was not married too, and sleeping next to the writer of  such a demented  yet awesome movie.
B0058DRUV6|3.0|This book should certainly make it onto your management reading list, don't let the three stars fool you.<br /><br />That said, Collins' \\"Good to Great\\" is choc full of the phrases that make management and self-help books sell. While the ideas behind \\"Hedgehog concepts\\" and the distinction between \\"fly-wheels\\" and \\"doom-loops\\" are useful concepts, much of the book seems like it is spent glorying in the fact that it was the author's team that discovered or invented such things. The reader is constantly reminded exactly how rigorous the scientific study of management they undertook was, and much monumental effort was required to distill these nuggets of wisdom.<br /><br />The concepts are useful. An understanding of them and how they work in the business world is a useful thing to have, if for nothing other than a frame of reference when comparing actions and motivations of your company. The book is undoubtedly popular, and you may find the phrases contained therein coming up from time to time in your work life - needless to say, if you can chime in with an intelligent and illuminating response, having understood them before, it will be beneficial to all present. The author takes the time to draw parallels between concepts that are not necessarily immediately obvious, and, as an individual who has spent much of his time studying the subject, is a good guide to some of the issues.<br /><br />The concepts in the book are good. The borderline preening as the author remarks multiple times just how many important people he has interviewed and the shameless plugs for his other works (an entire chapter is devoted to telling the reader about one of them) is not.  The book is also obnoxious if you are not a fan of catch phrases: this book has a lot of them and it pounds them home with the repetitive monotony of someone who has been teaching the same subject for just long enough to believe everything he says is true.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I like this app very much because I do not have to keep starting and stopping my games or other activities to check on the battery and the level of power.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Perfect for the free app of the day. More accurate than the normal battery indicator. Has some neat extras too.
B0085YOD1A|3.0|It's got a lot of good options. Tells about the temperature of your kindle, if it's in good health,etc. Could be better though, like it could say how to improve your kindle 's health.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Wow all I can see is blocks the texture pack is not the best hut I love building mansions and mining and fixing but nothing beats fighting mobs (spiders,zombies,creeper, and skeletons) I hate them so it is soooooooooooo fun.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|Good but not fresh storyline. As always Tom Cruise was awesome.  You should only watch this movie in a theatrical environment.
B009NY43NY|1.0|For 10+ years many have been caught up in the tales of Sookie Stackhouse, the telepathic waitress who was born with an \\"essential spark\\", destined to \\"experience and accomplish great things\\".  Dead Ever After is the highly anticipated ending to this series..... and it fizzled out.<br /><br />DEA is a hodgepodge of our beloved characters acting OUT of character laden with token curtain calls for minor players awkwardly crammed into scenes.  I disliked the beginning.  I suffered through the middle.  By the final page, I was just glad to be done. For me, each chapter felt forced and stilted.  Where was the spunky, witty Sookie?  Where was the caustic-but-lovable Pam?  Where was the zest-for-life Eric?  One by one Ms. Harris redefined these beloved characters as shallow, cold, and selfish.  I found myself longing for Bill's irritating declarations of his unrequited love for Sookie - anything to remind me of the Sookie World Ms. Harris left behind.<br /><br /> *WARNING - SPOILER TO FOLLOW*<br />The HEA is Sam.  Surprised?  You ought to be.  He was hardly present in the last 9 books.  In the final pages of DEA Ms. Harris springs this sudden passion on Sookie and Sam ... followed by 3 paragraphs of icky seal-sex that will forever haunt me during visits to Sea World.  Post coital Sookie surmises that the \\"love\\" was manufactured by the magical fairy device. THIS is the long-anticipated \\"Happily Ever After\\"?  I've seen dish soap commercials with higher emotional impact.<br /><br />This book did not flow, it jerked and spasmed between scenes as you guessed whose POV was speaking.  It was as if Ms. Harris had a specific agenda and would check off each item instead a weaving it into the story:  Make Sookie a selfish, whiney twit [check!]; Punish Eric for loving a human [check!]; Establish Christianity, Reproduction and \\"Being Normal\\" as TOP priorities [double check!]; Villainize all vampires and fae [check!]; Make Sam sexy and a convincing Sookie-mate [ch--oops, didn't quite getthat one done!].  Her story was filled with contradictions and inaccuracies as Ms. Harris re-wrote numerous \\"rules\\" of her supernatural world to accommodate her story.  DEA is evidence that this author was tired of riding the Sookie-verse money train and just wanted it to end.  After the first few chapters, I heartily agreed with her.<br /><br />I had great hopes for Sookie and her Essential Spark.  I wanted to see her using the courage and heart vested in her `spark' to fulfill her destiny of great accomplishments.  Unfortunately, Ms. Harris had other plans.  At the end of DEA, our Sookie-the-Vampire-Friend-and-Villain-Slayer rejects all things supernatural and regresses to her pre-Dead Until Dark life as just a barmaid.  The `spark' has been extinguished. RIP Sookie.

B00C4XYEBW|5.0|Judas Priest calls the new .d.v.d. Epitaph--wow!! These guys have a recording career full of nothing but highs. The only screw up in the legacy was a little thing called Rocka Rolla. This is a how to d.v.d., as in how to put on the greatest heavy metal concert of all time

B008CPZNL6|4.0|I have only had this for a week, but I like the concept. I am not sure about the content as I have not used it much as of yet.
B008S80PCE|5.0|Love it. I enjoy the music, and wanted to have the collection. Good price, good product. The product was new and in mint condition. If you like the artist it's a good buy at a good cost.
1400103282|5.0|I thought I'd probably like this book, but, overall, I ended up enjoying it even more than I expected.  One theme that comes through is that Wozniak was just following his passion.  In brief, as a kid and in high school he loved working on electronics projects, and he never set out to become rich by co-founding a company.<br /><br />By the way, I got two degrees in electrical engineering in the 1980s, so I could relate to some of the info in this book better than most people, and that did increase my enjoyment of this book.  However, even if I had a different background I still think I would have liked this book.
B009AP2G26|5.0|I watch the show with my daughter.  We don't have cable, but thanks to Amazon we can stay tuned and we are caught up.<br /><br />Gail
B00CXN2JNS|4.0|I'm still a bit bemused by this album - it feels like \\"Risk II\\" in parts (keep in mind that I don't find \\"Risk\\" terrible, just not a great 'deth album) - but the tone had not been set positively by the first single, \\"Super Collider.\\" Now that the album is out I must say that the songs I felt were so-so are much better within the context of the whole product. \\"Kingmaker\\" has the sort of drive I'd expect from Megadeth, but I can't help but thinking that I've heard the song before. It's a good album starter though. \\"Super Collider\\" follows, and still feels like its been touched by Bud Prager, and lacks the aggression and tempo I prefer from Angry Dave. It's \\"meh.\\" \\"Burn\\" gets things back on track musically, but lacks any sort of lyrical content worth remembering. Same goes for \\"Built for War\\" (or \\"Kick the Chair II\\"), which still has what feel to me to be misplaced repetitive \\"Built for War\\" refrains. The lyrical mud continues with \\"Over the Edge,\\" but it is at least enjoyable to hear Mustaine singing \\"I'm going crazy.\\" \\"Dance in the Rain\\" is certainly better than the previous three tracks, but I'm just feeling a decline in the quality of lyrical refinement overall. I do really dig angry Dave vocal effects at the end of this song. \\"Beginning of Sorrow\\" initially fell into the \\"I think I've heard this song before\\" category, but has grown on me substantially. Not terrible, not outstanding. \\"The Blackest Crow\\" totally redeems the album, apart from being one of the strongest songs it also feels fresh. The rather poppy \\"Forget to Remember\\" continues a strong finish, but remains illustrative of how un-thrash the album is overall. Production is non-descriptive and matches the overall unremarkable nature of the album. At least the tempo rises for \\"Don't Turn Your Back\\" and the cover of Lizzy's \\"Cold Sweat\\" is well translated. The non-album bonus tracks are particularly strong. So... \\"Super Collider\\" is lacking raw aggression and thrash. It'll fare no worse in my playlist than\\"Risk,\\" but continues the declining trend of recent Megadeth efforts. Second half is definitely the stronger. 7/10
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Love the show even though it is very dark.  I am hanging on at the edge of my seat. Looking forward to season 2.<br /><br />Gail
B000UPSKO8|5.0|One of the best Opera Galas ever produced.  Everyone seemed to be having so much fun.  Well worth the price.

B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|It's not the greatest show I've ever seen, however, it keeps me watching and I love the camaraderie between the two male leads, Gabriel Macht and Patrick J. Adams  Now, let's talk about the women.  Gina Torres is spectacular as are the other two ladies, Meghan Markle as Rachel (a paralegal) and Sarah Rafferty as Donna, Mr. Macht's secretary.  They are the three sparklers on the show and can bedazzle you without trying.  Rick Hoffman plays the Rumplestiltskin of the group named Louis Litt.  (Mary Tyler Moore once had a line where she called Lou Grant \\"Louis\\" when she was berating him and it was one of the funniest lines she ever read because Louis sounds like something you would call someone when you were belittling him for his total lack of smarts.  The name is perfect for Mr. Hoffman in this role and he plays it beautifully.  On the whole, this is one of the better law shows because it is smart an funny.  The men, with the exception of Mr. Hoffman, are handsome and the women are \\"che magnifique\\".
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|This movie keeps you drawn in.  The graphics and acting were really good. And I liked the story although I may say its a darker snow white. You'll love this movie!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I am so shocked at the reviews for this book. Like many ppl i have been waiting on this book for about eight months so imgine my shock when this is released. I have to confess that i am really really sad. Sad that she killed this story for what..fame? money?....what about us readers who were inlove with these charcters? Ms. Day how could u do this too us, and think that we would ever buy another one of ur books?!?!.....whats fuuny is that i didnt even read the entire book. i realized from the sample is was trash. When i went to buy the book off my wishlist i was mortified to see the ratings. I had to read the reviews of what ppl were saying....i didnt even know that she was planning to create another TWO book....are u sick lady!!!....so i had to see if it was true....i down loaded the sample and could tell it was not worth 10 dollars from chapter one's long drown out cab ride...ugh really!!. what she should have done was finished crossfire triliogy like she promised and then made up another....she already had the fans...we would have followed her just about anywhere.....but now my heart is broken and i can't finish this foolishness.....even in the sample the sex was way to much and too fast and just over the top....where is the plot? the story? i wanted much much more....i told everyone i no about you Ms. Day how great ur books are and how its a MUST read....now i look like the fool. Well you no what they say...fool me one shame on u....fool me twice shame on me....well shame on u Ms. Day!!!!...#Done!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was captivating from the start.  At each turn I was asking myself what else could happen.  And, then I got to the end and. ... Seriously! I was so ticked off.  While it may have been the perfect ending for this book, I hated it. Overall, it was a good book and well written.
B0063IH60K|3.0|App does the job, but not particularly elegant. Some clunky aspects versus the app I have on my phone (use this on kindle fire). Still, a legacy game that withstands the test of time .
B0050PYNOY|5.0|I don't that there are many times in the movie that I am not laughing at a scene. Then again, maybe this sexual humor is just really funny to me.
B008HJGPVO|4.0|A four star rating only because I wish there was a way that I could fasten it to my case.  The clip is need flexible enough to clip it onto any part of the case, otherwise I love the different sized tips it offers.

B000GCFBQU|4.0|My Dad's 93 and he still wears the &#34;robe&#34; of all that is expected of a New England preacher.  The most powerful moment in the book for me (as a preacher's daughter) was when Tyler's robe came off, and he said, &#34;I can't do this anymore.&#34;  He became so human and paradoxically so &#34;holy&#34; in that moment of extreme emptiness and grief.  Strout captures the clash of two worlds--the institutional church ideal and the outside the door real of life.  Strout powerfully weaves the tapestry of love throughout it all.
B00138KJY0|3.0|now i just like parts of it alot. im older now and i<br />can see its not perfect. the hits of course are great<br />and a couple other songs. its sometimes<br />a little faceless and boring..<br />there is filler. thriller is better. :)
B00AHGSVKS|4.0|\\"He glanced from land to sea and back again: it was some little time before he thought of looking at the sky...The huge and silent shadows driving across the stars, more miles above his head than he dared to guess, were as far beyond his little \\"Columbus\\" as it surpassed the log canoes of Paleolithic man. For a moment that seemed to last forever, Reinhold watched, as all the world was watching, while the great ships descended in their overwhelming majesty--until at last he could hear the faint scream of their passage through the thin air of the stratosphere.\\"<br /><br />So goes the opening scene of \\"Childhood's End\\" where alien spacecraft descend from outer space over Earth's great cities (and is easily recognizable as the opening for \\"Independence Day\\"). What do the aliens look like? Why are they here? Needless to say, \\"Childhood's End\\" isn't the bombastic, brainless romp that was \\"Independence Day\\" (where the super advanced aliens were defeated with the stroke of a key on a Mac). No, Mr. Clarke instead weaves an intricate \\"end of days\\" plot that is less about the explosions and more about his exposition regarding the true \\"alien invasion\\" and what its implications will be.<br /><br />The novel is broken into three parts including (1) the introduction to the Overlords and Karellen (their leader); (2) the Golden Age and (3) The Last Generation. First, we follow the Secretary-General Stormgren as he tries to unravel the mystery of the Overlords and then we shift to a Gatsby-like party where a revelation moves the story to Jan Rodricks and his quest to discover the overlord homeland and then finally to Jean and George whose children unwittingly become embroiled with the Overlords. \\"Childhood's End\\" is the antithesis of most \\"alien invasion\\" sci-fi out there and yet the ending is as satisfying and shocking (and sad) as any novel written in the last hundred years.<br /><br />The bottom line: Consider that this tale was written in the 1950s. Consider that much of the science is still relevant (though still unachievable). Consider that its implications for religion, evolution, and man's place in the universe are profound and the result (for the \\"niche\\" sci-fi reader) is a riveting, entertaining and gripping read on par with most modern speculative fiction. Unfortunately, for everyone else, \\"Childhood's End\\" will be a bore, a novel written for a different time, for a different audience, for a reader that appreciated more \\"off stage\\" material than today's reader would tolerate.<br /><br />-Raeden Zenence is still relevant (though still unachievable).

B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game I made a lot of cool stuff but the new 0.7.0 update hasn't came even though ipod/ipad/iphone already got it June 5<br />so y'all got to get the update the same time ipod/iphone/ipad get it.
B0036EH40Q|4.0|Well this is a must have movie for any western collection.  It seemed like a couple of minor scense were cut from the movie, not a real big deal.  The blue ray, and sound showed slight improvement over other copies.  To me some scense seemed a little darker than should be.  All in all not great blue ray, but OK
B005BGBPBG|5.0|I actually own this movie but I left it with my mom and I wanted to watch it I rented it. Well it is great. Some people just have those best friends that do whatever to get ahead including crushing your feelings so its good to stand up for yourself even if it means losing a friend.
B0085YOD1A|4.0|It makes it easy to see battery level quickly and since I can't see well it is easier to read.

B000JMKQX0|5.0|This was great.  Looking forward to the movie and I hope it stays pretty close to the book. The ultimate in the zombie genre.

B00CTSDDVO|5.0|When I went to see this in IMAX the day it came out, the system in the theater crashed. I was one of the most disappointing days ever. The reason why blu-ray sales for The Dark Knight, Dark Knight Rises, Tron Legacy, where big for me and I own all three is because they kept the IMAX scenes. The IMAX format has always been impressive and when a movie comes out in IMAX it's a real experience and scenes in IMAX makes it more impressive and you don't want it to end.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|The initial game only took a short time to download from Amazon, but when we tried to start the game, play it, it had to download the game Data.<br /><br />This took 4+ hours on a 1mb DSL line, even though the game said the download would only take a few minutes.<br />(You can stop the download and it does pick up where it left off.)<br /><br />There are only a few possible reasons this took so long.<br /><br />1) It was a HUGE amount of data.<br />2) Internet problems.<br />3) Source had a slow link.<br /><br />In any event we are enjoying the game so far.<br /><br /> PS<br /><br />Liked it so much, had to get the full version.
B0038NN3B4|4.0|As a female over 50, I did not lose or gain weight trying this out for three weeks. There were a few warnings about needing to drink a lot of water, which I did, but still suffered the same consequences of dehydration.  If you are sensitive to sugar alcohols or sugar free sweeteners, use caution.  I bought some of the Atkins snacks and they taste wonderful, but after two weeks, it caught up with me.  I was able to tolerate them at first and enjoyed one to two snacks per day.  It took about 10 days to heal my gut.<br /><br />I still believe this diet works wonders for some people if you do not get into the trap of eating too many unhealthy foods to stay low carb.  It would be easy to do.  I read about many success stories in the book even for women my age so it may just be that it doesn't work for me.  All in all, I am eating healthier and may go through phase 2 to see if that works.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Love the books. The show is pretty good and I love that I can download the episodes and watch them anywhere with out needing wifi.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Couldn't stop reading - this book tells it like it is for DevOps, but the lessons learned are definitely universally applicable.
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|I like movies where you don't know what is really going on but they give you hints so you should
B008MM9630|4.0|It`s like many of the farm games, so far. And it's really cute. My 4 year old opted for a different type of game. I want to figure out how to delete my progress so she can go through the tutorial...

B00C1BHQXK|4.0|Does it get much simpler or easy than focusing on just ONE THING?<br />The key is to focus on the One &#34;Right&#34; Thing...and when you do this<br />as everything else goes, your &#34;to do&#34; list items fall like domino's.<br /><br />Excellent concept, reintroduced.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Absolutely love this book. Could not stop reading this book. Fits right along with the series. Can't wait until the next book.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|A great way to pass through stressful moments without resorting to soda or other vices.<br />Quick responses and colorful screen.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|this game is definitely a challenge for me. You really have to pay attention and it needs practice. Maybe that is why I enjoy playing it over and over again.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Wow...wow...wo.w!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SOOOOO many awesome ideas one can ever image for any occasion! Love it! Soon to be # 1 watch out martha stewart!
B00AKFG15S|3.0|I was so disappointed in the ending, I guess he left it like that to do a fourth sequel to the series
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Can't wait for season six to start but we have to wait until September:( The show gets better every season.
B004UID2LC|5.0|When I originally got this I downloaded the videos on Wi-Fi....Well one day I accidentally clicked on a video and discovered you can watch the already downloaded vids offline...I love it..it works great
B008JFUO0Y|3.0|I saw this in theaters not long after its release. If your a fan of the originals and of gore then its great for the awesome, gruesome scenes and the many visual nods to the original 2 Evil Dead films. Otherwise the plot is VERY straightforward and predictable.<br /><br />As for everyone saying the characters are dumb, I don't know what they are talking about. Only particularly stupid thing is that no one really seems overly concerned about all the dead cats (still not that bad, is it that hard to believe that they wouldn't take it seriously? Leaving won't help their friend and getting her somewhere else isolated would be difficult) and the teacher opening the book despite warnings and barbed wire. Again, not particularly stupid. If you saw such a book would you really take it seriously? It also mentioned (albeit very briefly) that the guy had a bit of a fascination with horror and the occult, giving him even more reason to ignore the warnings.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|I am quite pleased with how nice it looks and how addictive it is. Plus, the adorable puddings add an extra incentive. :)
B0042UEU8M|5.0|A romantic tear-jerker.  It's cliche' & formulaic but who cares?!...troubled boy is haunted by his past, only to meet a pretty girl who helps him deal with the guilt of his little brother's death. Zac Efron and Amanda Crew aren't going to win an Academy Award for this performance but, again, who cares?  I'm a sucker for romance and I loved it...it is what it is.  If you are in love with love, watch this one.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|It is like YouTube and easier to use but you need WiFi which sucks .well I have a kindle fire and it worked great. But after a while it slows down
B003F3NDOE|5.0|Love this show, and the bonus extras are fun! I can't help wondering what would have happened next, if this series continued for a fifth season...and a sixth...hey, I know it's wishful thinking on my part.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Ended too soon and abruptly it was good don't get me wrong.  Still the same hot sex and great story with lots going on but this felt like the build up to something much more going on.  There is a nice twist though.
B001L1S1SK|5.0|Can never get enough of this show, and the bonus extras are fun. My favorite episodes in this season are the ones where Lindsay Lohan guest-starred as Betty's nemesis from junior and senior high school, Kimberly &#34;Kimmie&#34; Keegan.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|The grandchildren really love this new activity. It seems to keep them constantly busy trying to beat one another. They used to play this type of activity when we would go out at the various arcades, now they can play when they are at home.
B0025KVLSI|3.0|\\"Beatles For Sale\\" isn't often described as anybody's favorite Beatles album. I don't even know anyone who says it's their favorite. It's not my favorite either. But I will defend it from ridicule. The formula for \\"Beatles For Sale\\" is similar to the formula for their debut album, \\"Please Please Me\\". The Beatles went back to their pre-EMI days to select a few cover tunes they played all the time at the Cavern and in Hamburg. These were recorded quickly, along with a small handful of Lennon-McCartney originals. They recorded this album in a hurry because they were experiencing world wide Beatlemania at its' peak. The Beatles recorded this album between dates of a world tour in 1964. They went to perform in Australia and New Zealand immediately after completing the album.<br /><br />Despite the album being a rushed affair, it's a decent effort. \\"Eight Days A Week\\", \\"What You're Doing\\", \\"I'm A Loser\\" and \\"No Reply\\" are highlights, all Lennon-McCartney originals. All of the cover tunes included are powerful recordings that recall The Beatles' formative years playing extremely long sets in Germany. Listen to \\"Everybody's Trying To Be My Baby\\", \\"Kansas City / Hey Hey Hey Hey\\", \\"Honey Don't\\" and \\"Rock And Roll Music\\" and it's not hard to imagine them playing in a hot, sweaty club.<br /><br />There are two songs that I don't care for, however; \\"Baby's In Black\\" (a depressing Lennon-McCartney original) and \\"Mr. Moonlight\\". These aren't terrible enough to skip, but they aren't anywhere near the top of my favorite Beatles songs list.<br /><br />This isn't an essential release unless you absolutely love The Beatles.
193700788X|3.0|You gotta read this if you have read all of the rest - just check it out from the library. Thanks for the memories, Charlaine! A rush job, but think the author has been so done with Bon Temps for a few years now.  ***SPOILERS FOLLOW*** In my opinion Sookie ended up with the logical choice, offering her a possibility of a more normal life - kids, going out in the daytime, cooking meals for her man...etc.  Eric has kind of been missing in action for the last few books, so it wasn't that difficult for him to completely disappear off the scene.  I quit buying the books after volume #5, so no monetary loss.  I see another book will be published this fall, to tie up all loose ends.
B007TUAHVQ|5.0|Was absolutely wonderful just what he wanted and I didn't have to run all over trying to find it.  Thanks a million.
B005CRQ4XI|1.0|I don't understand what the main character was thinking with the questionable decisions she made. This did not inspire me.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|I am usually disappointed in movies. I either flat out don't enjoy them or at best they are entertaining enough that I'll enjoy watching them once, but don't really care to see them again. I can honestly say that I loved this movie, and I would love to watch it again. There was just enough ridiculousness to make me laugh out loud at times, and it was painfully awkward at times (which made it even funnier), but it also had some really sweet moments. The casting was perfect and they made the story believable. Thumbs up for this one.
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|Star Wars and Pinball - need there be anymore said?  We all love to play this on the Fire.  Great game and lots of fun.
B00BCK1A5G|5.0|This was such a brilliant book- totally totally amazing!!!! Nalini outdid herself - I just couldn't stop reading it it was so engrossing.
B004LQGXLE|5.0|It is one of the greatest westerns and funniest performances by Paul Newman. This film never goes out of style.
B005544TRQ|5.0|We have never heard of the series, but thought that we would try it out by watching the pilot.  The show's plot kept us on the edge of our chair, it seems try to life, the photography of the intro is very attention-getting, and the characters are developed well.  We look forward to watching more episodes when we get a chance to have time to sit.
B0070DQYPU|4.0|I ENJOYED THIS MOVIE VERY MUCH. CAST WAS GREAT Also the story line really held your interest from beginning to end.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|Lots of bullets flying, explosions, car crashes, helicopters....action and first 10-20 minutes is good solid action BUT then Bruce actually starts speaking and his dialogue is so terrible and his acting is not much better. Apparently being a smart-ass no longer natural for him and he just not able to pull it off. Date movie: maybe. Viewing with spouse: yes but occasional bad language. Man only viewing: yes for the action.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I purchased this book because I had read such good reviews and I was certainly not disappointed. This is the ultimate story of survival! You truly become emotionally connected to the main character due as much to his limitless optimism and ingenuity as to his very understandable and often comical flaws. This is a story that showcases what humanity can do when tragedy strikes and success is rests upon our ability to pull together our strengths. Some of the science and math discussed in the story can get a little heady but I was thrilled by how much I did understand. In short, read this book. You won't be disappointed.
B00C7DGRL4|3.0|It was alright. Ok to watch if you work nightshift and are off a night and can't sleep. Renner is unfortunately for Gun Control and against the 2nd Amendment.
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|This books have strong facts about sexism. Lisbeth is an amazingly strong woman and those books are pure awesomeness.<br />And I cried watching the movies..
B0076DELIG|4.0|Can't get enough of Bosch. He always finds a way to stay alive!  Looking forward to more about Bosch from Michael Connelly.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Great storyline, even though some things were expected it still kept the surprises fresh.It was a good actor's feeling showing.Gandalf could had been better he sounded older than the previous versions of the LOTR.Still is worth every buck.
B00A9ET4MC|3.0|Ms Adichie has given us insights into racial and gender issues that only an outsider can perceive.  As a Nigerian in the United States and then as an Americanized Nigerian who returns, she is sensitive to behaviors and beliefs.  These insights make the book worth reading.  However, her story and the character development are weak and the ending is a disappointment.
B007EC27QM|5.0|It is handy where ever I go.  Large numbers and the Kindle Fire fits right in my purse making this calculator at my hands when I need it.  I have a calculator on my phone, but the numbers are harder to see.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I've been reading this out of sequence. There is so much info. It's really freaking' GREAT!! My daughter has started reading some. She loves them too
B007MB5OCE|3.0|Once you read the title and about 50 pages of the book it became boring.  The events were interesting but  with predictable outcomes.  It was like opening one of those Russian dolls, you knew there was going to be another, you just wondered how small would they go.  It wasn't a page turner but not bad for a quick read until you got through all of the developing situations.
B00BI73CVI|1.0|Hugh Jackman opens his mouth to sing. Or rather scream.<br />The camera moves steadily to his dirt-grimed face, his pop-eyed reddened eyes, his bulging veins,  that open, trembling mouth.<br />We're within an inch of his quivering lips and can even see the back of his exhausted throat.<br />I was hoping that the use of CGI could keep moving the camera until we were traveling down into the interior of the actor's body to show us how it must look before someone has a heart attack.<br />Director Tom Hooper made much internet buzz when he gleefully announced that instead of using pre-recorded singing, all his cast would sing ALIVE!<br />Bad mistake.<br />It was even bad back in the early talkies when movie makers discovered that singers would look, and sound much better, when they lip-synced to their vocals.<br />Watching all the performers straining to perform live vocals for the cameras was a nerve-wracking experience for this viewer.<br />I kept thinking of the endless takes it must have taken to get the perfect one.<br />Worse, none of the performers sounded any better for being forced to sing live for the cameras.<br />Russell Crowe was so miscast that I winced every time he opened his mouth emit sounds that were supposed to be singing.<br />Anne Hathaway, covered with grime, dirt, her hair shorn, resembled the inmate of a Nazi concentration camp.<br />Her bony face, bulging eyes and hideously bedraggled attire repulsed, rather than engendered pity.<br />Yet, I've read that when she gabbled the famous, \\"I Dream a Dream,\\" many female viewers sobbed hysterically and had to leave the theater.<br />Okay, call me old-fashioned. I like my musicals to exude vibrant, beautiful costumes, color, talent and story line. Like \\"Seven Brides for Seven Brothers,\\" \\"Westside Story\\" and yes, even \\"Mama Mia.\\" Yes, we all know the singers would be mouthing the words to an already recorded track, but that didn't mar our delight to hear sometimes unforgettable vocalizing.<br />For me, trying to enjoy a nearly three hour long movie that looks like it was filmed through a pile of mud and dirt, where everybody resembles someone whose been dipped in a coal mine, and thin, wavering voices that made me close my eyes in pain, I'll take those glorious musicals of the olden days!ying to enjoy a nearly three hour long movie that looks like it was filmed through a pile of mud and dirt, where everybody resembles someone whose been dipped in a coal mine, and thin, wavering voices that made me close my eyes in pain, I'll take those glorious musicals of the olden days!
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|After I started this book I couldn't put it down. In fact I went away for a week and left my ipad at home by accident and I read the majority of this book on my iPhone! This book was so moving. The author expressed herself so well- I felt like I was there with her emotionally ( even though I shared none of her experiences). Truly a great read!!!
B00CUWWLWG|1.0|Unfortunately this app find wouldn't even open once the download finished. I would like to try it but I don't even know if is designed for kindle or is just kind of faulty.
B004UFEJW6|5.0|I love this flick. Very good action in space movie. I had to buy the Blu Ray version too. Kurt Russell does a great job again beyond the script he was handed. A standard but well done story, with good effects for a B type movie, and some great action and fight scenes. Once again Russell creates a memorable tough guy persona and communicates much while speaking little. Not an easy thing to do. Few actors have ever done that well, and Kurt is quite commendable.<br /><br />This is also not done in that dreary, boring, too dark, monotone look so many movies of this genre are filmed like nowadays. No wannabe video game look please.<br /><br />Jason Scott Lee also puts on a solid performance as the manufactured human archenemy along with some others you will recognize.<br /><br />I also like the human spiritual and philosophical side as well. Russell is trained from birth to be less than human, a thoughtless, merciless, coldblooded killer by those that think they are better, smarter, superior types who think they can do what they want to get what they want.<br /><br />In the end Kurt and the lowly outcasts demonstrate it's not just your upbringing, or what you have or your station in life that makes you special or great, it's what's inside that counts.  A good moral, if not always true in reality. But this is fiction after all.<br /><br />Might I also add, a  sequel would be cool too!
B009JZTOG8|4.0|So good. Although so many things happen that I lose track of what is going on.  Also, wondering who the next villain will be.  It's like a day time soap opera with a magic wand.  Heart Belle.  She is awesome!
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|Excellent movie. I watched it twice, once in the theater and once at home. I liked it both times. Tom Cruise did a real good job with the character. The movie is well done and I thought the plot was better than most of what's been coming out lately in the mystery, action type genre.<br /><br />Yeah, it's not quite the same as the book, I read that too, but whatever is. Yes, height and size may be different from the book character but it really did not impact the movie at all. Actually, I thought Cruise's portrayal was more realistic than the book character. All in all a fresh and entertaining \\" who done it\\" movie with some very good, but not comic book over the top action.
B009HNDCC4|3.0|It's lost its laugh out loud factor.  Remember first season with Jay slapping the chicken.  Well now, it's done.  Hope it redeems itself next season!  Also, I am tremendously sad that there was be no Modern Family fix this summer.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|this was an excellent movie.  played on the heart strings, so might be careful with children watching.  would teach loyalty for the child but would need some explanation along the way. made us cry. haven;t seen a touching but good movie for awhile..
B000QCS8TW|5.0|The second book is just as great as the first! Happy to have stared the series and I plan on finishing them all!
B00AKKTDJY|2.0|I bought this game with coins on my kindle, it took my coins, but won't allow me to play past the trial! I click on restore purchase and it tells me it failed and to try again later????
B00280LYIM|4.0|I love the book it is great and I hope he writes more<br />Can't wait for the next book!<br />!!!
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Where do I begin? I have never in my life read a book that had a lead character so annoying and childish. Anastasia has to be one of the worst literary characters ever created. How this author mentioned to have zero character development blows my mind! Anastasia was annoyingly clueless about the world in the first book and boyyy did her ignorance get worse in the second book! It took me forever to read this trash because the dialogue was over the top and the decisions Anastasia made were beyond stupid. If you loved the first book then you will love this one I'm sure but if you were on the fence about this series after reading book one DO NOT READ THIS BOOK, you will regret it, trust me!
B0085YOD1A|1.0|This app is pretty useless and is wrong sometimes. Once, I had it at 86% and it said 6 hours, but at 55% it said OVER A DAY!!!!! You can change your settings to show the percentage of your battery. DON'T GET THIS !!!!
0689835604|5.0|This is my grand-daughters 3rd book of where's the belly button. It's one of her favorites. It's cute to lift up the flaps. We've bought another of Karen Katz books with flaps and short lines on every page and she loves them too. Just enough words not too long for her to lose interest.
B006ON41FC|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!.But seriously I really like  this game. The creator needs to make more applications like this.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|I've bought the occasional ep or two of a show I liked on Amazon Instant Video, but this is the first time I bought an entire season. I do not regret my choice one bit. The show is excellent and I'm so happy to have the whole season legally (see HBO, people will avoid piracy if you give them options!) to watch any time I want. Love love love this show.
B0085YOD1A|4.0|This app is very good to use if you are wanting to see how much longer your device has to change!!
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Great game with an addictive action. One of my favorite match-3 games. Brilliant color and graphics and lots of flash. If you like games that make you think and act fast, you'll love this game.<br /><br />Lyn.goodnight
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|After waiting what seemed like years for its release I ended up reading one of the worse &#34;to be continued...&#34; I was expecting a trilogy (as in 3) not a series. I know it's just a book, but I feel we were cheated. It was such a horrible ending...horrible i tell you! I had to get a refund. I will not be in line to get the FOURTH book that's for sure.
B000I8ERVC|5.0|Wow, how could I have gone this long without watching this movie?  It is a look into the fringe of society at the time of its making yet the film explores themes that are just as relevant today as it was then.  It is much more difficult to be &#34;different&#34; than average.  In a country that consistently preaches how much it values Freedom, people that live free are admonished.  So there is the meaning I took from this film.  The pure entertainment value is awesome as well.  Great actors, beuitiful scenery and the development of the characters made me feel as though I knew them.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|So Addictive, just like at the fair when I was a little girl but better because all you have to do is wait and you get more coins.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Awesome graphics and effects. Lots of brain teasers,nooks and crannies. Sometimes I felt like I was on a wild goose chase though. Make sure when you are placing objects that you move it around the area that you think it should go. The object starts off opaque but becomes solid when placed correctly.<br />All I all a great game!!
B00729GQ0A|5.0|One of my top five favs! Sophia and Charles characters were spot on to keep me reading and being tired for the next day. A friend past this onto me for my vakay at the beach and being a lover of the paranornimal she knew it would be a great read for me. She loved it and I give it a must read.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The hunger gams has always been my fav book seiries . But it does have flaws , it is much better than the 3rd book though.
B000SEGUDE|1.0|I should not say I hated the book,  it was chosen for the book club I am a part of.  I tried to read it,  but could not even make it out of the first chapter.  Thought about renting the movie,  but I so disliked what I had read that I didn't want to waste more money on that.
B00992CF6W|5.0|When is update for my kindle going to come out. I have trying to join my friends games but the surver is outdated please fix it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love Downton Abbey. I watched the third season and decided I need to catch up before Season 4 comes out. I am so glad I have taken the time. I am a little over halfway through Season 2, but don't want to finish too soon. I think I will go through withdrawal. The character development is fantastic, and I love the lack of foul language, violence and nudity. It is story telling at its finest.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Slow start but want a good description of the main caracter you almost think the are real. But i didn't like the end even do it's difficult to find a good end.
B006M7JCC2|4.0|It took some time before I decided to buy this book. I knew the events very well prior to purchase, and I was a little uneasy about reading it because of my own preconceptions. That said, I loved this book. From a literary point of view you might argue that it is somewhat repetitious. That is true, but the points made perhaps deserve repeating.<br /><br />It is indeed fascinating. If you have ever read the works of Esther and Jerry Hicks (qv!) then you will find that Anita's experience is entirely compatible with that world view. This was a reinforcing point for me. It required of me that I revisit some of my own behaviours, and helped me to focus better on creating my own unique future, re-established my focus if you like.<br /><br />On reviewing some of the more negative comments here, I would say that the real issue with those comments lies in two major areas: a closed mind due to religious beliefs, and poor comprehension or inaccurate reading of what Anita has actually said. I am recommending this book to anyone who has experienced fear in their lives, or who feels unworthy for whatever reason. I think this book will be a source of healing, both physical and mental IF the reader allows it.
B007N6NGYG|5.0|I've always like trains, but I rarely have had the time, the money or the space to have any. This games graphics are marvelous and the more you play the more addicting it gets. I wish there was a sim-type app for people who want to build a working train set on their computer who do not have the space for real ones. If someone were to develop it, they must use the graphics from this game. The controls are sleek and fast, and the puzzles are a challenge of timing and accuracy. I must admit there are a few levels that I'm having trouble with, but my frustration with the right timing and the right switching patterns are part of the addiction to the game. You gotta try this one and give it some time... you won't want to stop playing.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Love this CD but didnt realize it was unedited so there is foul language but i love bruno mars alot
B00C7DGRL4|5.0|I'm shocked at how much I like this movie! I've watched it twice in one day and I'll probably watch it again soon. The premise is wonderful and the acting is great. The writing is crisp, clean and moves the story along beautifully. I don't know if there is a sequel to this story that could live up to the standard this has set, but I'd give it a chance. I had a similar reaction the Snow White and the Huntsman. I think they may be on to something here. Fairy Tales for adults... now thats great Hollywood theatre!
0425263924|1.0|I have never taken the time to review a book before but felt so cheated over this one I am.  I will not revew the story because there isn't one.  This was nothing more than cashing in an a successful series then leaving fans on the hook.  The writing was jumbed and splintered.  Made me dislike Eva and after the ending I feel like Gideon himself cheated on me.  If the author was not laughing ll the way to the bank she would be ashamed.
B00CFQN12Q|4.0|I've always been a Die Hard fan, I especially liked the second movie, but this one is a little disappointing. Great car chases, explosions, shoot outs, but little good acting and no real catchy scenes. The trailer is as good as the movie, which is usually a sign that something is amiss. I hate when all the best scenes are in the trailer... there's no reason to see the movie! I watched, I saw, I added to my collection, but thats about it.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Menu screen too wide on my tablet, game screen okay, wish there wasn't limit to play time, but enjoy game
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I read a lot of old literature and needed something new and fresh. I realized a few pages into the book that it was set in my home city, so that made it all the more enjoyable.<br /><br />Long story short, it is a good read, but this isn't Tolstoy. I think it has been a bit over rated on amazon.com, but it is clever, well written, and touching. I would recommend it to my friends.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|It is a bit of a slow starter,  but once you get lots of algae producing corals planted,  it is a lot of fun! I love the graphics!
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I Suggest watching this. Every season gets better! I am addicted and can't wait for the Season 5 start. I am glad a friend recommended it.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|The only thing better than one cute on nom, is 6!! I couldn't put this game down and had my mind set on getting 3 stars on every level!!<br />  Warning- This game is addictive......very addictive!!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This book was excellently written and I absolutely loved it! I thought it was excellent and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to read a great romance novel with action included. The movie they made of this was also excellent. However, you CANNOT just pick one of these books in the middle of the series (or in this case, the end), it will make NO SENSE whatsoever. Also, watching the movies out of order is a bad plan, even if the first one sucks :(. Anyways, happy reading!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Keeps me on the edge all the time..fascinating characters all the way around ! Watch this one time and you will be hooked.
B004SIP8JI|5.0|Most enjoyable movie. The stars are perfect for the roles. I think a sequel would be really a delight to see
B00C7607FS|5.0|According to my friends at Disney this Blu-ray edition will be be released on 10/1/13. It was pushed back some (originally this was to be a June release) due to some minor problems.<br /><br />Also, so I'm told, they thought a release closer to Christmas would help sales. My friends also tell me this may even be pushed back 2 or 3 more weeks if it's decided by marketing that will spur more holiday purchases.<br /><br />I've not seen the Blu-ray yet (if I get lucky I'll get one a month or so before the official release) but am told the picture and sound are, quite simply, astounding.<br /><br />BTW this is my 21 year old daughters favorite movie!<br /><br />************UPDATE ***** UPDATE ******UPDATE ********<br /><br />Last week (today is 7/1/13), at the annuual Disney Products Christmas Preview in NYC, it was confirmed that the release date for The Little Mermaid Blu-Ray will be 10/1/13.<br /><br />******************LAST UPDATE **********LAST UPDATE**************<br /><br />Today I received a 'advance' copy to view. Yeah - I know why bother!?<br /><br />What I received was just the Blu-Ray so all I can say is that the picture looked brand new and was about as good as it could be.<br /><br />I know this doesn't help much as I was first told I would get this more than 2 weeks ago but this was beyond my control. So - no special anything - just the bare bones Blu-Ray - I was told that Disney is clamping down on advance copies so I guess I was lucky to get even this.
076781326X|4.0|Excellent casting. Excellent music. I wish it had been a lot longer, because it was so enjoyable to watch and listen to.
B007SGM084|5.0|Very entertaining and kept me coming back for more for a total of six months. Would recommend highly. Can't wait for the next one
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|What can say, Sylvia day did it again.  Gideon and Eva love for each other is amazing. How they possessed each other and still be true to them self is crazy. I love that Gideon love Eva so much that life is not worth living without her in it, and Eva the same. Because of what Gideon did, they had to hide there relationship to the world, but that didn't stop them from spending every moment with each other. As time passes by, you see how they trust each other more each day. I love this book and would recommend it anyone who love a good possession books. CAN'T WAIT TILL THE NEW ONE COME OUT.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|It seems as if a sixty-five year old man shouldn't be reading this story for the first time. But I've always been a slow learner.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love this book(series)  BUT I'm so tied of books that go on and on!  I would rather pay more for the book or books no more then 3 and be able to enjoy it. By the time the next book comes out I've read so many I have to go back and reread the  previous ones . I  have started selecting books to read that are not a series or not a finished series yet.
1623420148|5.0|5 HILARIOUS Stars!!<br /><br />This is literally the funniest book I think I've ever read.<br />It's told completely from the male POV. And Drew...he's funny.<br />I was just laughing my ass off throughout the entire thing.<br />And it's not stupid funny, it's clever funny.<br />Does that make sense?<br /><br />I started off thinking Drew was a jerk, and believe me he was.<br />And he still has his moments, but that's just him and Kate likes him that way.<br /><br />The man definitely learns how to romance a woman, but he takes his sweet time figuring it out.<br /><br />Kate is an amazing woman. She's only been in one relationship and it's a relationship that has lasted over a decade.<br />When I first learned this, I didn't think Drew had a chance. I mean that's a long time to be with someone.<br />Kate is a strong willed, witty, and brilliant woman. She gives Drew a run for his money, that's for sure.<br /><br />Overall, this book was such a FUN read and it was light! Not overly dramatic, but still heartfelt.<br />Emma Chase has an amazing work here, and I can't read to experience more from her!
B00992CF6W|4.0|Minecraft is one of the best games I have ever played! When I bought this I thought it was going to be AT LEAST as good as the xbox version but it was FAR away from being that good. some things I would like to be added are<br /><br />-more mobs<br />-redstone(pistons,minecarts,pressure plates,etc.)<br />-INFINITE WORLDS(or at least as big as xbox worlds..)<br />-potions<br />-enchanting<br />-and just about everything else Pc and xbox have!<br /><br />IF MOJANG DEVELOPERS ARE READING THIS,WHERE IS THE 0.7.0 VERSION? MY FRIENDS HAVE IT ON THEIR PHONES??? But all in all,this game is worth $7!!!!!
B00AFEY354|5.0|This movie was so true to the book. It was such an emotional story that so many people can relate to.<br />This is my favorite movie adaptation by far. I absolutely adore this movie. One of my favorites!
B005544V6A|5.0|Even if you hate court room dramas you will love this show. The witty banter is cleverly written and the charters within the show are fantastic. They are all very good actors.
147674355X|5.0|This quite possibly may be my favorite book of all time.<br />It's so hard to choose a favorite book, but oh the love I feel for this one!<br /><br />There isn't a main character in the book I don't adore.<br />It's such a beautiful, thought provoking, heartbreaking story.<br />And I absolutely loved it!<br />I can't recommend this one enough and I will keep recommending it to people<br />until the whole damn world reads it!
B001UGB1X8|3.0|I saw this video several months ago, so did not finish viewing it this time....I liked it the first time, though, and everything operated properly and as expected this time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a great, fast faced game that can be very addictive!  Requires good hand and eye coordination.  But the best thing about this game is the price...FREE!!!  I hope you enjoy it as much as we have.
B0083DJUMA|4.0|Liked the format  and style of  asuthor , shows where we are headed and how to get there. Must reading if you are interested in what is  happening in the 3 D  sector.
B00BLSJI80|5.0|Demi Lovato's sound is a little different in this album, but it's good.  It has feisty songs such as &#34;Firestarter&#34; mixed with emotional songs like &#34;Nightingale.&#34;  I absolutely love it.
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|Good actors and an interesting story. Can't go wrong with this director. I wish I had this one for more than 24 hours.

B008V8FVTI|4.0|Well done.  A lot of stars when they were younger and great acting by Kevin Bacon.  Brad Pitt is learning how to be a much better actor in this movie.  Great story!
B009KUWWW0|4.0|I like Ken Follett. As with his other novels I found this to be very interesting and informative and the characters to be very human and realistic.  I did get a bit discouraged over half way through the book. It seems that evil doers do not get punished and indeed get rewarded.  A man can be a convicted murderer and rapist and yet he will be made Lord of a fiefdom  and later an Earl.  A prior can break into and steal from the nun's treasury to build himself a palace and when found out, nothing happens.  One could say that the two main protagonists triumph in the end but that is only because they outlive some, not all, of the evil doers.
B004UJAOLM|2.0|I could not understand half of wat I read in just the first chapter.  And many of the words I didn't get didn't have definitions.  I put it down and won'tpick it back up

B00C4YZ12C|5.0|Very fun game! Kind of a mix between Geometry Wars and Galaga. I got this app with the free app of the day, but I would have paid for it.
B008Y6SLL2|4.0|Gives you a good look at corporate ethics and the way power and money absolutely corrupts one soul.  A good character study of the various employees and their different stages  of corruption complicity.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I'm totally sucked into this game. Great graphics. Spooky. Fun. Now I need the next level to save the mom.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Great metaphor about how the government manipulates their fellow countrymen. Also how it cannot last.  Only the first story in a series, you can already see the unraveling their power.
B00CWM3F4C|5.0|When it was announced that AiC was recording the album that became 'Black Gives Way to Blue,' I was very excited. AiC was one of my favorite hard rock/metal bands of the 90s, and I felt they were sorely missed in the current music scene. Of course, I felt some trepidation about anyone trying to take Layne Staley's place, but, on the other hand, Jerry Cantrell's vocals were a integral part of the overall AiC sound and he was still in the band. 'Black Gives Way to Blue' turned out to be a great album that could have been recorded as the 1997 or '98 successor to their 1995 self titled album with Layne still alive and aboard. 'The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here' is an even better album that showcases William Duvall's talent even more. I watched AiC recently and was very pleased with the way Duvall handled the songs that originally featured Layne Staley. In my opinion, Duvall is a legitimate singer in his own right, but that night his voice had the same melancholy/eerie quality that had been Staley's most appealing feature. His voice blended perfectly with Cantrell's, and though many people will surely disagree with me, there were times during the old classics when I felt that if I closed my eyes, I could believe that it was 1993 all over again. I say all of that to say that I am okay with the fact that Layne Staley isn't the lead singer of AiC anymore. I wish that he could have kept himself clean and had continued making great music with AiC, but the fact that they replaced Staley is no reason to write off what the band is creating now. 'The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here' is chocked full of songs that retain the mid-tempo metal that AiC is known for. The first three songs are all perfect examples of this. The album also contains the acoustic/electric songs that alienated AiC from some of there fans when they began to play them. 'Voices' and 'Scalpel' are examples of this. As far as the vocals are concerned, with or without Layne Staley, 'The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here' is very satisfying. Cantrell is still Cantrell, and his voice is still foreboding and melancholy in its own right. Blended with Duvall's voice, the vocals on TDPDH are as strong as anything AiC has recorded. Whether you are already a 21st century AiC convert or if you are still waiting for Staley to reincarnate, TDPDH is a great album and I can't recommend it higher. It's so nice having AiC back, and I hope they continue making quality records like this one for years to come.
B0007PAMR4|5.0|A Great movie. Dune is always a great read, it is one of the greatest science fiction series ever written.
B000WSFTO2|1.0|The book was in the worst shape... I understand that it is old, but it isn't what was pictured. I was looking for the version displayed.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Great book!! Very captivating to read had a little bit of everything in it wished there were a second book
B00000634J|5.0|It is a good variety of his music. I can listen to every song. That is the way I like to enjoy music. I want to be able to listen and enjoy<br />the whole cd.
B009LMTDL0|3.0|As a woman in tech, I was curious what all the fuss over this book was about. I was surprised to find this was very similar to the keynote she gave at Grace Hoppers couple years ago.<br /><br />There are some stylistic slip ups, but overall a well researched and well put (but grounded) call to arms on all fronts to keep working towards gender equality.<br /><br />The most interesting parts to me, were the points about the way gender affects the way people interpret your behavior and the anecdotes that show Sandberg freaking out over little things :)
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I did not know what this was about. The best way to watch. I know this illness, it is in my family. This was dignified, and written with<br />respect for all the characters. Honest.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love this app! great game :) no problems with it what so ever. totally addicted. I had never played it before.
B00992CF6W|3.0|wont let me update app please fix this I don't want to see a good game go to waste<br /><br />!!!!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game because I don't have to do the same courses over again and we get to have new charecters and I love everything about the game don't change anything about the app
B0040HO01Y|5.0|So glad I found this series; the character's are refreshing and clean! A mix of humor, drama, sadness and love that is guaranteed to pull you in and make you anxious about watching the episode to follow!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best I recommend you buy it you will be blown away by its awesomeness get subway surfers
B00992CF6W|4.0|So I just got this app 3 days ago and my brothers have the updated one but mine is not updating!!!!! It's so frustrating when will it update? Grrrrr can't join their games can't have them come help!!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft gets too be hard and easy.It is about building blocks,flying,and killing monsters.Yes you can die.Only in survival though.It is not inappropriate.But some mods are so you should read about them first.Same with following apps.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|its so fun.I love it.buy this I dare you.you can build your own leaf city in grass and you can battle other guys.realyfunfunfunfunfunfunfunfun.buy it.please.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is super fast and so easy to use. I love it !You can also play against people in other countries,States, and cities.
B009AMANBA|3.0|A lot more was going on the background historically than I realized. There was more political maneuvering than I was aware of by Lincoln. And Lincoln got the opposition to vote with him. This is good historical insight for all Americans to know. It also amused me at times how much our Congress back then seemed as rowdy as Parliament.
B005T87QCI|4.0|U can actually use your own skills, well you have to learn the controls first but  putting aside that fact that you have to buy some characters it is pretty cool
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Has real, doable exercises so you can prove to yourself that it works.<br /><br />The only thing I would add is emotion. Once love is added, the results multiply exponentially. To add love, simply practice thinking of something you care deeply about, such as a child, favorite part of a movie, anything that gives you that feeling in your chest. I don't know how to describe it, a warmth, a quickening. You know the feeling. Take a few minutes to focus on something you love, feel the feeling it produces, then switch your focus to the exercise (or whatever you want) and push the feeling of love towards that. Surround it. Smile about it. Tell it you love it and it loves you. Then express gratitude, as if you already have it.<br /><br />With a little practice, it grows stronger and undeniable.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|This was the last one for me - and I was a true, fan!  But I think \\"Lee Child\\" should now move on.  The series is somewhat corrupted by the recent film.  The tall, tough and sort of Ugly was portrayed by that short guy who never got over winning the \\"cutest graduate\\" from his high school, and has made so many action films now he must be held up by sticks.  That, combined with the lack of character development in the book has played out.  Sure, he's making a lot of money for \\"Child\\" but time for something new and different.  Burn the old formula \\"Lee\\" - we all know it by heart!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think subway surfers is amazing because it's absolutely epic for a free game and you can compete with friends and it is pretty cool
B004I744AS|5.0|As a dictionary, this app is great. A good dictionary is downloaded for offline use, but online gives not only a much more expansive dictionary, but the ability to translate words into other languages, a thesaurus, games (I play hangman at least once a day), &#34;Quote of the Day&#34;, &#34;This day in History&#34;, American and British audio pronunciation of English words, and, honestly, probably a lot of other things that I haven't figured out yet.<br />And this is the FREE version! (Okay, &#34;ad-supported&#34; version, but the ads are very un-intrusive...no full-page pop-ups or anything like that.)<br /><br />I've seen a lot of paid-version dictionaries that don't have as much value as this free app. If you don't have a dictionary on your Android device yet, you can stop searching now, because this is the one you want.
B005M2A4D4|5.0|Why are there title misprints on episodes for example \\"A Good Mab Goes To War\\" and \\"The Marriage Of River Sond.\\" You would think this would have been fixed before release
B0088P2A7A|4.0|It's nice to be able to access Wikipedia directly via this app.<br /><br />Pro: You don't have to open a web browser, and all the overhead and battery drain that goes with it, to use Wikipedia.<br />Con: In a web browser, you can open a link to a related page in a new tab and have them both open. If there's a way to create a new window/tab in this app, it's very well hidden, because I haven't found it yet.<br /><br />Pro: It doesn't save your searches. Good privacy.<br />Con: It doesn't save your searches. You have to type the subject in every time you want to see it or use the &#34;Save page&#34; button in the menu.<br /><br />Pro: I love the collapsed-header view. I wish the online version was like this so I didn't have to scroll through pages of stuff to get to the part I want to read.<br />Cons: If you don't expand the header and read the section, you might miss something interesting.<br /><br />Pro: Free<br /><br />Okay, the &#34;Pros&#34; win. Get the app. :-)
B004TN7QPG|1.0|Not compatible with Nextbook Pro, or really any device without a hardwared-in Settings key. Without it you can't adjust anything: font size, text, even chapter breaks.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|I like it. Makes you think without knowing it. Puzzles are fun to try and solve and I like that you can quit whenever you want.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|A rainbow of characters. An emotional step by step read. I walked next to Harold all the way. Sometimes I slowed, sometimes I upped the pace, sometimes I laughed, sometimes I cried.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games can be a bit difficult to get to but you really add up the points once you get harder games.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|It's been a long time since I actually loved the entire cast of a comedy show (SOAP might have been the last time, that was back in the late 70's), after watching season one I completely understand the popularity of this show.  It is funny, with great characters from everyone on the cast. I love the interaction, storylines, dark humor. I will continue to watch all seasons to know more about these three diverse families.
1594204217|5.0|Michael Pollan is a wonderful read, and makes nutrition understandable to me.  Although I don't agree with EVERYTHING he says, I enjoy reading his books.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|This movie was not what I expected. I thought it was going to be childish and cheesy but it was actually very fun to watch
B000OV85AW|4.0|The DVD arrived promply and in perfect condition.  I've not yet watched it, so don't know if the fidelty is also perfect - I hope so.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Expected a conclusion not for it to be drug out for another two books!  What a disappointment in the book and author.
B0043RSK3K|5.0|Libertarians hold the belief that the state is, at its core, a predatory institution that derived in the long ago from roving bandit gangs who, at some point, realized it would be easier and more profitable to become stationary bandits. Settling down and plundering little by little throughout the year, stationary bandits are less likely to kill and destroy as they loot you and fend off rival bandits. This is some kind of improvement, even from the perspective of those being plundered. Untold History serves to bolster that theory, and is likely to dash any hopes or illusions one might have about what it really means to be a citizen of \\"the greatest country on earth.\\"<br /><br />I am somewhat the average citizen. I consider myself intelligent, well-rounded and educated, but have never had an inordinate interest in politics or history, except to make myself go to the polls and cast my vote, as any respectable citizen should do. I am only half way through this book and already realize, I am a dupe, a victim. No different from the victims of old. The bandits are indeed still here, they are the powerful and wealthy who own and run this country. Alas, my only purpose is to produce wealth while takers appropriate it.<br /><br />Accounts of the maniacal and self-serving lunatics who have run this country through most of its history, will shock, as you learn how more than a few of them have brought mankind to the brink of destruction for personal gain and the implementation of their own skewed agendas.<br /><br />Small threads of hope do permeate this accounting. From time to time, individuals emerge, who seem to have common sense and a true desire to serve the public. The 2oth century's Henry Wallace comes to mind. Unfortunately, they are always outnumbered and overwhelmed by the establishment, thereby dashing any illusions that the act of voting has any meaning at all.<br /><br />The first reaction I get from people when they find out I'm reading this book is usually, \\"Oh...Oliver Stone. That Whacko!\\" While Oliver does seem to have his biases, this book appears thoroughly researched and well documented. I caught a few minutes of Stone's companion video series and found it to be massively boring. Not so the book. It's uncharacteristic of me to describe a history book, especially a tome of this scope, as a \\"page turner,\\" but indeed it is.<br /><br />Sadly, Untold history has shocked me into a state of futile hopelessness, and pulled back the curtain to reveal the world of illusion the rich and powerful strive mightily to keep me in. Should you read Untold History? If you want the short version of reality, boot up the YouTube videos of George Carlin's last few HBO specials. If you want a horrifying step-by-step account of the truth as it has been served up to you. Untold History is a must-read.
B00846REIS|5.0|Didn't like it more than 50 shades but liked the story line.  Eager to see where the next ones go.
B000QY9WOU|5.0|So real and this woman knows how to put on a show.  I love her in concert, she gives 100%.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Fast paced, interesting story line, to good to put down, fast read, keeps your interest, waiting for book number three
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Great game, morbid but awesome. Xpacs were a little pricey but we'll worth it. Replay value is huge and the achievements are funny as all hell. Good stuff guys, I hope to see more from you.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|I purchased the Mighty Eagle bundle for this. The starship does not work like the Mighty Eagle in regular Angry Birds. I have reached a point where I can't move on because the starship does not take out all the bad guys like the Mighty Eagle in Angry Birds does.
B0014CDKVY|5.0|being able to get the movie @ local stores was proving impossible, so we ordered the movie and watched it within 60 seconds.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my son and he is constantly listening to it.  I have to say I like it too.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This  ha  to be  the best game in the Amazon Appstore  the controls are really good and there I  even a multiplayer mode best game ever.
B0015AARJI|3.0|The old stop working after two years, bought as a replacement controller.  Works fine, the PS3 is smaller controller than xbox, fits in you hand better.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Love the app both me and my son play this together and then I play with out him lol the music is really cute too
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Product was as seen in the pictures and just what i ordered. Arrived as expected, no problems. Very nice Thank you
B0085YOD1A|4.0|okay so I got this because it was the free app of the day unknowing what it would do! but when I got it ... I loved it! it told you how much longer you had on your device and the exact percentage in your notifications so you should get this it is awesome :):)
B00AA0U05A|5.0|I first heard Emmy on some morning show singing a song from her Sentimental Journey CD. I thought what a refreshing voice she has. I just hope people will listen to it, you don't see her name flashing everywhere. This is a great CD.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|almost like having the real thing. lots of fun. graphics are quite realistic. if you missed out on having a horse you can now have this.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This is the best free weather app I've found so far for my kindle. I've used weather.com for a while, but found it didn't work very well and was looking for something better. I found it here!
B0095J0AL6|5.0|THE BONUS TRACKS ARE AMAZING!! I LOVE IT<br />but i wish there were the other Japanese tracks like magic &#60;3 any way i love it!!
B006T75DUU|5.0|A must read for this day and age of mercurial commitments, loss and global anxiety. A good read on a road trip.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|My daughter's love this game.  They love to do every single step every time.  I even enjoy dressing them up too....opens up imaginative play outside the game as well.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This was a great book.  Great hearing it from a childs prospective.  Makes you think of things you take for granted.
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|Grandbabies love this app and of course, all of us adults get a good laugh out of it also, great stress reliever.
B00BSBU4EC|3.0|A great message about imagination, but I'm not sure how I feel about telling our kids what their imagination should be. The tough and almost realistic nature of the characters tends to reduce the innocence of our children in my opinion.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love playing this game....its very fun to play. I'm addicted to it. I would tell anyone<br />to play this game.
B00957T6X6|5.0|This series is the most engrossing series of books I have ever read. It is a true life account of life's injustice and at the same time shows how karma wins long term all in a Tolkien esque setting
0316247545|5.0|I wasn't expecting much from this when I ordered it, but what arrived was AMAZING.  First, the blue part you see is a half dust Jacket, when removed it looks almost exactly like the actual book in the show.  THe first part of the book is a recreation of the show book telling the story of the two sisters and how the mare in the moon came to be.  After that is the character info which includes initial concept art and all kinds of details.  Add to that summaries of all the episodes and information on places and a MAP.  It is a bargain.  My nine year old daughter received this on Thursday, I had a lot of things to get done and about two hours into cleaning the kitchen I realized the house was quiet -- you know, the something is probably wrong quiet?  Nope, she had been curled up on the couch, TV off, game system off, reading this book.  She is going cover to cover and is about halfway through it now.  This is a SOLID hardcover with all the information anyone who loves this show would adore.  I am recommending it to all my daughter's friends who like MLP:FiM as well as MY friends that adore the show.  While a child can read it, even the adult fan will appreciate all the information in this
B008JJM88Q|5.0|This is a lot of fun by yourself or with friends. Try to find a person he can't guess is addicting. Our whole family has this app and we all love it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|its kinda annoying when it wont update like 4 to 8 days after Apple does and it just so irratiating
B004N6369Y|5.0|This book just touched my heart it and I enjoyed every minute reading it, recommending it to all my friends to read
1416955070|2.0|I was very disappointed with the romantic story line of this book. There was some romantic tension built up in it, but it could have been so much better if more had been developed around this part of the story line. Instead it was kind of haphazardly ignored, as if a teenage girl Clary's age would be so totally oblivious to a bad ass, smoking hot guy like Jace.<br /><br />I was also very disappointed in how the author chose to wrap up the book as well. What was basically a twist at the end of the plot was something I had already figured out by about halfway through the book about them. I won't spoil it here by saying what happens, but since the romantic interest in this book was about the only thing that kept me reading through the plot line which fairly well dragged and stalled out in multiple places, I was pretty hacked off by the way the romantic twist ended up.
B005UG542S|4.0|I continue to be an avid fan and plan to have a Harry Potter movie day party with my grandchildren in the near future.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Already seen the movie but this was better. Such amazing detail. I read this while camping in the mountains and found myself often imagining being in the Games.
B0085YOD1A|3.0|Is an ok app I mostly use it to see how much battery I have left. There's nothing really special about it
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Amazing, moving, inspiring! It has everything: supreme performances, outstanding visual effects, and most important of all, a life changing story.
B00992CF6W|5.0|MINECRAFT IS SO AWESOME GET THIS APP SO COOL WORTH $6.99<br />IF I WERE TO PICK A APP TO BE MY ONLY APP IT WOULD BE MINECRAFT<br />BEST APP EVER GET PLEASE :)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Love how the book manage to surprise you until the very end. Gripping and beautifully tied together with reader looking forward to possible follow ups.
B008GXHOFW|2.0|Graphics were good, but steering control was terrible. Issues with directional control, issue with simple as asserting. Walking was easier that rebalancing because directionally it was practically impossible to get from point a to point b without being turned around.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Creative and soothing, this app allows you to tailor make your meditation or sleep sounds.  I really enjoy it immensely.
B0000070QN|5.0|I have been very happy with all the Harem Scarem albums I've purchased and this one is no exception. The first track is very good and there are many other songs on this album which really help get me motivated during workouts.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|This is a really fun & smart new take on the Sherlock Holmes world.  Set in NYC today, Sherlock is fresh from rehab with helpful guidance from Joan Watson.  He consults for the NYPD & brilliantly deduces whodunnit every time!  Although it does not meet the same high standard set by the BBCs \\"Sherlock\\" series, Elementary is fun viewing & worth your time.
B00BXVKKPA|4.0|Not as good as the original self titled album, but it has a couple good rhythm songs that are enjoyable to listen to.
B000FBJHZS|5.0|Great book, one of my favorites.  I read this years ago, got it again, loved it again.  One of a kind!
B00870ZH3U|5.0|I absolutely love this.  The growth of the characters of Raoul and Madame Giry into such bitter people was surprising..Love the music, Under a moonless night is beautifully crafted.
B000ZOW96Y|2.0|This story was weak. And it felt like everyone phoned this in. I would not recommend this one or any future oceans movies.
B0088W6IMQ|2.0|Contrived plot,  stock characters, weak dialogue, muddled script, stilted acting, boring pretty much sums up my impressions.  In truth, I only made it about halfway through before abandoning the whole thing.  How did the producers allow this to get the go-ahead?
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|The only reason I watch this movie was because I love Leslie Mann. And she does not disappoint. Paul Rudd is kind of funny.
B000007UTN|5.0|This is the record that separated Radiohead from the countless other \\"Alternative\\" rock bands of the 90's. Their previous and excellent record in it's own right \\"The Bends\\"; hinted at the bands forward thinking. But OK Computer took them to a whole other level!<br />A miserable masterpiece full of emotion & passion that will take the listener on a journey as you begin to get drawn into a record that changed the soundscape of music as we know it!
B000RLFJQ2|5.0|Deniro phones it in.  The Irish girl is excellent.  Very beautiful.<br />Apparently I need another nine words for this review. Seriously Amazon knock it off. You should have a review system closer to Netflix
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I was looking for a calculator that were both, useful. and easy and after trying many I fount this application and I really like it. :)
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|This movie surprised me because the trailers for it looked really cheesy. I thought it was laughable they were trying to make a short middle-age man into some sort of 80s action star type tough guy. But it really was pretty good I enjoyed the movie quite a bit. I think it is worth renting to watch.
B00BMR5HOO|4.0|Not bad, quite simple, but it does not seem to use up a lot of resources in my tablet and graphics are good.
B0013KTGAG|5.0|I love everything about this movie except the injection of some horror elements. I'm kind of getting sick of sci-fi movie producers and directors thinking that they have to put crap like that into a story but I guess otherwise movies would not sell
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love this book it was amazing!!!! I enjoyed it and can't wait for the 4th and 5th boom in this series!!!!!
B005LJITS0|4.0|I like a lot of things right Reynolds is then. And this movie is no exception. I think they could've done a better job with the suits. And the story needed a little more punch.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Very different from the normal stories.  I like it alot.  It has a lot adventure and actiton pack.  This one is a keeper
B005HE5J7I|5.0|For those who love history and for those who don't, this is a great novel to learn about London. Mr. Rutherford really engages you will all of his interesting characters throughout the course of the novel, and at the same time, he teaches you  the history of the place. Although at times, it can be difficult to keep track of the relationships of the characters, you can always refer to the reference guide at the beginning of the novel. Above all, he wants us to realize that history is more about people than events. Enjoy!
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Disney did it again for me.  I like this movie alot.  It is a keeper.  I definitely want to own this movie.  It's one for the collection.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I was hesitant seeing this movie because I thought it would be too violent.<br />There were some scenes I had to close my eyes due to the violence but a lot of them were funny violence if there is such a thing.<br />I think this was one of the best movies of the year!  Great love story and suspense
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show I love the setting and how the actor make me think they are in early 1900&#34;s and in England for real.  I'm hooked.  I&#34;m up to date on all the series and recommend this show to all my friends.  I got a couple of my friends hook as well.  I can't wait for next season to come out. I love the history but I love how they new their place but care about each other lives.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A great game good graphics and teaches you responsibility. Easy to get gems and you can be with your friends get and give gifts.Totally safe no real talking to people.<br /><br />  10 year old .Makayla
B00785P2QC|5.0|It's ok but it should add things. It is very addicting once you play you can't stop like me I got home the other day and I couldn't stop playing. Besides that it pretty fun.
0857898388|5.0|The great polemicist Christopher Hitchens turns his attention to Agnes Bojaxhiu, aka Mother Teresa, in this searing look into her work that is universally accepted as humanitarian and above reproach. Hitchens presents an image of Teresa that is highly critical of her reputation in this brilliantly argued book on her life's work.<br /><br />Hitchens recounts Teresa's relationships with known dictators such as the Haitian dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier and his wife Michele who all but bankrupted their country and fled to France. Teresa, despite supposedly caring for the poor, does little for them - she demands that they accept their lot and live with poverty rather than try to help them escape it. This is a woman whose fame rests upon her help with the poor, and yet she failed to use her power and influence to alleviate their suffering by encouraging the many world leaders she met to work on this issue.<br /><br />But she's not political! you say, as she claimed many times herself. And yet she often involved herself in politics, especially when it came to the subject of abortion. She travelled to Spain to protest when post-Franco legislation was to be passed regarding the legalisation of divorce, abortion, and birth control, and even spoke to Margaret Thatcher about passing a bill that was in the House of Commons that wanted to limit the availability of abortions.<br /><br />Teresa was a fond one for abortion (despite being a virgin and not knowing anything about what it's like to give birth, and sex, besides the end product) and made it the subject of her speech when she won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 (a win that remains questionable as to what she actually contributed to world peace or peace in any single country), claiming that abortion was the biggest threat to mankind.<br /><br />Maybe the biggest criticism of Mother Teresa above all is the way she and her order withheld painkillers from the very sick and dying. In a filmed interview, she recounted an exchange she had with a cancer patient who was dying, who she refused to give painkillers to, where she said \\"You are suffering like Christ on the cross. So Jesus must be kissing you\\", to which the person replied \\"Then please tell him to stop kissing me\\". Teresa, it seems, was unaware of the irony of that comment. Also, her Homes for the Dying are run by nuns who aren't medically trained or know anything about palliative care, or even basic hygiene as they wash medical equipment in cold tapwater rather than sterilise them!<br /><br />Hitchens also raises the question of what Teresa did with the millions she received in donations. There will never be an audit because it's the Catholic Church but given the basic requirements of her homes, it seems likely that a lot of it didn't go into helping the poor. And a lot of the donations came from questionable sources like Charles Keating, a fraud who was imprisoned for 10 years for his part in the Savings and Loans scandal in the early 90s. He donated $1.25 million to Mother Teresa who wrote a character reference to the judge when he was on trial. It had no effect but the co-prosecutor of the case, Paul Turley, wrote back explaining to her why he was on trial, informing her that the money she had received was stolen from ordinary, hard working people who're now poor people like the ones she tries to help, and that she should return it on basic principle. He never received a reply to his letter and the money was not refunded.<br /><br />Teresa comes across as a PR tool for the Catholic Church and a political pawn, willingly used for the Church's own dogmatic ideas and as a fundraising figure. Hitchens has written a fascinating book in \\"The Missionary Position\\" which rightly questions a person long held to be untouchable because of her work and yet whose actions remain highly dubious and contradictory. \\"The Missionary Position\\" is a highly recommended and thought-provoking read.<br /><br />Also worth checking out is Hitchen's documentary on Mother Teresa, Hell's Angel. The first half of this book is basically a retelling of the documentary. It's available for free on Youtube.ry on Mother Teresa, Hell's Angel. The first half of this book is basically a retelling of the documentary. It's available for free on Youtube.

Btw, if someone has a link to it, I'd really appreciate that.
B0085YOD1A|2.0|I neither saw nor experienced any redeeming qualities of this app that my OS didn't already do for me.  This lasted 38 seconds on my Xoom, which was more than enough time to try it, score it and was deleted.

B009JVSAVM|5.0|That is a fun part of my day. I watch it every night, when I get home from my second shift work, before go to sleep and in the morning. It is stresses relive remedy.
B008KP6ENE|3.0|the game needs more work overall its a good concept side scrolling game but the controls are just a little wack and I feel like this game is way too slow for me. The graphics are good though.
B00COGZ8FU|1.0|Far fetched, lame, ridiculous, phony, fake, hated it. Renting it for 4.99 was 4.99 too much!  Save your money and see something else!
B009MF56GC|5.0|This is has all star that I love to see. It is better than previous one. Great price too. Hope they will come out part 3.
B002BFIN6K|5.0|I bought this Cd brand new on Amazon. It arrived in excellent condition.<br /><br />I already have the normal tracks which I bought on HD Tracks, but did not have the binaural tracks.<br />Great performance - love it!
B009CPJHY4|4.0|This film is a perfect mix of great scenery, intertwining and interdependent relationships and wonderful acting. Where else can you visit a fascinating place, meet complex people who pack their emotional baggage with care and go on a life adventure and end up sharing some great life truths with us, the audience, in the process? Well done all around!
B001R10BEG|5.0|Classic.... that says it all. Tom Hanks at his best.<br /><br />Wish I too could be a kid again for a few days.... call it &#34;Small&#34; then? :)
B00821OX98|3.0|I kept thinking, &#34;Why didn't the 2nd Mass just do this or do that?&#34; Oh, but then the series would end too soon.  Other than plot problems, the acting was good and the special effects believable.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is the best this game is for you if you like horses when I got this horse I didn't play with it that much now love i love it totally recommend this game
B008KP6ENE|2.0|This is an amazing game, however, the controls are very glitchy on my HTC One X. It will work great for the first few seconds of a level, and then will stop working. I tried both styles of joysticks, and neither worked correctly. I was also unable to jump while running, not sure if that is how it is supposed tp be or not. I absolutely love the style of game, and graphics are wonderful. Please fix the controls glitch, so I can enjoy this game!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book. I thought I'd be bored just because I was impatient to know who the letters were to, but I just pretended they were all to me and I fell right in. Such a wonderful novel.
B0058W74UY|3.0|It might be nice to not need Flash to view websites, but in the real world you do. The needed extensions should be included in build of Linux used in the Kindle Fire not as an add on. I realize it is not really Adobe Flash, but a Linux knock off, all the more reason to not have ads.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Covers an important period. Beautifully acted, written, and staged. Was a little confused by Robert's affair with the maid. Seemed a bit of an artifact but all's well that ends well.
B006TJXZ30|1.0|It never worked for me. I removed it from my device. Not recommended for Kindle Fire users. The generic Android like mail app works, but just not very well. The Hotmail app didn't work at all.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Never played the others...just loved this!!!  Have to get the others now.  Could not stop playing.  I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes a little thinking with their games.  Took cute.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|The Kindle Fire is all new to me, but when I found out about Mahjong I have been hooked.  They say you are never to old to learn, but I am proving them wrong, ( I am 83) and just love my Kindle.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|What's not to love, it is a great movie. Brings back childhood memories and who doesn't love the truffle shuffle
B009R659L8|3.0|Suspenseful, but not MHC's finest, because it is very predictable, unlike her usual unseen twists.  It is a quick and easy read.
B008476HBM|5.0|I fell in love with the movie from the first time I saw it. Now that I have read the book, I understand so much of what happened in the movie.<br />This book is sweet and I love how innocent it is. I would recommend it to anyone who is tired of today's perverse society, to those who are tired of reading and watching stories that are filled with sex and violence...
B00340ESIS|5.0|This book takes highfalutin ideas about how to write screenplays and makes them quickly and easily understandable. Its author, Blake Snyder, based his ideas on his own successful forays into the world of Hollywood and told them in a way that everyone could grasp. Not only that he made his book a fun read! I highly recommend it.
B009X2CRMK|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  I loved the way the 3 generations all wrapped together! The storyline was completely believable and an amazing insight into the way things happened in the past and how it can affect the future.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|A perfect summertime read when reading heavy, serious books has worn you out.  Thoroughly enjoyable, chapter by chapter!  Looking forward to the next one!
B0043WDK2G|5.0|Castle is one of the best shows on TV.  I love all the cast and think the chemistry is great.
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|Alot of action and very fast paced. Falls wright into all the others. You won't be dispointed.. Movie strongly suggested
B005O7PXNS|5.0|I think castle is well written,  Funny at times and serious at other times.  I love all the shows.  Love the whole cast.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|Totally worth every penny! All the songs are unique, beautiful, and I can't decide which one is my favorite. Will buy more from this artist.
B0049DRH28|5.0|Bad ass, Steampunk Classic, straight up .A must have as the genre develops.<br />An environment that allows cover, for a greater discussion in regards to, the dynamic tension between government and man.
B003FL4O9E|3.0|Nostalgia late 80's movie to make us feel good about where we are now!  It was shortly after this movie, producers realized it was easier to animate characters into movies vs elaborate costumes.  Your kids will not be impressed.
B008OM0EDO|5.0|Funny.  Learn to laugh at uncomfortable moments before you watch.  Some pubic hair and dick jokes felt familiar from borat/etc.  Still lots of fresh feeling stuff to amuse me.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I love this movie.  I love the books too.  I can't wait until the new one comes out this winter.
B0083Z614S|4.0|This is an absolute read for inspiration, friendship and compassion.  Loved it!!!! Makes me want to enhance my surroundings with a lovely garden!!!!
B0037VNX44|5.0|It's an entertaining movie throughout... The humor caught me off guard, but also kept me watching. Tom Hardy is brilliant in this role.
B009CF3P7E|5.0|A new version for another generation.  A different course.  Makes me wonder what the next generation's will be like?  :)
B001GKJ2DY|4.0|Loved it! Such fun music! Brosnan was a mistake as a singer, but loved Meryl!! It is just a happy movie!
B00BN3EE1O|4.0|He is one of my favorite authors. His stories have so much detail in them. It is a shame that so much good stuff gets edited out to fit in a time frame. To me it seems some of the best parts of this wonderful story are missing.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I thought this book would be about the American that limped home in a bomber that was shot up so bad it should not have been flying.  It was really about that the German that chose not to finish him off when he very easily could have.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Great app, plain and simple! The \\"test drive\\" feature was instrumental in my choice to purchase, so try it for yourself. It appears that I picked up up at the right time as other reviews from pre-Dec. 2012 mention a few glitches. I use it for my Kindle Fire and haven't experienced any problems with looping, the timer, etc. I use the app just about every day.
B004XIZN5M|5.0|I've spent years looking for a work-out routine that A. didn't take tons of time, B. didn't require much in the way of equipment, C. Was not limited to specific locations, and D. didn't kill my joints in the process of getting into shape. Years ago, I tried Jack Lalane's workout regimen, but lacked the discipline to stick with it. This system uses similar exercises (bodyweight, little equipment), but is much more regimented and uses progressive training methods to increase difficulty and resistance. I've been doing it for about three weeks now, and I've already noticed improvements in my strength, musculature, and energy levels. I'm still in the &#34;settling-in&#34; phase of determining what schedule/angles are best for my body type, but I'm highly impressed with the routine. I don't consider myself a weakling, but I was shocked by how difficult it was to do even the basic exercises using perfect form and timing. Even so, my reps are increasing steadily, and I'm about to move to the second level of exercises for three of the &#34;big six&#34; movements. I highly, HIGHLY recommend this book and this exercise routine for anyone who is interested in gaining massive amounts of functional, USEFUL strength. You may not get bulky, but if Paul Wade's promises hold true, you'll be stronger than any bodybuilder, regardless of size. I especially recommend this book for police, military, and anyone who wants to get strong but lacks time or access to use a gym or the money to buy weights or machines. The one thing I advise you is patience; it takes time to get results, but the time spent is well worth it.
0446547654|5.0|Another great book from Nicholas! Share this with your friends and anyone who likes novels. I have to type 5 more words?
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Loved this story! It had mystery, great sex, humor and beautiful romance. The characters are very likable. I am eagerly awaiting the next book!!
1609611543|4.0|The subject had me intrigued at first. The book was way too technical. I kept wanting it to get to the point. What can and can't you eat, how,what,where and when. I continue to enjoy this type of eating.
0385737955|5.0|Absolutely Stunning. I finished this book on first day I started reading it. It had me hooked from the very first chapter. Dashner did a stupendous job giving a little here and a little there to keep you wanting so much more! The second I stopped reading I immediately ordered the second book. I absolutely recommend, no doubt about it...GET THIS BOOK!
B00A7W29BE|4.0|I down loaded it just to have, and recently needed to send a receipt to someone.  It actually works quite well.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|best tool app I've downloaded, easy to use. I also got this app for free, so double awesome. :) two more
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I COULD NOT stop playing this game.  It was just challenging enough without being frustrating. The graphics were beautifully done.
B003IWRE3I|4.0|This is a troubling film, about a man and his son, who try to survive after a nuclear war has devastated the world. There are lawless gains, hopelessness and cannibalism. For those reasons, it is not a family movie, nevertheless, it presents a shocking reality for such a time.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This is excellent if you are using your Android device while using recipes from your favourite e-cookbooks. On my old Kindle device, which I still use for reading and is still excellent, I could never see the photos in their technicolour glory in my Kindle cookbooks. Now I can browse for recipes and let myself be seduced and instructed by the lovely photos. Works perfectly.
0316067598|5.0|buy this book you wont be sorry ! I Like good books in hard cover like this one over soft glad i bout it in hard cover.
B00D2ZF3GQ|4.0|As a reader of many Sci-Fi titles, and an avid follower of the genre on the big screen, I can say that it is very hard to produce something that is impressive from a visual/technical point of view, while still maintaining character depth and overall credibility.<br /><br />The movie progressed at a good pace, I felt Will Smith's acting was not exaggerated and too emotional as in his previous movies. Jaden Smith succeeded in creating empathy for the character.<br /><br />The general impression for me was that the movie was a very sound in the scientific sense of the word. A thousand years from now does seem like a reasonable time for the human race to exit the boundaries of earth, unlike \\"2001, A Space Odyssey\\", which missed the mark, or Smith's own \\"I, Robot\\", which predicted walking and talking robots by the year 2035.<br /><br />But the real strength of the film comes in the lesson it teaches the viewers, where sometimes we are afraid of fear itself, and that letting go of these boundaries makes us invincible.<br />aI felt, though, that the movie was a bit short, and that perhaps there should be a sequel (in the recent sequel spirit that washes the theatres) that let's us know what becomes of the war between the human race and the aliens.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Fast game and very fun. Would purchase it again. Add to my favs on computer too. so have on 2 devices.
B004ELSDZK|5.0|Great game for anybody looking for a logic break in their day.  The instructions were a little vague but it didn't take long to get the hang of.  I like the flexible levels so that if you a are stuck on one you can skip it move on and come back to it.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Have been on pinterest on line and just happy that I can check it out on my kindle fire. S o many thing to check out on pinerest
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|Reminded me of a new age horrorish beauty and the beast, but with zombies. It was awesome, I'd tell you to give it a try.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|This is one of the most amazing books I've ever read! Could not put it down! I will be downloading more of Kinsella' s books for sure! Worth every penny!!
B000W93CHC|5.0|If you saw the mini series and liked it, be ready for a surprise.  The book is much better and I was amazed at the liberties the makers of the mini series took with the story line.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very fun game. It only lasted a couple hours but I really did enjoy it. The puzzles are fun and rewarding. I highly recommend and look forward to the next iteration.
B000I8ERVC|3.0|This movie was a hit when it was released, but I just didn't quite get it.  Was fun to see Peter Fonda, Jack Nicholson, and Dennis Hopper in their younger days.  Never much cared for Karen Black, tho.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I needed something to remind me for quick / short periods of time. This works GREAT!  I\\" m sure you'll like it too.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|In true fashion, this installment of this steamy love story delivers heart thumping drama and hot sex scenes. Cannot wait for the next book to see where these lovers take us next.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Very technical but extremely human....<br />Amazing how one can think out a problem and come up with a solution.<br />There are always alternatives....
B005HEFB6M|5.0|I'm not going to review the shows content since most people who will watch it are already very familiar with the Star Trek franchise. I watched the season on my PC which consist of a quality video card behind a quad CPU going to a 26&#34; hi-def display and a decent sound bar with sub woofer for audio. The streaming from Amazon through Amazon Prime is very good most of the time. On occasion the quality will drop off and usually requires a page refresh to regain the hi-def quality feed. I have yet to determine if that problem is at Amazons server or at the service from my local cable company. Either way the issue isn't enough to cause any real problem with the viewing experience.
B001NHNG64|5.0|With Independence Day just around the corner this is a must read. Great action novel and Jack Reacher at his finest
B000OCXFCO|5.0|Heavy, Fast, angry, political, ect.  Dave has found himself here, Im glad his back and doing what he loves. \\" I know you can hear me\\"
B001HQZJPM|5.0|My husband was dying to have this triology because he is a big Mummy fan and we watch the movie whenever it comes on TV.  Now he doesn't have to wait for it to come on so he can watch it whenever he wants.  He loves it.
B00COGY2P2|3.0|Just a fun, exciting flick...Cruise is perfect for the role; but no Academy award for sure. Wouldn't have paid $10 to see it in the mall but worth $5 at home to watch with the family.
B008MEM24S|4.0|I initially shelled out the 99 cents :) for my kid but then it turned out being me who played for the first few day. Once my 5 year old got his hands on it he was having a blast with this game. He likes Phineas and Ferb so this game was even more fun for him.
B008B0UIVW|4.0|Very much enjoyed this read, it had me giggling out loud on a number of occasions! A good, light-hearted read!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this gaame I teaches you how to train and take care of a horse or horses and that is why I gave it fixed stars
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Even though the climax of films had already been out to the viewing public for a while, The Hobbit did not disappoint.  The Dwarves are more handsome in this one, though.
B00821OX98|5.0|So happy to see Noah Wyle back on TV. The entire ensemble cast meshes well. I highly recommend you catch up on this show before season three begins.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I knew what I was in for with this book, as so many of my girlfriends had raved about it.  However, after reading halfway through the book, I found myself bored and quit reading it.
B00D5O7BPU|4.0|It is cool and I am already addicted to it but it needs the ppsh-41, the mosin nagant, and the Springfield. Other than that it is much better than any gun game I have played.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Each book in the Crossfire series by Sylvia Day captures me, pulls me into the story, and takes me on an unexpected journey with the characters.  I never know what will come next or how the characters will act and react.  Entwined With You was not as emotionally heart-wrenching as Reflected In You, but it is another excellent novel, beautifully written, and it left me wanting more.<br /><br />Entwined With You picks up right where Reflected ended.  Eva is reeling from learning the truth behind Gideon's withdrawal and struggling to work it all out in her head and heart.  Eva and Gideon are very much in love, addicted to each other, and they are finally learning to trust each other.  I love that both Eva and Gideon have grown, they are no longer slaves to their insecurities, but their choices are questionable at times.  Because of the fall-out from Gideon's actions in Reflected, they have to keep their relationship secret.  The dynamic between them is still hot and erotically charged, but they function better as a couple.  It is odd though, in a sense, because they are not public with their relationship.  They keep their relationship from everyone and that felt a little weird to me.<br /><br />So much takes place in Entwined With You.  After I finished the book, I needed some time to process it all.  Entwined is packed full of events, choices, and secrets.  Just when it seems like one problem is being laid to rest, another major event or problem arises.  I was ecstatic for Gideon and Eva at some places in this book, but then confused by their secrets an actions a few pages later.  While the couple seems to be in a better place, I have concerns for what will come next for them, how the secrets they have could hurt them.<br /><br />Entwined With You answers a lot of questions.  I love that the questions were answered, but new problems are rising up, and I have concerns about Eva's lingering insecurities.  Eva and Gideon's story has already been a roller-coaster of a ride, and there is so much more to come.  There are two more books to come in this series, and I can not wait to see what twists and turns are next for Gideon and Eva.<br /><br />The Crossfire series is a must-read series for contemporary erotic romance readers.  This series is beautifully written, Sylvia Day is a master story-teller.  I recommend that the books be read in order though, the relationships and characters grow with each book, it is important to read from the beginning.  Thank you Sylvia Day for delivering another amazing story!e, and there is so much more to come.

0307887448|5.0|This book had an extremely slow beginning for me, I mean I put the book down half way through Chapter two and had to convince myself that &#34;I can do it&#34;. Thank goodness I did, after I made it through that chapter I was hooked. Suddenly I was invested in Wade Watts life and thought about what was going to happen next while I was working. It brought my inner geek out to play and I loved that about the book. A whole new way of looking at a virtual reality and a page turner.<br /><br />I'd gladly recommend this book.
B0050DIWHU|5.0|As an established business person in retirement I found the book valid in so many ways. It makes it clear that the ROI for and investment in social networking is that your business  will survive down the line. Reid Hoffman knows and has been down this road himself. Good operational information and fun to read.
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|I love the amazon app on my tablet. I use it to search for what I need to buy or compare online prices.
B002PEP4U0|5.0|I bought this one because I am interested in wind power for the guest house we are hosting in Haiti,  I was hoping for some clues about small scale wind power.  I got a lot of that kind of thing and in addition I got a fascinating story of growing up in a small farming community in Africa.  Loved the book.
0143122061|3.0|The book is tendentious and disorganized. The author is highly enamaoured of his own opinions and his turns of phrase, and much less concerned with balance or accuracy. I thought I was buying a history. This is actually an essay; an argument. It has so many holes, and the use of facts and examples is so selective, that the argument does not succeed.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This was a great HO game. Absolutely loved it! Kept my interest till the very end. With clever puzzle and dark storyline,  I give it 2 thumbs up!!
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|I have always loved the Die Hard movies as they were a favorite of mine growing up- watching them with my father. I was so looking forward to this one and wouldn't listen to my boyfriend telling me how horrible it was. About half way through though, I turned it off. I was utterly disappointed with it and couldn't even finish. I get that Bruce Willis is older (which I also wouldn't admit at first) and can't do the stunts he was once able to do, but the acting! Oh my goodness, the bad acting! It was terrible by all parties. I really hope this is the last installment as I think they should have just left the classics alone. The fourth was maybe enough, but the fifth just went too far.
0345529057|5.0|These books are hard to put down.  Interesting characters that pull you in and make you want to know how it's going to end.
B001K3EXTA|5.0|A great loves story with a Shakespearian tragic hero in Gatsby.  Wanted to see again before the new one is out
B00A9T1HUO|3.0|Not up[ to the level of some cd's I've enjoyed by Josh Groban.  Several songs were standouts, but most were just<br />so-so.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I soo enjoyed reading the other books. But this one just left me bored. I like it we there is action and angry with this couple. It was just the same thing over and over.Even the wedding was boring. We keep circling when we really need to land this one
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|This book was supposed to wrap it all up and it deserved a well written ending. Instead we got a whole book about a whole lot of nothing. Half of the book is about how impossibly handsome Gideon is and she doesn't understand how he is hers. The other half I'd describing the buildings she goes to that are owned by Gideon and they are just like him. Guess what I don't care, this story could have been so much more. It took so long for the release and after so long they decide to release this, I would have sent Silvia back home with her book about everything and asked her to write an actual good book. She is just in for the money, which there is nothing wrong with that if you are going to give us a good story, but not make us pay for something like this. She gave us a little of everything and not what the book was supposed to be about. I feel like she did not know what to write about and stretched it out until she thinks about a good story not buying any more books from her .
B009CVILU4|5.0|I loved this book so much that I wanted to own the hard copy.<br /><br />Thank you for providing such an amazing product.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Although the book itself is long, it is very engrossing, and well worth the read.  Especially if you've only watched the series, this offers a phenomenal insight into all the workings of Westeros
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|I have not seen this movie yet, but looked on Amazon, as I usually do, to get other opinions of it. I cannot believe the extensive bickering, fussing, fuming, childish crabbing, and whining about the DVD format or lack of 2d vs 3d discs, etc., etc., etc., so as to bring the rating of the movie itself down to a majority one star rating. Very few saw fit to mention the movie itself.<br /><br />  C'mon, people, HOW WAS THE MOVIE?????.<br /><br />Even though I have not as yet viewed the \\"Oz\\" remake, I am giving it five stars to offset the many one star ratings given it, due only to the format, price, etc.<br /><br />R.E.W.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Love that they are wireless<br />excellent sound quality<br />use them everyday<br />only had them for a short while but no problems so far
B00555X8OA|5.0|I absolutely enjoy this work. I have been deliberating the epistemological duality of our cognitive modalities for many years. Dr. Kahneman's lucid dissection and reconstitution of thought systems provides a seemingly exhaustive treatment of the delicate balance that must be negotiated between sensory cognition and deliberative cognition. The perspicuity with which he does so facilitates a conceptual framework for understanding thought processes that is engaging, provocative and retentive.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This is a cute and fun puzzle game!  Great animation and adorable puzzles... My kids like it also...  From the maker of cut the rope... Good follow up game...
B0089XH38M|5.0|Keep my phone safe. Each time I down load something it checks it out and lets me know if it is a good program or bad
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Awesome!!! The best in quality of sound, and I can hear my music anywhere! Along with music Cloud storage in Amazon.
B006WQLH7G|3.0|I tried it nothing wrong with it seem like a good program. I just like another one better. It's a matter of opinion.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|The graphics are good enough but the ease TO be kill should not be as easy because when you are getting excited you get kill
B00C7DGRL4|3.0|the story line was easy to follow although there were some confusing scenes.  it you miss any part of the story you will not be able to follow the script since the movie is nothing like the fairy tale.  Quite a few witches in the story (pretty and ugly).
B005CRQ4GU|2.0|WAS kind of slow moving and a little boring. Not as good as the other books In the series that's just my opinion though
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|I like it except that you should make riding horses easier than I it is and when you fly on creative you should be able to fly high not just a little. Anyone agree I do. You should have regular minecraft controllers instead of just the word: move. Aren't you guys coping a game I know of? Forget the name. Whateves you should also have more time to play out demo
B00992CF6W|5.0|This review will be extremely long. Warning you guys now, but I will put a TLDR at the end. Scroll to it if you don't feel like reading all this. I will be splitting this into three sections- Controls, Combat, and Gameplay. An extra section called Overall will be after them.  Controls- Minecraft on the console/computer has extremely good controls that are simply divine to use. (I'd argue that console has better controls, but I'm biased, I use consoles often.) This mobile version.. is a bit different. Now normally when you first get this game (for 7.00, which ill talk about later) the controls are set to a default button size, and sensitivity. If you have large thumbs like I do, the buttons are probably too small, and this will lead to massive frustration. Trust me, it will. You can fix this though! Simply go to settings and go to the controls tab (it looks like a controller, obviously) and fiddle with the settings until you find a setting you like. It's better to mess with sensitivity and button size ingame in my opinion. As for actual gameplay controls, to mine you press and hold a block to mine it and tap the screen to place blocks. The latter can be really frustrating, so I use split touch, to make my blocks go where I want them. Looking around might be a problem if your tablet glitches, since you drag the screen to look. tl;dr: Game controls have just a few easy to fix issues, and some may not even apply.  Combat- This game has a VERY simple (and I might even argue boring for older audiences) combat system that consists of the mighty concept of... tapping an enemy. That's it. There's no catch, unless you use a bow, in which case you press and hold the screen (away from a block, since a bug makes it so it'll break a block) until it's fully charged, aim, and fire. It's easy to kill crowds of enemies in minutes if you have a good enough sword on hand. Even then running away from most enemies, called &#34;mobs&#34;, can be easy, but not all. It's also possible to enchant items and armor, which can make you even more OP, but it requires a bunch of diamonds, obsidian, and lapis lazuli, along with getting your XP up to be able to place enchantments on items. tl;dr: Simple and honestly kind of boring combat, with an extra element added to make it more dull.  Gameplay- As of now, we don't have all the Minecraft game elements as the console- but it's likely being added in the near future. I'm talking stuff like the dimension besides the Nether, which is an underworld like dimension. It takes a bit of work to get there, but you can get some resources from there. Which is nice. The menu is also a bit of a problem, as it's split into 3 parts, but you'll get used to it. The game is split into 2 parts-Creative and Survival. Ill start with Survival.  Now, for the actual mainstream survival game, it's comprised mainly of building a shelter in the first few days, then building tools and mining to find resources, all the while battling enemies and making sure your hunger doesn't go down. In some difficulty modes you will die if your hunger drops completely. You can start a farm to raise animals like chickens, cows, and pigs for food later. I talked about shelter earlier. The ideal shelter in this game should be made out of explosion and fire resistant material, so using thick walls of rock should help. Add windows to shoot arrows from along with a roof with hatches for safety. This will make the game just a bit more interesting, especially on higher difficulties. Make a door as well, and protect it with extreme measures. Now, the whole game is comprised of adventure when you think of it. You create what you want in the game, make up a story as you go, really. This concludes the Survival subsegment. TLDR Can be a bit boring and tedious, but make up a story for fun if you want to.  Creative- I like this version more, and simply because you can do a bunch of fun stuff to the world without running out of blocks in the inventory. You get an unlimited amount of every block in the game, which allows you to destroy almost every wall of your imagination. No boundaries besides the blocks. Minecraft basically throws you into a world and says &#34;Go. Run free. Build or something, I dunno.&#34; My only problem is that the Redstone update isn't out yet (which is fine) so if you like Redstone circuitry, you'll need to stay on the other platforms for a bit. It'll take a few weeks to get here, I'm sure. Back to the point. Yes. You can do anything to the world- destroy the place with TNT (use a flint and steel to blow it up) and sit back and relax as you watch the world get destroyed. If you don't like demolition, you can build things. Build houses, cities, castles, your imagination and the blocks are the limit. TLDR This version let's you build and destroy whatever you'd like.  Overall: This game is really fun, but has a few problems like a flawed combat system and strangely laid out menus, along with a bug or two. I will still rate it 5 stars, since every update brings new surprises and who knows, the next update might bring something that will drop jaws everywhere. The 7.00 might seem like too much, but for what this has to offer its well worth it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It totally rocks  it is worth the money people who is with me? I think that it rocks:<br />A: it's cool<br />B: multiplayer and you can join games<br />C: it's totally sweet!
B00992CF6W|1.0|Amazon does not currently have new update.  Will not connect to tablets with update.  My son cannot update his game.  Update available at google play if you bought it from them.  Poor support from Amazon if update not available.
B0053JJLLC|3.0|I can't tell you how it ends, I couldn't finish this one. From one of my favorite authors too. Good luck
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This game is so fun! I would definitely recommend it you can die straighten shave curl and cut its like you have your own little salon me and my friend play it laugh at and compare our different designs!
B00992CF6W|5.0|i love this game so much if it were a girl i would marry her and have little minecraft babies
B00CW665VI|4.0|Very refreshing to have a romance novel from a man's point of view. The plot is basic but there is lots of  humor. I wonder if my boyfriend thinks like drew.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Just planted this year's crops, and needed an accurate temperature prediction to ensure they get covered if the temp dips. Easy to navigate, lots of customizable settings, and best of all accurate. The fact it's free is just the icing on the cake!
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love it. not as good as Pc but I heard they're coming out with an update to fix that. no buckets or fire or anything but the update came out today. just not for amazon apparently. I would love to get the update so I can have buckets and play online with other people!
B004SRNH10|2.0|I am unable to verify what this is actually used for.  I have it downloaded but no way of knowing when it is working and when it is not.<br />I use other apps to open PDFs.
B00BC24NT4|5.0|Like any true Le Carre fan, I miss the Smiley stories. But in Delicate Truth, Le Carre has applied his extraordinary sense of morality to our contemporary lives, and leaves us wondering what we would do in the situation described in this book. I found the book riveting and felt upon completion that it might be his best. George must have applauded it, too.
B007704HO6|4.0|this book read like a magazine story which was serialized.<br />I enjoyed it a lot but lost interest near the end and never finished the last 50 pages.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Not so difficult to be discouraged, but challenging enough to keep my interest. I'm looking forward to more levels to play.
B008D30K7E|4.0|I enjoyed this book and particularly liked how it linked the story with various world wide events and stories.<br />Scandanavian writers seems to be coming up with great books in recent years.<br />Great book and a good if improbable story !
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I am very disappointed with the ending like most of the other readers/comments.  There is not much more that I could say that hasn't already been said!
B00D2ZF3GQ|3.0|Will Smith averages one blockbuster per year. This time he's teamed with his son who is a chip off the old block(buster). Brace yourself!<br /><br />Scriptwriter Guillermo del Toro takes us to our planet 1,000 years after humans had to evacuate. Directed by M Night Shyamalan, this PG-13 thriller tells us that \\"Danger is Real, Fear is a Choice.\\" I'm not sure how I feel about THAT, but it proves to be a key factor in the survival of our two intrepid travelers. The critters who are the most deadly, can smell fear; if you can control your fear you become invisible to them.<br /><br />We admire:<br />  * Will Smith (\\"Hancock\\"), who commands a space ship that crash lands on our deserted planet. Desperately hurt, he must depend on his son to reach the tail section of the space ship, which had broken off during the crash. The beacon to summon help is in that debris.<br />  * Jaden Smith (\\"Karate Kid\\" 2010 ) is a young cadet (he wants to be a Ranger like his dad) who is tasked with a tough overland trek through dangerous terrain, nasty beasts, and hostile weather. Oh, and a dwindling reserve of supplies. He is frantic with fear.<br />  * Sophie Okonedo (Lots of BBC TV) is their lovely wife and mother; her sweetness and wisdom play perfectly here.<br />  * Zoë Kravitz (\\"X-Men: First Class\\") and yes, she's Lenny's daughter. Here she is daughter and sister to our heroes. She absolutely looks like a member of that family!<br /><br />This is basically a two-man show that is targeted for an audience that likes action, scary beasts and edge-of-the-seat thrills; the females are only here to provide motivation. I'm not a part of that (Action) demographic, but it seemed to me that it scored a bullseye! (The screening audience applauded.) Available for pre-order from Amazon.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I really enjoyed taking such a gorgeous journey with all its twists and turns.  I will be sad not to travel with her further.  I an going to miss not having Sookie in my life wondering what was next.  Thrilling , funny scared  very hard to put down.  All of the Skokie novels are great reads
B0000AK7AA|5.0|This is a movie that all the family can watch. This is a movie mot just for kids but adults and enjoy it too.I love the widescreen edition is awsome.  I recommend it to everyone.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Great Bond movie, Daniel Craig is a terrific Bond. All the action you ever want.<br />Will watch this one over and over.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|This movie is great.  Kids should see it so that they can tell the difference between violence and self defense, between ego and self respect.  I enjoy it and recommend it
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Loved, loved, loved it!! From the very beginning it pulled you in and it never slowed down.  Amazing entertainment! Thanks Jamie for a great book
B007SPPANM|5.0|I remember watching the original movie years ago and still it touches my heart when I watch it now.  I love what they did to the story, it is different.  The actors were great. A story of history that should not be forgotten and in this film they have done a great job, good enough that it will be remembered
0316227706|5.0|I just have to look at the cover to cheer up. It is so uplifting to scroll through the images. And inspiring photography. When ever I'm feeling a  little bit low I grab this book and can't help laughing. I love this book and have begun purchasing it for everyone I know.
B000065V42|4.0|Good family movie, and the price is just right. My kids loved it, and I enjoyed the trip down memory lane.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|I had an unexpected hospital stay, but fortunately had the presence of mind to bring my Kindle Fire.  I've always loved Firefly and Serenity, but never saw the full season!  It was a real joy watching the episodes back to back.  I love the writing in this series!  Lots of subtle humor.  The characters are the best.  Backed the series up with watching Serenity.  Best hospital stay ever!  Only bad thing is that there is only season one and Serenity.  I want more!
B00BCOQSSQ|4.0|The book is fairly good and I liked the characters. I would read other books by this author and other storylines.  I would like to see how this series ends.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|this at first seems to be a fairly simple, even brainless game. But it quickly becomes challenging, especially to get all the stars. Will keepyou entertained for hours!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|A wonderful CD ! Every track is brilliant. Can't wait to see the show now. I highly recommend this soundtrack to all!
B00C5GZKVQ|5.0|This game has improved on the first Helidroid, still similar, graphics are very nice, sounds are great too. Controls take some getting used too, and once you do, they are great too, especially when you consider that controlling a helicopter is not an easy task on any game,the controls on Helidroid 2 really do a great job. The game runs fantastically well on my Galaxy S4.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|After waiting months and months for Entwined With You to come out, especially with the release date being pushed back, I was very worried that it wasn't going to live up to my expectations of what I remembered of Gideon and Eva. I was wrong. I was not disappointed. The passion and chemistry between them was just as intense if not more!<br /><br />I felt like I got to know Gideon a whole lot more in this book than I did in the previous two in the series. Gideon's fears and vulnerability were more prevalent. He was still the all-consuming alpha male that I adore, but I loved being able to see his tenderhearted part a little more.<br /><br />Eva and Cary's relationship took a little more of an interesting edge to it as Eva had to keep secrets from her best friend, whom she used to tell every aspect of her life to. Also, having Eva's father, Victor make another appearance, added a little more drama and background into Eva's life.<br /><br />I didn't like Corrine from the beginning in the first book, and I disliked her even more with her involvement in this one. I actually liked having Brett around again. I think he adds a certain flair for drama and angst that makes it a little more interesting.<br /><br />As always, the sex in the Crossfire books was amazing! The steaminess and intimacy factors were a lot more intense. The connection between Gideon and Eva seemed to have risen to an entirely different level than that of Bared to You and Reflected In You. Some scenes in particular were just mind-blowing and scorching!<br /><br />I am very happy that Entwined With You isn't the end of the road for Gideon and Eva, I think that their story definitely has some more obstacles and twists that can make for very interesting follow ups. I just hope that we don't have to wait quite as long for the next one as we did between Reflected and Entwined.
B00BMR5HOO|2.0|I tried it for 10min then uninstalled it. Very limited if you don't live in USA. Most of the nice features are only available in the PAID version, there are much much better free weather apps & widgets for android... Looks pretty though.
B009NY43NY|1.0|This final installment was incredibly upsetting! The characters don't feel like themselves, the plot is weak and it doesn't make sense! So sad this was how it ends! Just awful! :(
B008XG1X18|5.0|I can lose and find myself with Pinterest both at the same time! I have a whole new appreciation of DIY, inspirational uplifts, new foods and recipes to try and everyday ordinary things.  Love it. Love it. Love. It!
B005PK57NU|4.0|The Good Wife is a high-quality, well-written show. The characters are interesting. For a drama, the show can be quite funny at times. I enjoy it, but I don't always catch it on network tv. It's great to find the episodes I've missed.
B0015AARJI|1.0|The controller analog sticks were very stiff when it arrived I thought nothing of it since it was brand new. A month goes by and its still stiff. One day I was watching my nephews and one broke it I looked on youtube and was seeing how to fix it and found out it was a fake and I was sure it was a fake because I opened up my first controller and the inside was way different.
B005MLOOJA|4.0|I enjoy this show a lot, but I've only caught it sporadically on network TV. It was a real joy to be able to catch every episode, and in order. The characters are fun to follow. Even though it can sometimes seem like a prime-time soap opera, it works on a much deeper level.
B0000AUHQT|5.0|By Far,  the  Best  of  film  version  of  the Great  Gatsby  made.<br /><br /> Great  Acting, Great Actors,  Great Story.  a  Film  That  Can&#34;t  Be  Missed,<br /><br />  Ray
B009NY43NY|5.0|I've heard that  they are not going to continue this series. I'll miss the antics of vamps and were's alike. This book had some twists and turns I didn't  expect.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Did not start watching it until I saw it on Amazon.  Really enjoy the cases and main story line.  Good Drama.
B001B1UO6W|5.0|This is a criminal that practice VooDoo and learn to switch places with any object or persons body. In this case his soul is in  boy doll called &#34;Good Guy&#34;...very ironic uh? Now he wants to switch back in human form and is after a litle boy.<br /><br />Better color, sound Fx, Special features, behind scenes, still gallery, etc.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I've always loved the supernatural sequel, now I have to wait for the ninth season to begin, kinda bums me out
0425263924|3.0|I was very daissapointed with this book all it was was sex and not much storyline and there was no need for the C word to be used so much made Eva a nimpho a long wait and after reafing many other enjoyable books while I waited and it ended very abruptly will I read the next one probably not
B008VBYN80|4.0|Overall I am enjoying the game there are some issues with staying connected and also the Guild function does not work well.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|Always like post apocalyptic show where a group has to come together and overcome impossible odds. This shows got all the elements.
B007TNS6JI|2.0|Don't like the controls. Not the type of game that I enjoy. Wish it was more of a strategic game.
B007WEQ3K8|5.0|I tried the free edition first and played it for 3 hours straight. So decided to get the pro edition one and love it. Thanks for the great brain and mind workout.
B0026Q8EWW|5.0|Great film, kept my family very interested. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys John Grisham type stories. Matt Damon rocks.
B00000IQV6|5.0|This movie is super funny and brings other issues like grief, love, compassion, determination and success. I have seen it before but I had to have it.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|wow this book grabs you by the hart. I was about go give up with what seemed like every one dieing, and it leveled off and kept me on the hook. love the message that people should be good to each other. This author is very good at what he does.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Love this game! This game is fun and challenging! I tell all my friends about it! I play for hours and my kid loves it too!
B006GECE9Y|4.0|I just started using this browser on my KF HD 8.9 inch.  It seems a lot faster than the stock Silk browser.  With Silk, I was noticing temporary blurred text when I would scroll up or down on a web page.  I haven't seen this with Dolphin.  I also like the interface better, especially how it arranges bookmarked pages.<br /><br />All in all, a pretty good browser for the KF HD.
B00992CF6W|5.0|In the next update there will be buckets of lava and water and it is totally going to be awesome
B008KP6ENE|5.0|I really enjoy this game. Love the graphics.  It's reminiscent of LITTLE BIG PLANET and SUPER MARIO BROTHERS!  Makes me want to get a bigger Android device!! :D
B000JMKQX0|5.0|More than one example of human reaction to a crisis.this made It very interesting and informative. The only book that put the human factor in it's story telling
B000009HF2|5.0|I was so surprised that I could find this old tape. Lots of the old songs are hard to find. I love having a place to find everything.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Short, easy to do and overall effective. I'm still on Workout 1 and I only do it 3 times a week, but I see a difference in muscle tone in my arms, legs, back and shoulders. 20 minutes? Yeah, even I can do that!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|A good challenge and great graphics.  Would definitely recommend this to anyone with a little time on their hands.  Can't wait for the next Room to come out.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a fun game on either the iphone or kindle, and the picture looks great! Try not to get addicted!
B00APUTEBG|2.0|This movie was pretty lame. Willis is shot and killed near the beginning. Giving it about 2 stars.  So, if you have absolutely nothing else to watch.....
B008EKOIN8|5.0|I love all his books and this one did not disappoint. I now have the urge to go bake some bread. I think I'll go do that.
B005PK57IK|5.0|This show has mystery, sexy actors, and suspense.  You want to watch the next episode to keep up with each character's evolution.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Purchased this for my Kindle and it was well worth it!  Fantastic story.  Can't wait for season 3 to start.
B004WR125O|5.0|The receiver works great with it, I get all the internet radio I can stand to listen to. All the free ones and the pay ones
B00992CF6W|5.0|Johan Bernhardsson (Minecraft PE Creator) said its summited so it would take like 1 or 2 days.So let's be patient from now  &lt;3
B004SKJTY6|4.0|Exemplary film of one of the great associations between a therapist and a modern king of England with a speech problem
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Loved it on my PC, my iPod Touch, and now my Galaxy S2 and my Android tab. This game has a great art style, requires thought and strategy (especially if you want to use as few goo-balls as possible for the OCD achievement). It's kind of a bridge building game, except no truck has to drive on it. The only real load bearing you have to worry about is of the structure itself. Its more about getting the structure high enough and around obstacles, and doing it using as few goo balls as possible. It is a great game and I heartily recommend it.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|My niece suggested I watch this series and after watching . Season 1-3 for free I could not wait to see what happened next.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|So pretty much you can't go wrong there. You like CtR? You'll like this. It has a few new twists outlined in its description, but really...you already bought this game so my review is kind of superfluous. If you haven't, get on Google Play, get the free ad supported version of any of the CtR games and give them a go. You'll know within a few levels if this physics puzzler is for you. I give it a hearty thumbs up. I'm a &#34;hardcore&#34; gamer for what it's worth, and my sister loves it and all she plays are casual games. So it definitely has wide appeal.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|My kind off show... love everything and anything broadway...love the music and Very proud to see how well K McPherson is doing.
B00942X8PY|4.0|Simple to understand, starts you off slow and then gets more challenging at a fair clip (some games take too long to ramp up, this one does it well). The game is kind of mindless while still requiring some strategy as they throw more kinks into the puzzle mechanics. It's zen-like for quite a while, and ends up a little mix of pre-stage strategy and trial and error. It's a good game that I played for a while, but never felt the need to finish. I definitely got my fun out of it, so I have no trouble recommending it.
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|There was really no story, just a lot of crashes and some explosions. Huge let down from the fantastic previous movie. Seemed like they wrote this in an hour and assumed we're dumb enough to all buy in because \\"die hard\\" is in the title. I'm insulted
B00846WWVM|3.0|It's an OK game, but wasn't one I could ever get invested in. The puzzle element wasn't as strong to me as the luck element. Being physics based, it was more heavily leaned towards sporadicness in the way water was handled than with any kind of reliability. Which is fine, except that means that there weren't really repeatable answers, and more to the point, relied a lot more heavily on luck than ability. I had to play the same levels severals times while knowing what to do, waiting for the water to behave and put the fire out of its own accord. And as the fire spreads, the worse it gets. So if it doesn't behave correctly at the start, good luck not mashing the restart button. Just wasn't a game for me, but it did have good production values.
B005VT42BS|5.0|I connected to multiple networks using several different encryption protocols. Good for determining 'guest' access, confirming mac spoofing and machine names.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|It's certainly fun, though it is no Cut the Rope. You'll slide your little goo-guys around until they solidify, stopping them against the environment or each other - otherwise they fly off the map and the game restarts. The challenge of getting them together is pretty low, but the challenge of getting all 3 stars (by overlapping the goo-gents on to the star tiles) is far more challenging. If you just go to clear the levels, don't expect to get much brain teasing or fun out of it. If you go for the stars, it's definitely a solid game. I would recommend giving it a go if you are a fan of puzzle games.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have had a lot of BORING games pass by. Now this game is AWESOME, I have never had such a great game like this. I prefer you get it!:)
B006O3MU96|2.0|I never understood the grand enjoyment most get out of this game. It's fun for about 2 minutes and then you've basically done all you can do. If you really like the sit down and play it once or twice in the span of a few minutes in attempts to best previous records, I suppose this might be for you. There are plenty of casual typed games I enjoy. This isn't one of them. Never like it on my iPod Touch, still don't care for it on my Galaxy S2 or Android tab. Just never can keep my attention. So from that stand point, I can't personally recommend it.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Just finished reading and couldn't put it down.  I'm almost afraid to see the movie since I'm usually disappointed in movie versions.  Suspense and romance...didn't expect the twist at the end but what a great twist!  I was on the edge of my seat at the end.  Wanted it to keep going.  Loved the characters and the story.
B00992CF6W|5.0|When is the new update coming in to action it creates buckets and has a new title screen. there might be other stuff to.
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|Good Movie. Glad I watched this. Good actors and story line. I think they should make a TV series out of this movie.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|So sad the trilogy is complete, over. A very real ending. Left teary.  I await the movies hopeful for a true rendition of the books.
B000TCEU4Q|5.0|I bought this to go with the Saitek Yoke and Pedels to give me extra controls for my FSX experience and it works just fine.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|It's bad enough it took months(!) to get this book, only to find there was barely a storyline. It was nice to see the end of Nathan in the last book, but now it't clear there's something more. Ms. Day is dragging out the story and I'm not sure why. The relationship between Gideon and Eva is stronger but you just know that the mystery man in Megumi's life will be bad news in the next book (he's most likely going to turn our to be Christopher, Gideon's half bro.). And of course Anne Lucas finally shows up, again you just know she's trouble waiting to happen. And what's with the twist in Nathan's tale. Who's the godfather? Stanton? Or someone Gideon's Dad scammed, just waiting for revenge? I wish Ms. Day had wrapped this up. A trilogy means three for a reason. What a let-down for $10. I think I'll wait for the release of the next 2 books and read their reviews before buying any more of this series.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|My grandson read it for school and suggested that I read it and I read all the books and loved the movie
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its very addicting to play! love it, Nothing wrong with the game but, be careful how you slide your thumb or you will get run over.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Who would have guessed that Kaleb could be so EMOTIONAL?  In Heart of Obsidian, Nalini is masterful in redefining a cold unfeeling non redeemable individual into a warm captivating hero.  The love story between Kaleb and Sahara was emotional, believable and BEAUTIFUL.  More importantly, their story move the Psy/Changeling/ Human Civil War plot along to an acceptable conflict.<br /><br />Most times, an author has difficulty in keeping the story fresh after so many books in the series and after the previous book (Tangle of Need), I was quite concerned with its continual success.  Nalini has proven my doubts wrong and has cemented herself into a class ALL by herself.
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|For those of you born later than 1975, this movie may seem original, dark and moody, but to me it, it was just a blend of &#34;1984&#34; (oppressive government crushes the individual spirit), &#34;Rollerball&#34; (corporate world where only blood sports will keep society from rebellion), &#34;Logan's Run&#34; (youth culture is worshipped, but there's a terrible price to pay) and &#34;Soylent Green&#34; (world out of resources resorts to desperate measures). Not a single original thought in the whole movie. Throw in the virtual reality elements of the &#34;Matrix&#34; trilogy and some comic bits straight from &#34;The Fifth Element&#34; and you've got &#34;The Hunger Games.&#34; I found it dull. Jennifer Lawrence is pretty, but that doesn't make the movie worth watching. I'm glad I didn't pay money to see this tired bag of science fiction cliches!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I have to agree with the comments from the other readers about being disappointed with this book. Let me just preface my remarks with: I actually like Eva(a surprise with the kind of female characters available in this genre). She is a great heroine. Gideon is my *favorite* book boyfriend; he really is, but I can't help but think the reason there is a continuation is simply because of $$$. Do I like the idea of reading more of their story? Yes, absolutely. However, we could have learned about this before this book was released. We have waited and waited for the third installment, even through an extremely disappointing delay. These may be the realities of the publishing world but that does not mean that I, as a consumer, have to agree with or like the decisions. After the anticipation of this book, I just can't help but feel let down. There was some character development but there really wasn't any story progression. It was all 'filler', IMO.  I suppose we know now why there was a delay and why this story is like it is.  All in all, it was kind of boring.  I expected to read it in one night (like I did the other two) but it took me four days because it just wasn't that interesting.  Maybe I was expecting too much but I hope Sylvia Day and/or Berkley realize they have done more harm than good to this series by doing things the way they have.
B007UXT6T6|5.0|This movie had all the thrills, suspense and nail-biting action of the best of the original series. Tense, strange and filled with more plot twists than a French cruller, I highly recommend this movie to any fan of suspense and spy thrillers. I could not see the end coming in a million years!
B008YKGQR4|5.0|This is much easier to navigate than the smaller version.  It has the same features that I am use to.
B00B7Y3DCA|5.0|The King in Yellow (the collection) has been a favorite of mine since childhood. A classic and a must-read for anyone who enjoys classic literature and/or horror fiction.<br /><br />Chambers's style transcends generations, making the prose feel fresh and the story engrossing even 118 years after its initial publishing.<br /><br />A beautifully done classic from a master of the genre.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Very easy to use.  More accurate than the others.  This is easy to read with great graphs. I like that I can add other locations very easily.
B002361MLA|5.0|We need more souls like Eckhart Tolle on this planet!<br />He explains things in a clear, non-ego driven manner. The audio version is great, and it is Eckhart reading it.<br />Must have book for spiritual seekers.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|Should have called this volume: The Book of Battles. I loved that plenty of characters die, yet the end was very Disney-ish. That is the only reason I gave it for stars, for I wanted it to be a little darker when it all ended.
B008SOS63S|5.0|This is an awesome set of cd's! Bonamassa at his finest!!! Great to hear him with Beth Hart & John Hiatt too! Only thing better is if I could have been there.  T.Lee
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|this is perfect for my bluetooth to protect it in my purse , it was a very good price , i love it
B007R3AZNK|5.0|Bonamassa firing on all cylinders, that's for sure. He keeps proving that he's a legend, as he puts out the quality material he does.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|Worth the money and it definitely pulls you in! Square enix is really a master of the rpg. Get it!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is an excellent story, fiction appearing to be very factual.  Main character is well portrayed.  It is not a comedy by any stretch, but a well written story of our history during Hitler's time.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Couldn't wait to read this after reading the first two. Did not disappoint. Again a book for all ages. Great writer.
0345529057|5.0|Excellent summer (or winter) reading.  Have lots of time available and I recommend you see the movie first, before you read the books.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wonderful read for people of all ages. Well written and really kept my interest. We read the book out loud to each other.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I read the book b4 seeing the movie.  I would recommend doing that.  Jennifer Lawrence did a great job.  As did all the actors involved.  I look forward to the next movie in this series and hope the cast stays together for all sequels.
B00BKRON5K|3.0|Interesting approach with a lot of great info on health, general wellness and the dangers of processed food.  Some bits are on the extreme, faddish side though.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|This is a good movie to watch without kids. It has distilled some excellent observations about modern middle age generation.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game, the graphics are great, the mini games are so cute, and I love horses! I recommend this app for any horse lover!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Fun game :) would recommend to friends who enjoy hidden object and mystery games.  Storyline was good and mini games were fun too ... mini games could have been a link more challenging but overall a really great game
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|the full novel for $4.00, what's not to like? wasn't sure this worked for the ipad but then I got the kindle app and I was good to go.
B004Z4LZ7E|1.0|i like the book but it has two pages that are off the book, and honestly i dont like it
B008YU0AOE|5.0|Calculator comes in handy. My boys use it for school work. My husband uses it for his business. My son advised me to get this. Glad I did.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I loved everything about this book except that it was the last one of this series .. I really hope she writes more for us Sookie was such a great character and her world was fascinating.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|My son added this app for me. I haven't used it yet. So I don't know how to rate it yet.
0805092447|5.0|This was one of my kids favorite books.  (we went through 2 copies when they were little.) Now I like to give it as a gift to anyone I know that's having a baby.  In hind sight I probably should have bought the cardboard version.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I am glad I have this app on my Android. I refer to it quite  often.  Would like to be able to see a map of the whole country and what the weather looks like across it.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This is not the genre I usually go for; I have to stop writing this review so I can start reading the next book!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This is so nice to have on my Android. I like to be able to have access to my friends no matter where I may be.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I use this game to practise my mind. It is very nice to see a non violent, relaxing, and high quality game for Android.
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|My son added this for me. I have no idea how to play it yet. My son enjoys it I guess.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|This is such a fun game. So addicting. Reminds me of the game LBP on my PS3. last 3 words
B00CATSONE|2.0|I looked forward to reading about Nikola Tesla. This is not the book for that. Its about other geniuses, inventors, etc.
B001FSDOZO|5.0|I love love love love nickelback and this cd is the best yet.  I can work all day listening to this over and over again.
B00992CF6W|5.0|AWESOME great for kids you can design anything you want to.<br /><br />KIDS will not stop all my friends play minecraft
0061743526|5.0|This is my all time favorite book.  I first read it as a high school student when it was newly published, and I have reread it several times since.  This is a book that no one should miss.
B00AEBB8BK|4.0|It is funny how so many things that most people have have been unaware of in advertising have been happening for a very long time. Commercials, products in  movies, or tv shows, and more. They are all there. Watch it and keep it.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I really enjoy this game.  The artwork and character of Om nom makes me smile.  And I love the fact that it is built around problem solving.
B00BN3EE1O|2.0|A waste of time and money.  Julianne Hough is a much better dancer than actress. I did not like it at all.
1432794426|5.0|After reading \\"Defending A King- His Life & His Legacy by Dr. Karen Moriarty, I was very touched by the way Karen put her whole heart and soul into researching every little detail about Michael. This book has proved once and for all and of course what I knew all along, that Michael was a beautiful, caring, giving and humble soul, who thought more about others than he did himself. Which is why all of his fans (especially me) love him for. I only wish that I had've had the opportunity to meet him in person, to sit down with him and talk about anything and everything, as a normal everyday person, which is what he was. All Michael ever wanted in his life, was to love and be loved for who he is and not for what he could do. I just wish all the MJ haters out there would take the time to read this book, to see Michael for who he was as a person and not for what the trashy tabloids and media made him out to be. Thank you so much Karen, from the bottom of my heart for the time you took to perfect this beautiful book. Michael will never be forgotten and will always live on in our hearts. I look forward to reading any more books that you may write about Michael. God Bless, all my L.O.V.E. Kerri ¢¾
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I think the writers have created a great drama.  I especially like the legal battle that reaches a conclusion in each episode.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Felt like the author was tired of the series and just wanted to get it over with. It was ok but could have had a better series resolution.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I was looking forward to reading Gideon's story, that is what EWY  was supposed to be about.  Instead it is now book 3 of five.... so not much happens to advance the story, Gideon's story, which we were told this book would be about.... more questions than answers.  If I had only paid $5 or less for this book it would have been a nonissue.... at $10 it is a BIG issue. No harm done, Amazon refunded my $!!! Amazon gets 5 stars!!!!!!
B008602KQI|4.0|Ever wonder what would happen when the elite control everything? Where human beings become their toys and playthings. The Hunger Games clearly depicts humanity as expendable and servants of the elite. There is a glimmer of hope in this movie, but it is only an attempt to placate the masses, pacifying the the hungry with minimal rewards. Let's hope this a science fiction movie and not a projection of our future!
0307956350|3.0|Did I read The Expats or didn't I? Was Kate in Paris or Amsterdam or Luxembourg or Washington DC or South America. Was she or was she not with the CIA? Secrets. Did she kill people? Did she make friends? Was she married with children? I don't know. Was Julia her friend? From across the street the MacLeane's yes focused on Kate that she felt but couldn't see. Puzzling. Were her new friends wife and husband or were they FBI agents on loan. How many toes did each of them have? Did they even have feet. Where are the children, in bed, at school, interviewing for a new school? Was Dexter her husband, the man who fathered her two children. Is the coffee cold? Who ground the coffee beans into fifty million Euros? Was that Dexter? Is he a thief, an insecure man, a liar, a good father? What was Dexter's job? Killing money? Was his brother really killed? Is there even a Croatian contact? Where did I put my socks, in the refrigerator? Did she stab herself in the back and make it look like Julia did it? Where are human ethics, cultural morals, literary hygiene?<br /><br />Pavone's unusual writing and format styles takes time to digest. I gave this 3 stars for its diverse plotting strategy, which saved many twists and emotional angles until the end. Nonetheless for me, there were too many convoluted twists and psychotherapeutic angles that keeps this story unbelievable, but it is fiction and fiction can go anywhere the writer needs to go.<br /><br />Is The Expats worthy of a Pulitzer Prize?<br />Hmmmmm?
B007N8RULO|4.0|I am fan of any solitaire and really like the layout of this one.<br />very easy to navigate playing board.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Careful, this is addictive and with three game modes your Saturday night will disappear in a jiffy. Fun! Hypnotic!<br />Family friendly
B0063M22QO|3.0|is okay for a quick game, but does not require much concentration and thought.<br />would enjoy more if a bit more difficult.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|Fun game, but I was disappointed with the abrupt ending. It seemed like the story just ran out. I was looking forward to more challenges...
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I was so afraid when this book went live on June 4th and bad reviews started pouring in!<br />I loved EWY! I don't know why people are so up in arms about it not ending in this third book and there being five in the series. When I first purchased Reflected in you yes, the third one was supposed to be the last one, but that was the only time I read about EWY being the last; and a couple of weeks ago it was everywhere, on Twitter, Facebook and Sylvia's page that she had decided to write a quintet...I was thrilled! Those of us who adore Gideon and Eva don't want to see it end, and like many other reviewers have stated, ending it with EWY would have felt rushed, there's so much more to tell and so much more to resolve, it wouldn't have been fair to these two amazingly written characters! Something else I want to point out: despite the fact that The Crossfire Series is on a league of its own when it comes to contemporary romance novels/erotica, people still compare it to Fifty Shades of Grey and that's not fair! First of all, FSOG is lame, so lame, a Twilight fanfiction turned into an erotic book? Come on! From excerpts I've read online it is BAD! Secondly, people always say Sylvia Day copied EL James' story and how can that be when they both published their books on the same DAY? And clearly Sylvia is a talented writer who's been publishing books for a looong time!<br />Anyway, on to the story! xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx SPOILERS xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<br />I loved Entwined with You, loved, loved, loved, loved! Yes, there isn't as much going on as in the other books, but I still loved it....one thing, in the beginning the characters didn't feel like themselves to me, I felt something was off, but I don't know whether it was me or if that was done intentionally by the author after all that happened. Maybe it was done on purpose, after Eva finding out about Gideon killing Nathan...I'm sure that even though Eva adores him she must have felt something, not fear, but trepidation...and Gideon must have felt pretty anxious after that too, not knowing how she would react. So my guess is that the author made it that way.....but after the super hot nightclub scene I felt things went back to normal between them(well, as normal as things can get between them! lol)<br />I also loved that they got married just the two of them on that island! It's exactly what I wanted for them, to have that intimacy and privacy, no pressure from their families and Gideon's status, we can have the big wedding later, but for now it's just the two of them knowing that they're Mr & Mrs Cross!<br />I can't wait for the next two books, I feel like Sylvia is honoring her readers and her characters by having two more books. Gideon still has to work through some stuff, his nightmares, his relationship with his family....we still need to know about the mob guy and what happened there, and to be certain that no one knows anything about what Gideon did, Deanna needs to get a grip, lol, and so much more!<br />Bravo, Mrs Day,Bravo!!!
B000GPIPVU|5.0|I found Ray LaMontagne while listening to a Mumford & Sons channel on Pandora and quickly converted immediately creating a channel for the song Empty.  I'm addicted.  All his albums are fantastic and I can't figure out which one I like more.  Be Here Now and Gone Away from Me I rate slightly higher than Empty and Lesson Learned is on equal footing.  So many of his songs top my playlist it is truly amazing- I honestly usually don't pick up new artists this fast.<br /><br />I've always like songs with passion and power.  In my youth I tended toward the power in hard rock (which I still like) but I guess with age I prefer passion in the way of soulful songs that tell a story, something with passion.  Another thing I like are songs that build.  That is LaMontagne in a nutshell.<br /><br />While I often listen to my \\"Far From Empty\\" Pandora channel in the background I often find myself stopping when a  LaMontagne song comes on.  Unlike a lot of the other songs that come on from Mumford, Monsters and Men, Amos Lee, Band Of Horses, and Dave Mathews, Ray's song often capture my attention and demand to be listened to.  Many of Ray's songs just wouldn't show up in rotation which led me to get his albums.  I'm usually disappointed with 1/2 of the songs any any artists albums, sometimes only liking a single song, but 80-90% of Ray's songs score well above average in my rather large collection.
B000FC146C|5.0|I have read The Thornbirds twice and will probably read it again in a few years.  I think it's one of the best epic novels ever written.  The characters are so well defined, the scenery is the same and the story is wonderful. It has a bit of everything one would want in a generational story, which I always have loved, but this is the best one I've read.  It's a real page turner and even though it's very long, I read it in about three days the first time.  I didn't want to put it down!  Definitely one of my all time favorite books.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|the game is just so awesome and so much better than the original! All I can say is its AWESOME!!!
B004EPYZV2|4.0|Cruise is quietly a pretty good action movie star. His Ethan character is smart and he carries his weight. Good movie overall.
1844488748|5.0|This is a great book, well writtena dn easy to undestand, the pictures are excellent!  Very inspriring looking forward to completing the sampler. Thanks for writting such a good book
B00AEBB8FQ|4.0|I love when Hollywood makes fun of itself since they are so ridiculous.  I found myself thinking \\"okay, he's imitating that famous actor, and the other guy is.....\\".  Plus the fact that Hollywood is always making a trillion sequels, all the little nuances they throw in makes you laugh.
B00CHILW64|5.0|Great movie, perfectly portraying the true story about the real family and a tear jerker. If you are human, you will cry.
1590171993|2.0|The reverence this novel is held in really baffles and saddens me. I began it with considerable curiosity and fairly high expectations, since the book was lent me by a well-read, well-meaning friend who greatly admires it -- and also since I had just read a paean to it on a very stimulating blog called Literary Commentary, run by a writer and academic named D. G. Myers, who has apparently battled cancer and who proclaimed \\"Stoner\\" a great source of strength to him.  [Update:  Myers got into a dispute and was forced out of that blog and back to his own, A Commonplace Blog, where his latest posting -- June 7, 2013 -- contains even more praise for the book and reports that it's \\"been getting a lot of buzz lately.\\"]<br /><br /> Well, whatever; I'm glad it's helped sustain Myers in his illness. But as a sometime academic myself  (like the novel's hero and like Myers, I've spent years teaching English at the college level), I found barely any truth in this earnest, humorless book and a lot that made me drum my fingers with impatience.<br /><br /> What surprised me most was how clumsily manipulative each scene turns out to be, with a maddeningly predictable plot and stereotypical characters without a breath of life in them. There's Prof. Stoner himself, an improbably virtuous, high-minded, naïve protagonist that comes off more as a specimen, an extreme \\"type,\\" than as a real person --half Sad Sack, half pious Christian martyr. Then there are his parents, a sober, taciturn farm couple right out of American Gothic; various slightly cartoonish villains (a mendacious student, a malevolent department head, Stoner's frigid hysteric of a wife) who give themselves away with every veiled, malicious glance, every sneer, every arrogant remark; and a love interest who, from the moment she enters the hero's classroom, practically wears a sign saying \\"This Is the Woman the Hero's Going to Have a Doomed Affair With\\" (which is exactly what happens a few chapters later).<br /><br /> Several thoughts kept occurring to me as I dutifully made my way through the book (trying all the while to find nice things to say to the friend who'd loaned it to me). One was something the film critic Pauline Kael once said about a very stark, solemn, wordless black-and-white Japanese film called \\"The Island\\": She speculated that critics had hailed the film as a masterpiece because (I paraphrase from memory) \\"it MUST be art, because it sure ain't entertainment.\\"<br /><br /> Another recurring thought was how much the novel reminded me of Sinclair Lewis's work -- I'm thinking primarily of \\"Main Street\\" and \\"Babbitt\\" -- in that it stands back and scrutinizes crabbed Midwestern types from a certain dispassionate, almost sociological distance. But Lewis's novels are richer and, again, for all the bleakness of their vision, they're at times quite funny, whereas this book -- except for a few unconvincing passages meant to celebrate the hero's lofty love of literature -- is thoroughly (and, I suspect, deliberately) joyless.<br /><br /> Throughout, in fact, the narrative remains dead and distant, often reading like a dry summary of events rather than a living work of fiction; indeed, at times the book reads like the Cliff's Notes précis of a novel.<br /><br /> Which brings up a further problem: We're told over and over about how dedicated the hero is to teaching and how absorbed he is in his literary subject matter, but it's all described so abstractly that it never seems real; we're simply to accept that he's Found His Calling. Stoner's interactions with his students and his fellow professors ring false; I gather that the author, John Williams, was himself an academic, but you'd swear he never entered a classroom.<br /><br />  Still another thought: This has got to be one of the most Gentile novels I've ever read -- and not in a good way! Everyone we encounter seems to inhabit an irony-free zone.<br /><br />  I suppose one reason so many people regard this book as well written may be its unfashionably stodgy, old-fashioned, formal, measured, colorless prose; it's lifeless, yes, but always tasteful, and perhaps that's what has impressed some readers -- like audiences that cheer certain movies for being free of sex, violence, and dirty words.<br /><br /> The best thing about the edition I read -- the New York Review of Books paperback -- is the cover illustration, Thomas Eakins's The Thinker. It's a terrifically apt image and wonderfully well chosen. (The only cover image that compares, I think -- i.e., that's equally evocative and appropriate -- is an old Penguin cover for George Gissing's \\"New Grub Street\\": a detail from Whistler's very atmospheric \\"Nocturne in Grey and Gold: Chelsea Snow.\\")<br /><br /> Needless to say, I've set down all the above (in some haste, obviously) for readers who, as I was, were bored and disappointed by the book and are afraid their opinions mark them as insensitive philistines who surely must be Missing Something. Let me reassure you: You got it right.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|timely - considering the advances in biological science - something like this could happen, Tatiana Maslany is excellent. Totally enjoyable. Looking forward to the next season.

B003WUYRGI|4.0|I liked that this book had a very wide selection of words and definitions. I would have liked to see more pronunciation words in it. Overall I believe this was a good dictionary.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|I saw this concert on DVD which I borrowed from my brother a while ago. I love most of the songs that they performed on this concert. The picture quality and audio(DTS format) were excellent so when I saw this thing advertised on Amazon in Blu-ray format I placed my order thinking this must be way better than the DVD format and boy I was right. It's worth the money. Highly recommended!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app should be on everybody's kindle fires and other devices because it is just the best app ever made. I talked the second best step to pc edition and it's almost just the same. THIS APP IS A MUST GET AND IF U DON'T U HAVE PROBLEMS.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|a great game to pass the time away.  the levels get harder to higher you go but that is what makes it more appealing and challenging!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I am simply a mom,who reads to getaway and go to sleep. It's me time. I gave this 5 stars because I finished this in two nights, two weeks ago. I still keep thinking about it. It was twisted, and I closed the book thinking how messed up it was...in the page turner kind of way. Thanks to the author for a good read that was different from the norm !
B006OCM0G0|5.0|fun and addicting game!  I already play Bakery Story so this was guaranteed to be a good game. goals are fun and easy to accomplish.
B00632HWOG|4.0|If you have more than one email account it says they are all online but you still have to select them separately to check them. don't like that, infact I missed a ton of important emails cuz I didn't realize it :( so I figured I'd warn others!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was great followed great to the last sequel.  Suspense was good and kept me wanting more. Ending could have been better.
B0036T31YY|4.0|I had not heard of this movie at all, and took a chance.  Glad I did.  A well written story, and the lead actress was perfect.  It was thoughtful and suspenseful and scary and moved at a good pace.  I'd watch it again.<br /><br />I did watch the trailer first and it gave away some of what would have been great plot twists watching the movie the first time.  Read the reviews and decide.  I say, watch this movie.
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|This is the best movie of all times. I have watched it about 15 times and I could watch it 15 more it is one of my very favorites a great movie,
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Works great. I especially love the way it handles my searches where it remembers what I have previously viewed on each search list.
B00BEXB18M|5.0|i am giving this album a five star rating! First i must say this is NOT \\"risk\\" part two. I know that we are all entitled to our own opinion and everyone has different takes on this genre...but for a band that withstands the test of time for over thirty years and still maintains some of their intregity of roots from what they originated from is impressive. Dave mustaine an intelligent musician as well as businessman has been able to change the sound of megadeth but have that familiar feel according to the changing times while losing some fanbase but gaining new ones. All the great bands have done the same such as van halen, aerosmith, metallica, and even mastodon to name a few. This album has something for everyone and is very enjoyable to listen to.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This is a great app that simply keeps tract of the percent of battery left and also the remaining hours left.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Enjoy, relaxing, like the music. Makes you think but not in a rushed stressful way. I am enjoying the challenge as it gets more difficult as you go forward.
B006LSZECO|2.0|A friend of mine got this book to read in her book club and I was looking for something new to read so she suggested it and wanted me to let her know what I thought when I was done.  I read some of the reviews here before I bought it also.  I will say that generally bad reviews saying they didn't like something in particular don't usually sway me because each person is different but I took what negatives and positives were said and I purchased it.  The one that got me the most excited to read it was from Caley Anderson who said \\"the ending doesn't just come - it punches you in the gut.\\"  I now honestly think she was referring to another book and not this one.<br /><br />The plot was great so that is the only thing that saved this from me giving it one star.  I soon found myself predicting every \\"bombshell\\" that the story was leading up to.  I found myself hoping I was going to be wrong and that the author had something sneaky up her sleeve but it never came.  I kept reading because based on many positive reviews I was waiting for that shoe to drop and when I found myself on the last page I was checking to make sure I was really at the end.  Every review about the bad ending was right.  I found myself just staring at my Kindle saying \\"Really?  That's it?\\"  It wasn't even an ending that is left up to the reader's imagination on how it ends.  There is no closure, no justice and just a lazy, lazy, lazy ending.  That is the only way to describe the huge hole left in the story.  There is no \\"punch in the gut ending\\" as described in one review.  I'm a huge fan of the thriller/suspense genre and the write ups and reviews made it sound like this book would put the rest all to shame.  Not. Even. Close.<br /><br />The end of the second part is where this story takes a huge leap into lazy writing and I was bored the rest of the way!  I kept reading because I wanted to know what this huge \\"bombshell\\" was but alas, it never came.  We are expected to believe that these smart, clever, witty characters who are meticulous in their planning and who never leave a stone unturned suddenly become the dumbest people on earth after one snag in their plan.  Really?  There is a such thing as a dumb criminal but come on!  The character build ups of Nick and Amy were done very well and I liked the back and forth of each perspective.  So once you get to know both characters, there is no way the ending seems plausible or believable.<br /><br />To the reviewers who say that those of us who didn't like the end must not \\"get it\\", get over yourselves.  The idea that those of us who didn't like the end are somehow intellectually inferior makes your review irrelevant.  I \\"got it\\" just fine but that doesn't equate to me having to agree with you.  ~~~~~~~~~SPOILER ALERT~~~~~~~  You also obviously know nothing about pregnancy and the process of artificial insemination and the amount of money it takes if you truly believe that part of the ending and its timeline.  All of Amy's money was stolen and she and Nick were broke so where did the thousands of dollars comes from for the procedure?  Without the mention of her using a turkey baster, this plot twist is not only impossible but improbable.  If you believe that, fine but please lose the \\"if you don't agree with me you're in idiot\\" mentality!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is a lot fun and a great way to waste time. However I don't like the fact that there isn't a journal tab to view your horses health and stuff with tips on what to do to help it.
B00BOTCKCW|5.0|I've just completed watching Parade's End for the second time and much to my surprise, it was just as enjoyable as the first time. Second time around watching usually loses something... but not in this case.<br /><br />The stoic and admirable character of Christopher Tietjens is beautifully played by Benedict Cumberbatch and without question, one of his best roles. He shows such pain in the situations faced - whether it be the result of being honorable or often being caused by his manipulative wife, Sylvia, played by the stunning Rebecca Hall. You cannot help but loathe her character due to all of the crap she pulls on everyone. But in the same breath, you also feel some pity for her - the obvious desperation to be needed and loved by the one man she cannot - maybe even shouldn't - have. Then in walks Valentine Wannop - a kindred spirit to Tietjens and against what is \\"right\\", you're rooting for them to be together.<br /><br />The characters were fantastic and the story is captivating - along with Mr. Cumberbatch's sultry baritone voice. Parade's End offered a view into a time where honor, duty, shame and freedom were completely different than that of today. And after you're done watching - there's this wistfulness of a simpler and more nobler day lingering.<br /><br />If you enjoy historical fiction (Pride & Prejudice, The Other Boleyn Girl, Persuasion, etc.) - you will most definitely enjoy Parade's End.
B009NY43NY|1.0|After investing hours of reading this series I am quite disappointed in the lack of creativity & development the ending provided.  There are many sub plots that were ignored or written so poorly I felt like I was reading nothing more than a mediocre high schoolers story.  I knew going in to this last book the ending was not going to be the HEA I'd hoped for, which I was ready to accept since these were not \\"my\\" characters or stories, but was truly disappointed in how lack luster & rushed the story read.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series had me hooked from the start. I think I watched all three seasons in less than a month!
B002LAM7PI|4.0|I watched this with my grandkids and actually enjoyed it. I have now seen the movie two times this week.
B0055PMJMW|1.0|but you only get a few chapters of each, grrrrrrrr!. I should've seen the few pages and realized that they were just teasers. Otherwise LOVE Connelly books.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|Enjoyed this so much. I would recommend it for anyone who enjoys comedy, irony and history. The unexpected adventure for this rest home escapee is amazing.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|from the same developers as cut the rope.  This is a neat little puzzle game with cute graphics.  Similar game mechanics to games like Fling but with a cool twist.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Not sure where I played this before by have a good time playing it. Do not need any WiFi to play it. Will be great for being on the plane trip coming up.
174179918X|2.0|This book was a good primer for learning about the various places to visit in Korea, but it rarely helped us on the ground. Some of the places they recommend have been closed for some time, and the prices are definitely out of date. I'd expect it to be more useful considering it just came out in February, and we visited Korea in June. The maps aren't always very helpful, and they could provide more details on how to reach the major sights. Also, I agree with a previous reviewer: the suggested itineraries are ambitious at best. You could easily spend two weeks in Seoul, let alone the rest of the country. The next edition needs to be updated throughout; it seems like this one may have just been published with a current date and a new cover image.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved the whole series. Caught my attention and didn't want to put it down. Glad I downloaded the books at the same time.
B000002HH9|4.0|A very good and underrated album by The Cure, with many good songs and lyrics. Fun, a very mood swings...Some songs ruin it, being some of the worst in the Cure catalog: the awful \\"round and round\\" and the unbearable \\"Gone\\". Why are they even there, when a song such as \\"ocean\\" has been left out? Silly. \\"Mint car\\" is a second rate friday I'm in love and I think we could live without it. But if you just cancel them, you find the real good album! That is:<br /><br />1. Want<br />2. Club America<br />3. The 13th<br />4. Strange attraction<br />5. Mint car<br />6. Jupiter's crash<br />7. Numb<br />8. Return<br />9. Trap<br />10. This is a lie<br />11. Treasure<br />12. Bare<br /><br />Jupiter's crash and Bare: two of their best ever songs.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I was totally surprised by the whole series after what I was told originally. Well written and not gory, but told a story of heartache, government oppression, and friendship. Hated that it had to end.
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|I just want to thank all of those that pointed out there was no 2D Blu Ray included in this.  I probably would not have noticed and been suckered into buying it.  I will buy the movie once they include both but I don't want to be forced to watch it in 3D if I don't want too.  I've never seen a company do this and it's baffling Disney made this decision.  Disney just lost one customer.  Please do not buy either copy until they address this and include both copies.  Remember you vote with your wallet.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Didn't wait to start after reading The Hunger Games, because I couldn't wait to find out what happened next. Kept my attention and couldn't put it down. Was ready for Mockingjay as soon as I finished this one.
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|not really a kid movie.More of an adult cartoon than kids. Santa has tatoos, the Easter Bunny has attitude. Good message though.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I bought it as a gift and then it has been passed through our family.  It is a great way to watch the series when you don't have cable.
B009ICQ6KO|5.0|a fine collection with two great musicians. A perfect blend of talent that is very easy on the ears and the added DVD is fun
B003L77G06|5.0|It is a great show to watch with your whole family.  The series gets better and better as it goes along.
B0085YOD1A|1.0|I like battery better than battery pro battery gives more info than battery pro! Battery pro is not worth one dollar not even one penny!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Good story, believable.  I really liked it - and I'm not done with it yet!  I liked the challenges the character faces.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Great show full of intrigue but also science and the possibilities .<br />we love watching this one show after a busy day at work
034580404X|5.0|I thought all three books were very interesting and I enjoyed reading them. I am very satisfied with these books.
0810989956|5.0|It was in great condition as stated, and my child is having great fun filling in the pages and working through it.
B00A50PBEA|5.0|i have waited since 2006 for this film to come to America and finally i can add it to my collection....i heard the interview with Sir Ken on WQXR and have just placed my order. Cannot wait for it to arrive.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|Definitely one of the better reads.  Thoughtful and well crafted. Some flaws but what doesn't. Hoping to not have to wait too long for book 3.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I am not certain that someone who is childless woudl be able to feel the sheer terror of this book, unless that childless reader is pining for a child. Each night too suspenseful to stop reading, with me fighting sleep until my eyes shut involuntarily. I was tempted to call out of work to finish!
B00000I41J|5.0|the musicianship suberb, the song choices subtle but clearly meant to showcase the idea that each muscian has to offer.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Watch this before new one! Loved it. The new one is also very good and worth watching. Thank you for reading my review.
B00BIVN82M|1.0|Uninteresting song choices, strident orchestra, and little sense that the album is about anything. Buble flat, boring, lifeless, unimaginative crap
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|I enjoyed this movie and have watched it a couple of time. Lots of action (violence) and blood so be careful with small kids.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|this dungeon crawler game is better then other games in the app store because of the bosses that is in every level.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|He is one of my favorite actors and helped write and produce this movie. can't go wrong with him in the movie.
B000NV55RY|5.0|It's been awhile since I've seen this movie, but it's one of my favorite vampire movies just because it not only includes the &#34;horror&#34; but it's also quite funny.  My favorite character is the old jewish innkeeper and how he couldn't control his urges.  I believe this is the only Roman Polanski movie that I've ever seen but I glad I've got it now.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|Jeez, i hope these two do a show in my area soon. Truly an electric combo!<br />Many of these songs live performances are up on Youtube; hot stuff folks!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Very well put together application.  The ability to overlap many different high quality sounds is nice.  You can set each sound's volume individually.  The optional auto-off timer for the application is also very useful.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I didn't want to spend the money on this app, but would have had I known that it was going to be this good. I really like that it gives you a rough idea on how long you have on the battery. Overall a great app.
B004TI5N38|5.0|David Baldacci is a terrific writer and always keeps one interested so  that the reading of the book fly's by too quickly.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Great app for picking radio stations.  I moved to Virginia about 30 years ago and now I'm able to listen to some old Alabama stations that I used to listen to years ago.  Great to be able to pick up a station that will play the music you like to listen to when you can't get it locally.
B00B5AP7NY|3.0|Bought this thinking it would be as good as the star wars but not quite.<br />Especially if you played the game it's like they took all the scenes stringed them together. Very dry.<br />For none game playes it will work out just fine.
B0063M22QO|5.0|The optional game sets are a plus.  Also, the option to scramble the tiles is a nice feature to encourage the player to finish out the game.
B0064J6OMO|5.0|This is defininitely one of the most hilarious movies I've ever seen! But it is also not a family movie, lots of language.
B008XG1X18|5.0|What a great way to explore new and creative ideas for just about everything. There is never enough time to browse through everything I'm interested in.  I'm hooked!
B00AF6MF9I|1.0|Rank doesn't matter &amp; half the time your weapons don't matter either. This game is crap! Don't waste your time.....  In order to play you have to spend money or it will just by default it seems make you loose battles that shouldn't be lost.
B00CUWKHVI|1.0|As a HUGE fan of Jamie Cullum's earlier works (specifically Twentysomething, which I regard as one of the best albums ever recorded), I'm disappointed that Jamie has again chosen to gear a new album towards so-called \\"progressive, mainstream pop\\". (\\"Progressive pop\\" nowadays is REgressive music, by the way.)  A talent like Jamie Cullum comes around once in a lifetime. And what he is capable of is so far beyond \\"pop,\\" it's not even fair to mention \\"pop music\\" and Jamie Cullum in the same sentence. Or paragraph. Or page. Or book. Or library. Well, you get the point.<br /><br />Cullum is better than Momentum. Much, much better. I only hope he eventually goes back to his jazzier roots (along with doing brilliant covers/remakes like \\"Frontin'\\" and \\"Lover, You Should Have Come Over\\".) It would be wise to bring back Sebastiaan De Krom (drums) and Geoff Gascoyne (bass) if he does so.  That trio was magic.<br /><br />On his album \\"Pointless Nostalgic,\\" there is a track titled \\"I Want to be a Popstar.\\" It's a very tongue-in-cheek tune where Jamie pretends to want to \\"dumb down\\" his sound just to be a pop icon. It's sad to see that maybe he's not \\"pretending\\" anymore.<br /><br />All due respect to Jamie Cullum. The man is an amazing musician and singer. I just want to hear more of what I know he's capable of.<br /><br />Please, Jamie... go back to showcasing what makes you a once-in-a-lifetime singer/musician.  Because you are.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I absolutely loved book three probably more then one and two and I am super mad too have to wait for a book four but overall I'm happy there's another book because I have not had my fill of Gideon and Eva. The sex scenes do not disappoint at all like with some series of books it did not feel to repetitive and boring. This book was hot with a capital H. I would recommend it to anyone into erotic romance.
B00CWVFPGO|1.0|This is really bad, I did not expect much and it was all that and worse. My little sister is banned from picking movies. Forever!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Double tap feature to move the cards is a very nice touch.  I wish the app contained more styles of Solitaire, but I love it anyway.
B008Y7N7JW|1.0|Not good. Plot was not properly thought out in some places.  I also can see why people compared it to another movie made in Japan. It did not seem as if it was written by someone living in this century.
B005EHILV4|4.0|When Apple removed the audio in port from the iMac several years ago, the Behringer UFO202 interface enabled me to  integrate all of my audio equipment without it(there are 2 other very similar models by Behringer--the UCA202 and the UCA222). What sets these interfaces apart from the 302USB is a smaller footprint and a permanently-attached, &#34;dedicated&#34; USB cord.  Simply by plugging the USB cord into a USB port on my iMac enabled me to to record all of the broadcasts, tapes and LPs just as I had done with my old iMac.<br /><br />But then Behringer came to market with the Xenyx 302, which offered me the capability of  playing music while doing &#34;voice-overs&#34; in real time.  Moreover, it offered slider switches--like those in the radio station where I volunteered.  My only disappointment concerns the &#34;build quality&#34; of the switches.  They offer little &#34;grabbing surface&#34; and are anything but smooth in operation.<br /><br />I ordered a larger mixer with big, smooth-gliding slider switches. But it took up so much room on my desk, I realized I'd have little occasion to use it.  So I returned it to Amazon and went back to my UFO202 which, along with the UCA series, is an interface with the tiniest footprint of all (it's still unclear to me that there's any meaningful distinction among the Behringer uCA202, UCA222 and UCA202. They're identical in size and function, though prices vary, and one is red in color).<br /><br />For those who find the &#34;noise&#34; objectionable, Behringer shows this interface with its &#34;twin&#34;, the relatively inexpensive Behringer C-1 mic.  For optimal performance, this mixer should be used with the microphone it was expressly made to complement.ot;thin screen&quot; bragging rights while robbing the user of both money and space--thanks to the new requirement of an external burner).<br /><br />Behringer has presented the best solution I've been able to find to Apple's surprising (and dubious) omissions with the latest iMac.  If your uses include mixing, and if you have the space (we're talking a mere inch or two), the 302USB is no doubt worth an extra ten bucks.  But if you have a UFO or UCA interface, your needs may already be covered.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|This was much better then expected. I enjoyed the show and would recommend it to others.  It was really funny and had a decent puzzle plot.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|If you feel like a slog through Ireland's orphanages from many years ago, this is the book for you. I yearned a little more tenderness for the adults whose stories are told as children in the orphanage.  The sense of place was nice.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Great time playing while relaxing.  And the kids can play with no worries.  Everyone can play no matter what age.
B00BC24NT4|5.0|Le Carre writes in a style unlike any current author.  His prose are superb and his characters have depth and clarity.  The story is compelling and is well worth taking your time to enjoy.  Superb summer reading
B009FZHYKU|5.0|What a fantastic show!! The ending of season 2 was incredible and then it just kept getting better and better. Season 3 started strong and began to weaken towards the end. Can't wait to continue Season 3!!!
B001LM5TUC|5.0|This is an ultra-high quality product. Price is more than fair for what you get. If you, like me, consider &#34;Giant Steps&#34; a milestone recording, you will feel extremely proud of owning this limited edition release. Highly recommended.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|This app is ok. My 5yr old nephew's lke it alot my son's ages 19 to 12  get bord with it fast. I gave it 4 stars because the music it relentless.
B00C9U9YOW|4.0|Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme says that the title for their latest album sarcastically refers to the multiple problems the band faced during its writing and production - that everything went \\"...like clockwork.\\"  They'll have to forgive listeners if they're less than sympathetic, because the result of that strife is a fantastically tight album that puts QOTSA back atop the modern rock world.<br /><br />After 2005's dense, droning (and largely forgettable) \\"Era Vulgaris,\\" - dubbed by Homme as the pinnacle of their \\"robot rock\\" sound - many wondered if the band had run dry of ideas.  \\"...Like Clockwork\\" bridges to that era with the fuzzed-up opener \\"Keep Your Eyes Peeled\\" but then takes off in a completely different direction toward catchy hooks and twisting chords.  While some production elements retain the exacting, synthetic tricks of the past, the material is free to roam in new and interesting directions - an important distinction from \\"Era Vulgaris.\\"<br /><br />The result bears undeniable marks of QOTSA (6/8 time, slide steel guitars, wah-wah pedal, Homme's alternating falsetto vocals) but turns to classic rock for inspiration throughout.  \\"I Sat by the Ocean\\" interplays guitar tracks like Heart, \\"If I had a Tail\\" channels the Stones like a new-millenium \\"Gimme Shelter,\\" and \\"Kalopsia\\" (featuring guest vocals by Trent Reznor) sounds like vintage Bowie on steroids.  The entire album reflects QOTSA's trademark bluesy, horror-movie-meets-circus atmosphere, owing a lot to The Beatles' \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\\" and \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy).\\"  The track \\"The Vampyre of Time and Memory\\" modernizes these influences reminiscing Radiohead's \\"Exit Music (for a Film).\\"<br /><br />Overall, the result is by turns glam, moody, slinky, menacing, pounding, majestic - and pure rock throughout.  You'll stomp your foot and grind your hips to each of the ten tracks.<br /><br />Lyrically, Homme was clearly (and understandably) guided by a near-death experience and lengthy convalescence after routine surgery and the subsequent creative block that he suffered afterward.  Lines like \\"If life is but a dream, wake me up\\" and \\"Shock me awake / Tear me apart / Pinned like a note in a hospital gown / Prison of sleep\\" lay bare his personal struggles.<br /><br />Shame on Matador for the lackluster packaging for \\"...Like Clockwork.\\"  The art is supplied by Liverpool graphic artist Boneface, but there's scant little of it with the album itself.  Several online promotional clips teasing the album set up a conceptual relationship between animated versions of Boneface's nightmarish vision and the music itself, but that promise is left unfulfilled with this package - basically a one-sheet leaflet with no additional art, lyrics or other content.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|Good action and plot twists this season.  The finale stunned and blew me away.  I look forward to next season.
B003G4W49C|5.0|A new concept as this read put you in the seat with the child's thinking and development. Fresh an unimpeded in their growth.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Ted (Unrated) was hilarious.  There were times when I had to stop the movie and rewind a little because I was laughing so hard. Definitely one of my all time favorite silly movies.
0062082353|4.0|Book was very poorly put together and looked like pages were cut off with a pair of pinking shears. It was a sad excuse for a book about an American Hero. It was definitely not a top quallity book ,and the paper is brittle and ywllowed. If I didn;t know better I would have assumed it was second hand book from thrift store off old books.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Very disappointed I have never written a review before but I hate to say it this deserved one..they drag the release of this &#34;much anticipated&#34; book way longer then it should have been when it had no plot.. I'm really bummed because I loved this series but this book sucked! Didn't leave me wanting more I'm over the sex sex sex there needed to be more to the plot.. Such a bummer I really like these characters but don't know if I would buy the next book :/
B009CG939M|5.0|Sci fi, romance and action mix guaranteed to please. Quick paced, good script and action-packed film. If you are looking for a film that is easy to follow, fun to watch and facilitates your escape from reality, look no further...
B00BC24NT4|3.0|Judging only from this writing, I do not see le Carre as more than a journeyman writer. Maybe as someone who with effort could transcend that common realm. Since I share his opinions, I must read with the expectation of being amused or stimulated or otherwise elevated. That has not happened. The text sits on my Kindle next to Herodotus, Charles Sanders Peirce and the Bard. I paid for it thinking of the image of le Carre I had in my mind from the most recent Smiley flick which I enjoyed. But my review must consist of the acknowledgement that it sits there. It is not a page-turner. It seems somewhat tendentious. I am not excited by its characters. And I already know that I agree with the author about the silliness of Iraq and the overblown spy apparatus. Should I return to the text and find some hidden quality I will return to this review and repent. Meanwhile I will see it as a caution to myself since like le Carre I am a moralist trying to change the way people review reality. Doing that isn't easy.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|I think it does a really good job.  It updates itself, also.  Had the best rating of any of the security programs.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|This was everything I hoped it would be: service, shipping, cast, music, production, and value. All I hoped for and more.
B004GYY714|5.0|I finally got it to download to my kindle so now I can rate it.  It is great, and the sound on my Kindle Fire HD is wonderful.  It is a shame that I couldn't get some help from you all when it did not download when I ordered it.  It has taken a month to get it on there, without any help from you.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|A game that is taking over the app stores an amazing and much more fun take on games like temple run five out of five stars
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I still like Crossfire better than 50 Shades, but this book felt like a space filler, if that makes sense. Not enough was going on. I found my myself skimming over the sex scenes waiting for something to happen. I kept feeling it was building up to something, drama or plot twist, but no, I guess that comes in the next book.
0425263924|5.0|I waited in anticipation for the delivery of this installment of the Crossfire series. I was not disappointed. I could not put it down. Gideon is such a wonderful and hot mess all at once. You cannot help but root for these two. I look forward to the next book. Thank You Sylvia!
B005IQZB14|5.0|I had never heard of the book until it was recommended to me.  Enjoyed it.  Had to take a break from it occasionally, though.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this is the best game ever because I beat my high score every minute I have time to play it.
B0036T1RMM|2.0|Don't watch this if you want to be mildly entertained. It's hard to follow the Venn diagram of characters and something happens at the end that makes absolutely no sense. Sure there are signs throughout the movie that point to this occupancy but WHY - makes no sense and has nothing to do with anything. Tom cruise is the best part. I'm giving 2 stars for Tom'a hair.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|There are countless firefly fans out there in the world who will tell you the exact same thing, that this show shouldn't have been canceled. There are also countless firefly fans out there who never had the chance to watch the show when it originally aired.<br />Please, watch these episodes and see how amazing Joss Wedon is and how he brings such power to characters whom you hate to love as much as you do. Mal will take you to the far reaches of the universe in such a short period of time and the finale will leave you with so many unanswered questions that you will want to cry, but you'll go back in a month or two and rewatch them all because these characters in such a short time have ripped their ways into your hearts.<br />This is a show that brings people together, and that just shows you how amazing Joss is that he could do this to all of us fans, that he could make us connect with every character to the point that even ten years from now someone is going to be fighting to bring firefly back.

B009KS4XRO|5.0|Don't get caught up in it though. You lose track of time trying to get more daubs without spending money
B0029LCJJS|3.0|The show is interesting to watch even if it Isn't entirely accurate.  It is pornographic and very violent.  I had to mute an turn away at least once per episode.  I have no interest in viewing those things.
B0012NO316|5.0|Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton do a great job in this Edward Albee play for the screen. Other performances of note include George Segal and Sandy Dennis. I love this show because there's so much symbolism in it. It's not a happy show but it's fascinating trying to figure out what everything means. Each time I watch it I see more.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|I have not completed it.  He does not whitewash Steve, either.  Maybe it's an example of an objective biography, if that is even possible.  I've not read any other book on the topic and am about halfway done with this one.  I recommend it, period!
1451695195|4.0|I've given it 4 star rating given the frankness and honesty. However, the book does not contain any revelations, not in my opinion. What the author experienced already had an awareness noting with interest similarities between his understanding and mine. Yes, I would recommend this book to anyone who has an open mind towards the afterlife...

B00CXN2JNS|3.0|I have been a Megadeth fan since the 80's. Most of their albums are decent, some not so much. I feel the last few albums are just bits and pieces of all their previous songs chopped and rehashed, lacking the magical ingredient that made them great...Marty Friedman.

0307352145|5.0|I have just read QUIET: The Power of Introverts, again. This follows discovering a TEDTALK featuring the author Susan Cain. I feel you will nod your head all the way through, as if, she were talking to you. I highly suggest reading the book for understanding high sensitivity and the value of being an introvert.
B004IYWN7C|5.0|My brother and I loved this movie when we were young. I rented this for my son and I cracked up while watching because I knew it was a good movie, but forgot how extremely hilarious it is. The songs come right back to you and it's hard to not burst out singing aloud. My son loves this movie also. &#34;CHEDDAAAA&#34;
B005LLSNNE|5.0|This series is the best that I have ever seen.  Very intense.  All of the actors are deep..Love it.  It has my 5 star review.
B008JAGZDE|3.0|I don't know if it wasn't as good as the other movies, if I am just over the saga, or if I got too old. Whatever the case, it just didn't hold my attention. I replayed it twice and just found myself over it.

B0049J2BSM|5.0|My son is 23 months old and is obsessed with this movie, we have actually rented this a few times because he points at the tv and says raaaawwwrrrr, we will be ordering the DVD for his birthday.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Ok, it was hotter than a pancake griddle in the dogdays of August.  More than that, though, it was psychologically truthful and ... here's here's the hard part ... plain honest.  The author wasn't guessing how a scene woul feel and trying to play it out it convincingly . She knew. And she wasn't  afraid to tell it.  The result ...  total immersion in Anastasia's world. When the last page was turned, I was clawing for page one and a reread. So often I read a book and as a former counseling clinician, I'm tutting, That's not how it would really be. This time  I was crying and thinking that fifty shades of screwed up were never so heart wrenchingly rendered.
B002361MLA|1.0|This is the only book of this kind that I listened to on audio instead of reading it myself. The audiobook is read by the author. I liked his ideas, though they are not really his own. They are of mostly Eastern origin, he simply repackaged and renamed them and presented them as his own. That didn't bother me too much as many authors of books of this sort do that. I do practice meditation and know about chi energy. I completely understand what he is trying teach with this book and agree with much of it.<br /><br />What I didn't like about this book was the way the author presented \\"his\\" ideas. His tone was haughty and cool. His writing, I could tell, by his reading, was repetitive and vague. His audio set was seven disks. He could have presented all of his material in about two or three of them, if he'd got to the point. I was also put off and surprised by his negativity. His view of the human race, human relationships, and even women's menstrual cycle were negative to an excessive degree.<br /><br />I've read books on energy, healing, and Eastern teachings before. I've listened to audiobooks before. NEVER have I ever had a book on this type of subject create such negative energy as Tolle's did. I had to stop listening to him by disk four or five because the negative energy coming from his reading just became too draining. I cannot recommend this author.

0596805888|5.0|I bought this as a gift. It appears to be well loved by my nerdy boyfriend, I'd recommend it for those with a science background
0425263924|4.0|Generally, these aren't the kind of books I normally read. I'll pick up adult fiction every now and again, but erotica is a little different. I don't stay away from it as a rule or anything, mostly because it's not really my thing, but every once in a while I'll want to read something outside of my comfort zone. The only real reason I picked up the first book in the Crossfire series, Bared To You, is because my friend told me it was sort of like Fifty Shades of Gray (a book I wanted to like, but ended up hating with a passion), only much, much better. I wanted to see if the plot could actually be done right, and Sylvia Day has definitely managed it. Her books just have this raw feeling infused in them that just make everything seem so raw.<br /><br />I've always liked Eva. Despite the fact that her boyfriend is one of the richest men in the world, she still tries to be very independent and stands up for herself. She was exactly the kind of heroine I wanted when I was reading that previously mentioned Other Book. Gideon Cross is the best kind of hot, complex male lead in the story. He does have his faults, and though their relationship may not exactly be healthy all the time, the two of them really do the best they can given the circumstances, and I just love how much they care for each other. The author is no stranger to writing killer love scenes, and it most certainly shows.<br /><br />What I loved about Entwined With You is that there was no horrible break-up parts like there are in the previous books. That was what really got under my skin in Reflected In You; both of them always seemed to be jumping to conclusions about one thing or another before either had a chance to explain themselves. But in this installment, they somehow manage to stay together the entire book. And this is part of the reason that EWY is my favorite of them all so far. Everything that E&G have to deal with comes from their awful pasts, and some things they brought on themselves (mostly from Gideon's side, like his issues with Corrine and Anne), and some things they did not. I felt really bad for them watching one thing spring up after another.<br /><br />Something else I really appreciate are the side characters. I can't help but notice that in most novels like these the main two characters are always the most important and everyone else is just sort of there in the background. And while this is true to some extent with the Crossfire series, at the same time I grew to care a lot about the others, especially Cary. For me, this is one of the things that sets these books apart from the genre as a whole. I thought this was going to be a three-book series, but at the end, there is an author's note saying she will write more - and I was so relieved! There are still a bunch of things that haven't happened yet, and their story didn't feel like it was over at all.

B00881VLCE|4.0|I enjoy puzzles, and this is a way for me to interact with them to relax. It's fairly easy to use. Just a little learning curve. After that it's simple. Thank you.
B00BF11STU|5.0|Not at all what I expected.  I was very moved by how honest about the good and bad things that happened after 9/11; we did some horrible things as a country and the movie shows the \\"positive\\" and negative it eventually brought.  The movie does not go into  politics or make a political statement; just a few peoples honest perspective from inside the hunt for Bin Laden.
B001AQQR2S|4.0|My kids love this movie. It is funny, sweet and wholesome.  It's definitely a movie worth having in your collection
B008GGA5EQ|5.0|Absolutely fascinating and very well written<br /><br />Written in first person this is an intriguing and hard edged story of a young woman who becomes Chengi. We never find out her real name. She's taken by people smugglers after swimming out to an island, and so begins an adventure of self-discovery, sex, and subservience. Chengi's story is a darkly erotic one where she enjoys being the object of desire and willingly gives in to the many sexual encounters. The book does have a fairy story quality about it despite being, gritty and hardcore, because there is a young Sheik who falls in love with Chengi, and of course a further adventure awaits her in the harem.<br />Excellently written, frequent sex scenes, and an intriguing story lift this book out of fairy tale into a blend of erotica that is surprising. It is dark, it is hard, and touches on the reality of the sex slave trade we all know exists, with an ending that is extremely poignant.
0385504225|4.0|Though it's no literary masterpiece, The Lost Symbol is certainly a page-turner that will pull you right through all 600+ pages. I read it soon after returning from a visit to Washington, D.C. and enjoyed scenes set in places where I had just been.

159463176X|4.0|\\"There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear involves torment.\\" -- 1 John 4:18 (NKJV)<br /><br />Regardless of your ultimate view of this book, I think you'll agree that pages 1 through 49 are as well written as anything you've read in a long time. Bravo, Mr. Hosseini! They are a remarkable achievement!!<br /><br />While anyone would envy an author who accomplished so much to open a novel, there's a problem. Readers expect the rest of the book to maintain that remarkably high standard.<br /><br />I believe that Mr. Hosseini has the talent to do so. The plot for this book, its scope, and length make it impossible to do so. You couldn't write War and Peace in many fewer words ... or a Tale of Two Cities. And the Mountains Echoed needs to be two or three times longer to flesh out his plan for the book.<br /><br />Without that length, the book comes across as a series of short stories briefly connected to one or the other of the two siblings in the book's beginning, Abdullah and Pari. Each story is its own morality tale about how we treat other people, including those in our families. Within the whole book there are themes connecting suffering, responsibility, and morality. Some characters adhere to timeless values, at least in parts of their lives, while others talk a good game ... but don't act in accord with their words. The result is a tapestry capturing Afghanistan yesterday and today against a backdrop of humanity over all times.<br /><br />One of the book's major accomplishments is to present some of the most thought-provoking writing I recall about how appearance affects our lives and our behavior. I would love to see Mr. Hosseini return to this subject in future books. He obviously has a deep understanding that can inform us all.<br /><br />But please do write a book next time that's as long as your subject deserves, Mr. Hosseini! We'll read it.
0739368435|5.0|I am amazed!  This is the first I have known about the WW2 occupation of the island of<br />Guernsey off the coast of Britain.  Born at the end of the war i thought that I had peeked into a great many of the events of those years.  I certainly missed that one.  The story is well written with an engaging cast of characters.
0670014893|3.0|\\"A faithful witness does not lie,<br />But a false witness will utter lies.\\" -- Proverbs 14:5 (NKJV)<br /><br />John Le Carr&eacute; has lost none of his ability to imagine, describe, and develop compelling characters that advance what he likes. You'll remember several of these characters for some time to come, I'm sure. I was most impressed.<br /><br />He also presents the plotting and execution of secret tasks in nimbly realistic and memorable ways.<br /><br />I thought the book went very wrong, however, in characterizing those representing what Mr. Carr&eacute; doesn't like and in plotting the actions that they take. These parts of the book weren't just poorly done; they were impossible to swallow.<br /><br />Consequently, the book presents a mixture of writing that might characterize Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde alternating as coauthors. The mixture was most unsatisfying for me.<br /><br />I would have liked the book better if I had stopped reading around page 200. I don't remember having that reaction to any of Mr. Le Carr&eacute;'s earlier works.
1451695195|5.0|It was confirmation to me for what happened to me. When I was a kid I was by a car while on a motorcycle. I knew it was going to happen but went anyway. I was given a choice to stay here or go with him (male voice asked). I choose to come back and remained silent for years. I have no fear of death there is nothing to fear.

And they dis have their problems but for this book I didnt expect it to end the way it did it. I expected a better cliff hanger I was just dissapointed but I still love Sylvia days work. So I will possibly read the 4th one when it arrives
B000O178BY|1.0|I really don't see what everyone is raving about. I tried to like this album but after several attemps it dawned on me I should'nt have to \\"try\\". Year Zero is best described as music without  all those \\"instruments\\" getting in the way. Any real instruments are so computer distorted as to be unrecognizable. I wonder how he plays this stuff live. I guess he sits on a stool with his laptop. If you like distorted noise instead of layered instrumentation than you will love this record. Considering the over the top glowing reviews I'm either in the minority, Or it has gotten to the point where Trent could record himself taking a dump and it would be considered musical genius by many fans. Bottom line is if you like the heavier NIN like the Fragile, Broken, Pretty Hate Machine, This is not the album to buy IMO.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Connelly is still the master.  I love his character, Harry Bosch.  Connelly weave an intriguing tale with turns and twists to keep you wondering what is going to happen next.  Brilliant.
B002N2LEVM|5.0|I had seen a few of the shows here and there, mainly due to a busy schedule, but found them to be based on a pretty great idea.  Of course belief would need to be suspended on a few things, but it was an entertaining show with decent casting.  Alan Tudyk was perfect for the Alpha role.  2 seasons was to short...<br /><br />It was a great show, but the ending was a bit odd (as all endings tend to be)... having to close the doors and answer all the questions in such a short time isn't easy, but again for me it was just great entertainment.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|Entwined with You  (Crossfire #3)<br /><br />by Sylvia Day<br />If you're like me, then you have been waiting with bated breath for seven months for Entwined With You, the third book in the Crossfire series by Sylvia Day. You counted down the weeks, the days and even the minutes until you could reunite with Gideon Cross and Eva Trammel. When the book appeared on my e-reader I screamed with excitement. As I began reading, I fell in love with Gideon and Eva all over again. Entwined With You was definitely worth the wait.<br /><br /> Entwined With You is absolutely not a standalone. There is too much history with the characters to follow the novel without reading Bared To You and Reflected In You.<br /><br /> If you are expecting happily ever after at the end of Entwined with You then you will be disappointed. Entwined With You does conclude with Eva and Gideon together so there is no relationship cliffhanger. Several storylines have been wrapped up, but there are enough new ones and new questions to fill up another book. And in fact, Ms. Day has announced on her website that Entwined With You is not the last book in the series, but that she actually has plans for two more books. And while this may leave you frustrated, the good news is that we don't have to say goodbye to Gideon and Eva. That is certainly cause for celebration because I have grown to care for these two damaged but passionate people. I just hope that the wait is not as long this time.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|First game in 2 years of daily free apps that has been worth downlding. At times frustrating trying to do the hang of it but so worth it. I wish there was more to it but I like games that have defined end points, this one does from the beginning. I feel I will still play it as a time waster but there is no in-game motivation to play any after completing it.

B0094K20FK|4.0|Still a favorite after all these years!  Just went to see the new movie Into Darkness, so I re-watched this one afterwards.  The new Khan, although done very well in the new version, would not have aged into the old Khan we know and love.  Ricardo Montalban certainly had a presence.  Loved all the older Star Trek movies!

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love this book, this series and this auther.  I am completely thrown by all the one star reviews.  I admit I did read a lot of reviews before I purchased this book and I almost didn't buy it.  I like a ot of you expected this to be the end of the series and was disappointed that it was not, but the more I thought about it the more I realized I am not ready to give up Gideon and Eva.  Why would I?  They are hot and fun.  I noticed that most of the one star reviews came from people who never actually read the book.  I don't think that is fair to other readers who read reviews before puchasing books, and want HONEST opinions of the BOOK.  A review should be of the story NOT the author.  So here is my HONEST review of the BOOK.<br />I absolutley love this story.  It picks up where we left off.  Gideon and Eva are still trying to find out who they are when they are together.  There is a ton of sex in this book, at some points I did start to think it was a little over kill but than I thought if I just got back my soul make hopefully we would be the same way.  You can really feel the depth of Gideons love for Eva, even though this is from her POV.  Does eva make mistakes in this book?  Yes. Does Gideon? Of course.  they are still learning to trust and love one another. For them this relationship is so new. There are a few twists and turns in this book and we are blessed to have some more insit into other people in this book.  I feel a lot happens in such a short amount of time. Some people you hope to never see again are back, but that just makes for a more interesting story.  What would a book be without a little trouble and some villians? What we as readers have to remember is that everything has happened over a very short amount of time.  Gideon and Eva have fallen in love quickly, it just seems like the have known each other longer.  I for one am willing to wait for the HEA, knowing these things take time.  I can not wait for the next book to come out, and I defiantly be buying it no matter what others think.  Thank you Sylvia Day for such a great story.
B00C5W3SBE|4.0|\\"I know I'm not the wizard you were expecting, but I might just be the wizard you need.\\" Oz (Franco) is a struggling magician in a little town in Kansas. After being chased by a jealous man he hops into a hot air balloon for an escape and soon finds himself face to face with a twister. When it's all over he finds himself in a strange land called Oz. This is a movie that I was looking forward to seeing but was a little hesitant. One reason was that I love the Wizard Of Oz and was afraid this would ruin the mystique of that movie. The other reason was I wasn't sure how you make a prequel to a movie that was a dream in the first place. That out of the way I really enjoyed this a lot. The characters are great and the movie really does a great job of setting up what will be seen in the Wizard Of Oz. This is a really good family movie even though there are a few pretty creepy parts in this. Overall, a very good movie that deserves to carry the title of Oz. I highly recommend this movie. I give it an A-.
B009O35XME|3.0|I'm a big Gaiman fan but have mixed feelings about this one.  I reread it after realizing that I didn't remember a thing about it.  Now I see why.  Avoiding spoilers, it has a creative vision of mythology in the modern world and interesting characters and short stories within stories, Neil's signature.  The main character, Shadow, is odd though because he lacks any kind of motivation beyond generic goodness and a sense of duty, as is reflected in his name, a conscious choice by the author.  Normally motivations drive drama and so with little motivation, the drama ends up flat.  Even his major act of choice comes across as little more than mechanical duty despite it being described otherwise.  Later, he gives up on his one goal with scarcely a second thought.  There was a potential to have contrasted his passivity with the gods who, we are told, are defined in some manner as embodying their totem principle, whether love or thunder or whatever.  As being in some sense defined by and perhaps prisoners of a central passionate motivation.  Instead this potential theme was never realized and although there are the expected motions at the end of both character growth and a better world, arguably neither is true.  Shadow is still Shadow and the world seems relatively unchanged for all the theatrics along the way.  Is it better to live as a man or as a god?  unclear.  the gods seem miserable but it turns out the humans just wish to be dead,  So enjoyable as only Gaiman can deliver and yet somehow without nourishment, like nutrasweet.

B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Finished the book theww days ago and wanted to let it simmer before writing a review.  First let me say, I knew there would be two more books to follow before this one was released.  I don't have any \\"inside\\" scoop it was publicized and frankly I was glad to hear it.  I just don't want this story to end.  My 4 star rating (really more of a 4.5) is solely based on my 5 star ratings for books one and two.  I thoroughly enjoyed EWY but just not as much as the first two (with one exception) and here's why:<br /><br />*More fluff less story.  There were a lot of little things going on that I'm not certain will be carried over into the next two books which makes me think there's fluff that didn't need to be there.  BUT I'm also sure some of it will go further so we'll just have to wait and see what develops.<br /><br />*Gideon and Eva are not just insatiable they are....I have no idea what word to use but beyond insatiable  (insert word here LOL) and for me it got a little bit repetitive.  Disclaimer:  Sylvia Day is one of the best at writing sensual scenes so did I skip those parts HELL NO!<br /><br />*There was a part of me that lost some love for Eva (don't want to spoil here by sharing my reasons).  AND that bothered me because I didn't want that to happen but...apparently Sylvia wants me to doubt Eva so I'm going with it.<br /><br />*Price...I must say I rarely spend this kind of money for an e-book but I'm a Sylvia Day fan so I will continue to do so unless she really lets me down.  This book did not let me down.  But I totally get the complaints about price from other reviewers.<br /><br />Here's my exception Gideon is FREAKING AWESOME!  You do not want to miss who Gideon is in book 3.  He is over the top MINE MINE MINE!<br /><br />Cannot wait to see how this story continues and hope we don't have to wait too long for book 4. Looking forward to lots of \\"significant\\" pages especially if the book is going to be expensive. I have no doubt there will be a happy ending.  But seriously who wants this to end?But seriously who wants this to end?
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Loved Loved this movie Jamie Foxx of course being one of my fave actors singer etc.....It was a different speed from what I usually watch but loved it anyway.
B003NRYMZQ|5.0|I am not generally a sci-fi/fantasy person, but I love the characters in this series, and, I love the Welsh accents. That's what got me watching it in the first place. I'm Welsh on my father's side, so a show set in Cardiff, with some of the actors having that lovely accent...I was hooked.  And, &#34;Jack Harkness&#34; is lovely. :-)  The show is never dull. If you want to watch something restful that will put you to sleep, this show isn't it!  The plots are great and as believable as anything can be with aliens in it.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Excellent writing and an awesome cast, was very surprised and happy i started watching this show.You must see this show if you haven't
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved the book as much as the last two.  I can't wait until the next book to find out what happens to Eva, Gideon and Cary.  I just might have to read it again and again as I wait!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|One of the most riveting shows of our time. The characters are engaging, believable and evolve with each series in amazing ways.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is my second watching of the 2nd season.  I love the historic backdrop of WWI.  Watch it, love it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this multi-device app. It helps keep my every day organized. From grocery lists to check-off lists. (!!!and I can even add pica to my lists!!!)
B003Y5H5C4|4.0|The comedy in this film is just priceless. Danny McBride's weird sense of humor adds an awkwardness in its own. Anziz and Jesse make a perfect combination of awkard and hilarity that makes this film an instant favorite. I personally could watch it over and over again. If you love laughing and have a good sense of humor then buy this movie.
B008JJM88Q|2.0|I've been playing this game for a couple days now and it's ok...when it actually works. It has crashed at least 7 times today...after that I lost track. If it didn't crash as much as it did, it would be fun (though I wouldn't pay $1.99 for it)
B000FC2KL0|5.0|Well-written and captivating! I would recommend it to anyone, especially if you like the red hot chili peppers! Dream of californication.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Fannibal at first bite.  The characters and the plot drew me in, and like a rabid dog, won't let me go.
B002YCVX5S|4.0|This is an interesting way to tell the story.  Overall, I thought this was interesting and the action was real.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Haven't been playing long but so far this game is alot of fun! Expect it will only get better as i get into it  more
B00A77II0U|1.0|I played 3 G5 games that were the same kind of game. So I figured I would try this one based on the reviews. I played for 5 minutes and deleted it. I felt like I was playing a game from 1990. I'll stick with the much more fun G5 games. Very disappointing, I want my money back!
B00992CF6W|5.0|i lovve this app would reccomend to others hope people love it like i do not as goood  as pc but it is perfect on the go
B008K7PS1Q|4.0|I was really looking forward to hearing this CD. Being a fan of sister Charlotte Gainsbourg I was expecting a lot and am not disapointed. I look forward to more releases from her.
B008NEVPCC|5.0|Love her hit and I decieded to buyt he Cd I was not diapointeed, she has many great songs, this album is worth it!
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|I am enthralled with this movie.  I was hesitant, at first, since I had no prior knowledge of this movie. The 3 hour length was just another reason for me to give it pause before watching, but I had exhausted the other entertainment options I normally use, and was up for something different.<br /><br />Without turning this into a long, drawn-out monologue, I will say that it was breathtaking, for me.  I can't speak to Karma and Buddhist themes, and frankly, if you are looking for something, you will eventually find it.  I don't know much about, nor care to learn, all of the philosophies involved in this story.  The point is, on its own, it is a great story.<br /><br />It was told in a unique fashion, but this is not the first time a movie has jumped timelines.  I loved the interlinked characters across 700 years.  History to sci-fi, revolution and freedom.<br /><br />Take the time to enjoy it.  It is worth it, and if you take the time to understand the story, then you won't be disappointed.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I'm in the process of reading the books and the show lives up to them.  My only negative is that the actress that plays Cat is a bit older than what the book might indicate, and they tried to age the kids to make up for it but they didn't quite pull it off.  Tyrion Lannister is a hoot both in the book and on TV; kudos to the producers for hiring him!
B00B5P37IG|1.0|I thought I would be able to have lots of other tv viewing options.  However, this is only Christian and foreign channels.  Another waste of money.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Hard to imagine how the writers come up with such plots!  Hard to turn it off from one session to the next!
B00BIVN82M|3.0|His latest offering somewhat lacks the smooth Buble tone.<br />A bit strident in places--but still worth a listen for this longtime fan.
B00009RAJH|5.0|This CD is what I expected, good stuff, a must have if you are a Fleetwood Mac fan, enjoy the music
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Only really complete as a  trilogy, I was pleased and surprised by the end.  This is no cotton candy love story.  Having read a lot about terrible things that still happen in so many places, I didn't find this as far fetched a dystopian society as others might.  Worth a read.
B00AGKHEUI|5.0|Enjoyed this very much, but I am a Fleetwood Mac Fan, so they can't go wrong by me, buy it if you want to hear great music
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Simple, functional - exactly what an app should be. I like being able to check the status of the battery and know how much time I may have before I need to connect the charger.
1608871452|5.0|Wonderful pictures and interviews with the cast and crew. Postcards and inserts make this even better. I'm a big fan of the show, and this is a great addition to my collection.
B001B3MCQK|5.0|I am from Detroit, Michigan and I use to sneak in the the bars at the age of 11 and12 just to hear Rodriquez sing and to this day he is my favorite signer and his words to his songs were to me even better the Bob Dylan's, to have a talent such as his is totally amazing to me! I live in New York and I hope to get back to Detroit , Mi and now that I am older (56) I can legally go back to the local bars in Detroit and hope to hear Mr. Rodriquez sing again in person! He is one of the best!
B005DZ35RC|3.0|Movie was too dark for my grandchildren. The original movie with Gene Wilder was much better. I have nothing else to say.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have the 0.7.1 update on my ipod and it needs to come out on kindles because it gets boring after awile . BUT I LOVE MINECRAFT
B007BVOEPI|5.0|This show is amazing. The writing is very tightly woven, and the actors are superb. The violence is a bit gratuitous, but it is appropriate in light of the storyline. I can't believe I waited all this time to watch it. I am definitely a fan now! I've got some catching up to do now. Season 2 here I come.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|It's a mysterious movies with many twists and turns.<br />Loyalty is always a question mark being challenge by many who wanted to serve their master.
B0064MGU98|5.0|This is a great series! Intellectually interesting and well done!! Highly recommended for all!! Almost addictive!! Well worth it!! Watch!!
1587143879|5.0|The combo is great videos Practice labs study Guide and once you have a copy of Mind maps you should be good to go
B000I543T6|5.0|Without a doubt in the top ten movies of a time! From the acting and directing, the rags to riches storyline and the right amount of violence. I seen this when it first came out and love it as much now as I did then! A MUST SEE for movie fans!
B0076D21O2|5.0|Yet another in the long line of theories portending to answer the mystery of the TRUE authorship of the collection of writings attributed to William Shakespeare. A veritable comedy of errors, it unravels the mystery one thread at a time stringing together all the bits and pieces into a finished and mostly coherent if not altogether entirely plausible answer, revealing once and for all the true identity of Anonymous.
B004V9MU86|5.0|This was a difficult and painful topic but Markus approached it from an unusual point of view, taking the reader on a special journey.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|I liked it! This was definitely your typical Hollywood &#34;A-List&#34; Comedy. Fun as a lighthearted distraction. Bring Your Own Popcorn.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|In the beginning we are all for Jacob giving him the benefit of the doubt.  Then, we all start to wonder if he really did it and does it have anything to do with the violence gene.  I actually looked up my own family secret Sociopathy and the propensity for it to be genetic.  Scary!!!!
B001DM1VXE|3.0|I viewed the entire film. It has an interesting premise and seems a little like a pre-cursor to the TV series &#34;Touch&#34;. I was a bit put off by how the production team chose to depict the main character's mental breakdown. It was almost enough to send me to the asylum!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I pre-ordered this book months ago, after being hooked by the previous two. And I waited until Friday night to read it, savoring it for a time when I could dive right in. Well, so much for that. I couldn't believe the thin story line. A Nathan shocker and a missing Megumi. So what?! And for the author to set us up for another book (or two I hear)...what a sucker I am. As far as I'm concerned, this \\"series\\" ended with Reflected In You. I'm going to get rid of this one and never read another book by this author. Really too bad. My residual love for these characters from the prior books are the only reason this one gets 2 stars instead of one.
B006O2QNOU|4.0|A fitting example of Human Nature, this film reveals the inner working inside the Wall Street elite corporate power towers of yesterday's broken financial system of corruption and greed. They did fix the system, right???
B005H9B44A|5.0|I like syfi it's fun I liked this show because it kept me awake and laughed at it some silly writing.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Pretty good, tells me when to charge and i can see the percentage. I only had this app for one day and it is great
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|well worth the cost......excellent plots and challenges.....enjoy the real life situations and how these challenges are met and dealt with.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is definitely worth the seven dollars!i would recommend this app it has spiders,skeletons,zombies,and don't forget...CREEPERS!!!!! It also has creative so if u enjoy PC minecraft or xbox 360 minecraft then i recommend u buy the pocket edition its worth it guys! Also when is the 0.7.0 update coming for kindle edition do u guys know??
B001DM1VXE|5.0|For years Pi has stood out in my mind as the quintessential good inde film. Highly provocative and rewatchable,  it is among my favorite movies ever made (inde or otherwise).
B002QE3CTY|5.0|James Dashner balanced breathtaking \\"trials\\" with many conflicting emotions making you feel as if you were in the book. Looking for Adventure? Journey to the Glade.....If you dare....
B0041WVTBM|4.0|I was born in the year Big Chill came out.  Thirty years later, I can relate.  Not much changes between generations.
1469220725|2.0|Oh....where to start???<br /><br />First, I am in the minortiy in that I truly don't mind that there are going to be 5 books. I follow Sylvia on twitter so I knew this information a few weeks ago and I was actually excited. Originally she was not sure if there would even be a book 4. I figured she must have gotten to writing book 3 and realized she just had too much story and didn't want to cram it in. To quote Gideon's apparently new (and way out of character) phrase, \\"Ummm...\\"  No.<br /><br />Second, I don't' even mind paying the $50 vs the $30.  $10 a book is pretty steep anyway and it bugs me that often the kindle version of a book is more expensive than the paperback but, it's that way across the board.  That's why I'm very selective about which books I will buy on kindle.  I have a lot of issues with the fact that, even after paying more for it, I don't really own it and I can't do with it what I want to. But, anyway, that is for another topic.  If the stories are good, they are worth the $$ and I'll be happy to pay it.<br /><br />Third, the delayed release date.  Yes, this was very frustrating for it to be moved twice. But, again, I just throught, \\"Wow, she's just got so much story , she needs more time\\".  Not. It. At. All.  Truth is, once she signed her life away and agreed to 5 books, she realized that she had NO STORY for book 3 and needed  more time to add fluff and filler.<br /><br />I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED the first 2 books. I have read them 3 times, one of those in preparation for this release.  Even on my 3rd reading, the stories, especially book 2, held my attention and I couldn't wait to get back to it when I had to put it down.<br /><br />Now, on to the book 3 reivew:<br /><br />SPOILERS! SPOILERS! SPOILERS!<br /><br />It started out well enough.  Though I thought Gideon moving next door was kind of silly and contrived, that turned out to be a decent idea that offered some sweet moments.  It is creepy to me how he re-creates her room and her home but...I can overlook that I guess.<br /><br />I flew through the first few chapters, annoyed that they never really discussed that he KILLED SOMEONE FOR HER, but confiedent that I would get to the meat of the story soon enough.  As usual, Gideon and Eva talked around topics and never really landing on anything concrete because they're too busy being so turned on by each other that they can't even get through one conversation with it ending in sex .  I wanted them to have a real conversation about it . I wanted to know how he planned it, what he did, what it was like for him. We got none of that. The explanation the detective gives at the end of book 2 is the most information we got about what Gideon did.  He never said, and Eva never asked.<br /><br />I kept reading, kept figuring that SOMETHING was going to happen...any minute now.  Just when it would seem like a situation was being set up...nothing. It would fizzle on the vine. The tracker in the compact, for example. I first thought that was a bug and that the cops had planted it on Eva to catch her and Gideon discussing the murder.  That would have been interesting. But nope.  It was just nosy Monica again, and a \\"plot\\" device used to manufacture drama.<br /><br />Also, I don't need Eva and Gideon to be mad at each other all the time but some angst, some emotion other that not being able keep their clothes on would have been nice.  So, Gideon does't get mad that Eva agrees to go to the video launch with Brett, doesn't get mad that Eva goes on an actual date with Brett??  I thought he was upset over watching the video but it turns out that, nope, he only left and ditched his date with Ireland because Corrine went crazy.  Also, Eva just lets it go that Gideon left the freaking state and did not call her - his wife!- or even tell her for days?<br /><br />Don't even get me started on the wedding.  I was hoping Eva would turn him down just so there would be something going on.  Not to mention that it is waaaay too soonfor them to be married.  And the prenup? Another opportunity for some kind of drama between the two and...nothing.  The whole document just makes it so basically Gideon is paying Eva to stay with him and give him children and, again, Eva just lets is all go with barely a discussion.<br /><br />I get that Eva and Gideon are dysfunctional, way to co-dependent, way too needy, damanged, etc. But they should be working towards NOT being like that.  They are both just enabling the others issues, not doing anything to try and get better and move forward. The way they are with each other is not healthy, not normal. They should both be able to function normally without the other one for a little while. They should be able to just hang out, talk, whatever, without the need to constantly rip each other's clothes off. Just when I'd think they were finally going to talk about someone, anything...they start going at it like rabbits again. And if I have to hear about how virile Gideon is again...<br /><br />Good luck in managing to find what little excuse for a plot there is through all the love scenes.  My goodness.  I'm not a prude but I do not need to read about every single time in grand and frankly sometimes disgusting detail.  It's just too much. Most of these scenes were just straight up nasty, not sweet or romantic.  Even as rough as FSoG got, it was never nasty or dirty.  C & A were always very sweet with each other. The \\"Cross\\" series is straigtht up porn, the scenes are written in a much more raw way. I could put up with it in the other books because they fit in, the story was good and, frankly, they weren't as nasty as they are in Book 3.  There were a few scenes (the later one on the plane, for example) where  I was screaming Crossfire to myself just because I wanted it to stop.  There is no need to be so graphic about it. Do people really like reading about it in that much detail???<br /><br />While I'm on this topic, there are  3 \\"C\\" words that need to be removed from this series, or at least greatly cut back. They are used way too much.  The first one, a description of the femaie anatomy is, frankly, insulting and degrading to women.  I cringe every time Gideon says it and if a man said that to me he'd get a slap in the face.  The second, a description of the male anatomy and, also, anything that might come out of said anatomy -- I mean , I get that it has to be referred to, that they have to call it something but there are ways to write about what is going on without the constant use of this word.  The 3rd, another word for climax, and all variations  -- really??? The constant announcements and proclamations that it was about to happen. Ugh. I don't have the most experience in the world but I can't imagine people really make a point of announcing this every time or discussing it constantly.  it was just way too much.<br /><br />These scenes being so frequent and so over- the-top graphic really took me out of them all together. I was too busy rolling my eyes or being disgusted or even skimmimg over it while thinking \\"blah, blah, blah...here we go again\\".  If I skimmed over every one in this book, there'd only be about 30% left to read. Seriously it's like someone told Sylvia that her love scenes were her strong suit and she amped them up to ridiculous levels for this book.<br /><br />This book also has even more similarities to FSoG.  I will never believe that Ms. Day didn't at least get some of her ideas from that series. While the \\"Cross \\" series is much better written, the similarities are too frequent to be a conicidence.  Now we have bondage,even more submssive talk, an ex that is officially crazy, Gideon becoming even more possessive,  plus other scenes and situations that were just too similar to be by accident. At least FSoG had a story that kept me entertained and involved.  Also, I know Ms. Day watches the TV show Scandal because she tweets about it. it's one of my favorite shows and Olivia and Fitz are the best couple on TV right now -- their chemistry will literally melt your tv screen. I've watched some of their scenes over and over, so I'm very famiiar with them.  There were two instances in this book where Eva and Gideon say lines almost ver batam to what Oliva and Fitz on Scandal have said to each other.  Again, no way that's an acccident.<br /><br />Like someone else said, I don't care about Megumi or WIll or Mark's engagement.  There was waaaay too much time spent on that. We got, what,  3-4 scenes of Eva and Will making lunch plans.  Really??<br /><br />Also, I LOVED Cary in the other books. He was very unlikeable for the most part in this book. Granted, Eva is treating him like dirt. He's right, you don't announce you are moving on a voicemail.  But I HATE the Tatiana storyline all together and could not care less about her being pregnant.  Similarly, I don't care that Corrine was pregnant.  I almost wish it was GIdeon's just to add some drama to the story.  Then there was all this build up about Corrine's husband and, again, nothing came of it.<br /><br />Speaking of fake drama, literally the whole book was builiding towards something happening with this reporter and an expose and then all GIdeon does is take her out for one drink and suddenly her revenge is forgotten and she's helping him out??? Really????<br /><br />I can't even discuss the fact that Eva still has all these feelings for Brett either. After everything with Gideon, how can she even look at Brett??? The Brett story has potential to make things more interesting but he's just becoming pathetic. Let it go, man, just let it go.<br /><br />I can't add anything more about the awful ending. It literally stopped mid-scene with no cliffhanger or anything. It. Just. Stopped.<br /><br />I'm giving this 2 stars instead of one because I still like the characters and I'll continue with the series. I just hope there are actual events in the next books. I don't think any of us can take 2 more like this one.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I was s Skeptical. But I wanted to watch something for free on Amazon prime so I gave it a try. Glad I did! I've seen all the seasons and I'm anxious for more.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Nice assortment of classic songs with Susan's special twist.  Fun having Michael Crawford and Donny Osmond included in the songs.
B008GJV8BW|5.0|An ensemble of great character actors portray the era in a way that makes all the violence fun!  Good plot with several sub plots keep you interested in between the bursts of Tommy Gun fire.  And there's nothing like a lot of &#34;Chicago Typewriters&#34; blasting away to keep you watching!  Of course the reality of those days was a sad one in this country, but the movie portrays the sub culture of the gangster era as a part of daily life for those that lived through it.  Albert Finney is terrific as is Gabriel Byrne.  For me a big plus is just seeing the style of the day.  The clothes, the city streets, and the cars, always the cars.
0470932139|2.0|The photographs in this book are very dark and moody. Not like the food photography I'm used to. Seems to me that there are a lot of mistakes (both grammatical and technical) in this book. She should have hired a proofreader.<br /><br />UPDATE:  After doing more food photography for local clients, I realized the importance of shooting in both landscape AND portrait format. Nearly every photo in the book is a vertical shot, making it much less useful for a client to use on a website or on social media.<br /><br />Why the author never shoots horizontally is a mystery.<br /><br />Finally, I think it's ridiculous that she doesn't tell the reader what shutter speed she uses! This is especially important to know for the action shots (pouring syrup, etc.).
B000SW2F80|5.0|I saw this years ago but it's still fun to watch.  Each mini movie, and there's four, starts with another of Stephen Kings unique, &#34;What if?&#34; ideas followed by a good presentation and follow through.  Of course Dan Akroyd is great.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I love this show, it was a lot of fun to watch. I especially liked the fact I could have the caption on. Thanks Amazon
B008XG1X18|5.0|What can you say about pinterest. It's great. I use it all the time.  I love the fact you can organize mouthpieces and find them when you need them. You can  see others ideas as well as your friends. I have insecticide my children's weddings to get some ideas. I think my favorite are the home remedies.
B00C5GZKVQ|4.0|Fun game with good graphics. Like others have said the controls are little difficult<br />to get used to. And forget about fighting mode, I can barely get the darn thing to aim properly.<br />I'd almost just like flying around than deal with the difficulty of aiming my guns.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love this game. It was free so I wasn't sure how it would be. It keeps you on your toes and makes you want to play more. The colors and graphics are great. I just love it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!! It an amazing game perfect for anyone great amazing like having your own horse but doesn't act up as much as a real one. I would recommend it to anyone of all ages
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Loved The Kite Runner; thought A Thousand Splendid Suns was even better. And the Mountains Echoed is another stunner.  Complex, poetic, at times literally breath-taking--Hosseini explores family, memory, betrayal, upheaval, and the power of time to heal and destroy. It is a beautiful, unforgettable work.
B009CWWFD2|4.0|About halfway through this &#34;novel&#34; I googled Rupert Murdoch and found that many of his life events were paralleled in &#34;The Fourth Estate.&#34;  I haven't exactly figured out who the other lead character is, because I didn't need to know to enjoy the book.  Having read Archer's Prison Diaries (all three volumes), I can see how Archer would relish taking on the Press, who badgered him unmercifully before and during his incarceration.
B000002KHH|5.0|Truly the complete package. Bill and Geezer were a solid foundation for the brilliant riffs of Tony Iommi and Ozzy's superb lyrics.<br />They were the best and I still play this cd. People believe they were devil worshippers etc. Listen to the lyrics. The songs are about warmongerers and evil politicians. Menacing sounds but not occult. Geezer and Ozzy, Tony and Bill had their finger on the pulse of the out of work and downtrodden. I love it.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|enough said. get it and enjoy. many influences and solid production.<br />like to run to it. why didn't i listen to them before.
B000929AJQ|5.0|Just an awesome album.  If you like any NIN you will like this album. What else can I say. One
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I watched it on tv when it first aired and it is just as good no. Definitely worth the time.
B000O178BY|3.0|It's not my favorite NIN album. I honestly don't listen to it a whole lot. But it has some good songs in it. If you're a NIN fan it's of course a must to own.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I really like it it's easy to use and tells you exactly how much battery power you really have and it was so nice
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The story started slowly for me, but often the best books do. That was true of Wool. Gradually, though, I found myself being pulled into the story, and I had to resist the urge to peak. Mr. Howey gives the reader a bleak view of life in the future that is all too believable.<br />I was especially drawn to the book's title. I finally think I've figured out why Wool is such a good title. I believing was taken from an old saying-To pull the wool over someone's eyes. See if you don't agree with me after reading this book.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Don't  have to wait forever for it to download on to my Kindle Fire very fun<br />No problems<br />Best games on the planet
B002T9H2LA|5.0|Bought this DVD for my husband for Fathers' Day.  We enjoyed it very much.  It's time to bring it out again and view it!!!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I thought this was going to be the last book in the series but there were so many unresolved issues in this book there has to be another one. I waited months for this book and now I have to wait months for the next one. I like the crossfire series I just don't l like the waiting. This book was good with the WTF moments but the first two books were better in my opinion.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|So incredible easy to use, bought with 1 click and was able to watch instantly! Would def recommend to anyone.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I loved every minute of the movie. The best of the best actors were in this knock em dead movie. I loved it every minute of the way!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Love the Facebook app. It's pretty easy to use and quicker then having to go online all the time just to see what's going on :)
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Love it . Makes me think and I surprise myself on how I figured thinks out . Very addicting . I look forward to the next clues and visual is amazing
B004SCN2F6|5.0|Challenging, flexible, fun, massive.  This game is the epitome of trading/combat RPG games.  The wide variety of choices let's you adapt to your playing style.  Excellent game.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Did not want it to end!  Something for everyone.  Whether you want it to or not, some part of this novel will tug at your heart strings.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Fun game with hours of challenge. I especially like the animation. It helps<br />that it is free as well. Good purchase
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Universal story of human suffering and love. Victor Hugo wrote so beautifully -so detailed and lyrical. One of my favorite books ever...
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Detailed and smooth graphics and fun game play, but sometimes character is hard to control. Not all controls are intuitive, and I am still not sure how to switch weapons.
B00133KFGW|5.0|My daughter turned me onto this movie. Refreshing and warm. Of course the street life was softened for the movie, but overall a good story.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|I made the mistake of trying this after the HD version, so the graphics are not as impresive, and I like the aiming feature of the space version
B002QYSZBO|3.0|Definitely different maybe even a bit artsy. I enjoyed it but, then I enjoyed the Jerk when it 1st came out.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|Good graphics and physics engine. I like the aiming feature and the puzzle quality of some of the levels. Also like the fact that there is more than one way to solve some.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Great watch, looks nice and tells the time. In my opinion, it is the best option for a good inexpensive automatic watch. some things to keep in mind before purchasing: The watch is non-hacking, so when you pull the crown out to set the time the second hand does not stop ticking, So you can't set the seconds, which isn't that big of a deal because it's a mechanical watch and you will always be +/- 3-15 seconds a day anyways. just set to within the minute and you will never be more than 30 seconds out of the actual time. there is a method of setting the second hand but its not totally reliable and some people say you risk breaking your watch. The Lume on the hands are good enough that I could see that it 4 in the morning when I originally fell asleep at midnight. The watch does not have a setting on the crown to wind the watch, may be an issue if you don't plan on wearing this watch everyday, this watch isn't very hard to wind since seiko uses their magic lever system, you can rotate the watch either direction to wind the watch. The date changes slowly between 10pm-1am, and the day changes between 12am-4am. It's not that big of a deal but as the day changes the wheel spends about two hours showing the day it's changing out of in spanish, something to consider if you work overnight.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|I didn't want to spend a fortune, but wanted my new Kindle Fire safe.  This case is secure enough to hold my kindle, lightweight, and a bright enough color to find quickly.  The auto wake and sleep feature is nice. The band holds it closed well, and gives me a spot for my stylus when not in use.  It's compact enough to fit in my purse!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Great place to go for ideas, websites for your interests, and awesome pictures. This is where to be for just about any subject that interests you.
0446604844|5.0|Another excellent David Baldacci read.................once the characters are introduced you're already into the action so have trouble putting it down. I haven't found a book of his that I don't like. My son(25)  is now reading it, David Baldacci appeals to all age groups.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|A different take on his usual great writing. I liked it a lot. Will see if I can get my grand kids to read it.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Saw this app and wanted to see how it worked; the visual battery is simple to inform and the other info is easy to understand.  Simple and nice.
B0054W4JQK|3.0|Bit repetitive and tedious to start with and then gets interesting. Then you are glad book's over. Clever plot but it could have been better written.
B008ROG1QI|4.0|I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in WWII.  It is a great human interest story from a fascinating era.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|ilike that I am finally able to see the temp on the battery,<br />even tho you have to actually have to open the app i wish they could include that on the widget
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is great!! i love it! i play it every day!!!!!<br />i like the way it gets hareer as you get faster!!!
B007HO392S|5.0|This cd is absolutely the best collection of Carrie Underwood. If you love Carrie Underwood get this<br />cd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  It's great!!!
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|A good game for what is there.  I think it has just enough game to captivate you, get you hooked and get you to buy more.
B0054SMID0|4.0|Lincoln Lawyer was definitely worth watching.I'd just finished listening to this story on CD and was pleasantly surprised at how closely the movie mirrored the CD. Matthew, Marisa, and Ryan are three of my fave actors and I thought they were excellent. Recommend this one highly.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great series, looking forward to more of this type of show. Love the series and will get future  episodes as they become available.
B0054SMID0|5.0|Excellent movie.  McConaughey gives a stellar performance.  Lots of twists that you don't expect.  Would watch it again and again.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I lovee this game it's just that we'll it will not update to the new 7.1 version and every one else has it and I'm tired of hearing about all the cool new lava and water bucket and you can put animals where ever you want
B007FRHZ4A|4.0|My son adores the space bubble, the game play, and the figures. The only drawback is that the blocks are hard to build with because the sides aren't perfectly straight -- they're roundish and unstable.
B0085YOD1A|4.0|Needed some other way to be sure I charged my kindle before I ran out. It&quot;s perfect let's me know before I run out
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|This game is addictive! I play it a lot, and I really enjoy the graphics and all the colors are amazing. Very fun game to play when you are bored, in the car, or just looking for something to do.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I love the game but despise the fact that your bonus coins and prizes are dropped to the sides to where no matter how you drop your coins they still fall off.
B00AEFY0F2|5.0|Tom Hanks as a lovable simpleton who tells us about his life and adventures with humor love and grace a must see classic film
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This is a fun game for all ages. My kids and I fight over who's turn it is to play.  My kids are learning about the ocean and fish life and they don't even realize it that's what makes even better
B00BSBT8M6|2.0|I was excited to see this movie, since the idea of being trapped on a life boat with a Bengal tiger is quite interesting to say the least. But the religious connotations were confusing and annoying (they seemed extremely &#34;philosophically dated&#34; to me personally since I had dealt with those questions long ago and left them in the dust), and in my opinion too away from the movie. Without giving the movie away, all I can say is that the ending was very disappointing! If the acting, dialogue and plot other than the main tiger scenes were developed even slightly, then I may have at least enjoyed the movie as a whole. Positives: the &#34;fantasy-impressionist-style&#34; cinematography at see was spectacular, and some of the tiger scenes almost made me hold my breath, but not enough to save the entire message of the movie, which is important for me. I'm 54, have seen hundreds of movies from classics to foreign to documentary, have been an avid reader since the age of 9, was an honors student through school, and majored in English. There is no way in my mind that this movie should have gotten the attention that it did.
B0082Z1CVQ|4.0|An innocent peep at the lives of young girls/women during the American Civil War.  Good reading for pre teen girls who have an incling to like hisrorical novels.
B00APJLX8E|5.0|Very funny and a great film for a family movie night. My girl loved it and had many laughs! i highly recommend this to all parents!
B005MLOKXA|4.0|It's not easy working mother at a high powered law firm, being the mother of two teenagers and the wife of a politician. This show combines great court scenes with the politics of a struggling law firm and the relationships they engender.
B0039OC64M|4.0|Great film! Even though it was made eons ago for someone my age, it holds up well. It's still very entertaining in this century!
B006M4F67A|5.0|Over 15 different puzzles to solve with increasing difficulty. A great way to stay sharp and kill as much time as you'd like. Well worth the price.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Another great film by Tarantino! One could never expect anything less from such an amazing filmmaker. Graphic and gruesome but extremely entertaining!
B00632HWOG|3.0|Is okay, Gmail is better.  It is too fussy sometimes.  I Have however see much worse as well.  About in the middle.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|A wonderful old fashioned family musical - wonderful songs and lyrics. Great for most kids 7-plus. The child catcher might be scary for younger kids but, like the Wicked Witch in the Wizard of Oz, he injects some creepy fun.  Highly recommend.
B008JJM88Q|4.0|Muy din&aacute;mico, divertido y entretenido, la forma como va descartando las respuestas que le das lo lleva a propinarte una sorpresa, es un buen juego para los ratos de ocio con la familia y amigos.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It`s good but not for kindle fire the updates don't come as fast as android I`m so mad. I am going crazy!
1845025032|5.0|This is a great book: the story is clever and the illustrations are adorable.  Unfortunately, I bought it as a gift for a four year old who found it frightening.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|Not too bad of a story line but make sure you watch it without any distractions or you might miss something. Surprising storyline that will keep you wondering...what?????
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|There comes a time when a person such as myself who has read lots and lots of material and even enjoyed successful manifestations by choice just had to step it up or move it along.  Right now life circumstances I probably inadvertently selected unconsciously have left me with proof that yes reality is playing out just as I expect whether its conscious or not. I get it. But even with that being said,  there was still this hesitancy to ask for what I really want. This book is a direct approach. Do it or don't: either way a person can clearly see where they stand in the process. If a person explores this they just might be surprised.  I found the experiments worked,  some I had done before. What was valuable to me, was that I now have a better handle on what 's working and why.  No, I do not consider the Divine my servant because I of myself can do nothing.  This subject is larger than that.  Our very lives are operating in this dynamic all the time anyway. It would seem more pleasing to make choice consciously.....Ask and you shall receive....
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|Don't waste your money on this stupid stupid movie. Bruce Willis must have been hard up or in a coma when he made this lame excuse for a movie. I wouldn't even rent it from Redbox and their movies only cost $1.25!!!!. Very FAKE and stupid story line. Better quit while you are still a credible actor..better be more choosy in what movies you make.
B004XUMMFE|4.0|Very imaginative  , humorous and pertinent sci-fi series. Worth it to take the time to give this a  leisurely view.
B009NNG202|1.0|Yuk is all I can say unless you like movies from the dark and dirty ages. I couldn't get past Dustin Hoffman and smelling scents to make a perfume..although he has the &#34;nose&#34; for it.
B000BYA4JM|5.0|This was a pleasant surprise as I'm always very nervous working with unknown vendors for purchases. The DVD was in good condition  after arriving quicker than what I thought it would.
B00BLGXL3U|4.0|This was a weird movie but very poignant and truthful when it comes to the part that Joaquin Phoenix played.Coming from a dysfunctional family where the mother was a nutcase and the father an alcoholic and he ended up with both traits. Being in the service did not help his drinking problem at all and he just did not know what he wanted to do after the war and was so unsure of himself as a man and a human being. Philip Hoffman did a good job as the (fake) healer/preacher??? and what a smooth talker he was to get all these stupid people to believe in him and follow his works. Just another cult religion just like many of our organized religions today. People are so gullible and needing and will believe in most anything if the time is right. Philip did end up helping Joaquin to a point but this was a weird a** show. Not suitable for those under 16.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have found more ideas for a bridal shower on here than if I went to the book store or just goggle bridal showers.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I watched the entire season in a marathon over Memorial Day weekend.  There is very little I watch on TV, but I will be watching Season 4 faithfully.
1439152802|5.0|This book kept me up reading late into the night and had a great surprising ending.<br />I've read other books by Kate Morton and this is is truly one of her best.
B0014Z4ON4|3.0|If this is a prequel, when and where did Indiana Jones dump poor Short Round?<br /><br />When this second installment started with an old Busby Berkeley style musical number, I thought I put the wrong DVD into the player.  Yipes.  This was quickly followed by a tense trade-off that soon turned into a slapstick routine between a diamond and a vial of antidote.  Balloons and bad guys, a car chase involving a rickshaw, and Indy now saddled with the most obnoxious whiner ever committed to celluloid: \\"I burnt by fingers and I cracked a nail!\\"  After that inauspicious beginning the film stalls and doesn't rev up again until they're in the Temple of Doom.  At that point, the movie redeems itself with plenty of action, including a chase sequence with mining cars and a whole lot of water.  It can't, however, make up for the constant griping and wailing of requisite damsel in distress, Kate Capshaw.  If caterwauling were an art form, this woman would take the prize.<br /><br />Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is not nearly as much fun as the first film, nor does it have the same sense of adventure (that was sorely needed and missed).  I don't know why they thought they needed a prequel that does nothing to truly introduce the character.<br />No matter what time period they slap unto this, it still feels like it's just the next adventure, no Nazis but plenty of Thuggees to hiss and boo.<br />Several great set pieces though, do not a good film make.  The trek to the temple took forever!<br /><br />I've kept this one only because it's part of the set and for the second half, which is great.  Love the music.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|This is such a great show - unpredictable with a great cast of characters. I've watched it from day one and hope it stays on for many more years.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I started by watching Serenity the movie and then found the firefly season. I liked it very much, to bad they only had one season!!!
B0041KBWM0|4.0|I've seen several versions of Emma produced in the last 20 years and this is one of my favorites.  It took me a little while to warm to Ms. Garai as Emma, but all the other actors seemed very fitted for their roles, especially Michael Gambon who makes Mr. Wodehouse a very sympathetic character.  Recommended.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|Numbs the mind and causes a steady flow of endorphins. The music isn't obnoxious to the point I that I get annoyed.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Playing this game is very relaxing. I love horses. This is easy to following and play. Just a great game all around.
B00979JTWK|5.0|I love the Downton Abbey series and buy all DVD releases.  Marvelous story line and superb casting.  Now my daughter is watching Season 1.  Can't wait for the next season release.
B007FXLWKW|4.0|The film is great for children, very well made, with an excellent and engaging story and very good animation quality
B006TF6WAM|4.0|I enjoyed this book from start to finish.<br />I felt every step he made and really enjoyed his discriptions of the journey
B004UNX1LS|5.0|This app is great. Always has new videos and info for all artists. I like that you can create a playlist with your favorite videos.
B009C7ZQM4|2.0|I think the task manager on my samsung does as much or at least the same and maybe more efficiently. Just another app to slow down my device and take up precious room on hard drive.
B00271HAK8|5.0|This is a great movie that my wife and I saw when we were teenagers, and we watched it with our teenagers now, and it stands the test of time.  Great comedy, that speaks lightly to challenges kids have at school and being kids in general.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great ! Everything is there! For the people who don't have the the update, just wait , it will come later
B00005NNMJ|5.0|Balls to the Wall is still fresh today. The riffs are well written and rocking. The lyrics are in your face, no beating around the bush. Any young fan of music needs to experience Accept, they will hear another world of music.
B0009YKWAK|5.0|Glad I finally ordered this. Great action and acting. Kept my attention throughout the entire movie. Nicole Kidman is always great.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Worked great with my PC and enabled me to download various items straight onto the Kindle.  It did the job.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this app it's so fun and fruity I could play this game all day or forever and ever
B001TODCII|5.0|like both 1 and 2 Taken movies, so I needed to add them to my library,also a fan of Liam's movies.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Buy this game. It's so fun. Definitely better than computer. Buy it now. This is one of my new favorite games.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I think this is one of the best books in the series. At first I thought all this greek mythology stuff was stupid but now I can't wait for house of Hades to come out
B008PZ69T8|5.0|This is a very amazing cd that follows the Fifty Shades of Grey book well! I have a love for classical music and this is now one of my favorite cd! This is a wonderful collection of beautifully made classicals! I highly recommend this to others who enjoyed the trilogy books! This is very relaxing and yet very helpful for the mind to concentrate on life's events! Even if one has not been exposed to classical music before, this cd will help others to apprec!!ate this type of music
B0097K21YW|3.0|many levels here are highly creative but the execution is poor.  shots do not always behave as you would expect. some levels are highly frustrating and arbitrary.  scoring is difficult to understand.  it is easy to waste time with this game, but it is not in the same league with Angry Birds.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|greatest show ever made, Re watch over and over great cast great action Shane Vandrell is the man. Glad it is on Prime
B007MNV5WU|5.0|very creative use of gravity to make shots curve.  more challenging and more rewarding than other versions.  good variety of easy and difficult levels
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think you should play it it looks stupid but its really fun!!!!!!!!!! I love it I'm almost have another horse
B00BB22GQM|5.0|I am really enjoying this CD, it has the same wonderful beat and great lyrics that the other two offered.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|My whole family loves The Piano Guys!  We love the the ballads, the mash ups of classical and popular music, and the original work they produce.  The addition of the beautiful videos was an added bonus!
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|All I know if I was 55, I'd be dead after what Willis went through. But, this a movie and anything is possible!<br />Enjoyed the whole movie from start to finish, and since I just finished calibrating my TV with a setting change that brought out the best yet from my TV, it also did the same for this Movie. If it didn't look that good to you, it's sounds like your set needs tweaking! Have no problems referring people to watch this film!<br />I agree with one of the other reviewers. I was expecting something back at home after. But there wasn't, so, just imagine one!
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|The number of vehicles destroyed must set a record of some kind, even bigger than the body count.  And that's what you get in this rather tired franchise movie.  The chemistry between the 2 male leads has less fizz than day-old ginger ale, and the dialogue has the punch of retirement home conversation.  But there are lots of bad guys meeting their ends in the usual ways, and Bruce surviving traumas that would gel the bones of lesser mortals. It's okay brain candy for a Saturday afternoon.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Loved the original the little guy is just undeniable, now that there's two on noms in every level it makes me want to get them their candy faster, plus the comics? dying of the adorableness
B009KS4XRO|3.0|if you have any problems collecting coins or the game freezing up DONT waste you time contacting &quot;big brother buffalo&quot; because they wont do a thing about it.  they send you a form email about how they are aware of the problem and they are correcting it as fast as possible.  when I got the same email 3 weeks in a row. I kind of had a feeling my money was gone for good
B00910Y1OQ|2.0|I  purchased the Premium Atlantis because I was getting bored with regular Atlantis  It is the same  Premium said 54 levels  not so  You cannot get passed Greece level 7  all of the pieces of the item you are supposed to get are not on the game board  only 1 piece is  therefore you never get off level seven  it sends you back about three or four times after each time it tells you  that you have run out of time  after a while it gets boring and you don't play  if all the pieces on level seven are not on the board you cannot move to next level  the premium game is the same  sorry I wasted my time getting it.Valerie Genovese
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Really pleased with this bag I've been usiong it extensively for more than 3 mos. , and I can't find anything wrong to say about it.Practical ,well-made ,sturdy. In brief ,it carries the emblem *amazon* very well .
B008JJM88Q|5.0|Esta app es demasiado rajada. No paramos de hacerle preguntas y siempre nos encuentra quién es.<br />El clip de word.<br />Wilson de náufrago.<br />Morita de la era de hielo.<br />El chunche de la liga.<br /><br />Recomendado 100%
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Beautifully written story that is both hilarious and touching.  However, the diction used by the characters, in addition to the manner in which I believe it to be delivered, create a distance between the reader and the characters.  No teenager would use &#34;higher-education&#34; level diction in everyday conversation amongst peers.  Perhaps I'm biased because I'm familiar with the author's vlog series, but it seemed more plausible that these conversations were held between John and Hank Green rather than Hazel and Gus.  Other than this issue, the book is fantastic, and should still be read for its entertainment value.
B00AQMQBKK|5.0|I played both the board game and now the app. This is loads of fun as a single player game. The visuals are wonderful and the game play smooth on my Kindle Fire HD. If you you're a fan of Lovecraft or Fantasy Flight games then you'll love this app.
0765350386|5.0|Loved this novel, and immediately after reading I had to purchase the rest of the series.  It was interesting and unpredictable, a real page turner!  The characters were compelling and strong yet not without their own flaws which made this fantasy realm entirely realistic and engrossing.  I highly recommend to any fantasy reader, this series is worth your time!
1582406723|5.0|Came not long after I'd ordered. I love the series on tv and wanted to started collecting the graphics. Its in top condition even the corners are crisp.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this app is the best app on the kindle fire and it is fun and you get to be cratev and have fun!!!!!!!!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I too, was disappointed in the third book.  I thought of several plots and endings that would have been better (and I am not a writer and would never presume to be creative).  You took away the strength of Gideon and made him into a needy creature that had to get married to keep a girl??!!  Eva was boring.  Her mom and Victor having an affair was unnecessary.  Russian mob??!!  Are you kidding me?  Brett was just an annoying rock star and I could not believe that Eva would ever want to be around him.  Cary fathering a child was the only believable story line.  With the amount of sex he was having with Tatiana, it was bound to happen.  Unfortunately, we will never learn what happened between him and Trey.  Also, Eva's boss Mark turned into a wimpy sap.  Deanna-annoying and unnecessary.  Corrine and Giroux were important characters to keep in the book, but appear to be a throw away at the end.  Did an editor actually read this before it went out??
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This app is great! It tells me everything i would want to know about my battery. I got this when it was free and it is a very good deal even for the 99 cents. This is a must have application!
B008Y768XO|3.0|This was a very nice movie. Nothing really exciting about it nothing bad about it. Sweet tale of a Doug's love for his owner.
0425263924|5.0|I just got the book so can't say anything about it.  I can tell you that I read the first two books and liked them immensely.  I'm sure this one will be just as good.  I will have to go back and read book two as it has been so long since I read the first two and now just getting this third one.
0470450266|2.0|Buy at your own risk. The included DVD support doesn't work.  The disc cannot be read for some reason.  Other than that, the book is great.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Didn't seem like a true end of a wonderful series. I was greatly disappointed in this last entry in the Sookie novels, would have liked to seen closure, not left open for another book.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Read the book in. Two days. Couldn't get enough! Can't wait for the next book. Can it be released tomorrow!
B0085MK2GM|4.0|For those new to classical music, the late Canadian pianist Glenn Gould reconstituted J.S. Bach's art in the middle 20th century and turned its world upside down when he released the [[ASIN:B00006FI7C 1955 Goldberg variations]]. He did so by playing the music staccato without using any pedal then carried it forward in all Bach's keyboard works. While everyone in the period performance era now plays this way, it was new in 1955 and had never before been heard. The technique works better some places than others and works well in Bach because of the composer's mathematical perfrection in thes preludes and fugues where left-hand and right-hand voicing is so absolutely critical. Listen to the most approachable Prelude and Fugue in E flat No. 7 in the first book, tracks 13 and 14, to hear everything you need to know about this and about Gould -- including his famous humalong technique that has sent fans and critics on both sides of the Atlantic and a few other oceans atwitter for more than half a century now.<br /><br />Gould was one of the most interesting characters of the middle 20th century and was exploited by the recording industry more than just about any other virtuoso in the 1960s before he stopped recording and playing in public. He played a piano at his cottage on a lake near Toronto that sounded like a harpsichord and was the first major figure in classical music to try to make a modern piano sound like a harpsichord with no reverberant characteristics. This aided the clarity of his sound but also made it into a hybrid of modern pianism without beauty. To suggest Bach wanted his music played t this way is questionable although Bach never considered the 48 suitable to be played the way they are now -- with whole sets performed in concert and often recorded. Bach wrote them to promote his idea of equal temperament (the use of key structure we now follow unquestionably) and then his students and others played them for practice and to memorize equal temperament.<br /><br />Gould, being the ultiimate cult figure in his time and ours, is enough for Sony to continue rereleasing these works to new audiences. The sound hasn't been improved here so don't bother if you have one of the older sets. Gould wil always be unique for his approach. As to ideas one reviewere wrote that his \\"digital technique in its relationship to the keyboard was of astonishing,\\" this is now commonplace among recent graduates of musical conservatories. Gould is no longer unique in this respect with the thousands of new pianists copying him every day with even more perfect forms of prestidigitization at the keyboard. But, as anyone that always hated Gould's apprach inately knows, there is more than one way to play the piano; just ask (or listen to) [[ASIN:B008NR8YXC Andras Schiff's]] well-tempered klavier -- or any other pianist that believes in using the sostenuto pedal with some romantic character.r /><br />Gould, being the ultiimate cult figure in his time and ours, is enough for Sony to continue rereleasing these works to new audiences.

But, as anyone that always hated Gould's apprach inately knows, there is more than one way to play the piano; just ask (or listen to) [[ASIN:B008NR8YXC Andras Schiff's]] well-tempered klavier -- or any other pianist that believes in using the sostenuto pedal with some romantic character.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|The first two seasons of TWD was a story arc unto itself, showing the disintegration of ordinary human values as we know them. This was represented in the fall of Shane and the death of Daryl.<br /><br />In the 3rd season, we begin to see more clearly the post-apocalypse/wild west hybrid future that is the grim reality awaiting our survivors. Rick, the natural leader of the group and acting symbol of the old world's ideas of justice and order, has lost his way. Nothing is clear any more; Murderers may be strong allies and friends are potential weaknesses.<br /><br />The show's moral ambiguity has moved front & center, providing terrifying glimpses of how much harsher the path ahead will be. Civilization lost is not as easily regained as some seemed to have thought, and now they are beginning to realize the barbaric vision of what lies ahead for those who must fight and kill just to live each day.<br /><br />I anxiously await season 4. TWD is about zombies as much as Jericho was about nukes. It's about staying human in an inhuman world.

B004XMMSZG|4.0|This works with my Bose Sounddock and Ion Block Rocker. It doesn't work with my Sony dmport attached to my Sony receiver.<br /><br />I haven't tried to see how far it will go, but within the same room I don't have any issues.<br /><br />The reason I got this was too make it easier for everyone to use their iDevice with my various dockable sound systems.  It goes without saying that without some intervention you can't connect an iPad to a docking station. When we have people over, there are always times when someone wants to play their music.  Bluetooth makes it easy for others to connect,  plus we take the block rocker on weekend boating trips and it is not always easy to get to it to select songs.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|My friend told me this book was the greatest and let me borrow her copy.  I could not force myself to read past the first few chapters. I went to Amazon reviews to see what the hoopla was about and found many similar reviews to my own.  This book was so poorly written. I have to say that I enjoyed reading some of the reviews more than this book!
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|Loved the whole trilogy! It genuinely reflects the nuances of a mature and authentic relationship. See all three - the sequence doesn't matter.
B0054VVRBQ|5.0|I purchased The Transcend TS-RDF1 from an outside seller but through Amazon.(at the time of this writing Amazon does not carry This expansion slot accessory)<br /><br />The Transcend TS-RDF1 fits perfectly flush, and works flawlessly in my Dell 1640 laptop.<br /><br />IMHO, The Transcend TS-RDF1 is a much better choice than the SanDisk unit which leaves<br />the memory card sticking out half an inch or so making it easy to damage the partialy exposed card.<br /><br />Larry
B004N6369Y|5.0|I love every book DS has written. She is one of my favorite authors and will always read all of her books.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Loved the book. I can remember sitting waiting for a doctor's appointment and laughing out loud while reading this on my Kindle Fire in the waiting room. Great read! Well written, believeable plot and folks can really bond with this main character. I'm sure I'll wait about a year and read this one again!
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|One of the best shows on tv. David Slade's visual style creates a dark, elegant, yet disturbing atmosphere that is perfect for this world. The actors are all outstanding and the writing is top notch.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Kept me interested to the end. I recommend to anyone that enjoys Action mixed with adventure. Will read again and again
B001UTW7QU|5.0|For some reason I quit watching the series when it was on TV. With amazon prime I can watch any time I want. Perfect.
B002Q7JYPC|1.0|I have given this album many listens since it was released.  I rushed down to WalMart the day it came out with great anticipation.  Its not horrible like some say but its not even close to great either.  It's so over polished production wise that it feels more like a perfect mannequin than a something real.  Kind of like the soulless feel of a drum machine.  Joe Walsh's songs are just plain dumb.  He used to be funny, now he's useless.  Timothy's songs are ok.  And let's face it, it was never Timothy's songs that sold the album's anyway.  So for his soft spot here and there he does ok.  Reverend Sunshine Henley mounts the pulpit and like so many sermons, he preaches way too long and leaves the audience snoozing.  Glenn, buddy you can't compete with actual country artists so just stop.  Biggest mistake they made was firing Don Felder.  Almost equally was the loss of Leadon.  I have tried hard several times to make myself like this album.  But the more I listen, and the more I know these songs, the more I'm convinced its 3rd rate.  The lyrics don't stand up to the old days.  The production is too error correcting and perfect.  So Glenn and Don got what they finally wanted: absolute and complete control with no one to question them.  And the results are crap.  They need some fire, they need some resistance, and quite frankly they needed some inspriation.  They can only hate George Bush and America so much before it wears thin.  I wish I'd never heard this clean cut drivel.  It's just a black-eye on their legacy.  A perfect, Hollywood, nothing-out-of-place black-eye.  There's something to be said for quitting while you're on top.
1416575464|5.0|Lots of inspiring pictures, advice & tips. This book takes you room by room with notes and pictures. It's a great, pretty & easy manual!
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|This story was a top-knotch example of a man loving a woman enough to make sacrifices for her best interest. The woman did the same. Wow! Not enough of these movies out there! It was another example of the writer's terrific style!
1401941893|5.0|Coming from a model, you expect this to be shallow and corny. I was hesitant in getting this when my teen asked for it. I was surprised to read how inspiring and encouraging this book is. She enjoys it a lot, going back to certain pages to read over. It helps with self-esteem and has a very positive mood.
B00BC24NT4|5.0|Excellent<br />A Cultural Icon, what seems to be a relevant and meaningful representation of current espionage.  Everyone should read and enjoy.

B009KY5OGC|5.0|There was much ado when Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee was initially published.  Its critical acclaim along with its brisk sales were also accompanied with critics from academia claiming that Dee Brown was plagiarizing from other people's research without the proper credits or footnotes.  Being a rather skeptical history student myself I've avoided reading this work.  So after forty three years my curiosity finally gave in and I finally took in Dee Brown's story.<br /> Brown actually starts from the beginning when the Europeans first came to North America and follows the story of the American Indians to its sad conclusions in the late 19th century.  The stories told herein are a sad repeating of the white man's treachery and broken treaties based on lies with no honor whatsoever.  From the Eastern settlements, all the way to the West Coast we see the Native Americans being forced ever westward until they ran out of space.<br /> Americans considered the Native American Indians as sub-humans.  They were considered persona non grata.  From the tribes of the Navaho, the Sioux, the Cheyenne and Arapaho onto the Apaches, the Modoc onto the Utes and Ponca the Americans dealt with all these tribes in the same shameful way.<br /> How the United States dealt with the Indians is truly a sad chapter in American history.  In fact it wasn't until past the mid-20th century when upon self-reflection our country realized the error of our ways.  Hence the writing of such a book as this work has brought forth the real true history of these times.<br /> It was only eighty years ago when Hitler first came to power and started his twelve year Reich which was ensconced in an organized effort to rid Europe of all Jews whom he considered to be sub-human.  Does this sound familiar?  And to think that after WWII, we Americans were so revolted about the actions of the Nazis.  When our country in fact perpetrated a similar action against the Native American Indians and very nearly made them extinct.<br /> In John Toland's book on Adolph Hitler it was duly noted by Toland: \\"Hitler's concept of concentration camps as well as the practicality of genocide owed much, so he claimed, to his studies of English and United States History.<br /> He admired the camps for Boer prisoners in South Africa and for the Indians in the Wild West; and often praised to his inner circle the efficiency of America's extermination-by starvation and uneven combat-of the red savages who could not be tamed by captivity.\\"<br /> One thing is certain of Brown's book is that the American Indian did not go quietly to their demise.  They fought with bravery and at times combat-ready savagery.  They were fighting for their way of life and their land!  In doing so, they really wanted to be left alone and in peace.  This was not to be, and the United States was playing out \\"Manifest Destiny.\\"<br /> So these stories of treachery and shame from our young government are told in a frank and honest book.  I am glad I read it and it deserves every one of the five stars.nct.<br /> In John Toland's book on Adolph Hitler it was duly noted by Toland: \\"Hitler's concept of concentration camps as well as the practicality of genocide owed much, so he claimed, to his studies of English and United States History.<br /> He admired the camps for Boer prisoners in South Africa and for the Indians in the Wild West; and often praised to his inner circle the efficiency of America's extermination-by starvation and uneven combat-of the red savages who could not be tamed by captivity.\\"<br /> One thing is certain of Brown's book is that the American Indian did not go quietly to their demise.

B0091REZMW|3.0|Game shuts down after exploring the Garden and it would be nice if you could earn diamonds faster.  Otherwise, it's a fun game.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|It is way more convenient than going to device and then seeing battery usage that way. It's worth it, saves you a couple of seconds, but that will all add up.
B004CURZFC|5.0|great for kids & enjoyable for adults, too. true heroes & villains, & lessons on friendship & loyalty, as well as on inclusion and accepting others; but not preachy or pushy. great visuals, colors fill the screen, delighting the eyes & the mind.doesn't talk down to kids, but treats them as independent thinkers. a most enjoyable experience!!
B008I6ZX1E|1.0|I purchased this box set at the price it was because 1. I would have loved to have the full collection (so far) The books look nothing like they do on the described picture. Am I missing something?? Everywhere I look for these books they look like the pic on this listing and nowhere can I find books that look like the ones I received. If I purchased em cus of the way they looked that's what I expect to recieve  and 2 the books are not new, why would I pay almost $140 for a set of books that looked used. Very unsatisfied and hoping to return them for a refund
B006VFLIYK|3.0|I always enjoy his books some are better than others.  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a fast read and doesn't have to try and figure out anything.

B000U6BT40|1.0|Unfortunately, right from the get go the writers ruined an otherwise perfectly decent show by inserting crude and smutty content.  Don't waste the light within you by watching it.
B00821OX98|5.0|I can hardly make myself go to bed at a decent time because I always want to watch the next episode. Engaging story, good acting and good special effects. Lots of unexpected twists and turns. Not nearly as predictable as I thought it would be. Watch it. You'll like it.
B00BI5IXL4|4.0|If only they would have toned down the smut and carnality.  I think the producers/directors must have felt like everyone would be thrilled with more overt slutiness and brazen sexuality.  I was more disappointed.
B0084AXZK0|3.0|The book makes you think about certain things, but it's not my type. I guess it was a bit slow.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|If you don't get this game you will be missing out for the rest of your life!!!! This game totally Awesome!!!!
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|I believe most people that grew up watching the original movies will find themselves a little disappointed by this latest addition to the Die Hard franchise. Its not a bad movie, but it didn't feel the same anymore. Some people might say its because of Bruce Willis age, but he did pretty well and I don't feel like that hurt the movie. I would agree with a couple of other reviewers that said the acting was off a bit. All the Die Hard's have a little bit of comedy and one liners from Bruce Willis, but it just didn't work in this one. I was seriously sick of hearing him say he was on vacation. I also don't feel like Bruce sharing equal screen time with his \\"son\\" really worked. Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson in Die Hard 3 worked. This was just a pale shadow of what we saw there. Whats missing most to me though is the bad guy. The first three movies had memorable characters that you really wanted to see dead, while this movies bad guys were very bland and I didn't really care what happened to them.<br /><br />A Good Day to Die Hard has some great action sequences. Its also great to see Bruce Willis playing this character again. The movie is enjoyable to rent if you are looking for some fun, but there does seem to be a few holes in the acting, the jokes fall a bit flat, the story involving his son really leaves something to be desired, and the bad guys just really make you feel indifferent when you should want to see Bruce take them out by the end of the movie.
B00785P2QC|5.0|It not like a game I played before. It earn you money when you're asleep. this game is really fun and I hope you download it. P.s.it's awesome download it now

B004DNWPY4|5.0|Talk about a paradigm shift in how I will now view the wealthy. And to think I've spent life at present trying to make more money so I would have more when all along it is the utilization of the resources at hand that matters most.

B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This is a beautifully written story, at times funny, at times heartbreakingly sad.  The characters are complex, and the story has a way of grabbing hold of your heart and not letting go.  A must read!

B004X6PRO6|4.0|I wasn't sure how I was going to like this book when I first began reading it.  But once I got past the first couple of chapters, I couldn't put it down!
B00CFA227C|5.0|It's rare to find an adventure film for kids that is actually appropriate for kids to watch.  Note: there is the word b*stard, and there is some cleavage.  The opening scenes also need to be explained to children - bad things happening when we try to build our own Tower of Babel, that sort of thing. Other than that, it's a fun, clean movie that I won't hesitate to allow my sons to watch.  Refreshing to have such a movie produced in this day and age.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|A great movie beautiful story and good acting. I could watch this everyday and I may need to buy my own copy
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Boy, I wish the movie would have at least shown THIS character rather than the Hollywood version - he was much more interesting and much sicker than what we got in the movie. The relationship between him and his father was a lot more complex as well. There was a lot of co-dependency going on between the mom, the son, and the father and the interactions where very interesting. The whole interaction with the dancer is more complex and twisted as well. (I did read the book before the movie, as I usually do.) The book is much, much different from the movie and the two should not be seen as the same story - they are different stories!<br /><br />The book shows us what it is like to live in the head of a delusional schizophrenic/manic person. The son keeps a journal and makes lists of the things he does and what he is planning to do to get back his wife. He never acknowledges that they are divorced and won't even accept that there was a major incident that caused their break-up (until the end). The writing is good and, although there's a lot of repetition in actions, you keep turning the pages. You want to find out what happened between him and his wife. You want to find out if he will ever accept what happened. Will he get back with his wife? Will he ever have a &#34;normal&#34; relationship with his father? And, the dance competition is NOTHING like the movie and is extremely moving.<br /><br />Read this book and forget about the movie!
B00633W614|2.0|In the past,, I've really liked Jeffrey Archer's books.I was very disappointed. in this particular novel.  I was planning on reading the Chronicles, but think I'll pass on them.
B0085YOD1A|4.0|It gives you more information than the built in battery indicator for when you need to know the status with a little more precision.

1611761115|4.0|Daniel Pink has again moved me to reconsider how I go about teaching middle school students.  Forget the old wisdom that children &#34;should&#34; be enthusiastic about learning -- it doesn't work in the current day.  Instead, I'm thinking about how to convince students that the &#34;product&#34; I'm offering is worth their time and attention.  How does this knowledge relate to their lives, and how will it affect their futures?  Looking at the curriculum in this way definitely makes my job easier and more effective.

0399165274|3.0|\\"The Kill List\\" sees Frederick Forsyth return to the formula that kicked off his career when \\"Day of the Jackal\\" was published about 40 years ago.  Both \\"Kill List\\"and \\"Jackal\\" focus on a manhunt across the world for a lethal killer.  In Jackal the killer was an assassin for hire; in \\"Kill List\\" the target is an \\"Islamic Extremist Internet Preacher\\" known as \\"The Preacher.\\"  Both books follow the manhunt as it's conducted by one-man, who in the new book is an Ex-Marine with the personality of a bar of Ivory Soap, and is on loan to an extra-clandestine CIA group.<br /><br />\\"Kill List' is nowhere near as good as \\"Jackal,\\" but it is a solid book.  The story moves precisely along, with very few action sequences, but lots of behind the scenes manipulations.  Sometimes it reads like a chess match and because of this the book isn't very exciting.  As a matter of fact, it's kind of dull.  I tolerated the dullness because the book was only 330 pages long, but if it went on  much longer I would've skimmed.  None of the characters has much, if any, personality.  The ending is kind of a letdown as well...<br /><br />It's a good thriller for someone with a heart condition that shouldn't be exacerbated.
B0093QE37S|5.0|We've seen and enjoyed the later Bing Crosby/Frank Sinatro/Grace Kelly/Satchmo/etc version several times over the years. Got to the point where I can sing along with the True Love song.<br />This older, black and white version, however, just blew us away - it does not have the great songs, the singers and music of the later version but the characters are much more believable and filled out. There are some interesting twists with the story that we don't get in the later version. And the acting is absolutely superb! It is an interesting lesson in acting to compare the two versions. Very enjoyable and highly recommended.
0307887448|5.0|Oh, if only there was a world where knowledge of early 80s video games, movies, TV, and D&D games made you a superstar!  Its a great sci-fi story too. If you were an 80s teenager you will love this book.
159463176X|4.0|And the Mountains Echoed covers nearly 60 years and several generations.  The novel opens with an Afghan father selling his two-year-old daughter to a wealthy couple, thus separating her from her nine-year-old brother.  It is emotional and painful.  What happens to the brother and sister, as well as their parents, children, relatives and caretakers, over the next six decades takes the reader through multiple locations and time periods.<br /><br />While Khaled Hosseini is a gifted storyteller and talented writer, his third novel seems to be weighed down by too many characters and too many locations.  I had to write down the characters and their relationship in order to keep them straight.  Hosseini often flips around in time when telling the story, making it more difficult to comprehend.  Sometimes, it's difficult to tell which character is talking or what year it is.<br /><br />I agree with reviewers who felt the book lagged in the last 100 or so pages.  There are some very interesting parts and characters, but there are also some uninteresting parts and characters.  The ending was not as emotional or revealing as I expected.  While this is a worthwhile read, it touches reach the level of The Kite Runner.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|The backgrounds and scenes of this game are very detailed. It is more difficult but better than just running on straight courses like in the first Temple Run. It uses your brain more and adds suspense! It is a perfect game to play, and even better because it's free!
