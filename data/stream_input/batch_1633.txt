B008M34INW|5.0|This is a pinnacle for Tough Guy Movies. Mel Gibson is at his best in \\"Get the Gringo\\", I highly recommend to buy or rent this movie. It is gritty and  a true look at the corruption in Mexico, and especially the brutality of the prison systems in general in corrupt countries. This is an AMAZON must have or at least see! It is one of my favorites! See my site on [...]  Shop:fineartbyjacomet

B00973DDN2|3.0|There seem to be two camps when it comes to The Killers. The Hot Fuss fans and the Sam's Town brigade. The Hot Fuss fans want The Killers to ditch any hint of 70's American heartland rock and try to be The Psychedelic Furs of the 21st century. The Sam's Town brigade tends to like The Killers when they rock out and emulate Springsteen. I was NOT a fan of Sam's Town. It had a few great singles but a lot of filler. I think Battle Born is more of a Sam's Town type of record (Springsteen pastiches and all) but it's not as derivative as the aforementioned album. In fact, I like it better....although I guess that's not saying much. Battle Born has one major thing going for it though and it's Brandon Flowers' voice. If you were looking for a reason to buy this album, that would be it. He sings like a man reborn here. Better yet, he sounds like he's grown into the arena rock band frontman that he's always \\"tried\\" to sound like.<br />The album starts off strong with \\"Flesh And Bone\\" (classic Killers), \\"Runaways\\" (the single, but not one of their strongest), the excellent \\"The Way It Was\\" and \\"Here With Me\\" (a power ballad in 2012? Yep..and a pretty good one too). Sadly, the album takes a nosedive right after that with a string of forgettable songs made even worse by some truly horrible lyrics. Finally, the album perks up a bit with \\"From Here On Out\\" which sounds like the Traveling Wilburys song that never was(!!!??). After that...<br /><br />..I'll just say it. \\"Be Still\\" is a monster..dare I say a classic. I've never cared for any of The Killers' ballads but this one ought to be song of the year! Moving and powerful.<br /><br />So we're really talking about 6 good song here aren't we? Well..no, we're not because, true to form, The Killers have relegated some of their best material to the bonus tracks section: \\"Carry Me Home\\", \\"Prizefighter\\" and the Jaques Lu Cont remix of \\"Flesh And Bone\\" could've forgiven a multitude of sins if The Killers had swapped out some of the dirges that drag this record down midway through and replaced them with these songs. What's with these guys? Can't they recognize a good song when they record it?<br /><br />I'm always in The Killers' corner because this is a band that's reaching for the brass ring while most other stadium rock bands these days just noodle around and hope for the best. To some, the group's lust for glory is what drove them away, but hey....it's refreshing to hear a band with any ambition outside of getting a good review on Pitchfork in 2012. The Killers always try...and when they stumble, part of me is grateful that they care enough to fail every now and then.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Great graphics but too easy for children to hit the buttons and accidentally buy things.<br />Addictive for my grandson who loved the movies. Hard to exit when you are finished.

B007SGM084|4.0|I got this because it was the most talked about book in ages.<br />While the writting style is light, the content is quite contraversial. It takes a \\"unspoken \\"topic and weaves a story around it.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|this game is so much fun.But. the coins go fast and you have to buy more expensive to purchase..when you use them they are gone its not like you can win them back.to bad its so much fun... needs to be a. better way to earn coins back..do not get if you are not willing to buy the coins....
B008XG1X18|3.0|They recently updated this app and now it freezes frequently on loading.  Never had problems with old version.  When the app loads it works fine, and its much easier to use on the Kindle than trying to use the browser with Pinterest.  It also has trouble going back to the app after clicking on a link.

055350259X|5.0|I bought this in anticipation of a ten-hour road trip. I'd read A Walk in the Woods and loved it. This author is fascinated by history whereas I am not particularly, so I found the bits about Australian history to be long-winded at times. That said, the book is really absorbing and very funny. Bryson is an excellent writer and has a brilliant knack for observing human behavior. Plus, his voice is mesmerizing: kind of like John Malkovich's without that sinister edge. Highly recommend!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This trilogy is absolutely amazing.  I read all three books in 10 days.  As long as you can get pass the sex for those that have a problem with that it does have a great story line and I can't wait for the next series and the movie!

B004YD1KTO|5.0|I have read Rosamund Luptons first book Sister and really enjoyed it.  I was so happy to find she had written another book, Afterwards.  Could'nt wait to read it and was not dissappointed.  Her writing in unique and captivating, her subject is sad but so well written that you still love the book and can't wait to know how it ends.
B0029QRA1U|4.0|bought this for $110 at Newbury Comics, i should of bought it online but im not patient at all. it works fine, but there are better ones out there, i should of looked on amazon more. im still very happy tho, its a good, easy to use product.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I cant stop playing this game. I love it. The only bad thing I can say about it is that it takes too long to refill your coins. But even that small annoyance isn't enough to keep me from playing it all the time.
B008QZ1ZYQ|5.0|I love this game! It is fun, and a challenge with out being to hard or complicated! The music is catchy and it's easy to get hooked on completing a level! I like it better than Angry Birds!
B005LAIHSQ|2.0|If it wasn't for the stunning performance of Charlize Theron then this movie would have been a 1 star. Kristen Stewart is so terrible and so oddly disconnected that she appears partially tranquilized.  Thank goodness they didn't give her more lines!  And the scenes where she is supposed to come across powerfully to evoke the kind of connection to Snow White you want to have.  No chance!<br /><br />Charlize Theron and the huntsman carry this movie to its final conclusion.  Which is ruined by a queen apparently struck deaf and mute standing around after being crowned. Can't wait for a remake with Kristen replaced with a decent actress who can look at the camera with meaningful expressions and evoke emotions from the audience.
0439023513|1.0|First of all, I am a 24 year old guy that loves a good book. I actually had no intentions of reading \\"The Hunger Games\\", but the movie came out to redbox with nothing else to watch. I decided what the heck, if all else fails I am only out a couple of bucks - but WOW, it was WAY better than I thought it was going to be. After watching the movie, I asked my sister about the differences between the book, and then started on number two, \\"Catching Fire\\".<br /><br />\\"Catching Fire\\" started of really boring, dragged for almost the entire first half of the book, and then finally picked up its pace. \\"Mockingjay\\", did no such thing. What happened? This book was so poorly written, there were no strong plot elements, and I hated every character. Like another reviewer pointed out, the whole book was driven by \\"and then this happened, and then this happened...\\" I understand that this book was YA and I usually like books with more depth, but this was just pathetic. I actually found myself skipping complete pages and not missing a thing.<br /><br />The characters? I don't even know where to start with that one. It seemed every single character was someone else - more depressing than a funeral. I was even starting to hope that they would all just be killed off.<br /><br />Not to make this review any longer (I hate long reviews), but I heard a lot of people talking about the ending. They claimed that we only disliked it because of the lack of a happy ending... bull! It was beyond pointless, abrupt, and at the same time dragged out. Lets kill everyone off, which is fine, but then skip all emotion and reason, skip ahead 3-4 weeks - still depressed, skip ahead another 3-4 weeks - depressed but going home. Oh, almost forgot, lets also forget about every other character and just have Katniss \\"settle\\" with Peeta (showing no emotion from anyone) for some strange, half fast, made up on the spot ending because I can't think of what else to jump to for the next 3-4 weeks. Then, finish off by jumping AGAIN and still showing nothing of importance.<br /><br />I am not against so called \\"sad\\" endings, but this was just a \\"bad\\" ending to a terrible book.<br /><br />If you liked the first two, SKIP THIS ONE!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I wanted a basic function calculator for my kindle fire and this is a great program exceeds my expectations. Easy to use,  simple and no distractions.
159413586X|4.0|Mockingjay has a completely different tone than the first two books in this series.  After reading Catching Fire, which was good, but really felt so similar to The Hunger Games, I wasn't sure if I wanted to keep going.  Don't get me wrong, the first two books were great and worth reading, but I felt that they were so alike in plot that when it came to the third I just wasn't sure if I could take `more of the same'.  I am glad to say that Mockingjay was very different from the first two.<br /><br />For me, the best part about Mockingjay was that we get to see a different side of Katniss.  She has been forced to grow up, as she takes on the role of being \\"The Mockingjay\\", and with this newfound maturity, we actually get to see her interact with the other characters.  Through the friendships she forms with the other victors she becomes far a more remarkable character.<br /><br />Collins managed to through me for a loop with some of the twists and turns that she threw into this book, which was really refreshing.  With a lot of series, by the time you get to the last book you can pretty much call everything that will happen, but that was not the case here.  With every chapter I was left guessing how the book would end.<br /><br />So why only a 4 star?  Well, for me, it was the ending.  The build up to it was wonderful but when I got down to the last pages, I felt like it was rushed to a close, and it left me feeling disappointed.  I really wanting to know more.  It was like there was a gap--a big chunk missing from the story.<br /><br />Even with my feelings at the end, this was still a great read, and I highly recommend this series.

B007SGM084|1.0|Women are not the dumb Bella of Twilight. I struggled through this book in my reading group, and felt that it was an insult to women and sexuality. A spanking does not hurt that much! And the endless whining... ugh!<br /><br />I was sorely disappointed by the end of the first book.  The second book was slightly better but I felt the writing was at a second grade level.  I imagine next there will be an illustrated comic to make even more money off this poorly written tripe.
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|At first sight game looks boring so don't judge this app by its cover cause it is so addictive. Didn't take long to learn how to play then I couldn't stop. ;)

0439023521|5.0|Gripping, disturbing and pack full with suspense. The Hunger Games is a must read!<br /><br />I'll be honest; I tried to stay away from The Hunger Games. I even ignored the movie previews. It wasn't until after I had had many people tell me to read it that I finally decided to give in and see what the hype was about.<br /><br />When I picked up the first book yesterday, I had no clue what it was really about, which in turn made it that much better. After the first 50 pages I really wasn't sure what to think other than, Wow, this is just so wrong. But as wrong as it was, I just couldn't stop reading. Even though I knew it would only get worse I tried to tell myself that nothing could happen that was worse than what had already happened to Katniss.<br /><br />I was wrong. Each time I thought we were bound to see a happy moment more danger was thrown in and I was at the edge of my seat, cheering, crying, and plain freaking out for the characters. The violent concept of The Hunger Games is barbaric but also amazing.<br /><br />And of course, the ending had me hanging on to the very last word. I cannot wait to start the next book.

B0053O89WY|5.0|As always, The Big Bang Theory never fails to make us laugh! :)<br />The product arrived quickly, and played perfectly.
1451627289|5.0|This novel is excelent, you will be catched from the first pages until the end. One thing I didn't like is that since the author has to tell a story of several years, there are time jumps which could have resulted in very nice (sub)stories like the ones that were actually written. I understand that is impossible to describe every single day of a 10 years time span though, but when you are reading this novel, you would like it to be possible.
B007N0AEWY|5.0|I first saw and heard Nick Waterhouse on the LFDH (Live From Daryl's House) internet music show and I was hooked right away!  I wish I could get the tracks he sang with Daryl and his band beacuse they were a fabulous combination.  After the show I came straight to Amazon to see if he (Nick) had a CD out.  I'm so happy that he does!  Fun music that you'll want to listen to on repeat for hours on end.

B004LWZW7E|1.0|Oh no help me my movie career is over. This movie should have used beauty instead of time. JT is losing his looks faster than Bruce Jenner. This movie is sooooooooo bad! Its a decent semi-fresh idea that is executed very poorly. This movie is not Tebowriffic it blows and JT is bringing horrible long boring dumb and dull back.
B000GGOCIE|5.0|This book is one of my all time favorites! I keep having to buy new ones, because I am always giving mine away. This is the kind of book that you can really sink your teeth into, with great characters and detail. This is King Arthur revisited, from the viewpoint of all the women! Eye opening, spiritual, and simply beautiful.

B007KOYEOC|2.0|If I was the author, I would have written it under a pseudonym as I would have been so embarrassed to be her children . The sex becomes tedious and repetitive and an unnecessary fill in . It is poorly written , and although the storyline does develop and becomes intriguing, I am disappointed at the lack of depth behind the characters. You don't really find out how badly Christian was scarred emotinally during his childhood which makes him the way he is . Anastasia's character annoys me intently, one minute she leaves him cos she is freaked  out by his sadomasachism and then she is desperate for it. The end is so weak - its almost like the author was bored and just wanted to finish it. The book could have been written in one ! Saved some of us a lot of money.Perhaps for once the film might be better than the book!
B007SGM084|5.0|This has to be my favorite novel. I have read them twice because I can't get enough of christian and ana.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really hated for this book to end however was unable to put it down.  Never knowing ahead where the book would take you but rushing toward an outstanding ending.  Never enjoyed a trilogy more.
B0021L8UPS|5.0|This movie is awesome. It's a thriller and suspense and I loved every minute of it. The acting is an A+ for me as well. i loved every single minute of it.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|It took me a few chapters to get into this book but once I figured out the characters it was very entertaining and spellbinding to say the least. I can hardly wait to dig into the next book in the trilogy.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Definitely amazing what Adam overcame and what he accomplished in his life.  He overcame what ever<br />obstacles came his way.  Helps us in our own lives to be Fearless as well and accomplish our own goals.<br />A real good read
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Waited to read the last book because I didnt' want the story to end.  I like the ending very much.  I'm happy with the outcome.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The second book in the series had me spell bound throughout as did the first.  Action twists at every turn of the page. Never knowing what would happen next.  Very enticing read as I have never reads three books so quickly.

B0002KQNJU|5.0|Polanski showcases himself and his wife, the late beautiful Sharon Tate in this quirky yet horrific vampire movie. Of the 60's period, costumes, hairstyles, etc., lend themselves to the whole of a quite original storyline for the time!<br />Who doesn't love the 60's? In a true deliberate style signatured to Polanski, we follow the trials of an innocent yet determined and committed student of a professional slayer that find themselves in the midst of a village dominated by a nearby lair. Rejoice, revel, review the 1960's in this most original never duplicated Vampire movie. Sharon Tate, immortalized in \\"Valley of the Dolls\\" but elevated to Goddess in this role!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game has a very nice blend of hidden objects, puzzles and logic. Just the right amount of difficulty for me, with a good storyline to boot.

B007SGM084|5.0|The 50 Shades Trilogy was definitely worth the money I paid for it!  A true and total page turner that kept your interest even when you needed to put it down.  The characters were riveting and the love story inspiring!!!! I would recommend this trilogy with very high regard...because I can!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really enjoyed this and would definitely recommend reading it as one longish book - not sure the five individual stories would hang independently.  While completely different, \\"Wool\\" reminds me of Asimov's \\"The Foundation Trilogy\\".  It moves along nicely and has enough surprises to keep you guessing.  Criticism?  Just one, I think they could have come up with a better title.
B005ZO6NRA|3.0|But he in the version of the tale was nothing compared to this one.  Better acting, better story line, etc.  All in all, both movies are mindless brutality, and really dumb, but this one is better.

B005LW5J9O|4.0|More like attending a prolonged college lecture than reading a book. The subject matter was very interesting. It is surprised me how many concepts I considered advanced and modern were swirling around the heads of philosophers more than 2000 years ago. I wish Greenblatt would have listed Lucretius's ideas at the beginning rather at the end of book.

I opened it to read earlier in the day and found myself unable to put it down....I had to know what was going to happen next.  I am excited that Walking Disaster is coming out and from Travis' point of view!  I am curious to know what is going through his head.  This was a quick and easy read I recommend it to anyone.  Yes Travis is quite protective, but I am very glad to see Abby has enough backbone and smarts to not put up with his crap.
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|This production is suitable for all ages. It is very inspirational and motivational. Learn about what sushi is all about, the art and hardwork behind it. It takes a good sense of taste, smell, patience and passion to be a successful sushi chef. It is team work. The movie also gives an insight to how commercialized sushi has affected the industry, the quality of sushi, and how it has affected the nature.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|In Greek Mythology Prometheus presumed to steal fire from the gods for the progress of mankind. He was banished, punished and bound for daring to interfere with domain of the gods.<br /><br />Similarly the author of Frankentein called her book the modern Prometheus, where a scientist presumed to usurp the very process of creation itself, and created a monster using lightning.<br /><br />In Prometheus the movie scientist Elizabeth Shaw played by Noomi Rapace, and her partner makes a series of scientific discoveries which shows that we were put here by extraterrestrials, and embark on a funded mission to a distant planet to meet these aliens.<br /><br />While the scientists aims are pure other people on board have mixed agendas. We have a soulless humanoid played by Michael Fassbender, and a ruthless female leader played by Charlize Theron and the mysterious owner of the company.<br /><br />Director Ridley Scott directed the Aliens series starring Sigourney Weaver, and I think Prometheus will please fans of Aliens and win new fans. Like Aliens we have a heroic female protagonist played by Noomi Rapace from the Girl with the Dragon tattoo series. Their arrival on the planet sets in motion a series of events with implications beyond the mission.<br /><br />While it appears to be a dead planet there is mischief on board the craft and danger on the planet itself.<br /><br />The alien planet is menacing as you expect, (so rarely do we meet friendly aliens), and if there are alien life forms they may not be friendly.<br /><br />There are several surprises and some well crafted scenes, which were quite originally done, including the duffel bag, and an improvised medical procedure which I found highly intriguing.<br /><br />One of my favorite lines from the movie: 'We may have gotten off on the wrong foot.'<br /><br />I love movies with a strong female protagonist, and Noomi Rapace really excels at this type of role. If you have seen the Alien movies, I think you will appreciate that he has given a style of science fiction that he pioneered a fresh and interesting twist. Who can forget that famous scene with John Hurt in the original Alien?<br /><br />Will Prometheus spawn a sequel? You could argue that it already has. I cannot speak as yet to how it will be on Blu Ray except to say that it was a visually stunning experience in the theater.<br /><br />I think you will enjoy it, and I hope this was helpful.ate that he has given a style of science fiction that he pioneered a fresh and interesting twist.

B007MC0IAG|3.0|Dawkins is an excellent writer when he sticks to the science. This book appears to be an exercise in converting the less educated to a rational empirical view. Good luck with that!(sincerely). For anyone who has read much popular science the tone is condescending and the content dumbed down to a point where it fails to exercise the intellect.

B0083EW97W|3.0|When John Mayer first hit the radio, I couldn't stand his music.  His music didn't stand out to me at all but, I was already jaded against modern music.  The album Heavier Things caught my attention and, since then, I've felt compelled to listen to every album he puts out.<br /><br />Born and Raised is a decent album.  Some of the songs influence me with the music.  Some of the lyrics are worthy of reflection.  But, many of the songs just don't do anything for me.  His lyrics capture some tender thoughts and emotions but, they do more to characterize the things other songs make me think or feel, rather than elicit those thoughts and emotions themselves.  Some of the music is pretty, some of it is catchy but, buying this album was more of a curiosity than a have-to-have purchase.  I was really persuaded into this purchase when this album was part of an amazon.com promotion for $5 albums.  After really listening to the album as a whole, I think it was worth every bit of $5 but, it's not an album I can just devour.<br /><br />I think Mayer's music has potential and, I think that's why I have to sort of \\"review\\" each album for myself.  Hopefully, this album is another stepping stone for further musical development.<br /><br />If I were to select songs to put together what I thought to be a \\"good\\" album from this young man, at least three songs from Born and Raised would be included in my song selection.

B008B11R1Q|2.0|LOVED their 1st album...LOVED Jaime's Scott Heron project...so i ordered the deluxe vinyl edition of Coexist and waited impatiently.  having built that anticipation, i had one of the biggest musical disappointments of the year from the first few seconds.  the sound was reminiscent of the first album but not better or surprising, but the lyrics...OH my goodness the lyrics: they practically made me barf.  literally, i expect this kind of sappy love song from teeny boppers.  you know: it would be the \\"mature\\" slower song on today's britney spears debut (I'm proud I don't know names; The xx 1st album is about as mainstream as i can tolerate).<br /><br />anyway, the rest of the album was better, but i was so disappointed in the 1st track - in shock practically - that finishing the album felt like a kid forced to finish brussels sprouts.  i'd take a break momentarily, and really not want to continue.  that's one vinyl i don't see playing again.<br /><br />believe me, it makes me very sad that this is the un-exaggerated truth i perceived.  i feel a duty to share the experience.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Excellent book well written. Grabs your attention don't want to put it down. fell in love with the main character immediately.

B001V5CIFI|5.0|What a funny movie!  My girls and I love wathcing it together.  Great family movie.  My girls watch it over and over again.
B000FC1MM8|3.0|The Last Coyote is a book worth reading. It has the required characters (the Kindle search feature is great when you come across a name you can't remember well), and the twists and turns to keep you guessing. I could identify with Harry Bosch and the coyote angle. And as usual, a twist at the end that catches you by surprise.

B00023B1AS|5.0|Most ZZ Top music has a good strong beat, which is great for exercising. This is a great collection of those songs and includes a great portion from Eliminator. We play this in our gym and the video, along with the music, keeps the intensity of our exercising up.
B0013AZLP0|5.0|Just a really great sound track.  I love the movie and the background music as well.  My husband and I are using some of the tracks to set our honeymoon video too.  Very compelling score.  Enjoy it!

B008MG1E4A|4.0|I found this to be a solid account of the raid, and the days leading up to it. I know, and have worked with, a number of SEALs over the years, and found descriptions of equipment and tactics to be accurate. I also saw no evidence of classified information being revealed in the book. It was a good, quick read - it provided little new information, but was a good description of the raid.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I read it out of curiosity, tried it for the heck of it, and feel so much better I'm never going back. A lot of issues I had cleared up completely or were greatly reduced inside of two weeks-- heartburn, skin issues, stiff and painful joints...it is a committment to cooking differently, but that said, there are plenty of recipes, lots of 'community' support, and the alternatives are delicious. Getting rid of wheat is not much of a sacrifice at all if you are willing to do a little planning, a little cooking, and let go of the 'healthy whole grains' idea.
B000W93CHC|1.0|I returned to read another K. Follett book based on Amazon reviews. after swearing them off as pulp. World Without End is an embarassment...not worth the 1000 pages or time. Predictable equivalent of a soap opera.

B005LAIHY0|5.0|The movie is one of the best SCI-FI movies in years and the story a brilliant one that gets better with each viewing. Forget the people who only half watched it, they are not paying attention to a hundred little things that the film handles so well. It all makes sense, is beautiful to look at and one of the most suspensful smart movies in years. I wish we had filmmakers out there that would put this much energy and love into the genre. Highest rattings from me.
B0096DFBZQ|3.0|not as good as I thought it would.takes up too mutch memory and not that fun.bad controls.gets annoying.not full virsion.
B008Y7GPY6|2.0|Sorry not for me. I watched the entire thing overall I feel it was a waste of time. Very one-layered. Good acting but then again it was all in a box.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl was a captivating read.  The characters were interesting and difficult to second-guess as the plot took many turns.  The ending was anti-climatic however and left me wishing the author had developed more to the finish of story as it was disappointing.  It felt as though the Author lost interest in the conclusion as did I.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|Really enjoying this book. There's lots of twists and turns. You don't know who to trust or who is good or bad. I can't wait to read the next book.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I had been looking for a good coin dozer game. Everyone that I found had to be payed for though. When I saw that there was a free one I got it. I didn't expect much from a free game but it actually is really fun. You get to collect prizes and puzzle pieces. There are different levels and you can never run out of coins because you automatically earn when you are off of it.
1401322786|5.0|A compelling tale about the beginning of time and its founder, Father Time. He is punished for measuring God's greatest gift and has to live in a cave for thousands of years listening to the pleas of mankind wanting more time. He is given the chance to redeem himself by finding two troubled people on earth and teaching them the true meaning of time.<br /><br />Mitch Albom is a gifted storyteller and this story bestows a powerful message.<br /><br />In his acknowledgments, he states to his faithful readers, \\"may I continue to provide you a fraction of the hope and inspiration that you provide me\\". My response to this would be, Mr. Albom, after reading \\"The Time Keeper\\" you have truly inspired me and given me hope.<br />Thank you for that.

030746363X|5.0|This was a great book.  I would highly recommend it to anyone from fitness freak, to beginner.  If you think you know it all, read this book.  If you've never lifted a weight, even to move it out of your way, then read this book!  It is full of knowledge.  Knowledge that you can't google or find in a dusty corner on the top floor of a library named after some professor who wrote some university a check.  This book is a must read in the fitness and diet world.  There is also further information that you wouldn't expect that just aides you in everyday life.  Honestly, for the price, you're hurting yourself by not buying this book.
B008QZ1ZYQ|5.0|Very great game!  Wish more versions were coming out.  I cannot put my kindle down because of this app.  I like Greedy Spiders 2 better than the original.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Had this game (and the halloween version) for iTouch and loved them! be patient at first it takes a while to get coins but prizes and leveling up shortens the time it takes to regenerate and soon you'll have more coins than time to play. awesome awesome game

B008220DIC|5.0|This is a film about people searching desperately for a key to unlock the secrets of existence. And it focuses on two characters: one who can find no such key and one who convinces himself and others that he has found such a key. The former is Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix) who we first meet on an unnamed beach in the South Pacific during the last days of WW11 and who we follow for some time as he unsuccessfully struggles to quell internal turmoil and establish some semblance of normalcy in post-War America; and the latter is Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who is also battling unnamed dragons but who seems to have found some form of inner peace as the leader of an order/cult that promises members that human perfection is achievable in this lifetime if members allow themselves to be unlocked by Lancaster Dodd's magic key (which he calls processing). When Quell stows away on Dodd's yacht the two seem to recognize some common quality in each other. Dodd takes an interest in Quell's curious life, and as Quell learns more about Dodd's methods so do we. Processing is essentially psychoanalytic questioning that seeks to help members identify and neutralize past traumas so that they can eliminate negativity from their present lives and achieve that hoped for perfection. Its psychoanalysis but its psychoanalysis with a difference, the difference being that members are encouraged not only to recall past experiences but also to recall past lives. A lot has been made of the fact that this philosophy is loosely based on L. Ron Hubbards Scientology, but the film is less interested in the specifics of the actual philosophy than in the need of its followers to believe in something. This desperation to believe in something, however outlandish, is what interests PT Anderson (and what will resonate with audiences). This film is as intense as they come but its long and is not as consistently entertaining as the directors previous work (although for all of the reasons just mentioned it is his most ambitious and interesting). Its most powerful moments come when Dodd plays psychoanalytical father to lost pupil Quell. Quell's desperation and Dodd's need to dominate his pupil is palpable in these scenes that are unlike any I've seen in an American film. Quell's need to accept Dodd as a father figure is matched by an equal need to reject him as  a guru. We're not asked to accept Quell as any kind of hero, just as an eternally lost soul. Freddie Quell, an existentially lost man for whom there are no answers, stands as the perfect antithesis to Lancaster Dodd, the man who refuses to live in a world where there are no answers (even if this means that he himself must invent those answers as he goes along). This is as existential as American filmmaking gets. There Will Be Blood may have wider appeal because it is about something all Americans can relate to, Greed. This film is about something fewer Americans will connect with: the meaninglessness of existence (or at least the difficulties of living without any existential certainties). This film is two hours long and there are no obvious payoffs, and some may hold PT Anderson accountable for the fact that there are no transcendent truths in The Master. But that is what makes this film so unusual and so daring.tioned it is his most ambitious and interesting). Its most powerful moments come when Dodd plays psychoanalytical father to lost pupil Quell.

B003R4ZMJU|5.0|I missed part of the pilot episode and watched the rest of the season with it growing on me. With season 3 on a break,I thought I'd purchase the streaming episodes from Amazon Prime, watching it on my tv via Roku. It's weird seeing how the cast in general looked and functioned then and now. It's nice to refresh my memories and not have to the box set of DVDs taking up real estate in my entertainment cabinet. From the time Alison disappered, and her body being discovered, to the four former best friends reuniting and getting notes and texts from A, to them trying to make sense of their lives and tracking down who A is. Great for fans or introducing it to new ones.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I have searched the market so many times looking fir an app like this I have had like 10 different apps for notes just to keep them seperated and this is awesome I can put my diary on 1 and health and recipies and so much more its so helpful and you can personlize it to you by pitting how many pages lines or no lines color and font its awesome get this app no lie like right now!!!!!!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Terrific, I loved it, can't wait to read the rest of the series! Amazon makes it so easy to get the books on Kindle.
B005HCI72O|5.0|I loved this book and could not put it down.Looking forward to the next book in series.<br />Outlander 4 really gets you hooked and makes the charaqcters come to life.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|An extremely well written book that is too hard to put down!!!!  Can't wait to start Book Three and I know when I am finished with No. 3 I will be sad there are not more books in this series!!!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Awesome. Really helps with writing and really is easy to understand with the pictures to help you see how to set up the ms word document.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|Some great songs on this album. Really energizing. An excellent workout album. I particularly like the song \\"Lucky Strike\\". Highly recommended!
B004UID2LC|3.0|at first it worked but over time it started not to want to play some videos and now the damn thing doesn't play any videos at all
B002RB7VMA|5.0|I shouldn't be surprised about how much i liked this album. It's Michael Buble after all! I enjoyed most of the songs. After a long day at work and school, I just like to listen to Crazy Love because it relaxes me like nothing else. Definitely recommended!
B004J4WKTW|2.0|Just wasn't crazy about this book, and don't recommend it at all. Just a little too imaginary for me. Also, it kept changing years and was hard to follow. Carol M. Geden
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|In the reviews for this film, which has at present a 94% rating on RottenTomatoes.com (hint: that means ONLY 6% of reviewers that saw it didn't like it), the negative ones say that (paraphrasing) \\"it lacks substance\\" or \\"it's a $250 million toy commercial\\" or \\"it's all flash\\". This is America and everyone is entitled to an opinion. But for the life of me, I cannot understand why people think this. I've been a student of film all of my life in one way or another and this film is the very definition of excellent ensemble and technical filmmaking.
B0087HT36U|5.0|It is fun to play. It works great on my Nexus. Some of the levels are hard. It has been one of my favorite games to pass time with
B008UUPOVM|1.0|big owl city fan from fireflies and before. thought he had a very unique quality - obviously he's been swallowed up by the machine because this whole album is so bland and similar that you really wouldn't be able to pick out a favorite song, only one that doesn't sound so bad. such a shame  - i would love to get my 8 bucks back. i simply will not waste any of my limited music time trying to delve deeper - it's just empty and hackneyed.
B008OTTRXU|3.0|When Call Me Maybe came out, I was one of many people who found it innocent fun. In fact, it was one of my jams this summer. So, I probably had high expectations for this album. While some of the tracks don't disappoint, Curiosity, This Kiss and More Than A Memory, the rest of the album felt a little flat to me.<br /><br />While the 80s vibe is very apparent in the collection, there was something missing to the songs. Tiny Bows left me questioning if I wanted to even bother with the album. Then things kicked off and did well, other stand outs are Your Heart Is A Muscle and Guitar String will most likely see success on the charts.<br /><br />A decent effort by all means, with just a little reservation needed.
030758836X|5.0|I love a good thriller, so when I happen upon one as funny, brilliant, and twisted as Gillian Flynn's \\"Gone Girl\\", the first thing I want to do is evangelize for it. This, of course, is the trap laid for anyone trying to review a book that prides itself on plot: the act of talking about what makes it special has the effect of degrading the experience for anyone who takes my advice and reads it. Even this admission does a disservice to the book. \\"Gone Girl\\" isn't a \\"Sixth Sense\\" or a \\"Saw\\", a story dedicated to preserving tension as it lumbers toward a twist that invalidates what's gone before. I want to make this clear: \\"Gone Girl\\" does not cheat, and while it tantalizes, it does not tease.<br /><br />The premise is deliberately familiar. Nick and Amy Dunne, once happily married in a luxurious NYC brownstone, are now quite unhappily married in a rented house in Carthage, Missouri, victims of the recession and their own human failings. On the morning of their 5th anniversary, Nick has breakfast with Amy, leaves to do... something, and returns later in the day to find Amy vanished and the house showing \\"signs of a struggle\\". This, at least, is what Nick tells us; his self-conscious narration comprises much of the book. Amy also puts in a few words for herself in the form of strangely detailed diary entries leading up to the day of her disappearance.<br /><br />It is quickly apparent that these peoples' lives are saturated with deceit. As soon as Nick summons the police to his house he begins to lie to them, a fact he admits to us with some chagrin but not much guilt. At the same time he's coming clean to us about his lies to the police, he's being suspiciously cagy with the reader. His wife's diary entries reveal things that Nick sidesteps or never mentions, and he still won't tell us what he was doing during the hours his wife disappeared. As Nick confesses, he's \\"a big fan of the lie of omission\\".<br /><br />In more standard thrillers (Harlen Coben, etc) the mysteryand the tension is focused on events. What happened when, who knew what? Obviously the events in this story are crucial, but their revelation occurs though the gradual unmasking of these two central characters. What a person can be imagined to do hinges on who that person really is. As these characters are revealed to us, what we believe about their true capacity for violence and deception informs everything we've learned. Character is the true source of tension and dread in \\"Gone Girl\\", and the result is phenomenal.<br /><br />I don't want to say much more about the narrative besides this: there are three parts to this book, and if you put it down before you reach the second, you'll have cheated yourself out of something spectacular. I'd been reading slowly but steadily up to around 48% in the kindle version, intrigued and enjoying myself, but not yet fully sold. At 52% the true weight of the narrative kicked in and I stayed up till the early morning to devour the second half in a single sitting. The ending is nothing I expected but perfectly suited to what the narrative deserves. This is a masterpiece: thrilling, funny, insightful, and terrifying. A thriller in the first degree.
B0086449YA|5.0|This is an excellent 2-CD set from Mark Knopfler and because of a dispute with Warner Brothers, it will not be released in the US!!! This is not right.

B0009QZ4CE|5.0|This album is the one that finally turned me on to VDGG.  It's a spooky and emotional roller-coaster ride through Peter Hammill's brain.  Now I want to go back and try Pawn Hearts again, which didn't grab me the first time.  People who enjoy this may want to try Fripp's \\"Exposure\\" album, on which Hammill sings a couple of knockout numbers.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Pinterest is great fun but the app wont always open or it opens slow. I am still learning how the rest of it works.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|Great book! Just wish it was available in audio for the Kindle Fire.  My son listens to this on<br />    Ipad @ school.
B009329Y30|4.0|If you're looking for a sappy chick flick romance this is for you.  A story about a veteran suffering from ptsd who wonders why he was spared when so many others weren't.  He finds a pic of a woman and when he comes home after trying to fit in at home and not succeeding he sets out on a journey to find the woman in the picture that he feels saved him from dying.  Much drama and romance ensues, but it's a worthy story.  Be sure to have a hanky on hand as there may be a couple of tearful moments.  This is definitely NOT a comedy, so if that's what you're looking for then pass this one by.
B008D28HYS|5.0|Wonderful game that is very addicting.  I want to get the black and white version too.  It's getting very challenging.
B007V508CC|4.0|Maroon 5 goes more pop with every album, and though I still prefer their first work, this one is very fine and brings good mood every time you listen.
B0096DFBZQ|2.0|This is no more than Namco's horrible version of Mario Kart.  The controls are bad and the fact that its not disclosed that this is NOT the full version until after youve downloaded is very misleading.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I really enjoyed the book and the way the author included his background information.  I thought the information on the white house leaks confirmed what I thought happened.  I applaud the author's courage in presenting the information.  The story had to be told and I am glad he did it.
B006CED4W4|5.0|it is just a really great show love the new season so far ill continue to rent the old seasons on here
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Although the mission to kill OBL is the climactic episode of the book, there is much more to this book than that. It provides a very interesting look at the life of a Navy SEAL and insight into the tasks which have been accomplished by these warriors during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.
B00632HWOG|5.0|This is the second Greenworks product I have purchased from Amazon, it set up quick and worked well. Is light enough for a women to use, and battery lasted a good 40 minutes on the first use. The shipping was not great, box it came in was a bit mangled by UPS, but the inside box containing the product was fine.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|I really enjoyed reading the set of 3 books.. I would recommend them to anyone... i would read them again!!I would give it 10/10 for the story behind the sex!!

B009329Y30|5.0|I love Nicholas Sparks books and also love the movies. It was good and I think Zac Efron was a great choice.
B001AQT0RC|4.0|I love this movie, but I could never find it in Blu Ray at a store. It came fairly quick and I've watched it twice already.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|its a good game but I wish it would make it Easter to get coins but other than that its very fun and entertaining u could play it for hours
B0063IH60K|2.0|I loved this game on my HTC Inc 2, even tho the last update is crazy with very annoying video ads. But now I've upgraded to an HTC Inc 4 and forget it. I'll practice and get the high score for a game, then come back to it and the scoreboard will have rolled back to the previous winners!! As if I never played at all! Way frustrating. Probably will go to another game.
B008RJFRTK|3.0|It would also be nice if the search feature worked.  A real benefit would be a directions feature. Just a suggestion.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|Fun to play, slow loading though sometimes. Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
1594135851|5.0|I read this book so fast and had to order the next one immediatly.There was 2 days between while I was waiting for delivery and was having trouble waiting. It might be my favorite out of the three!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|You can't beat a first hand account. The author lived it and told his story<br />as it was without bluster and hype. As he said there are many like him doing the tough jobs everyday without looking for fame or TV exposure.
B008BIN9EW|4.0|I really like turn based strategy games on mobile platforms, and this is a good one. Reminds me of Starcraft with the different races and abilities available. The campaign is fun in that it makes you try all the different races, instead or just sticking with your favorite. The graphics and maps are pleasant to look at, and the controls are easy to grasp. A nice, fun little game that I am really enjoying. The developer could also take this engine in other directions with slight changes. Thanks for listening, now go pick up this little gem!
B007MDK4XQ|4.0|The last words of Hitchens are the draw - he was one of the great journalists of our times. It contains a few classic chapters but the book is way too short. It should be cheaper. I get the feeling it is a cash grab by his heirs.
B002VHI8J0|5.0|I became obsessed with the film trailer and bought the Kindle book to find out what so intrigued me. A week later I had succumbed to the magic of David Mitchell's writing. The film will be something else again, but the book enables me to create my own mental images of these wonderful stories. Stick with it and all will be well - just like life really.
B007M45PMU|5.0|I bought this album mistaking it for a Jack White project band. Boy, was I wrong.  This album maybe one of the greatest in my collection.  Buy it now!!!  You won't regret it
B0084IG8TM|1.0|This is a guy's opinion, first of all. I never read the books but 5 minutes into the movie it screams pro-feminine propaganda all the way. To the point that it seems all men are either able to do something but drunk all the time, or they can't do a thing and must be tended to like a pet. That is not an exaggeration, it's that obvious and that bad.<br /><br />Now for the story. Whoa, bad. Unfeasible is too light a word to describe it. No way in the future of America will people willingly let the government randomly take children just so 24 enter and 1 leaves. American people have been and always will be armed, even after the government is gone. This kind of behavior just does not work in our society. Granted this is a post-revolution future, but a revolution requires people with independence and the will to fight. In this version of the future they are sheep to the government. That is not what Americans will be, if there is a revolution all those sheep will not be around anymore. I cannot explain how little sense this story makes.<br /><br />To make things worse there is too much teen drama. Just way too much. When the action does happen the director simply zooms in at an odd angle and you can't see what is really happening. Whoever directed this movie needs to quit or actually go to classes on how to be a real director. Almost all the shots were done wrong. Really the only positive was the pretty face playing Katriss, but a pretty face alone does not mean a good movie. This is on the level of Twilight, teen girl fantasy.<br /><br />1 out of 5 stars review from a guy who has studied history and can smell BS scenario when it's in front of him.
0553801503|5.0|I am addicted to this series of books by George R. R. Martin.  It is the best series that I have read in a long, long time.
B003DNN0L2|5.0|The story and dialog are hilarious!  It's a great family movie because the kids enjoy the claymation and animal characters, but the humor is entertaining for adults.  This movie makes me laugh every time I watch it.
B0090EIILU|1.0|This is nothing like Borat or Bruno.  Sacha Baron Cohen should stick to what he's good at---unscripted comedies with shock factor.  This movie was a complete bore.  Not even Anna Faris could save it.
B005LAIHYU|1.0|Not sure how to rate this movie. It was just so, well, 'bad' overall that I had to leave. Weird or odd are better words yet they are not enough. The whole premise is very offensive to history but I'm cool with that if the movie is entertaining. This move is not entertaining. It's dance-fighting mixed with vampires, 2 genres tailored to women. I swear I'm tired of movies that only one sex can watch. Back in the day action movies were enjoyed by men and women now we get crap like this and women are just thrilled about it.<br /><br />By the way horrible all around, directing, plot, acting, fight scenes. I recall girl cousin bragging how there were 2 guys fighting literally on each other. Ick. Apparently vampires can make gravity go away, I don't know I'm not into Twilight and True Blood plus whatever else is out there. Just weird movie all together, when you watch it put your brain somewhere else for safe keeping to prevent damage.
1402712367|4.0|Ordered these for my students as part of their book report assignment...this version  is suitable for kids to understand and the storyline does not differ much from the original..will definitely be ordering from Classic Starts when it comes to buying classic kids books
B004NOH9LC|5.0|I've seen this movie twice, and I think it's highly underrated. The acting is great, the story is cute, the jokes are all good.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I honestly couldn't put this book down, and I have never read a romance novel before, let alone an erotic one. I would definitely recommend this to anybody who is moved by deep romance.
B009AMAK0E|4.0|After starring in the remarkable \\"Million Dollar Baby\\" in 2004, then following it up with the gritty \\"Gran Torino\\" in 2008, Clint Eastwood announced his \\"retirement\\" from acting, instead focusing on on directing/producing films.  When the script for \\"Trouble with the Curve\\" came along, though, Mr. Eastwood decided that it was too good of a vehicle to pass up.  Thus, in his return to leading-man status, the 82-year old thespian proves that his filmmaking (or film-choosing) instincts are as solid as ever.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, \\"Trouble with the Curve\\" focuses on Gus (Eastwood), an aged baseball scout who relies on his eyes, senses, and gut feelings to scout the top prospects.  The trouble is, his eyes are failing and his job is on the line.  As such, Gus's friend Pete (John Goodman) is concerned about him and gives a call to Mickey (Amy Adams), Gus's daughter.  Predictably, the father-daughter duo do not share a strong relationship with each, and that is tested on a road trip together to scout the newest \\"can't miss\\" prospect.  Along the way, rival scout Johnny (Justin Timberlake) teaches both parts of the duo a little something about each other and their lives.<br /><br />When evaluating \\"Trouble with the Curve\\", there is one thing that you must do: Absolutely DO NOT try to compare it to \\"Million Dollar Baby\\" or \\"Gran Torino\\".  It's not even so much that it doesn't measure up to those movies (although it doesn't), but rather that it takes a bit of a different tone.  It is a bit more light-hearted and not nearly as \\"life-or-death serious\\" as those other flicks.<br /><br />When looked at under its own merits, then, \\"Curve\\" is an excellent film that does everything it sets out to do.  The plot is interesting enough to keep you invested, the emotion runs high throughout, and the acting is superb.  Eastwood is his typical self, while Adams and Timberlake provide the much-needed camaraderie that a movie like this needs from time to time.  The characters aren't quite as fleshed-out as a normal Eastwood movie (in this case, there is more \\"telling\\" of emotions than \\"showing\\", generally speaking), but they are still engaging.<br /><br />Basically, \\"Trouble with the Curve\\" is a conglomeration of a number of different themes (aging, fatherhood, baseball scouting, etc.) that work not in isolation but blended together.  All those themes have been done better in other movies, but having them all play off each other still manages to produce a cinematic treat.  I hope Eastwood still continues to shine ON the camera as well as BEHIND it, but if this does turn out to be his final acting role, there is no reason to look back with any regret.'t quite as fleshed-out as a normal Eastwood movie (in this case, there is more \\"telling\\" of emotions than \\"showing\\", generally speaking), but they are still engaging.<br /><br />Basically, \\"Trouble with the Curve\\" is a conglomeration of a number of different themes (aging, fatherhood, baseball scouting, etc.) that work not in isolation but blended together.

B000UZNRS2|5.0|The action never stops coming.  It will keep you on the edge of your seat.  The suspense is great.  Baldacci does it again with Stone Cold action!
B006BAEQB2|3.0|I've read most of Gregory's books and enjoyed them. This one however, has so many characters and so many twists and turns in the plot that I found it confusing. It's too hard to keep track of the ever-changing loyalties. I'm hoping the author will simplify the sequel.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Grandsons love playing this on my Kindle Fire. It was free so what's to complain about? I'm old school and the birds can get you a little angry. lol
0393338398|5.0|A Must read for baseball junkies.  A Must read for financial \\"planners.\\"  This book shows what the little guy can do when he looks at the problem and Solves it with methods everyone else is avoiding.  A good amount of stats and history to back up the reality of the few years it captures.  Much better than the movie, it gets a bit more in depth as to Why MONEYBALL works.  I am going to go buy an Oakland A's hat right now...
B0055SWM08|5.0|realy love this game, I just wish they would have more puzzles. the music is nice and does not get annoying as you play.
0761169431|5.0|This was a gift for my 13 year old niece who is just discovering Star Wars and loves origami, so this was a perfect gift.  The origami is a bit challenging, which is good.  It includes special origami paper, so when folding the tie-fighter it has all the details on the paper. It has over 250 pages, so it is quite impressive.  I recommend this book to all the Star Wars, Origami fans out there.  Love it you will.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest! I am addicted!  It is so much fun looking for new pins to pin on your boards. It is the thrill of the hunt, collecting without the clutter. Those who don't pin are missing all the fun.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Outstanding!! As I was reading this book, I was made to feel as if I was right there. Excellent description of tense moments. It is amazing how their training kept them calm under extreme pressure.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|My father thought it outstanding & gave it to me to read when I was young. I thought it gorgeous & got it for my daughter, who, is loving it!
B00571F26Y|4.0|Enjoyed this book and have given up eating bread and cakes and all wheat products.<br />Its not easy but after the first week you feel so much better and the cravings lessen.<br />The book was a little over the top for  me on the chemisty side of things hence only four stars. \But when you next walk the supermarket isles you see what  he means about the range of wheat products.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Straight forward personal account of an integral TEAM member in the killing of Bin Laden. No attempt at personal glory but a very good explanation of what happened from someone who was part of an exceptional team of warriors. Strong enough to give credit where credit was due and some good humorous points as well. Definitely worth the buy.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Food, Inc. really opened my eyes to all of the horrible things that I knew I didn't like about factory farming and our nation's food system as a whole, but I had never seen before. If you care about food, watch this.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|The Building Your Book for Kindle was a useful, step-by-step instruction manual about the mechanics of putting together a Kindle book with Kindle Direct Publishing. It is based on using Microsoft Word to do the editing and construction. I found it easy to follow and it led me through the process without problems. My only complaint is that it is in pdf format, which is fine for viewing on a PC, but if it were also available in Kindle format, it would be much nicer to use. On my Kindle Touch I had to change the font size to read the text, then switch back when I wanted to read a normal Kindle book.
B001A4LYN2|5.0|There isn't much I could say that hasn't been said.  If you like great film, you have probably already seen \\"There Will Be Blood,\\" and if not you need to.  It is one of the greatest films ever made.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray, it's definitely solid.  It's a good crisp scan, much better than the hazy dvd I had of the film.  This is a film full of textures and darks and the high definition is practically a necessity for viewing it properly.<br /><br />Special features are still a bit slim, which doesn't make sense because other PTA films have had decent selections of features or commentaries.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|Good basic information of success as told by someone who has had success as well as a number of failures.  Other than not having billions in the bank my family and I can identify with what he writes about.  You can learn a lot about yourself when you stop and agree with Mark Cuban's subtitle, \\"If I Can Do It, You Can Do It.\\"

B002VXGW2E|4.0|This movie prompted me to read more about Julie's life. Fearless and adventurous, she made a difference. Enjoyable - do watch it!
B008WCP2PG|2.0|So bad...the acting...the 'story' everything was just so so bad.  The chemistry between Mike and his 'love' interest was non-existent.  Although Channing Tatum did look like an acting rock star next to whoever that lady was.  The ending was lacking...i'll just leave it at that.  Another indicator that an actual story line was not important in this movie.  Also the Matthew McConaughey strip scene at the end was soooo awkward, but to be fair I was praying the movie was over by that point, which thankfully it was, so it might not have been his fault.  I was just cringing throughout the whole thing.  I'm a female...I love hot naked guys, but I guess I need a little story time to go with it (Unless I am literally at a male strip club!!!) because Magic Mike was a disaster for me.  Disaster.......
B007IXWL2C|3.0|In order to get anything out of this book, you needed to have read the first two books in the series first.  It is what brings the whole thing to a closure.  It is by far the best of the three and without it, the others are just kind of silly.  I obviously recommend that you read all three or none at all.
B006HTUZ1C|2.0|The controls are clumsy. The game play is weak. As others have mentioned, it does not do math sideways which is very poor. It should work in all directions.
B004UC4HCG|5.0|I bought the Shuttle almost three months ago.  This was my first PC kit. I chose the add-on components based on descriptions in other reviews here, and used an Intel i7 CPU, Windows 7, and a SSD. I am using the Shuttle primarily as a HTPC.<br /><br />Pros: Performance is solid. Setup was manageable in time, cost and level of complexity. I enjoyed the challenge of putting it together.<br /><br />Cons: The documentation seemed somewhat incomplete and so I had to do some online study.  The biggest challenge was putting in the on-board wi-fi, because I had to locate the suitable hardware and drivers, and installation procedures were not obvious. While I was getting ready for the on-board wi-fi, I used USB wi-fi.<br /><br />I was willing to take the risk that the Shuttle would not perform as I hoped.  Having completed the project, I am delighted with the result.  In consequence of the good performance, I have cancelled cable TV and do very nicely with this and an internet connection.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This game is a lot of fun, but it can be very frustrating because the evil pigs are sometimes heavily fortified.  I've been trying to find a version to download to my PC but have not yet been successful.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|Pre-ordered and not disappointed. Yet again, Lee Child does not let us down with the twisting changing and fast paced action.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love pintrest and this app is better than the computer version! Easy to use and works great! I would definitely recommend!
B005LAIHY0|2.0|Visually, very nice to look at. Depth of plot was pretty shallow, and I think it stems from rushing to get the movie out. Alot of Sci-fi is about product placement these days, ie, models, statuettes, memorabilia. And as I was watching the movie I got that impression that that was one of the motives for getting this out. But what really drove me crazy about this movie, was the incessant background music. A droning muzak that droned on and on during scenes where the acting and dialogue would have sufficed. If you watch ALIEN, and then this movie, you see and hear the diffence. Amazes me that both movies came from the same director.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I'm very pleased with No Easy Day.  Not sure what all the controversy is about as the book seems to deliver exactly what the dust jacket promises: an honest recollection of the author's experiences while on the mission to kill UBL and as a SEAL in general.  It's simply an enjoyable book filled with personal anecdotes and insights into a well-respected yet mysterious group.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Mr. King gets better & better - this story was such a pleasure to read! Have to write 20 to get counted - just don't think you could go wrong with this one!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Not as exciting as the first book and I figured out most of the plot before it happened. But all in all a good book.
B005LAIHE0|1.0|It's been two days since I watched this movie and I've already forgotten what it was about. Yes, it was that memorable. No, I have a college-surviving level memory. I do, sort of, remember the already-seen-many-times plot line of sex, booze, food, romantic couple with divergent life goals, misunderstanding, and third party romantic episodes finally getting it together. All the aforementioned - formula studio script hooks.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is great! I love everything about it! and its free so hurry up and get it! WOO HOO!!!!
B0050PYNP8|2.0|If this movie had been a buddy bonding movie I would have given it three stars.  This movie tries to be a buddy-nerd bonding movie and it fails in that sub-genre.  To be a movie about nerds or geeks the characters have to have dialogue that is ecclectic and esoteric.  The characters have to say things that other geeks and nerds would understand and find interesting but that most people wouldn't.  In this movie there are no references to STOS, STNG, STV, Star Wars, Soylent Green, Planet of the apes, Thunderbirds, Dark Shadows, Night Stalker, et al.  There is one running gag about a fictional writer.  There is also a long diatribe agianst Christianity(although oddly nothing about Islam.)  For a movie about UFO's I wonder why they didn't have Art Bell do a cameo.  The protaganists in this movie might be geeks but we don't know because they never talk about anything that would be vaguely interesting to another geek.  They never mentioned D&D.
B0063IH60K|1.0|Its fun to play but the ads are really bad. even when you skip or exit they come back constantly.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This was a very good book. The author explains the op and his history with the team well, with just enough detail.  The book reads alot like other personal accounts from SOF vets and I have no regrets buying it!!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app is awesome. one of my most used apps. I never get let down. it tells u how much battery life is left in ur d vise.
B007Z9QS5K|2.0|i have a high threshold for bad rom coms but this one is so awful that in the first 2 minutes, i knew it was gonna suck. i was right, not 10 minutes in, i was contemplating just giving up on the movie and watch something else instead. disappointed is an understatement. avoid this movie or waste time at your own peril.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|One of my few discs I can just hit play on file 1 and let it roll through to the end of the playlist. One of the others go figure is Aim and Ignite.
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|I have had this book for about a month for a Book Club read. I am currently on page 139 as I just can't seem to get into this book. A little disappointed in the plot and how she has changed creatures to her liking and not what we would expect them to be.
B003O86FMW|4.0|The book had a very surprising twist and a few unexpected turns.<br />I enjoyed \\"Catching Fire\\" and it was as interesting as the first book.<br /><br />It left me wanting more.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Another VRMMORPG to add to my shelves, honestly I'm getting sort of addicted. Although Ready Player One had a lot of cool elements to it and a lot of more pop 80s culture references, I still like Sword Art Online better. Simply put, it has a better story and cooler characters. Nonetheless, Ernest Cline does a good job of creating a compelling and much bigger world. The nerd factor on this novel is just off the charts so I can see why so many people are hyped over it.<br /><br />My main problem is that in the entire novel I never liked the protagonist. He was nerdy but he wasn't cool nerdy or even clean nerdy. Honestly, how long can you avoid sunlight and outside contact in a room until you go crazy. Sometimes months were skipped in the entire book because Wade did nothing but stay in his room and watch movies for \\"research\\". Not to mention the small romance in this book that never really develops into anything cool.<br /><br />The first half was taxing so as a last note I would reccomend you stick in there if you are hoping the story to pick up because it really does. However quickly after it gets interesting it also gets very linear. A child could guess the entire plot 20 pages in. And the end is unsurprising.<br /><br />Also I just want to say that this is the first time I have ever read a reference to Cowboy Bebop and that is awesome. But Shoto got a lot less interesting once he decides to go along with Wade.
B004ZZS4CC|3.0|Very sad to read but thank God she survived this tradegy and is alive to tell her story.  This was written in her own words where she described her ordeal as best as she could understand at that time.  Her story could really upset some readers.
B008XG1X18|5.0|every one had been telling me for more than a year to try pinterest but I kept putting it off. it is the most fantastic site I have seen. I am hopelessly addicted.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  I enjoyed every word of it.  It is not what the News and the Political Pundants made it out to be, but it does clear up alot of questions that I had about Some politicians view of the killing of Osama Bin Laden........Thanks for setting the record straight..
B008220DIC|3.0|Come awards season, I certainly expect some acting nods to come to Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman for this Paul Thomas Anderson film saga.  Unfortunately for me, in spite of some great performances and technically wonderful artistry, I had problems with the story and where it was headed.<br /><br />In a long opening sequence, and on the eve of the end of World War II, Freddie Quell (Phoenix) is about to be discharged from the Navy.  His unusual behavior is questioned by the medical staff, but he is ultimately turned loose on society.  While in the Navy, he learned how to distill his own brand of hooch depending on what ingredients were available.  This includes a base of about anything that burns.  After a couple failed job opportunities due to his alcoholism, he stumbles upon a yacht being used by Lancaster Dodd (Hoffman), his family and an assortment of followers.<br /><br />Dodd is a successful leader of a new movement called \\"The Cause\\" which has a basic premise of individuals having past and future embodiment.  Dodd, known as Master by his followers, takes a liking to Quell and agrees to \\"treat\\" him for his need for booze as well as his violent and unpredictable behavior.  But why?  Is he so convinced of his beliefs and his \\"healing\\" power that he can convert Quell?  Is Dodd just a charlatan looking for a public example?  Or is there something more? There are no obvious answers although I have my own theory.<br /><br />While it is certainly not unusual for Thomas to take his time laying out his characters and the story, this time it didn't seem necessary.  Certainly of note is an excellent supporting cast including Amy Adams as Mrs. Dodd, Jesse Plemons as the son and Laura Dern as a financial supporter. The film is also buoyed by an excellent score written by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood.  Like most of Anderson's films, this one may resonate better upon an additional viewing.
B005COO1X6|4.0|Enjoyed \\"Mile 81\\" basically.  Stephen King is my favorite author.  However, this left me feeling unsatisfied.  Knew it would be short but it just ended abruptly, like he just got up from his desk and went for a beer after hitting \\"enter\\" on the keyboard.  Seriously though, it wasn't finalized for me.  It just left me hanging and I wanted more, at least an ending with some closure.  But, Mr. King works in mysterious ways and that is one of the many reasons we all crave his work.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is one of the best apps I have ever gotten.It is wonderful it shows you the Internet use and it is free I would reccomend this app to a friend most deffinatly
B0071CNGI8|4.0|it's better than the movie. I really liked the fact that the horse was telling the story....The trials and longing for his master is a new prospective for me.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|While completely unrealistic, this story draws you in and you cant put it down.  It is very fast paced and a joy to read.

B008MG1E4A|4.0|Great, straight forward, compelling narrative.  For a memoir, it was refreshingly humble.  There is no false modesty.  But, the author makes it clear that he is telling the story of the seals with examples from his own experience.  He doesn't sound like he has an ax to grind with the president.  But he tells about some mild mocking of the president, and Washington politicians in general.  But it comes off as the type of mocking anyone does when their experience is far removed from a different type of experience--the type of mocking that business people and academic economists might display.  There is not a lack of respect, just a stated feeling that the other has absolutely no idea how the real world works.  In other words, he tells about the shared mocking of the president that took place rather than using the book to mock the president.  It comes across as genuine and not angry.<br /><br />I've stopped reading Washington memoirs because they are usually written by those who have made a fatal political error and yet use their book to justify their missteps and subtly discredit their victorious opponents.  I suppose that the author of this book does something similar.  He, not so subtly, villanizes his opponents--terrorists.  He admits some of his own mistakes, but doesn't admit to any major errors.  Of course, this comes across as believable since any major errors and he would not be around to write the book.<br /><br />I suppose what sets this memoir apart is that the author writes after incontrovertible personal victory.  So many write after they have met their political end.<br /><br />I do think that Gary Schroen's \\"First In\\" is a book written from a comparable experience.  And yet, he seems to have some real bitterness against the military brass and one high level diplomat.  He never acknowledges any real errors or lapses of judgement on his part.  And it may be true that he got a raw deal.  But, there is none of this bitterness in No Easy Day.<br /><br />I really liked this book, both the story and it's tone.  And I think the book is a great addition to history.  The author seems to give an awful lot away from a tactical perspective.  But, if I were on a jury, I think I'd buy the defense that it was all given away in public sources by others already--particularly the political class.<br /><br />There comes to my mind, from the Funeral Oration of Pericles, these words, \\"Then in the studies of war we excel our enemies in this. We leave our city open to all men; nor was it ever seen that by banishing of strangers we denied them the learning or sight of any of those things which, if not hidden, an enemy might reap advantage by, not relying on secret preparation and deceit but upon our own courage in the action.\\"<br /><br />The author, and his team mates, are true heroes in the classical sense.  They are modern day versions of Achilles or Odysseus or the Spartans.  I'm truly impressed and grateful for the service they have provided our democracy.  In my mind, he's earned the right to speak freely.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|This book had a very similar format to the previous one, with lots of focus on certain characters (usually not in Westeros) and some from obscure people who you might not remember right away.  I felt like he lost some momentum with this book, as with the previous one, but it was still a very interesting read.  I recommend it, especially because the last books have to bring it all together and hopefully it will be worth it to have read them all.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is a good game but you need a few updates like mods bosses survival games on this app. I will be happy if u did
B003IY48PS|1.0|Honestly when I first purchased it I was really excited. Being able to see one of my all time favorite films on blu-ray would have been amazing...or so I thought. When I got this product and started watching it I noticed a few things wrong. First the menu, it was very cheap, low budget, and well over all it wasn't impressive. Secondly the film itself, two different version of it both complete pieces of crap. The original version didn't fit my screen at all, but what both of them had that was just god awful. The films themselves were horribly remastered for blu-ray. I mean so horrible I'm pretty sure dvd and vhs had out-beaten it in quality. The film was extremely grainy throughout most of the film, looked like sandpaper with the film printed over it with cheap ink. It was that bad. The audio quality seemed a bit better than the original but audio to visual ratio not worth it at all. I hate it so much I'm probably going to resell this pos. I own the other 2 of this series and I must say those are remaster very well. I have the 25th anniversary edition of Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness screwhead edition. I hope they have another version of this film with better quality because I feel cheated both out of money and out of loyalty to their fans. Do not buy!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I loved this book! Definitely worth the read. It does a great job of describing everyday life in a different time.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|good app but goes to the app when watching a video and you have to start it again but you should still get it
B009AMAK0E|3.0|Trouble With The Curve is a watchable film about an aging baseball scout facing problems with a changing game, fading eyesight and a difficult relationship with his daughter that he's running out of time to fix. In a lot of ways, it could have been the perfect counter-point to last year's excellent film Moneyball, showing the view of the veteran scouts and their traditional ways of looking for talent in contrast to the analytics-driven approach which now dominates the game. But in the hands of first-time director Robert Lorenz and first-time screen-writer Randy Brown, Trouble With The Curve never ventures beyond formula and manages to run for 111 mostly by-the-numbers minutes without a single moment of unpredictability.<br /><br />Gus Lobel (Clint Eastwood) is a man caught between the rocks of old age and failing eyesight and the hard place of trying to hang on to his job as a baseball scout as the whole nature of the business is changing around him, going from a hands-on gut feel approach to boiling down potential players into a set of stats on a laptop. His contract with the Atlanta Braves baseball team is coming up for renewal, but his bosses, team owner Vince (Robert Patrick) and manager Pete Klein (John Goodman) aren't sure if Gus is up to the job anymore. Especially with their up-and-coming scout Phil Sanderson (Matthew Lillard, oozing sleaze) telling them that Gus' way of doing things just doesn't cut it anymore.<br /><br />Ultimately, everything depends on a scouting mission Gus is set to handle: to check out a player named Bo Gentry (Joe Massingill, oozing obnoxiousness), a hard-hitter on a small Georgia college team who's viewed as a potential top pick in the upcoming draft.  Klein, who's a long-time friend of Gus's as well as his boss, gets in touch with Gus's daughter, Mickey (Amy Adams, shining brilliantly) a successful attorney on the brink of being made a partner at the law firm where she works. Klein tells Mickey his concerns and what's at stake for Gus if he blows this mission, asking her to go with Gus and keep an eye on things. Unwilling at first, particularly as her being made a partner depends on a big presentation she's to give for a major client in a matter of days, Mickey reluctantly gives in when she finds out about Gus's eye problems, telling her bosses that she has to take a couple of days off to deal with her father but that she _will_ be there to handle the presentation on time. While Mickey and Gus aren't exactly estranged, there is nonetheless a distance between them that neither seems able to overcome, making their relationship difficult at best and more often one of walking away with hands thrown up in frustration. Their only common ground, rather naturally given the film, is their love of baseball.<br /><br />While scouting out the intended prospect, Gus and Mickey run into Johnny (Justin Timberlake), a former pitcher first recruited by Gus who is now a scout for the Boston Red Sox, having been forced to find an alternate career after his arm gave out too soon. Johnny rounds out the odd trio, Johnny in his relationship to Gus as a former recruit and now rival scout, Gus with his awkward and ever frictional relationship with Mickey, and now Mickey who finds herself being drawn out in spite of herself by Johnny's almost clownish come-on's. And of course all three of them with their relationship with baseball, the one thing where they all find their moments of grace.<br /><br />It has to be said that if Trouble With The Curve works at all, it is in no small part because of Amy Adams' performance. In spite of Lorenz' mechanical direction and Brown's pedestrian script, Adams manages to make Mickey shine nonetheless, engaging you in ways that make you buy into her character even when you'd otherwise see no reason to. Some of her best moments are those in which she has no dialogue and it's just the expression on her face conveying what Mickey is feeling that make the connection. Her scenes with Eastwood and with Timberlake work because she makes them work, bringing a chemistry to the situations that keeps you watching and makes you care. Eastwood's Gus is adequate to the role, but only just, with Eastwood basically just playing the same role he's been playing for the last twenty years, largely glaring and growling his way through things, mostly relying in this case on the fact that at 82 he actually _is_ old instead of having to act old.  In the hands of a better director, Eastwood would almost certainly have given a better performance, but one of the problems with Trouble With The Curve is that Lorenz doesn't seem to know how to draw the best out of his actors or the situations they're in. Timberlake is not only largely wasted but in retrospect grossly miscast:  he would have been far more effective as Gus's in-house nemesis Sanderson. As Johnny, he really doesn't have much credibility or even reason to be there as you could pretty much cut all of his scenes and it wouldn't affect the main plot in the slightest. But at the same time, his scenes with Adams do give her even more opportunities to shine. One of my favorite scenes is in a country bar where Mickey pulls a reluctant Johnny out onto the dance floor for a throw-him-in-the-water lesson in clog-dancing.<br /><br />The other performances are a mixed bag, but two in particular stand out in ways that encapsulate the problems with the script and the direction.  Matthew Lillard's Phil is almost a caricature of a sleazey underhanded in-house rival to Gus, so over-the-top that you know from the moment he first opens his mouth that you're supposed to hate him. I think this could be something of a career problem for Lillard as he's gone from always playing goofy comic sidekicks when he was younger to now playing complete sleazeballs in recent years, most recently in The Descendants.  And Joe Massingill's Bo Gentry is so unbelievably obnoxious that it's a mystery why the rest of his team hasn't taken him out behind the stadium and beaten him to death with his own bat long before Gus and Mickey show up. If Trouble With The Curve had been an outright comedy, then both Lillard and Massingill's performances would've fit perfectly, but as it is, some subtlety was badly needed and unfortunately was completely lacking, the primary blame for which must be laid at the feet of Lorenz and Brown.<br /><br />One wishes that Lorenz and Brown had been more daring or ambitious, given the talented actors they had to work with, but they weren't. You can tell early on that before Trouble With The Curve is over, all problems will be resolved in true Hollywood fashion, the characters you like will all triumph in the end and the characters you dislike will all get their deserved comeuppance. One also wishes that they'd gotten a more experienced director and writer to begin with as quite frankly Lorenz and Brown display a lack of talent in both the direction and the writing. The one element of mystery in the film - the reason why Gus and Mickey have such distance between them - when finally revealed feels completely artificial due in part to the clunky way in which the foreshadowing was handled and in part to the fact that, once revealed, it apparently makes no difference to either character as the movie just returns to its original track. The editing is often jumpy in places instead of smooth, and apparently Lorenz never wanted to do more than one take because you're constantly seeing all of the major actors' eyes looking to the sides, apparently to read cue cards to get through their lines. A regrettable waste of A-list actors in the C-list hands of a first-time director and a first-time writer.<br /><br />On the plus side, the feel of the settings is well done, and you can believe that you're actually seeing Gus and Mickey doing a scouting mission in a small town where a local baseball star can be a big fish in a small pond. The music score by Marco Beltrami is also well done, setting the tonein the background without ever being intrusive so that you're barely aware that it's there, exactly the kind of score you need in a film like this.<br /><br />Recommended for Amy Adams' brilliant performance and for anyone interested in a film about baseball recruiting and doesn't mind if the rest of the film is routine and completely predictable.<br /><br />PS - A particular thanks to 'ellison' who corrected me in an earlier draft of this review when I mistakenly thought that the Grizzlies in the film were a minor league team. I didn't know that players in minor league teams were ones who had already been drafted as the minor league teams are owned by the majors.

B008MG1E4A|4.0|This book was an easy read.  The details of several missions the team conducted put you with the seals.  Seal team 6 are truly the heros that took out Osama Bin Ladin.  I would recommend this to anyone that is interested in current events
B005CRQ4XI|1.0|Suspense filled narrative. Facing down rattlesnakes & bears. Surviving record heat & snowfalls. Really? I kept turning pages waiting for SOMETHING even close to any of those things to happen. She sidestepped past a few snakes, briefly. Caught sight of a few bears, common when hiking most trails in the West Coast. She didn't survive (italics) anything. She was never even remotely close to death or in any real danger- except in her drug using & promiscuity. She had some inclement weather changes while hiking. The fact that she was always a few days away from the nearest town & ran into people constantly doesn't match the \\"Wild\\" title or what I'd expected from the book AT ALL. It's definitely NOT a book about being torn down by the wilderness & being built back up by it. What she went through could have been accomplished by  series of weekend hikes. The constant theme of her blackened toenails hurting & falling off (\\"she threw the toenail into the bushes\\") caused by her REI ill fitting boots was the worst thing that happened to her. Who cares?! She then goes into adjective & descriptive overload describing each event at each juncture of the trip, boring details of exactly how much money she has-it  never really relates back to anything to make a connection- she was not about to starve! A phone call away from supplies or money. Borrowing would have been simple from the friends she continued to make. She breezes by the majority of her hiking in less than a paragraph. Describing more of the actual scenery & relationship with nature, the healing aspects of the mountains, water, earth..... would have been far more interesting than her one night stand. (wild.....?)<br /><br />There was no emotional or mental breakdown or depth of anguish leaving her in a pit of despair in which to claw her way out. Her<br />family life & mothers death, while sad, seem commonplace in this world of dysfunction. Nothing extraordinary or eventful. No turning point or \\"ah ha!\\" moment of clarity.She just realizes some things about herself, past decisions, poor choices-  inevitable<br />enlightenment that happens to most people over time. She just speeds the process by self imposed semi-isolation that came about<br /> mostly because she had nothing going on & was broke! She didn't set out wanting to better herself or figure out why she needed<br />drugs or why she cheated in her husband. It wasn't a real vision quest or deep spiritual journey of self discovery. It's the complete<br />LACK of that, no questioning of immortality or spiritual existence that bugged me, especially due to the fact that she<br />was always referring back to situations with her mother and infidelity in her marriage & drug use. Her thoughts read as though she were just writing down random daydreaming thoughts.....no real tie into something bigger, no real self discovery or bigger meaning<br />that has a direct impact.<br /><br />The few paragraphs that ended the journey (long hike) had potential for some emotional closure, for her as well as the reader. It fell short. All the over describing would have worked, &  been welcome here. Then the few sentences that too quickly bridge the time gap between then & now,  felt so rushed.....as though she was out of time. Though it was obviously written in a way that tries, but fails, to be  creatively sentimental. It doesn't work.<br /><br />I find it strange that Oprah was so moved by it & confused while reading all the hugely complementary reviews. It's just wasn't THAT good!<br /><br />If the book was advertised for what it was: A diary of thoughts while hiking, I would not as felt so disappointed.
B0087HT36U|5.0|this game is a little like angry birds except you throw things to destroy structures. I like it a lot and its good for kids too.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|This app is awesome - I am so addicted to it!  I play it over again just to get characters I am obsessed with :)
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have had swiftkey for a long time on my thunderbolt and it is awesome, I am a huge fan
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is my favorite game on my kindle.  Everybody should get it. There is no lagging and you can buy coins at a low price.
B005K01VZS|5.0|Found this really a good read but did not know what the writer was getting at in some instances. Would recommend this.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|This is poor writing.  The author repeats herself several times.  The climax was shorter than one of their many sex scenes.  That's all the book was and the insecurity of some super control freak which the main character found a good thing.  I found myself skipping pages when they were going to have sex because it was always the same thing sparing some minor details.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|This was a great way to catch up on the series and well worth the money!! Go for it and enjoy!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|a neat app that gives one an idea of how to conserve the energy on their Kindle. It's quite thourough on the times of different battery life users. Not really anything to complain about,  just a useful free app.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Bought this for our 8-yr old who can't get enough of this movie, and especially the minions! The digital download when directly to his iPod Touch when we got it. He loves to watch it whenever he can!
0985114606|1.0|I personally didn't find this to be very good at all. Sorry, but it was very vague and limp, and I just kept thinking how similar a lot of its was to Fifty Shades of Grey.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Not sure why this book received so much hype. It's slow and the characters are like two kids on their first crush. I've read better erotic boks and recommend you should look at other books before getting this one. The remaining two books are just the same. Clearly the author doesn't know the S&M culture and should have done more research before using this as a basis for her subject. If you remember dime store novels, this one more like a nickel, just drawn out over many chapter.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I liked Fifty Shades Darker better than Fifty Shades of Gray because it provided some more insight into Christian Gray's past and how it affected his present.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book was so addicting I couldn't put it down. I ended up buying Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed, loved them all!!
B0098VYKSA|3.0|If I hadn't paid $4.99 to rent this movie, I probably would have enjoyed it more.<br /><br />Kristen Stewart proves yet again you don't need acting talent in Hollywood to succeed, just a half-way pretty face and a really horrible franchise that appeals to a niche audience, a highly publicized romance followed by a movie by a director who probably cast her for his own um, reasons.<br /><br />The movie is saved by the amazing special effects, great acting by the rest of the cast and, once again, a stellar performance by a true actress, Charlize Theron. The very idea Stewart could be \\"fairer\\" than the most beautiful woman in Hollywood, made the entire plot less enjoyable. To truly have made the story line believable, they should have cast another actress in the role of the Evil Queen. Or at least given us a more believable Snow White. Stewart was cast for the public appeal factor. But for those of us who are adults and hate the Twilight movies, she ruined the full enjoyment.<br /><br />There was little to no chemistry between Snow White and the Huntsman. Also, there was no reason for her not to fall for William. He was a great character, brave, loyal, handsome, had been fighting the queen his whole life and was clearly more suitable to be King. The Huntsman, on the other hand, was a man who \\"escaped\\" into alcohol, stood by and did nothing but brawl and owe other people money while the kingdom went to Hell in a hand-basket, and had no moral compass. Obviously an attempt to recreate the so-called \\"Love Triangle\\" in the Twilight series. His \\"bad-boy\\" persona was Cookie Cutter perfect with no thought or creativity put into  the character.<br /><br />Not a bad movie, all together, and good, mindless entertainment for a few hours. But if you're truly interested in watching, don't pay to rent it. Wait for it on Amazon Prime or Netflix.
B0087HT36U|5.0|I really liked Siege Hero.  The only problem is that the game didn't last long enough.  This little game needs about 20 or so levels, with more characters.  However, it was very enjoyable as it is.  THANKS to the developers.
B004OBQDHK|4.0|Keanu is constantly, and will probably always be, lampooned as the quintessential dumb surfer. This is the movie that started it. Well, this and Bill & Ted. But that's another review for a later day.<br /><br />Despite too many viewings with the film's initial release (WAY too many viewings), this BD release sells it dead on. The light off the water makes you feel right there with the waves rolling in at your face. Then there's skydiving, bank robberies, chases, etc. You've probably seen the film and you know just as well as I do that this is a really fun action flick. I haven't seen it in years until tonight. And it's still just as fun.<br /><br />If you have it already on DVD but are fence-sitting about buying the BD, stop fence-sitting and buy it. The picture quality and the sound is simply amazing.... A five-star event.<br /><br />But save yourself from watching the special features - they constantly say the same thing about everything and everyone. For 43 minutes. So, four out of five, just based on the BD release. It's a shame they couldn't do better. This is one of those films that deserves more than it got.
1469984202|4.0|I am not a huge sci fi fan but I was pleasantly surprised with Wool, in fact I am halfway through and don't want to put it down.I would have to give it 4 stars.Well done!
B0085OELXK|5.0|While this movie has an impenetrable darkness too it, it is one of the best and most compelling movies I've seen.  It has so many oddities that you do not find in other movies, and it really makes it something you want to watch again.  It really goes into the depths of humans and what we are capable of.  Matt Damon is superb in playing the role of this manipulative, creative wanderer known as \\"Tom Ripley\\".  Some people wonder why good people get unlucky in life and bad people get lucky?  Well this movie is that line of thinking being exacted out one hundred fold.  One thing to take away from it is that it doesn't matter in life what anyone else knows compared to what you know.  Whether or not you think you can handle it, behaving dishonestly or doing worse (like murder) will eat you alive from the inside out.  Even if you never get caught for something bad, it hurts you and manifests more positive energy into negative energy; thus be honest and do good if nothing else for the sake of your own opportunity to explore this wondrous and unknown life with a freedom of thought.
B000FBFMFW|4.0|The books of this series were my first experience of Robin Hobb.  All in all I found them enjoyable.  They reminded me in some ways of The Begariad books by Eddings that I enjoyed so much as a teenager.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|very addicting game.  lots to work towards don't like how long it takes to regen coins but oh well.  other than that its very fun
B003O86FMW|5.0|really enjoied the Hunger Games series! My friends were all talking about it so I gave in and read the first book, I was hooked and had to read the  entire series.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book reminded me of Valley of the Dolls.  Everytime you turned the page, it was nothing but sex.  If I had known this book was like this, I would not have purchased it.  I didn't even finish the book and probably won't.  I will not purchase the sequels either.  Maybe being born on the South and being a Christian, I am very disappointed.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Outstanding, one of the best books I have read.  If this book doesn't make you proud of our fighting men and women and just proud to be an American, nothing will.  After reading Lone Survivor and then No Easy Day, I think all retired Navy Seals should become authors.  The book was fast pace with no down time, I finished it in two days.  As I read the book I did not see anything giving away secrets or tactics that aren't common knowledge to anyone with any tactical experience. I had pre-ordered the book and it was on my Kindle as promise on September 4th.  I am now buying a hard copy so I can pass it around to friends and family.
B000YJ54DU|4.0|Reacher is just awesome!  Lee Child is just such a good storyteller. Loved it and recommend it for all Jack Reacher fans.
B0084IG7KC|3.0|Shipment was fast, the product was in great condition. The movie though was greatly over hyped. I guess I must have missed something pivotal or something.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|I haven't finished this book yet but I am a little disappointed.  I couldn't wait for it to come out after reading the first book in the trilogy. It was the only book I've ever pre-ordered.  I think I just don't like the characters in this book as much as the Fall of Giants.  I would have liked for Mr. Follett to have developed the characters a little more than he has.  I feel like I jumped right into reading about strangers that I hadn't developed a relationship with and wasn't really sure where they were coming from.
B001KMB6X2|5.0|Daring and exciting as Vin Diesel can be with terrific co-stars in this science fiction movie as a mercenary helping a beautiful woman in distress,I'd say more but it might spoil this great show no I will let you decide, there's full on action suspense and thrills by the minute. Not knowing whats next is marvellous. The story is fabulous and entertaining cunning and wait for it clever. Entertainment at it's best so gather the popcorn sit relax and enjoy with friends, I rated this an A grade plus you wont be disappointed.

B004KPLZKA|5.0|This CD is amazing! I got it in barely anytime at all and it was shipped all the way from the UK! Cher Lloyd is great!
B004FYH2MQ|4.0|This was a very easy going movie and done with very good taste. It was funny in just the right amounts. Just like the old days where we of the middle age generation considered a well made movie.<br />Two thumbs up!
B004TSXUWY|3.0|An interesting topic but the characters are not realistic, however if you can suspend belief, it is an easy and enjoyable read. It generated enough discussion at book club to make it a good book club choice.
0345803493|5.0|After reading the first book, I was hooked. Had to get the \\"Darker\\" and \\"freed\\" books and I had to get them fast. The story was old fashion and seductive (sex,prince charming,good guy wins), which is something most women have always dreamed of.Super fun read.
0380807343|4.0|I'd say age 10 and up, maybe 8 if the child is an avid reader. My daughter read it when she was 9 and really loved it. I just read it myself, and I think it is well-written indeed.<br /><br />Coraline has moved into a new house with her parents. It doesn't take long for Coraline to sense something odd is going on. When she opens a locked door in the parlor, she goes into another world, a weirdly parallel house. I didn't start getting really creeped out until her parents are trapped in a mirror.<br /><br />Neil Gaiman's descriptive powers are awesome. At one point, Coraline is locked in a closet behind a mirror in the parallel house. She is not alone in the closet, but her fellow prisoners are like the husks of children. \\"The pale figures pulsed faintly; she could imagine that they were nothing more than afterimages, like the glow left by a bright light in your eyes after the lights go out.\\"<br /><br />Or how about when Coraline tries to strike a wager with the Other Mother in the parallel world:<br />\\" 'I swear it,' said the other mother. 'I swear it on my own mother's grave.'<br />'Does she have a grave?' asked Coraline.<br />'Oh yes,' said the other mother. 'I put her in there myself. And when I found her trying to crawl out, I put her back.' \\"<br /><br />This short book is written with great imagination. The language is fairly simple, but not dumbed down. The sinister atmosphere is great. And the little heroine is believably strong.<br /><br />Recommended reading. I'm getting a couple for gifts.<br /><br />Happy Reader

B004SBX112|5.0|This version of Angry Birds is just as great and challenging as the others.  I sometimes have to set a timer, so I don't play for hours.
B005LAIHPY|2.0|Ok. Honest review. I'll give credit where it's due. The movie looks great. Special effects wise. The acting is plausible at best. However, the movie has no focus, no real story and felt incomplete. I got bored halfway through. I've seen thousands of movies and many action, alien, alien invader movies. Not all of them are good, not all bad. Great special effects are a dime a dozen nowadays. I expect an at least plausible story. This movie doesn't explain anything about the aliens' purpose. They came to destroy the earth?  Not evident here. They just 'crash' on earth. Then an irritating lead Navy character does something stupid, as they have him do from film's beginning, and then fighting begins. And I notice the battles are instigated mostly by humans. Ok. Give me a reason to root for the good guys. I mean, the aliens even scan humans and refuse to kill them. What exactly is going on? Once again not explained. It almost seemed like the aliens here are accidental bad guys. There's a point in the movie that a guy says that we're facing an extinction level event. What event exactly? They still don't explain it. Did the writers say to themselves that, to the audience, aliens automatically equal bad guys we have to destroy? No explanation needed? Ah no. Independence Day,  Predator, War of the Worlds, Alien, Close Encounters, E.T., Transformers. All alien stories. All with a clear purpose and determination of good or bad and motive. No such thing in this. I wasn't even invested in the human characters. The only one wad the main lead who was an irresponsible idiot that was made into a paper hero. I never got a sense that he became a better man. This was just a loud special effect advertisement for the Navy. Glad I did not pay to see this at the theater.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The book had a Good start - slow middle - typical feel good fantasy - good ending. I read the trilogy and the persuading of a friend. I'm glad I did. Waiting for the movie and I hope it stands up.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|For the price and entertainment value of this series it was a real steal to get this season set at this time and one of the two best seasons yet to come out of this hilarious series.  What also makes this series so enjoyable to watch is the obvious chemistry that connects the cast to one another as you can see how well they work with each other and the fund they have doing this show.The shows enjoyment also has the bonus of showing people the pros and cons of the intelligent but socially awkward group of men though you get to see them coming out of this shell through the help of each other and their socially experienced but less intelligent female friend and on/off girlfriend of one them.  The video quality is great as well as the audio and the added bonus of not having to wait through commercials is a big bonus.  So for fans of hilarious sci-fi series or series like Friends or How I Meet Your Mother here's another great series to add to your dvd t.v. show collection.
B0053O89K6|5.0|great purchase, 5 discs it's ok just the same as the two other seasons on bd I highly recommend it

B000FC146C|5.0|The Thorn Birds was published before there was an \\"Oprah's Book Club\\" that would launch books and make immediate best sellers.  The Thorn Birds took the reading world over all on its own.  Once you start reading, you can't stop.  I retread this saga about the Cleary family at least every year then my copy of the book fell apart.  I will enjoy reading this book after a very long absence.  While this review does not give much if anything to say about the book, consider this.  How many books do you remember after 30 years?  How many books did you read so many times that the covers fell off?  That is a good book!

B0090EHVMC|3.0|I was really excited to watch The Lorax movie with my 2 year-old daughter in hopes it would be as special and timeless as Dr. Seuss' book, The Lorax.... unfortunately, it wasn't.<br /><br />The animation was good and the story line ok - it was somewhat based on the book after all. However, I personally did not care for the cheesy style of comedy in comparison to other Dr. Seus movies (e.g. Horton Hears a Who - silly but not cheesy). It just wasn't funny to me.  Maybe kids will \\"get it\\", but I didn't.<br /><br />My last critique focuses on the casting. No offense to Danny DeVito - he is a great actor and comedian and I enjoy his characters in other shows and films - but I never, in all my years of reading the Lorax, imagined Danny DeVito's voice as the Lorax.  It just sounds wrong.  I struggled with this the entire film.<br /><br />Overall, the movie was OK. Not great.  It had a lot to live up to and no doubt fell short. I defnitely won't be purchasing this one, but it was entertaining enough as a one-time rental.
B001NU4CDM|5.0|This is the only album Styx recorded that I have to have..  Love every song but the soaring Castle Walls is my very favorite..  Coming in a close second is the hopeful Man in the Wilderness..  Every instrument is alive and beautiful as are the voices..  Early in 1984 when the album was released and I heard it, this music has been a part of my life..  Styx has many individual songs that I appreciate but no other album comes close to The Grand Illusion..

030758836X|1.0|I was enjoying the book well enough until the last pages.  I was and remain horrified at the ending.  It changes how you view Nick, a character we were supposed to have at least some sympathy for.  But then he allows a sociopath, Amy, to \\"win.\\"  I'll use the word win so as not to reveal the ending if you are still enticed to read the book.<br /><br />The start of the book was iintruguing.  Anyone who thinks this is a murder mystery wasn't paying attention to what they were reading.  It was clear Amy disappeared on her own.  I was intrigued to find out why and entertained when the reveal came.  And then the ending.<br /><br />Nothing good to be taken from this book.
B007X15GRQ|1.0|Poor character development, unrealistic, and overdone plot. A waste of time. The preview did not reflect the reality of the movie....misleading.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|A challenging but fun game. I really like the 10x10 and larger games. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes a challenge
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I couldn't stop reading it. It's an amazing book and gives you more of a realization of the sacrifice that our soldiers make. If you love the military, or just a general good read this is the book for you.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great book.<br /><br />Thank you for your service and thank you for giving us a peel into your world......Every American needs to read this and understand what our brave men do for our freedoms.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I was skeptical about this app but gave it a chance because it was free and saw so many good reviews. I can't sleep without it now.
B006XF5BTG|3.0|Ok, but as in many otter books it's about the writers own experience and believes.<br />I like statements to be scientific supported..
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I bought this for my girlfriend to play on her new asus tablet, we have started competing for high score. First time I have done that since I was 12 and hanging out in arcades.<br />(For you youngen's an arcade is a place you used to go to play video games with more than 8pixels)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|While I loved the first book, and the 2nd book was excellent, the 3rd book was by far the best in the series!
B007VGXS8M|5.0|Why all the bad reviews?  My 6 year old loves this game!  I do agree that it should be free though.  Otherwise...great game!
B009AJD5E0|5.0|It was well thought out and made you think. The acting was great and the story line was spectacular! MUST SEE if you liked any of the Alien series (and even if you didn't!)
0312430000|5.0|I found this book to be an easy read with some practical uses, and it was entertaining. David Lee Roth had a checklist? You have to read about Van Halen and Roth's M&M test.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|Best looking big fish game yet. A little monotonous, with going back and forth hundreds of times. But still worth 2 bucks.
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|Shrek kart is a lot better and the controls are easier in shrek kart. The graphics sick in pac man kart
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Lone Survivor is a phenomenal account of Operation Redwing. The book gives you a first hand account of the mental and physical preparedness of the Navy Seals. It takes you inside their demanding training phases and the step by step account of Operation Redwing.  Their extreme bravery in the face of overwhelming odds never defeats their fighting spirits or conviction to their mission. They unselfishly serve their country and the loyalty to their unique \\"brotherhood\\" and unwavering patriotism leaves you in awe of these great Warriors. Thank you Marcus for your service....and thank you to all who unselfishly serve...as did both my parents.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I' m glad this seal wrote this book. I believe every word of it and I hope a lot of people read it.  Our current leadership tends to twist the truth quite a bit and the media is just as bad. Let the truth be told! BEW
B008MG1E4A|5.0|this is a great book, i read it and didnt see anything that would compromise and security... that a bunch of bs... this guy is an American hero.. just like his teammates... he is very humble and he makes me proud to be an American.. thank you \\"mr.owen\\"...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game was amazing ! I love trying all the new games and unlocking new ones with the coins that I make from playing the ones I'm good at(:
B00846REIS|5.0|While Christian and Ana were a compelling couple to read about, Bared to You felt like a real relationship. All the real hang-ups that seriously damaged people could potential encounter as well as the real connections with other characters in the book. Over all an amazing read! Can't wait for the next book...
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|I saw this film opening weekend in 4K projection. It was absolutely stunning to behold. The level of detail in the volcanic eruption and the sand picture were astronomical and I could have watched those scenes for hours. Same goes for the city time-lapse city scenes.<br /><br />I saw this film and then went home and purchased Baraka on Blu-Ray. I have recently watched it and I believe that Baraka captured some more profound and amazing scenes than Samsara did. Both amazing in their own rights but I think Baraka was a bit more impactful. Samsara was definitely a technological wonder though, and I cannot wait for the 8K mastered Blu-ray. Gonna be a top disc in my collection and should be in yours as well.
B006LSZECO|2.0|It was a bit confusing as the story went back and forth between the present and the past, and it ended abruptly with no clear sense of satisfaction for either the characters or the reader.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|There are few shows on TV today that will keep you at the edge of your seat.  This is certainly one of them. It is incredibly well written and well acted. It is a psychological thriller with a strong human dimension. My wife and I couldn't wait for it to be released on Amazon Prime, and once we got it, we watched the whole season over a weekend. I would highly recommend it.
B008MG1E4A|1.0|It was \\"interesting\\" to get a bit more insight into the end of UBL but as the author explains this information is \\"available\\" from other sources.  As far as SEAL books are concerned there are much more insightful alternatives.  That being said I have nothing but admiration and respect for the armed forces in general and Seal's specifically.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|works great. I use it often. for every thing.  Even let the students use it. love the large display. love love love it
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is really fun and really cool but there is no point to it.would make it a little more intresting
B005K17RU0|3.0|Probably the best way to determine how good an app is would be by how often you use it. Well, I rarely use this, preferring the Weather Channel app. Why? I don't know, maybe its bland appearance, or the multiple steps to navigate thru the app.... just doesn't grab me.
030758836X|4.0|We get right into the action when Amy Dunne disappears from her Carthage, MO home on her 5th wedding anniversary.  The suspicious circumstances of her disappearance lead the police to believe that she's been forcibly abducted or, even worse, murdered by her husband, Nick.  It's all a terrible surprise to Nick who professes his innocence to the police, his twin sister, Margo, and Amy's parents.  But Nick's not entirely blameless because he's been carrying on a yearlong affair with a much younger woman, a student at the college where he teaches.<br /> The plot carefully unfolds, showing that Amy is alive and fabricated her own little drama to punish Nick for all his real and imagined transgressions.  It all goes awry when Amy's money is stolen and she's forced to seek shelter with an old flame in St. Louis who hides her in his well-appointed lake house.  Amy soon finds that she's a prisoner and has to dispose of her romantic jailer in order to complete her fiendish plan and return to Nick in Carthage.<br /> Ms. Flynn has done a great job in writing this fascinating tale.  It's definitely a \\"page turner\\" because surprises pop up in each chapter.  Unfortunately for me, I was not able to find a single character in the book that I liked and could root for.  The other problem I had was the ending.  It didn't ring true that a man would want to stay married to the devil incarnate just because she made herself pregnant (without knowledge or enjoyment on his part) and now carries his son.  I certainly wouldn't.  I'd want to get the hell away from her as fast as possible.
B00006EXDM|5.0|I've had the older version of Hot Rocks 1964 -1971 for many years and debated about buying the newer remastered version. When I first started to play the new remastered version on my floor standing JBL speakers I was shocked at the difference between the original version and the new remastered version of the early Stones songs. It was as if the band was playing right in my family room. I grew up in my teens buying and following the Rolling Stones and have most of their work old and new. Anybody who loves the early work of this group will not be disappointed once you hear this CD. I'm now going to replace my old version of More Hot Rocks with the newer remastered version.
B00866H7SS|5.0|I had read Fifty Shades and was really after something else to fill the gap. I was not disappointed. such a great read. I can't wait for the next book..
B006LSZECO|3.0|Thought it was very good for 70% of book but did not like ending. Felt the writing became too convulted and unbelievable. Disappointed in the ending.
B004GYY714|5.0|Makes it simple to tune into whatever your listening preference. Easy to understand and easy to use. Very useful app.
B008WHTFL8|5.0|When the band broke up several years ago, I was really disappointed because they had quickly become one of my favorite modern bands.  About a year ago, I heard that they were going to be working on a new album. Needless to say, I was thrilled.  My only fear was that the new album would fail to meet my high expectations, but they didn't disappoint.  It sounds better every time I listen to it.  A great buy!
B007U4DIM6|5.0|This in my opinion, is the best of the movies.  The whold family was highly supportive of it and they do not want to stop watching it.  My 9 year old grand daughter sat in front of our Big Screen TV watching it until she finally collapsed into a deep sleep at around 11:30 p.m.  Congrats on a great entertainment value.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This book stirred a little controversy.  I like to read and make up my own mind. I didn't read about any tactics or weaponry that would compromise our current troops. I was quite surprised at how well the book was written. I suspect a \\"ghost writer and/or great editor.  The facts if they are factual are interesting but the book really reveals the personality of the writer, which it should being a first hand account. I am glad our country has people capable and willing to serve but this fellow seems to glorify combat.  The dates and scenarios the author presents make it possible to guess the true identities of other personnel especially by friends and family. Other \\"Seals\\" may want their operations to remain secret. If accurate, at least it is a historical record.
B001L2EE9Y|5.0|Joni Mitchell at her finest.  This classic album encompasses the blisses and burdens of falling in love in the most beautiful, timeless way.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  It is very well written.  Lots of twists, turns and unexpected events.  Kept me on the edge of my seat!
B0047WJ12K|5.0|Leonardo di Caprio was excellent in this thinkers movie... he captured the crux of the writers imagination; this movie is really great, as all the secrets about psychology and psychics are revealed visually and in conversation... i am glad i bought it and will see it again.... takaluksee mmgr
B0087HT36U|5.0|This game is very entertaining with awesome graphics.  The characters are amusing. Just a thought...having the ability to select the right weapon for the particular level would be a bit more challenging, however,  either way I'm addicted!
0307341577|2.0|I was so excited to read this book, it was good in the first 50 pages and then i lost interest to continue. its a boring grim tale of murder. I will try the other two books of this author, maybe it might get better but i will have to read them to find out. She has potential as a writer but then again who knows...maybe not.
B003B02O0U|5.0|This is something 10+ years ago I would have believed to be fiction.  In today's world, it is probably more reality than fiction to some degree.  Gives one a lot of food for thought.
B003XYE7R2|5.0|The story catches the readers interest immediately and holds it through the entire book. I found reading it on an ebook to be easy and convenient and Amazons price is can't be beat.
B001VDJ5PG|5.0|My son was struggling with the end of a relationship and I kept referring to \\"When Harry Met Sally.\\"  He had no idea what I was talking about, but I told him it really fit their situation in some respects.  I had checked the local stores and had no luck -- not even in the big $5 dump bins.  I searched on the internet and Amazon had it and then I found the bonus set.  \\"Say Anything\\" and \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\" are two movies on my favorites list.  The price -- even with shipping -- made it an easy decision to add to my limited collection.  Now, I just need my son to sit down and watch it with me.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The most shocking thing about this book is how tame it is.  I've read children's books that shocked me more.  Apart from the fact that this book is utterly without literary merit, the story is banal and boring.  The best thing about this book is the hype surrounding it.  Read the reviews, they're (mostly) better written.  I actually gave up reading when I got through the first third of the second book.  Life is simply too short to wade through this silly tome.  Awfully happy for the author that she made a ton of money though.  Good for her.
B008XG1X18|5.0|My husband told me to stop pinning and come to bed.  I read ONE more someecard and he hit the roof.  Threw me out on the street!  I managed to sneak my Kindle out during the whole fracas.  I sleep under a giant bush that is close to the window with a router.  I just pin all day long from under the bush.
B0037BB00I|5.0|10 stars. MUST BUY!!!! !!! !!!! !!!! !!!!! !!!! !!!!! !!!!! !!!!! !!!!! !!!!! !!!!!! !!!!!! !!!!! !!! !!!!! !
034580404X|5.0|I think fifty shades of grey is wonderful and very indepth. you must commit to the whole trilogy. its a roller coaster ride in emotions. some people might find the titalation by the sex and uncomfortable by the bondage, not to mention hating the male lead. its smoke and mirrors. this is a multilevel book about the darkness in damage people. the story is powerful. how a couple find there way to each other by healing unconditionally. like the book says fifty shades of freed.  its a ride! I love it! the author is  miraculous and soulful. such a glimmer into the understanding of damaged people and there darkness. the book reads like butter, real smooth. if it dosent send you to therapy. fifty shades is a discussion book. five star read, enjoy!  amazon got this product to me in mint condition, thank you amazon.  alexis
B001CDZZI6|3.0|While somewhat interesting, it just supported what I already knew. So, for me, a big disappointment. With all of the hype, I was looking for something new, something enlightening and something to further my career or personal life. Perhaps, it will be more helpful to others.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Although I have not finished reading this excellent kindle book, I have found it to be an amazing guide for preparing my book for Kindle on Amazon, so thankyou very much for this valuable information and I thoroughly recommend this book to everyone who plans on preparing and building their book for Kindle.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|I didnt think that this was one of his best, You get bogged down some what with all the technical jagon so at times  the plot got some what lost. As a female fan I find this at times abit over the top, but must also admit that this is his style.But I wont be put off and will still be waiting for his next novel.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|Its amazing!! If you are a collector or a walking dead fan, this is a must have!! Go buy it now before there gone!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It's probably more functional than the regular calculator on a cell phone, and if you're on a Kindle without a calculator, it gets the job done. Nothing fancy, but nice that it saves your last entry.
B005LAII0I|5.0|I just adore this movie.  If you like silly, funny, lighthearted entertainment, this is a good choice.  The costumes and sets are gorgeous and the characters are varied and funny.  Julia Roberts is adorable and perfect for the part and the dwarves are far removed from the Disney model and good campy fun.
B008578H9G|5.0|This was a great ending for a great series. House and Wilson show the audience the true essence and meaning of friendship.
B0080TBS40|5.0|great new album from Chris Robinson and it does not disappoint. lots of great improv and jammming, captured on vinyl after road testing the songs all last year.
1401309666|5.0|Selling less of more is the new normal in the retail work. This is an important book presenting intriguing information for thinking marketeers. Well done.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|A WASTE OF MY MONEY AND TIME. I BELIEVE THE WRITER WROTE THIS BOOK FROM EXPERIENCE.<br />ANY ONE WRITING A BOOK LIKE THIS WOULD HAVE TO HAVE BEEN THERE.
0525953728|5.0|The story of a man who wanted to be a Seal from an early age and the trials and triumphs of his work. A well paced story with a good insight into the inner strengths of these special people.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love playing this game when I am in the mood for something simple. Lots of fun when I just feel like kicking back.
B00846REIS|2.0|This was recommended for people who had read Fifty Shades.  It wasn't as good in any way. I didn't care about the characters and wanted to stop reading it but slogged on to see if it got any better.  It didn't.
B007HU4FZ2|5.0|Without doubt, the best Christian-themed movie of my 50+ years attending movies.  Historically accurate script and masterful cinematography combine to tell the well-known story of Christ's passion without glossing over or romanticizing this ultimate act of God's grace.  The film is graphic in it's very accurate portrayal of first century crucifixions and, as such portrays the depth of Christ's love in the sacrifice of Himself for all mankind.
B007SGM084|5.0|An excellent trilogy. Not for the faint of heart or the traditional romance fan, 50 Shades is very erotic and raw, an emotional rollercoaster of driven self-loathing and healing love.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|I have read every Jack Reacher book and like so many other trusting Lee<br />Child fans, pre-ordered this one for my Kindle.  It was so boring, so tedious and so absolutely preposterous in its premise and in its development.  What's happened to you, Lee Child?  I and millions of others have already been let down by the thought of Tom Cruise playing this wonderfully tall and almost super-human character.  What's up?  Please -- if there's another Reacher novel I hope he gets to Virginia, finds his lady, marries her and hangs up his guns and his fists.
B001LM1456|3.0|While this is not the best of the 'Avengers' series it's still better then a LOT of junk out there right now.  It's worth the $3 but if you miss it you shouldn't feel bad either.  Not bad to pass the time on a rainy afternoon or night when you just need to chill and nothing is on TV.
B0087HT36U|3.0|Great time. Kept me and grand kids busy for hours.<br />Would like to have additional levels other then the three.
B0006GAOCW|5.0|I absolutely love this coming of age film that is a fictitious look at what could happen if the president's daughter went to college.  It's also a very touching love story.  To start I have to say that I had a very hard time finding this film!  I had seen a preview a long time ago, but didn't see it in the theatre.  Finally through multiple searches (um...President's daughter...er...no) it came up.  I rented it on i-tunes and then loved it so much I bought the dvd.  This has got to be one of the most under-rated films in this genre and I wonder why when it's so well done!  I have read that it had many negative reviews, but keeping things in perspective, most movies of this genre are marked down by critics. Most of these well meaning people are males over 40 years of age who can't really understand why the film doesn't appeal to them (lol).  As someone who is a fan of this type of film, I have to say that it's one of the best in my collection and is comparable to movies such as \\"The Princess Diaries\\" and \\"What a Girl Wants\\".  It also has a great balance between touching moments, both happy and sad, and humour too.  It's one of my favourite love stories and is really enjoyable which is why I gave it 5 stars.  There is very little potentially offensive material which includes the odd mild swear and one quiet use of Christ's name, mention of birth control, and one incident of over-drinking as a minor.  I also enjoyed the effective use of music such as Sinatra's \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\" which added to the emotional intensity of many scenes.<br /><br />Samantha is the president's daughter and goes to Redmond College (thrilled that my Mom went there too).  In a gentle exaggeration of what could happen and what we hope the real president wouldn't do, she goes with a full security team and secret service agents.  This really hampers her ability to have any chance of enjoying the college experience.  Sam meets James who is in one of her classes and the two quickly bond.  Finally Sam is able to be herself, and as they fall in love, she enjoys some freedom and independence.  The romantic chemistry between Sam (Katie Holmes) and James (Marc Blucas) is just outstanding and they are a very stunning couple. This film showcases Katie Holmes' beauty and good acting ability, and in fact the whole film is very well acted.  At first I wasn't wild about how the president is portrayed, mostly because the president is a bit a jerk at times in how he relates to his daughter and seems to put his political aspirations above his daughter's happiness.  At times I imagined how it would be if Colin Firth was playing the role, but I guess he's not qualified with the British accent, haha.<br /><br />This film also highlights the problems that famous people face with being hounded by the paparazzi.  In the film Samantha mentions that the only time she had privacy was in utero.  This reminded me of the famous quote by Queen Elizabeth's favourite governess Marilyn Crawford, who said \\"Royals are only private in the womb.\\"  Such a sad commentary about what has happened to many of our celebrities today!<br /><br />My only disappointment is that it does have a bit of a bitter-sweet ending and that it was sort of a set up for sequel that never happened. I would have loved to see the continuing story!  All I know is that it's one dvd that I will watch over and over again, and I hope someday the producers will realize they do have a very good product and come out with a blu-ray version.nally Sam is able to be herself, and as they fall in love, she enjoys some freedom and independence.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book was more interesting than the 2nd 50 shades darker.  This book is a romance, but with a lot of twists.  I think the 2nd was repetitive.  I haven't read the 3rd book yet.

This album is just so emotional, so real.<br /><br />It has instantly joined my top albums of all time.  I can't help but sing along. At times I want to cry; other times, I feel a strength I don't think I could bear on my own. I can't stop listening to it.<br /><br />Thank you, Glen.
0345522478|5.0|Hey, I liked this!  Urban fantasy written by a guy in the 21st century, who would have thought?<br /><br />Druids, Werewolves and Witches, oh my!  And the Druid is a shapeshifter.  The character development is excellent and the writing style is good.<br /><br />Note that this is the first book in a series of books entitled The Iron Druid Chronicles.  I have ordered the other 4 books.

B0038BBA4I|5.0|What can I say about this album? It is everything I have been looking for in music.<br />Sigh No More, is SUCH a wonderful album and honestly, it is all I have been listening to for the past 3 weeks.<br />I found Mumford and Sons through a music station, which played their song 'Awake My Soul'. It caught me off guard, I connected with the lyrics and found myself hurrying to Amazon for their album. One click is all it took to hear this amazing band.<br />Their music is intense for me because of how their lyrics are raw and passionate. The singers voice has a way of making you feel exactly how he feels and the music matches perfectly, it's indescribable. It is an album that can be played through all the songs without skipping. It carries a certain feeling throughout that you just want to keep listening.<br />The best thing about this album, this band, and the lyrics is that it has a way of making you feel multiple emotions, if not all, at once. In the song 'Little Lion Man', it makes you feel awake/'alive', angry, sad, everything. Their lyrics, for me, get me thinking, and connecting my thoughts with emotions.<br /><br />Besides the emotional intensity, which might not be there for some, or just not what everyone is looking for, it's a good album just to listen to, I would definitely recommend Sigh No More!
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|Shinedown has surpassed my expectations. This is an amazing cd. Each time I listen I love it more. The reinvention of Shinedown with each new cd makes me believe Shinedown will never be static like other bands who reach the top. To quote Shinedown \\"DON'T BE DELICATE, BE VAST AND BRILLIANT\\" Amaryllis is both!

In Wool Hugh Howey was gone the opposite way instead focusing on a very small confined world set in what feels like a post apocalyptic world. So as a result I feel there was a much greater focus on character and detail.<br /><br />There are several main character POV that stretch over the five short stories. Each main character is well thought out, and interesting. Hugh Howey does a good job of creating characters that you can sympathize with. He does a great job of detailing their thoughts, and motives so you really feel like you understand them.<br /><br />The story flows nicely, and you never feel like you're being overburdened with information. Howey has great pacing, and the details while sometimes excessive create a world that does feel bigger than the characters, and as a result really create a desire for answers. As the reader I felt just as curious for answers as our main characters, and shared the same desire for more information. Now, we don't necessary get all the answers, but I think Howey gives us just the right amount. After all nobody in this world could have all the answers, and I think its fitting that we don't know more than the characters who we're looking through.<br /><br />I'd also like to commented that for a self published book these were extremely well done. You'd think a professional editor went over it. I also didn't experience any formatting issues with my kindle version.<br /><br />Overall I can't recommend Wool enough for any fan of Sci-fi, or anyone who really loves character driven stories. It's a quick read, and will leave you wanting more, but in a satisfying way.

B008CLI4N4|4.0|I think the series was faithful in bringing the book to life. I am currently reading the books. Now when I read the books, I can better visualize the vastness and characters.<br /><br />The story is so intricate, that it would have taken several seasons to capture every detail that was in just book one. Season one condensed it to just the one season. While I understand and am aware that it is a bloody story, I do think that some of the blood was overdone. During the joust scene someone was was stabbed in the throat.  I do not have a problem seeing it happen, but to keep the camera focused on the pumping blood seemed a bit gratuitous.<br /><br />Some of the sex scenes were slightly gratuitous. I would have enjoyed watching this with my teenage son if it were not for the graphic sex/nudity. I try to not be a prude, but I cannot watch soft porn with my teenager. It is just too uncomfortable for both of us.

B0024F08RO|3.0|The first season was a lot of fun.  Well, aside from the main character having one emotion and one expression 99% of the time, which continues throughout the series.  This season had the feel of Alias or another conspiracy spy show.  It fit more with season 2 in some respects, and stood apart from 1 and 3.  The series continues to require some serious suspension of disbelief, along the same lines as believing a prison would allow a death row inmate virtually unsupervised work duty.  Towards the end the conspiracy becomes murky and there seems to be action just for the sake of action, similiar to Alias.  Also they kill off/get rid of a lot of people... and while I appreciate that they don't make everyone bullet proof, sometimes it feels like they are just killing people for the sake of killing people.  Which is cemented by how the show ends.<br /><br />Spoilers<br /><br />I wasn't happy with the character development, especially regarding Sarah and Michael.  The first and beginning of the second season there was some chemistry, but the writers basically allowed that to be neglected, for one reason or another.  Apparently at some point they have sex, despite hardly ever touching, talking, or kissing on camera.  Since they run the plot around in circles for several episodes it feels akward that the writers didn't make room for a few minutes every couple of episodes for them being even slightly intimate beyond Michael looking really akward when making a joke.  Maybe the actors couldn't pull it off?  That alone knocked off one star for me, otherwise this would be solidly 4 stars.

B00009NH5W|5.0|During the late 1990's Terence Trent D'Arby's comparisons with Prince spilled over all too obviously into his personal life. After a series of dreams D'Arby adopted the new name Sananda Maitreya proclaiming after the turn of the millenium that \\"Terence Trent D'Arby was dead\\". So there was complete and utter Prince copy cat-isms,except a name change one could pronounce. Still the talent was there all the same. In the late 90's he'd recorded an album called 'Solar Return' that apparently did not please Columbia. So he left with his publishing to form his own record label and during 2003 finaly released the album under this name. And interestingly enough using the Terence Trent D'Arby name for the title,but his Sananda name for production credits. Point of his identity taking,it was a venture that was creatively worth everyone's time.<br /><br />  Right off the bat \\"O Divina\\" ,with it's horn fueled late 60's catchy soul/pop flavor had instant hit potential without being the least bit bubble gum. From there he goes into \\"Designated Fool\\" with a bass/guitar riff right out of Rufus & Chaka's \\"Piece Of My Heart\\";unknown if it's played or sampled. Some songs such as \\"My Dark Places\\",\\"The Inner Scream\\" and \\"Drivin' Me Crazy\\" grasp upbeat melodies onto dragging,mildly depressing trip hoppy type rhythms which...have to face it is a bit of a late 90's cliche. But it makes it's point especially as the album goes on. \\"Shalom\\" is a wonderfully fluid,Fender electric piano soaked acid jazz number and my personal favorite here. And after that there's this wonderful nine song cycle from \\"Girl\\" through the closing \\"Shadows\\"-all of which are almost like a hit parade that never was of some of the most captivating rock/soul rhythms and melodic hooks I've heard it awhile.<br /><br />  Again that Prince-like eccentricity about Terence Trent/Sananda's personality,as well as the lack of major label support,made this album a rather hard sell. And in fact I discovered it on a CD rack brand new in a dollar store only a month after it was released. This is a record that revels in a great deal of pop songcraft and makes the point also that he was finally able to fuse his lofty musical ambitions into songs that were compact and had a lot of commercial potential. In a lot of ways,it's something of an indirect follow up to [[ASIN:B000002937 Symphony Or Damn]]' even though so many years and another album come between it. Since this time he'd recorded only independently under the name Sananda Maitreya,and Terence Trent D'Arby remains a completely non entity musically. With this album,coming as late and abruptly as it did anyway,there's still the sense D'Arby would be more than welcomed if he were to return.in a dollar store only a month after it was released.

B000NY12CI|4.0|Infidel is a very moving story about having the willpower and drive to not settle for \\"the way things are\\".  Growing up in a culture that degredates and tortures women in the name of Allah, Ayaan tells her story of great courage.  I felt that the first half of the book was fast paced and easy to read, but the second half got somewhat bogged down in too much detail about her day to day life and constant movements.  I enjoyed the book and would recommend it as an eye opener to a very different world that sadly exists in the Muslim community.

B003L77G06|5.0|Completely charming, this comedy has to be one of the best shows on TV.  The characters are well developed, and getting to know each of them better is a pleasure.  Not only are family dynamics explored, it is done in such a humerous way that I kept myself laughing night and day because I purchased the complete Season 1 and Season 2 on DVD.  I couldn't turn off my DVD player.  The program is very good at showing people as people rather than labels and at helping dispel prejudices.  Recommend for the whole family. Can't wait until Season 3!
B00024I2Z4|4.0|I LOVE that this portrays a strong female character and also another belief system (as did Pocahontas), but do not like the dressing up and behaving a certain way to  \\"be marriageable.\\" The only saving grace for that aspect is that the great warrior seeks Mulan out (as marriageable), knowing she is nothing like those \\"traditional\\" women the match-maker is readying for marriage. I also think the character of the little dragon who earns his way back into an honored place amongst the honored ancestors is a great character and a good lesson about quick thinking, perseverance, and determination. I like this movie and I'm glad my 4 year old granddaughter loves it, even if she's moved on to Peter Pan after watching this one more times than I can count. There are not enough videos for children with strong female characters.
630471193X|5.0|Simply said:  This is a wonderful movie, full of heroism by John Travolta.  It is inspirational to watch John Travota's character, despite opposition from everyone he does and doesn't know, forge ahead when he suddenly receives supernatural powers on his birthday.  And all he wants to do with his powers is help the world around him.  A must-see for the whole family.
B0007KTBIU|4.0|This video is very beautiful and not the slightest bit realistic. If you totally ignore history, and I LOVE history; there is incredible music and animation that make this video worth watching. I like that there is a strong woman role model even if she is strong for a man she loves. At four, my granddaughter is less interested in this one, so there is no reason to explain the discrepancies between reality and history or between actual Native Americans and the ones portrayed in this video, though the time will come. It is worth watching for its beauty. It is not part of my youth, so I have no comparison as to how the message touched me then and now.

B000JBWWRY|4.0|My granddaughter watches Peter Pan a dozen times a day. She's not yet four, but loves fairies. The pixie dust that makes the pirate ship fly in the end is very exciting to her. Though her parents are very sensitive to racism and this story is filled with it around Native Americans, they do not feel it is obvious enough to effect their daughters. I loved Peter Pan as a child; I loved the idea of flying; I loved the lesson of being honorable, of admitting your mistakes and rectifying them; and the desire to never grow up and take on adult responsibilities. Still, the characters do return home (at least Wendy, John and Michael) and their father admits to believing the same story as a child, which I think is an important lesson for every child. We don't have to grow up and \\"give up\\" our dreams. Underlying everything else, I feel that message is clear, though I admit to hoping my granddaughter tires of this one soon so we can see something else amongst all the videos from my youth I have shared with her.
B004MYFUC8|5.0|It is one of my favourite books ever. I could read it over and over again.<br />I also watched the movie twice, but it doesn't give you the experience the book does.
B003H9M1Q2|3.0|I loved Dumbo as a child. I saw \\"over-coming\\" handicaps, dealing with teasing, motherly support, all positive things. My DIL is African American and she and my son have watched every movie I've given to their daughters before the girls can watch them. They are not allowed to watch Dumbo because it is blatantly racist, something someone with my white skin would not even notice. I've now watched it for my own education and still think the message is worth it. The kids agree, despite it also being \\"fat-ist\\" and a few other \\"isms\\" we didn't even notice when I was a child (60 years ago), and they will watch it with their girls when they are older and talk to them about what concerns them.<br /><br />I understand the concerns of my bi-racial family, but I'm glad they are open-minded enough to share this story with their children when they are older and can understand why they held back on this one (all the black men pounding in the stakes and the white men and women being stars, for example), as I feel the message of over-coming difficulties is an important one.

B006LSZECO|3.0|I don't typically read mysteries. That being said, I enjoyed this one. The story was interesting and moved along quickly. This was a good story to settle down with at the end the day. It was entertaining.I feel like the characters could have been fleshed out a bit more, though. It also felt a little like I was reading a screen play. Too many \\"scenes\\"... Overall, it was a decent escape.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|The author goes to great pains to give an accurate description of the lifestyle, training, and mindset of the elite forces dedicated to this country. He does so without compromising security or any attempts to call special attention to any of his cadre's accomplishments. This was a factual look into the actual operation without political spin. I found it very engrossing. I look forward to reading more from the author.

B007UPNA6Y|1.0|If Lee Child had left all the repetitive and minute descriptions of nothing out of this novel it would only be about 150 pages of somewhat disappointing action and dialogue. I 100% agree with the reviews by Reacher Creature and others. I think as RC's review said he has joined the ranks of the \\"also rans\\" like James Patterson, who I got fed up with about 15 years back and haven't read one of his books since.  Then to see that that little wimp Tom Cruise will play him in the movie, thats the end, will they have to give him 12 inch lifts in his shoes to carry this off or employ midgets to play all the supporting roles.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I loved the first book, liked the second book, and liked about 1/2 of this book. Many things were too unbelievable and ridiculous. I didn't care for the \\"twist\\" at the end or the explaination of what happened to Gale. I also felt that many important scenes that should've been written in detail were glossed over and others that seemed less significant were too long and drawn out. If you have read the first two books, you must read this one to see the story to its end, but be prepared for disappointment.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Very fun game when I get a chance to do it.  My kids play it all the time.  They love it.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I enjoyed this , it was entertaining and had plot and subplot . Maybe the charaters could have stood more fleshing out but in short a good movie about the human condition in extreme circumstances and how some of us can rise above and be heroes with out really meaning to do so .

B005HEX1AK|4.0|The premise and how it carries out in the plot are clever. I found there to be some intriguing twists in the story.<br /><br />Just why the crew proceeds into a temporal anomaly seems nonsensical. Nevertheless if one expected perfection, there wouldn't be many shows worth watching.<br /><br />I liked it.
B000RZIGVS|3.0|I think the review by Thomas Cannold covered it very well.<br /><br />In general, it's a great series, and I enjoyed watching it all the way through again.<br /><br />However... the packaging was done in an insanely cheap manner, and the MSRP seems to suggest that they think this should sell more for similar sized sets, that are packaged and delivered in a much better way. It is almost like they are saying to their fans \\"You are really worthless trash who's only purpose is to give us lots money for our scraps.\\"<br /><br />Honestly, at half the price I got it, or about 1/5th of the MSRP show on Amazon, it would probably be worth it.
B001HMSFFC|1.0|I don't know if this script was written by a man or a gay man, but it's got to be one of the two for the script to be this disconnected from women and the original series.  I will try to not put any spoilers in my review.<br /><br />First off I have to say that I loved the series and felt that the way it ended was superb.  I felt they ruined that superb ending with this movie.  The series is about 4 women who have been great friends for many years and support each other through the hard times and the good and share in each other's quest for love, security or pleasure (depending on the character).  In the movie this support for each other goes down the drain when one of the girls gets cheated on by her man.  She decides to separate from him... do the girls support her in her very sane decision to do this, like they would have in the series?  Nope.  They pretty much gang up on her for not allowing his \\"little mistake\\" and forgiving him.  And they do all act like it's a no big deal thing that should be swept under the rug and that she's being a drama queen for nothing.  From Samantha perhaps this would be acceptable because of her attitude towards monogamy, (though even she broke up with a man for cheating on her during the later seasons), but it is completely out of character for all the characters to do this to their \\"friend\\" not to mention completely unrealistic.  Especially since during the season something simular happened to the other characters and they were completely supported when THEY broke off their relationships due to this same reason.<br /><br />Another thing that was bad was the fashion.  The director tried too hard to make these girls look \\"fabulous\\" to the point where they were dressed completely out of character at times.  Miranda during the series never wore ultra bright colors and unprofessional attire because she is a lawyer and this attire would not suit her character.  In this movie it changes and suddenly she's walking down the street wearing colors that are too loud for her skin tone and going to work in clothing that is not appropriate for the office.  Even the other girls are sometimes too done up.  During the series the characters were fashion conscious, but it was natural looking rather than looking like they were TRYING.  It seems somebody put more attention on the fashion the girls were wearing rather than the actual script and movie.<br /><br />There are other points I could mention specifically about the script that I felt was lacking, but to save this review from being too long I'll just conclude here and say that this movie was a disappointment and really brings down a rare series that had great writing and good performances.

B000VS6P9Q|1.0|I'm Not There is an excellent movie with a wonderful sound track.  But this disk is not the sound track of the film.  It is by different artists that can't come close to what is in the movie.  Greatly disappointed.  Stay away from this disk if you are a fan of the film.  The second of the two disks has performances so anemic and deplorable that I had to force myself to finish it.  It does continue the irony of the film.  \\"I am not There\\"  does not show Dylan or mention his name, though the film is about him.  Most of the music in the film is performed by Dylan and he is given credit in the credits.  He is even \\"less there\\" on this disk.  He performs none of the music and very second or third rate performers attempt to sing his songs.

The themes of human nature, conditioning, xenophobia, and politics are timeless and his insights are invaluable. His foresight in understanding future technologies (even the iPad!) is remarkable. But ultimately it's the power of the story itself and the characters behind it that makes this one of my absolute favorite books. The sequels are also very good, but this is by far the best.

B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I totally blame my son for getting me into this series!  And so love watching it with him!  We had a marathon once Season 2 arrived at the house and watched both seasons back to back... and then dived into the extras.<br /><br />Regardless of what you think of Shane, Carl, Lori, Rick, Glen, Dale, Daryl, Andrea, Hershel, Maggie, or any of the other characters in this series, their struggle to survive is fascinating but what really catches my attention is the 'bratty' attitudes, backstabbing, and arguments amongst the survivors.  There are characters you'll love - and those you love to hate ... and it's led to many interesting discussions between my son and I (he's hating Andrea at the moment, and I personally want to drop kick Lori! - and we both love Dale and Daryl!)<br /><br />Most of Season 2 was fun to watch but nothing dramatic until the last couple of episodes - and believe me they ended the season with a show we watched several times just because it was so spectacular - and my son was fascinated by the chick at the end with the zombies on leashes.<br /><br />The makeup artists did an amazing job with all the costumes and makeup so the gore is perfect without being overwhelming and quite honestly it's sinfully fun to sit down and enjoy watching the episodes knowing that it's something I do not normally watch... in fact it's one of the few shows I do enjoy watching and look forward to each new episode.<br /><br />Onto the extras... Since we never watched the webisodes (slow internet and limited bandwith), we were captivated by them but the whole time I wondered how it played into the series - besides the zombies, fear and struggle to survive but then at the end we realized just how it fit - and then Cody decided we must watch both seasons all over again because he's sure there are other things he missed the first couple times - and I'll be right there watching it with him.<br /><br />On a more personal note however, my son hates to read but after watching the first season he was curious about the books so I bought him the entire series.  He's read them all and keeps pointing out the differences between the books and the series so he really appreciated the extra that explains why they changed the order some of the events happened.<br /><br />I'm so ready for Season 3 to start!

B000PSG48E|5.0|I had a coupon when I went to Mall of America on the first day that Automatic For The People was released on CD. A woman in Sam Goody asked me what I was there for. I told her I wanted the new R.E.M. CD. She took me right to the Limited Wood Box Edition. I did not see a price, but the coupon was probably only good for items that were selling for the full price. As I stood in line for the register, I was sure I would be paying full price less the amount of the coupon. I started feeling like a fool, but I could afford some luxury if it was not going to fall and break when I stepped on it like the plastic jewel case. I keep the CD in the box on a bookshelf, because it does not fit in my CD towers. The box and CD are still in great shape after many years of use. I love some of the songs. One of them starts:<br /><br />Monty, this seems strange to me<br /><br />and the music seems to be perfect for that kind of song. I probably needed to hear it while I was waiting for nightswimming, they cannot see me naked. Of all my purchases at Mall of America, buying books or music was easy and ordinary once I knew where the stores were. Andy, did you hear about this one? My collection of weirdnesses has some other memories of Mall of America.
1449305172|5.0|This is really the seminal work on the practical application of lean product development as it expands incisively on the theories presented in the works of Blank (Four Steps to the Epiphany) and Ries (The Lean Startup).  While its forebears are no doubt good reads and packed with useful (but more theoretical) information, this book is in itself a great starting point.  If you only have time to read one, read this -- and start cutting out waste immediately after.

B007IXWL2C|4.0|Great ... Realy romantic with kind of suspense. Kept my attention all the time. Maybe a dipper view on Christian behaviour could bring more expectation to the story.
B007RTAR64|3.0|I cannot review accurately because I do not open the package.<br />What I see I like.  Katniss seems accurately portrayed.
B004S7XR1U|2.0|I read this entire book chasing the promise of the really good story this could have been - it didn't even have a good ending when I got there after wading through page after page of tediousness punctuated by a bright  spot every now and then.  Disappointing.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|it was very good read it was nothing like the hunger games but mostly death i hate this book but i love dragonballz
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Outstanding book. I read it in one day with a short pause to eat dinner.  I could not put it down.
B008JFLWLE|5.0|The best math app ever. It works like magic. I'm really impressed. Now I can delete all my other calculator apps.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The story is so captivating, and there are twists and turns at every chapter. The ending is really disappointing, although I believe the author wants it that way to leave an open end for more stories.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|One of the few movies that enhanced the novel. Followed the story line and clarified what the author set forth in the novel. Great entertainment.
B008BO61BE|5.0|Wow! The US Festival concert footage made this purchase worth every penny! Rob in his prime hitting every note. Glen and KK are awesome...of course. This is a must have for every Priest fan.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Well written and refreshingly fresh in that it brings home the fact that you can be great without being perfect.. The write up is well balanced and realistic with no fancy frills... Really enjoyed it and has inspired me to adopt a new approach to life!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Enjoyed understanding the details of the mission and the individual military thought process and perspective. Several surprises in the psychology of military life and work.
0061703087|4.0|Michael Crichton is credited with many great books and movies.  'Andromeda Strain', 'The Terminal Man', 'Jurassic Park', 'The 13th Warrior': Formally known as 'Eaters of the Dead', just to name a few off the top of my head.<br /><br />This novel is quite good, although I do not believe it is his best.  This writing deals primarily with nano-technology or as many call it \\"tiny robots\\".  What I personally found really interesting was the computer programming that Mr. Crichton delves into.<br /><br />The main character Jack Forman is a software programmer and throughout the book talks quite a bit about \\"Pred-Prey\\" programs, and \\"distributive intelligence\\" in relation to computers.  What does all this mean?  Well, unfortunately Michael does not convey enough to the reader, (most of which, including me, are PC program laymans), what all these programs do in the real world we live in.  I know now from reading this book that these programs make nano-bots go crazy and attack humans, but I am sure this very real programs have real functions in real life.  I just don't know what that is, I would like to.  Supplimental research after reading this novel will be neccesary if you the reader want to truly grasp what was being talked about by most of the characters.<br /><br />In regard to the book, Mr. Crichton tries to convince us the reader that this is a very real situation that could happen in real life.  Frankly I didn't buy it.  I know nano-technology is getting worked on, but I think it's safe to say we are a good length of time away from flying clouds of man eating killer robots.<br /><br />I will not delve too much into the plot or story.  That would spoil the read.  If you are curious, Wikipedia has a decent summary of the book and I am sure there are Amazon reviewers who have gone in depth on this read.<br /><br />---Is it worth a read?---<br /><br />Yes, with conditions.  If you are a Crichton fan.  If you like science fiction.  Know that while 'Jurassic Park' has some science and possibility behind it, this novel doesn't sell itself on being real anytime soon.  Know there is A LOT of technical jargon thrown around by the characters and not explained enough.  Know that this novel doesn't really start to heat up until about half way through.<br /><br />Still with all this being said, it is a good read.<br /><br />I personally picked up my copy at my local Goodwill.  I found a hardback.  I still see hardbacks and paperbacks there on a regular basis.  So if this read interests you, go check out your local Goodwill or Salvation Army, I think your chances of finding this novel are quite high.<br /><br />In conclusion I will say this was a decent entry by the late author.  Michael Crichton was a man we all should aspire to be like.  A doctor, a writer, a world traveler.  Crichton was the real \\"most interesting man alive\\".  The world is a little darker without him.  We'll all miss your books and movie adaptations.  So long sir, you are missed.<br /><br />--References--<br /><br />1. 'Prey' by Michael Crichton.<br />2.

B008MG1E4A|4.0|I liked the book. I think it was written very well and gave a first hand look at what happened. I am more inclined to believe this book than the media reports and the government reports. Who is more knowledgeable about what happened than one who was actually there. I do not believe that the author would reveal any government \\"secrets\\" or jeopardize in any way any of his fellow SEALS or anyone who was involved in this operation. These men should be revered for what they did. I highly recommend this book.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I was very happy that I finally got to read this book, after all the hype I've read about it. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was due to the large amount of time spent on the Battle Games and the (seemingly) short amount of time spent with the actual war. Overall, I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is a fan of sci-fi.
B0035G0U2O|4.0|A good movie overall if you can just enjoy it for what it is.  Yes we all know they really can't do that with a car but so what. You watch for the action not the realism. So let go and pop some popcorn, forget about the bad day at work or the 164 things that need to be done and have a couple of hours of take me away time.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Highly recommend this calculator app!! I'm a finance guy and it works great. Large numbers are a plus. Jeff B.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I don't know where all the bad reviews are coming from.  I love this book.  Actually, I loved it so much that I immediately purchased book 2 and then book 3 all in less than a week.  I could not put it down.  I easily became lost and could not wait to get home from work to read more.  There are certainly \\"O M G\\" sections, but seriously, they make you want more.  BUY IT!
B00884GR0W|5.0|I cant get the app because my dad said I need to wait until my birthday to get it cuz I need to pay for it but from the reveiws I would probalbly give it 5 stars but I guess I have to wait......
B008MZU8R0|5.0|I've been a rush fan for many years and this album  has me stunned that these guys still have plenty of rocket sauce left in them. You get a well written and perfectly executed journey from the first track to the last. It's comparable to 2112 in that it tells a story and  gives you the full range of sound that Rush is capable of producing. You want be disappointed.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I loved the movie, Searching for Sugarman, about Rodriguez, the singer/writer of the songs on Cold Fact.  This CD did not disappoint me.  I like every song on it except one, which is unusal for a CD.
B008BRC5SY|5.0|Well, guess you don't get the album is called \\"dance again... the hits\\"... it's supposed to be a dance songs compilation!! is that very hard to understand? I think if you take it from that point of view, you'd be more satisfied with the album. It's not called \\"love again... dance again... the hits\\", or something similar, which in the case would make clear that it would include dance songs along with love songs, which are also important part of her hit singles. You all should be as analytical as you are critical with the album.<br />In my case, I've always liked J Lo's music, but ironically, never had bought a single record from her...since now. The album was as good as I expected it to be. I really can't take seriously a review about a person who thinks that Jennifer cant sing ,and can't act either... if that person thinks that way... why the hell is (s)he writing a review about a compilation of someone they dont like? even more... how is it that they bought the album if they dont like it? IMHO, both, the review and the purchase, would be very stupid.<br /><br />For a J Lo's DANCE COMPILATION I give it 5 stars. I'LL SURE BE WAITING FOR THE LOVE SONGS COMPILATION!!!
B009329ZF2|3.0|I honestly expected a better movie from Peter Berg. Its ok at best I'm glad I rented it for only $3.99 and did not spend money in the theatre for it. It gets a little sappy/campy towards the end.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I have been waiting for this game, love it on my ipod and its even better on the kindle THANK YOU
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|To be honest I was really surprised how good the movie was. Storyline good, directing good, acting really good. I was surprised how good it was for a \\"tween\\" movie
B004VMVTNU|3.0|Just a clock to watch life go by.  I have used it as a wake up call when I travel and works well. However, it should be expanded.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I live this game. It starts out easy and gets progressively more difficult. Once you start playing it's tough to stop.
B001383XT8|5.0|I've been playing guitar for 6 years, I've played with a lot of pedals and pedalboards, and this little/cheap pedal, has the sound I've been looking for 3 years, now I just play with this pedal directly to my amp, don't need anymore.<br /><br />It's true that it's plastic made, but I don't think that guitar players want to throw their pedals to the wall and pee over them and hope it is still working, this thing its made for rocking! no for trowing rocks over them.<br /><br />(sorry for my english)
B006OOHYIC|5.0|this is s great game for the brain in using relaxed fun game play. you will be hooked!<br />I have it on two tablets that I use. runs really good
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|That was fun!  I've always wanted to play this, but didn't want to waste my quarters.  Now I can play all I want after waiting for more quarters.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I enjoy the funny bantering between the main characters.  It would have been more enjoyable for me if there was more drama and way less information on the kinky sex stuff.

B008220DGE|2.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Watching a Weinstein Brothers distributed film is usually a hit or miss affair. The Weinsteins are usually on more solid ground when they promote films directly tied to historical events ('The King's Speech' and 'My Week with Marilyn' come to mind). On the other hand, when they promote films rooted in fiction (films such as 'Blue Valentine' and 'Submarine'), they're usually nice to look at but their stories sometime lack verisimilitude. 'The Master' is partially in the latter category.<br /><br />'The Master' is very loosely based on the life of L. Ron Hubbard and his Scientology cult. According to Harvey Weinstein, the film is not about Scientology although the film's writer/director, Paul Thomas Anderson, admitted that Hubbard was an inspiration for the character of Lancaster Dodd (played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman).<br /><br />Set principally in 1950, 'The Master' really should be titled 'The Disciple', as the film's protagonist is not Hoffman's character 'Dodd' but a navy veteran turned drifter named 'Freddie Quell' (played by Joaquin Phoenix). Quell is a bit of a nut case who learns how to mix really strong alcoholic drinks in the Navy by adding ingredients including jet fuel and paint thinner. When we first meet him before World War II ends, he's humping a sand sculpture of a sexy woman he's constructed on a beach. Later, due to his apparent unstable nature, he's the subject of a myriad of psychiatric evaluations by Navy psychiatrists prior to his discharge.<br /><br />Quell fares no better in civilian life. After obtaining a decent job as a photographer in a department store, he ends up getting into a physical fight with a customer after badgering the man by shining his bright photographer's lights in his face. Later, he's chased out of a migrant camp after poisoning one of the workers with one of his bizarre cocktails. Unable to form normal relationships, he leaves his girlfriend Doris high and dry and decides to resume his career as a seaman.<br /><br />Quell ends up on Dodd's yacht (actually illegally borrowed) who soon falls under the spell of 'The Master', whose intrusive interviews are dubbed 'The Process'. Anderson prefers to explain Dodd's nefarious brainwashing strategy in terms of his relationship to the unstable Quell---no conscription of other new potential converts is ever examined. Slant Magazine also points out that Dodd's particular cult hardly seems real at all: \\"the film never otherwise endeavors to situate the cult in any film-specific cultural or historical context; as a result, we never gain any real sense of how large or influential the Cause is at any given time, which makes it feel like a function of the plot rather than a central, fully realized part of it.\\"<br /><br />Is there anything Mr. Anderson's could have done differently with his Hubbard stand-in? I imagine the real-life Hubbard to be far more sinister and charming than how Dodd comes off here. Perhaps his machinations are too much to be expected or simply not dramatic enough, to hold many viewers' interest. Dodd's initial 'processing' encounter with Freddie was interesting enough but eventually the control-freak persona, proves less compelling. With Dodd, there's little change in the character arc. Some may be impressed he turns his back on Freddie in the jail, his rebuff of Helen when she criticizes a word change in his book, his rigid stance in ordering Freddie to ride the motorcycle into the desert and then of course, Dodd's final ultimatum for Freddie to devote himself to 'The Cause' or leave the cult for good. But by film's end, Anderson's Dodd, is pretty much the standard Hubbard-like character we were expecting.<br /><br />Quell, the loose cannon with an uncontrollable drinking problem, is more interesting as the cult members are actually AFRAID of him. The twist here (and this is perhaps the most interesting aspect of the film), Dodd's cult is far more stable than the damaged goods veteran.<br /><br />What does Anderson want us to take away from 'The Master'? This has perplexed many people including myself. While Quell leaves the cult, he hardly can be viewed as having dissociated himself from their negative influence. In fact, while he has sex with the woman at film's end, he recites questions from his initial processing with Dodd.<br /><br />In the end, there are no great revelations here. As to Dodd's (Hubbard's) manipulative ways--we already knew about that, going into 'The Master'. As for Quell, I suppose he's supposed to be some kind of tragic figure that Anderson has given us the opportunity to ponder about. Some have suggested that he's a symbol of a post-war malaise. For my part, I would have much preferred to see a character who liked himself--that is, with some kind of ego--rather the hard-to-believe, empty shell seen here.<br /><br />Hoffman proffers up an Orson Welles-like performance but is saddled by the often ponderous script. Phoenix is too reflexively angry to be always believable. The female characters played by Amy Adams and Laura Dern have little to do, except reinforce our knowledge of Dodd's unceasing rigidity.<br /><br />By fictionalizing the real Scientology story behind it, 'The Master' avoids some of the more troubling issues that have become associated with cults today. The film's strength rests on its excellent cinematography, invoking a bleak, post-war canvas, reminiscent of some of the moody noirs of those days. But the slow-moving story often feels predictable especially in regards to the Svengali-like Dodd, who Anderson struggles to make sympathetic and different at the same time. Others will be confused by the film's overall point, as there's no one to root for, especially with such a grim protagonist, only perhaps very partially reflective of an actual, real person.oods veteran.<br /><br />What does Anderson want us to take away from 'The Master'?

B008BIN9EW|5.0|first thing first, I'm playing on a kindle fire. ive had the game for a few months now. its a great complex turn-based game that takes strategy and a keen eye to master. only negative is for my ios ipod is that you cant edit maps yet. but it is only $1 for apple products, so it makes up for it. I would definenlty play online, campaign gets old. I doubt anyone will ever see this but thanks :)<br /><br />btw I rarely rate games unless I love them!
B008BIN9EW|5.0|This is a fun old school turn-based strategy game. Checkers + mini version of Starcraft = Uniwars. Players take turns creating an army while taking note of the terrain and army units' advantages. I had fun playing the game. Good app for a down time.

B0092MKFIY|5.0|I honestly don't remember how I came across the previous album, Continued Silence, while browsing on Amazon; but I took a chance and purchased it.  It quickly became one of my favorite new albums.  When I received notice of this new release, Night Visions, I snatched it up immediately.  It certainly did not disappoint! If you liked Continued Silence, you will definitely enjoy Night Visions. Worth every penny.
B00881VLCE|5.0|its a very fun game and I love to play it just about every day and the puzzles are very fun.
B008IZ62IS|5.0|Wonderful writing, well acted and funny.  OK, there are the gory parts; we are talking about a serial killer killing other serial killers.  I especially enjoy watching this with my niece.  Gotta talk about this with a friend, that's for sure!!!  Enjoy.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A page turner. Well-written with extremely likeable characters. My only quibbles likely relate to my not being used to the pace and plotting of YA fiction, but that's my issue. I imagine the book's intended audience will love it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Initially, i was not to sure about the storyline in the first couple chapters but when tone of the book changed i was thrilled. This book is an addictive game of vicious cat and mouse. You sit back and hope your marriage could never be this nuclear. I totally recommend this book, especially to newlyweds...
0451457994|4.0|One of those stories where the addage - \\"The book is better than the film\\" is very true. An epic, thought provoking tale, sadly let down by the movie.
B004AUGJS8|1.0|This movie was charming and sort of interesting at the beginning, boring in the middle, and disappointing at the end. I'm glad I watched it on Amazon Prime because I would have been upset had I paid for it. The acting is decent, but overall fairly dull (a shame since they had a good cast), and the only likable character is portrayed by Kirsten Dunst. I wanted to stop halfway through but was slightly curious as to how it might continue. Curiosity was my downfall, as I lost another 50 minutes of my life to this snorefest.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Sat down a watched the Hunger Games with my family this the first installment of many to come is a classic for tomorrow. The DVD came on time and amazon again lived up to its reputation. A great addition to my library.
B008J34466|5.0|Very happy with the whole album. She just gets better  with each release. Great lyrics, very good mixing, wonderful vocals.
058201736X|5.0|This is a book that everyone should read which will make people appreciate the life that they have now. I can't imagine having to live in fear from the Germans and having to hide in one room above an office for such a long period of time. This is truly a remarkable story.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Great edition of this app! The various themes and complexity makes this app a pleasant diversion.  Would like to see more of this type of game made available - free!
B00913DPW2|1.0|i had heard good things about this game and was excited to play it. i installed it but it won't work at all even after i redownloaded it several times. so basically I've lost my money and a fun time. boooooo! game was download on pandigital tablet.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|Being a former<br />Marine , this book brought back so many memories . Should be required reading for all today's youth . I don't think they have a clue what a price was paid for their freedom .
B0087HT36U|4.0|Sort've like angry birds but funner.  Instead of shooting at buildings from the sidethe player takes them on from the front.  Hopefully a sequel is in the works.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|\\"Bones Are Forever\\" is another great installment in the Bones' series. It contained a good plot full of tension and suspense.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I wanted to see the movie but thought I should read the book first. I‘m glad I did. What a great book!!
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I was surprised by this book. I have a thing for amnesia stories, but am usually disappointed once the character's memory starts coming back (as in, \\"I read through all the mystery to find out nothing of consequence?\\"). I read this story fast - couldn't get enough of it - and I really liked it and how it ended. There are a few minor plot implausibilities, but otherwise the story works really well. It's a story that keeps you on your toes - it has plenty of action, but does not dwell on fighting / action scenes too much. The characters are perhaps a bit flat, but it didn't bother me (it's an amnesia story, after all). I highly recommend this book.
0425263908|2.0|I was surprised that I didn't like this book so much. I just never believed in the characters. They seemed dull and blank. It's not an awful book, it's well written, but I just really didn't get into it at all and I struggled to finish it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Good book. Keeps you wanting to read the second of the trilogy at the end.  Keep asking yourself why Christian is so dominant.  The second book even better if you like true romance.  Now reading the third in the trilogy! Love it.<br />Great job EL James!  When are you coming out with more of her books???
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I used this app all the time when I was on vacation and not consitantly connected to the Internet.  I could write where ever I was and save the document.  Then once I reached a place with Internet I connected and sent everything to the main server so it would be saved in one place.<br />Overall a great program that I would highly recommend.<br />My issue with it,  might also be an issue with the spelling feature on the Kindle, is the spelling program.  I'm not a fantastic speller to begin with and this program does not help.
B008469DGY|5.0|This is the most addicting game ive ever played. Its like a great book that has only 3 to 5 page chapters, its easy to keep saying to yourself ( just one more, just one more ).
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I like this game but I wish that you could visit with friends you know without facebook and that I wish that when you visit friends it wouldn't glitch
B009329ZF2|2.0|This film should not have been made. The story is laughable, derivative and falls flat on its face. The two redeeming features were watching Rihanna and the (presumably) CGI Battleship. This film tries to be a summer blockbuster exploiting the proven formula of predecessors such as \\"Independence Day\\". However where Independence Day had a witty and at times quite clever script along with over-the-top acting, memorable characters and outrageous CGI, Battleships had none of these attributes. It is plain stupid. Liam Neeson, who is an entirely believable Command figure, is completely wasted in this miserable production. I did like Rihanna but I really can't say she was given an opportunity to prove her acting abilities. I do hope we see her in more films. Message to Hollywood. You need to cast your net wider for engaging stories, and stop poaching the talentless writers from the SyFy cable channel.
B004UID2LC|3.0|I love this app completely but I am a little frusterated about why I cant use it any more I cant even watch youtube any more with out downloading it
B002UM5BXW|4.0|I read a lot about this book when it came out, but never actually read it until now. In spite of the familiarity of its often-quoted \\"Never eat fish on Mondays\\" and other gems that have become well-known, I enjoyed the freshness of the book and Bourdain's irreverent humor. Obviously, it's not great literature, but it's amusing, especially if you enjoy eating out and cooking.<br /><br />Jane Newhagen<br />author of Sand Dollar ~ a tale of old Key West

B006UUK612|4.0|I love this movie. I was glad to see it on here since I haven't seen it since I was a kid. Watching it again brought back fond memories from when I was a kid .
B0091XRL86|4.0|Cute movie for the entire family. Nice soundtrack, if you like Wallace and gromit you'll definitely enjoy this movie.  Great job depicting the queen lol.
B001LM1456|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  It was easy to watch via my IPad with amazon rental.  Even enjoyed watching a second time with my 13 year old twins via my laptop.  It was available 24 hours to watch multiple times if desired. I really like this version.  I really like Edward Norton.  Another good watch is  The Illusiinist.
0385344333|1.0|Worst book he has written. I agree with one of the reviewers. Did someone else write the book? 160 pages to get to the plot?<br />Maybe some of my negativity is because of his sellout to big movie companies. Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher? Come on!<br />What a slap in the face to all of Lee Child faithful readers.

1451696191|5.0|I admit I wanted to read this book after I saw the preview of the movie.  I like Emma Watson a lot and she has good taste in movies I think.  Anyways, I recently bought this book and had it read in five days, it would have been sooner except I'm back in school and that takes up most all of my time.  Without it I would have been done in a day or maybe two.  I highly recommend you read this book.  It was cleverly written since each chapter is actually a letter that Charlie is writing to someone unknown about what is happening in his life.  You feel for the kid you really do.  I can see why Emma Watson wanted to do this movie.  I can't wait to see the adaptation and how these actors portray them.  Should be good since the writer of the book is also producing and directing the movie as well.<br /><br />If you want a quick read and a good one at that, I would hands down recommend this one!! You won't regret it.  Then you'll also want to see the movie too I bet.  lol.  Just a prediction of mine.

B000TDGGVU|4.0|It reads like a text on Social Psychology. However, it is an excellent review on the effects of the choices we have in today's society.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|First remember this is being written from the perspective of a young 20 something year old. There are strange words thrown out when you wouldn't expect them and I am thankful for my built in dictionary. Being that I'd read that in reviews before, I wasn't upset to find it to be true. I read this book, and the others, for entertainment. I wasn't expecting it to be more than it was.
B005K01VZS|5.0|I would be hard put to choose between Have a Little Faith and Tuesdays with Morrie. They both touched me in ways that couldn't have been foreseen. I had read it once long ago and spent part of the last two weeks of my sister's life reading it to her. We laughed over it together and cried over it together and thoroughly enjoyed both the content and the memories of our shared childhood that it evoked.<br />There is something in there for everyone. If you already believe in a higher being it shows you how little it matters what form your higher being takes. It is the belief itself that counts and not the form. If you don't believe in a higher being it gives you pause for thought and maybe re-evaluation. Most of all it reminds you that people are people no matter what their background.<br />Well worth reading at least once and more enjoyable second time around.

B0051UH6YM|5.0|This book will have you laughing at uptight grammar and punctuation people in the beginning. Keep reading. They turn you into one. This book makes learning a very dull and tedious subject fun. You get a chance to see some very bad punctuation (I must add in places that SHOULD know better.)and grammar. As you see what not to do, you begin to understand what you should do. I highly recommend this book for any serious writer.<br />[[ASIN:0977476774 In and Out of Madness]]<br />[[ASIN:B0040GJHX6 In and Out of Madness]]

I couldn't put this book down! I loved the insights, the wicked British humor and just all around great book.  Most women I know would get a lot out of this book, I'm planning on reading it again and again as it's surprisingly full of wisdom.

Loved it.

B007VUCAVO|5.0|I was skeptical at first, however; I continuously use this app to know how much longer I can use my kindle fire before having to plug in the charging adapter. I decided to pay the $2.00 after testing the app for about a week, I figured that it was worth crediting the person who made the app. I do feel that its worth more, but $2.00 is nothing. Don't forget to calibrate the app once you get it... Yes it takes a while to calibrate but you'll get exact results continuously afterwards. It takes about an hour to calibrate so make sure you have time set aside for it.

0307960471|4.0|Harry Hole, a former detective with the Oslo police department and protagonist of [[ASIN:0307742997 The Snowman]], has spent the last three years in Hong Kong. He's not quite the man he once was. He may be managing his alcoholism and other addictions, but he's tormented by a past that has left him emotionally and physically scarred. He has a titanium prosthesis in place of one of his fingers. His main reason for the replacement digit is so that he can still chain smoke, although the prosthesis plays a significant part in the story.<br /><br />He's back in Norway because his former lover's son, Oleg, is in prison for murdering a drug dealer named Gusto, whose body was discovered in a drug den. Though the murder weapon wasn't found, all the other circumstantial evidence points at Oleg, who was arrested near the scene of the crime with Gusto's blood on his shirt and gunshot residue on his sleeve.<br /><br />Harry considered Oleg his surrogate son when he was with Rakel, so the case is personal for him. Though he has no authority, he behaves as if he was still a member of the department, calling in favors from past associates. Naturally, the investigation brings him and Rakel back into close contact, with possibly predictable results.<br /><br />Since Harry left Norway, Oleg's life has been in a downward spiral. He got tangled up with drugs. Of late it has been \\"violin,\\" a new synthetic heroin that has been flooding the streets. Violin has advantages over other street drugs: it lasts longer and there are few overdoses. The drug is gradually pushing its competitors off the market, establishing a monopoly in Oslo's darker corners, of which there seem to be many. Like most crime writers, Nesbø depicts parts of his native land that few tourists experience.<br /><br />Lurking behind the scenes is a shadowy figure known to the drug dealers as Dubai, the phantom for which the book is named. Connections from his organized crime network extend into various police organizations and into the political realm as well. A \\"burner\\" (called a mole in some circles) inside the organized crime division keeps the criminals current about any threatening investigations, greases some bureaucratic wheels and cleans up messes when they occur.<br /><br />When Harry starts, he has hold of only a single thread of this complicated tapestry. The more he tugs at it, the more he unravels, making him a target. The plot becomes more and more convoluted and Harry's exploits become increasingly harrowing and incredible. The way he extricates himself from certain predicaments strain at credibility and the story's resolution relies on some rather convenient coincidences. Just when it seems like Nesbø has pulled off his coup de grâce, he whips out even greater surprises.<br /><br />One odd aspect of the book is that sections are narrated in first person by Gusto as he dies. Also, there are parts narrated by a rat that encounters Gusto's body. What this is meant to convey remains unclear. Though Gusto obviously knows who pulled the trigger on him from the beginning of the book, he is coy with the details. The book would not have been significantly hampered if these sections had been removed.<br /><br />Though he has his own unique phantoms, Harry is another in a long line of dark, depressed protagonists, which are almost becoming a stereotype. He's as battered as a punching bag, but still irresistible to women and smarter than the average megalomaniac. He can handle anything thrown at him, dodge bullets, avoid capture by criminals and squads of police alike, sweet talk little old ladies, and sew up his injuries with needle and thread. In short, he's James Bond after being put through the wringer. Still, Nesbø's novels are sufficiently fast paced and the storylines amply convoluted to keep readers turning the pages until the bitter end.and into the political realm as well.

B007GCY8FS|2.0|The last two Reacher books have been disappointing to me. In this latest book Child makes the car rides which take up a good portion of the book, boring and never ending. The characters are uninteresting and the ending not worth the reading. I don't know what has happened to Lee Child, but my next book by him will definitely not be \\"pre-ordered.\\" I will wait for the reviews of others. I found the pace extremely slow, and the plot deserved at best, a short story envelope. Will the old Lee Child please come back?

B003ZJUIGO|4.0|Deepest Purple was initially released in 1980 and wasn't the first, but it might have been the best Deep Purple compliation up to that time. Warner Brothers \\"When We Rock, We Rock and When We Roll, We Roll\\" covered more ground, but left out some essential tracks. Since 1980 there have been dozens, if not more, Deep Purple compilations. However, other than the box sets, most didn't offer a comprehensive collection of hits and album tracks like this album did. I often wondered if they'd ever remaster this and expand it, utilizing the extra room a CD offered. Well, they finally did it. Not to mention adding a DVD, with song by song commentary by the heart and soul of Deep Purple, the late, great, Jon Lord (RIP). So, was it worth the wait? Let's see.<br /><br />The collection is worth it for the DVD alone. Most of the videos were already available on the \\"History, Hits & Highlights\\" release a couple of years ago, but Jon's commentary is delightful and insightful. Minor quibbles about the videos used, like the same edited \\"Demon's Eye\\" used on the H,H & H DVD. Would have been nice to see the full, unedited clip available for years on bootlegs. Sure, it's B&W and has a time code, but it doesn't have the audience interviews inserted over the music like this one. The awful \\"Strange Kind Of Woman\\" conceptual video is here (again) and wasn't worth watching on H,H & H, let alone again here. Interesting video for \\"Woman From Tokyo\\", made to look like a vintage 70's clip. However, they use the single edit of the song and it's over in less than 3 minutes. Of course the cream of the crop is the use of footage from Japan in 1972 for \\"Space Truckin'\\". If you've been a fan of \\"Made In Japan\\" for years, this one is sure to give you goosebumps. Unfortunately it appears they're going to release that footage sparingly, ensuring that the cash flow doesn't stop anytime soon. \\"Child In Time\\" is an interesting composite of \\"Doing Their Thing\\" footage, concert and backstage footage from several years later and news footage of police using water cannons to break up crowds. Not sure it really works as intended or if I'd ever even watch it again. Nice effort made there though. \\"Black Night\\", \\"Speed King\\", Fireball\\" and \\"Never Before\\" are all the same videos of the band either miming in the studio, on television or sync'd to unrelated live footage. Jon's comments are the real reason to watch though.<br /><br />What about the CD? First off, the sound is a HUGE improvement over the original CD release. They've added four more songs, so that all four line-ups from the band's original 1968-1976 run are represented. However, that's not the good news you'd expect. For some reason, they give us the single edit of \\"You Keep On Moving\\" to represent MkIV. Adding \\"Soldier of Fortune\\" must have seemed nice, but I wish they'd added the criminally overlooked \\"Rat Bat Blue\\" instead. It got a lot of airplay back in '73, where \\"Soldier of Fortune\\" was just a nice track at the end of \\"Stormbringer\\". Why that album merits two tracks is beyond me. They also added \\"When A Blindman Cries\\", which to give it credit, is a GREAT Purple track. But it was a B-side and doesn't belong here. Adding it just magnifies the focus on the Machine Head sessions (4 songs worth), which hardly need the attention. Besides, they don't even give us the original B-side version. Instead, we get the 1997 remix, which personally didn't do much for me. The CD's sound IS superb though and makes for a great listen. It's not chronological, so some of the extreme style changes are jarring when heard back to back. The initial version wasn't chronological either though, so that's not something they've done to the remaster.<br /><br />Finally, the packaging. Nice reproduction of the original front and back of the album on the CD booklet. Also has some nice liner notes inside. However, the outer slipcase modifies the back cover to coincide with the expanded coverage of MkI and MkIV. Sadly, there appears to have been very little thought or effort made to get pictures of Evans, Simper and Bolin that fit with the general theme of the cover. All the photos for the orginal back cover were live shots in color. The three new photos are cheaply cropped B&W images of Rod, Nick and Tommy, sitting or standing around somewhere. Seriously? They couldn't find any live shots to go along with the spirit of the other photos? The three new shots just looked cheaply tacked on, which apparently they were.<br /><br />Reading back over this, I'm afraid it comes off more negative than I intended. This is a GREAT album, with a nice DVD and for under $10.00 it's a steal. For a single disc, comprehensive look at the 68-76 era, you won't find anything else close to it. I paid $8.76 or something close to that (including shipping costs) and it was worth every penny. There isn't likely to be another band of the caliber of Deep Purple again. This disc captures the sound and fury they were capable of in that glorious eight year run, at least in the studio. For their live abilities, you'll need to go no further than \\"Made In Japan\\".

0380730405|4.0|I enjoy literary fiction now and then, although it's not my usual fare, for the three-dimensional characters and polished prose. I am, however, fairly indifferent to symbolism and other literary devices (maybe I'll develop more appreciation for them eventually, once my school days are far enough behind me). And I have the feeling that if I were a lover of literary devices and critical essays, I'd give this book 5 stars. As it is.... a solid 4.<br /><br />The basic plot: the young, unnamed narrator receives a surprise proposal from an older man, Maxim, and moves with him to Manderley, his enormous estate. But no one can stop thinking about his recently-dead first wife, Rebecca, and there's something increasingly ominous about all of this....<br /><br />The plot is compelling and suspenseful without falling too far into horror, and I quite enjoyed reading it. The narrator in particular is incredibly well-realized; her shyness and self-consciousness have turned off some readers, but I found her so completely believable and relatable that this didn't bother me a bit. The secondary characters are also vivid and realistic. Maxim and Rebecca, however, gave me a bit of trouble. Maxim is rather distant for much of the book, and I was never quite sure who he was. As for Rebecca....<br /><br />MAJOR SPOILERS<br /><br />I am still trying to work out my reaction to Rebecca. Part of this is my unique experience with the book--I let a friend spoil me years ago, thinking I'd probably never read it, and she interpreted the book very differently; her view was that Rebecca is slowly revealed to be a villain, such that the reader understands and accepts Maxim's murdering her. To me, it seemed we get very few hints of Rebecca's imperfections before being simply told that she was a sociopath (although that word isn't actually used), and so I never had any visceral response to her nor thought Maxim's actions excusable. In part this may be because times have changed; a large part of what's supposed to make Rebecca so awful is her rampant adultery, which just isn't as horrifying today as it may have been in the 1930s.<br /><br />All that aside, I'm not entirely comfortable with the juxtaposition of the good-hearted, timid narrator whose life revolves around her husband with the sociopathic Rebecca, who's dynamic and has a life and doesn't need men (but seduces and manipulates them for fun). It's not uncommon for early-20th-century novels to portray \\"good\\" women who are shy and let love dominate their lives, while the \\"bad\\" ones want more and do more (and not caring for men, in these cases, always means engaging in romantic relationships with them anyway, but in selfish and destructive ways); a rather unfortunate worldview that we've hopefully gotten past today. At least there is the more confident and also good-hearted Beatrice to balance things out a bit.<br /><br />/SPOILERS<br /><br />At any rate, the author does a great job with the setting--which reminds me of an old movie--and with atmosphere and suspense. Everything from the weather to the plants on the estate is imbued with potentially sinister, anthropomorphic qualities. (Occasionally I had my doubts as to whether weather actually works as described, but it makes for good storytelling.) And the writing is, indeed, very good throughout. I'll leave you with a passage I particularly liked:<br /><br />\\"I wondered why it was that places are so much lovelier when one is alone. How commonplace and stupid it would be if I had a friend now, sitting beside me, someone I had known at school, who would say: `By-the-way, I saw old Hilda the other day. You remember her, the one who was so good at tennis. She's married, with two children.' And the blue-bells beside us unnoticed, and the pigeons overhead unheard. I did not want anyone with me.\\"<br /><br />It takes a very good book for me to start marking passages I like, and I'd recommend this one.

1401232590|5.0|In my most humble opinion, this is one of the greatest Batman stories you will ever read. Apparently Christopher Nolan thought so too, which is why he used this novel as a heavy basis for his Batman film trilogy. If you know anything about comics you've probably heard the name Jeph Loeb. Lets just say Jeph Loeb has been so influential in the world of comics and specifically Batman's world of comics that the original Commissioner of the Gotham City Police Department was named after him (Commissioner Loeb).<br /><br />Needless to say his writing is elite and among the best you can find in the medium as well as his story structure and overall storytelling abilities, pair that with the very appropriate Gothamesque artwork of Tim Sale and you have a collection of great Batman stories (Haunted Knight, Dark Victory and The Long Halloween). This novel could be read in succession of Batman: Year One, as Loeb continues the arc of the Gotham gangsters set in the aforementioned story. If done the right way, this could be a really great DC Animated film.
B006MHWXMS|4.0|I really like this app.  I love being able to put in my tasks on my kindle and then being able to pull them up on Google calendar - this is truly mobile, I can use it on the computer at work even when I don't have access to my kindle fire.
0930289331|5.0|Considered by nearly everyone (at least in the world of comics) as the gold standard of the Batman origin story. This is where I would start my journey through Batman in comics if I could do it all over again. Among the DC Animated films I would say Batman: Year One is one of the best, staying incredibly true to the novel through frame cels and dialog alike.<br /><br />If you are familiar with any of Frank Miller's other work, most notably the Sin City series, 300 and the Dark Knight Returns among others, then you are aware of his absolutely incredible command of the narrative in as few words as possible. To sum it up READ THIS BOOK, it directly influenced Christopher Nolan's Batman Trilogy and if you read the novel and then watch the films you will see how.

1401201911|4.0|If you're new to DC's Elseworlds line, I would recommend starting with the Alex Ross illustrated gem 'Kingdom Come'. Ironically without giving too much away, Kingdom Come is really more of an 'end' opposed to a beginning in the Elseworlds. If you are not already familiar with DC's Elseworlds, it is essentially an alternate future or timeline that is not canon to DC events. This makes for very exciting possibilities.<br /><br />In this novel we see what would have happen if the last ship from Krypton was sent just a few hours earlier landing the Man of Steel in the Ukraine countryside instead of a Kansas farm. You will likely not be disappointed in reading this novel if you are a fan of the DCU, all kinds of cool surprises are behind every page and if one thing will keep you interested it is that this novel has one of the greatest 'endings' that you might read.

B007KOYEOC|1.0|OK! I have now read the complete triology...That is: Fifty Shades of Grey, Fifty Shades Darker & Fifty Shades Fred, and my advice is basically not to bother!! Don't waste your time on such a load of boring garbage. The first book was NOT good...(However i gave it 4 stars only because i felt the author was clever enough to keep the reader interested enough to want to read the next book...And i gave the second book in this series the same for exactly the same reason!!!!!) Now i am reviewing this book and also all three overall. The author has written a book based on fantasy and unrealistic events that seem to be ongoing throughtout the book at around every second page and at times every page. In the second book (Fifty Shades Darker) there was a little bit more of a story line, so that was a slight improvement from the first book (Fifty Shades of Grey) that was just all sex and nothing much else but sex. This is like all the time and on every page, in many different places and in many different ways to begin with.<br />Look...To be honest with you all, I can tell you the only reason i read the third book(Fifty Shades Freed) in the end was in the hope that Jack Hyde would kill both Anna and Christian off and put an end to it all!!! But that didn't happen. So BUGGER!! Instead they (Anna and Christian) get married, have a son and in the end they are having another kid (a daughter). Of course there is a fair bit of action in between which i will spare you all the details and let you read for yourself if you are silly enough like me to read this book.  It was so painful and boring in the end i was just scim reading it to get through it quicker!I know i am not the only person that feels this way about the Fifty Shades series, as there are a few people i have been talking to recently that have read them and said exactly the same.<br />Overall just a BORING, BORING, BORING read!! If i could give it a zero star i would! A waste of my time reading it!

0307743659|5.0|I started reading on a weekend summer afternoon in 1979 at 5PM.  At 7 PM, I locked all the doors and windows in the house.  At 9 PM, I turned on all the lights, and they stayed on until I completed the book.  One of the few truly \\"can't put down\\" books I have ever read.<br /><br />A few years later, while stationed at Ft. Riley, KS, a friend borrowed a number of books from me, including The Shining.  That evening when it began to snow, I called him and told him that, not to try to influence him or anything, but the best time to read The Shining was when it snowed.  The next day he called me to curse me for getting him started on that book when he had to get up the next morning.  He was also unable to put it down and had to read it straight through.<br /><br />Unlike the majority of attempts at horror today, the Shining isn't a book that jumps out at you and yells, \\"Boo!\\"  It's not a friend wrapped up in a bedsheet rapping on walls in an attempt to unnerve you.  It's a story that creeps up on you, little by little, setting the story, giving you characters you want to root for, putting them in increasingly difficult situations until you realize you are turning the pages as quickly as you can in the hopes of \\"saving\\" that little boy and his mother from the Monster in the Overlook.<br /><br />Skip the movie by Stanley Kubrick.  Kubrick apparently skipped reading King's tremendously scary novel in hopes of creating a \\"classic\\" horror movie and he mostly only uses the trappings of King's work to paint his own work.  But then again, perhaps Kubrick understood that the reason The Shining works, is it takes it's time to set up the stories, the characters and the situation in a way that a two hour movie never could.  And yet, it's not dull, it's not slow starting nor do you get places in the book where you feel that the writer \\"padded\\" the story to draw it out a little.  Every scene, every incident, is meticulously and carefully crafted to take you to the next step as quickly as possible but without rushing you.<br /><br />Very possibly King's best, though that is hard to argue regarding a writer with so many excellently written books.as possible but without rushing you.<br /><br />Very possibly King's best, though that is hard to argue regarding a writer with so many excellently written books.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book was hard to put down knowing this was part of the Navy that I was in and served with on the ground in Vietnam.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I'm hooked ! Such a great fantasy! The best book I've  read in a long time!  You have to read all 3 books to see to see how it ends!<br />I want a Christian Grey of my very own!
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|Game is fast paced and makes you think. Play is smooth and flawless unlike most tetris like games. Need more power ups tho.
B0087HT36U|5.0|this game is awesome I love I and u might to. get it and maybe they will make a new one.
B00338QENI|5.0|I had a hard time putting the book down. Good description of black people lives in the 40's and 50's in the tobbaco fields. Very good research work on the family.
B002C6A6N6|3.0|I just love these dvds because the quality of mine are very good, they don't have any scratches, and they play very nicely on any dvd player. I watched this show from beginning to end back in the 1990's and I think Jane Seymour was well cast, as was Joe Lando (Sully), the kids, the towns folk....everyone!! Oh, yes we can't forget Cloud Dancing (Larry Sellers).  My only complaint is that there is absolutely NO EPISODE GUIDE anywhere with this set.....it's not even writtten on the insides of these seasons!<br /><br />An episode guide for a set like this is necessary to find the episodes you are looking for, because they usually contain television log lines that tell you about each episode. So I am taking two stars off for that.....shame on you A&E channel!<br /><br />A&E?  You tried to appease us by adding a list of Episodes in the cover of the First Season....that is not enough!!! You mearly, copied what is already written on the backs of each season in this set. That's another reason this product is getting only three stars.<br /><br />I liked the price of this set, it used to be much higher, but this price resembles the product a lot more....a  good deal considerring there are six seasons plus two movies, and a few good extras.<br />Like the A&E Biography on Jane Seymour, interactive menues, and tidbits about the real Colorado Springs in the 1860's.<br /><br />I wish there were interviews with Joe Lando and Jane Seymour....instead they have voice over commentaries on favorite episodes.....Joe  was absolutely gorgeous!! This series teaches youngsters high moral values in my opinion.  It doesn't have eveything I want in it, but I am still enjoying myself when I watch these. And I hope you do too.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this is a great app. I love it. it has everything I want in a weather app.<br /> I used it tonight to check on the storm that is headed our way.  thanks for a great app.
B008BIN9EW|5.0|This is a really good game. It reminds me of the earlier Mech Warrior games that were turn based. I hope this game gets expanded upon as it has almost limitless potential.
B009157BWU|5.0|A heartwarming story that will melt your heart. This film is an incredible story of survival, resilence and extraordinary love that binds all families.
B005CKPQHA|5.0|This season was great.  picked right up from the cliff hanger season 3 ending.  Walt has really embraced his role as a criminal master mind
B007V2UGPE|5.0|the game is about strategy and fun so I reply enjoy it<br />. also I'm a boss at it son
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I use this on my kindle fire.<br /><br />Not only does it let you rename, delete, copy files etc.<br />But there is a network option where you can look on your home network and (at least with a windows7 network) access the network shares.  I can now stream pictures, music and video off of my home system on my own wi-fi.<br /><br />Of course it still has to be compatible video, so had to do some conversions to mp4 but there are a lot of programs to do that these days.<br /><br />John
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This was the first time I ordered a download book and it was very easy and the process was fast.  THanks for the wonderful service, it is very much appreciated.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This really surprised me at how enjoyable and addicting this game was.  It did get progressively diffucult, however, I became determined to complete the level I was on before shutting off for the day!
B008MG1E4A|3.0|This is a straight up account of this man's experience becoming a Navy Seal and of the raid on Bin laden. The first part of the book will be familiar to anyone who has read extensively about the Navy's Seal Team selection process. His operational experience is related in a matter of fact way despite what must have been at times quite harrowing experiences. The Bin Laden raid comes off as what it was to a well trained operative: another well planned mission competently carried out.  Is it all true? We will never know because we weren't there. This description seems plausible and the author does nothing to politicize his account; a refreshing change! Secrets revealed, nah!
B0084I9QI2|5.0|This is a true treasure if you consider yourself a fan of Michael. The concert is - as anything Michael did - outstanding! The video quality is surprisingly clear and makes everything so much greater. Oh and by the way...watch out for a cute moment towards the end of \\"Bad\\" ;)
B00742GBDM|5.0|Simply a great adaptation of a glorious novel. This is one of my \\"go to\\" movies - the acting is fantastic and the story does a decent job of honoring the novel. If you are a purist, you will certainly find some reason(s) to complain -- that said, if you let the movie take you on a journey - you will recall the elements of the book that you adored and some new components that you will fall in love with..
B006OOHYIC|5.0|In spite of the fact that it takes me multiple tries to solve some of the selections, I find this a very compelling game. I like the music, the colors, and the layout. It holds my interest while being relaxing at the same time. I wish  there were hints which would help in solving those challenges which I'm unable to complete in as timely manner. Those which are given are helpful but not enough to complete the challenge. I have to quit and return later, often several times, to try and master where I'm at. Please let me know if I'm missing something.
B007FY9ZWI|5.0|It's cheap and great music that I bought from here.<br />I will come back to by another one soon. My family loves it.<br />Enjoy the great music is the best thing I want to do to relax.<br />I'm glad that I found some much cheaper one here.<br />http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002NSQ55Q/?&tag=wwwpandoracom-20<br />http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0010DKT7A/?&tag=wwwpandoracom-20
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this game is very addicting.  it freezes for a few seconds at the beginning of each level but you get use to it. very fun. I highly recommend it
B003L20IHE|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. Its really sad though, at least I thought it was. I related to the movie so I cried (yeah, I cried ! ) (a lot) The beginning is really sad and the end is really sad, but the end is that happy kind of sad. The end kind of reminded me of the end of lovely bones, different outlooks on crossing over. I feel that this movie would only be good for people that could relate to loosing a loved one, someone who knows that pain. My friend watched this movie and she said she didn't like it (because she doesn't know what its like to loose someone). I would just watch it 1 time though and make your own opinion on it.
B003XQPT9A|1.0|I adore this movie, and decided to rent it on a lark. Amazon Instant's copy is sorely lacking, however. As other reviewers have mentioned, certain versions of the movie cut \\"When Love Is Gone,\\" and this is one of them. As it is my favorite song in the movie, my enjoyment was heavily curtailed. Don't bother renting here.
B00503BN1M|3.0|When I watch a rom-com, I understand that I'm watching it for those feel good, romantic moments. However, the writing in this was sub par even for a rom-com.  The dialogue was cliche and uninspired throughout the entirety of the film, which made it hard to find any of it believable.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Short and sweet of it:<br />Great waste of time like all the classic gamees.  You won't learn anything but it is a lot of fun...
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|I saw this movie when I was a child when it was called \\"Warriors of the Wind\\". I remembered bits and pieces of the movie and couldn't for the life of me remember the name of the movie. I did some online research and found it here! I bought it and almost 30 years later I still love this movie. Thank you so much!
B0083EY9EI|5.0|Real R&B, great music from start to finish. Non-pop music with a story to tell. Beautiful new artist, I hope she's in this biz for a long time.
B000FC1MM8|4.0|The story didn't grab my attention right off but it was a good steady read. I definitely wanted to continue reading until I got to the end.
B001BZF9UY|5.0|Love to replay each scene in my mind while working and the house.  A must for any dark knight fan as this is the best of all 3.
B008MM9630|4.0|this seems to  be a good farm game. I've only played it a couple days. most of the animals are quite expensive in game crystals but there are some ways to earn them.  I play it on my kindle fire (original model) with no problems.  I haven't tried the social parts such as facebook. Spent $2.99 real money to get some crystals but won't be doing much of that.<br />NOTE The quest offers that let you get different animals to fulfil quests, have been broken on my game for 3 months now.  ALL my remaining quests require these animals, and are stuck. I have emailed support and got no response at all.  Game is fun when working, but support is non existent.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|It is always a pleasure to read Lee Child's books. His command of language is very good, his style graphic and easy to follow. I am not sure I fully recognise in Reacher a real to life person - I like the story anyhow.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Discovered evernote a couple months ago and have started using the free service and apps for everything from recipes to personal files. I love that I am able to access it from all my devices, anywhere. However, I would love to see a way to rate or rank my notes (maybe star ratings or a like button) to help me remember which notes (especially recipes) I like best.
B005IQZB14|3.0|I liked this book but I thought it was a little monotonous at times. I finished it disappointed. I expected more ....
B008B3MZMY|5.0|I had long given up on seeing a DVD live concert of Supertramp and was prepared to relive the one DVD worth seeing \\"The Story So Far\\".<br />I was wandering through my local \\"The Warehouse\\" store in Auckland today and caught a glimpse of the DVD cover in the rack. The Paris Live concert was there for $18.99 NZ and I saw that it was a 1979 concert that had gone through some degree of restoration. The track listing was impressive and I said to myself - \\"you have to have it\\".<br /><br />One of the early reviewers has summed it up pretty well in saying that for its age, the video and audio quality are surprisingly good. The picture fills the entire screen of my HD TV (ie. not a 4:3 ratio picture). The long distance shots may be a bit grainy but there are not many of these and the lighting for the close up shots is very good which provides favourable conditions for the older cameras to capture a nice clear picture (but do not expect HD quality of course).<br /><br />I have the 1981 Journey \\"Escape\\" concert and the mid 80's Dire Straits \\"Alchemy\\" concert and the picture and sound quality of the Supertramp \\"Paris\\" concert is better than these, the video is certainly better.<br /><br />For those who have a good home theatre system, you will get a nice thump from the drums through the sub. There is a full band for this concert (unlike Roger's later concert with just himself and the saxophonist).<br /><br />The big hits from the \\"Breakfast In America\\" concert sound very much like the CD (the \\"Child Of Vision\\" song has a slightly different arrangement when it gets to the long instrumental second half) and overall, this DVD had me spellbound in the chair!<br /><br />I was really impressed to hear and see the ten minute long \\"Fool's Overture\\". This was terrific to see live.<br /><br />Overall, if you have the 'Story Ss Far\\" and then buy this DVD, you will have a relatively complete history of Supertramp. If you really like this band, you will have to find this DVD something to behold!<br /><br />Enjoy.
B0087HT36U|4.0|Downloaded this as the FAOTD from Amazon.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Works well on my ViewPad, and was a nice distraction for a few days.  Not crazy about the forced review or buying the Bunker bombs, but still fun.
B000FBFML6|4.0|This book is great because it is driven not by just events but the turmoil and hardship of Fitz.  The character of the fool is developed more as lord golden and fitz is dealing with a crppling loss during this.  In all an excellent read
B00932ANQM|4.0|This is a romance movie (chick flick)from author of \\"message in a bottle\\".  It was a good story if predictable but being a guy I could take it or leave it.  I gave it a good rating because it portrays honor and character along with romance.  Watch it with your wife or girl friend and score some points!
B007G3H8Y0|1.0|I never ordered this so I don't know why I am being asked to review it...this is incorrect and should be deleted from my account
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Informative, interesting, just technical enough without being boring. Started the book one morning to \\"kill time\\" and didn't put it down until I had finished.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Excellent book, highly recommend to others. The information was very educational.  It hit home because I had a foot injury a couple of years ago and the doctor prescribed orthodics immediately.  I have stopped wearing the orthodics and wear Vibram 5 finger shoes and my foot feels better than it has in years.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I've had this for a few months now.  I have no intentions of removing it.  I can't imagine how I lived without it.  I can even choose the colors.
B000NQRE9Q|3.0|I really don't understand what George Lucas has against putting any of his material on PSN, Zune (xbox) Video Marketplace, Vudu, etc. Even Spielburg with certain movies he's directed himself refutes it. (Video rental stores don't exist anymore, remember?). Even Peter Jackson put up Lord Of The Rings after a year or two. Don't get me wrong i'm one of the biggest Indy fans on the planet, but putting all these movies in one boxset is just another way for these movie industries to make cash. Also once they are opened you can't return them. We've been dooped in the past from Spielburg with the ultra poor Jurassic Park blu ray transfers, George Lucases over the top extra added CGI into the original Star Wars Trilogy, and so on. So it's no wonder people are in question of the newer products and have such high hope, then get let down. We never learn. Watching \\"these\\" particular films over and over, and even showing them to your kids is highly unlikely, so paying the 70$ price tag is just senseless, especially if your getting it for the special features which aren't in HD anyway. Raiders looks to me, the same as it does on Xfinity HD movies. Temple Of Doom (which is my least favorite) looks very good but still lacks super clarity. Yes i know these movies are old but take a look at what they did with Jaws, and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. They look like brand new 2012 films, not 70's.<br /><br />With a huge collection like this you would think whatever team remasters and restores them would want to take more time on it, to make it the BEST. Not the case. The Last Crusade still looks sub par to my eyes and it's only about 23 years old. Sound quality as with most is great, but we don't purchase it based on just that. So as i stated at the start, make these movies available on PSN, Xbox, VUDU, Amazon Movies etc. They you can rent it for a small price, enjoy it, then if it's not what you think just whip out the old DVDS. But we aren't given that option. I've waited since the inception of Blu Ray for these movies and i can't say i'm really happy. The restoration is ok, but not what i was expecting. And i have a great Samsung 52\\" TV. The box is pretty generic but i doubt i'll be showing people at work, saying wow look at how bad the packaging is on these blu ray set. Most would say they don't care anyways, since the \\"average\\" person doesn't even know or care what \\"blu ray\\" is. So pay the money if you want, i regrettably did. Oh well, that'll learn me. :)<br /><br />Btw-3 means it's OK, which it is.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|It was better than the first 2 books, however I only read the trilogy because I have a habit of finishing a series weather I like them or not. It was way too much of the same thing over and over.  Sex, fighting, sex, sex, .....
B007KOYEOC|3.0|Good light reading. A bit unbelievable, made you fantasize about life would be like if you where rich and money was no option.  The story gave you something to think about
B008CP92ZO|4.0|This movie was pretty funny, but not entirely original or surprising. Justin Theroux was the best part. All of the performances are solid, but his stood out. Paul Rudd and Jennifer Amiston were Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston, but that isn't really a knock. The movie was entertaining and worth watching.
0062183591|4.0|The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty: How We Lie to Everyone - Especially to Ourselves is an interesting dissection and presentation of a number of studies conducted by Dan Ariely and his associates to determine when, how, and why people lie. By setting up a series of similar experiments by altering the conditions of the experiments Ariely discovered factors that influenced people's decisions to lie. He also delved into how people excuse lying to themselves. While I found his conclusions and his methodology compelling, I couldn't help but think that the results weren't as conclusive as they appeared. A number of other factors could've been at play in the thinking processes of the participants in the study. While I believe his premise that people figure out ways to lie and maintain their self-image of being honest, I thought that before I started reading The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty. Ariely confirmed much of what I already believed about lying, but I didn't have any \\"ah-ha\\" moments while reading the book. The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty is well-written, interesting, and engaging if at times a tad academic. Ariely's results have the odd effect of making me feel both better and worse about humanity with this presentation of his research into the human struggle to be honest in the face of temptation.
0385344333|2.0|Well, Tom Cruise looks nothing like Jack Reacher, but Cruise will be the image the public gets. Author Childs has his name allover the covers of new books, blurbing for the author even when the book isn't good. Even on his own book, Childs is hustling for speaking appearances. Then he wrote that awful short e-book and ripped his fans off for $2.00 each. Now Lee Child presents this dull plod of a novel about Reacher hitchhiking and getting caught up in...what, exactly? Do we ever even know? It's a boring story where one could skip pages and not miss a thing. So, it's time to wrap it up, Mr. Childs. Time to say goodbye.
B002ZBRSIY|4.0|I have enjoyed the whole Oceans series.  Clooney an Pitt really make the movie for me, and Casey Affleck is pretty surprising, funny guy.
B004I744AS|5.0|This is a great app to have because it's a lot more convenient to carry around than a huge dictionary.  Plus thesaurus.
B0052U59F4|2.0|I think the only thing that would really keep me reading this book is to find out how the author (hopefully) transitioned the controlling nature of the main character, Christian Grey.  The \\"naughty\\" scenes were so repetitious it turned me completely off from turning the next page.  All the \\"hype\\" about how sexy this book was was overkill for me.  The majority of my friends that have read it have really liked the trilogy and I wouldn't discourage anyone from reading it; just to let them know my thoughts.  Try to buy it on sale if you can.
B00785P2QC|5.0|u build ur own town lots of fun but needs also lots of time and patience.  easy to understand nothing hard
B003YL4LYI|3.0|When does a strength become a weakness? I read the first three books of the series awed by the author's ability to kill characters who I thought were pretty central to the story and also create new and exciting characters. However, in book four and five I am not sure if it works so well. (spoiler alert) I think the problem is that the story does not move. Characters like dannerys agonize over their decisions for virtually the whole book.<br /><br />Of course I will read the next book when it comes out but I do hope that George Martin moves the stories forward. Not necessarily towards a conclusion but forward.
B001NHNG64|4.0|I read the Killing Floor as my first Jack Reacher book and could not put it down.  I immediately downloaded the kindle version of the second book and felt the same. They are fast reads with exciting plots. Looking forward to the third book as soon as I am finished with Frozen Heat, the new Richard Castle book.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|love this app. You can chose different sounds, ocean ,chimes ,or many others. You can put as many as you want together at once. It means you don't have to listen to the same one all the time.
B0001I55SS|4.0|I just watched \\"Black Hole\\" for the first time in decades, and I have to admit I was impressed.  It is a flawed film--scientifically bizarre, based more on theology to be honest, with an esoteric ending that makes no sense whatsoever--but still, a solid film.<br /><br />I enjoyed the mood and atmosphere of the film most of all.  It is an interesting take on the Captain Nemo mythology of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, with a mad ship captain obsessed with his voyage.  In fact, more so than science fiction, this film is science fantasy on par with Star Wars.  It explores classic myths in a futuristic setting, with an operatic score that makes all the difference.<br /><br />The special effects still hold up well. The USS Cygnus is stunning, with a palatable loneliness.  I remember being blown away by the effects when I saw this in the theater, and while I am no longer so amazed I am not disappointed either.<br /><br />The acting holds up well. Everyone did an excellent job, and there are some top-notch talents in this film. Anthony Perkins in particular does a standout job, as does Ernest Borgnine.<br /><br />With all the `80s flicks that have been remade recently, I think \\"Black Hole\\" would is due.  This film holds up as well as \\"Tron,\\" \\"Battlestar Galactica,\\" or any of the others.  And I love the idea of Captain Nemo in space.  Just keep that mood and that amazing score, update the science, and you have winner.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a long time! I simply found it impossible to put down, not only that I'm extremely sad that there is only one more book to this series.
B006TKP2B2|2.0|Paolo Bacigalupi's novel is cast in a post-apocalyptic setting Thailand.  This is a very dark narrative.  At the beginning, the direction of things is obscure, but as one reads further, it becomes clear that the principals function in a world in which the food supply has become compromised by runaway genetic modifications that in turn cause fatal human disease.  Political elements, corporate entities and private individuals interact in an atmosphere of intrigue and physical violence, competing for control of the food (the author uses the term, \\"calories\\"). Genetically modified animals provide the power for machines and devices, the power being stored in kink springs for later use.  The windup girl is a prostitute, one of a race of humanoids created to provide physical pleasure for humans.  Her character is nicely drawn out and did engage this reader.  Other windups are engineered to be superior warriors.  So, a (not sub-plot, but co-plot) is the life and fate of windup humanoids and the discrimination they endure.  This aspect of the work could be taken allegorically as a parallel to inter-racial or other forms of discrimination and was perhaps the most interesting aspect of the novel.  Overall, though, Windup Girl did not engage this reader.  The writing style seemed inelegant and at times, gratuitously crude,  and the descriptions of the mutations lacked plausible scientific underpinnings.  In addition, the story line tended to meander rather than progress in a purposeful direction.  Furthermore, the author's frequent inclusion of nouns, fragments of conversations and descriptions in the Thai language will be confusing to those not knowledgeable in that language.<br /><br />Reading through The Windup Girl  became a chore for this reader, rather than being stimulating or enjoyable.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|No Easy Day was an easy read and had an easy flow to it. It described how difficult it was to become a Seal and also  some of the training without getting to specific.  I assume this was done so that the reader would appreciate what Seals have to go through in training as well as combat.  It is apparent what the great sacrifices not only the seals, but also their families have to endure.  The families not knowing where their son,husband, father is and what he is doing and the Seal having to blot out the danger from his mind and keeping focused on his job and trusting his fellow seals to have his back.  The description of their effort to capture/kill Bin Laden was well written and described.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A courageous act by a real American hero to go against the \\"D.C. Suits.\\" This is the story that had to be told by someone who was there. The author has been accused of writing his account for monetary gain,I believe he did it to tell the real story and to give credit to the entire team that tracked down \\"UBL\\" not just those that were on the ground. What is most gratifying is knowing that the author is one of thousands of Special Forces dedicated operators willing to sacrifice themselves for what they believe in. My wish is that some young person will read this book and dedicate themselves to emulate this hero and not the over paid prima-donnas of professional athletes or rock stars.
B0086700CM|1.0|I had this game on my sis's ipod and it was perfectly fine. It did not freze or anything so I got it on my kindle fire. It keeps frezing up and I cant play it or I die every time. You may have a different experience, this is just my experience. ;-)
B008XG1X18|2.0|Lots of cool stuff on here to cook & craft & decorate your home. Or yourself. Bottom line. I believe I am in the majority with my thoughts on this. While this stuff is all neat & nice, I never seem to find the time to do this things. Or when I cook the recipes. For the most part. They don't come out tasting good. Even if I make them exactly as they are written. So. While I admire the pretty things on this website, I probably won't spend a lot of time on here.
B008MEM24S|3.0|It is a great game, but I'm tired of waiting for the new levels to come out. Oh, and I love it when Perry makes his little noise.  :)

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I loved this book. It kept my interest from the beginning. I don't usually read this type of book but was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this read.
B008UUPOVM|5.0|I like owl city's new album I listen to it often. I enjoy the music and how it sounds. My favorite song is \\"Dreams and disasters\\" because I enjoy its lyrics.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I have no idea why I like this game it's so simple yet VERY entertaining! Hope y'all enjoy it as much as I do :)
B00001OH7N|5.0|I'd heard this when it came out years ago, I had the album.  Loved it then, and I still love it.  Bowie was the first artist to paste his album cover in a dress.  Bowie was great in his heyday.  His big break came when he put out Ziggy Stardust & the spiders from mars.  I missed see him when he came to our town, I've regreted it ever since, but I didn't have money to buy a ticket.  And the show was great, so I heard.  And since then many have covered his works.  I knew he was going to be a star when I heard Hunky Dory, and the rest is history.  Bowie rules!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|a fun and addictive app. when your bored this is a good app to pass the time. its just the waiting for more coins thing that isn't good,  but still cool app, recommended!
B0061PEAUY|5.0|Reichs had me enthralled on the first page and scores gold again with this great crime thriller. Riveting and fast paced. A great read!
B0031RS2HC|4.0|He never fails to please.  I find it hard to not get caught up in the story and the places he takes you.  The suspense is great, I think it is a great read.
0525953728|4.0|When I first heard that OBL was killed on TV, I immediately wondered how things went down. This book gave an in-depth answer to my question. Very fast read, I finished in 2 days without spending too much time each day. Some sections were a bit slow but the OBL capture sections were hard to put down.
B000TETD9Q|5.0|As always, you can't find any better music than the Beach Boys. It really brings back the memories.  It sure beats the music kids listen to today.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I read the rest of the series because ...curiosity killed the cat..I guess.  Everyone kept raving about these books.  I found them to be repetitve (extremely repetitive)but I wanted to know how it ended.  Kudos to the author for finding a way to make me spend money on 3 books, when I really could have just read one.
B001NHNG64|5.0|I had a customer recommend I read Lee Child's books.  I started with the first Jack Reacher series, now I am stuck on them.  If you want a good book to sit around the fireplace and read get a book by Lee Child and you won't go wrong.

B007SGM084|3.0|I was not that impressed with the novel - the writing was mediocre at best and the plot was very repetitive.  It reminded me of a porn movie, except it had somewhat of a plot.  Have no idea how it made the best seller list except people like to read about sex especially kinky sex.

1451627297|3.0|The date tells us all what to expect...but then this story is written by THE story teller-S.K.<br /><br />The story begins with Jake Epping, a teacher, and his assignment to his students: write about an event that was so astounding it changed your life.<br /><br />The harrowing events they write about is just the beginning. The clincher is a portal to the past harbored in a diner...Al's diner. This portal and a new identity takes Jake on a journey and a quest. The journey is into the past and the quest is to change or prevent these harrowing events from happening and thereby changing history itself.<br /><br />I've enjoyed many of THE story teller's books and movies but, this was (for me) much to long. It could have been cut or edited down in so many places. I also found much of the blood and guts detail repulsive. That's me.<br /><br />So although this may have been a labor of love for THE story teller...I can't give it more than 3 stars.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This book is an easy read, seems well organized and well written.  I thought it would be blow by blow detail on the Bin Laden raid, but actually it gives a little history of the author and some of his training and experience leading up to the raid.  Not too much, just enough to get you familiar with what the seals do and to immerse you in the seal life when the call comes for the raid.  There were enough details in the book that I'm a little concerned that anyone (i.e. terrorists) can learn too much about how raids are planned and executed and how our military units are structured.  But I bought and read the book, so I can't complain too much without being  hypocritical. I always wondered why the tail of the helicopter was not destroyed in the Bin Laden compound... now I know!
B004UID2LC|1.0|At first I could download quality videos and Mp3's now it wont even let me watch anything let alone download. What's up with that?
0345803485|1.0|I have read all but about 200 pages and will finish this book.  It is disturbing to me -- I have heard of bondage but would never consent to any kind of pain in a sexual situation.  One line throughout the book totally annoyed me -- the one about her biting her lip.  It kept coming up again and again.  For some reason I just wished she would just stop or he'd stop her.  I had no fault with the writing and actually saw the author interviewed on TV.  I am sending it to a male friend of mine and am anxious to hear a man's opinion of the book.  The vomit scene was written a bit too graphically for me -- I have no idea why it was so annoying.  But I suppose if you are curious about bondage, this is the book to read. I gave it one star for being informative on the bondage topic. More than 30 million people have purchased this book.

B008BM9L72|4.0|I was reluctant to read these books because of the BDSM but was curious because of all the hype about them. Reading the first few pages of FSOG I thought \\"is the whole book going to be like this?\\" as it was young female meets good looking male i.e. blushing, dropping notebook on floor etc. but I got into the story very quickly. E.L. James has a way to keep readers interested. There is not a lot of BDSM and what is there is very mild, but the story keeps the reader going. A lot has been said about the books being badly written but the story is very good. The ending to the first book is done in a way to make readers want to start the second FSD immediately. The third book FSF was not as interesting, as there was not a lot going on in the story, but overall I enjoyed reading them.
B0085OEU1I|5.0|I love this movie. Yes its got a lot of singing and sometimes the slitting of throats doesn't seem real at times, but it is a really good movie. This is my second favorite Johnny depp movie. It only follows after Edward scissorhands. If you are thinking about getting the movie do it. As long as you get pass the singing you should enjoy this movie.
0345803507|5.0|What can I say that others have not. I really enjoyed reading the whole series -- by book three, things are a bit more 'tame' -- but that is the characters growing up.  Highly recommend reading the whole series.  Call it 'mommy porn' call it whatever you like -- if it getting people to read the book, then what matters?!
B0090P98Z4|3.0|it's ok. not so bad so far. will keep playing.<br /><br />its ok so far. not bad will keep playing it.
0307744434|4.0|The book takes you through all these different side stories, and as you are reading you are wondering when they will all come together...but they do. Wasn't sure I was going to like this book when I first started reading it, but glad that I did.  Author really makes you use your sense of visualization.  I would definitely recommend reading this book.
B008133DO8|5.0|There are so many choices on TV now all to some degree should entertain, yet in almost all is a distinct lack of substance.  Finally a series that challenges the mind, while satisfying at every level the question \\"are you entertained?\\"  Having watched the previous season, this episode is a significant leap from last season, and is really the crown jewel of a really excellent series.  With an excellent story, superior acting, and first rate filmography and editing, this plays less like a miniseries than a mini-movie- and let me add I was much more entertained by this episode than a lot of movies I've seen recently.<br /><br />To put it succinctly, if you are looking for a smart series, like mysteries, and appreciate great TV, you will love this series.  This is what Sherlock Holmes should- needs to be in the 21st century, and it is perhaps one of the more enjoyable 90 mins you'll spend in front of the TV- spend it with Dr. Watson and Sherlock
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Wow! This is one tough knife! When you first pick up this knife you know your holding something that's going to last you a very long time. If there was only one knife I could take with me on a desert island, it would be this knife. It holds an edge for an incredibly long time. At this size it's a very good all around knife. I've used it to prepare dinner on a camping trip AFTER batoning the logs I used for the fire!(I cleaned it first) Overall this is probably my favorite fixed blade knife that I own. You won't be disappointed.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game and I feel that it can appeal to various age groups. I would recommend this to anyone wanting a fun/cute game to play.
B003SHUMRI|5.0|Great chemistry and great music ...ok story line. Good view of channing Tatum and his abilities...super talented.  Worth the cheap rental price
B008OOYALE|3.0|This game is fun to play here and there but it isn't a game that I could play for an hour. It can get a little tedious at times but I enjoy playing it. I would recommend this to someone who wants a game to kill a few minutes with, but not to one wanting to kill an hour or two.
B008MZPVP4|3.0|The riffs are the album are filled with sludge.  Phil's voice is far from what it was on NOLA or Down II but he is still better than most singers in hard rock/metal right now.  Pepper and Kirk haven't lost a step on the axe,  the opening riff on \\"Levitation\\" to start off the album is fantastic.  The single \\"Witchtripper\\" has some nice touches on the drums and overall song is pretty good.  The last track \\"Misfortune Teller\\" seems to be the one that stands out the most.  IMO the last song on each album is one of Down's better songs on a release.  This is up there in a 9 minute mark and has a nice groove to it throughout.<br /><br />I'm somewhat disappointed in DOWN IV but it is slightly better than most of Over the Under, and we still have more left in store.
B008602KQI|4.0|My son (14 yrs old) is a big fan of the Hunger Games book series, therefore went to see the movie together.  The movie does a nice job in getting the story across without all the gory details.  I have read the series as well and believe the movie was well done.  I do not recommend it for younger kids (9-10 yrs. & below), as believe they may not have an understanding of the story line and would scare them.  All in all, we (my son & I) loved it!
B000RHG4XS|5.0|The two main characters in this movie are played by Diego Luna and Romola Garai. (Patrick Swayze also makes a few small appearances in this film as a middle-aged hotel dance instructor who winds up helping the young heroine work through her dancing fears in regards to letting her male partner \\"lead\\" her.)<br />Both Diego and Romola create very believable and engaging characters on-screen.<br />The plot is quite interesting, involving a bit more depth than the original Dirty Dancing movie of the late 80's. It is set in Havana, Cuba, near the end of the Cuban revolution to overthrow the then-current president, Batista, and to afterwards set Fidel Castro in the prominent position of leadership.<br />The male protagonist is a native Cuban pool boy, who comes from a very poor family, and is trying to support not just himself, but his whole family - including a young male child that one of his elder brother's ex-girlfriends dropped off prior to the time when the movie begins.<br />The female protagonist is a scholarly American girl, temporarily living in Havana with her mother, father, and younger sister, until she can finish the 2nd half of her senior year of high school, and then head back to the States for college.<br />In the beginning of the movie, the female lead is not pleased with having to move to Cuba because of her father's job promotion, but she very maturely apologizes in the first quarter of the film to her father for her initially surly attitude.<br />One of the commendable things regarding this movie is that the characters do not fall into completely stereotypical types. There is a refreshing element of un-expectability in how they do what they do, what they say, and their non-verbal expressions of what they think. The English actress Romola, in particular, is quite clearly skilled at her line of work. Any of the characters in this movie could have been portrayed by the actor or actress playing them in a cliched manner. However, I was very pleased that I rarely felt during the film that any of the scenes were at all cheesy. The movie was not perfect, by any means, but it was well-made, and the care and time put into its creation is evident.<br />I would definitely recommend this movie for someone wanting to watch any of these types of films: the romantic, teen, dancing, or feel-good variety.<br />If you are the sort of person who prefers watching movies along the more serious lines of \\"The King's Speech,\\" (starring Colin Firth), then this much more light-hearted film is probably not for you.<br />If, however, you want to view a positive movie purely for entertainment's sake, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend watching \\"Dirty Dancing - Havana Nights.\\"<br />An interesting footnote I would like to add is that the plot was derived from one woman's real-life experiences in Cuba, which were similar to those of the character Katie in the film.<br />Another intriguing tid-bit is that the actor who plays the Cuban older brother is from a natively Cuban family, and truly grew up in Cuba through his pre-teen years until his family moved to Florida. The actor's father was actually present the night the revolution over-threw President Batista in favor Fidel Castro, which is the exact same evening that is re-portrayed in this movie.<br />All in all, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this film, and by how many different aspects of it I found interesting or admired.  :)
0345803485|5.0|I love this book. There is an unexpected but great love story behind all the sex. Don't be a prude, read the book
B005H5H3LW|4.0|With the exception of the reference to the battleship of the same name in 1945, this movie provided a couple hours of space entertainment, and subtitles (which are fine with me).
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I regret buying it. It's nothing but a trashy fairy-tale with a make believe ending. I was hoping something exciting would happen but never did. All the sex scenes horribly boring, read one read them all.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book appears to be a very good accounting of what actually occurred that night when Osama got what he richly deserved. What is surprising is the way the story evolved depending on when and who reported the \\"actual\\" events as they unfolded that night versus this account. It would have been great to know the behind the scenes workings of special operations, but for obvious reasons, the reader isn't allowed into this world, and for good reason. Instead, the author gives you glimpses of what it's like to be a member of the select few who excel in their field.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Although I don't follow his politics and usually accept his sportswriting, Mitch Albom has another award winning story.  The twists and turns of the book are quick and succinct.  Mr. Albom answers questions we all ask about or of our lives.  From the Tower of Babel to medicinal phenomena (which is quite a stretch) Albom takes a simple subject and shows how complete the subject is for all TIME.
B008D28HYS|5.0|When I first opened the app, I thought of Sudoku puzzles.  The app is VERY professionally designed and easy to use, and the puzzles are even better.  It's like minesweeper and sudokus intermixed.  I love it!

B001HNE3NO|3.0|What a disappointment this book was, given how it began. I must have read the first 150 pages in one sitting. It was riveting. Then came the second half..and I found myself skimming so I could finish and at least get a resolution to Sarah's story. I couldn't have cared less for most of the modern day characters.<br />This is a holocaust story, riveting is usually built into most of them, but it started out well written, emotional, and original. Sarah, a little Jewish girl living in Paris with her Polish immigrant parents and little brother Michel, is taken on July 16, 1942 by the French police as part of the roundup the Vichy government made of thousands of Jews over a couple of days. As the police are looking for her father, she decides to hide her little brother in their secret hiding place and let him out when they return from the police station, as she is certain they will in a few days. Of course that is not how things go and she and her parents are taken to an interim camp and then transferred to a concentration camp. This part of the story is told in alternating chapters, one in 1942 and another in present day. The present day story concerns Julia, an American journalist living in Paris, who is given the assignment to cover the Vel d'Hiv on it's anniversary. She is captivated with the story, and soon discovers there is a connection to her present life and family.<br />The second half of the book is all present day. The problem with it is the wooden, stereotypical characters. Julia's husband is laughable,her daughter not believable, her sister stereotypical New York lawyer, I could go on but I'd rather not. I also found that every single person is divorced...really, in France, Italy and the USA. Now, I know marriage is not what it used to be, but really! I think even the gay couple breaks up. The superficiality of the characters is present a little in the beginning, but first you presume learning about Sarah's horrible story may make them get a clue, and second, it's blunted by the shortness of the chapters and the alternating with Sarah's story.<br />I would tell you to read the first half, because it's wonderful, but then you'll be stuck reading the second half to find out how the story ends (not a great ending, by the way, totally contrived). Pick up a non-fiction account of the Vel d'Hiv round ups and you'll learn about them and skip this book.
B00932A2MC|4.0|I thought it was a pretty good movie and it was nice to see Big Mo (Battleship Missouri BB-63) in action one more time slaying those nasty aliens.  Not a movie that requires much thought, just sit back and watch the action unfold.  Reminded me of Independence Day and Battle for LA for the most part.  But the important thing is WE WON!!  Just your basic kick the alien's butt by the good guys type of movie.
B008Y212PI|4.0|I spend way too many hours playing this game. Love it. I think some of the puzzles are fairly difficult. But you can play the puzzle over and over again until you get it right. I can't. put it down.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|For the military person, the book was well written and relevant to the situation.  The ending was probably the best part.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|So far - really cool! Like a few other games - but well done and the basic hints are very helpful! I would suggest this to anyone that likes these types of games.

B007SGM084|5.0|just an amazing book!!! it is hard to find words to truely state how amazing this trilogy is...never an moment, it keeps you interested and excited to see what will happen next. I can not wait to see what the author comes up with next.
B005EGXTL2|3.0|This book is the conclusion of the trilogy, fast paced. Characters destiny are decided, but still leaves some unanswered questions.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Way out there, enjoyed immensely, I am almost finished the 3rd book. It really makes you think about your own life, some of the decissions you have made, how we define our own Â«best friendsÂ» and in the same situations would we decide differently or the same! I find this series Â«un-put-downableÂ»

B006OOHYIC|4.0|The graphics, music and different challenges of Quell make it a interesting and fun way to pass a lazy afternoon or can even match play with another user. Not 5 stars because some of the games hints make little sense...Have tried many of these type of games but find this one different and entertaining at the same time..

B007ZD17XO|5.0|I enjoy playing Treasures of Montezuma 3. It's exciting and changeling, just when you think your doing good you get a low score.  I like it better than the 'jewel games' evan better than 'crazy bird'.  The bonus puzzles are great, when I'm ready to give up, I solve it.  I guess I get too confindent.
B000BO0LKY|4.0|A good CD and the quailty was good.  I could listen to Mimi all day. This CD could not be any better.  Love it!
B003Y7PM5E|5.0|You see, I'm from Brazil. This OST matches so perfectly with the ideology of the movie that I had to have it, doesn't matter what I had to do. It was my first purchase at Amazon.com, and everything went fine, thank God.
B000002A46|3.0|I love MiMi anything she sing but, I must say this was a little disapointing.  I was look for a more traditional CD not a here and now.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|A very entertaining book that you cannot stop reading. The content is sometimes a little too much but the story behind all the passion between them is beautiful.
B005IQZB14|4.0|I purchased this book because I read excellent reviews, such as \\"couldn't put it down\\".  I really liked the story line, but thought it got a little tiresome towards the end.  Not being a hiker, the details of the trails became monotonous.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I loved this movie! Wonderful actors/actresses, well written and a human touch with the people of India. Truly a wonderful viewing!
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I really wasn't expecting much when I bought this case but Oh My Lord it was better than any other I had ever purchased. Having a white iPhone is a real investment especially after purchase. I went through at least 4 or 5 bumpers/cases within a year at 4-5 times the price of this guy in an effort to show off my white phone while keeping it protected. I could've bought my phone all over again with the money I spent on those cases and all the screen protectors I went through.<br /><br />They were all either white or clear bumper/cases .. They all broke or turned nasty colors. Always!<br /><br />This AmazonBasics case was different. Being of a tough rubber material I was never worried if my phone was ok after it was dropped (I'm quite clumsy). The overlapping front edges of the case made it so that my screen never touched a surface if I put my phone face down. This case is sturdy, doesn't lose shape and once the phone is snapped in it cannot fall out. It also completely showed off my phone..<br /><br />This is a dream case at an unbelievable price. Even with the little bit of yellowing, which took twice as long to show up as other cases, I could buy this case over and over again without thinking twice about it.<br /><br />Now I have the iPhone 5.. I am saddened that I no longer can have my beloved case for my new phone but I will be repurchasing this case for my mom's new White 4s.<br /><br />If your still not sure about this case watch the video of the unboxing that was posted. He definitely did a good job in showing this case in all it's glory lol<br /><br />Try it! You won't regret it!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I am in love with these books!!  I could not put them down the first time I started reading them.  I do think book one is my favorite out of all three.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this app is fenomenal fuel for my pinterest addiction. what would I do without it? SUPER DUPER APP! EPIC WIN!!
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|An exciting picture with excellent acting.  I did feel that I was watching a modern day reenactment of Spartacus.  Having said that, Spartacus  is one of my favorite films.
B00973DDN2|5.0|The American story of love, economic woes, and heartbreak told through the eyes of Flowers and his Vegas rockers.  Flowers proves that he is a modern day Springsteen with his lyrics about teenage love and heartache and the band backs these lyrics with 80's tones and guitar riffs.  The album does not have an immediate appeal and the true essence of this album reveals itself after 4 or 5 listens.  Just like any other Killers album, Battle Born tells a story and every song is a chapter in the life of these imaginary characters Flowers' creates.  You may not find radio friendly songs on here outside \\"Runaways\\" though that shouldn't discourage anyone from this record.  Battle Born draws some similar themes from the band's sophomore effort \\"Sam's Town,\\" but will stand alone as one of the greats.  The songs will stand the test of time just like the band -emerging from the 2000's unscathed by trends or fads and continue to sell out arenas around the world.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I love the app, Its easy to use and read, but wished it would sync to my kindle for the folders and their contents.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|This movie lived up to my expectations. It was never boring or slow but very fast paced and entertaining. Many twists and turns kept the movie exciting and fun.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love, love, love this app. not one single complaint about it...aside from it's level of addiction ;-)<br />highly recommend this to everyone!
B003O86FMW|5.0|As with \\"The Hiunger Games\\" I couldn't put it down.  Great characters and more development of the characters of Katniss and Peeta and their relationship, as well as the political situation.
B000FC1K66|5.0|This engrossing story is about an intelligent boy of 15 and his 36 year old seductress whom he later discovers has been an SS security guard at a  Nazi gas chamber.  I have personal acquaintance with only two men who had similar experiences (minus the SS) and both lives have turned out badly, but in different ways. Is the well always poisoned? Did it really have anything to do with their later lives? Frankly I forget how Dustin Hoffman's future is suggested at the ending of \\"The Graduate;\\" I might want to watch him and Mrs. Robinson again sometime.  Bernard Schlink explores what happens in the soul of his young man and suggests what goes on  within the woman.  Somewhere he mentions the layers of human memory like tectonic plates pressed together so tightly that they are inescapably a part of us.  As someone has said, guilt is the gift that keeps on giving.  There is so much in this book of the \\"woulda, coulda, shoulda\\" sort of thing I can easily recommend it to my book club.  The discussion might never end.  I compliment Ms. Janeway on an excellent translation.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Excellent graphics. love the challenges. Each level offers a different strategy. Great job. Looking forward to the next set of games!!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This book is so good!!! I just love it, It is one of the best read's in a long  time!!!
B004XZR63M|4.0|A very interesting book from a different perspective.  The author expresses not so authentic ideas in a different light.  I think everyone can benefit from this book.
B00004WEJZ|3.0|It's good though, despite the mixed reviews. I also found it interesting to see Kim Basinger when she was thirty years old. Being an (ex) scholar on nuclear weapons made me giggle not a little for the awkward procedures and handling of the nukes... but heck it's a movie!<br /><br />A bit sad at the end of the movie to hear Connery, while kissing Kim Basinger, replying \\"Never again!\\" when an emissary of his boss asks him to go back to work as the service is not the same without him. Well so it was the final appearance of the best Bond ever!<br /><br />Missing at the beginning is the traditional gun barrel sequence, as this is (the only one) not produced by Eon Productions.
B000FC130E|5.0|Neil Gaiman's \\"Neverwhere\\" is an excellent, though dark, book with good characterizations, an excellent universe, and superb technical writing.  As with almost everything Gaiman writes, I found it totally engrossing.  And, even though it's not a humorous book, the standard Gaiman wit bursts through in various places.  Unfortunately, though it's got enough hooks and openings to support sequels, there doesn't appear to be any out there.  A shame.  But, on its own, I rate this at an Excellent 5 stars out of 5.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Excellent read with gear and training details. You get a sense you are there as they make their way to the compound and take down Osama. Worth a read just for the firsthand account and the list of gear and weapon systems a DEVGRU operator used.
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|This was the first graphic novel I've read and I loved it. I strongly recommend this book. Read it now!
B008EQIK90|3.0|Like most comidies today, the majority of the funniest parts of the movie were found in the previews. All-in-all, this was a very average-good movie, with a pretty weak story-line.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I LOVED this book.  Each chapter surprised me.  I was totally unable to figure out what was coming next. I really cared about the characters.
B0087HT36U|4.0|I found this game to be highly entertaining. The game may be easier than birds; but the game is also less fustrating than birds can be.  It does have a few bugs that need working out for the kindle.  Some levels kill the peasant before the weapons load. Other than that I really enjoyed the game and I'm looking foward to future levels.
B00006G8G1|4.0|Great show with a great setlist. Any DVD sells Maiden short from seeing them live. UP THE IRONS! NIKO MCBRAIN RULES!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|very fun keeps me entertained and when you want q game to play when your bored this is the game to play
B009AJD5E0|1.0|i am happy about being able to watch this video on instant queue how ever i am very disapointed that i can't download it to my computer's amazon unbox because it is a HD movie only so it has taken me 3 and 1/2 hours to watch this movie with all the buffering going on is very annoying please amazon fix this problem with your sucky instant queue
B008XG1X18|4.0|Was really excited to get this app on my Fire but having to restart it is a pain. Still glad to have it on my Fire though.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Enjoyed every page!  Buying three books at once was the way to go.  No waiting and found the story more interesting to move from one book to the next.
B0064Z7CI8|5.0|The remaster didn't make it sound different enough to where I really noticed much. I just heard the songs sparkle a bit more. The instrumentation was a bit more separated without losing the cohesiveness of the original. The demos are insanely interesting. Hearing what the songs sounded like before the final versions was cool. I loved the tunes that didn't make the cut. I did also hear why they didn't though. Listened to it once a day for the past month. Still listening.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I recently purchased both season 1 and 2 of Downton Abbey from Amazon. The series was AWESOME!! I have watched it numerous times since the purchase and also have gotten a couple of my friends hooked on it. I also enjoy the historical era that it takes place in. Worthwhile watching!
B00884GR0W|4.0|I love the game except its deleteing all my torches and my weapons. please fix this bug because I cant quest if my things keep vanishing
B008XG1X18|5.0|love having pinterest on kindle fire...it's great.......have been waiting for it to be available....very easy to use and convenient on the kindle fire
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm so glad it's available on my Kindle Fire!! Lots of great ideas, but be careful, it can be very addictive!
B008D28HYS|5.0|This game is perfect for those times when I just enjoy figuring things out without blowing them up. The levels start out easy but as soon as I work up to the harder levels I am having work a lot harder.  Also, all levels are available at all times which is pretty nice.  Love that it is in color.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is really hard to put down.  The first book took me a day in a half. I am a full time student and work part-time so it's really hard to find time to read a good book.
B008I3R2VG|5.0|Make sure to get the deluxe version, it contains the remix of \\"Flesh and Blood\\".  I am really enjoying this cd, and it has exceeded my expectations.  The Killers have grasped a synth sound and it reminds me of some of the best of the 80's.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|If you are a fan of their songs that are played on the radio then you'll love this CD. I can't believe I hadn't heard any of these songs before I bought the CD. Either way I can't stop listening to it now!
0452273331|1.0|I have read this book three times and each time I am more disappointed.  I really want to enjoy this novel, but, the writing is so dry, unimaginative and repetitive that I find it distracting.  Yes, I get her ideas on objectivism, but do I need to be told about them 700 times?  This is a bit like reading Mien Kampf in that I understand everything I need to know about the author's viewpoint in a 100 pages.<br /><br />Now, if the novel had beautiful prose, inspiring characters or an interesting story I might find it more enjoyable, but, the book is a didactic sledgehammer that makes me think of the worst aspects of propaganda.  Maybe some people need that type of repitition to understand something. Perhaps this book should have been an essay instead of a weak attempt at a novel.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|ok so far. new to kindle fire. wait till fishing season then we will see. right now it keeps me off my wife's back which she likes.
B004KZDV8E|5.0|The Core i3 processor is a great processor for the money. I haven't topped it out yet, and with so many programs not taking advantage of more than 2 cores yet, you aren't hurt but it being a dual core. I in fact switched from a Quad core AMD 2.5 GHz to this processor and got a huge bump in power.<br /><br />I have one criticism, make sure you buy an aftermarket CPU heatsink/cooler because the stock one is horrible.<br /><br />Idles at 35C at around 5% usage on both cores with two browsers open, a spreadsheet, Steam, IM app, antivirus running etc..
0345803507|5.0|This book was the best one of the trilogy. A real pager turner and kept me engaged . I never ever buy books
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This book seemed to drag on and the ending really caught me by surpries. Deffinately not the quality of the first two books. I would still recommend the series.
B0053O89XI|5.0|Pre ordered and thought it would arrive on release date, unfortunatly it arrived 6 days after the release date and had difficulty keeping my children from getting it at the store before it arrived at our house. It wsa in great shape, and we love the show and the convience of having it at our disposal.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book was a good compliment to the first book. It was fun reading and moved on fairly quickly. Deffinately lead you on to wanting to read the 3rd book asap
B003P2WO5E|5.0|A truly amazing beginning for Sandersons attempt at epic fantasy. He has taken what he learned from Elantris, Mistborn and WoT and crafted a bizarre world with stunning internal consistensy, and enough familiarity to allow readers to become totally immersed in the story within a couple chapters. Can't wait for the sequel.
B006LSZECO|3.0|While the beginning to middle of this book kept me fully interested, I must say the second half was a letdown.  It did not come across as believable.  The lenghts that this woman goes to seemed silly more than anything.  It did keep me guessing at times which I liked but this book could have been great had it not gone the direction it did.
B003O86FMW|1.0|I read all 3 of the Hunger Games books because my daughter enjoyed them and I kept hoping they would get better.  They did not.  In my opinion, a lot of to do about nothing.  A waste of money.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|An excellent read into the life of the men and women that put their life on the day after day for us. It is very disappointing, however when you read how the Washington politicians get in the way of these people doing their job.
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|The &quot;free&quot; download is a one level demo that just pesters you buy the full version constantly...but doesn't tell you the price.<br /><br />Controls are oddly delayed and take getting used to.  Items are in no way obvious in function. I didn't end up figuring out what most did.<br /><br />The place system is a bit (okay A LOT) buggy.  You'll go from first to 4th without seeing a single other racer pass you and all of a sudden be catching up to the group.<br /><br />Overall, its a poor Mario Kart knock-off.  I don't know what the full version costs, but its not even worth $0.99.
B008H6GH8I|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR SOME IDIOT PEDO TO SHOW TO KIDS LOCKED IN A VAN, IN A DARK PARKING LOT THEN THE KIDS GET SCARED, S*** THIER PANTS AND WRECK THE VAN TRYING TO GET OUT AWAY FROM IT
B003YL4LYI|4.0|This book did drag moreso than the previous four books and I did not care for the turns the story made in some parts. While I dont expect every story line to appease me after reading thousands of a story it is dissapointing for a quick and seemingly hurried ending hopefully the next book will be more pleasing.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I commend the author of No Easy Day...for his firsthand true story of how actually Bin Laden was killed and the courage to write his account of this historic feat. The author gives us the detailed training and dedication needed to become a Navy Seal to be able to carry out a dangerous mission he was called upon to do. I recommend this book to everyone to wants to know the true happenings and not the facts given to us via the media, etc.
0345803485|1.0|Why is this book a big deal?!! I had more fun reading the bad reviews than reading this book! To me it will remain a mystery book,why was it on bookshelves?
B004UID2LC|1.0|I got this to watch shows but it would not download so lisend to me do not get this app you will regret it
B009AMAK0E|5.0|In September movie studios generally release their small box office films that may be successful or not as many are not going to the theatre as in previous times of the years. The films during the fall are usually known as \\"sleepers\\" and are quick to be forgotten as Hollywood gears up for their next big round of film releases for the Holidays.<br /><br /> In \\"Trouble with the Curve\\" Clint Eastwood plays an aging scouter well past 80 who finds his eye sight is getting worse and he realizes that he may not be able to do what he did once: to find the best baseball players around. On the advice of a friend (played by John Goodman) his daughter (beautifully portrayed by Amy Adams) decides to escort her father to North Carolina on his latest round of scouting activity. There they meet Johnny (Justin Timberlake) who is a fellow scouter of Gus' (the Eastwood character) and he immediately falls in love with Gus' daughter.<br /><br /> The material may sound heavy (someone going blind is tough story for audiences to digest), but in \\"Trouble with the Curve\\" there is humor, an intelligent script and some of the finest performances by a supporting cast in a movie. Clint is also exceptiional even at 82 years of age and proves his acting is still some of the best.<br /><br /> On its first weekend of release the movie made $12.1 million coming in 3rd for the week.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Great app. Addictive! I downloaded it thinking I would try it out, but ive ended up on it at least once a day everyday.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|No Easy Day chronicles one member of Seal Team 6's experience, in preparing for and conducting the raid on Osama Bin Laden's compound in Pakistan.<br />While much can be said about a member of a special forces unit violating the vow and code of secrecy taken when engaging in this profession, our government too participated in leaking and revealing it's role in this event.  The best that might be said is that both parties took the opportunity for self gain, and a debate about who can and for what purposes are such actions ever justified might be of further interest to some.<br />The author speaks to the audience in first person, revealing his observations about the build up to the mission however continually asserts the claim that he is not revealing anything that either has not been revealed before or that the information is not classified.  Clearly the author has much reverence for his fellow teammates and the Navy Seals in general (in particular the elite Team 6 members), and to a point appears to make them to seem bigger than life.  Under scrutiny, I think that is would be a fair statement to say that these are talented guys, who are doing a job that they sought out and competed to get. Much information is shared about the rigors of becoming a Seal, and the intensity of the training.  The story is interesting and moves along pretty well, although some great detail about daily training gets a bit redundant.  Surprisingly many operational errors and confusion occurred in the raid on the Bin Laden compound, and it appears that the success was primarily due to the reluctance on the part of the bad guys in being prepared to defend and taking aggressive counter measures to combat the threat.  Based on the information in the book, a well guarded and aggressive protective group at the compound may well have significantly changed the outcome of this raid. This is a good book and will probably fill in some gaps in most readers questions/beliefs about covert operations andUS special forces.
B005IQZB14|5.0|What a hero!  Can't believe what she went through to complete her journey.  Not sure I have the moxie to do something similar.  Very inspirational
B0017I1IZA|5.0|Janet Evanivich's Hard Eight is one of her best novels...love Evanovich and love her Stephanie Plum series! I can't put these books down!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Slammed follows Colleen Hoover's characters from Point of Retreat. These books are a true love story that survive all obstacles. I highly recommend both books.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was even better than the first! I could not put it down, and had the entire book read in a weekend.
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|Challenging fun and makes you think.  Keeps your math skills up to date.  Would be good for kids to.practice addition
B0006HJEMC|3.0|Product was smaller than I had anticipated.  Size of 1/12 was given but for me it did not tell me much as I dont work models. However, My Grandson being a titanic fan will love it as a gift for his birthday.  Delivery from this company was excellent.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|It was obvious Mark was witholding classified information but the event was historically accurate and a must read for Patriots.
B0053TMP24|5.0|What a.book none like it! i love this book so.much i have to read it over and over. loooove it!
B00932A2MC|5.0|Man oh man. Am I glad we rented this movie !  We were glued to the screen from st art to finish. Fabulous alien shoots. Looked very real.
B0087HT36U|5.0|this game is very much like one of my favorites, angry birds. if you like problem solving and destruction, then this game is perfect for you.
B009AJD5E0|2.0|Even when discounting the hype, this movie was poorly written. By far, this was the worst movie I have seen that Ridley Scott had anything to do with. I doubt I would ever watch it again. Did Hollywood screw up another great series?<br /><br />The dialogue alone is extremely amateur, and I kept finding it hard to imagine the characters as professionals, scientists, etc. Many times, the characters' logic, or ability to reason was non-existent. Also note, there was absolutely NO Fear Factor. The commercials I saw for this this movie prior to release were very misleading, as they tried to make it 'appear' as a Sci-Fi Thriller or Scary movie, which it is not. Maybe the joke was on me, but some other viewers I have spoken to feel the same way. I suppose I made the mistake of rushing to the theater the day it premiered without waiting for any feedback.<br /><br />The plot started out with some great creativity, bringing a completely new takes on aliens, but feel apart quickly. The few attempts at a witty twist during the story and the end fizzled. Numerous attempts to be smart, funny, strong or scary with these characters failed. This is one movie where I wish hadn't wasted my time and money at the theater.<br /><br />Story: 2<br />Acting: 2<br />Dialogue: 1<br />Action: 2<br />Fear Factor: 2
B005K0HDGE|3.0|captivating content or craft. This is not Stephen King's best effort. Dyed or died in the wool King fans may find the premise facinating. I found the story to be a bit like \\"Ground Hog Day\\". Sorry Stephen, this looks like the precursor to an up coming PG-13 movie. Am I right? Please refrain from sending me a copy of the trailer.
B00992CF6W|5.0|great game im so glad they finnaly  came out with it on kindle fire its not as good as o  the pc but is still very awesome
B003BW0CB6|4.0|I like the book. The plot was okay. I like the main characters fine, Fierce Maggie is great. Mickey Haller is generally okay but engages in too much self psychoanalysis -- too much self doubt. If you're going to be a \\"slimy\\" defense attorney then be one and quit defending your chosen profession through the entire intercourse. Other than that, Connelly is a consistent talent and it shows.
B003O86FMW|5.0|IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE SOMEONE GOOD WRITE OR HAVE THESE WORDS TO WRITE THIS BOOK.....LOT OF PAIN....HOWEVER I DID LIKE THE READ...I READ ALL THE BOOKS  AND AM GLAD IT CAME OUT THE WAY I WAS HOPING IT WOULD....
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|an entertaining movie-a bit over the top for my taste-had the feel of something Tim Burton directed-Jennifer Lawrence is a great actress
B008F5YDRI|5.0|Stunning photography in this movie - cetaily worth the extra for the bluray version. I'm sure that they used some footage of Pacific salmon in places - but I won't hold that against them! I'm not too worried that it strays from the book - the movie is a Pacific Salmon whilst the book is an Atlantic Salmon; similar but the cogniscenti recognise the quality of the original and can enjoy it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Have not read Stephen King in years - a friend recommended this book so I bought it.  I had a hard time putting it down - brought back so many memories. My high school band played for President Kennedy in Houston the night before he was shot.  I highly recommend this book, especially for long plane flights.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Quell Reflect had me up late into the night trying to solve the puzzles.  It is a wonderful puzzle to improve logic and problem solving skills.  I felt like I was getting smarter with every puzzle I solved.
B006TLFPKO|5.0|The movie followed the book very close.  Of course it could not build characters and scenes the way the book does, but for someone who has read all of the books, I knew what was going on.  Good job
B006LSZECO|2.0|I can see a movie in the making for this book but people who have read the book will surely not to pay money for the movie unless the second half is rewritten.  It was totally unbelievable.
B004AUGJS8|3.0|I just wish movies would have more defined endings now.  It seems that it is in vogue to leave a hanging ending.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|fun mind numbing coins dozing action and yeah that's about all I have to say about that game awes yeah.<br />fart
0062197258|5.0|Couldn't wait to get back to this book at the end of the day. A very good read.  I also loved the way two different time periods were written, and that I didn't have to struggle to figure out which one I was reading .
B003O86FMW|4.0|Very engaging and entertaining, good lead to the next book.  Hard to put down, but you don't wanna rush it.
0307352145|3.0|As the author herself explains at the beginning of the book, introverts are not necessarily socially quiet. 'Shy' and 'introvert' is not psychologically the same.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|the book was really good.  It kept my interest from beginning to end.  I would definitely recommend this book from pre-teens t adults.  It has something for everyone.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|A great read. Didn't want to put it down. Who wouldn't want to go back in time and change the course of history, or just go back in time. Stephen King at his best.
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|Still a good read for Reacher fans but this book is not as punchy as some of the earlier books. Reacher is getting older & it shows.
B008MG1E4A|2.0|This book was a disappointment.  It had no finesse, no charm.  There was no character development to evoke empathy. It described weaponry using \\"insider\\" terminology and read more as an instruction manual than anything else.  Perhaps I expected too much.

I saw the original band when they were young and at their peak, and this album has some great songs on it. I cod be wrong but check it out!
0806930152|5.0|This book is an incredibly helpful reference book. It totally helps art students to become better at the anatomical study and to understand the differences of each part of the body. I have owned so much many others anatomy books and this is by far the best one. I will always go back to Bridgman.
B005JR3Y5W|5.0|Love, love, love \\"New Girl.\\"  I needed a good laugh out loud moment, and this show provided many of them.  Zooey Deschanel is adorable, and the rest of the cast is very funny.  I recommend this, highly, and I can't wait for season 2.

B004HYDL1K|2.0|Danny's performance in Desperado was more \\"down to earth\\" and entertaining than his role in Machete.  Yes, action, violence, and gratuity sex are in this film; however, the director makes Danny take the action to beyond earth heights and far into fantasy. Attempts to suspend disbelief does nothing to regard Danny's knife scenes beyond comical or at best on a par with the wonderous flying martial arts actors who blithly skip on water in Chinese films.  Danny is a solid character actor who deserves a better director. The film will make one question their blood lust motives.
B0068LYEHA|1.0|I hardly made it past a quarter of the book before I threw it away.  It was unnecessarily-grossly-sexually explicit.  I am old enough where I guess I already know how to be a woman.<br /><br />I would indeed liked to have known what trash this book was and how explicit it was before I paid good money for it only to throw it in the trash.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|I just ordered my third Hyper 212 Plus. I was so impressed with the cooling ability on the first 2 computers I installed it on I would not use any other air cooler.  I have seen reviewers complaining about the size.  The size is stated in the description of the cooler. If it doesn't fit your case then why did you buy it? All the good air coolers are BIG. I think it is important to buy a good thermal paste. Google \\"thermal paste review\\" and read the reviews. There is a big differece. Why spend big bucks on a CPU and other parts and skimp on a less than $10 thermal paste? If you look at the reviews of this cooler on different sites, you will find the majority are excellent. MaximumPC has rated it their top pick for an air cooler for years.  You can find coolers that might cool a degree ar two less but cost $60 to $90. The price to cooling abilty make it a no brainer. On Amazon I just paid $25 including shipping.....now that is a deal!!
B001B3MCQK|5.0|I saw the documentary about Sixto Rodriguez, \\"Searching for Sugarman.\\" The soundtrack is the music from his two albums. I loved the songs all the way through, bought both cd's, and have been listening to them almost daily.  His music is like a mix of Bob Dylan, Jackson Browne, and Jim Croce, maybe with a bit of Traffic too. See the movie. You'll be moved by the music and his story.

B006H5120E|4.0|Since Cameron is a pioneer of 3D, I was expecting more, but try as I might with the settings on my so far perfect Panasonic plasma, I couldn't get it anywhere close to my other 3D discs. The 2D blu ray faired better and was remastered well. One thing I did like about the 3D though, I can just go to the exciting part on disc 2, and disable 3D.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Easy and fun game; but once you use all your coins and cash in your prizes; you have to wait 30 sec. for a free coin or stop playing for a while to gain more free coins or purchase more.  I'm doing this review just so I can earn free coins in the 30 sec wait time.  Have fun:)
B000FC1MM8|4.0|This is another good read with Harry Bosch as the talented but troubled LA detective.  It has been two or three years since I last read one of this series and I had a nagging feeling that I had read this one before.  It turns out that I hadn't but it also demonstrates that the main character has rather predictable plots.  Still, I was entertained and the story filled in some of the Bosch's past.
B007SGM084|5.0|I love these books.  I read the first one and could not wait for the second and third.  I was loaned book one and immediately bought the trilogy.  The books are so much deeper than what you hear.  Yes there is a lot of sex, but the books are so much more! The story and the relationship between Christian and Ana is riveting.

SORRY!<br />This is a must have for all MJ lovers. its a remembrance of the time where music was appreciated and loved. and MICHAEL JACKSON is the only person who makes music alive in this world. WE LOVE YOU MICHAEL ! FOREVER!
B006ZDU7QI|4.0|How did this become a hit?  Surprised at how much I like it.  Highly recommended and in my top 5 this year so far.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love it. I can choose the size of the puzzle pieces I want; and the double tapping to rotate the pieces work for me. just wish they had more opptions for puzzleui
B008MG1E4A|5.0|VERY INTERESTING. I HAD NO IDEA HOW HARD THEY TRAINED BEFORE A MISSION. I DISCOVERED THE INFORMATION THAT WAS TOP SECRET. OBL DYED HIS BEARD WITH \\"JUST FOR MEN. LOL
B008JGSM6G|5.0|challenging! and goes easy on some levels but then makes you use a lot of strategy. love strategy games? This is for you!
B008C20TDG|4.0|It was a little tough to buy all the \\"science-y\\" stuff, but several people at the church I am a member of are doing the Whole30 so I thought I would give it a try.  The book is well written and easy to understand.  The recipies in the back are great!!!
1446301583|5.0|A very cute book with creative ideas, pictures and great pattern for you to make. Another great book to my creative collections.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|The second I started reading this book I was hooked.  The author is so \\"right on\\" about time and how it relates to different people.  Very, very clever writing, unbelievable how it all came together in the end.  I loved the characters, and I now have a new understanding and appreciation for Father Time.  I was fascinated by the old man Victor and the young girl Sarah's stories, they were very believable, very interesting, and so sad.  It was a lovely book, there was alot to think about, I couldn't wait to see how it ended and I was not disappointed.  Another great book by Mitch Albom...I loved it!!
0345803493|5.0|Exactly as I said, it's like crack! Can't put it down. Stopped sleeping, stopped laundry, stopped cleaning my house. My poor kids had to fend for themselves, lol!( they are old) It won't earn any award for writing but it will for entertainment! The only thing is I just can't see how they will turn this into a movie. Keep reading the next book really has a story line. Once again may I suggest Ann Rice's Claiming of Sleeping Beauty series.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|As the levels go up, the puzzles become more challenging..the background music is so calm and elegant.it really helps in focusing more on the puzzle.I think this game could help increasE you're concentration
0345803485|5.0|Why do you all think this book is so terrible. Anyway I have never read the Twilight series so I have nothing to be angry about there. I am a 32 year old mom and I find this fantasy is spot on with me. I love this book so much that I hope when I die I go to Fifty Shades of Grey Heaven! I find that the BDSM is actually too soft for me. I have always wanted to get into this stuff. Anyways, this is a total fantasy so if you think the plot is too unreal get over it. It's suppose to be unreal, that's what a fantasy is! If you stop at the first book you really miss the whole story line. So don't stop here. If you like this book please please please read Ann Rice's Claiming of Sleeping Beauty series, you will thank me later. To me reading this book was like my own personalized porno that I got to make up in my head for days and days. I read a lot and I never reread books but I will make an acception with this series. I can't wait untill Christian's viewpoint of the story comes out! Geezs have fun with it and don't be so Vanilla!
B001GUXJQA|5.0|The Black Ice was filled with mystique, a real page turner.  Many twists and<br />turns and outcomes I would never have expected.  Written in such a way that you<br />can actually feel the character's emotion and concern.  I am a Harry Bosch fan<br />and as usual, I am always looking for the next Michael Connelly book.
0345803507|5.0|I read these books in a week. back to back. My poor kids, I was so addicted I stopped sleeping, cleaning, cooking, laundry, and I didn't take a shower for days. Addictive does not even come close to what these books were for me. I was sad when they ended.I beg for the Red Room of Pain!!! Can't wait to read this from Christian's point of view! Once again my I suggest Ann Rice's Claiming of Sleeping Beauty\\".
B0094KF4WG|5.0|Read the book. It's informative and thrilling. There is no fluff and a thorough account. Its just how it must have been. Very honest and a nice crisp style of writing taking the reader through it all. But there are no startling revelations. So do not expect any. Except the inside to the training of SEALS. the methods and exercises were interesting .
B004LQI0HE|3.0|I enjoyed the movie but I adored the book. If I hadn't read the book I probably would have rated the movie higher. I spent a lot of viewing time missing the parts that were left out.<br />However, the cast was engaging and the movie was well done and certainly covered a very ineresting subject that was unique.
B0084I9QI2|5.0|I love being able to relive the BAD Concert - the last show I saw him performing live (was lucky enough to see him live in later years but not on stage).  I even liked the authentic VHS look of the show - took me back to old times watching countless hours of MJ specials on my videotapes!<br /><br />I love Fly Away,So Blue and Todo Mi Amor Eres Tu. Streetwalker is catchy but not new to me since it's on the videogame, the Michael jackson Experience.<br /><br />Great collection...well worth the purchase which includes a mini-poster, 2 books, live audio of the concert and a sticker.
B0018GRAE4|4.0|The cd flows together really well. If you like five finger death punch then I would get this album! My favs are the bleeding and never enough...
B00555X8OA|5.0|This book is a must read for everyone!  The concepts covered in this book will help you improve your understanding of yourself and others.
B007AJFSJW|5.0|A marvel of understandability, Krugman once again puts difficult economic problems into plain English.  His explanation of current problems is based on an understanding of macroeconomics in the real world, and not on the classic economic constructs that ignore externalities.  His recommendations for actiion are Keynesian, not conservative, but real world examples very well support his argument.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|This is an interesting journey through unresolved grief and self-discovery with no holds barred honesty. I almost didn't choose to read this because of the book being \\"Oprah's book club\\", but I'm glad I did read it.  Any young person dealing with unresolved grief who discovers themselves to be self-reliant through physical trial would be encouraged to read this book.
B0058PJ6NE|4.0|Umm.....This application is very nice yarr.  I just loved it. Hey it is a good application. I recommend to download this app.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|it would have been nicer to have a way to wary more coins faster. but besides. that it was an excellent game.
B006HTUZ1C|4.0|Interface looks a bit dated, but it's extremely fun and stimulating. Would pay for if I hadn't gotten it free.
B008GANNIC|4.0|Over all, album was good musically & by way of message. My problem is with the last song \\"I Am\\". Colossians 3:8 says, \\" But now you must also rid yourselves of all such things as these: anger, rage, malice, slander, and ( filthy language from your lips ).\\" NIV. This is written to Christians. Paul said that we were (in) the world not of it. The album was like climbing into a race car, hitting the gass & enjoying the speed! Then you hot a brick wall! Message is clouded by the F bomb.  3 stars would have been a better score.
0765316994|4.0|Scalzi is a pretty innovative novelist, but this thing is just weird and strange, and also difficult to describe. It's also very, very funny -- especially if you're old enough to have been a Star Trek veteran. Ensign Andy Dahl has just been appointed to a science post aboard the Intrepid, flagship of the Universal Union's huge starship fleet, and several other young officers come aboard at the same time, all of them destined to become friends. They assume that taking part in \\"away missions\\" -- investigating the flora and fauna of newly discovered planets, responding to distress calls from various colonies, engaging in diplomacy with alien worlds -- will be an interesting and adventurous part of their work, but they get warned off this activities pretty quickly by the older hands on the ship. Being a junior crewman and a new guy on such a mission, especially when it also involves one or more of the five senior officers on the ship, makes you disposable. It virtually guarantees you'll get killed -- by a sand worm, if not an ice shark. And Decks 6 through 12 will always take the most damage when the ship is attacked. Dahl studies the statistics and concludes (with some help from his friends) that there's only one explanation -- and they have to somehow change things, and fast, if they want to survive.<br /><br />I find it amazing that Scalzi could successfully produce such an exciting and action-filled yarn with his tongue so firmly in his cheek, but he does. And he has some more serious things to say, too, regarding personal relationships and the duties of a writer. This one is a must-read, and not just for Trekkies.
B001AOKA3W|1.0|it was a movie that sucked and had no real special effects are meaning the title of the movie gives it know justice it was a waste of money and time making that movie and i payed $3.99 for that what a waste
B006LSZECO|3.0|First of all, I probably wouldn't have picked up this book and read it on my own. It was assigned as a book club book for my book club so I bought it for my kindle and started reading. I would have to say, if I hadn't know I'd have to talk about it I probably would have stopped reading halfway through the first 'book'. I found the entire first section of this book hard to get into and kind of dull after a while, and I must say I could see where the book was going halfway through that section (although I definitely didn't know the motives behind it). The second book picks things up and I began to enjoy the book a little more (still just not my type of book), and the 3rd book definitely piqued my interest. However, after spending forever reading this (it's not a short book and I am a fast reader) I felt highly disappointed in the ending. I do understand the authors reasoning for it, but it leaves the reader feeling disappointed and kind of dejected by the whole book. I will never read it again for sure, but if you a fan of thrillers then go for it you may enjoy it more than me.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Strange story and very suspenseful chapters. Kept my  attention. Couldn't wait until I read the final chapter.<br />Would recommend this book to people who like mysteries.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Though I am glad I finished the series, I must say I was less than satisfied with the conclusion. Even though it was well written, I just got tired of the death and hurt the characters endured.  I'm a sucker for a happy ending I guess.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|I just finished SofC today and it was a breathtaking experience. They simply don't make games like these anymore which are unique and story driven to a point where you really care about the characters. The scale of this game, soundtrack and graphical presentation immerse you in this world a lot more than the NEW* games with better graphics do. Its mindbogglingly this was done on a ps2 such an old console, I believe that with a graphical power that ps3 is capable of we don't need next generation for years to come we just need games which bring unique experiences to the gaming community. We haven't gotten many unique games this generation except perhaps yakuza, little big planet, maybe Tokyo Jungle is game that is going to feel fresh. Truth is next generation is going bring game development price even higher and is going to further eliminate any creativity in games as long as only high profile games (COD, UNCHARTED, GTV and so on) are only ones which succeed and make millions and investors see that those games which do sell millions in 1 day can only be considered as success.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I like to pass time with these puzzles.  there is just the right amount of challenge and reward.  The jigsaw ones are not as good IMHO.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|really great game.  sort of bothersome how many times the same areas had to be revisited and researched for hidden objects, but overall a very entertaining and well made game.
B005LAIIRQ|1.0|A paycheck for Liam Neeson ... but a waste of time for viewers.<br />There's no real plot except to make Liam Neeson look like \\"the man\\".<br />He knows it all, he will beat up anyone who does not see thing the same way he does.<br />And then some kind of mystical connection to nature and the wolves ... he has<br />why ... from shooting them.<br /><br />Not point to this, no reason to see it ... no wonder it popped up on NetFlix for free.
B00866H7SS|3.0|It was a good read overall.  I could have done with a bit more suspense however.  The way the book eneded wanted me to find out what happens next and that's why i have already pre-ordered.  If you are looking for an easy going book to read, than this is the one for you!
B008H6GH8I|5.0|In general, it improves greatly from the last CG film - Degeneration. The graphic runs so smooth and in great details, which you can have an insight in the special features. Those breathe taking actions are just as great as big Hollywood movies and the concept of the last action scene has never been used in any of RE games, nor in the Hollywood made RE movies. Together with action packed is some humors which is enjoyable. This movie was also available in 3D in theatre, which I believe only available in Japan or some very limited cities which should be a great bonus
B008DM4OTA|5.0|My 7 year old and 3 year old both love to play this game.  Got the free version 1st, but since they loved it so much I got the paid version.  Well worth the money!
B000000OQ5|5.0|Very good cd it has all very good songs on if ,  It is one of those music cd's that you can listen too and never get tiered of it.<br />I would highly recommend this to anyone that is a tesla fan. I would give this cd a rating of five.
B004J64QSI|5.0|The 25th anniversary show, even though the sets were minimal, was an incredible musical experience.  With singers from 4 different casts and a huge choir, the music was just extraordinary.  At the end of the production, the actors who have played Jean Valjean over the years, including Kolm Wilkinson from the very first production, joined together to sing an incredibly emotional \\"Bring Him Home\\" - it was just unbelievably emotional and beautiful.
0439023521|5.0|Great book, great product, great experience! I watched the movie and enjoyed it so much that I had to buy the book. I was not disappointed.
B003521R6G|5.0|Classic.  Feel Good Movie that Never goes out of style!  Raw, energetic movie.  Every actor and actress was perfect for their part.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I have only played it for twenty minutes and I'm already addicted! everyone should get this app. You won't be dissapointed
B006671NPM|1.0|While the movie was great, the Flixster & UltraViolet is just horrible.  While I was able to load it into my Flixster account, when I linked my UltraViolet account, it disappeared.  When I tried to re-add it, I was over my limit.  Tonight I wasted four hours creating accounts for Sony, Universal, UltraViolet, and Flixster.  Lots, and lots, and lots of aggravation.  If am stunned that this product every made it through beta testing.  I wrote Flixster and still am waiting to hear back.  If I don't get anything by the end of the week, I will ditch Flixster and UltraViolet... never to be tried again.<br /><br />If anyone from Flixster or UltraViolet read this, I would encourage you to look at Amazon or iTunes.  Real easy to use.  To anyone buying this and thinking you are going to watch this on anything but your TV... good luck.
B000SEGUDE|3.0|Large parts of the begining and end were so so. The middle part that took place in Korea was the best. The inventive use of the languages was delightful and fascinating.
0345803485|1.0|\\"50 Shades of Grey\\" is absolutely terrible. You can find much better erotica than this for free on the internet. Seriously, just google \\"fanfic\\" and go to town. EL James has no real knowledge of BDSM (and possibly sex) and in fact, the relationship she describes is not \\"kinky,\\" it's abusive. If you're interested in BDSM, run far far away from this book. It's awful and so bad it's not entertaining, it's just sad.<br />Especially the obsession with orange juice. What's up with that?
B001NKI60W|4.0|An enjoyable film from a musical standpoint but the plot well......not knowing which of 3 men is the father of your child is ridiculous. I felt the acting and the pace was overzealous for a movie. I can see that for the stage but movies need a bit more realism, or at least that is my opinion. I thought Amanda Seigfield did very well. I would have liked to have given this film 3 1/2 stars.
B00992CF6W|5.0|omg the best best thing ever to hit the face of this planet finally here I have a kindle and it was so hard to find a good app like minecraft other than block story
B002E0JL4A|5.0|If you've never watched this movie yet, it's a must see movie. True story that is inspiring and moving.<br />Please check it out, sit back and have some laughs and tears!
0307352145|5.0|Finally, in Quiet: The Power of Introverts, I feel like someone understands me.  I am 72 years old and have had to put up with people who think that because I don't chatter, I am stupid or can't possibly understand and they feel they have to explain everything to me.  I know as much or more.And I know when they are wrong but I don't correct them.  Let them figure it out.
B008XG1X18|5.0|it makes pinterest viewing a breeze! I can now see pinterest at ease... at my finger tips! Love it. I use it daily
B005PK553C|5.0|Sat up and watched the entire season in one sitting.... cant wait to do it again and looking forward to Season 2 American horror Story: Asylum which Premieres on my Birthday October 17th<br /><br />Thanks Amazon for helping me get caught up on the series
B000JJSRNY|5.0|A  magnificant concert in an awe-inspiring setting with Placido Domingo and Rolando Villazon on superb form, Anna Netrebko quite sensational in the Lippen sie kussen so heis, I was on my feet cheering. Worth every penny., DVD from Amazon.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Highly recommended purchase!  Not to over sell the game, but I like this game almost more than Angry Birds.  Great game mechanics and beautiful graphics.
B008D28HYS|2.0|After downloading and installing this game on my tablet, I tried to play it but I couldn't figure out how it worked.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|I use it all the time because I never remember the names of songs.  I am starting to win at SongPop!
B00005OWIU|5.0|After tremendous success composing soundtracks for such blockbusters as 'Jaws', the 'Star Wars' films, 'Superman', 'Jurassic Park', and the 'Indiana Jones' films, why should we be surprised that movie soundtrack legend John Williams was commissioned to write the score for the movie that introduced us to that most popular boy wizard of Hogwarts - Harry Potter? No other composer comes close to creating such a marvelous soundtrack for the big-screen introduction to Harry in 'Harry Potter & the Sorcerer's Stone'.<br /><br />The soundtrack starts out softly with a marvelous string & tinkling bells theme as we are introduced to little Harry and the magic begins. 'Visit to the Zoo and Letters from Hogwarts' employs an enjoyable string & brass motif as Harry's annoying, spoiled cousin (?) has a nasty run-in with a snake, and the snowy owl brings Harry letters from Hogwarts which his arrogant, annoying uncle (?) tries desperately to conceal, only to have more and more appear. 'The Quidditch Match' appropriately employs a style for which Williams has become famous for his work in 'Star Wars' and 'Indiana Jones' - fast-moving, rapidly paced strings, brass & percussion as Harry plays that famous game using the broom. 'The Face of Voldemort' also reveals the darkest side of the Harry Potter series; a dark, threatening sound meant to depict a young boy confronting his greatest fear - and enemy.<br /><br />Once again, John Williams shows why he's a true master of the soundtrack. It's a shame he wasn't able to score all the films in the series; they would have greatly benefited from his work.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|It's an excellent account of what really happened, not what we were fed to believe by the government or the media !
B00825921I|5.0|This is a great read from start to finish. Daphne du Maurier is a master of story telling. Great settings and story line.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|The Journal of Adam Ewing is tough to read at first, but once you get through it, you fly through the rest of the book while experience a wide range of emotions. Absolutely spectacular.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great account of not only the mission but also insight into Seal Team 6. Well written. No secrets were divulged. I don't know why such a big deal was made of that.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|Really enjoyed reading this book. Recommended to anyone trying to  get rid of some nasty habit or taking on good ones  . Fast to read.
B006IDG2T6|3.0|Harris is an interesting writer but he is a bit inconsistent in his reasoning. He should have put a little more effort to define and explain the concept of \\"free\\" in free will. As he state it I'm seem to be free to make a decision but not free to make a choice.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|now see what you have done got me tangled. up with this game.  just like the real one only smaller.  its a fun crazy game.
B007EZJKS2|5.0|I have been a fan of The Last Unicorn since I was a child. I was introduced to the movie before I was five, and watched it so often that I could still quote the whole thing from memory. Then, when I was 11, I read the book, and it was weird and cool for my fifth grade brain and the subject of my very first book report. I still remember both with a great deal of happy nostalgia. With this in mind, I went looking for something for my Kindle Fire.<br /><br />The bad: Like all adaptations, a lot is condensed. While the art helps provide context, I felt the story presented was quite disjointed. Only my knowledge of the film and the book helped me piece bits together because there was very little sense of continuity. Of course, given the source material, this was something hard to do anyways. The Last Unicorn is a story that thrived on being a deconstruction of a fairy tale. You aren't allowed to slip into full suspension of disbelief unless it wants you to.<br /><br />The good: The art is beautiful. It evokes the film and is quite capable of standing on its own at the same time, and the full splash pages are nicely framed and constructed, lacking the mess you get in some comics. One thing I will quite happily note is the utter LACK of broken spines on the female characters, one of my major objections to some of IDWs art in the past. There is also enough of the oddities and general weirdness from the book that was cut out of the movie to keep any book purist happy.<br /><br />Overall, I give this a high rating for a combination of striking, beautiful art and being a sort of 'extended cut' of the movie, involving just enough of Beagle's poetic prose and imagery to invoke the book.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Great book, exciting plot! The story really hit its high point in this book. I am very excited to read the next two books and see where the story goes on from here. The pacing in this series is faced paced and exciting. with a little humor thrown in... There is never a dull point and the author does a great job of expressing each characters emotions. If you liked the first two books, then this one will definitely be a favorite!
B006LR0XLM|5.0|Best cloud service there is!!! Easy to install and use. Start using right away. Give you the possibility to increase your cloud space by refering it to your friends,
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app is great if you have a divice that wont tell you the battery life than this is good for you I says exactly how much battery life you have it os great get the app there is a lot to this app:D
B000V63BN6|5.0|Great collection of all the songs I remember hearing on the radio growing up. Got my kids listening to it and they like it, too.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Riveting....read it in 2 days and it only took that long because I dozed off at 1AM with my Kindle in hand.  Great details that paint a much clearer picture of the \\"how\\" and the planning of the story.  It would make a great Movie.
B005DOJ68K|5.0|I didn't even know I liked that many songs from them. The collection is jam packed with their music. If you just think you know a couple of their songs (like) me, check this album out and you may find more to like.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I thought this was very touching. I was crying by the end! I didnt want it to be over. I loved how it was writen in the form of letters
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|I enjoyed it very much, a bit scary in parts<br />but I 'd See it again. Everyone played their parts<br />Well.
B00004YRQA|5.0|The memory card works perfectly new out of the box. There isn't much you can say. Long live the PS2!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I played this type of game before and yes it can be boring, but it is still Fun! I do like the game!
B006HTUZ1C|3.0|To be truly &quot;awesum&quot;, allow the sum to be made up of more than just 2 cubes.  Also, horizontal sums should be allowed.<br /><br />Maybe throw in an option to make a particular block a &quot;minus&quot; block?  And the ability to split up block pairs?
B008MG1E4A|5.0|As a recent collector of military history that I've been involved in, or around, or that effects my life, I've collected works on the invasion of Iraq, the hunt for Saddam, how Clinton continually let Bin Laden evade the reach of the US, I was anxious to read NO Easy Day.  I bought the other book about the raid that released last year (?), written by a former SEAL based on \\"interviews\\".  Bullsh*t.  There was a good, well written section of the history of Bin Laden and his rise to power, but the story of the actual raid was pretty weak.  And, if you compare these two books, pretty inaccurate, as well.<br />That being said, with all the hoopla over this book, I wanted it.  I searched for it on the day of release, afraid that the current administration would eventually get the book pulled.  Couldn't find it in paper form, so I ordered the E book.  Read it in a day.  Later found the book in paper form, and bought it again.  The story is well written, history is accurate and precise, and I didn't see anything I didn't know security wise I didn't know already.<br />The book is a page turner, to be sure, and it's grateful to read that he doesn't appear to be a glory hound, giving credit where it's due where ever he can.<br />I can't recommend this book any higher.  I would buy a copy just to put on a shelf so my kids will have an access to history that they won't learn of by any other means in today's society, or in their biased schools.<br />Great read!
B008MJC6ZS|5.0|This is an excellent album from Testament.  I bought the vinyl (see the pics that I uploaded) and it is awesome to look at, but even better to listen to.  I've been a fan of the band since the late 80's and their sound on this record is as good as they've ever been.  The cover tunes they included are great as well.  if you're thinking about buying, then stop thinking and pull the trigger.  you won't be disappointed.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Well-written, disturbing but interesting and many twists and turns. A must-read. You will stay up all night to finish it!
B0083H6AQA|4.0|Great movie.  Robert Pattinson is as handsome as ever. All the actors were wonderful as is the music and costuming.
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|Fun game but it simply refuses to rotate blocks on screen tap at least half the time. I've given up playing. AT&T Note / ICS 4.0.4.<br /><br />-- EDIT 10/19/12:  I just installed the new version, and the touch controls are working perfectly on the Note.
B005IQZB14|5.0|What a great book. We read this for book club and it was a very inspiring story. I would highly recommend this book and the fact that this was inpired by her real life journey just leaves me in awe. I dont know that I would have had the fortitude to not only start the journey, but to complete it.Wow...
B003F5NSTW|3.0|There is no doubt this is an incredibly intelligent and well written book. It is utterly convincing in its portrayal of human foibles and our capacity to love. It also carefully takes us round the edge of our humanity carefully pointing out where we, and others, may leap off. Towards the end I found it incredibly hard to go back to it each evening. I'm glad I've read it, but I wouldn't read it again I think, but let this take nothing away from a remarkable feat of writing.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|We love this series.  It is truly a breath of fresh air from the violence that we usually see on TV.  It is done in good taste and an interesting way that is entertaining WITHOUT being disturbing and steeped in blood, physical violence and disturbing images that remain in your psyche long after the program is over.  We highly recommend this series.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|Let me start by saying that I am not an avid reader. In truth, this is the 1st book that I have read (in it's entirety) in several years. Typically, when I do read a book of this magnitude, I will read little bits here and there over the span of about a month. I read A Game of Thrones in less than 2 weeks. I could not put it down.<br /><br />Despite taking place in a fictional world, the book give a great feel of realism. Life can be harsh, and bad things happen. In most fantasy novels, a hero comes along and saves the day before the unthinkable things happen. That's not how it works in real life, and George RR Martin understands that. This gives the story unpredictability. You don't know from the start who will live and who will die. You also don't have your typical heroes and villains. Almost all of the characters are somewhere in the middle. Like in real life, you can't always know when some you least expect will do something uncharacteristic.<br /><br />Probably the most impressive thing about this book, is the magnitude of this world that George RR Martin has created. Events from thousands of years of history are mentioned throughout, and you really get the feel that these events shaped the world to the way that it is. The one thing that I can see being a bit overwhelming to some people, is the volume of characters that are named. There are literally hundreds of named characters in this book (and I read that there are over a thousand in the entire series). I can see where that many characters can be hard to keep track of, but I liked it. It made everything more personal, and believable.<br /><br />I honestly don't understand some of the reviews that talk about a slow start, or confusing format (multiple character point of views). My 1st sitting with this book, took me about 15% in. I had no problems staying intrigued throughout. The switching of POVs really helps to develop each character individually, and tie all the different story lines together. Personally, I had no difficulty following along.<br /><br />As far as all of the reviews that label this book as \\"porn\\" or \\"filth\\", I don't even know where to begin... Is the book vulgar? Yes. Does the book contain adult content? Yes. But to call it pornographic, is just ridiculous. Compared to the HBO series, I felt the book was rather tame. Sex, rape, incest... these things are mentioned in the book, but not described in great detail as some would have you believe. If the HBO series is rated TV-MA, then I would give the book a hard R at most.I had no difficulty following along.<br /><br />As far as all of the reviews that label this book as \\"porn\\" or \\"filth\\", I don't even know where to begin...

B008220DIC|4.0|Perhaps our most fascinating American director continues his evolution in a fascinating and frustrating film that I view with a mix of feelings.<br />It could well be argued that this is a step backwards from &#34;There Will Be Blood&#34;, and certainly, after 2 viewings, this lacks, for me the cohesive<br />power of the best of Anderson's earlier work.<br /><br />Some will just hate it. The pace is slow, the message often oblique, there's no catharsis, no easy answers. Just two riveting characters being<br />given riveting performances by two of our best actors, bouncing off each other, slowly giving us fragmentary glimpses into their souls.<br />Philip Seymour Hoffman plays the Master, a charismatic charlatan quasi-religious leader who desperately needs adulation, and seems to<br />have long ago lost track of how much of what he says he really believes, and how much he's just making up as he goes along. Joaquin<br />Phoenix plays Quell, an angry, possibly crazy young man suffering from what we'd probably now call PSTD after coming out of WW II.<br />He seems to need a father figure as desperately as Hoffman's Lancaster Dodd needs to be adored as a father, so these two are drawn<br />together, and yet repelled as they both can see the damaged souls under the other's surface, and in the eyes of the other see the reflection<br />of their own wounds. So begins a non carnal love story between these two characters. Indeed, to me the film seems to be about love and how<br />the American male has such a hard time asking for it, accepting it, giving it or taking it in any direct manner, so we start religions or become<br />acolytes ·(or become porn stars or heartless oil tycoons). The only thing these two polar opposites seem to have in common is that neither<br />of them can communicate without manipulation, or without burying their real meaning. And when they try to break through that, it inevitably<br />pushes them apart.<br /><br />It's the tragedy of the American male, a theme Anderson has explored repeatedly (along with fathers and sons);we can't cope with our feelings,<br />our vulnerability so we slowly pervert our need for love into quests for power, or violence, adulation, or domination or submissiveness. Whether<br />it's &#34;Hard 8&#34; or &#34;Boogie Nights&#34; or &#34;There Will Be Blood&#34;, Anderson's men are doomed by trying to be the men they think they have to be to<br />survive, thus distorting their perceptions and their hearts.<br /><br />But there is a fuzziness here. One of Anderson's great strength as a film-maker has been his ability to make us sharply understand what's going<br />on viscerally, even if at moments it's hard to get on a literal level. But, at least for me, there were too many moments when I felt lost in the bad<br />way, not in a mystery, but a muddle. There are very interesting scenes, but in retrospect I'm not sure what some of them added to the story. I<br />expected a second viewing to reveal greater depths, but for me instead it made the film feel a little more shallow, as if maybe some of the leaps<br />in logic didn't actually have a point, but were just slightly unfocused storytelling.<br /><br />I would still urge anyone interested in film-making or acting to see it. There is some spectacular work here, dramatically and visually. But, for<br />once, the sum of an Anderson film seems like less, not more than the sum of it's parts.e, a theme Anderson has explored repeatedly (along with fathers and sons);we can't cope with our feelings,<br />our vulnerability so we slowly pervert our need for love into quests for power, or violence, adulation, or domination or submissiveness.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|I just finished No Easy Day. I was skeptical at first that this may be more about political attack than about the events involving finding and killing OBL. I was memorized as I read about how the actual mission unfolded. All of the media hype and White House bemoaning involving this books content was completely false!! This was well written with an obvious effort to protect our JSOC secrets. Kudos to the author and publisher on sharing an factual account of the event in history that most of America and the free world was hoping for!

B001I7SGR8|3.0|Terminator 3 - Rise of the machines<br /><br />I would give 2.75 /5.0. I really can't get wired up about a hot looking blonde terminator out to terminate John Conner and Kate Brewster? The Beginning portion start out with a clear concise intro.. \\"So I stay off the grid...\\"  with a Budweiser in his hand was a classic scene, the ending had a good twist, kind of a stalemate to assure there was no divisive winner or loser....everything within the body of the movie just got lost in the translation though.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book was so disappointing. The writing was repetitive and uncreative, the characters were incredibly bland. I won't take the time to list the details so accurately described in other reviews, but this book takes what could have been a decent premise, and waters it down to a sophomoric essay. I know it's hard to resist, if by only for the curiosity, but save yourself some life and skip this book.
B0090EIILU|1.0|The Dictator was so awful, we quit watching after about five minutes.  We had thought Sasha Baron Cohen's Borat was funny, although we cringed at many of the scenes. This latest effort might entertain junior high age boys.  The few minutes we watched were like watching pornography made by a thirteen year old.
B0091QS88K|3.0|I downloaded this for our son, who will be 3 in November. Amazingly, having taken to and taken over Cooking Mama (on our wii), he fell in Livestream with It! It is more like mommy or daddy do in the kitchen, down to washing up dishes....but he was  bored with It after about a half hour. Free version only has 3 recipes. It is worth trying for free to see how your toddler likes It - but I wouldn't pay initially. (But a plate on the floor, tapped on by little boy fingers, making cheese+1 mouse come out with guests there-that was star #4!)
B009329ZF2|3.0|It took a short while to figure out why they called it Battleships.  It wasn't really the Battleship they used, but the grid style for the buoys that told the name.  That and the person saying \\"Miss\\".<br /><br />Action was good in the movie.  Overall I would say it was a good movie.  Not worth owning, and definitely worth trying to rent at a cheaper price.
B008Y1RTUG|5.0|Great movie!! Action packed, the score is epic (especially the song they sing when *someone* small dies) and the actors are perfect for their roles. Charlize Theron is IN-FREAKING-CREDIBLE as the queen and something about her you should really pay attention to are her costumes(I read a detailed aticle about them in Entertainment Weekly, I highly recommend you read it online before watching the movie, it makes the scences she's in so much cooler!)Kristen Stewart is Kristen Stewart, though I was impressed with how well she fit the role. The huntsman, hot, macho guy yet sensitive on the inside. The brother of the queen and everyone else is great. Can't recommend this movie more! Such a great spin on the original tale and I've seen almost every version of snow white that's out and I like this one the best. My favorite scene(not a spoiler!) has to do with a hart and believe me, you'll love it too.

Eva Tramell is more of a realistic main character then Anastasia was in 50 Shades, while she may come from a wealthy family that takes care of her needs, Eva also has baggage that helps the reader to identify with her as being a real person. Gideon Cross is fabulously sexy and I cant wait to find out more about him!!! Read Bared to You, it wont disappoint you!

B005LAIH5O|4.0|A pretty fun movie if you want some supersized destruction and carnage. They cut the budget on plot and writing to the minimum and spent the big bucks on the CGI.  Looks pretty good on a large widescreen so I'm not complaining.
0784011176|1.0|this is one of the ugliest movies I have ever viewed., Nothing of beauty in it whatsoever. I found no enjoyment in watching it at all. I felt there must have been a lot of anger in the person who wrote & directed it. Maybe I am wrong. Reviewers have given this movie equal status with the movie The Pianist, but I find that ludicrous. This movie in my estimation in no way is the equal of The Pianist, which is a superlatively exceptional movie. The Piano plumbs the depths of ugliness IMHO.

B007VI4TKQ|3.0|This is a good movie but it will not blow you away.  This movie is a remake, but like many other remakes it does not outshine the original movie.  The original idea is cool, combining human and animal dna together for survival and this is the last movie Marlon Brando did before he passed away but it is nothing special.  It is just another movie that loses steam and is very average.

B007STBUIW|5.0|What is there to say about this movie that has not been said?  This movie will live on forever until the end of time.  I love this movie and appreciate the effort that Stephen Spielberg puts into his films.  This movie plus E.T. gave Mr. Spielberg a major jump in his career of directing.  If you want to own a classic movie that is guaranteed to entertain, thrill, and keep you in suspense, then Jaws is one to own and put into your movie collection, plus with blu-ray it enhances the movie.  Universal struck oil with this movie!

B004J4WKTW|4.0|This isn't my typical genre to read and was prescribed by my new book club. I enjoyed the story, especially the beautifully creative visual descriptions of the circus: the characters, scenes, costumes, food, illusions and tricks. What an imagination Morgenstern has! More authors could benefit from her creativity.<br /><br />However, despite the beauty of the setting, I never got to a point in the story where I felt absolutely engrossed in the plot and just wanted to climb inside. The bouncing chronology took a few chapters to become acclimated to, especially since I dove right in without giving the Table of Contents or the chapter titles an ounce of notice. I corrected my approach around the fourth chapter. I admit, though, that the jostling chronology helped to bring my own uneasy emotions into the story because this is an incredibly unique circus and with each unfolding chapter the reader is presented with unexpected new imagery and more complex layers peeled away from the characters.<br /><br />So much time was spent in the story developing the circus and the characters but so little was written when various relationships formed towards the end. It felt like Morgenstern lost some steam in the last third of book. The collapse/resuscitation of the circus was quickly wrapped up and the readers are left wondering about the various couples.<br /><br />I guess by definition this story is classified as a romance, but it's a very tame one at that. First and foremost, this story is a fantasy.<br /><br />So despite my qualms described above, I did enjoy reading the story and venturing into a genre that is not my typical preference.

I consider The War of Art to be a must read for everyone.  I have  ordered several to give to my immediate friends and family. Everyone has been singing praises about how incredible and on-point the War of Art is and they can't thank me enough.
B007U1FEQW|1.0|Having purchased the CD version and the vinyl 45rpm single, I had high hopes for for the vinyl LP version. Well.....in short, it sucks big time! The vinyl LP is of very poor quality, playing with lots of surface noise. The noise is really disturbing while playing the 1st track, which is a capella. I'm not sure who pressed this vinyl LP for Capitol, but that is where the problem lays, a poor pressing job. I have tried to clean the LP to no avail. I would NOT recommend purchasing this album in vinyl if you plan to play it.

B007L6VR12|3.0|\\"You two are the most appallingly incompetent custodial guardians Social Services has ever had the misfortune to encounter in a 27 year career.\\" While sitting down to breakfast one morning Scout Master Ward (Norton) notices that one of his troops is missing. He quickly calls Captain Sharp (Willis) and the word is passed on to the parents. When it comes out that the boy has run off with another local girl not only do the parents get involved but Social Services is called in also. This may end up being a pretty short review because since this is a Wes Anderson movie people have already kind of made up their mind on whether to watch or not. His style is not for everyone. To me I either really love his stuff or I don't. I really like almost all his work (I didn't like \\"Royal Tananbaums\\") but to me \\"Rushmore\\" and \\"Fantastic Mr. Fox\\" are his best. This one is not at the level of those movies but this is still pretty funny. There are few directors that have a definite style and you know instantly that it's one of their movies. Anderson, Kubric and Hitchcock are the ones that come immediately to mind. Again though this is funny but not for everyone, very dry humor. Overall, if you like Wes Anderson movies then you will love this one, if not then it's 50/50 if you will enjoy it. I thought it was OK but not his best. I give it a B.

160774273X|5.0|I've read many of the usual suspects of this genre: Jim Lahey, Chad Robertson, Amy's Bread, Peter Reinhart.  You would think that there wasn't that much room for improvement based on what those fine books have taught.  But what Ken Forkish has done here is not simply to give you recipes, but to teach you to think with the flexibility that bread baking demands, and to also demand creativity out of you to go past what's in the book.<br /><br />One of the very best things about Ken's book is that he doesn't just throw recipes out there, then try to explain with a little blurb above them, or even, as Robertson did, to give an in-depth explanation after you've tried your hand at it.  Instead, Ken goes and teaches you the concepts first, then goes and gives you a structure of recipe writing that helps you identify the concepts taught within the context of the recipe.  You're going to feel more comfortable making the bread from the first attempt.<br /><br />There's a lot here for the experienced bread baker here.  Different mixes of flours, double fed levains, hybrid levain-commercial yeast solutions.  There's a fantastic section on how to make recipes your own, whether it be about flour choices (and the different hydration requirements that some flours require), rearranging schedules to make your bread revolve around your life, the various options you have with levains, how to document your experimentation so that you can reproduce the results the next time.<br /><br />Like Robertson and Lahey, he's baking in cast iron pots-- he prefers the smaller (and harder to find) 4 quart models, which contribute to higher rises in his opinion.  The book, because of his structure, works exclusively in those pots, but he tells you how to adjust his system if you wanted to take a batch of dough meant for two loaves and turn it into one massive miche.<br /><br />There's also an excellent pizza making section, with sauce recipes, pizza tossing instructions, plus pan pizza recipes.  He ends with a Lagniappe of some hazelnut butter cookies, but I have to admit, I was really hoping he'd share a baguette recipe since he'd referenced them so often in his own story.<br /><br />All in all, a superb book that adds a lot of depth to the genre.ds with a Lagniappe of some hazelnut butter cookies, but I have to admit, I was really hoping he'd share a baguette recipe since he'd referenced them so often in his own story.<br /><br />All in all, a superb book that adds a lot of depth to the genre.
B003K1EYM6|1.0|I bought it from a seller which is supposed to be a trusted seller and full filled by amazon but it is not the genuine item sold by apple, the packaging is the real thing but inside is one of those Chinese 2$ knock offs. what makes me so frustrated is that I dont mind if it was a knock off but worked well, no in fact as soon as I inserted the SD card with very minimal pressure the whole plastic cover broke and I have to glue the whole thing together!!!! so angry because I am out of country and cant send it back for refund so basically I am screwed. congratulations for the seller you just made alot of money from selling a cheap knock off for 30$!!! I hope Amazon will consider what this seller did so it wont happen again with other buyers.<br /><br />PS. I attached a pic of what was in the box. It is obvious that it is not real:<br />1- no logo or anything on the kits from behind<br />2- the plastic nylon bag they were in is not the one like the original<br />3- no instruction manuals<br /><br />check other unboxing videos on youtube to believe what i am saying
B007HGPBRC|5.0|Christopher Hitchens is a brilliant writer who faces the greatest challenge of his life when he is diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer of the esophagus. He holds nothing back as he takes us with him on this last journey. At times funny, heartbreaking and insightful, he is above all else honest. His discussion of his relationships with his wife and family and friends provide an intimate insight into a man we knew only at a distance from his other books and television appearances. His final essay isn't an essay at all. Rather it's a string of the last bits and pieces he wrote, each one evidence of a man fighting hard to hang on and give meaning to every moment. The afterward by his wife, writer Carol Blue, adds warmth and depth to both him and their relationship. Highly recommended.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I love Stephen King's books, and this one might be his best yet. I could not put it down until my eyes were closing on their own at night. I got very little sleep until I finished. I so wanted to turn to the back and read the ending, because the suspense was killing me. I'm glad I waited, and I loved the ending!<br /><br />This is not a horror book. It's about finding your moral way, whether the good old days were really that good, and the meaning of sacrifice. Pretty much King's favorite themes, but I found the \\"flavor\\" to be completely different from any of his other books. It has some weirdness, but it's not a horror book and it doesn't have the darkness of many of his works. So if horror is not your thing, you will probably love this book even if you're not normally a fan.<br /><br />The Stand has been my favorite Stephen King book for 30 years, but I've decided I have to go back and re-read it again to see if The Stand or 11/22/63 is my favorite. Either way, 11/22/63 is one of my favorite books of all time.
B000FC10IO|3.0|Abhorsen starts where Lirael left off -- during the tense pause between Lirael and Sam's journey south and their adventure west to rescue Nicholas Sayre and confront the Necromancer Hedge and the powerful evil he is digging up with his enslaved Dead. If Hedge succeeds, the Destroyer will be unleashed on both the Old Kingdom and Ancelestierre alike.  This book is a worthwhile ending to the trilogy.  Lirael and Sameth set out, with the help of their \\"Dog\\" and \\"Cat\\" assistants but without the help of their Clayr, Abhorsen and Royal families.<br /><br />This third and final chapter is as exciting as the first two, fraught with battles, adventures, mysteries and dangers far beyond the Greater Dead. Both Charter and Free Magic come to life, so vividly that the reader really knows what it feels like to remember and cast a spell! I would say that the ending is drawn out a bit, as the heroes chase Hedge and the hemispheres on and on from the lake to the coast, with a lot of back-and-forth and a climax that takes nearly a hundred pages to cover only a few hours of time. And overall my favorite is the second book, because I loved Lirael's adventures in the Clayr library and her initial discovery of the world of the Dead.  Overall, Abhorsen is an awesome, original fantasy series worth owning to read again and again.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|Watching this on TV got me hooked on reading Jane Austen. It is a beautiful mini series that does more justice to Austen's novel than most others I've seen. It comes much closer and is a more faithful adaption as a four part mini series than a stand alone movie. You just can't condense such wonderful novels into two hour movies and so them any justice.
B007RI56NY|5.0|It has some really good songs on the album, even though some of the beats sound the same the songs in general are nice to listen too.

B0064TVQ5E|5.0|The Mahjong HD full version is definitely worth the money.  I absolutely love it. A word of warning though, if you have an additive personality like I do you may not be able to put it down and walk away. I always think that I can beat my previous time!<br />For those who are complaining about frequent locking up, I may have solved the issue.  Originally,  I downloaded the free version and found that it would lock up on me in levels 6-10 requiring a hard reboot of my Kindle.  I purchased the paid app and downloaded it but did not uninstall the free app. I have yet to have it lock up on me, even in the upper levels.<br />My only complaint is that your scores earned on the free app do not transfer to the paid app.

There seems to be a lot of years to cover if its to wrap up in three books.

B005A1ER0I|5.0|I downloaded this album not too long ago and put it on my Droid 3, because I use my phone as an MP3 player when I'm walking places. It adds just a touch of \\"epic\\" to my day as I walk along, especially when tracks like Starvation, Rada, or Ocean Princess start playing. Those ones are my favorites and evoke a lot of different images for me. This music is like having an awesome movie soundtrack for your life. It's wonderfully orchestrated, the vocals are amazing, the compositions are amazingly complex and out of this world... there just aren't enough adjectives in the English language to describe the sheer magnitude of excellence contained in this album.

B004J4WNL2|4.0|An enlightening read. Every introvert should read this book, and probably every extrovert too. The book shows why too often the Extrovert Ideal fails in todays culture. The author shows how introverts could have prevented the 2008 financial collapse, if only the financial world knew how to value their input. The book is full of anecdotes and research that shows that not only is introversion normal, but is something that ought to be encouraged. It tells about how and when introverts should fake extroversion and when they should be themselves. I didn't give the book five stars only because some of the chapters heavy on brain research were a little hard to get through for me. They were still fascinating, but I would rather have a little less detail on the technical stuff and more anecdotes showing the practical side.
B000IZA9PI|5.0|a great end of to a long term of great chapters one of the best if not the best, very well written great storyline and none stop action.

B00009MGR6|4.0|The songs are great on here but much like Fly On The Wall - it's the production that hurts the album. It's better than Fly in that aspect but not by much. That's a shame because Brian's voice was still in top shape here.<br /><br />It's no Back In Black but it's not trying to be. Great stuff on here - Heatseeker, That's The Way, Meanstreak, Ruff Stuff.
0439023521|5.0|I avoided this series because it didn't sound like something that would interest me; I'm not into futuristic or fantasy novels in the least. This series, however, makes me keep an open mind from now on. The authors writing is simplistic and easy to follow and it was an easy page turner. The story line was great and I found myself continuously looking forward to reading more. It's now one of my favorite series, a far cry from the horror/paranormal/suspense books I normally read!
0756404738|3.0|I was really excited to get my NEW, hard cover copy of Wise Man's Fear. Unfortunately the edge of the cover was bent and a little worn. There were some pen marks in the book.

B0016HMYEQ|5.0|excellently performed and executed, the movie rings home for people who live in the NYC area who would be familiar with the areas that are shown in the movie (downtown, midtown, etc). My only discomfort is that it left me with too many questions, but I don't see this as a bad thing. Great out-of-the-box thinking from JJ Abrams on this one.

B001FXCE46|5.0|There are so many things right with this album and its production that I don't know where to start. First off, I think that the lead vocalist for the band, Caleb, has such an incredible tone that catches your attention from the start and never lets it wander. Next, the band itself puts forth some instrumentals that are great all on their own. Also, the album makes use of several genres but most interesting is the fusion of Southern blues, mainly from Caleb's vocals and alternative rock and plain old rock, courtesy of the band. Together this exciting and slightly addicting mix keep your ears glued from start to finish. While it may not be perfect, even its weakest spots are from intolerable. More than 3 years following its release stateside, the album entertains like a good one should.<br /><br />Highlights: \\"Closer,\\" \\"Sex On Fire,\\" \\"Manhattan,\\" \\"Revelry,\\" and \\"Coldest Desert.\\"
B007ELN8Y8|3.0|Although it was visually attractive, it did not hold my interest.  The music kept making me doze off and I could never get into the plot.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game!!! Not only is it fun, challenging,  and addictive,  it's also good for your mind. This isn't just another brain-numbing game. You should totally get this. It starts out REALLY easy, but then it gets more and more challenging by making the grid larger. Also, you can skip levels if you're having trouble with one, or jump around through the different levels.  This is SO fun!  I &lt;3 Flow!!!

034580404X|4.0|I guess it's been awhile since I last read anything romantic and I am glad the BDSM is rather on the soft side! (wouldn't be able to handle that well).  Before reading any reviews on it and having read 2.5 books of the trilogy without any prejudices from other readers, I noticed I like the lovestory unfolding between the two main characters.  I love Anastasia standing her ground and experience her as naive/unexperienced and yet strong and true to herself. I love the way Christian is intrigued, captivated and against his will seduced by it and slowly transformed.<br />I can relate and find various traits and aspects about myself in the characters and identify with them.<br /><br />After reading the reviews I can see how people might find the style lacking sophistication and lines somewhat repetitive, however, maybe I was unknowingly craving a bit of romance in my life so that it didn't bother me overly.
B0013O123Q|2.0|If you like spinning camera effects for no other reason than to seem artistic, you'll love this movie. This movie is most famous for it's very realistic RAPE scene and the reverse order of the presentation of the movie. Other than watching this one for the very well performed ( disturbingly so) graphic scene, there's not much of a reason to slog through this film.

B000ICXQXI|5.0|Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />Regarded by some as the finest Hitchcock film ever, Psycho begins gently, then slowly turns dark before becoming terrifying in one of the most shocking scenes ever filmed. Janet Leigh, Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles and John Gavin are the principal actors this time around, and involved in another sinister game of suspense as only The Master can cook up. Sir Alfred Hitchcock has surprised you before, but never with anything like this.<br /><br />Miles away from civilisation lies the Bates Motel. You are cordially invited to stay for a night or two...<br /><br />Rated R, but should be rated PG (mild violence).
B007MG360G|5.0|This is a great game. It is so creative and is perfect for kids. The artistic skills used to create the images for the game are beautifully done. Keep it going!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from the Hunger Games - but I had some time to kill so I bought the first book on my kindle and I read the book nearly straight through... (a girl has to nap and eat ya know).  As soon as I was finished with the first book I got the second, and then the third.  It's one of those stories that makes reading fun, one of the stories you don't ever want to end.  If you saw the movie and you weren't impressed, don't worry, neither was I.  The books won't let you down.  The story is so complex but so well written that it doesn't become confusing.  If you like to read, or if you don't like to read, I'm sure that this will catch your attention and satisfy an itch to let your mind escape for a bit.

B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Harold and Maureen Fry are living in quiet retirement in small Devon town. Love vacated the marriage two decades ago: the couple sleep apart and hardly speak to each other. Maureen talks to their son David, but he never comes to see them. Harold worked for forty-five years in the local brewery and one day a former colleague named Queenie Hennessey writes from a hospice in Berwick-upon-Tweed to say that she is dying (of inoperable cancer, not cirrhosis of the liver). Harold pens a short reply, utterly devoid of emotion, and walks down the street to post it. He passes two post boxes, the post office and eventually finds himself on the outskirts of town, walking north.<br /><br />So begins Harold's journey. At a garage outside town he tells a young woman of his idea of walking to Berwick to reply to Queenie in person, and she inspires him by telling a tale of her aunt who was also dying of cancer and how the power of faith saved her. This confirms Harold's determination and he begins a long, slow walk. He is old, out of shape and not in the least prepared for such a long journey, causing him to doubt the sanity of his decision, but he now believes that as long as he keeps walking, Queenie will live.<br /><br />Harold meets a variety of characters along the way, most of them with troubled, unfulfilled lives. A few scoff at his efforts but most are encouraging and after an encounter with a young reporter his story attracts media attention and a circus band of followers who threaten to undermine the purpose and purity of Harold's quest.<br /><br />But the central story is the transformation of both Harold and Maureen during the course of Harold's travels. He realises that he has been a poor husband and a failure as a father, but also recalls how he was abandoned by his own parents and how this made him shy away from the world until he first met Maureen. He remembers how it all went wrong and how their marriage descended into a long sad silence, and is increasingly heartbroken about the son who abandoned them.<br /><br />On good days he is heartened by the natural world around him, how it teems with life, and learns to be more accepting of people he meets. He works on the premise that most strangers are kind and this turns out to be true. On the bad days he is wracked by despair, physically exhausted and full of doubt about his journey and his worth as a human being.<br /><br />Maureen has mixed feelings when she first finds out what Harold is doing. She pretends it is of no consequence, but is increasingly lonely and lost without him. When Harold calls from phone boxes up and down the country, she is unable to express how she really feels. Too many years of building barriers between each other has left both Maureen and Harold unable to tear them down. It is a widowed neighbour, Rex, who helps Maureen to understand her feelings more clearly and to finally speak to Harold with meaning and affection.<br /><br />Queenie is dying, but she also suffered in the past and it is this latter episode that causes Harold a degree of guilt and leads him to question the integrity of his life. We can never go back and undo the past, but sometimes we can make amends and move forward in a different way. Can Harold and Maureen make a change now, or is it all too late?<br /><br />Rachel Joyce is an actor and playwright. This is her first novel and the characters are based on an earlier radio play. All quest or journey stories have a standard structure, and this book is no exception. But the writing is clear and evocative, and Harold, Maureen and Rex are characters with whom most readers will have empathy. It is a touching story that explores regret and guilt, and questions whether and how we can move beyond the burden of our past. There is also a nice sting in the tail: at the end of the journey two people are dead and Harold and Maureen are laughing their heads off on the beach at Berwick.

B007IO1X5C|3.0|Mention the words `ethics' or `morals' to an economist or politician and you will be met with that blank, uncomprehending stare that was once the sole preserve of the village idiot. Broad areas of social life since the 1980s have been colonised by commerce and advertising, actively encouraged by governments and their business allies. Politicians and economists swear blind that all this has nothing to do with values or morals - it's simply about improved efficiency and freedom of choice. The great virtue of Michael Sandel's What Money Can't Buy is to show us that such claims are utter codswallop.<br /><br />Sandel catalogues the invasion of money culture into ever expanding areas of our daily lives: health care, social services, the use of public space and amenities, insurance, education, criminal justice, environmental pollution and sport, just to name a few. We have allowed a money value to be put on just about everything, and in the process have indicated that all these things are up for sale to the highest bidder.<br /><br />Sandel is not opposed to the market economy, but he makes the point that a market economy is not the same as a market society. The flood of commercial thinking into areas of life that a few decades ago had no commercial value at all changes our understanding of these things and shapes our values about what can be bought and sold. Paying children to read books, as is done in many cities in the US, might appear to be a good thing if it encourages reading, but at the same time it changes our view of reading from being a source of pleasure to being a profitable chore. And when the money stops, where is the motivation to keep going?<br /><br />The book sets out two major objections to money culture. The first is that it promotes inequality. Paying extra to jump queues, to get quicker or better medical services, or have our call to the local gas board answered earlier, means that those who get the best service are those most able to pay, not thosewho need the service most urgently. Wealthy people increasingly pay extra to sit apart from others in public transport, in sports stadiums and at public events, reducing the democratic nature of public spaces and the level of social interaction between classes. We are becoming more unequal not just in our access to goods and services, but also in our sense of being a community.<br /><br />This is neatly expounded by Sandel in his discussion of fines versus fees. Fees are something that everyone pays for specific services. A fine is a punishment for transgressing a law. But the rich - individuals and companies - often regard fines as fees allowing them to behave badly. Dump toxic waste into a public waterway? Cause criminal damage in a drunken spree? The rich just pay a fine which is small change to them and go on their merry way. Finland has addressed this by making fines proportional to income, but politicians in almost every other country continue to bleat and moan that this would be too difficult for them.<br /><br />The second main objection to money culture is that it corrupts our social life, particularly in terms of degrading the status of public goods and services. The re-naming of parks and sports stadiums to reflect sponsorship, the exclusive consumption of sponsors' goods in public spaces, commercial labels on UK police cars, paying for a spot in the line to sit and watch a session of Congress in the US, paying people to have tattoos of products placed on their foreheads - such things degrade us both individually and as a society. We are cheapened by the price tag.<br /><br />Sandel's views are consistent with the longer term analysis of David Graeber, who noted that in historical cycles where money use and money values dominate, social inequality increases whereas the value placed on human life and the level of trust between individuals both decrease.<br /><br />There is a third objection in this book, though it is given less prominence. This is that increasing commercialisation reduces our freedom of choice. Sandel notes that on some beaches in the US, Coca Cola has the exclusive right to provide drinks, so consumers have choice taken away from them. The recent London Olympics was a prime example of this, where a small number of sponsors forbade people to exercise choice in products and even prevented businesses all over the country from using words that might be vaguely associated with the games. The Olympics was one of the earliest institutions to prostitute itself in this way, but many others have followed suit.<br /><br />There are two related issues that are not well addressed in this book. The first is that commercialisation often leads to greater economic inefficiency. This is not just because it limits choice, but also because it allows market problems to remain unresolved. Paying to jump to the head of the queue - at an airport, in a call to the bank, or at a clinic - means that the queuing system is not working efficiently. Instead of fixing it, payments for favoured treatment just perpetuate the problem and allow it to be ignored. Economic efficiency gets worse, not better.<br /><br />The other issue is that of ugliness. Many people will complain about graffiti, but then sit at home and watch a cable TV channel in which the screen is littered with advertisements, logos and redundant information, often obscuring what you are trying to watch. People complain about billboards and placards on the streets, but do so while wearing clothes that carry the names and logos of companies and sponsors. Are cable stations and companies paying us for the privilege of helping them and degrading ourselves in this way? Of course not: we pay them to be abused. Advertisements appear on pieces of fruit, stamped into sand on the beach, all over public transport and schools, and in public parks. Money culture has made our environment cluttered and ugly. Local governments will say that this is the only way they can afford to maintain public spaces and services, which means the problem of insufficient public funding is not being addressed. Instead, we allow lazy and unimaginative public officials to treat the symptom by commercial littering rather than fix the problem.<br /><br />Most people will be surprised, and many people appalled, at the range and number of examples that Sandel cites in this book. The weakness in his presentation is that the key arguments against money culture are inserted here and there in the text more as comments on the examples rather than being a cohesive argument about the nature of modern society. His criticisms could have been much stronger with a better developed structure, but there is still plenty for the thoughtful reader to ponder. The question is: what can we do to turn the tide? Sandel offers no advice on this other than a plea to re-inject morals and ethics into public debate. It's a start, but given the squalid state of post-1980s politics we have an awfully long way to go.
B008I3QZKU|4.0|BB isn't likely to pull in new listeners, but it should please people who are already Killers fans.  Elements of the previous 3.5 albums are all present while not overwhelming or leeching sound.  The dark, wonky, Atari 2600 synths on steroids are as crisp and warm as you'd find on Hot Fuss and Saw Dust.  The crunchy guitar and neon mustang on an infinite highway of Sam's Town are there.  Day & Age's extraterrestrial earthy dip & dots are present.<br /><br />Perhaps most pleasing is where the overall song crafting has moved towards.  Each song builds and goes somewhere as the song progresses.  Often adding elements at surprising parts in the song so that what sounded like a more straight forward rock song might have synth runs out of now where.  Not like Somebody Told Me or When You Were Young, where the riff introduces itself and says \\"Hello, you'll be listening to me for 3 straight minutes.
