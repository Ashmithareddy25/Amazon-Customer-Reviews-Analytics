B004ZNAGNE|5.0|The jury's still out on the remastering. The live disc, however, is essential for any Pink Floyd fan. Fantastic stuff!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Finished this book in a day because I couldn't put it down. The story Suzanne Collins tells is beautifully written and has a very deep meaning to it. The way she writes this story takes you from wherever you are and brings you into the world of Panem. You feel for the characters and want them to be free of the pain the capitol causes. I cannot wait to begin the last journey of this world that could easily become our own.
1118109791|5.0|I bought this book about three months prior to taking my GMAT's.  I did no other preparations or studying outside of this book and I was able to get a 750 on my GMAT's.<br /><br />I did about 40 verbal questions and 40 quantitative questions every time I sat down to study (comparable to the number of questions on the actual GMAT's).  Studying about 2-3 times a week for about 3 hours each time, I felt fully prepared for the GMAT's.  This is a great book that will help you prepare for the exam and this is a must-have for anyone looking to take the exam in the future.  The hardest thing for me was the pacing though.  While studying for the exam, I highly recommend timing yourself (75 mins for ~40 questions).
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Sheryl speaks the truth--I have already used her words or quotes from the book! Even my husband is interested in what I'm learning from this book.
B002JIEYLC|1.0|Great packaging, great photos, great essay with a lot of input from Bill Ward. BUT the remastering is terrible. Absolutely dreadful! I could not listen to the whole thing. I'm just aghast at what a mess this is as far as being given the green light for a legitimate release.
1907016414|5.0|I don't normally go for this brand of erotica. The kind of erotica I read is fun, carefree, and often fantastical. Girl Trade took me on a vivid, realistic journey of what it is to be broken like a horse, branded like cattle, and sold like a slave. <br /><br />The setting itself is worth the price. This is travel erotica. The descriptions of the Sahara desert - the rise and fall of the dunes, the sand in your teeth, the carnal smell of the camels, the fire at night, the movement in the saddle - lend to a wonderful, sensual experience and you feel as though you are truly there.<br /><br />What makes Ms. Thurlow's story unique is how a woman brought up with Western ideas of what's right and what's wrong discovers how rewarding it is to be a woman in the midst of a different culture with different ideas of what's moral and proper. The main character Chengi discovers the pleasure of having a man who cares when she has done wrong and shows it with a firm spanking. She discovers the delight in wearing a symbol of belonging to one man, and the thrill of being wanted by other men at auction.<br /><br />I applaud Ms. Thurlow's courage in presenting us with a woman like Chengi who changes her belief system so much that Chengi finds it natural to be the sexual vessel for a group of men who take her with them on a caravan and use her for their sexual release. Girl Trade is more a reflection on what it means to be a woman in Western society and asks the question, &#34;Considering the forbidden delights women experience in other cultures, might the Western treatment of women be wrong?&#34;<br /><br />Girl Trade was not the most pleasurable erotica I've read, but it's one of the most important books I've read. Ever. If scenes of caning and sexual encounters of dubious consent make you uncomfortable, I recommend reading Girl Trade for its philosophical content, and not for its erotic content. And for those of you who enjoy a good spanking and scenes of dub con sex, Girl Trade isperfect for your fantasies of Arabian nights.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I really really really want this game but I want it free! $3.99 is a lot. it must be a great game because people always talk about it.
B001QKSWOE|4.0|Another entertaining Stephanie Plum novel. Love Wicked Appetite and Wicked Business so this intro to Wulf and Jessica (sort of) was fun. Mixing it up is good for a long-running franchise.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|This was really worth owning. Washington played this to the T like he always do.and Pine held his ground with Washington
B003Y5RLR8|5.0|I Thought this was done with good taste and enjoyed his music. Elvis put so much into his music for all of us to enjoy and I have always appreciated each show was as if it was the first.  I believe his music will live on forever as his talent will not be surpassed.  Loved the Stamps singing &#34;Sweet, Sweet Spirit&#34; on this disc. A beautiful hymn! I  enjoyed it much as Elvis seemed to. Elvis has been an important part of my life since I was thirteen years old.  He seemed to be a very nice person with strong family values and showed respect for others always.  He was a large influence in my life and I'm hopeful I turned out half as kind and respectful and he. I will always be an &#34;Elvis&#34; fan and this week had the great privilege of visiting Graceland with my niece.  Thank you Lisa Marie and Priscilla for sharing your lives and home with all of us who loved him.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I was a little taken back by the price of this movie because of it being a 3D it should'nt cost so much. But when I saw the 3D I was pleased I bought but not sure if I can afford 3D movies and not like the movie. Maybe one day the price will go down.
B004132HZS|5.0|Quick paced action that keeps you hooked from the very start of the show to the very last minute. Enjoy!
1118109791|4.0|Prepping for GMAT is tedious work, that is why I have to give 4 stars to this book. )) But it contains a good collection of practice sets and essay questions. So I do like it -- very much.
B000002GBD|4.0|I believe that \\"Hair Of The Dog\\" was the album that really introduced Nazareth to the music scene, in 1975. I had already heard \\"Hair Of The Dog\\" & \\"Love Hurts\\" BEFORE, I bought this record in February 1976. Most of the OTHER song titles really appealed to me, MORE than the TWO  songs, that I had just mentioned.  It is time for me to offer my review & opinions of each song as follows:<br /><br />1.  \\"Hair Of The Dog\\"...This TITLE TRACK is a really decent album opener.  I always got a kick out of the words & the fantastic music & beat to this cut.<br /><br />2.  \\"Miss Misery\\"...This is one of my TOP favorite songs on this entire album. I love this meaning about a WITCHY WOMAN that has an EVIL SPELL over someone, who tries to break free from her, but CAN'T.  Excellent guitar music, which could put me in mind of a song that Black Sabbath could be good on, vocally & musically. But it's Nazareth's song & it's JUST great.<br /><br />3.  \\"Love Hurts\\"...This song was NOT written by Nazareth. Roy Orbison & The Everly Brothers had recorded it in 1961, although I've NEVER heard it by THEM before @ all.  Nazareth's remake version of this song was a TOP 10 single, that was on the charts for 14 weeks, reaching #8. \\"Love Hurt's\\" was the BIGGEST hit from this album. All & all, it's not a bad song, but it's not my favorite.<br /><br />4.  \\"Changin' Times\\"...This is my 2nd TOP favorite song incl., here.  It is just a little over 6 minutes long. Halfway through, the tempo becomes somewhat faster & it's ALL instrumental, to the end of the song.  I love the vocals, too, on the FIRST half. For some reason, this song reminds me of something that Led Zeppelin could be good on.<br /><br />5.  \\"Beggars Day\\"...This song WASN'T written by Nazareth, either. It was written by Nils Lofgren, who I always heard of, but I don't remember what HE'S noted for. \\"Beggars Day\\", in my opinion, TIES w/ \\"Miss Misery\\" as being my TOP favorite song. I love EVERYTHING about this one.<br /><br />6.  \\"Rose In TheHeather\\"...This has a PRETTY title which is a short, but pretty INSTRUMENTAL. I love this, esp. w/ the strings towards the end of the tune.<br /><br />7.  \\"Whiskey Drinkin' Woman...This song is cute & rather comical @ times. It features more of a COUNTRY ROCK flavor to it.<br /><br />8.  \\"Please Don't Judas Me\\"...This is NOT my favorite song @ all. I'm really glad that it's the LAST song, this way I can reject it, if I choose to. I like the music, but otherwise it's too long, doom laden & downright depressing. It honestly could remind me of a JUDGMENT DAY theme & once the FEMALE backing vocals begin, it really gives me the chills up & down my spine. A really haunting song that's NOT too easily forgotten, @ least by me, or maybe many others, too.<br /><br />I'm so glad that I had ordered this CD on the 8th of May, 2013...because I wanted to hear a lot of these songs again. This is a 4 star album OR 4 1/2 star album, in my opinion & it is most definitely recommended. I forgot to mention, that \\"Hair Of The Dog\\" was the very FIRST album, that I ever bought by Nazareth.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This is a movie I could watch more than once. I didn't think it would be that good. I would tell everyone to watch
B000HL09MG|3.0|To slow and not enough plot. Characters kept repeating the lines<br />Really a boring watch and not much in regards to a story
B00B23O96A|5.0|I bought Eric Claptons CD OLD SOCK from AMAZON,COM. After listening to the whole CD I really enjoyed the music. the OLD SOCK CD is a little different than what you might expect from Clapton, but regardless its a great CD at a great price. Claptons music is a little more laid back actually a nice laid back where you can actually here the talent we all know Eric Clapton has with the guitar. I suggest you buy the CD from AMAZON.COM and decide for yourself, after all, its ERIC CLAPTON, has he ever made a bad recording? Not in my lifetime.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|No instructions on how to play.  A tutuorial on how to play the game would have been nice to have.

B007N5YIUS|5.0|Took some time to figure the ins and outs of this one as there are no directions that I could find. The demos don't always make sense until you've played for a while. But, that said, it's a challenge to find the hidden helps and to make it through the levels.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Every time a new season comes a new season comes in the game and harder levels plus better levels instead of the old ones
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This was a very disturbing, eye opening movie! It is strange, but realistic, how the government hides behind legal tape and will not open big corporation doors. If its not harming the general public, then let us know and see how you are prepping the food that we consume
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much fun. With all the cool new stuff they add every mouth I can't stop playing.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Truly, truly, awesome show. It brings back so much that has been missing from sci-fi since the days of Stargate, Jericho, and V. So, so good. Watch it now! You won't regret it.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Although Game of Throne has all the usual trappings of medieval fantasy (knights in armor, tournaments, division of people into lords and ladies and the &#34;small  people,&#34; dragons, and sorcerers, its &#34;realistic&#34; characters, unexpected turns and twists, place the story in another new, fascinating, and utterly different category.  The other two books, the second is finished and I' m 20% through the third--make me hunger for more.
B0017SWSCW|5.0|If you have read any of Archer's books, you will enjoy this book as I have.  Somewhat of a Monte Cristo plot, it still keeps the reader<br />ln a complete sense of enjoyment.  The villains are characters of a  modern conspiracy and the plot of revenge against them proves<br />Archer's ability to take the reader along with complete enjoyment.  I am an Archer fan and I thoroughly enjoyed his writing this novel<br />even with the overshadowing of Dumas.  One can relax and enjoy the story, plot, hero and villains
B003UESJH4|5.0|I love anything to do with the Monarchy. This was a great insight into what King George VI went through to overcome his speech impediment. This was a great movie.

B00475AYJQ|5.0|One of the best fantasy books I've read to date. Some other reviewers said that the timing was off, I think it's just a matter of a storyteller dangling the line a bit. Can't wait until the next one in the series.
1416914285|5.0|I normally do not write reviews for books but I can not say enough about this book. It is the best book ever and I absolutely love the series. I fangirl and talk about this book all the time. I love Cassandra's writing style and I love how the book is witty. It makes me laugh when I least expect it. I give this book a 10/10 and I cant wait to read the rest of the series. I am counting down until the movie. I heard about this book when it first came out but I didn't want to read it yet because of all the hype. I am glad I waited and a plus was that my book came first edition and it was signed. I am very happy by the seller.

B008XG1X18|5.0|At first, I was skeptical. I was a junior in college before I've even heard of this new &quot;phenomenon, and I refused to jump on the bandwagon until 3 years after that. But I'm soooo glad to say that Pinterest, when used correctly, is transforming me into a crafty gal! Now I LOVE finding cheaper substitutes for almost anything - food, body, house, gifts, classroom, etc. etc. etc. The possibilities are endless. I'm excited to get my own apartment and actually start living the Pinterest life! ;)
B002U3CCKQ|4.0|Even though I thought the story 'dragged on' the characters were so bleak and disturbed especially the main character - very entertaining
B004X6PRO6|4.0|I'm still reading it.  It's exciting, but there's something wrong for me I can't quite put a finger on.  I read reviews that said the book or author was self-indulgent.  Sometimes it does seem over the top, though I truly like the writing.  I have to remind myself that it is fiction, as it's easy to get swept away.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This was my first zombie literature and I found it to be more than exciting. I am a huge history geek and found Brooks' multiple angles gave this book a very unique quality.
B00AJER3SE|5.0|Enjoyed watching it again. One of my favorite. This movie launched Schwarzenegger's career. Especially in Blu-ray. Can't go wrong with this movie.

B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|Interesting enough to watch for an hour.  I Lost interest after that didn't see the end.  Boring and confusing it jumps from past to future every few minutes
B00AAQRNQ8|3.0|This mouse is OK for a gaming mouse.  It is fairly comfortable as it is large (I have big hands) and you can adjust the weight.  However, there are a few things that I do not like about it.<br /><br />First, the 3 thumb buttons are fairly sensitive, so when you pick your mouse up to adjust or do a long scroll you WILL accidentally click one of those thumb buttons.  If you're in-game this can obviously be very frustrating.<br /><br />Second, while the buttons are programmable, you cannot completely customize the button behavior.  For example, every button must map to a button on your keyboard or a macro.  There is no such thing as \\"Button 3\\", \\"Button 4\\", etc.  So if you want one of the thumb buttons to map to a certain weapon in-game, you must make the button map to a keyboard key (e.g. \\"Shift\\") and then make the Shift button map to your weapon in-game.  This makes it very difficult to manage across multiple games where certain buttons have different default behaviors.  Instead, all the buttons on the mouse should have the option to be generic button clicks, e.g. Mouse Button 1, Mouse Button 2, Mouse Button 3, etc.  This is how Logitec mice work and if I had known this about the Anker I would not have made the purchase.<br /><br />Third, the shape of the mouse just seems a little off.  Obviously this is more subjective, and I'm biased towards my last mouse, but I just cannot get used to the shape.  With the Logitech MX400 or MX500 you can pick up the mouse easily without accidentally clicking the side/thumb buttons, and the material used on the sides is slip resistant.  Compare to the Anker which feels nice but the grip under your thumb feels almost slippery.

B00C7O8MJ8|1.0|Giacchino's first Star Trek score was impoverished from the start. In his second outing, his themes are almost monophonic in their dark simplicity, and he brings no special gifts to counterpoint and syncopation.  Let's face it--in the age of Korngold, there were a number of composers who could match his warmth of melody and wealth of talent for orchestration.  Steiner, Newman, even Friedhoffer (to cite a few of them)--these composers were deeply imaginative and could write strong thematic cross-references and rippling contrapuntal melodies.  However, in the age of John Williams there is only--sadly--John Williams.  And the epic film needs the epic musical imagination.  Giacchino does not have it.  He is a yeoman composer who can, rarely,scale the heights--but not this time.  His last decent attempt at this kind of \\"epic\\" was for a Jurassic Park video game--for which, by the way, he wrote a fine score.  As Williams cannot write for every epic, directors need to be more thoughtful about who can achieve the equal of Tolstoyan majesty in music for their Tolstoyan directorial efforts.  Abrams (damn near Tolstoyan in his first ST and more Sidney Sheldonesque in ST2, and positively Goofyesque in 8MM) likes to stick by his \\"man\\" and, in this, he has made the fateful error.

B00C33M2EE|5.0|The PianoGuys music has that unspoken quality that just can't be expressed in words... Music that is fun, entertaining, and uplifting. Music that makes you feel better. Music that inspires and uplifts. It is powerful...and at the same time, very calming.<br />This music is obviously something my wife and I enjoy listening to... But at the same time, we have two teenage daughters that also love listening to it. Granted, they don't listen to it all the time, but it is something that is on their regular playlists along with their dance music of course! But I can tell you, it is always nice knowing they're listening, at least some of the time, to this inspiring and positive music!<br />I highly recommend this CD, and any of the PianoGuys other music for that matter.
B008EKON56|5.0|has a 1/8 out and a micro usb. i am not sure what the micro usb is for but it doesnt detract.  i use this with a Fiio E11 amp and my iphone sounds good, but do not use this with just the line out to your headphones.  this bipasses the volume control meaning you cant control the volume on your headphones unless it has a volume control or you are using an amp.  but sound quality it good and i have no complaints. if someone could explain what the micro usb does i'd appreciate it, the thing didnt come with a manual...

B000OLRH10|4.0|good movie well written good acting, if this is what happens because of the diamond trade it needs to stop
B009NY43NY|3.0|This is definitely not the most exciting and suspenseful Sookie story, it wraps some loose ends up nicely, but leaves others lacking. Of course, since its the last of the series, you have to read it anyway.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Gratitude and thanks go to Brandon for taking on the monumental task of completing the compelling saga that Robert started so long ago.  A brilliantly conceived and executed story that will live on in the hearts and minds of all who read it, bringing adventure and heroism into the lives of generations to come.<br /><br />This is a story of how six young adults, ranging from ages 16 to early twenties, are swept up in events that compel them on an accelerated path into adulthood, during perilous times that could lead to the destruction of the world.  Having both shared and individual experiences and adventures, that develop unexpected skills and talents, they finally come together, with many others, to find a solution for saving mankind.<br /><br />Robert Jordan writes with great detail, bringing such rich texture and color to the story, both in general and in the individual characters, that you feel more like a participant in  rather than just a reader of the tale.
B000W796OM|5.0|MY SON LOVES HARRY POTTER.  THESE MOVIES ARE UNLIKE ANY OTHERS.  THIS IS HOURS OF THOUGHT PROVOKING, INTELLECTUAL FUN FOR KIDS, I HEAR ADULTS TOO.  MY SON HAS THE ENTIRE COLLECTION THAT I SPENT MONTHS BUYING OFF OF AMAZON.  IT WAS WORTH IT.  MOST OF THE TIME I DEALT WITH THE SAME COMPANIES.  DVD'S ARRIVED AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. BRAND NEW PACKAGING,  PLAYED EXCELLENTLY.
B00499NHLC|3.0|Less than stellar acting and writing. No comparison to shows like &#34;The Mentalist&#34; or &#34;Lie to Me&#34;. Then again, one man's garbage is another man's gold.
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved this book. Very intriguing that Mr. Christian Grey. I couldn't put it down from the first book to the last!
B007REV4YI|4.0|Im not going to Lie, skyfall was a big disapointment for me the first time i saw it in theatre, but then i purchased the movie (as i have all the bonds) and had to put it in the collection even though i wasnt crazy about the movie. First lets talk about what i didnt care for with this movie, Some spoilers (((ALERT))) AGE: Daniel Craig still feels new to me as a Bond, and in this movie there are multiple references to him getting older and \\"loosing a step\\" I didnt care for this at all as i feel like we as the viewers are still getting to know Craig as Bond. #2 Gadgets: As a little boy (im 37 now) i remember watching Bond movies with my dad and the super cool gadgets are half of what made the movies, this movie he gets a pistol and a radio that frankly looked like it was out of a 70's bond movie.. & The Bond girl felt forced, like there was a requirement to have a bond girl so they made a spot for her and she lasted all of 5 minutes in the movie.. And the Villion.. a X double 00 agent, I wish we had more information on him and his back story as well, its hardly mentioned.  I feel like Casino was a great start, quantum tied up the loose ends of Cassino and we were seeing the new James Bond come into his own as a newly promoted 00 agent, then in Skyfall he's portrayed as the aging, not truly up to the task anymore agent.. I feel like a movie or 3 were skipped.<br /><br />The Good: I loved that they threw the old Aston Marton in this movie, I truly like that this movie had some Humor to it and it was'nt so dark like Quantum, I also truly loved the old train station becoming the new MI6. Our meeting Money Penny and getting her \\"field\\" back story was very ,very cool.  After watching this movie 5-6 times now i understand what the writer/director was doing and i respect it.. I like the movie, i just think they could have done it a little better in the mentioned area's.
B00005AWMF|5.0|SHE HAD HER OWN STYLE.  A DIFFERENT KIND OF SOUL.  BACK IN THE DAY SOUND.<br />Shipped in proficient time. CD arrived ahead of schedule. No damage.  Packaged really well.  Played excellently in my car stereo.  Bought back memories.  Have purchased from this company many times. Will continue the relationship.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|The language of flowers is a beautifully written story of learning to love and be loved.  I would definitely recommend it.
B009LHWEKW|5.0|My husband and I were big X-Files fans and have been looking for something like it ever since it ended. Supernatural is the show that comes the closest to X-files feel, with great main characters and both fun and more serious story lines. We love it, and so does our teen daughter.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|A very suspenseful novel full of twists and turns and much intrigue.  Holds your interest and attention until the very last page.
1451695187|4.0|This is a compelling personal story with some interesting turns and insights. I read this almost cover to cover (cover to half way and half way to cover) on 2 recent flights, and I am pleased that I had a chance to share in Eben's experience.
B000RH0C8G|5.0|Love this book. It's well-written and thoughtful. The Oakland A's changed the face of baseball. This alone makes it interesting reading.
B00932A4XE|3.0|movie was okay, jumped around too much, had some really funny parts, but then also had alot of the same ole things from other movies.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I think this app is really helpful and cool. Now I know how much battery I've used, how much is left and how long it would take to charge it before the battery dies.It also tells me how long I can play games, to on the internet or go on Skype, it also tells me how long I can read books and much more.It's always in my notification box when I'm on my kindle. I go on it about once a day. Whoever is reading this,I totally recommend this app.
B0063M22QO|4.0|HI,I JUST STARTED TO PLAY THIS GAME.SO FAR IT IS VERY SPECIAL LOVE THE ADVENTURE AND I HOPE YOU ARE HAVING A GREAT TIME PLAYING TOO.INVITE YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY MEMBERS AND CHALLENGES WILL BE A WONDERFUL WAY TO SPEND TIME WITH YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY MEMBERS.

B00CM6ZLG8|5.0|I never really paid attention to Demi Lovato before the \\"X Factor\\", but after purchasing her \\"Unbroken\\" album, I have grown to appreciate her vocal abilities, and her incredible ability to convey emotion.  She seems to have grown with her newest release, \\"Demi\\", and I look forward to following her career in the future!
B00CBKLO52|3.0|I think I'll enjoy playing around with this, but I doubt it'll be a lifetime keeper.  I've definitely had some fun with this.  There's nothing quite like a steep climb followed by a nose dive and hopeful recovery.  Hey, it's digital.  You newer TRULY die.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|A real page turner to the very last sentence. Read this and feel your palms sweat.  Corey at his best!
B004A8ZWW4|4.0|It is a great Disney type Family Movie. I will be showing it to my Grandkids when they get older.
0374214913|5.0|My Take<br />This was a lighthearted joy and should appeal especially to anyone interested in fonts, typography, books, bookstores, and computer coding! And if you want to know how this all works together, well, you'll just have to read it!<br /><br />A little bit love and a little bit computer coding all wrapped up in a mysterious conspiracy. One that's been operating for centuries with groups struggling to decode the clues. It's a conflict between traditionalists and computer geeks. The geeks will enjoy the descriptions of Clay's playing and the atmosphere and excitement at the Google campus. I know I did...! Well, I also enjoyed Mat's artistic efforts. My fingers kept itching to get into the studio!<br /><br />I did enjoy Clay's virtual partying.<br /><br />About the whiniest I can get is wishing that Sloan had teased us along more when Corvina campaigned against Penumbra on the phone with Clay.<br /><br />There's nothing deep about this, other than the bit of ending philosophy. The characters are a sendup of their respective age and interest groups, all mixed in with a plunging economy.<br /><br />Festina lente...<br /><br />The Story<br />It's an odd bookstore with a few books in the front for the average customer off the streets while the Waybacklist (shades of Peabody and Sherman!) is the true purpose of the store with its arcane books that may only be borrowed.<br /><br />It's Clay's curiosity that sets things off after he meets a Google coder and wants to impress. Only he's too impressive to the wrong people.<br /><br />The Characters<br />Clay Jannon is desperate for a job and just that bit too curious. He has a background in design and computer coding and a definite interest in marketing. Matthew Mittelrand is one of his roommates and a special effects artist at Industrial Light and Magic. Ashley Adams is a fellow roommate and their landlady.<br /><br />Neel Shah is his best friend--the typical high-school-nerd-turned-millionaire with Anatomix. Even better is the type of coding on which he made his fortune--boys everywhere will be drooling, LOL! Neel hires guys like the young Russian hacker, Igor.<br /><br />Ajax Penumbra appears to own the bookstore and has some very odd requirements, such as the logbook. An interesting bit of history. Oliver Grone is a graduate student at UC Berkeley, studying archeology; he handles the afternoon shift. If it's before 1200, Oliver knows it.<br /><br />Some of the bookstore's customers include:<br />Maurice Tyndall; Fedorov worked at HP; Imbert; Rosemary Lapin is a retired programmer from the olden days; Monsef; Greg (he's also a hardware engineer at Google); and, Muriel the goat farmer.<br /><br />Clark Moffatt was another of Penumbra's customers. He was also the author of The Dragon-Song Chronicles---with a mystery in the third volume that Clay solves. It's a little bit Paul is dead...<br /><br />Tabitha Trudeau runs the California Museum of Knitting Arts and Embroidery Sciences. She has access! Cheryl represents Consolidated Universal Long-Term Storage LLC on the phone.<br /><br />Google<br />Kat is a programmer who specializes in data visualization. She eats, sleeps, and breathes code for Google. Jad runs the Book Scanner. Raj is one of those brilliant coders who'd probably flunk Social 101. Others involved in the decoding include Prakesh and Amy.<br /><br />Grumble is a programming hacker breaking DRM code.<br /><br />The FLC Company hiding the Unbroken Spine<br />They worship Aldus Manutius and his trusted friend, Griffo Gerritszoon. There are three levels within the society: the novice, the unbound, and the bound who have produced their codex vitae. Eric is the little jerk pulling Clay's chain. Marcus Corvina is the First Reader. Edgar Deckle is another former student of Penumbra's. Now he guards the Reading Room.<br /><br />The Cover<br />The cover is a white background with a grid of stacked and leaning books in yellow with a script slanting the title across it. Rather computer-like...<br /><br />The title is to the point, for it is Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore.puter-like...<br /><br />The title is to the point, for it is Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore.
B004XVMCPI|5.0|I loved the character \\"Golden Leg\\" and his misfortune.  I liked the Shaolin super fight scenes and each of the players mystical power.  I liked the humor, it made my side hurt.  I liked the super kicks, the iron head, the iron shirt, the steel leg, and the tai chi goalie.  How cool is this movie?  Super cool.
B002ZG976U|5.0|Christina Aguilera was amazing ! Her voice is incredible!! Cher was great too! Singing, dancing - all amazing! Loved it! Its one I can watch over and over. It was crazy humorous at times! I'm a huge fan of Stanley Tucci ! He makes the movie hilarious!
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|moved from time to time without any reason  Hard to understand dialog. Tom hanks was an ok actor again as usual
B0067EKYVI|4.0|The first hour seemed a little lost and slow but after that, the film gets better and better. Leonardo Di Caprio shines as Jay Gatsby and Carey Mulligan is superbly sultry as Diasy. Their chemistry is sizzling. The film bears the unmistakable OTT trademark of Baz Lurmann and his penchant for tragic endings (Romeo+Juliet, Moulin Rouge). The songs that appear on the film's soundtrack make more sense when featured in the film. In any case, this is a film adaptation of a literary classic and it's impossible to move everything on screen but it serves its purpose to entertain and perhaps, quickly educate the new generation unfamiliar with Fitzgerald.
193700788X|1.0|The series has been going downhill for the last several books and not just the storyline. The quality of the writing is getting worse and worse. Harris was never a great author, she definitely had better ideas than skills to execute them on paper, but this is amateurish. What's up with the change from 1st person to 3rd? 1st person always limited the books story telling scope, but really? She figured that out and changed it for the last book?! And then changed it just for the parts that she wants? Yuck!  The beginning, the middle, and the end all were crap. Maybe I will have a wobbly table that needs leveling sometime and put this book to the best use possible. Or maybe I'll need some paper to get a campfire started sometime. A much better use of the paper than what Charlaine Harris and her publisher did with the paper. Is there a way to give it LESS than one star?
B002VECM6S|5.0|Love this true story. I have always loved sports movies and the feel good feeling the inspirational movies give you.. but this one is above and beyond. I would love to meet Leigh Ann - I think our communities need more women like her.<br />I work with children in the welfare system and If more people were like her, what a wonderful world it would be !
B00AOCLWF6|4.0|If you like sci-fi and creepy crawlies, then Falling Skies is must see TV. It's not perfect, but it's entertaining and compelling once you get into it.
B00AIBZM40|1.0|Seriously?  \\"Horror\\" movies are being ruined by CGI.  This could have been a good movie if it didn't play like a cartoon 3/4 of the way in.  Whatever happened to real psychological thrillers like \\"The Exorcist,\\" that didn't need all this computer generated mess to (try and) impress?  You can't blame the actors, but this movie is a waste of money.
0316227706|5.0|I bought 4 of these, one for each of my grown kids & their families and kept one for myself. The Grandkids love this book!  Fantastic photography.  A nice coffee table book to share with company.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Read the book & it has more detail than the movie. I was not impressed w/ the amazon on demand, kept freezing up.
007174889X|5.0|The book is thorough, yet doesn't waste your time putting in more lenght than what you need to understand the complex. The pragmatism imbued in the writing style of this book makes it a pleasure to read and easy to find the information you're looking for. As a medical student, I've found it extremely helpful in quickly finding and comprehending information.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I feel like I was cheated.  What a sloppy final book.  The last two books weren't fantastic, but this was just pathetic.
B00AJAFNIA|4.0|This game is absolutely addictive. I enjoy playing it and so do my 3 boys, ages 4, 7, and 8.  The only problem I have is that it will pause, or kinds freeze for a second or two, which can totally throw your game off.
1476734941|4.0|The book gives new life to an old idea (in some cultures and religions).  The relief is that fasting does not leave you ravenous.<br />It actually helps with self control.  Many of the meal suggestions are quite delicious.
B00AWJYJVA|1.0|The book is  no pun intended, corny. It is sad that the author of so many tightly written books should have allowed himself the indulgence of this time wasting exercise.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love the game. I would like things to not be so expensive coin or nut-wise but still play it several times a day.
B00BPXKWGS|3.0|I was a little surprised when I found out that \\"Green\\" was going to get the box-thingy reissue treatment.  I was sorta hoping that REM had the sense to not \\"go there\\" - that is, tackle the long expanse between '88 and the end of the Bill Berry years, the time period in which REM went from a punk juggernaut to downright imperial. I would have settled for the first third of the REM story to be the end of the revisionism and revisitation. But here it is, \\"Green\\" in the limelight for the first time since we were telling Dan Quayle jokes, and its surprise reappearance causes a not-so painful reflection of how much a dud this album has become over time.<br /><br />Full disclosure (no pun intended): by 1988 I had become a devotee of the rapidly-congealing classic late-80's DC/Dischord sound, with such canonical punk bands as Fugazi and so forth on my plate. I had abandoned any hope for what passed as \\"80's alternative\\" (the Camper Van Beethovens, They Might Be Giantses, and other assorted mundane \\"college acts\\") to do anything beyond soundtracking frat parties. Much of what passed for 80's alternative rock didn't \\"move me\\" - with Dream Syndicate's mind-numbingly bland \\"Medicine Show\\" being a classic example. Up against this horrid backdrop of sellout pop, an era in which even REM's \\"Document\\" appeared like a dropped bomb, I retreated to gut-check politics, postpunk scenesterism, and the joys of overloaded Marshall amps. So when REM returned as a major-label act, I was initially excited. And I did in fact purchase \\"Green\\" on day one (at Peaches Records, on cassette).<br /><br />Sadly, I defy anyone with ears and a sense of history to make it through this peculiar, uneven album. The songwriting is not necessarily horrible, but hardly brilliant, and rarely do any of the songs truly challenge. I am willing to concede that, for the Camper Van Beethoven/10,000 Maniacs crowd of 1989, songs like \\"Get Up\\" and \\"Turn You Inside Out\\" might have been inspiring and eye-opening, but for me, they were faulty proclamations of world-ism that didn't even register as intriguing songs. \\"Pop Song '89\\" and \\"Stand\\", it goes without saying, caused me to wonder what in the heck they had been spending time working on for a year if that's what they were offering. \\"You Are the Everything\\" has an intriguing backstory, but the lyrics sink it; \\"Hairshirt\\" wanders aimlessly, a boutique piece and a wasted melody. And the sound of the album was just pedestrian: the drums, in particular, seemed slick and lifeless, the heavily-treated guitar unnecessary (contrary to popular belief, \\"Orange Crush\\" does not \\"rock\\"), and the arrangements veering on novelty (a trend that would be sadly maximized on their next album). The peak example of this vanilla-zation is undeniably the last, untitled track: it has nagged me for years that, had this song been from the \\"Reckoning\\" era, it probably would have been a real scorcher; but as part of \\"Green\\", it's as exciting as dinner at Applebees.<br /><br />There was some dorm-room discussion at the time that Michael Stipe was suffering from writers' block, with the worst of \\"Green\\" as hard evidence. At the time, I found it not-so ironic that the only lyrics printed on the cover were of the album's best track, the sublime \\"World Leader Pretend\\", which channeled their newfound globalism right. And hats off to \\"The Wrong Child\\" (one of the most transcendent, kudzu-draped tracks they've ever recorded, their \\"Across The Universe\\") and \\"I Remember California\\" (the first of many truly rocking dirge-tastic odes to the road beneath) for being outstanding. But for me, \\"Green\\" is remembered as the first of a series of records by a band that earned the right to be grandiose, even pompous, and they ran with this newfound arrogance. They had \\"arrived\\", I guess, as evidenced by the generic-sounding Greensboro live show contained here (if ever there was a reissue that could have benefited from the perspective of outtakes, this was it, but we get an arenalive show???). \\"Green\\" was a real head-scratcher, just like this reissue, and for REM the skyrocketing success would also entail a new sense of musical universalism that left many long-time fans like myself looking elsewhere for a more hard-edged take on the same worldview. Peter Buck said at the time, and I'm paraphrasing, that he understood the impulse for older fans to lose interest in the \\"new\\" REM and \\"follow the Butthole Surfers instead\\" or something like that. I was one of those folks, and 25 years hasn't changed my opinion of \\"Green\\" and its fatal flaws.live show???). \\"Green\\" was a real head-scratcher, just like this reissue, and for REM the skyrocketing success would also entail a new sense of musical universalism that left many long-time fans like myself looking elsewhere for a more hard-edged take on the same worldview.

B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Silver Linings Playbook chronicles a young man's descent into mental illness (bipolar disorder).  Bradley Cooper's performance as the manic, violent, out of control lead character is spot on in depicting what it is like for a family dealing with someone with a major mental illness, especially one who is non-compliant in terms of taking medication to control the symptoms.  I loved Jennifer Lawrence's character and her effect on Cooper's life.  Painful and funny and true.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is one of the best books that I have ever read. From the first page this story holds your attention as it describes what it is like to have a child of yours accused of a murder. This story describes the experiences of a prosecutor whose son is dragged through the court system and the social consequences to the family.

B004EPYZZ8|5.0|What an inspiring and true story to motivate us all to overcome anything and pursue our dreams! Well made-good acting. Family friendly. Show to your group at church or school.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|I love the whole premise of this film, based upon the novel by David Mitchell.  In it, several people meet and part, meet and part, lifetime after lifetime, in order to learn to value life and value love.  The roles they play shift as they change -- sometimes they are the oppressor, sometimes the oppressed. Sometimes they kill.  Sometimes they are killed.  They gain and they lose.  Although some of the characters remain monstrous throughout their repeated lifetimes, most evolve over time.  Those are the characters whose lives matter most because of the ripples their presence sends out into the water of life. They change, and the world changes.<br /><br />This film is a beautiful metaphor for karma and eventual enlightenment.
B009RH9FR6|2.0|I was looking forward to being able to use the rotating feature on this Kindle case.  No matter what I tried, it just doesn't work.  The instructions included was useless. At one time trying to figure this out, the Kindle fell out onto the floor.  It didn't seem to hurt the Kindle but it scared me.

They are used at a key point in the heist.<br /><br />The movie itself is, as I said, quite fun to watch especially if you like heist movies.  I found that it held my attention with its action.  (There was little CGI in this movie.)<br /><br />The acting is quite good especially by Seth Green, Jason Statham, Edward Norton, and Donald Sutherland.  Mark Wahlberg is the straight man and mastermind in this movie.<br /><br />Also, look for Spiderman and Ukranians in this movie.<br /><br />The background music is also quite good.  It adds to each scene.<br /><br />Note that despite this movie's title, only a small part of it occurs in Italy (Venice).  The majority of the action takes place in Los Angeles.<br /><br />When the movie appears to end and the end credits start rolling, don't exit.  This movie continues a bit into the end credits.<br /><br />Finally, the DVD itself (Full Screen Edition released in 2003) has six extras.  All of them are interesting.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you like heist movies and escapism, then this is one movie you have to see!!<br /><br />(2003;  1 hr 45 min excluding some end credits;  full screen;  16 scenes)<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Stephen PLETKO, London, Ontario, Canada>><br /><br />XXXXXsee!!<br /><br />(2003;  1 hr 45 min excluding some end credits;  full screen;  16 scenes)<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Stephen PLETKO, London, Ontario, Canada>><br /><br />XXXXX
B000050XEI|5.0|When hearing this album for the first time, I was immediately entranced by the music. It sounded so different from anything I heard in the past. Immediately, I decided to buy the album right away! And since then, I have not regretted it.<br /><br />To me, the music displayed here was exceptionally beautiful. It went through my veins, reached into my soul and put a subtle calm feeling I just can't describe. I never knew music could make me feel this way...a bunch of emotions attacking me at once. At first, I thought something was wrong with me! And yet, once I thought about it...I realized only true artists are capable of doing that to a person. And Miss Enya  is truly a gifted artist.<br /><br />Within this album, each track had its own indidivual story, its different style of music, and its own impact within the listeners' hearts. Personally, I just loved the effort she put into this album. You can tell she put her heart and soul into it, which makes the music much more enjoyable to listen too if you ask me.<br /><br />I loved this album very much. I can't find myself skipping a single track, the quality of it is extremely high from start to finish.<br /><br />Overall, a terrific album to own for any Enya fan.

B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Best movie i've seen in years!  It will draw you in.  I didn't expect how much I would like these flawed characters.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is the best creative and awsome game I have ever played since I had back my privilege to play again
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|Best movie ever. I couldn't look away. It was that good. Going to watch again soon. A must see movie
B000FCK8ZK|4.0|Very good book..but I liked the TV series better.A good guy who kills the bad guys that he knows are guilty.
1932735410|5.0|Easy to follow chapters with great writing and explains things clearly. Have found this to be most helpful in studying for  the exam.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love this game. Such a fun addidicting game. a little slow at the very first but gets good pretty quick.
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|The game is a cute, fun game.  It is not so hard that it is unsolvable but not do easy that it is boring.  I am glad I purchased.
B00A83075M|5.0|My grandson loves this movie and sometimes asks to watch it every day so that is the reason I'm giving it 5 stars.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|this app is so addictive you don't realize that several hours have gone past.  I would recommend it to everyone
B001DPHDCY|4.0|nice graphics, really nice for my four year old grandson great art and thanks for making something suitable for children
0783228457|5.0|I watched it the first time in the 1980's when it came out. it is a great movie to watch while under the influence of psychedelics.
1475143389|5.0|This book is wonderful. If you have been working out for a while, like me, then you will learn so much after reading it. The diet information is especially helpful for me. Before I read this book, I wasn't very concerned with my diet. I would just gulf down all the meat I found, drank whey, and other sources of protein like eggs, cottage cheese, etc. I now know that diet is fundamental. Also my workout routine did not include real heavy lifting. I would do bench press, of course, but never touched deadlift or even squats! I figured I didn't really care about my legs and would just get a jacked torso. Thanks to Mike's book, I have made very significant gains. Thanks Mike!
B008VVT51U|5.0|Great acting<br />wonderful storyline<br />poignant<br />Beautiful scenery<br />Who doesn't love Judi Dench and Maggie Smith?<br />Lovely movie all together -- recommended!
B009YU9J0E|4.0|Great music, just wish they didn't sidechain the kick so much...  ducking so much like that gets a bit repetitive... let the mix breath!!
0525953728|5.0|I couldn't put this book down it was that good as soon as I finish it I sent it to my mom who is as avid a reader as I am
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My horse is a fun and interesting game, but when you buy a another horse nothing is different, just the way they look. Plus it's so hard to get gems! I recommend this game if you want the same thing every time you play.
B004EYRIBC|5.0|Exactly What I was looking for! I'm not an audiophile so I'm not looking for the highest bit rate or So but this definitely meets my criteria for all the music in the series!
B00BI5IXL4|3.0|as in the live-streaming movie was just fine. However, the movie was quite mixed. I thought that some of the actors/actresses were great, but the live singing (except for that by Anne Hathaway) was pretty awful. I thought Russel Crowe was dreadful. And I thought the staging and the filming itself were pretty bad. All in all...a few great moments, a lot of mediocre moments. The movie was just okay...which is a shame because the stage play I saw 25 years ago was phenomenal.
B008O69SZ0|5.0|Ian Hunter has out done himself again on this his latest recording it has some of his best song writing and the songs are instant classics
B0031RS2HC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. In fact I found it hard to put down and do regular life things.<br />Captivating from the beginning. Worth the action packed read.
1451668945|3.0|I received a Kindle Fire for mother's day and have not read this book yet.  I would like to return it for the Kindle edition.  I have tried thru e-mail to Amazon to correct this matter.  I am a tremendious fan of Mary Higgins Clark and love all of her books.  That is why I ordered this book.  I hope this note get to the right place.
B0042816YK|5.0|Love this movie.  It is something you could watch more than once and still enjoy.  Julia Roberts is such a good actress.
B008383GE8|5.0|An absolutely brilliant book from a brilliant man. It was highly informative and was not confusing for me at all. Understandable and a brilliant read.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I read this book for a book club with no idea of what it was about. I was surprised many times and completely addicted until I got to the end. I did not give it 5 stars because I did not like the ending. After so cleverly developing everything, the author quickly slapped together an unbelievable ending
B00622B3MY|5.0|We love this movie! Yes, it is a little more grown up than the first and I agree that some of the language and references aren't the best but what most people don't say in their reviews is that the lesson is learned in the end.  I think that was one of the best parts of the movie.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I'm so happy to have discovered that this show is on Amazon.  I had caught a few episodes here and there, but watching in order is so much better.  The show presents interesting cases amongst the backdrop of the aftermath of infedelity and possible political scandal.  I am hooked.
B0031RSA24|5.0|I have a huge amount of respect for Sir Richard Dawkins, his works and tireless attitude towards his writing and educating others is something I truly admire. Reading this book completely changed my life and opened up my mind and eyes to my brainwashing as a child from my religious upbringing and enabled me to finally admit to myself the truth about my beliefs. I highly recommend this book from this fantastic man . It might just change your life too !
B001KWN6ZS|5.0|Besides being an unbelievable talent, this selection of songs and music was so super... If you like the acoustic versions of songs, you will be in love with this album. I consider this one of the best pieces of work that he has put together.
B00CM6ZLG8|5.0|I bought it the day it came out! I am obsessed with it! I can't put it down!<br />I can't really seem to get past Two Pieces and Really Don't Care. Trying to though. LOL But all of the songs are amazing! Demi is my hero. She's such an inspiration. She has a beautiful voice and she is a beautiful person. You will be blessed with this album. A truly talented artist.<br />Every word has emotion and meaning behind it. I love it. All Lovatics should buy it :)
B009NY43NY|5.0|Sad to see Sookie go but I'm not disappointed in the ending at all!  What a great way to end a fabulous series. Thanks Charlaine Harris!!
B009LHJYA0|5.0|These guys rock and never miss a beat. This album reminds me of a mix between Enigma and One Nation Underground. The first few tracks start off really heavy and then the album finishes off with the great melodic mixes that my girlfriend would actually listen to. Highly recommended!
B0098VXMNE|5.0|This is a series that I so wanted to continue regardless of historical accuracy. It was a heartbreaking show to finally see end. I will order all of the seasons so that I can watch these beautiful and talented actors and actresses over and over.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|just a lot of fun looking around and playing relaxing,have to think a little ,need more games like the room
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This was a fun game to play.  Good graphics, great fantasy-unreal world, fun puzzles to solve.  I liked the evil plants.  Keep up the good work, your games are the best!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|If you liked season 1 of this show, you will love season 2!  I chose five stars because I loved it so much.  I stayed up early in the morning to find out what happened next.  Great show!
B0043UB0EI|5.0|There's just too much to say about this whole show. WOW!!! Fantastic!! Though some may have thought it too much, I disagree, please, bring on more nudity!!
B0095P31L6|5.0|great family movie... 3 yr old and 2 yr old grand kids love it. great story for adults and interesting characters for kids
0823015017|5.0|This is a terrific book that has lots of ideas to help me with my interest in polymer clay jewelry! i look forward to trying various techniques! Thanks!
193700788X|5.0|I am sad that this series is ending, but I loved the characters and am happy it ended the way it did.  Good job Charlaine Harris!
B005MMYBXI|5.0|This story had so many great characters. Some real, some fictional. The acting was fantastic. I got caught up in so many of them. Their dialog was wonderful.
B000IDEORY|5.0|What can I say? This movie is a keeper forever. There's nothing more to say. You've got to see it!
B00915G6WQ|3.0|have all the previous seasons, but...this one is disappointing...Dexter looks tired and lacks enthusiasm. all good things must end. so sad, even in real life. save money wait for rentals to go on sell before buying.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Wowwwww !!! I TRULY LOVED THIS GAME I GOT OBSESSED THE MOMENT I BOUGHY IT, I COULDN'T STOP PLAYING AND I WAS SAD WHEN THE GAME WAS OVER !!! I'd love to have more games like this one =)
B000IZ4R1U|5.0|I've watched this more then once, so during a long break in jury duty, I watched it again.  Before I finished, I had 3 people looking over my shoulder also enjoying the movie.  They were surprised that the movie was action packed and so much fun. Even on a small screen,  we all enjoyed watching it and the wonderful break from reality it gave us all. I recommend it as a fun action adventure movie and gave it 5 fun stars.
B0035XVVDY|5.0|What a surprising movie. I would watch it again and again. Very interesting and great acting. A must see for you!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I love all the cut the ropes and I was excited to try this and I'm glad I did. It was worth the money.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game is good. It cheats at times,but it keeps my 3 & 4 year old niece and nephew occupied for hours. So,it is definitely worth having. I like the challenges.it's a good game in my opinion.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|A really great story. Well worth reading. I really enjoyed it and hope to see more along the same line.
023076651X|5.0|This book has changed the way I look at my potential and the possibilities of an independent career. Chris Guillebeau is accessible, funny and engaging and his insight is visionary.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I was not a huge fan of this book.  I think the author tried to hard to keep the reader guessing, but I didn't find anything that happened all that surprising.  My response was always, &#34;of course that just happened, because this book is crazy!.&#34;  I normally speed through books of this length in 3-4 days, and this book took me 2 weeks to complete.  I think what ruined this book for me, is that I ended up hating both of the main characters.  I wasn't rooting for either of them while I was reading, so I think that killed it for me.  Don't get me wrong, it's not a terrible read, just not my favorite.
1400067820|5.0|Read this book for its entertainment value (\\"oh no, he didn't!\\"), not for its mathematical rigor. ;)<br /><br />Taleb's stories, thoughts, anecdotes, definitions brought into my field of vision the parts of the universe both critical to my experience, and largely invisible.<br /><br />Time will tell, of course, but some of Taleb's thoughts seem quite brilliant to me, and I, personally, expect them to impact our education, business practices, legal system, engineering, etc.<br /><br />Regardless of what you will think of Taleb's conclusions, I would be surprised (esp. since you got this far;) if you don't find his topics and discussion fascinating (and entertaining;).
B003G4W49C|2.0|It's a really boring book.  I love science fiction but this one is just way too complicated and it takes much too long to actually get into the story.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I love this guy's words and music.  He's the<br />real deal and his words come straight from the heart.<br />No strange metaphors to wade through like Dylan,<br />just the cold facts all set to beautiful lyrics that linger<br />in your head.
B0091REZMW|2.0|I think that this app has a lot of potential, but the writing is so small that you need a magnifying glass. Someone clearly did not think this through.
B009IF8CH6|4.0|First off, I probably would have liked it much better if I hadn't read a spoiler alert.  I knew what to expect and even though it was still a good episode I was kinda put off about a comment made by Amy about Raj.  The poor guy is making progress and I hope to see more of it in the coming new season.  I love BBT and all its quirky characters.
B008220D7S|1.0|I feel the producers owe me an hour and a half of my life back. This was advertised as &#34;laugh out loud funny&#34; and it was anything but. There were a few laughs but over-all one of the worst movies I have seen. The only good parts are if you think Megan Fox is sexy. You get to see her in bra and pnties and a skimpy bikini. I would not recommned buying this movie at all.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|This guy is the best, a well-kept secret.  A superb<br />songwriter -- a lot like Dylan, but his words make<br />sense and they come from the heart.  Outstanding.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I have played Mahjong games like this for years on a desktop computer, loved it so much that I played until I conquered all the options. Glad to get to play  now  on my kindle.<br /><br />cpht4@hotmail.com
B00CC1JXYE|3.0|Overall:<br />This is case has a nice feel and the leather is soft. I like this better than the Samsung version of the S-View cover. The screen is clear and the cover works as described. The reason this case does not get 5 stars is because the top and bottom of the edges of the phone (short edges) are not protected at all. From my past experience, this is where the contact to a nice hard surface (like concrete) will occur.<br /><br />In short, if you are careful with your phones (like my wife) this case is great. If you are like me, and it will likely fall, this case may not be what you are looking for.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Nice wrap around leather case<br />-Light weight<br />-Comfortable to use<br />-Feels like a quality case<br />-Phone is protected on sides (long edges)<br />-Case serves as a stand, with caveat (below)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Does not protect the top and bottom edges (short edges) of the phone<br />-Flap does not hold itself down (like the iPad cover).<br />-The flip cover is great to hold the phone as a stand, but there is no groove to keep it there, so you have to use a flat surface and carefully place the phone to keep it in place
B003WE9TU8|3.0|It certainly wasn't what I expected. Its just like a series of reports from various people. I couldn't get involved with characters as there are none.I found it rather tedious.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|The casting of this movie was spot on...The manerisms of each character are truly portrayed by each actor and believable as the &#34;younger&#34; versions of each original cast memeber...Truly enjoyed watching...
0060191325|5.0|I was very surprised by this book.  I thought I knew how men thought but I was so wrong.  I could have never guessed at some of the things Dr. Gray explained about men.  And every time I've discussed it with men they have confirmed what he said.  I gave my copy to a friend and bought this one for another friend.  It's a book I'm going to make my children read before they can date.  I think it's that important.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game has been so. Enjoyable.  I play a lot of. HO games. This one is a 5 1/2 .
B0093H8H8I|5.0|Works that is all I can say.  It is as good as my I5 and just works.<br />I do not understand what the cores all do.<br />So my benchmarks are not way high.<br />It is just as fast in reality.<br />Why ever spend your money if it is<br />just not better on a daily basis.
B003B02O7I|5.0|I really liked this book, could hardly wait to finish it.  John Grisham is one of my favorite authors.<br />The ending was a surprise.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|My son and I love to play cut the rope together. Sometimes two heads are better than one. The music isn't annoying and the puzzles can be pretty challenging at times. We have a great time :-)
B008602KQI|5.0|Found this on the Amazon movies in my Prime Membership... Watched it again - a still great ride... Can't wait for the next one.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|It was good just a bit expected. I feel like I knew what was going to happen before I finished it
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Completely worth the $2.00! One of the Best games I have on my kindle. Can't wait for the new chapter.
B00CFAHSEO|5.0|To fully grasp what this artful music means to me I believe first requires a little background. I was born with a wonderful gift, the ability to play piano at the ripe age of 3. I went thru various phases from childhood thru my 20's, the likes of Elton John, Billy Joel, Journey, country music, and always with a base of music such as Arthur's Theme, Hill Street Blues, St Elmos Fire Love Theme, etc. I had gone quite a while without inspiration when in my late 20's or early 30's, I discovered David Benoit, whose style I learned to mimic quite well and whose music kept me delighted for years to come. Alas, not much of a creationist myself and more than tired of playing the same songs over and over again, and keeping busy with work and family, I lost my inspiration. For a guy who played professionally for a few years but for most of my life played for hours every single day just for pure enjoyment, lost inspiration was a travesty of epic proportion.<br /><br />Recently, I finally plopped down in front of the computer and started searching, and searching, listening to all kinds of clips, trying everything I could to find an artist to re-inspire me once again, to no avail, nothing struck the proverbial chord. Then, I got this email inviting me to register to win tickets to see The Piano Guys, and naturally, that title got my attention. So, I quickly found their website and was instantly breathless - finally, I had found for what I'd been looking for far too long!! Beautiful, artful melody, unique and wonderful interpretations of familiar songs, incredibly wonderful strings including my favorites, the cello and violin, blended beautifully with precisely my own style of piano playing. Yipppeee!!! And the videos on their website only make the music that much better! I bought these MP3 albums (both 1 & 2) so I could listen in the car, and everywhere I've gone since discovering this music only days ago, you can bet this stuff is cranked all the way!
0143038583|5.0|Don't read this book if you think the staus quo is fine when it comes to food. Just don't do it. If, on the other hand, you are open to thoughtful and (in my opinion) honest reflections about our food sources and how we choose to eat, then you can't afford not to have read this book. Michael Pollan has written a number of expose pieces, but I find this one the most important to me. After reading this, our diet changed and is changing. We are more informed about our choices, but not always able to implement them. Food is Medicine and how that plays into our lifestyle is not subtle. Be prepared to know more and less at the end of reading this. Highly recommended.
B0051BLT4O|4.0|Very personal, I felt she was in conversation with me. Resources listed at the end very valuable! Quick, smooth read.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I needed something to take my mind off reality. Much like 30 Rock this show...I mean book worked it's magic. It is a fun read and a good balance for reality. I came to love Tina Fey even more than I already do.

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Well, not much can be added to the plaudits given to Downton Abbey. We have watched the series twice from beginning to the current end and await the next installment. Certainly family friendly and Maggie Smith is thrilling in her portrayal. Always a treat.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|The book was very well written and a book I did not want to put down. It was very interesting.
B003ZSI7R2|5.0|This is a brillant debut album from a great talented band with a great singer, an absolute delight to listen to this albumfull of wonderful soul/blues/rock it doesn't get any better than this one of my favorite bands now.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The movie is very close to the book but I loved getting the internal thought process of every character and the detailed backstory.  I loved it.  A truly truly wonderful book. I'm starting the second one now.
B001XUY818|4.0|Pretty close to the way it happened. Just changed a few names. Johnny Depp plays the part perfect.  It really makes you feel sorry for a guy that was one of the largest drug dealers of all time.
B001FA0W5W|5.0|I get more out of Nassims books by reading articles  and books Taleb references. this book is best understood if read with the Black Swan and Antifragile . personally i have both read and listened to the excellent audible versions . the perspectives are valuable if one really spends the time , ie look at the three as texts in a smester course to really appreciat their value.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The characters were very interesting, and the pictures supplemented the story nicely. I can't wait for the sequel!
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|This is a quick paced and easy to do game. It is somewhat addictive, but it is not a mind-exercising game for the most part. I like to exercise my brain to keep it active as I age.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love having this on my tablet.  Have played on laptop for years.  I have several games I can take with me.  Like that I do not have to be on internet to play and enjoy.  Thnks.
B009FOBMBI|5.0|I am rating this album as awesome because it is last time that Adam will part of the group.  Heard TDG live and it was awful without Adam
B000HL09SA|5.0|This film is a classic family film that is funny, poignant, and endearing in all respects.<br />It is a wonderful story about a little boy who is given a puppy for his ninth birthday and the beginning of a great friendship between the two.  The story shows the developing character of the boy from child to boy to young man.  It is also insightful in respect to<br />race relations and segregation in the deep south in the 1940s.  The entire movie is<br />very well done with an excellent cast that consists of Luke Wilson, Kevin Bacon, Clint Howard and Frankie Muniz and other wonderful actors that I have never seen before.  They were outstanding.  This movie is a must see for the entire family.  Enjoy!
B009O2XY12|3.0|This is an easy game. It is relaxing and can be done while watching a television program that does not require full attention. However, after a short time it wants to you to purchase or the game is frozen.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love having this on my tablet.  Helps to relax after a long day.  Thanks that it does not need internet to run.
B00AAQWMB4|1.0|I might have liked it if it had directions as to what the motives were to play.  Had no idea what I was trying to do
B000TKZ3TO|4.0|There has never been a 6 hour version, But there has been a fan edit with more violent scenes edited back into this TV version that does 189 minutes with recaps of what happens on disc 1. When I first saw Dune I did not like it, but now have come to appreciate David Lynch's style and love this movie and the theatrical cut.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|True to it's usual self, I can find just about anything with Google. It is useful for many reasons. I think of all of those years before Google and the internet and how difficult it used to be to do research. I am grateful to be alive in such times,
0345803485|5.0|I got this book really fast in the mail and i just love it, it was in great condis thanks
B003LXM1RS|2.0|Thought this would have music to make me move to.  It was just loud and obnoxious.  For the hard core rocker
B0032KNA4I|5.0|Some movies were meant for HD and this is a perfect example, WOW does this movie POP in HD. The digital transfer is perfect from start to finish.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I just started trying this game out last night & had a great time. I don't totally have it figured out, but the part I started was fun and kept me on my toes.
030788743X|5.0|I havent read the book yet myself, but a friend suggested it. I am looking forward to getting into all of the wonderfully nerdy references and such inside.
B00004U2HK|5.0|The  video was in good condition and provided as much enjoyment as I received the first time I saw it.  Thank you.
B008J34466|5.0|Favorite song is true love and slut like you. awesome vocals by pink. also love the title track truth about love
B004UHL9EK|5.0|I had tried the free version and loved it so much I bought this version. Not really any difference other than the ads are gone. I also feel if someone develops something really good they deserve compensation.<br />I had been looking for a calendar for my Kindle Fire that would give a pop up reminder when I was reading but could not find anything that did what I wanted.<br />With this App I set an alarm and put what I want to be reminded of as the Label. At the specified time you get an alarm and it pops up over what you were reading on the screen so you view it. You can dismiss it or snooze to keep reminding you.<br />Also use it when doing laundry , very helpful to remind me when I need to go down to take out of washer or dryer.
0345803485|5.0|I am not a person that enjoys reading.  I purchased this based on friends insisting I read this.  Boy am I glad I finally listened to them!  It was a very easy book to read and I found myself not wanting to put it down.  I have already ordered the other two books in this trilogy and can't wait to read them!!!
0525478817|5.0|I must admit that I was a little put off at first when I initially learned about the plots.  Reading about Gus and Hazel makes my heart smiles and often forget that Gus is only 17.  It is a very powerful story and very emotional.  I could barely get through the last few chapters because I was a sobbing, crying fool.  I enjoyed the humors, the love story between Gus and Hazel, and the strength that held their family together through this rough time.  I would recommend this book, great read and you will fly through it rather quickly.<br /><br />Cheers!
B00CBRADU2|5.0|Its worth the purchase.Am just so happy to see Schwartz back in action, great movie, video and audio are just breath taking,
B0094K1PW4|3.0|A little slow at times, but the story line is worth waiting for. has a good ending and leaves you thinking.
B00CFITJKW|4.0|Great graphics. A lot of fun learning to fly using this flight sim. Took a couple of times to get down the correct speeds, etc. I come from a Boeing family, so I think this is a blast to play! All in all, well worth it, and it's a lot of fun!
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I'm addicted to this series.  I love the interaction between all the characters: fun, seriousness, sexual innuendo, childishness.  I have all 4 seasons and love watching the development of the relationships. Can't wait until season 5 comes out on DVD.
B00BKTFABE|2.0|This one came down ok and ran  --- but I could not &#34;get&#34; a way to save the snapped photos  .... I may have missed something !!
B009X2CRMK|3.0|I think I have overdosed on Kate Morton and made the mistake of reading too many of her books back to back. I'm going to lay off now as she seems to use a very formulaic method of writing and it gets a bit predictable. I found The Forgotten Garden very disappointing after The Keeper.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the read. Just enough twists to keep you wondering. But the ending?!? AWFUL!!! I mean completely horrible.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I'm addicted to this series.  I love the interaction between all the characters: fun, seriousness, sexual innuendo, childishness.  I have all 4 seasons and love watching the development of the relationships. Can't wait until season 5 comes out on DVD.
B009LGO88E|5.0|Good item. It just sucks that you have to order it overseas. Real easy to assemble. The extra grip makes holding the 3ds-xl real comfortable and the extra analog on the right is always a plus
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|Was really amazed by the storyline. Didn't realize until I watched the movie that it was based on true events of the past. Acting was absolutely outstanding by all, one that I wish I had watched on the big screen first!!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This is a great game. I would recommend it to anyone.<br />The graphics are incredible. It is not overly difficult, but is challenging
B000NQRE1E|5.0|This the best of all worlds, you get the  DVD & Blu Ray movie versions, also any & all the background-behind the scenes information you  can hope for. We have seen it on the big screen a couple of times, but this is the way to go on a nice HDTV in your own house. highly recommended.
B007IK44CK|5.0|It's nice to have the option to watch recent shows and movies with Amazon Prime!  Keep bringing more good shows and movies to the library.
B0032JTV6U|5.0|great condition, all the DVD's work, good price, it was enjoyable to rewatch the first season of glee and I'm happy with the price I got it at.
B0056TYT66|5.0|Received earlier than expected. Works as I expected. It gave new life to my older desktop. Most things run faster now.
0525952926|4.0|Winter of the World was engaging, and although it was a novel, it related a lot of historical information that everyone should be aware of regarding the genesis of Nazism and the limitations of socialism, as well as the devastating impact of war.
B00005CDNJ|5.0|I used to have this album on a cassette that a friend burned off of his computer, but then I lost it sometime ago, Having always enjoyed the music(especially the song &#34;OLD FRIENDS) I was really glad to find this c.d. at such a good price.
B00785P2QC|4.0|So far I like this game. Good time passer for night shift at work. Not much to say other than that. Get it if it is free like it was for me.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|Overall it was a great film you have to persist through the beginning it is slow and layered but the story ties itself together in the end and is rather entertaining!! The actors are brilliant and the interwoven stories are good. Definitely worth the watch.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Pretty scary... can't find the 8th page though :( the graphics a pretty darn good, works well on kindle fire. Very very cool... and it was only a buck. Great!
1451695195|5.0|Compelling and detailed presentation of a physician's personal experience at a time that, by modern medical standards, this physician's cerebral cortex was not functioning, as evidenced by brain function monitors in a critical care hospital.

0679735259|5.0|Wow &#34;Nam&#34;, through the eyes of a journalist, most journalists were wannabe Marines, Herr caught the true essence of the war, written from the Soul Herr , great job<br />J.Finn  2/9 USMC
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Love this series. Had read the books and find the film to be top-notch. Those who love fantasy, action and drama will be most pleased.
B009DZDJU6|5.0|Exciting, fast paced. Unique spin on Abe Lincoln. kept one guessing. Could have had more on Mrs. Lincoln part. Should have a part 2.
B000I9YXHY|5.0|Wow, Streisand is amazing in this role.  One of her best!  Great music, high energy will leave you with a smile.
B00BSJ2YVA|5.0|I'm listening to it right now and loving it. I can't believe how good they sound. For all those who liked the first album or 70's hard rock and heavy metal, you will love this. The second track Doomsday Machine sounds so Volume 4-ish I just LOVE IT! This album seems to show a lot more Led Zeppelin influence than the last which I also LOVE. The bands overall sound is much more varied and the riffs are more creative and original. Their first album was awesome, but this one is better.
B007WPLZAK|3.0|Visually stunning take on the raw emotion of war and love, and the anticipation of peace. This movie was rented by chance and in haste. I honestly hate war films, but I started watching and could not stop. The man who played the main character Stephen, is quite brilliant.  I felt like the story needed to show more of the relationship between Stephen and Isabel, however the war scenes fill that need for more tangible feeling, and there is an ok balance of the parallel story building.<br /><br />I recommend this to anyone whether interested in love and war or not.  It's beautifully filmed and directed. The score is fitting, and the settings rich. I cried at the end and thought about the tragedy that war is. It left me feeling quite bereft. And just wanting to hug Stephen and try to restore even a bit of what he lost along the way of the war.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read. It is awesome. It is sad. And breathtaking. I read it in 3 days. I couldnt put it down. I would definalty recommend this book to anyone.
B001RQ0SJO|4.0|This is a talented artist. The composition and the sound for each song is quite unique. Few songs were quite on the slow side, however I still I enjoyed the album. For those who like Bjork may enjoy Bat for Lashes.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|This movie has excellent jump factor. It was not so much HORRIFYING as it was freakish and creepy? Why is the littlest girl prone to running on all fours?  Why does she hide in boxes?  Why not open the closet door? Who, what is MAMA?<br /><br />If you liked The Ring and The Grudge, you will like this. In all fairness, this movie takes the genre up several notches because the outdoor shots are gorgeous. The indoor shots can sometimes be too dark, and it gives one (me at least) a slight feeling of being cheated. But then the darkness is part of the story.<br /><br />If you are on anti-depressants, eat a fistful before watching. I admit there were three points at which I was moved to tears. I won't spoil it for those about to watch. You will know the points when they occur. If you have kids, you will recognize the tearjerker scenes all too well.<br /><br />Even now, thinking about those scenes really makes me uncomfortable.<br /><br />For overall emotional impact, this really is a five-star effort. The 1s and 2s are most likely from folks who think REAL HORROR is Halloween or Friday the 13th. The psychological fear and apprehension generated by many of the scenes in this movie far outweigh the gruesome scenes of teens being impaled on various farming implements --without the gruesomeness. It is free of any gore, although, again, some scenes can be disturbing.<br /><br />I strongly recommend that you grab a cold drink and some hot buttered popcorn, turn off all the lights ---and enjoy!
B0045HCJRG|1.0|this was not wrapped by the manufacturer.  The inside booklet was missing.  Very disappointed this was sold as a new dvd.
B003Y5H54W|5.0|so far so good nothing bad a Amanda Seyfried she is great don't know who yhe warewolf is but i have a couple possabilities on that but so far no scratches and the movie showed up when it was suppose to
B00BJA2VFW|1.0|If you have played the Cradle of Rome and similar games, this one is even slower and clunkier in its graphics, especially when compared to smooth and elegant 3-match Kindle app games such as Bejewled 2  or Fishdom or Call of Atlantis.<br /> I got this game with my first Amazon coins based on good reviews.  I found the 3-match difficult to comprehend, making moves awkward and costing me powerups.  To me the purpose of the game was uninteresting.<br />Apparently  although I &#34;purchased&#34; this game with the coins, I have no return-for-refund option. Not a happy experience all around.
B00BEZTMFY|1.0|waited so long to recieve this movie from the states, had to pay £12.48 postage to get it, now its the wrong region so it wont play on my x box, have to pay to send it back, will go to HMV only £10 there and no hassle......thankyou...
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Get this game. Graphics A+. Everything is so awesome. This is probaly be my 2nd favorite game. I will play this game a lot
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|It is the best looking fps game on the tablet. The controls take a while to get used to but after that it is smooth sailing .
B000GCFX3Q|4.0|I dare say this was a little predictable at times, but I loved the story anyway.  The main character is definitely someone you want to root for and the book is quite humerous.  I would recommend this book and would definitely consider reading another Keyes book.<br /><br />I recommend:  [[ASIN:B00AVQ3HBW Letters To Young Chong]]
B0091REZMW|2.0|I love the graphics, the music, the different quests. However, since the game freezes and requires a hard reset every other time I play, not sure if its worth the trouble. I've uninstalled and reinstalled three times so far. Next uninstall will be the last.
B008ENA74E|4.0|I enjoyed the novel. Greg Smith did a solid job in providing insight into corporate culture at GS. The book was just as I had expected.
B00915G6YE|3.0|Seasons 1 through 5 of Dexter are exceptional television.  Season one we set the stage, kill the brother.  Season two is the Dokes resolution.  Then its Jimmy Smits, Trinity, and Lumen.  All amazing, all different, all focused on a killer v. killer plot line, dangerous for Dexter, growth in an outside of normal reality way.  Then we got season six, which was almost a total waste of time, now seven tries to recapture the old magic, but fails.  There are too many little plot lines, and the big plot line is Deb v. Deb.<br /><br />It has always been problematical for viewers to believe that Dexter could be so careful and so careless at the same time.  For example, he never has his apartment alarmed, yet he always keeps incriminating evidence there.  He grabs people in public places, etc.  This season is the worst in that regard, beginning with his carelessness is letting Deb see him.<br /><br />The interplay with the Ukranians should have been the central plot, but it is resolved too quickly and too easily.  I love Yvonne Strahovski, but I don't think she's used to her best here.  The whole can two killers date should have been more than just a tease for us, and she's too smart to go after Deb in a way she had to know Dexter would figure out.<br /><br />Season eight is going to be the end, and that's a good idea.  I think the creators ran out of great ideas when Lumen rode away, and we've spent two years frustrated by seeing what could have been, rather than what is.  The ending was terrible, made me wish they had followed the books and LaGuerta was already dead years ago.  If they can fix all of this for season eight, it will be the biggest escape of Dexter's career.
B000QJM8Z0|5.0|Ever felt that someone has based a character about you?  I did, when I read this book!  Clumsy, foot always in her mouth, saying inappropriate things at inappropriate times, can't stop drinking, can't lose weight.  You might as well called this my diary.  Fantastic read.<br /><br />I recommend: [[ASIN:B00AVQ3HBW Letters To Young Chong]]
B005NFVZTM|4.0|We enjoyed the movie but I felt like I was missing the actors from the orignal movies. I know they need younger stars but still...
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|I just enjoyed this film. If your into fantasy films like I am you'll enjoy it too. I'm not going to tell you what it's about, seems everyone who's reviewed this film has already spoiled it. Just buy it.
B00B5QGPZC|5.0|This DVD started out with a great intro and just got better. Though he speaks in German throughout the performance, the English subtitles were helpful, not intrusive. He was so excited and obviously enjoyed himself which was a great joy in itself. Favorites were: Sandstorm, Viva La Vida, Corelli Variations,  Cry Me a River, and ending with Let It Be was  very emotional. Actually every performance was great, unique and fun to watch over and over- this is a great DVD for your collection.

B0076HM3ZA|1.0|This is one of the most misogynistic, disturbed pieces of garbage I have seen - ever.  I like art films.  I like creative television, but the violence toward women, the obvious attitude that they are bodies and little more is so backward that any attempt this series made at far eastern spirituality is completely lost.  The women in this program spend their time doing what their cheating, abusive boyfriends/husbands tell them to do, engaging in prostitution, engaging in adultery, and all (but one) are essentially high school drop outs.  When they're not busy doing those things, they're getting murdered.  The series is bloody and violent.  This violence is mild in the earlier episodes, but by the time you get further into the series, it's stomach turning.  The portrayal of pure evil is given double the screen time as the portrayal of pure good.  Worse than daytime drama in the area of lying and infidelity.  Don't pollute your mind or waste your time.  Worth skipping.  Read a synopsis online if you feel the need to know the storyline so as to converse with your tasteless friends who like this.  Better yet, let them know you have better things to do.
B003VWU2WA|2.0|------------------------------<br />2 Feb 2014 **<br />------------------------------<br />I upgraded to Mac OX 10.9. I cannot get this device working. Byzantine controls. Other than Photoshop, nothing much else worked. Downgrading my opinion from ***** (five stars) to ** (two stars). Not thrilled.<br /><br />------------------------------<br />18 May 2013: ***** Mac Photoshop brush size a success; \\"Fort Knox\\" packaging (original opinion)<br />------------------------------<br />I can't get the friggin' thing out the friggin' box. Manufacturer boxed it up like Fort Knox. The device is wrapped in the kind of plastic that can cut arteries, which deters shoplifting, but also deters honest buyers.<br /><br />What I need this device to do is very specific. On Macintosh, in Photoshop CS5, while using Wacom Cintiq, I need the jog shuttle to increase and decrease brush size. If the device cannot do that -- which the [[ASIN:B0032Y0OH0 Contour ShuttleXpress 3D Input Device]] and [[ASIN:B006H2RP12 3Dconnexion 3DX-700040 SpaceMouse Pro 3D Mouse]] can NOT do -- it is useless to me.<br /><br />This device DOES indeed lets me change brush size -- hallelujah!<br /><br />And it was easy. Using the pdf instruction manual from the Griffin website, I had it up and running in 10 minutes. EASY, EASY, EASY. In contrast, I spent several hours (each) with the ShuttleXpress and SpaceMouse, and still could not get them to do (not-even-close) what I needed.<br /><br />I generally like Griffin products. The Powermate I recommend: five stars (*****). But the PowerMate doesn't have the extras I need. I need more than a twirly thingamabob; I need BUTTONS as well. Hence, I keep looking...<br /><br />[To manufacturers' of ShuttleXpress (yuck) and SpaceMouse (yuck): Why can't THEIR devices change Photoshop's brush size?]<br /><br />------------------------------<br />28 May 2013<br />------------------------------<br />After spending all day yesterday (Memorial Day) tooling around Amazon and the Internet, I accidentally came across a company called Bella-USA.

B008602KQI|1.0|I was interested to see this movie, brought to me by the lovely partnering of Amazon and Roku, but what a disappointment!  I couldn't tell if it was deliberately comedic, or just such an overwrought, silly story line that it was aimed at a much younger age group (tweens?).  The plot revolves around \\"tributes\\" (children aged 12-18) who are brought to the Utopian/Dystopian capital of a nation, to fight to the death, for the entertainment of the watching masses (think Survivor, but much less forgiving).  Now, aside from the utterly absurd idea that anyone would EVER do this, or would WATCH it, this plot has gigantic holes that you could drive a Hummer through.<br /><br />The main character does things like make a fire and feed a smaller girl (one of her competitors to be \\"the one\\" to live), despite knowing full well that other contestants have been tracked and killed by lighting fires.  When another contestant is killed, the heroine takes the time to lay her out, collect FLOWERS and decorate her poor corpse with them, despite the fact that she's still being hunted by a pack of competitors.  (Uh...really?).  She's supposed to be in what any professional pilot would call a \\"mission-critical\\" environment--every action has potential consequences, but she behaves like she IS on Survivor, and some host will be along any second to fix the situation.<br /><br />There's some very callous and questionable actions--is she genuinely interested in her \\"co-star\\" from her District, or simply using him for the benefit of the all-present cameras?--and as I said, not even in a jaded world can I conceive of anyone thinking a television show where child contestants beat each other's brains out is a viable prospect.  The movie just stops--doesn't \\"end,\\" and it's abundantly clear that there's other movies to come, to finish the (lame) storyline, which, OF COURSE, will have some monumental revolution started because of some action by this GIRL, who quite honestly, pretty much didn't deserveto survive.<br /><br />I found it impossible to suspend disbelief; not even the mighty Stanley Tucci, whom I adore, could save this piece of dreck.  Woody Harrelson is actually the best actor in the piece (saying a lot), and delivered on his role, although it didn't seem to be much of a stretch.  Donald Sutherland seems to be phoning it in, playing the ubiquitous \\"evil leader.\\"  The stormtroopers are dressed like, well, stormtroopers. Everything is so cliched, so predictable, so hackneyed...won't be looking for either the sequel movies, nor will I be reading the books.  Truly glad that I didn't pay to watch this!!

B00AZMFK3K|4.0|Into Darkness is better than the last cartoony yet enjoyable relaunch from 2009, but it seems to be trying to hard to feel like a Star Trek film. It doesn't help that the story this time around is far from original. Still, it is a lot of fun with great CGI, good acting and a nice dose of humor. Benedict Cumberbatch makes for a strong villain due to his still gaze and deep voice, though he fails to measure up to the charisma that Ricard Montalban brought to the role of Khan.<br /><br />I would still take The Wrath of Khan, The Undiscovered Country or First Contact any day over these last two entries, but they do have a wide appeal and in my opinion are more enjoyable than the last two Iron Man movies.<br /><br />After watching Into Darkness it's no wonder that J.J. Abrams is taking over the other epic Sci-Fi saga, which is his true love anyways. It really shows.<br /><br />IMAX 3-D looked great and was worth the extra $5.00.

B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|My error in not noticing the \\"R\\" rating, but from the preview I would not have guessed that the movie would be so vulgar with the \\"F\\" word in almost every other scene.  And this all within the 1st half hour.  But that's not the worst of it.  Very early in the movie there was a scene with 2 homosexuals in bed together... this turned my stomach and together with the profanities, I knew I wouldn't finish watching the movie.  I hate seeing an actor of the caliber of Tom Hanks in a movie such as this. Again, my fault for not noticing the R rating. Thank goodness for Amazon Prime movies, I can watch the great movies of my youth and not hear 1 profanity.

B008ROZAQU|4.0|My all time favorite.  Love the music, and seeing the Duke. The entire family love watching this movie over and over.
B008JLEUD0|5.0|I saw her perform in El Paso, Texas at Tricky Falls and I was blown away by her performance.  I wish I would have bought the CD before watching her live because then I would have enjoyed her music even more.  Anyway, I bought her CD after the fact and I've listened to the album about 30 times now and it doesn't get old.  The fact I don't understand the lyrics doesn't matter.  It's alll about the melody or beats that make this a must own CD.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love playing this game through Facebook, so I added it to my Kindle and android phone. This is fun and fully functional. The special effects, bonuses and various screens appear just as it does on Facebook. The best part? not having to log in to anything to play.
B00B935SUY|5.0|This is one of the most entertaining documentaries I have ever seen. If you are a music lover, I highly recommend you watch this.
0760703329|5.0|I was scared stiff when I was told that this book was out of print, but thank God it came at last.<br />I used to have a copy that got lost during several movings. Glad for this.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />Foluso Allison
B00821PCJS|5.0|Although Amazon has this series's , it only has last season. Does not carry current season three.  You paid for a service but most of the time it's old stuff. I'm thinking of canceling
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I couldn't put this book Dow.  Captivating...couldn't figure it out for at least 3/4 of the book.<br />Wish I could erase it from my memory and read it again.

B00003CY0V|5.0|nobody told me that the movie was going to begin w/ a gigantic explosion, so it was a big surprise. i liked the character development over the length of the movie too!
014241722X|5.0|My wife and I love John Grisham books and have not find one we did not like.  This was a great book.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|fun game, great graphics, but unless you want to pay a lot of real money, be prepared to play a very long time to unlock armour

B001GUXJQA|5.0|Nothing but praise for Michael and the Harry Bosch series. One of my top three heroes doing what all cops should be
B00AW8UK0K|4.0|Will be starting this lifestyle challenge Monday! Will repost how things go. Feeling very positive I can do this now
B008HK3XYK|5.0|There are so many choices for covers.  I like this one because it's slim, has an elastic strap to hold it closed and when closed it puts kindle to sleep, when open it wakes it up.  I got the orange color because it was less expensive than any of the other colors.  My kindle doesn't seem to care what color it's wearing.  Good price.
B000002H97|5.0|my first copy of this album was on the elektra label i think. it was stolen or mis-placed. this copy was my substitute, and as far as i know, they are identical and more than satisfactory!
B008XKSW7M|5.0|I am so glad I took the chance and watched this movie! It was very funny at times and sad at others. I loved the story, the actors, and I thought it was a fantastic movie for people that have kids or are thinking about having kids.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|My new favorite show! So good it could be on AMC or FX. I'm a Red Dragon fan from way back. This treatment of the characters is a real thrill. Feels personal (as if the writers got inside my head).  :-)
B005I548B4|5.0|I liked \\"the best of me\\". Although the end is predictable, the story is rich in emotions, decisions that you want to make but you also know that they will break your heart. Also, this book is also about life and its unpredictable twists and turns.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game app rocks my kids both enjoy the big variety it has .perfect for keeping them busy woould reccomend to all my friends
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I lovew this movie, and it was great using the service to see it before going to see the sequel
0451232852|4.0|Whenever I start a book I always tyy to predict who will die and who will survive. That's the ultimate outcome of any story.<br /><br />I wondered about that during the first 100 or 200 pages of \\"Fall of Giants\\". Eventually I gave up on trying to figure out what would happen and I decided to just enjoy the ride.<br /><br />This is another ambitious work by Ken Follett. We are not in the middle age building cathedrals or fighting plagues anymore. Instead, we are witnessing the major events of the 20th century that shaped today's world. But somehow the fight for justice didn't change much since \\"The Pillars of the Earth\\". Those in power are so self-centered and stubborn that they drag millions to the mass grave.<br /><br />The characters of the 4 or 5 parallel stories intermingle with each other. Sometimes it was so forceful and inconceivable  (not to mention the inconsistencies) that looked like a cheap novel. They were always conventionally located in the major historic events. But I still had a great time. Why? Because this book is the best history class that I ever had. The events that lead to the First World War always puzzled me and this book clarified a lot. It also covered the relationship between the Soviet revolutionaries and Germany. From my own research, Follett gave a quite accurate picture of what happened.<br /><br />\\"Fall of Giants\\" is mostly about the obscure forces who drive history and the constant cycle (which seems to be nature's) of destruction and rebuilding.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Enjoyable game for any time frame. Used it waiting in the airport, on plane, watching TV, waiting for the misses when she is shopping.
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|I always have a loading problem with only this game every week when the tournament ends I can't load the game until I delete it from my device and download it threw cloud
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is one of the best puzzle games I've played in years! It has definitely left me wanting more. I highly recommend you get it! Thanks fireproof.<br />I can't wait for the next one to come out. Enjoy.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|Didnt remeber this being in theaters but wirh the great cast i figured it would be good and it was great!
B00A77II0U|5.0|This game is great, will capture your attention and keep you up late. I am a big fan of this style game and look forward to playing more games like it.
B00CFITJKW|3.0|Eh, this game is ok, it took me a while to figure out how to land the plane,but you'll get used to it. Its also a good time passer if you ever get bored.I wish that you could buy some missions. Other than that, eh,ok!
B000JJSPXQ|5.0|I did grew up on this music back in the 80s. I will refer it to anyone that likes this kind of music
B00AFOS6P2|5.0|A friend turned me on to Nick Cave recently, so I bought three albums, to include Abattoir Blues. If you have never heard Nick Cave, you need to preview it first...I have these albums right up there with my ColdPlay as favorite tunes to drive or work to.
B001TAFCBC|1.0|It was horrible. Could not follow it. Felt like their was no plot. Could of fell asleep.  Very surprised with the cast involved. Thumbs down!
B009PNQUXO|4.0|this apps are awesome and when i got any app i love it and my kindle have more applications they are great
B0002ZDVF4|3.0|The 2nd Bourne movie in the trilogy had, literally, 1 fight scene (with the &#34;last&#34; Treadstone agent in his home, using a knife against Jason Bourne). The only suspense was the Russian assassin (who was sent by who knows who) who stalks Jason Bourne from the beginning until the end of this movie. If you're looking for lots of action, this is not the movie to watch. Instead, watch The Bourne Ultimatum.
B004KX5KPI|4.0|Not my favorite Nick Cave, but some very good tunes in this remix / remastered work. If you only get one Nick Cave, recommend Abattoir Blues or Push the Sky Away. Enjoy!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|There is so much to learn in this series. It's exciting and a little frighteningly real. So many ups and downs. Good for the serious reader.
B0019LY5IM|4.0|Lost: The Complete Fifth Season takes us back and forth through time and confounds viewers/fans with alternate, possible realities and time-travel. The first several episodes of this season lack any depth and don't build up much of a story, but this season gets interesting in the middle and towards the end when all the time-travel scenes finally stop and the Oceanic survivors who are stuck in the 1970s detonate a bomb in The Swan station/Hatch. This season was not as great as seasons 1-3, but season 5 is definitely better than seasons 4 and 6.
B00418NVLW|5.0|A friend turned me on to Nick Cave recently, so I bought three albums, to include Abattoir Blues. If you have never heard Nick Cave, you need to preview it first...I have these albums right up there with my ColdPlay as favorite tunes to drive or work to.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|It was just like seeing it in theaters! I would definitely rent a movie from Amazon again in the future! =D
B004JMSIRC|5.0|Next to The Avengers, Batman Begins, Man of Steel, and X-Men: First Class, Iron Man is and probably will be the greatest superhero movie franchise in history. Watch and you'll know why.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|So far so good and it's free.  Simple play earn points more games open.  Don't forget to hit ? You figure out a certain game.  Pretty cool
B008FYZIVY|5.0|what can I say? simply wonderful..!!  I love having the whole DVD set of the first and second season. JUST.GREAT!
B000VWYJ8G|5.0|The final installment of the Bourne trilogy starts off with suspense and continues with lots of action until the end. This movie finally resolves Bourne's quest to find out about himself and ends with a question of what happens to Bourne when he escapes the CIA. Watch and be riveted!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book you should totally read it some time In the future you will never want to stop reading
B00CDT41RY|4.0|I thought it was a very good movie. I especially liked the part with the raiders complaining about the holes in their<br />sacks covering their heads. Funniest scene I have watched in a long time. A little bit of the gun play was too unreal.<br />No one was that good. Still good watching and well worth sitting through.
B00632HWOG|5.0|This is a great email service. I love communicating with my family all over. I use it everyday and enjoy it.
B00355L2TU|5.0|I'm not a fan of Jillian Michaels but she's fine in this video. This was exactly what I needed to kick start my work out again. It's a challenge and definitely worth the twenty minutes.
B00CATSONE|4.0|The voice for this book is notably casual, but with it, comes moments of colloquial wit.  It provides a concise overview of Tesla's life and work, and for that, I am grateful.
B006MR2ZQC|5.0|Our son loves Legos' period. This helps him be more creative and also problem solve. Very fun toy to build imaginations with and just sit back and enjoy watching what your children can build! Not to mention, what child does'nt love Batman and Joker?!
0920668372|5.0|I remember this book when I was a child and recently came across it searching for other childhood books so it was a MUST HAVE for me when I seen it. I think I have more apreciation for it now as I cannot get through the all book withoout crying everytime I try and read it. I have to have my hubby read it to me and baby and I still end up in tears, lol but I really enjoy this book.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|The storytelling is gripping and very much challenges the reader to think deeper through the power of the protagonist to change habits and how consumers are targeted in marketing campaigns.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game I have ever had.I play it almost every day because it is so addictive. I love t his game. You c a n never get enough of this game. It's awesome!!!!!!
0399226907|4.0|When I recieved this book in the mail I was a bit disappointed on how small it was, I was expecting it to be bigger, upon arrival all I could think was \\"thats it\\" really small but none the less I still love this book and cannot wait to read it to my son throughout the years when he finally arrives because I know he will enjoy it as much as I did when I was a child.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|well I personally love the game but it is hard to get all the characters the ones you need cost too much and the ˝ gem sale˝ not, I bought the 260 gems on sale for $9.99 and was charged $ 19.99 instead still trying to get a credit or refund wish me luck hope they fix this for me.<br />Other than that it's an awesome game but the prices are kinda high we aren't made of money can u lower the prices that would make the game more appealing.
B000SEH1R8|4.0|I enjoy irony and Vonnegut delivers. He has funny visuals and what a great poem! He plays on our customs as Americans and questions our choices through Kilgore Trout.
B00B2166BS|5.0|My nexus 10 charges faster and the charger is more reliable.  I would recommend everyone with a nexus 10 to buy this!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The acting is phenomenal! Writing is superlative. Story is provocative. Great acting, writing is top notch. Storylines are extremely compelling. Beautiful scenery, costumes are fabulous, wonderful characters, superb actors.<br /><br />Downton Abbey grabs your attention and never lets go. I've seen every Season repeatedly. My intention was to just do a quick check of the DVD but ending up watching it again. Made me realize how much I miss seeing it weekly. The characters have me so captivated I don't want it to end. Even the ones you love to hate. The family, the downstairs staff, guests, and relatives are thrilling! Can't wait for Season 4. In spite of Season 3's conclusion being especially heartbreaking and difficult to accept.<br /><br />There is so much happening on this estate. Both upstairs and down. There is romance, cover-ups, villainy, manipulation, politics and everything imaginable. Never a dull moment, thoroughly entertaining.<br /><br />Some reviewers stated there were scenes missing. To reiterate I've viewed Season 3 at least half a dozen times and noted nothing omitted.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love it! It gives me the finest weather! I rate it 4 stars! Defiantly not $@&amp;+?#! Get it now! It is FREE!
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|We have watched this one at least a dozen times.  The kids never seem to get tired of it and the adults like it too.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I found it difficult to put down, the book is written so well I felt as though I were on Mars with him!
B000SEHJGQ|2.0|I'm a Charles Bukowski fan but this is difficult to read. It looks like it was hurriedly scanned and put on line. If you increase the font size it doesn't adjust, instead cutting off text that doesn't. It was not worth the bargain price.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is very well wrote with a great twist at the end. I like how the author switches the characters point of view with every chapter. Although this book is great, only mature adults should read it.
B0061PEAUY|2.0|The plot is thin at first and relies on the medical mumbo jumbo as a hook to keep the reader interested.  It reads like a BonesTV script without the resident humor.  The plot becomes more transpa
B009NY43NY|3.0|These books started out as great, fun reads. I kind of felt like this was a very anticlimactic ending; the last several books have felt sort of forced. Everything ties up a little too neatly with a big bow on top! But, it was a fun, easy read. Looking forward to a new series, perhaps?
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I highly suggest this game. Fills my down time and its really fun. I did have to pay 3$ to buy the full version but no other requests for money. And I have played for hours!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I chose this rating because it was a good read and the emotions of the characters were.such that most people can itdentify with..
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Good game, stays entertaining, still has a few computer kinks to work out, but it's improving with each update. Also has good jokes.
B0053R1T1O|5.0|A wonderful, if somewhat condensed, re-telling of T.H. White's novel, The Once and Future King.  If you have not experienced this film, you are missing something extraordinary.
B008602KQI|4.0|Great storyline! The actors and writers are very talented.  This movie was a heartbreaker which brought tears to my eyes.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I've just begun playing My Horse but I can already tell I'll be using lots of time to play it. very fun and somewhat addictive would definitely recommend.
B0043JDUNS|4.0|What do you want me to say, just watch the movie. Great addition to the mavel line up. A lot of fun.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Pretty much does what. you would expect a calculator to do.  Easy to read and easy to touch large keys.  Nice job.
B005IEGUDY|5.0|I totally loved this book.  I am a bit of an Anglophile and this book totally fascinated me as it wound its way through the history of Sarum.  I kept looking up  places on maps and encyclopedias as I read.  What a ride!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|FACEBOOK IS A NICE WAY TO COMMUNICATE WITH FRIENDS. HOWEVER IT SEEMS LIKE IT COULD BE A BIT INTRUSIVE IF YOU LET IT GET OUT OF HAND.KEEP CONTROL AND LIMIT YOUR FRIENDS TO A SELECT FEW TO KEEP FROM BEING BOMBARDED WITH EVERYONE ELSE'S LIFE, UNLESS YOU LIKE THAT SORT OF THING.
B00BR0SGN0|5.0|I was expecting a pretty good album. I WASN'T EXPECTING THIS! Don Airey's keys are brilliant, Steve's guitar is as awesome as usual and Ian's voice is very smooth and unstrained. The song writing is great. Purple purists may not like this, but I think this album maybe one of the their best ever. You can tell they worked hard on this album. We are all very fortunate that they are still around making great music.
B006VFLIYK|1.0|I've read so many books in my life, sadly I can't remember details on each at will. But I do have dim memories of books, and more importantly, authors, that I depend on. At one point any book by David Baldacci was an automatic must-read, but not so anymore.<br /><br />Specifically, this book is cheap. The characters colorless, the dialogue almost unreadable, and the plot just plan insipid.<br />And Baldacci, like so many other writers, has this morally bankrupt idea that a 40+ year old man could have a romantic relations with a twenty something girl...even if I was for the idea, it's just so stupidly predictable and mundane.<br /><br />Not that he cares, but I actually grew to resent the fact that I started reading this book...mostly because no matter what I don't quit reading books I've started. So, it was with a great sigh that I finished this book ... because it sucked so bad.<br />Don't do it.
B0064MGU98|5.0|recommended by several of my friends, i have enjoyed every minute of it well done entertaining and well worth watching
B0026KX5PO|4.0|Good movie to catch up on. Good actor, acting and plot. Somewhat unbelievable, but overall really good movie to watch
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I did not enjoy this book as it is surrounding what seems to be a mentally ill person not grasping the reality around him.  I had a hard time feeling sympathetic, and was hoping at the end his life would all fall into place...which it didnt.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I am a 5th grade teacher and read this to see if I should teach this to my class. absolutely! it's a wonderful story full of lessons about friendship acceptance and courage! I highly recommend this book!!
B006VFLIYK|4.0|The plot of this book thickens almost to the very end - as people are dying, they are trying to figure out the motive with 2 possible key targets.  This is my second David Baldacci book and I really enjoy the way to crafts the story to keep the reader engaged throughout the investigation.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Good job on an easy to use app for my Kindle Fire HD.  It is useful and easy to read.
B002ZG981E|1.0|I open up the case, and the latches inside that allow the multiple disks to pivot were completley shattered. My box for the dvds is essentially useless now.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|I like Twitter because it allows me to keep up to date with news and stories I want.  Easy to use on my Kindle Fire HD.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Wouldnt suggest it to others find it absurd that I pay to be elite but have to be on my laptop to play and cant play on my android. Gonna cancel my elite account
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|I originally expected this to be a much more action packed movie. I figured the movie was going to be much more like a &#34;Black Hawk Down&#34; telling of the events that lead to the demise of Bin Laden. I was wrong. Delightfully wrong.<br /><br />Instead the story follows the events through the importance of the lead heroine. Without any spoilers though, they handle the material very well. From putting the viewer into a mindset through the opening &#34;scene,&#34; the use of torture, the politics, and the humanity, it is captivating and engaging.<br /><br />It's not to say this movie isn't without flaws. Some scenes are obvious and a few times I knew what was coming long before it got there. All that said, sometimes it's about the journey.<br />Well, the journey and the last 30 minutes. I most definitely got my &#34;Black Hawk Down&#34; feeling at the end.<br /><br />Overall, it's a great movie and I am glad to own it. Touching, thrilling, intense, and brave, this movie is worth watching for these reasons alone. I will say this in closing: Pay attention to the minute details of the characters. The nuances of the characters and their stories, some unspoken, really elevated this movie above others. -Adam
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I love it one of my favorite game but I like minecraft better mine craft is my favorite game . it is around my favourite game
B005LAII80|2.0|I had several friends who said they loved this movie. They said it had action. Style. Gadgetry. Yep. As much as a six year old with crayons.<br /><br />This movie is honestly abysmal. While I will admit if you are the type of person who is impressed with flashy colors, testosterone plots, cyberpunk futures, and gimmicks, it's perfection.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I like Karl Urban. I enjoyed the cheese he played in Doom. He was a fantastic Bones. And, believe it or not, he's a great Dredd. He is not what is wrong with this movie.<br /><br />The standard movie features ridiculous slo-mo scenes lasting 3 times longer than they need to be, round about plot using psychics, the terrible execution of the &#34;at noon&#34; style movie making, this movie is just poorly shot. In fact, this movie feels like an exceptionally long modern made 90's music video. As for the 3D, it's not well implemented but does offer that type of 3D that feels like cards set at different distances. I've found some people enjoy this. I do not.<br /><br />I won't go on about this movie. I didn't like it. It isn't the worst movie I've ever seen but I would absolutely not recommend it to persons with my taste in movies. Like I said, it's possible you could enjoy it. Just know that if you think while you watch movies you're not likely to enjoy it. If you just sit back and take a ride when a movie plays, well there ARE worse movies... I just cannot immediately think of them.<br /><br />My friends who recommended this? Well let's just say this movie pops up in dialog more often than it deserves when they say &#34;you should watch BLANK.&#34; &#34;Remember Dredd? I do. Until I am cleansed... consider yourself Judged.&#34; Yeah... if the pun annoyed you... skip the movie. -Adam
B008N1V11U|5.0|really good game I love It I wish you made more games like that for every one okay do you get my point
B000P6YNSE|5.0|This is season 3. I bought all the seasons. If you haven't watch LOST before, you will really enjoy it. I plan to enjoy it again next winter.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I found the beginning a trifle slow and by part two I could not put it down.  I am so looking forward to the final book of the trilogy
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|It is a oh-well-i-have-nothing-else-to-do kind of app. It will make time go faster, however. It is mostly for little kids. 9 yrs and under only. I don't know what people are talking about, I downloaded it on a kindle ufire hd 7&quot; and it works perfectly fine. Here's a tip. Go to options ( or settings, whatever it's called ) and change steering to tilt. It works way better. I would only download this if you have family under nine yrs old
1250007208|5.0|This was such a great book because it kept me intrigued the whole time- I never put it down! And it has all the problems Cinderella faced in the classic, like a prince and an evil stepmother. But it also has a plague, Luna and their manipulative Queen, cyborgs and androids. It was definately worth reading, and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys Cinderella and cyborgs!
0786891416|5.0|A good beginning to a host of books, this book brings the television script stories to light as we would believe that &#34;Richard Castle&#34; is writing the story.  I look forward to reading and owning all the Richard Castle Nikki Heat novels.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I enjoy the bible. I actually sit and take the time to read along with it.<br />I love the reminder to read it also.
B004X8W4A4|5.0|This is one of the most fun books.  I feel as though I am reading the writings of the &#34;fictional character Richard Castle&#34; as he pursues his next hero and &#34;Kate Beckett&#34;.  A great and exciting novel!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Wish people would not continue to read a series they hate. If you like the series ignore the critics and enjoy fitting conclusion.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It  it good…<br />BOOK.It is  funny.Fun to reed. Long  and spread  ,spread to lot of  fan's. Sounds  good .<br /><br />From  Evanston  Conner
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Great acting. Great story. There is very little that Spielberg does for which I'm disappointed. Lincoln is no different. I will be owning this movie; to put with the rest of my Spielberg collection (ie. the color purple, saving private Ryan, etc.) :)
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Fun and Creepy and easy enough to be fun. Difficult enough to be challenging.<br /><br />I highly recommend this game to anyone.

B0091WL8TA|5.0|I saw Elvis perform live on June 25, 1977, two months before he died, and this video brought it all back.  The King lives on and on.
B0063GORYU|4.0|it is all right will use in waiting area at doctors office to beat the waiting for appointment to be over
B001ANSSDC|5.0|A look at life with the layers pulled back to reveal it's complexities which the author manages to present simply.<br />The search for happiness themes through all the character's  lives and how they deal with life when the circumstances challenge the quest.  Circumstances such as death, infidelity and emotional unavailability are defeated by commitments to good choices leading to health, healing and happiness.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Love this creatively interactive game. It really was worth the time and money. It's 3 dimensional aspect really brings the game to life and it really challenges you to think without ending up frustrated. I would recommend this game to any one who is looking for a brain challenges and yet doesn't want to play all those nonsense games that just focuses on memorizing and matching of those speed type tests. And I love that there seems to be a story line of sorts making it seem all the more interesting.
0307346609|5.0|the number one reason i read this is that i read online that it was written by the son of Anne Bancroft and Mel Brooks. curiousity overcame me as to what talent the son could have received from these two huge talents.  i would like to say puny but i would be lying.  i was enthralled by this book and mainly because i have always been a huge fan of wwii fiction. this too is a world war book and handles its subject matter exactly as if the third world war is against zombies. i kept telling myself the whole thing was preposterous but the author does such a good job of relating an oral history from everyone who fought it and survived it that i couldn't put it down. the tactics the allies had to develop against Z were absolutely ingenious.  i loved the canine corp used with the soldiers. i loved the scenes where they had to deal with zombies in the oceans, lakes and rivers plus in the snow.  they actually clung to the lid of a nuclear submarine as it surfaced!  if like me you love historical war fiction, you will love this book.  i am now dying to see how they filmed it.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B00A81MV3U|2.0|After everyone kept telling me I should see this, I finally buckled.  One of the worse movies I've seen in a while.  It kind of reminds me of the bad movies of the 1980's that end with the star accomplishing some feat such as boxing, skating, karate, or baseball. The only difference was that they threw in mental illness into the mix in this one.  They even threw in the token black friend who has no life, but depends on others for his happiness. Totally silly and a waste of time.  The acting was horrible except for DeNiro.  I would have rated 1 star if not for him.
B001NLKS16|5.0|I learned a lot but yes,some of the details are off. Still I could hear John in my head, so it's pretty good. Wonder if Sam and Dean keep journals.
B005IQ39AY|1.0|The ball didn't go where I tried to make it go.  Another &#34;Bubble&#34; game I won't play again.  Too bad.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|I have read a lot of the more well known Law of Attraction books and even taken a few courses taught by well known gurus that I prefer not to mention here.  All of them were good.  I will not say this book is better however, it is pretty darned valuable.  It touches on something most of the other courses never do \\"faith\\".  All of the other courses claim to reveal the one element that causes failure in manifestation and they all claim it is positive emotions.  I agree.  That is clearly necessary.  There needs to be the happy feeling that manifestation has already occurred before it has.  But this book actually touches on something that most religions have always known about receiving answers to prayers which is essentially manifestation by another name.  Call it the \\"other\\" missing ingredient - \\"faith\\".  You really need to believe it is going to work.  That sort of faith usually comes on the heels of several successful manifestations.  But if you fail to manifest several times you begin to have faith that it will not work and in does not.  This book helps you find the faith that it WILL work by including the 9 experiments.  These experiments are easy and require no tools and very little time.  The idea is to create small manifestations that are easy and quick so that you will have faith that larger manifestations that might take a bit longer will succeed.  Some people like to read a book all the way through.  I suggest you do not.  Read the book all the way up to the first experiment.  The stop and do the experiment.  When it succeeds (and it will).  Then record the success and move on to the next experiment.  Some people do the experiments out of order.  Again, I suggest you do not.  Do them in order.  Let the success of all the previous experiments build upon your faith and positive feelings about the next and the next thereafter.  I do not know if that is the way the author intended - but I suggest it.  When all 9 experiments have succeeded - I believe you will have the faith to KNOW you can manifest bigger and better things for yourself.
B000FC10MU|1.0|I tried to like this book, but I could not get on board with the author's style of story telling.  Not a lot of details, not much character development, not an intriguing storyline.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Voyager is the third book in the Outlander series. I loved it! Now I started re-reading the series in my Kindle. I loved reading it and listening to the audiobook at the same time.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|Seen mostly as the arch enemy of the faith, almost any faith, its easy for \\"believers\\" to write him off as \\"of the devil.\\" Well, this book does show he is a devilishly good author. It must be sad for those who would love to dismiss him, that he may know \\"faith,\\" at least some of them, better than many believers ... making his critiques and concerns difficult to ignore. That religion isn't his speciality should make this even more galling for the religious critics, where but a few may be his match. Accredited and esteemed by the same university as C. S. Lewis, one cannot easily be dismissed as a fool, without damming the other. Best of all, there is so much to be learned in this book's pages. It is a most worthwhile investment for anyone looking to expand their horizons. If you are the kind of person who can only appreciate or respect others holding the same opinions, this book may be a revelation for you, without the apocalypse. Yes, it may shake your faith to the core. But, if your faith is built on the foundation of only considerations of like affirmations, then it is most likely cracked or suspect already. It certainly could not be shared convincingly to those not already in the choir ... so this is a book you should take note of, because without discord there can be no harmony. As a bonus, Dawkins brings an engaging, illuminating introduction to science, forever removing it from the confines of  \\"The Brights\\" of intelligentsia and inviting all to share in its allure. I had two hard copy versions (the extra to share) before getting it on the Kindle. I go back to it often, enjoying the stamp of an author I will never meet, but highly recommend. (And yes, I also own \\"The Dawkins Delusion\\" by Mcgrath)
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|Didnt work on this kindle fire. Had it removed from my device. I have Talking Tom 2 on my I Phone. I use him to send people happy birthday greetings and happy anniversary greetings. People seem to love getting talking Tom emails. I have fun using this app. It is very temperamental however and seems to have a lot of bugs to work out yet. Maybe some Day when I upgrade my Kindle Fire I will get this app again for use on my new device. When ever someone sends me an email with Talking Tom message it always looks so much better on the kindle fire than on the I Phone.
B00B89WXYS|4.0|I like most of the songs, but I don't think it's as good as their second album.  Many of the song have a strong rhythm and are very catchy.
B009MYAQOA|4.0|A wonderful love story.  Also gives the reader a better understanding of Frank Lloyd Wright as a person.  Maymah, his lover, is a woman before her time.  We like and dislike her choices, which  was the cause of an interesting discussion at our book group.  I recommend this book as a good read.
1851522409|5.0|This is my second time reading, only with this volume the 3 novels are in one place and in order. Le Carre is a master story teller and even if you are not a writer and just love the feeling of being totally absorbed in the simple pleasure of the mystery, you will love the &#34;Karla Trilogy.&#34;
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. It was an excellent story with characters that all seem to be unlikeable.  It draws you in....
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Ug  this game gives you no help finding clues or where to go it driving me crazy about to give up
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This was purchased as a gift. The recipient loves it! Either you are a fan, or you are not. She definitely is! I had never even heard of the show and after I bought this off of her wish list I spent a week watching both seasons so I could begin season 3!
B0087IT8FK|5.0|I would not have shot the movie any differently. It fascinated me to find that the true life story involves an Algerian national and the aristocrat however I guess for political reasons this was not implemented in this movie. It's quite hilarious and a laugh out loud movie. I would be bilingual and to be frank, the English subtitles miss out on some of the French humor! Well worth watching though!
B008ELUEQC|5.0|It's Rod Stewart, there is nothing else needed to be said! Either you are a fan or you are not. I AM!  ;)
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This is a very good writer. I'm impressed with his use of language (the prologue swept me right in) and his storytelling. It's my go-to book when I want to rest for a while in another world.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|Has a couple of cliche moments and classic painting-like compositions, like at his death bed, but if you focus on the character study, this movie is excellent. In half of the movie, Lewis appears Lincoln tall, but that's alright because his portrayal is seemingly perfect.
B0038NN3B4|4.0|A good overview of the Atkins diet. Helpful information. I might recommend a hard copy book, however, if you really want to do the Atkins diet. That way, it's easier to move back and forth between carb counts and information on other pages.
B004G7UTXG|4.0|Very good movie about the frontier of the colonies in South America. Some beautiful shots. It explores principle to live by.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use it on my Kindle Fire,  android cell phone, home desktop,  and both work laptops.  I always have access to what I need when I need it on what ever device I have available.
0307346617|5.0|Reader be warned....this is a book of many stories. If you are expecting a nice conventional connected and easy to follow plot,  this is not it. WWZ reads like a collection of first person accounts. I loved it , but my son and wife struggled with piecing the stories together.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I like that this game feels more educational than others like it. The color and picture quality are great on the kindle HD, and the music is very soothing for my eight year old.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book. Only other King book is have read is The Green Mile. Gotta add this to your reading list
1609611543|5.0|Everything was satisfactory!  Items were EZ to open.<br />Always great to do business with! Would make a very nice gift to share with others.
B005MMYBXI|5.0|It is just like the other spatacus seasons. So if you liked the other ones you will love this one. It gives you a back story<br />to some of the best characters before spartacus arrives.
B003JTHESA|4.0|FINAL FRONTIER is another classic MAIDEN album since Bruce´s comeback on BRAVE NEW WORLD.....I really like BRAVE NEW WORLD, DANCE OF DEATH and MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH with lots of great MAIDEN gens like DIFFERENT WORLD, THE PILGRIM, NO MORE LIES or WILDEST DREAMS....FINAL FRONTIER is BY FAR the more progressive of all those albums.....Some songs are among MAIDEN´s best like MOTHER OF MERCY, STARBLIND and THE ALCHEMIST....but i gotta say the last 3 songs are waaaay too long.....
B007SGM084|5.0|I had heard about Fifty Shades of Grey, and when I found the trilogy, I purchased it.  Great price for a very interesting trilogy!
B00A8ECU24|4.0|decent game.  once you get several ponies it gets more fun to play.  my daughter likes the game esp. the minigames.
1616550414|5.0|I really enjoyed the book. And far exceeded my expectations. The cover is very nice and I recommend to all. I'm from Brazil and it here in Brazil is very rare.
0316187216|4.0|If you've read any of Abercrombie's books you'll know what to expect: dark humour, violence and action. As with his recent stand-alone novels, you don't need to have read his previous books to enjoy this one, but doing so will add some context and make the story richer.<br /><br />4/5 stars.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is a fun and challenging game!  Very addictive!  It works well on my Kindle Fire and I recommend it.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Very nice bag. I like how it has individual compartments for you stuff. Putting the camera at the top will add valuable<br />protection. The bag has the shoulder straps along with a waste strap which keeps the bag secure and from flopping around.<br />The 2 straps on the side for the tripod I was surprised by. Didn't think it a good idea. However, I stuck my tripod on there and<br />was really nice. The tripod stayed locked in place, wasn't a nuissance and my hands remained free. Would recommend. Very nice bag and very good price.
B009AMANBA|5.0|It's a part of Lincoln that wasn't shown in the other Lincoln movies that I've seen.  It covers much more of his political side.<br /><br />As usual, Sally Field did a wonderful job with her role.. I just love her talent!<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis did a wonderful job, too.  My favorite Lincoln movie is the one with Raymond Massey, and I'd have to say that Daniel Day Lewis' acting was equal to Massey's.<br /><br />The gist of the movie's acting talents: great job to all. :)
0765348276|5.0|I have read 2 of scalzi's books so far and l loved both of them. I have been struggling to find good new sci fi. He's innovative and delivers a more hopeful future then most current writers.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is good for fast paced games. I would recommend it.. not the best app but not the worst.. younger kids would love this app
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is amazing. I love that I can share my favorite things. There are so many great ideas from teacher appreciation to fashion.
B0095MVOMC|5.0|This game is a lot of fun!! I have several hidden number/alphabet games and this one is my favorite.  There are many levels for hours of fun
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Like all things the books are better, but this really was a great adaptation of the books.  I highly recommend it.
0756407125|4.0|There's a scene in which the protagonist, Kvothe, plays two songs on his lute. That scene could be a metaphor for Patrick Rothfuss' approach to writing, and perhaps his attitude toward his own audience.<br /><br />One of Kvothe's pieces is a tune everyone knows, played in a way that seems easy (Kvothe even yawns), but it isn't. Only the advanced musicians in the crowd truly appreciate the performance.<br /><br />The other song is more ornate and complicated, and Kvothe plays it in such a frenetic, over-embellished way that the know-nothings are blown away and applaud wildly...but it's actually far less impressive, from a technical standpoint, than the other performance. The real connoisseurs see through the scam and shake their heads in disgust.<br /><br />When Rothfuss/Kvothe periodically overindulges in long, complicated rambles with self-important flourishes, I feel that he is trying too hard to wow us with his showmanship, make his tale seem grander, showier, more epic, etc. This annoys me. I keep reading only because I know that he's also capable of the simpler (but more nuanced) kind of storytelling that seems easy, but isn't. Which is why I still give this book four stars, despite my keen disappointment that the writing isn't tighter and more evocative.<br /><br />In particular, less would have been more in the sex scenes. A few evocative details that allowed the reader to fill in the blanks with his or her own prurient imagination would have been far more effective, in my opinion, than the scenes as they are floridly presented by Kvothe/Rothfuss. Less-detailed sex scenes would also have allowed me to purchase copies of this book to send to my young nieces (who also happen to be my goddaughters)--avid readers of fantasy who enjoyed the first book very much...again, despite the verbosity interfering with the pacing at times.<br /><br />On the other hand, I love when the characters occasionally speak or think in rhymed, metered verse, which Rothfuss presents without lineation so that it seems like straightforward prose. As a formal poet myself, I know that that's very hard to do. But Rothfuss makes it seem so natural and effortless that most readers probably don't even notice it--I know that my husband and my daughter didn't. But the nearly-invisible structural restrictions improve the writing, I think, by requiring Rothfuss to reel himself in and weigh every word in those sections.thout lineation so that it seems like straightforward prose.

B00BHHIWQO|3.0|This game is alright as long as you have a Facebook. I liked that is was free, but it annoys me that I can only play this game for like 5 minutes and I have to wait for more lives. So if you have a Facebook I totally recommend this for you, but if you don't......it is just a waste of time. I hope this helps!
B0002B15XI|5.0|In every way, from directing, sound, writing, cameras, acting, MASH is a hard one to<br />beat for a comedy. Robert Altman's movie begins with the army hospital in sync. The<br />choppers bring the wounded into the hospital as the Johnny Mandel instrumental plays.<br />Like a lot of war movies, the film gets right into action. There is more extensive<br />movie credits in the beginning of the movie than you normally see. \\"Suicide Is Painless\\"<br />is instantly identified as the movie theme. Movie themes have a special place in my<br />heart, and sometimes directors don't use them. You get to see the same song performed<br />at the Hawkeye's version of \\"The Last Supper\\". I don't really know if Hawkeye<br />orchestrated all that. The hi-jinx all were probably a combined effort of Trapper,<br />Hawkeye, and Dr. Forrest. Anyhow, the whole memorial service thing had a reason. To<br />help a guy out with his \\"Manowar\\" stallion complex. What? Jawbreaker fail? In my opinion,<br />the Dental Don Juan didn't need any help.<br /><br />MASH is R. I have to wonder, who were they protecting? Good movie to see if you<br />sneaked some liquor into the theater, got drunk with friends, or the girlfriend,<br />the wife, but no kids under 21. At least in your opinion. You don't want your<br />descendants or your neighbor's kids there. That's the real reason you wanted to go<br />with a bunch of adults to see the movie about the 4077th. After 1956 videocassettes<br />went on sale. So you could go into the room where the set is and watch MASH again<br />with Junior. You could explain hypocrisy, or try, like why Major Burns is not a<br />\\"godless be-fool\\" but everyone else in the camp is. You could try to get pointers<br />yourself on how to pick up women the way Duke Forrest does. The surgeon lacks real<br />Southern charm with the female staff. But he knows how to do meatball surgery with<br />the best.<br /><br />In all, there are roughly six different stories or chronicles in the Mash film, and<br />you should watch the movie several times before you select your favorites. Despite<br />the fact the movie was about an army hospital during the Korean War, only one of<br />the little stories had an unhappy ending. Hawkeye could not pull the wool over<br />a Korean physician's eyes.<br /><br />.film, and<br />you should watch the movie several times before you select your favorites.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|The character development from the first book to the second book is excellent.  I especially like the psychological aspects which have developed between the first and second books of the trilogy.  One can really get lost in the fantasy of the relationships. It's hard to put the books down and disappointing to have them end.

1476734941|5.0|The idea is that by fasting we wake up our brains. My brain never had to work very hard concerning food. I was 30 pounds overweight for many years and I grazed all day long. Fortunately I never smoked and seldom drank alcohol just because I don't like the taste of it.<br /><br />By fasting twice a week for 8 weeks I have lost 10 pounds. I have just begun so I have no idea if I will lose more or stay with the program but the strange thing is I enjoy the fasts and I do think my brain has woke up. Since I am not constantly eating, my brain hopefully has started to make changes. &#34;Hey when is this clown going to get food again?&#34; &#34;Should I use up some of the fat cells I parked around his gall bladder?&#34; &#34;Hey, no one passed the salt should I look for salt in one of his arteries?&#34;<br /><br />At least that is what I hope is happening in my brain/body. The fasting is a surprisingly easy way to play with my fat. Hunger does come in 2 or 3 waves and lasts about 30 minutes per fast. Since we can eat 600 calories per fast I sometimes eat an egg or slice of thin chicken or ham during a hunger wave.

One wants to keep on reading, but work gets in the way.<br />I have read many of the author's books before and once again find this written work superb.<br />This book is very well written and the author once again shows she knows her subject, area brilliantly.<br />Linda
1401233791|4.0|I always loved this storyline but was too young to appreciate it when it was originally published. Now I was able to go back and enjoy it.<br /><br />The only thing that upset me was that it didn't show the first fight between Bane and Croc I would have liked to have seen it and it does set -up the fight in the sewer that takes place later.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|I really like this one. It's a good read that you can probably read in a few sittings (something i can't usually do cause I procrastinate reading books :D). It uses simple language and I learned a lot about Steve Jobs thanks to this book. It's really interesting to see how the history and childhood of one man changed the lives of so many people (mostly by iPhones and iPads, which are everywhere now, and of course the devices that followed them, most notably the Galaxy S series of phones).
B00BR0SGN0|5.0|I have been a fan of Deep Purple since 1970 thanks to some great older brothers that turned me onto them. I own all their studio albums and a bunch of their live stuff. My favorite album is Burn. I didn't think they'd ever top their Steve Morse debut Purpendicular. But with this album they have. I have to agree with the critics and say this is their best album since Perfect Strangers.And I've always wanted Bob Ezrin to produce these guys & I can say I was not dissapointed at all.
0307341550|4.0|I finished this book in less than 24 hours. Just like \\"Gone Girl,\\" I could not put it down. This is a gripping and suspenseful thriller that will draw you in from the very beginning. It also happens to be the most twisted mother/daughter story in the history of all time, which is another reason why I love it. For me, I figured out more of the story earlier on than I'd have preferred to with a mystery novel, but there was a big twist in the last few pages that I didn't see coming. Overall, this is an engrossing and entertaining read.
B00CL0J99K|4.0|So I think this film wasn't that bad, except for the whole drunk actor thing (spoilers) but I believe that maybe that person was acting as an actor to act as that person. Think about it. A possibility, I may be right, I may be wrong. I liked this one. Fits as a good ending to a trilogy. Whether they continue the series or not is unknown. It was good, but Marvel. Don't let Shane Black direct again, unless if my theory is correct, if so. Shane Black is a genius.

B0028DRGDQ|5.0|REC is the original Spanish movie that inspired ''Quarantine''.<br /><br />REC is definitely one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. The ending is truly horrifying. It is also a really short movie, running less than 80 minutes.<br /><br />The movie is filmed in ''Found Footage'' style. It is about a reporter named Angela who is doing a documentary with her cameraman Pablo about the daily routines of people who work in a fire station. Suddenly the firehouse receives a call to an apartment to help an old woman and Angela and Pablo go with them. When they get there, the old woman attacks a police officer, biting the skin off his neck. They then try to leave the building, but the police officers outside start to quarantine the building saying that there is an infection. The movie then becomes a zombie film where the characters are getting bitten one by one and turning into zombies. Near the end, we find out it is not really an infection. Angela finds a tape on the top floor, and the man on the tape talks about a girl who was possessed by an evil spirit. We find out that when you get bitten, you become possessed by this evil spirit. The man then mentions that he locked the girl in a room on the top floor, which is where Angela and Pablo are. They are then attacked by the possessed girl who is now horrifically emaciated. She screams loudly and swings a hammer at them.<br /><br />REC is a truly horrifying movie and is one of the best horror movies I've ever seen.

B0061PEAUY|3.0|Way too many characters!  It is very hard to keep track of who is related to who and how they relate to the story.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love playing thus game everyday and doing the daily reward to get prizes and coins. I also like going to different places around the world.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Ok, this is pretty awesome, I am a girl and I love this game!! For a kindle fire it is taken for best game ever-! Girls are playing  it too, don't just predict that only boys play it ;P
B0063IH60K|5.0|I feel anyone who likes Solitare will love this one.  The large cards are easy to see and easy to click on..
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Agree with last reviewer, fun, but takes awhile to build up. Have patience.  Most  games are timekillers, but very enjoyable.  Nice not to have to spend money.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Once Upon a Time Season 2 is very interesting! They introduce many new characters and this season take many surprising twists! I cant wait to see the 3rd season! The only things I wish would change is Belles new character &#34;Lacey&#34;, Captain Hooks obsession with &#34;skinning a crocodile&#34; and that the good guys would stay good. Oh and that Regina would not be SO annoying! But hey, it might change in season 3! THIS IS AN AWESOME PRODUCT!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris Kyle writes in an honest an open style.  He had given so much to his country and his team mates, it's a shame his life was cut short.  This is an easy read and good story telling.
B003K025QO|5.0|I have both the CD/5.1 DVD and the vinyl edition of this amazing record. I'm not going to review the music, because it's already been done quite a bit. The album is spectacular. It's timeless. Anyway....<br /><br />The vinyl packaging is beautiful. Cool record sleeves with lyrics/liners notes from Mikael. It also comes with a small booklet of the added artwork, which is okay. The art isn't too intricate, and it's all so darn dark (which is the theme of BLACKwater Park, I know). However, it's still pretty damn cool. The records themselves are very heavy-duty 180 gram beauties that play wonderfully. If you own a turntable, buy this. If you don't, buy a turntable, THEN buy this.<br /><br />The 5.1 mix is the only thing that can come close to the vinyl reissue in terms of sound quality. I like to turn the lows and highs up while keeping the mids relatively low with my soundcard on my computer. It really brings out Mikael's vocals. The vinyl isn't drastically better than the 5.1, but it slays the CD (obviously). I like owning both. The 5.1 is spectacular, and when I'm in the mood for vinyl and large, gorgeous artwork I'll give the LPs a spin. This is one of my favorite records of all-time, so I'm happy to own both.<br /><br />Both the 5.1 and vinyl are great. You won't go wrong either way. It all comes down to personal preference.
B00AEK9BKQ|4.0|Helen Hunt is at her best.  Both a moving and funny story - you will laugh out loud.  Fine acting from the entire cast.  William H. Macy is hilarious and John Hawkes is wonderfully sweet.
B003M6FGTE|4.0|Glee really had great potential for being a superb program because the casting for the different character roles was outstanding, the music was very good and many genres were represented. Also, there were moments of great choreography.<br /><br />The negative was Hollywood's obsession with immoral sexual situations; all the major characters were involved in some sexual escapade, whether literal or fantasized. Surely, good comedy can be written without having to involve all the major characters in that manner. Also, the political correctness was, at times, way over the top. All of these things diminished from what might have been a five star rating from me.<br /><br />If you like music and dancing, you will enjoy Glee as long as you can stomach the negatives I mentioned.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|son loves it.  He watches it almost every night.  Even adults will enjoy this movie.  I enjoy watching it with him.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Enjoyable entertainment. I really enjoy this game more using finger taps than a cursor and mouse. Nice stress reliever. Nice graphics,smooth and quick reaction.  It's kind of addicting.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I enjoyed the book.....Found it difficult to put down.  It was the first book I have read that didn't have anything similar to other books.  One that you could not guess the ending....
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|this show is sick when I watch it I feel like im at hollween horror nights. always keeps you guessing
B0058EBNAO|5.0|I had other weather apps install and I removed them from my cell phone after buying eWeather HD.<br />This is the only One you need.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|This book is a rather good read as military books go. It's written almost like it's for a movie but it works well as a book. I would definitely suggest this to anyone who wants a book that plays out like an old war movie. I was surprised it was so short, or rather I couldn't put it down so time went faster.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I like this app better than another mahjong game I have on my Kindle Fire. Good way to escape TV!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Fun to play jump to grab a rope you can go in the forest. or in a mine it takes a bit to get to the mine. you ride in a cart in the mine. And Thar's lots of turns. And Thar's a giant ape or some thing like that chasing you.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|First played this on an Ipad! Then found it for Kindle Fire. Easy on eyes & fun to &#34;connect&#34; the dots!
B003OUXECE|3.0|While this novel provides (somewhat) interesting backstory for the city of Rapture and the characters contained therein, it is obviously aimed at a slightly younger audience than perhaps the game itself was. Buy only if you are a die-hard fan.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love to play this game it is addictive. I would recamend this to everyone if Icould but this is the second best thing.
B00AEFY08O|5.0|What can I say? It's Forest Gump..... It's one of a kind and there will be no other movie like it. Simply brilliant.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Well written.  I would recommend this book to others.  I'm anxious to read other books by William Landay.  Great book for the beach.
0062059963|4.0|I read the Selection and found it fascinating so I ran out and grabbed this, the second book in the series. It was ok, clearly a transition book. America in this book is much too wishy-washy and her relationship with both of the boys is nowhere closer to being decided. You have to read this book I believe for the next one to make sense but I think The Selection is a better read.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great puzzle game. It is short though. Wished they would add more to it. Has great graphics and the puzzles are challenging.
B000WGWQG8|4.0|I really enjoy watching this - so far I've gone through it twice.  Its very well done, the acting is great.  I didn't expect to like Paul Giamatti so much in the role, but he really brings Adams to life.  The only complaint is that it has some unnecessary historical inaccuracies in it, mainly the timing of certain events (like his daughter's illness) and some of the storyline around his son-in-law, around his son Charles, and a few other things along those lines.  For example Mrs. Adams scolds Ben Franklin for his behavior in Paris, implying he is being untrue to Mrs. Franklin, but at that point in time, Ben Franklin was I believe a widower.  Not sure why some of these changes were made, because they really add nothing of value to the story.  Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.<br /><br />It really does give you a profound admiration and appreciation for what our founding fathers went through to create this country.  So in the end its highly recommended.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|A wealthy carefree man, a car accident, the unthinkable happens and he manages to see the bright side of life.  love this movie and book
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Love this show, I am not into Knights and armor type of shows but this is top of the line and keeps you on the edge of the seat not to mention the shock factors provided throughout the series.
B00CHIMG6Y|3.0|The news ruined it lol we knew what was going to happen....but most the special effects were not that great. I guess I knew the story line so I could leave the room and come back and not feel i missed anything..something was missing maybe getting to to connect to the people...
0061544493|5.0|I bought this book about 2 years ago and I still pick it up and flip through to refer back to. I love this book because first off its full of info! From the type of cut of jeans (1st chapter)to vacation packing, down to the best skin care products. Its also full of photos of the type of clothing, on someone, so you can really see the fit and understand what you should look for when your shopping, so you don't spend time trying to make clothes do something they weren't designed for. Its clearly written, a little U.K. slang is okay with me (going on Holiday, the high street, knickers)I l really like that the book reads as if shes talking talking to you, like it isn't super technical and even a usually plain dresser (me) can get it! Its entertaining to read and Victoria comes across as witty and funny and its nice to see that side of a celebrity that famous for being super serious. All in all, great read.
B00683JK9K|3.0|It is just okay. But I have another version of Magic Puzzles that I like a whole lot better. It was created in 2012. This puzzle was created in 2011.
076421120X|3.0|Darlene Zschech's new year-long devotional, \\"Revealing Jesus,\\" has many appealing, charming elements to it. I love that many of the devotionals come from a series of scriptures and are in order, reading like Darlene's own, personal daily devotionals as she reads the Bible. Darlene also includes a classic devotion at the end of each month not written by her. But her organization isn't the best, and not all the devotions line up with their month's topic. Truth is, I'm not much of a devotional person, as they never get deep into Scripture and most of the time involve feel-good messages. But most people will enjoy this new devotional book. It's made a good, encouraging read before bed each night, even if it doesn't stick with me.<br /><br />*Disclaimer: I received this book for free in exchange for my honest review of it.
B005LAIIKI|4.0|It has plenty of laughs and it is very dark in a funny way all the actors played there parts to the letter
B00003CWOL|5.0|this is really funny I love watching this movie. really glad that I buy this move for it is great and funny.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I love hidden object games and this is one of my favorites. I enjoy the &quot;missions&quot; and the fact that you have to do them in order to level up. Definitely a fun game.
B00BI6SSMC|5.0|I have been a fan of Sam Beam since  discovering his live performance of Flightless Bird on the first Twilight extended CD.  His  unique voice and lyrics make Ghost on Ghost album a joy.
B008JH5HCW|3.0|Guy Pearce rarely does truly bad work -- if he is in something, there has to be a spark somewhere.  And, as per my title, if Peter Stormare is there, so am I.  He is a very charismatic actor and I would watch him in anything.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|Read the book first and fell in love, watched the movie and wished I hadn't, it was completely different from the book and in a bad way.
B00CM96A60|5.0|I've listened to this over and over. It's a great album to work to our drive. Just keeps you going.
B008N1V11U|2.0|honestly I loved the &quot;price-drop&quot; but after a while... 2-D was more entertaining... I'm not saying its bad or it glitches, its just the graphics are HORRIBLE. I was looking at the game for months but $7 was insane then it was $3 I was tempted then 99&cent; I hit the fan I was jumping around the room then I was sooooooo diapointed... I monkey flinging his $#!+ is more entertaining.  please take my advice.
B007MU85D0|5.0|It is very refreshing to know that talent is still alive in today's music. This group from the ice is oozing with talent. A very enjoyable album.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Everyone should use this app. I love it. I can spy on my brothers using the microphone. But it works better for kindle fire hd. I recommend this app.
B005IEGUDY|5.0|I read this book when it came out in hard cover.  Ordered it for Kindle and read it again.  Between readings I have visited the area twice.  Our family tree is traced to Wiltshire giving this a personal connection.  If you have read James Michener's history based fiction and enjoyed them, you will enjoy this.  Stone Henge?  Salisbury Cathedral?  They are in there.  My next purchase will be &#34;Londinium&#34; by the same author.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|This is the coolest flashlight app I have seen! There are different styles within this one app. You can even create your own colored light! I highly recommend this app!
B0000667RO|5.0|He is one of my mom's favorite singers. I was getting this cd for her. Good price for it, nice value.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|I enjoy happy endings. I also like intrigue,very good in both departments.I like Julianne Hough,and Josh Duhumel.I also enjoy the sea.
B004GYY714|5.0|Listen locally,or choose a station crossed the country.  Find your favorite genre and listen strictly to the music you want.  Consistent service.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|i don't understanf why anyone would buy the dvd only version. this has three different formats, including dvd. on the media side of things, yet another great season of a great show
B00CH87HF4|4.0|its an awesome game was up to level 15 things just started getting good when all of a sudden it sad level 2 my heart stopped I turned it off to try and restart then the game load screen froze up at about 30% when the music starts.  had to delete I hope some how it saved my stats with my log in ..... trying it now ...
1401225756|4.0|there are some really graphic things that sensitive people really probably shouldn't read. the chapter that happens in the diner will disturb you.<br />that being said, if you like messed up, this is the book to read
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is awesome its like when ur mad or sad or happy just play fruit ninja it helps everyone
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Could be cooler however if you like farmville its likee that with better graphics. I could have seen some combat and small workers to run around for drinks to eat that would be great.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I'm having a hard time getting a friend from face book to play words with friends on my kindle. don't know  what to do about it!!
B007SYWFRM|1.0|This was a total waste, I was disappointed in the entire game, a waste of money and time-I do not recommend
B005G5PPGS|5.0|I'm not much of a sports fan, but this book taught me a lot about both business and baseball. Even better than the movie.
B002NF1ZI6|4.0|I have been disappointed that most of the buckets of Legos only include 1 door and 2 windows.  My son wanted lots of buildings in his \\"town\\" and we had the bricks, but not enough windows and doors.  This was a perfect find and he squealed with delight when we received it!  It was a great price and we used amazon rewards, which made the price even better.  With free shipping, Amazon has been our go-to place for Lego purchases!!  Our only disappointment with this set was the fact that it comes with extra door / window inserts so you can swap out the \\"style\\", but we would've preferred to just have more doors / windows!!
020530902X|5.0|This is the book I remember from high school english class many years ago. Some of the guidelines have always remained with me, and I went in search of the book. This is that classic book, and I enjoy just reading it for fun. Highly recommended.
B00742BVW8|5.0|I have watched this movie over and over. It is much better if you watch with subtitles. The landscapes of China are breathtaking and the use of color through out the movie is amazing.
B002IKLZZY|5.0|With this movie I completed a Hitchcock collection I purchased from Amazon some time ago. 'North by Northwest' is a classic and definitely worth watching.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Super fun. Sort of short, but that's pretty typical for these sorts of games. Looking forward to the sequel. Hope it is released soon.
B0084U0IEG|5.0|This is absolutely the best book I have read this year. Now I am going to look for more books by this author and read them all!
B00CA9Y6Q8|5.0|I love Laura Mvula's voice and her songs. A great album to add to my collection. Great for easy listening.
B000QCQ9O8|5.0|Ian McEwan writes a story that you can't put down and yet you don't want it to end.<br />His language is beautiful and the tale fells real.
0425264351|3.0|After seeing the highly enjoyable Jack Reacher film, of course I had to go read the books. Mr. Child's Killing Floor is a not bad, not great introduction to Jack Reacher. We meet Mr. Reacher on a bus trip through Georgia. Jack is an ex Army Military police officer who has decided to live off the grid and live life by his own rules. While passing through the town of Margrave, Jack is picked up on a trumped up murder charge of an undercover Federal Agent. What follows is Jack dealing with a town filled with corruption and intrigue all based around one of the town fathers up to some real shady business. What didn't really work was how could a Fed get killed, especially one with great expertise and not send up a red flag in D.C. and have every Fed available coming Margrave for the killers? Only Jack Reacher is suspicious? Also the plot twist towards the end in my opinion was kind of stupid. I can suspend belief but woooooooowwwwww..... That twist was asking a lot. All in all, not bad. It is an easy reading action-er/mystery and I figure Lee Child must have worked out his freshman writer kinks because it appears Jack Reacher books are wildly popular. I do plan on reading more of the series, at least up until One Shot.
B006M4F67A|4.0|This is a fun game to play that won't frustrate you with its difficulty.  You can challenge yourself by trying to lower your completion times or you can challenge someone else.  You can also choose more challenging puzzles.  I like the game.  It keeps my mind active while I am waiting in line for something.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|Sound wasn't regulated well. Had to max out volume on tele and still couldn't hear softly spoken words and then turn it down again during action sequences. I think I'll just buy the DVD.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I thought this was a great sequel to the first book. It creates more questions than it answers. I can't wait to learn more about their powers and their other sibling.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|OK, it is a fantasy, but a really good one.  Some take offs from Blazing Saddles and how things might have happened one day in the past.  Not really but a good story.  That Quentin - a genius no doubt and with a view that is great entertainment.  Makes me think of &#34;through a glass darkly&#34; or something like that.<br /><br />To see the evil slave traders and the overseers treated the way they deserved - great.  Don Johnson is surprisingly good in his spoof as &#34;Big Daddy&#34;.  Overall if Quentin's name is on it - buy it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|addicted! my 5 year . old found this and I'm so glad he did. having fun trying to buy all the characters!
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|Having no previous experience in a reader or I-pad, I find it difficult to learn to use.  Why don't these devices come with a simple user's manual?
0099302780|4.0|The idea that it is the shape of the continents that shapes the material progress of the various human races is simply revolutionary. It has such a liberating influence on the way in which we understand the history of mankind. I can thoroughly recommend Jarod Diamond's book to anyone interested in the &#34;big picture&#34; of human history.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|At first I wasn't sure I wanted to spend the money on the video set. I don't have cable so I never caught an episode and fifty dollars is a lot for me to spend on something I might not like, but everyone I've spoken to says it's good. My husband and I decided we would just purchase the first episode on Instant Video to see what all the hoopla was about. Let me say that now I'm reading the book and finally bought the video set, too. I'm hooked. This series is wonderful. And now I can see why everyone seems to love the character Tyrion, too.(You're just going to have to watch it.) It is a bit of a soap opera but, you don't really feel it while you watch. The bad guys make you want to slap them and the good make you want to root for them. Oh and don't expect for main characters to be coddled either.<br />The story or stories if you will, are written with an interesting literary style, each chapter is told from one character's point of view. Each one is a different character but, some are used again in subsequent chapters through out. This I find lets you see what is going on with surrounding characters without having to be in everyone's head all the time. That can get frustrating with a book or series this large.<br />Over all this is an addicting series.<br />Having this available on Instant Video made it easy and inexpensive to watch a small portion (we saw the first three episodes, we couldn't help it, we had to see what happened next) before we decided to get the set on DVD.<br />One word of caution to parents, this series does contain sex, nudity (I would label it soft porn) and violence.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Thought it was pretty good movie for &#34;date&#34; night.  Action to the very end of the show.  I'd watch it again. Recommended
006114665X|5.0|Excellent reading about history from a different perspective.  Explaining circumstances and complication leading to a world war are complex and this author explains it in this book as best as possible.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|The book was sooooo amazing it aol shocked me that... a m a z I n g book just by the cover it could tell I rtf was my kinda book
B00785P2QC|4.0|I must say this is one of my favorite games.  The only complaint I would have is that I was very dissatisfied with the games graphics...makes the game look old. The game is definitely loved but if the graphics were enhanced I would rate it 5 stars instead of 4 stars.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|just has good as the first two.  tommy lee jones once again does a bang up job.  miss the pugh thought!
B00C6B9XCW|5.0|I found this movie at Walmart yesterday 5/17/13. If you don't want to wait. Its say on amazon that it doesnt release till late june. Not sure if its just a mistake on walmarts part (or just a mistake at my local Walmart) but hey whatever. I also picked up The Big Lebowski and Hellboy II and it looks like they have all of them on the display. The steelbook is really cool looking and I'm gonna enjoy just looking at the case on my shelf.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|What an amazing adventure story! As a sailor I could easily imagine the trials of Pi in his struggle to survive against insurmountable odds.  The true events?  I'd go with Richard Parker!

B004OZOTSQ|5.0|Nice and easy way to work with the contents in your mobile device. Transfer all kind of files. 5 stars.
B009ME47H2|2.0|I tried to use this app in various situations on a kindle fire but was unable to hear anything on playback.
B007FIY3VW|5.0|This is a fantastic app that does a lot of things for such a very small price. At $1, it is comparable with doc to go ( which I have on my iPad), or quick office pro which sells for 14.99. The good thing about this app is that you can easily transfer your word, excel, ppt doc to your mobile device via your wifi connection, wirelessly! And it maintains all your format abeit on a small ascreen. Definitely 5 stars.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Wonderful, wonderful !  I hadn't watched until the first one of Season 3!  Had to go back and watch each one then from Seasons 1-2.  If you haven't watched it....start at the very first episode....you'll be hooked!!
B004BDOJJU|5.0|Haven't finished it yet, but it has been amazeballs so far. Neil Gaiman never fails to draw me into the otherworldly realms he creates.
B005LAIGLO|5.0|Great action movie ! One of Wahlberg's best ever ! Totally believable storyline. If you like action this is a must see !
B00003CXRM|5.0|My grandson's English teacher recommended this to him.  Because I loved the original release in the movies I was pleased to watch it with the family. Service was excellent as usual.
B0039Q7QKE|3.0|This came beautifully packaged, is real metal and looks fantastic.  But I only got to wear it twice before one of the clasps on the back pins somehow wouldn't clasp anymore.  I am saddened that I cannot wear this and only have it sitting around as a keepsake.  I am also, I am sure, too late to try and get an exchange as I have had chronic illness and spent little time online and also taking care of anything other than the bare necessities that needed taking care of.  I have no idea where to find those little round squeeze-clasps that go in back either.  Perhaps if I could locate one, I could wear this once more.
B002RKSZWG|5.0|Jane Austen at her best.  Get this book and read it.  The best part?  It's a free download! Worth the price (smile)!
B000YGEBZA|4.0|I thought this was the size of the vhs tape inside its huge it includes the script 8x10 glossies and two vhs tapes it was a great deal got it for next to nothing thru amazon wharehouse deals.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|I love this story, it is one of Dr. Seuss's best stories.  I like this movie a lot!  It still has a lot of the things that brings the childlike wonder in you a you watch it.

B003YOZNBU|4.0|I bought this movie because it was a nice movie for a great price.  If you are a fan of movies made from comics, this is the one for you!  Not everyone will like this movie, but it grows on you.
B004UIOUHC|3.0|It's okay, but I didn't care for it because I couldn't do my homework on it. It is an okay alternative to silk.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Read this for a work book club. It was ok. Parts of it that were about what happened to him medically were interesting, but did not enjoy his description of his experience -- felt too much like made-up fantasy.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Too many pop ups that don't allow you to play the game of bingo.  It's annoying and the cause of me not using this game app anymore.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I read the first book of the Century Trilogy and enjoyed it. In the second I missed the closeness to the characters from the first book, but this one was even more riveting than the first.
B004JN1CW4|4.0|Interesting finale that ended up with characters dead who from the start is thought would've survived.  The finale is not a happy ending per say but a reasonable, practical one
B002QB1910|2.0|I didn't realize that I was getting an edited version.  That's great, but some of the songs need the profanity, like G4L, the &#34;MF&#34; is much better than a bleep.
0099581876|4.0|\\"But this is a people robbed and plundered; All of them are snared in holes, And they are hidden in prison houses; They are for prey, and no one delivers; For plunder, and no one says, 'Restore!'\\" -- Isaiah 42:22 (NKJV)<br /><br />If you are like me, you've been reading translations of Harry Hole novels for some time. Those references to solving crime in Australia have probably both baffled and intrigued you. Well, you can find out what it was all about by reading The Bat, the first Harry Hole novel.<br /><br />If you haven't been reading the Harry Hole books, then you have a great many treats ahead of you. I think you'll like the series best if you read the books chronologically by beginning with The Bat. While it's certainly not the best book in the series, it's a solid foundation for understanding and more greatly appreciating the later books.<br /><br />Harry in Australia is like an aardvark at a black tie dinner: he doesn't really fit there. Nevertheless, he feels called to find a cruel killer who has stolen a young life in a most violent and degrading way. While he's supposed to be there just so show the Norwegian flag, Harry takes as active a role as he would have at home.<br /><br />He quickly figures out that there's something very strange going on, but it's a big puzzle. In fact, Jo Nesbo clearly wrote this book to be jointly appealing for its flawed hero, our Harry, and its unusual mystery. Of the two, Harry is more appealing to me than the mystery. Solving the murder feels a bit too contrived.<br /><br />While there are lots of references to sights and places in Australia, the book doesn't feel fully placed there. Don't pick up the book to see if it reminds you of all your good times in Sydney. It won't.<br /><br />Nevertheless, there's a charm to a novel where readers are treated as though they had a mind, such that the story jumps ahead in rapid ways to action sequences in ways that require filling in the blanks. I like to do that. If you don't, you won't like the book as much as I did.<br /><br />Some of the action sequences are quite interesting in their conceptions and descriptions. Good going, Jo!<br /><br />The book has some startlingly original characters in it in terms of their backgrounds and preferences. I found that these details gave the story an edge that I liked.<br /><br />There's a deep irony in the book that makes the book more appealing, as well. If you don't care for irony, you'll just think the book is too long.<br /><br />Well, it could have been edited down to good effect by about 15 to 20 percent. There are loose sections that don't advance much of anything.<br /><br />But don't miss it. Harry Hole is a piece of work, and you need to see this part!n't like the book as much as I did.<br /><br />Some of the action sequences are quite interesting in their conceptions and descriptions.

B00BSWMITK|5.0|I find this album to be great in musical composition and the performance of all the band members. Each instrument has been played very well and the overall sound is of much freedom in playing than most previous albums that rocked also.<br /><br />I like the way the music changes from one form to another. There are hints of several different styles in this CD, including orchestral sounds.<br /><br />The guitar sounds new, richer, thicker and smoother-Marshall amps; I don't know how they did the double and tripple sounds, is it effects or actuall playing? The music itself is supreme. I believe this to be Joe Satriani's best ablum so far.<br /><br />All songs offer great and melodious guitar, you have to listen carefully to the tone. After a while it becomes difficult to press stop. I recommend this for all types of listeners as this album has elements of so many different and yet beautifully woven together styles.<br /><br />Thank you.
B00CRR5YA0|5.0|Giacchino is really mastering his movie making role! This Soundtrack has the right balance of themes, as well as action packed and emotional score tracks. Even though I loved his previous work in Super 8 and John Carter, I think they were a little bit over-melodic specially on Super 8.<br /><br />Star Trek into Darkness is as good as it gets for a Star Trek movie and this soundtrack will allow you to revisit and relive the thrilling emotional ride of the film. This soundtrack works perfectly for the movie, just like Giacchino's \\"Lost\\" soundtracks worked perfectly for the series (talk about composing music for sequels - 6 Lost Seasons).<br /><br />Two Thumbs Up!!!
0140282033|5.0|Great views of humanity. Find your parents, friends, enemies in these characters. Besides I have to have a daily chocolate fix.<br />Glory
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The writing in this book is SUPERB.  It is relatable, because who hasn't felt like the outcast or freak at some point in their youth.  The journal style writing was inventive and actually worked very well here.  It was a page turner for me, right up until the shocking twist at the end.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Not your typical game. Very in depth and makes you think. Sucks you right in and you can't stop playing.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is a heartbreaker, but the writing was solid and the characters were so well crafted.  I could picture them and who they were and feel each of their individual sufferings.
B004TI1WME|4.0|easy to use , nice big numbers I can use it without makine a mistake. Nice to have in my kindel
B004TI5N38|2.0|Not Baldacci's best work.  He had to struggle with useless verbiage to tell the story.  Hopefully this is not the trend for his future works.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Scribblenauts is the most fun and creative game there is. It's not like every other easy one solution game on the kindle store. You have to be creative and imaginative to play this amazing game.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Best app for convert music on youtube. So easy to use and fast too. Get it and will love it.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I really like the features as well as the look of this alarm app. The color and dimming feature is subdued in a dark room. I travel frequently and it's nice to wake up to both music and the weather on a single app!
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Love this game. Had the free version and was disappointed that it was only a partial part if game had to purchase full version
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|My cable that came with my Kindle must have grown legs and walked off.  Anyway I replaced it with this one, which is just as good as the original.  No complaints.
B004TI1WME|5.0|This is a very good calculator app.<br />I used the free version and it's great to get the pro version for free.<br />Love it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book to be honest it's that type of book that will really inspire everyday life.<br />I felt like I really connected with Charlie I hope to read it again
B005ORVMT2|4.0|Here are some notes just for people who, like me, own or otherwise have access to several versions and are wondering about these boxes or the new 24/96 downloads in terms of sound quality.  Short answer is that this set has a couple of gems in it (and I don't think the other boxes necessarily do).  Can't comment on the 5.1 mixes, since mine is a stereo-only household.  Regarding the whole effort, I'd say that what needs to happen more is faithful remixes  of the multitrack tapes rather than simple transfer/tweaking of the master tape--consider what Steve Wilson was able to do with Aqualung, for instance.  I'm not sure what shape the multitracks of Rush are in, of course, but I think I'm still waiting for a \\"great\\" mastering of this catalog.  Note, too, that I'm just knit-picking here.  For rocking out with a sixer, any version works very well!<br /><br />One interesting point here is that it's the first time I've been able to compare a purchased 24-bit commercial download (HDTracks) with 16/44 (CD) files of the same mastering.  Result: any differences are totally elusive, and I have a good \\"budget audiophile\\" system.  I did several side-by-side comparisons between tracks on 2112 and Fly By Night, the two best recordings in the Sector 1 disc (sonically the best).  I remained in the \\"are the drums sharper in 24 bits, or is it my imagination?\\" mode, except when I was just as likely to be mistaken on which format I was listening to!  As well as moments of \\"hey, the CD has a wider sound stage, doesn't it?\\"  In short, too much imagination, too little real difference.  So, the 24-bit downloads are not appreciably better than CD, even for a buyer who is highly concerned with sound quality and has invested his admitedly modest earnings accordingly.  My hearing is good, even though I've listened to Rush for 30 years and that does take a toll.  I judge recordings on finer points through Grado 225i headphones and I hear the majority of features that \\"audiophiles\\" report hearingon CD recordings (whether I agree with their opinions about them or not).  It may be that soundstage breadth/depth are more apparent on a well-placed set of speakers...Maybe.  Greater bit depth, when it helps, eleviates a \\"boxed in\\" sound on a volume-maximized recording, letting the soundstage grow wider; while higher bitrates can make rapid transient frequencies sound more natural.  But if the master doesn't produce either of these issues, and if it's not a native 24-bit recording (e.g., 21st Century), higher res won't be likely to make a difference.  So if you've got this box, nevermind the download.<br /><br />Sound quality on these discs (and the 24-bit downloads for sale)  is a mixed bag.  First, as others have noted, all are compressed.  Not \\"brickwalled,\\" but they are roughly equal in loudness to the 97 remasters.  Also, yes, trebble has been boosted, but it's fine to my ears.  It does become an issue on Fly By Night and Hold Your Fire, on both of which the top of Geddy's voice and the high-hats can sound borderline shrill due to what's happening on the original tape (or microphone).<br />My method for comparing discs is to rip them all \\"losslessly\\" and apply replay-gain so that peak volumes are matched--it's like twisting the volume knob to compensate for the fact that the older discs aren't volume-maximized.  Unlike normalization, replay-gain does not compromise the dynamics.  Without this step, then yeah, compressed mastering sounds more exciting and \\"better.\\"  But flip the volume knob up a bit on the older discs and that distinction will often not only disappear, but also the greater dynamic range on the quieter discs makes for a more life-like sound, especially when you crank it (as people have been known to do with Rush).<br />  Ok, the discs from Box 1:<br /><br />Self-titled album - My recollection is that the original Mercury \\"Atomic\\" CD I own (haven't pulled it back out) was hissy and not well-defined.  The Sector 24-bit download is better, especially in the definition of the bass frequencies, than the Japanese SHM-CD.  Sector CD should be the same as the download, but I haven't put it on.<br /><br />The live albumbs from Sectors 1 and 2, just because of the source tapes themselves, have EXTREMELY poor sound quality, and I wasn't able to listen to more than a few seconds of them before jumping ship.  Not an issue with this particular version: they just had limitations when they were recorded.  Fine for casual listening.<br /><br />Fly by Night - This is exceptional in the Sector CD (fixed version).  Better than the Japanese SHM-CD that is sometimes available.  Wider sound stage, sharper: generationally-better source tapes, I'd say. So, as others have noted, this is a stand-out success of the Sector boxes.  I don't think I ever owned the original CD, but only a remaster from 94 or so, long since lost, so can't compare those to the SHM.<br /><br />Caress of Steel - I actually prefer the SHM CD to the Sector CD and 24-bit versions on this one.  I suspect that the SHM was taken from the first Japanese pressing, since the SHM is a bit clearer and more \\"involving\\" than my Mercury original or  the Sectors box.  Maybe the sector version does something else that I'm not hearing yet.  What's interesting is that the SHM has the drums more out front and overall has a much punchier sound.  I've done this comparison on several occasions now and at several points: SHM is just plain punchier on bass and drums by a bit.  Nothing \\"wrong\\" with the Vandette version, though.  Maybe the tapes just aren't in as good a shape as they used to be.<br /><br />2112 - For me, this one is the revelation on the box set.  My point of reference is the MFSL version (I haven't heard the SHM or any other remasters).  Although people who dislike the MFSL point to the brightness (big treble boost), that's about the same as on the Sector box.  What I notice comparing them side by side is that the MFSL sounds like it has the mid-range sucked out ofit, much the same way as the Pink Floyd MFSL titles.  The MFSL is a \\"polite\\" recording.  It bested the original for me a couple of years ago when I got it, but now the Sector box smashes the MFSL, IMO.<br /><br />I'm posting a separate review for Sector 2 that'll also handle Sector 3.  Those boxes are not particularly winners in my tests, whereas this one mostly is.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|A very humanist read. Enjoyable and engaging. It quietly draws you into the lives of the characters.You will be surprised at the ending.
B00499QUK2|5.0|I love the way they film his deductions, the text is great.  I first discoved this show while on maternity leave, and i was thrilled to find it on amazon prime!
B003JTHXOK|3.0|It was recommended to me as a great book, but I wasn't a  impressed.  It was an ok read.  Thanks
193700788X|2.0|The title says it all. Frankly, the last few books were not as good as the first ones. It is what it is. From the 1 star reviews I went in expecting worse, so was pleasantly surprised by the first 2/3. Then CH wrapped it up with a fizzle. Ker-plop. Like Alka Seltzer sans relief.<br /><br />I'm not going into details in the case that you decide to read for yourself. But I do urge you to wait a little while till the price drops. Or some used copies roll in.<br />Trust me, you can wait.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|I thought this movie was very similar to the book and I liked the parts that they did change.  If I had not have read the book the movie might be a little confusing and hard to follow but I loved the book and thought this movie was a good portrayal of it.  The special effects were fantastic along with the actors playing different characters.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|Kathy Reichs always delivers exciting books for her readers.  I really enjoy the mix of  history, geography, the forensic evidence and of course the blending of old and new characters.  I was pleased that there might still be the possibility of Ryan and Tempe getting together.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|For the first run, its very good, dose the 3D rendering very well. The puzzles themselves are sufficiently hard enough to keep you busy for hours. For the price, definitely a must buy.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|Another great app download from Amazon's app of the day. This calculator has a ton of features I will probably never use, but it's great to have. Thank you Amazon for these apps!!!
B00BVYKWJI|4.0|I had to call twice to improve the download.  It is hard to watch this when you get constantly disconnected.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Can overclock, officially works with faster than 1600 Mhz memory (turn on XMP in BIOS). A big advantage over the core i3 series is that the core i5 uses PCIe 3 instead of PCIe 2, so graphics will work at full speed weather using the onboard Intel HD Graphics 4000 or a graphics card. Of course, you have to also choose a motherboard that supports all these features. I haven't actually compared it to a core i3, but it's blazing compared to my old dual core Athlon 64 (no surprise there I guess).
1558908382|4.0|Lots of music to remind you of the 80's, in this case it's a good thing! Love John Cusack, Minnie Driver and Dan Aykroyd is insanely funny in this!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|jj abrams has done it again, don't care what anybody has to say this movie has it all, and then some more..........and more. abrams has done one heck of a job with this.......just came back from seeing it with the family (all 6) everyone loved it......i have seen a good deal of movies over the years but, i  would rather see them at home.  this is one of the very very fue movies i have seen that i can say i enjoyed in the theater. can't see how anyone can say that abrams has lost his touch.  the second this movies ended i turned to my wife and said...i'm ready for part 3, i can't wait for the dvd (as soon as possible) (next week i hope) lets see its may that means oct. CAN'T WAIT........the sooner they get this on dvd/bluray the better.  if you liked the last film i really can't see why you would not like this. from my hole family its a++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ thanks jj you are one heck of a writer and director.  can't wait to see what you do with star wars.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I am a adult and I just love this movies...I guess I am a big kid at heart.  I loved the little yellow characters they were so cute in the movie.  I recommend this movie for the whole family to see..

B00AB7HESI|5.0|I heard good things about this one. It's a fun sandbox to mess with for me and a great learning tool for my pre-k son. He solves puzzles using a mix of creativity and spelling. Wonderful experience.
B0019N95IK|1.0|For me to actually sit here and type a review can only mean one thing:<br />1) I absolutely LOVE something and want total strangers on the net to know, or<br />2) I HAVE to warn people about pending disaster, hate, evil, or if they are about to step into doodoo.<br /><br />I speak not to the star trek aficionado, who will watch trek, any trek, as long as it IS trek. There will be hate, love, discussion, anger, happiness, etc amongst us who are of the trek. There is no point in telling any of us what we already know, that this show stinks.........<br /><br />I am directing this to the innocent fool who never really got into star trek, but is curious of what this series has to offer. With the advent of the new hack and slash, \\"let's attract as many people as we can to the franchise and give the finger to the fans\\", movies that are coming out, many are probably skimming amazon to learn and digest more trek, at least I hope. If this is you, and you are reading this, immediately search for star trek deep space nine and buy that.<br /><br />Listen to me, and listen carefully. Star Trek Enterprise was a prequel (and I probably need not say more) that was conceived by Satan and his disciple, namely Rick Berman and Brannon Braga. These two animals took an incredible series (or franchise as the bankers call it) and destroyed what once was magnificent social commentary set in space. This show stinks. Why? Well read the 1 star ratings and find out! Oh you won't? Why? Because you feel that those who gave it a 1 star are cynical, evil dwarves who just want to hate? Maybe. But the truth is, It really is poorly done.<br /><br />Where do I begin?<br /><br />Why rehash what we already know, and disrupt canon, when you could easily have explored the birth of the federation and its' member species. You want conflict? Well let there be conflict between these, instead of bringing in the romulans, the borg (!) etc.<br /><br />Ira Steven Behr and Michael Piller (from ds9 and tng as well for Piller) is what is needed once again. Why won't the studio fund a 3 part mini series on the events following the dominion war to see if anyone will watch? I guarantee there will be interest. People don't like prequals (doesn't take a genius to realize this) but they do like continuity, character development, etc. Let's put it this way. The show Dallas has been off the air for umpteen years, and they just brought it back, same characters and a few new ones, to critical acclaim! What does this tell you? We want more of what we love. We want to see familiar faces. We want what works.<br /><br />I can go on and on, but my fingers hurt and I'm feeling sick thinking about Rick Berman and Brannon Braga. If you see either of these cretins in the street, please profer 'the bird' to them for me. They deserve it.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|A good movie with plenty plot mixed perfectly with action. Also Robert Downey Jr. is both cynical and hilarious. A definite must watch.
0525478817|5.0|This book will stick with you long after you finish reading it. Absolute perfection. CANNOT wait to see the movie!
0525478817|5.0|I'm not a teenager; I'm not a weeper; I scorn attempts to play on my emotions by books / movies / tv shows. I knew how this book would end after the first few pages. Why then did I end up crying for the last 200 pages of this book? Probably because John Green made me care more about the characters than their disease. No one close to me (and certainly no children) has died of cancer, so I wasn't identifying with the trials of a horrible, debilitating illness. BUT, I do remember the intensity of first love and I can imagine having the specter of imminent death hanging over you - as opposed to the illusion of invincibility that most young people have.<br /><br />Hazel and Augustus do seem more verbal and thoughtful than most people their age, but then they have been through more than most people of any age. I understand Hazel retreating into the world of a favorite book, and wanting to know what HAPPENS after after the ending - isn't that a metaphor for her abbreviated life?<br /><br />I heard good things about this book but like a lot of people I was put off when I heard about the subject matter - kids with cancer? no thanks. Unfortunately, the fact that it is classed as Young Adult will also put off many older people - and it shouldn't. This is a book for anyone over the age of 14 or so who loves sharp dialogue and heartbreakingly real characters. And the the catharsis of a good cry.
B006G7Y7GY|5.0|I'm not an Ozzy fan but enjoy reading autobiographies. This book was very entertaining and I was really impressed that he takes full responsibility for everything he's done over the years. I especially enjoyed the stories of his life before Black Sabbath. Great read!
B0044C5SCU|4.0|Though akin to X-files, Fringe is the latest version release with a 21st century plot kine subject. Good show, hits on many topics.  Eugenics, Transhumanism and the ever growing hubris of man to create his environment in his own image. Though we all know this is a futile effort, and unfortunately, like Icarus we will collide too. This show is mostly the truth hidden in plain sight. Artist and writers using fiction to depict elements of truth. Too bad it was cancelled.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I am never disappointed with Agent Pendergast.  Over the years he has become one of my best friends in the book world...lol
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Still a good Book. Was reading the other 2 Books. The ending was different. Is there a 4th Book coming?
B001MM28JG|5.0|Love it! Fun for the whole family. Reminds me of the Star Trek kids that totally geek out with it but with this movie it's all real! Lol
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Was really good Book. A little different as normal, but really good. A friend told me about the first Book.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This product works just as advertised, I keep my SLR, 3 lenses, a POS, extra batteries, flash, and lens hoods in here with no problems.  My tripod clips to the outside to make a nice compact package.  I mainly just use this to store all the equipment, I'm not sure I would go hiking with all this stuff, but if I did this is what I would take.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I liked the 2nd Book too. I was reading the first one. It was different, but good. Thanks a lot.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is one of the best game I have played in years.  You really have to think, which makes it good.  The graphics are exceptional and the music adds to the adventure.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I confess I'm addicted to this show.  Of course the series has an interesting plot line (maligned, humiliated housewife morphs before our eyes into top flight attorney with corresponding money, sex and power), but Ms Margolies plays her part with volcanic reserve.  She is magnificent.  Week after week the writers  come up with interesting twists in the law and human nature.  Alicia's bosses, Pamela and Will, are terrific characters with a lot of complexity.  Her cheating husband, played by the uber-successful TV actor Chris Noth, is also complicated.  No easy to recognize villains in this series. What more can I say?  I love this show.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Game is a lot of fun, when you just want to unwind and nor think much.  The graphics are extremely good on the Kindle Fire HD
B005DD7H50|4.0|This Fincheresquely-filmed movie starring fellow barrel-maker Bradley is a lot of fun and deals with some very interesting ideas; but in order to preserve the mass-appeal necessary to make back its budget, the implications of these ideas are sometimes given short shrift.<br /><br />For example, how are people's motivations affected by increased brain performance?  Are we to assume that since Bradley was a 'good guy' to begin with he wants to use his 4-digit IQ (good lord) to help humanity as a politician, and that the Russian 'bad guy' only has the acquisition of filthy lucre as his aim after becoming smart?  In other words, that a person's deepest desires remain unaffected by intelligence?  This is too simple and black-and-white; but it's understandable because these kinds of questions are better handled along the arc of a TV series rather than a 2-hour film.  Even so, I'd have preferred to see Bradley's newfound cognitive skills lead him to the selfish core of what had been his writing ambition and turn him into a monstrous cult leader, and for the Russian to have become a philanthropic engineer bent on inventing a process to provide cheap renewable energy.<br /><br />Another more relevant issue, though, is why does big pharma seem to be more interested in turning off our thoughts and feelings than in turning them on?  One interpretation of the film is that turning them on would precipitate lost time, headaches, and eventual death; but really the film doesn't address this question at all.  And that's what limits it more than anything else.
B00A77II0U|4.0|Really enjoyed this game, only con is that it is pretty short. The graphics are good and it had some challenge to it as well.
B004X2M3N8|5.0|With a different producer and writer, Doctor Who returns to the mainstay of ongoing stories that run a season long.  This opening chapter was so engaging that I wished it kept on going.
B00BT0ZDF2|5.0|I have not seen a more entertaining film, Cloud Atlas is amazing.  From beginning to end this movie is brilliant.
B000OVLINI|4.0|Overall, I really enjoyed this book. I was pulled in from the beginning. The characters felt human; they made mistakes.<br /><br />There were a few times I got frustrated and I might have stopped reading. The information we were learning along with the main character was so confusing and difficult to make sense of (part of what makes the book good, I now know), that I just wanted to give up. I had trouble remembering all the bits and pieces. Luckily, there's a nice summary of everything towards the end that explains it all from start to finish, or I might have thrown the book out the window.<br /><br />Daniel, the main character, is truly a young boy that doesn't know what he's getting into. He's just curious. I'm glad it wasn't easy for him, it made it seem that much more real. Fermin was a wonderful character. I would love to have a friend like him. I'm not sure I cared much for Bea, her character wasn't developed very well, in my opinion. I also would have liked to have seen more of Daniel's father. Lain Coubert was a frightening character, for good reason as we find out in the end. I could say more about many more characters, but I don't want to give too much away.<br /><br />So why did I rate this 4 out of 5? Because in the end, it was a really well written story and I wanted to know what happened and therefore kept reading. I'm also a sucker for happy endings.
B000002I8E|5.0|I recently went to the thrift shop and found what I thought to be this cassette.. unfortunately it wasnt. It was still Phil Collins, but just not Face Value, as soon as I noticed I ordered this baby. It got here in like 4 days, which is amazing and it works perfectly!

B004GJDQT8|2.0|I like the web versions of the store and of webpages not the app version of this. Maybe I am cut from a different cloth, but that is just what one brother likes. Nothing bad about the the app per se, I just do not enjoy the experience it provides.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This app is amazing, plus it's free so there is no reason you shouldn't download it! It's so adorable and kind of addictive. I love the music that plays in the background too.
1400079276|4.0|The book is one of my favorites of Murakami. He is smart and this story is very confusing. He is not a great writer, or at least the English transitions do not move me. Reading Murakami is more like an experience. He writes like a very messed-up dream. It is less about reading this book, but more like experiencing it. It is not about the story, but the experience. In that aspect, he is a true master of his craft.

B005K17RU0|5.0|Pretty accurate app. I like to use it to plan my weekends. More times than not its right on. Also like the radar
B008AK8FHM|2.0|Good story and very interesting, but a very slow read. I felt the climax came too early and then the rest was just boring.
B00475BUVM|5.0|I just love this movie but they made it in a 3D and it was amazing to watch it, i watch it all the time
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I was ...hmm... pleasantly (is to mild) surprised when I read this book... I loved it! well done,clean,crisp, wonder full, I do mean full of wonder and the end... bravo!
B006JSXYPA|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. if they had them all in 3D I would buy them all. a great way to end my night
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its ok for a four year old but i play it. I would like it if it didn't have all the timing thing
B008EPGIBI|5.0|this is one of the kind movie's I would tell my Friend about this movie and were to go to get it
B0064MPXFA|5.0|One of the best shows on TV now.  Sorry I missed it the first time around.  I will continue to watch the remaining episodes in the series.
B004TI1WME|5.0|It's like having a tape to double check entries not to mention the ability to have multiple calculations back to back.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I liked it because of the relevance of social media in our society today.  I think all parents should read this book to help them get more perspective on the impact social media has on their children of all ages.  Can't say enough about it the book.  Beautifully written and tells a most profound tale.
B0000542DJ|2.0|Roger Ebert comments on JFK in his The Great Movies.  His writing has moved me to raise my rating of this film (to 2 stars).<br /><br />Roger Ebert acknowledges that the content of JFK is trash, as far as the facts go, but that one should view the film not as a telling of what happened during and after that fateful day, but on an emotional level:  How we felt about what happened.<br /><br />Ebert even mentions Gerald Posner's book Case Closed in his review, a book that fully accounts for all the \\"unexplained\\" aspects of the assassination, although Ebert apparently missed Posner's explanation of the alleged 3 shots in 2.6 seconds (they were fired in 5 seconds, based on the open microphone acoustics revealed in the book).<br /><br />So enjoy the film, if you must, but only on the level of \\"emotion.\\"<br /><br />If you want to find out about the JFK assassination and the subsequent investigations, read Gerald Posner's Case Closed.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie does a good job of transferring the book to the screen.  Wonderful acting.  This is definitely a \\"rewatch\\" movie.
B004LI21KY|5.0|A brilliant film.<br /><br />Ignore all the hype about \\"propaganda\\" and watch it for what it is: A groundbreaking and influential masterpiece.<br /><br />UCSC social psychologist Elliot Aronson defined the difference between propaganda and education as whether you like the message or don't like the message. If you can ignore the message, or even if you can't, and pay attention to the medium, you will be richly rewarded.
B005ZTFPFQ|5.0|The controls take a while to get used to, but when you do this is not a bad game at all. I paid the $9.99 to get all 99 games and it is worth the price. Several people think they got ripped off because they expected all games for .99 cents. It clearly says that Missile Command is free and the other games cost .99 each or get all 99 for 9.99! Read before you buy!
B000LJAEFG|2.0|1980s electronic hardware chugging and smoking.<br /><br />Thirty minutes to cut through a plastic door lock, using a carbide power saw.<br /><br />Psychobabble in abundance.<br /><br />The promise of soft core porn, hardly delivered. Skip this one in a hurry.
B005COO1X6|4.0|Everything King writes, makes me keep turning the pages. This is another great story with that touch of the supernatural. Like always, I was sad that it ended
B00BT0ZDF2|5.0|Please note that I saw this on a movie channel so that I can't comment on the quality of the DVD release or its features.<br /><br />The movie quite simply deserves to win the Oscar this year. The top notch ensemble cast, great acting, terrific script, and multiple plot and story lines really put the movie in a category by itself. Then there's the amazing makeup jobs, as each actor often appears four, five, or six times in different roles, sometimes even changing gender (the Susan Sarandon male character was amazing) and looks completely different each time. This movie would have required a whole team of makeup artists. Whoever they were my hat's off to them, and whoever the head makeup technician was he or she was probably exhausted by the end of this movie trying to manage it all and keep everything on schedule.<br /><br />Many people have already discussed the Buddhist themes of the movie, so I'll just say that the way the movie unfolds over 500 years as each character is born and reborn into a completely different life made for a very ambitious and complex movie as the settings, characters, and story/plot are completely different each time. The movie follows a small group of people whose lives are inextricably intertwined, and their lives continue to cross and re-cross with the cycle of birth and rebirth throughout the movie. The constant changes in time and place make much greater demands on the viewer's attention, so be forewarned that it's probably not a movie to watch if you're just looking for some relaxing, mindless entertainment after a tough day on the job. Just the amount of violence in the movie may put some viewers off as can be seen from some of the reviews and comments here.<br /><br />I never read the book as I don't read much fiction these days, but this movie really made me want to pick up the book and it's now on my short list. This movie is a tour de force in several ways and I hope it wins the Oscar this year as it really deserves it.
B00AQNOCZ0|5.0|Read all the books in about a month so of course i needed the box set.  Don't skimp and go with the DVD's, Blu-Ray is the only way to go.  NIce extra's as well.
B007P7UF0G|5.0|I was so happy to see this dvd that I purchased one for myself and another for a friend who also loved it! This is hardly seen on tv these days and is such a great movie with great actors and I enjoy the songs so much.  i highly recommend if you love musicals!
B0091REZMW|4.0|Get diamonds.there the best I could care less about the review .just don't get screwed paying money for the s***. It is just a game
B007OWG3LM|5.0|What can I say !? Another Sigur Ros that I love. After reading other reviews where some people did not like it compared to the previous ones, I was a little skeptical and it took me several month before I could decide to buy it.  This one is very serene, very peaceful. I do not regret this buy at all.
B00ANVX6DY|5.0|I bought this for my 4 1/2 year old grand daughter and we have been watching it together almost every day when she comes here after pre-school.<br />I'm enjoying it as much as she is. The relationships and the values are excellent. This is a great way for her to learn about the positive traits that are acted out in this DVD.<br />And to top it all off, there is a \\"Guest Appearance\\" by Cinderella who sings about her regrets in not sticking it out with her stepsisters -- excellent advice for Sophia<br />to try again with her step sister, Amber.<br />I just bought the 5 little dolls of Sophia and her family so we can play with them in Dora's Magic Castle (hope Dora will share!!)<br />And three of the books for starting readers.<br />And, yes, I am really into this too! It's a great way to teach about healthy relationships.
193700788X|5.0|I love this because the book is really good at tying everything up in the end. It's a great read for lover's of HBO's True Blood or the Southern Vampire Series. Amazon was great!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I had a Canon backpack before, this one is very similar to it but cheaper.  I even had it from Amazon Warehouse with a good deal.
B0095P3ULC|5.0|I liked the movie and the quality of the picture was really good but then again I have a good internet conection speed.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|Loved this movie, watched it on TV and had to miss the very last few minutes. Had to buy it to watch the end, it was that good.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Read this in 3 days because it just better and better until there was a slight disappointment at the end. A new character at the closing curtain was not a good development and his introduction into this story made little sense.<br /><br />But aside from the above-described flaw, the book was just outstanding and all consuming. Flynn is a good writer and a lot of her descriptive accounts will stay with me for a long time to come.
B005ZMTYTQ|5.0|Good story but more films should be made<br />Actors all were good in the film<br />Good science fiction story<br />Good
B009NY43NY|3.0|I gave this three stars because now I never have to read another Sookie book. I was so looking forward to the conclusion of this series since I had high hopes the author would \\"perk up\\" the finale' but no such luck! I blew through this in record time, even finding myself skipping paragraphs to get it over.  I actually did expect Sookie would end up with Sam but thought we would, at the very least, get some action out of the Eric relationship.  I haven't watched True Blood although I've been told it was awesome...now I don't know if it would be worth it! So disappointed!
1616550414|4.0|This is really big. It has great artwork and great pictures that span entire pages. Most of it is taken up with character sketches. It includes the official game timeline and a manga story at the end. I do wish there was a bit more about game development than there is. More behind the scenes in that aspect would make it really interesting. But it does have some and that is great.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Well written shoe that has a different plot each and every episode.  One of the few TV series that never slips into a predictable and redundant pattern.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|So the details are a bit off from reality, such as the law, the clothes, talking on cell phones without dialing first - but the legal strategies and inter-relationships between the characters are great.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This game is so awesome and the controls are great I love this game but It did not work and accidentally some how did work so sorry.. for the yahoo mail comment..anyway I will still give this a five star rateing because this is the best game I ever Seen in my life and its recommended for every one to me and I Loooooooovvvvveee this game the graphics,controls,speach,story,gameplay etc its all awesome thank you for making this awesome game gamloft you Rule you are on top of every thing &pound;!! So buy this game and you will be blown away just like I WAS. It is the you Rule speach to gameloft!!
B005544V6A|5.0|Great acting, great (unrealistic) clothes, great drama, interesting legal maneuvering, even if the details of the practice of law are off.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this game.  I just wish it was longer!  I definitely gave my brain a workout and I am looking forward to a sequel!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I started this awesome book this morning. I actually just finished reading the last chapter. The whole time I had a permanent smile because it's such a great story. Anyone young or old will enjoy it, I promise! It honestly made me want to go snuggle up to my husband. If this love story doesn't make you feel good about your significant other I don't know what will!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is a fun ! I bet you love it! you collect money and buy animals.you should get this game!
B00632HWOG|4.0|Easy app to check your Yahoo email. Wish it had sorting capability. Lacks many of the features on the Yahoo mail PC version.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Love this show and it just keeps getting better and better!! Now the best part is that our favorite crime fighting duo is together, and Caskett is better than ever bc of it! If you haven't seen it, you have to!
B0040HO01Y|5.0|The characters are well developed. I love how the storyline shifts between Lark Rise and Candleford. Just finished Season 1 and can't wait to get into Season 2.
B005J9ZDYK|5.0|This Season is WideScreen not Full Screen, its written Full Screen, i prefrere the Full Screen , my kids loved it
B009NG1Q96|5.0|The Elite picks up where The Selection left off with Maxon's last 6 girls.  In this book, we see Maxon & America's relationship growing, as well as Maxon's relationships with the other girls.  America still struggles back and forth trying to decide whether or not there's really something between her and Maxon & Maxon is still fighting to show her that there is.<br /><br />However, after a devastating event with one of The Elite, America starts to doubt everything about her current situation.  She starts to make some reckless decisions and I can't help but wonder if there will be consequences for the decisions she is making.  Although some of her choices may not be very wise, America doesn't lose her sense of self through all of this.  She is essentially the same person that she's always been.  She's passionate, caring, and has a strong sense of justice.  We also get to know a few more characters a little better in this book which I'm sure will come into play in the next book.<br /><br />This book definitely sets the story up for at least a third book, kind of leaving the reader hanging.  But in this series and with the way it's written, it actually worked for me.  I'm becoming a very big fan of Kiera Cass.  She's quickly becoming one of my favorite authors for her imaginative story lines and wonderful writing.  I highly recommend this book and this series!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great show leaving me just to want more episodes....they always leave you thinking how are they going to get out of this one?
B000JMKQX0|2.0|Love to read and want something that flows..Very choppy because you are jumping from this to that in the storyline.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|After looking for a hack n slash dungeon crawled for some time, I saw an ad for this game while playing World at War.  I'm only level 9 so far but the graphics and gameplay are great.  Because I'm not paying for in game items, it will probably take me much longer to complete, but since I'm playing it to pass the time this isnt an issue!
193700788X|3.0|It was not as bad as others have said. I just for the first time ever read the entire series. And I kind of guessed all along Sookie would end up with Sam. I was not surprised that Eric married the Queen, he made it clear he had no choice long ago and I thought the last three books were all about them both coming to accept the inevitable. At least Eric protected her as best he could. The weirdest part was Quinn coming back to help then leaving again. The interaction between Quinn and Sookie did not ring true. There was no passion between them as there had been in the past and no regrets or anything. Weird. This was not a true ending to the series, I expected Sookie to die, or be turned, or get custody of Hunter somehow, not just continue on as she has in past books. I guess all her enemies are dead and now she can love Sam, sunbath, read, and wait tables for the rest of her life. Boring!!!
B008HK3XOU|2.0|I should of sent this back because the magnet does not work, I am not sure it has a magnetic in it. I kept it because I needed the case and I love the color. I would not recommend this to anyone, because I would be afraid that their magnet wouldn't work.
B005CRQ3RK|4.0|The last straw was a very good book I really enjoyed it I have read it at my school library but sadly I  never got to finish it and now I just did.

B00AAQWMB4|3.0|If you do not know what your doing, level 1 will be chaos. once you get used to it than you will start to win a few. app is hard to navigate if you since there is not a menu button on screen. I found the menu screen on accident.
B000NVIXDW|3.0|great gift for her<br />one two three four five six seven eight nine ten elven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Thought this movie really speaks volumes for the real family. People that are not all perfect. I loved how things fall together in this and make sence. A man that is in delusion of a relationship that seemed to have never been right from the start and a women who just can't seem to find herself after loosing the person that matters most.. an epic story with all of the truthfullness of true life not just movie script.
B0018PXEI6|4.0|just as I remember it from long ago<br /><br />one two three four five six seven eight nine ten elven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen.
B0091REZMW|3.0|This game me is ok I'm not that  fond of searching games though so I'm not that great of a judge I guess

B008N4XC2I|5.0|One of the great albums of recent times and one of the best Muse. It is worth taking time to enjoy this fabulous band, the great sound of their music and the wonderful experience of listening on vinyl.<br /><br />Uno de los grandes discos de los últimos tiempos y uno de los mejores de Muse. Vale la pena tomarse un tiempo para disfrutar esta fabulosa banda, el gran sonido de su música y la maravillosa experiencia de escucharla en Vinilo.
B005HSL626|5.0|I saw my little niece playing it and knew I had to play also!! Yes it's fun for adults too!!!!
B006RXQC2Y|5.0|What a beautiful movie, so sad I waited so long to watch it. One of my new favorites! Can't go wrong with a Romance movie :-)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This a very good game the characters are cool and the powerups are amazing dead trigger kindle fire university of Texas and the US government is that the new version is available for download from the new version of glass and the powerhouse are
B0098XY5VK|5.0|I really like the game, it's fun and addicting. I like the different items that's added as you go along.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I like this book band I read it it helps me to remembered this dictionary book and nice and advanced
B00632HWOG|3.0|It ok because I can ceck my mail but I couldn't use it as my default mail box on my kindle fire.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Such a helpful app. Especially if you forget to put your phone on the charger the night before you have to wake up early.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I think it is a reliable, user friendly calculator that gives you a lot of options. I recommend this to everyone.
B006PKQQJS|5.0|I love this game, it's so addicting. I'm obsessed with making all my customers leave full of hearts! Can't wait to get to my next level and the challenge level is awesome.
0812982622|2.0|The book was horrifying in the depiction of the lives of the citizens of N. Korea. Should be required High School reading.
B008X6N1OA|3.0|there were too many annoying and unnecessary characters...betweeen the mammoth teens, the sea characters, senile granny, and so on. j-lo, drake, and niki minaj as voices? sorry but they brought nothing to the table either. the movie was okay to watch once, but i think it would be torture to sit through repeat viewings.
B003K15IF8|5.0|This is a compelling book that somehow fell out of style for several years and was not read nearly as much as it deserved to be. A real accomplishment.
B009K86D86|5.0|Very informative and a bit disturbing as well. A must see for those who care to know a bit of how the food industry operates.
B00CL50LEC|5.0|This is a very different zombie flick, and not a bad different either. I love anything zombie (usually) and this one didn't disappoint. It's more of a Romeo and Juliet zombie love story with lots of humor added. Very different idea on how it can possibly be cured.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I enjoy the challenges in this game.  I like the various holidays it represents.  It is fun and promotes hand eye coordination.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Years ago I read a novel which included a murder and trial of a youth. Disturbing but fascinating. Defending Jacob was in the same vein...disturbing but fascinating. I thought it brilliant how the author started the book and continued on with the storyteller, the dad, on the stand. As a parent myself, I felt for the parents, however, was truly annoyed and at times, angery with Jacob. This is a great book club discussion because of all the emotions it can illicit.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Again I enjoy the callenge the games give in using hand eye coordination.  The various animations in the product are entertaining.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is fun and addicting! You can replay all your favorite mini games any time. Great to play while in waiting rooms.
0316056898|5.0|I mean honestly, who doesn't love Tina Fey? If you said 'me' then you might want to skip this review :-) I loved every minute of reading this book. It's honest, open, insightful, and of course hilarious. Getting a glimpse into her thought process, family life, and career was entertaining and admirable. If you enjoy her sense of humor, women in the workplace, and non photoshopped pictures of arm fat give this book a go
B00992CF6W|5.0|you cant blow up Tnt because theirs no flint and steel so that kink of makes no sense because u have the iron hoe but no tint and steel .
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|the over all story wasn't bad...it was well acted...appreciated the historical angle, but it was still predicable...enjoyed Tom Hardy's performance.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|I enjoyed watching this movie. All of the actors do a great job portraying the mind set of each person. I would recommend it to others.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Fun game to play.  But I can't figure out where the coins come out.  Maybe they just give you credits toward your next purchase. Lol
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|I am in search of a job to rejoin the workforce.  I believe LinkedIn is going to be a tremendous help in that aspect.

B002HK9IDQ|5.0|The Lenore and Lowe music is perturb.  The story is terrific. Rex Harrison and Audrey Hepburn were so great together in this marvelous movie.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|After paying my 2.99, download did not work. Now cant figure out how to get my money back. We went to the library and got the DVD, we watched it. Great movie.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|its a time occupying game of sort,  if you like fun games give it a try, its fun and its ok.
B00BT0ZDF2|3.0|I had been waiting over 9 months to watch this, and was prepared to buy at least 10 copies to send to friends and family. That's how excited I was about this movie! However they pushed the boundaries of their rating beyond their limits!!! It ought to have been rated triple RRR, or X. There was so much graphic violence and porn as well as superfluous use of the F-word, so as to have it lose its effect, that there is no one that I could possibly send it to, that would not afterwards cut off all contact with me, and lose all respect for me. I don't know anyone that would not be offended by its content, which is sad, because the premise behind it is soooo absolutely TRUE! I ought to have just kept watching the trailer. After removing inappropriate content, that is about what you are left with. I had no issue with the flow of the scenes however from story to story, as some complain about. You get the same thing watching soaps! :) Lol.The flow was fine.
B007N85ZXY|5.0|bought this cd for my boyfriend, he likes their type of music and he liked receiving the cd and listening to music,

B005HSL626|5.0|this game is soooooooooooooooooo cool it is better than candy crush you can get different backgrounds and knifes when you get a high score
B005GYGCOI|1.0|I did read Mr Wray's review about how inept this kindle version was before I bought it. I did download a sample. So I did know what I was getting into. I simply did not a) want to lug the 1250 page paper version or b) Tear out the sections we would need for our trip. First off, I had bought the paper version which meant I had paid for research etc for the content of the paper version. So there should have been a discount for buying the kindle version in addition to the paper version. There is no discount. The major issue is that you simply cannot use the eversion the way you use the paper version. Think of a 1200 page phonebook which is not in alphabetical order. There is no index in the eversion. No table of contents. I don't know about you but whenever I buy Lonely Planet, it is way before we book our trip. It is in the planning phase and I love to leaf through it, bend a few corners and then decide where/when we will go and what we must see. That's how you use the paper version. NOT SO FOR THE KINDLE VERSION. Without an index, you can bookmark a bunch of pages but that only gives you a list of bookmarks with no easy way to know which is which. It is not like you could put your text on a 'post-it' for easy reference. there is no possible way to search either.<br /><br />Was it of some use? Barely. I did know the sections of the paper version inside out and as I have pretty much a photographic memory, I was able to more or less use the kindle version with some level of competence, most of the time. Another silly issue is the maps which are throughout the e-book lack detail. Yes, they have the same (lack of) detail the maps in the paper version do but there is no excuse for not seeing more detail when you zoom in. Useless! And it could be better.<br /><br />In summary, think of a phonebook that is not in alphabetical order. If you remember where my name is, you could find it. Otherwise, you don't have a hope. It is a very poor effort. Most of these problems would disappear with something as simple as an index and the ability to search by keywords.
B001YXVOU2|5.0|I first heard this album in 1970, while visiting a friend in N.Y.C.. Just as we sat down to check out this new record, a massive explosion rocked the whole building we were in, which turned out to be an oil refinery miles away. I don't know if this had anything to do with my first impressions, but I found a new voice that I had never heard before from Dylan, one that left me with a new respect for this timeless artist, whom I first heard in 1962, as a child, and whose influence had a great deal to do with my own intellectual development. This is one album with no politics or agendas to muddle the great tunes and a country influence that seems totally natural. This is a must for real fans.
B00915G6YE|5.0|I, like many, had very low expectations from the steaming pile of doo that was season 6, and I was pleasantly surprised by season 7!  There is a lot more character development for Dexter as well as some nice twists as always.  Definitely get this if you were disappointed in season 6, it gives back hope to where the story of Dexter is going!
B006LSZECO|5.0|What a great read!! I couldn't put this book down, the end of every chapter left you wanting to read more!
B004X75RK4|5.0|They could not have picked better actors for all the characters in this movie. I loved every moment of the movie. Some of my most favorite actors to mention a few, Ryan Reynolds, Sandra Bullock, Betty White only to mention a few. I loved the dog, it was adorable. Great story line and very believable, I have had a few demanding bosses, not to this extent but where they think you owe them even after your off the clock.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|I thought this would not be very good but it turned out to be pretty good.<br />Bruce Willis does what Bruce Willis is known for but kinda different so it made me laugh some.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is so unique.  3D effects are so wonderful.  I am looking forward to the next one.  Just can't wait!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Exciting and challenging game. I like the fact that even if the guard catches the surfer the game always starts over with a new subway layout. That way you don't get bored.
0553386794|5.0|I put off reading this series because I thought it was just another dungeon and dragon kind of series.  I haven't seen the show because I don't have Starz, but I stopped and read the prologue of book 1 and I was hooked! I bought the set of four in paperback and have pre-ordered book 5 in paperback (due out in october) but think I will probably find the hardcover and read it before October 15th.  The way GRRM writes is amazing, I had no idea of what I was missing.  His words are that of a true artist.  This series of books is an absolute page turner. I have to force myself to put it down at midnight so I can get some sleep before the alarm goes off at 5:30 in the morning
B00B23O96A|5.0|have always liked clapton style had a chance to see him in concert was my very first concert ever and i am sixty years of age  old sock is classic and love the song i still get the blues for you
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I spent several days with it. Kept forgetting locations; the hint button for locations is great!  Storyline is ok; never did get to see who or what was possessing the characters. Of course it didn't matter. Fun game!
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This was an amazing story of a near death experience, to True Healing!<br /><br />This Author takes you with her for the experience!
B00129H7VS|5.0|I received this Band of Brothers disc set for Christmas (bought it for my parents to give me as a present), and it came quickly and well packed. The complete set has many 1 hour episodes you can watch easily, and the picture and sound quality are incredibly good.<br /><br />I'm a Christian and am thankful for this incredibly well-acted and produced series. It depicts, however, many scenes that I'm sure were true to life in the war, including a good bit of strong profanity in parts as well as brief nudity in one scene in a latter episode. The development of characters is very creatively done, and I was drawn in to sympathize with these guys who often lost buddies that they fought beside. Just know that there are parts of the episodes that are not suitable for kids.<br /><br />The sacrifice of our armed servicemen is so well portrayed here that it gave me an even greater sense of appreciation for their gift to our country.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|The best way that I can define this movie is by saying it has a very touching story and will keep you engaged from beginning to end. Great performances by the actors and a great emotinal drama!
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|As you requested here is my review of my recent purchases.  This is both movies and a toy for my gandson.
B004QKNXIQ|4.0|My daughter loves this movie and it's a nice family time that everyone can enjoy together. I definitely recommend it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I did not know if i would have to buy a kindle too, but it works just like my soninlaws kindle. I love it.
B00932A4XE|3.0|Nothing new but not bad either. Some old chick flick type of movie. Fun to watch with your wife. I'd still recommend it.
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|Hi my girls have been waiting to see this and they love it and watch it all the time Sue
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|It's an option if you don't have anything else to do and it's rainy outside. Not much to say about this movie. I guess by saying that Seth MacFarlane is part of it says it all.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I love spirited away! It's a cute, magical story. I love all the characters like the soot spirits, chihiro, and of course haku. The music is beautiful too. I like the Japanese version and the dubbed version. I feel they always do a good job picking the actors to do the voice overs for the dubbed version.
B0074ALZ7Q|5.0|I first read Daphne duMaurier's \\"Rebecca\\" as a teenager: the first real grown-up \\"thriller\\" in my life. I must have re-read it at least 20 times over the last 30 years, and have never tired of it. What an evergreen work of genius!
B00C1BV9Z6|5.0|Love this movie. It was great to watch it again. It still put me on the edge of my seat.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I'm not big on ho games, but I really enjoyed this one! Nice story to it as well. Enjoy ;) I found the ho&quot;s easy to navigate. Will play again but on harder phase.
0307887448|5.0|Very well written and it holds your attention through the whole thing. I enjoyed every aspect of it and will be checking out Clien's other works.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Great selection of music. I love the cloud storage also that comes with the app.<br />I would recommend this app.
0345494997|5.0|My wife cant put it down, Some people text in the car, if it's good enough she will try and read in the car despite a headache.. ( Oh no, thats me...<br />Anyway she likes the book!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This game is highly evolved for pad devices, having a great time building my swordmaster. Very simple format, so it is perfect for anyone to play so long as you don't mind blood and gore
6305428352|4.0|This is another favorite time piece from back in the day when schools and classrooms felt like school--something redeeming to feel the simplicity of this era.  If you are a fan of music, the story builds around the fervor of Mr. Holland to compose music, and to teach this classroom orchestra to play well.  The struggles and trials of Mr. Holland's passion of music, his dedication to teach, his little baby who grows (don't want to spoil here) with particular challenges, and his retirement surprise.  A delightful ending that will tug your heart.  In the end, Mr. Holland was not just valued as a teacher, but a TEACHER.  These types are hard to find these days.  A nice family evening.  It is a lengthy two bowl popcorn evening.  Enjoy this one.
B0026QC0YU|3.0|Every Moment there is no Dialogue...Cinematic genius! But between Dugray Scott' over emphasis of his Scottish accent and the over use of Pithy one liners, that predates twitter. I would almost prefer watching this with the volume off, but then you lose the soundtrack.
0061900656|5.0|Wonderful book! Written with such sensitivity! Made our little Charlie proud to be a big brother. The illustrations are so relatable!
B00BSBT8M6|2.0|I was disappointed by the movie.  There was too much that was just not realistic and the way it was done was just, well, cheesy.  The adult actor paying Pi was very good.  Overall, not thrilled.
B005VOXQFQ|5.0|We kept this guy in the potted bamboo through summer and winter and it was fine. It often went to the toddler pool and down the slide. It's purpose was to be moved around for the GK's to find in the yard hide n seek fashion. Very realistic down to the dark pads on its feet. Loved the panda's we saw at the San Diego Zoo. Perfect match.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|ive been using this app every day for over a year now and its great! it lets me set lots of alarms for different days of the week, etc.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|What can I say, I love music! It doesn't matter who sings it, just as long as it sounds good to me! I heard this song on the radio and found myself tapping my feet and bobbing my head to it, & once I found out who it was, I purchase it ! LOL Great song.
0345528581|5.0|This is one of the best books I have seen on bodyweight workouts.  The author shows you alot of exercises you can do.  Then the author lays out a plan for you to follow.  You can also create your own plan if you desire.  This is a very good book and if you like body weight workouts I would give it a try.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|MR. ALBOM ALWAYS MAKES YOU THINK ABOUT HOW THE HERE AND NOW IS SO IMPORTANT.  A VERY INTERESTING READ AND A GREAT DISCUSSION FOR A BOOK CLUB.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|For a tablet game, the graphics are excellent.  The controls are simple and easy to use. The game play is challenging enough to encourage replaying.
B000AO4NJA|5.0|My man, Sam. One of a kind. the golden voice of an angel. God gives this sort of talent to few.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Just purchased for my kindle. Great color. Tiles are easy to see. Having played mahjong on my computer the kindle edition is better.
B003O86FMW|1.0|The book wasn't that good because I didn't read the second one. If I could read the second one and link up what the third book is l would give this one a five star rating.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|A fast paced fun read that is everything you want in a good romance. I got wrapped up in the characters and sincerely had to tear myself away from the book at times.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|Daft Punk as it's best. I like the combination of Daft Punk and Pharrell Williams. I hope the album will be as good as the single Get Lucky.
B006M4F67A|3.0|It works fine for me. It's just not what I expect from a Mahjong game. It's annoying that I can't unselect a tile without selecting another. And this game does not use a standard tile set - each layout can have any number of pairs of the same tile, instead of 2 pairs each. Makes this play more like a hidden object game; there's no longer strategy involved, just observation.
B0061QD82E|5.0|Lady and the Tramp is such a lovely Disney movie. For me it's a classic like The Lion King or Cinderella. It's so calming to watch this movie and listen to the great background music.
B0085TJUGI|5.0|Regardless of your beliefs this is an outstanding human interest work of art written from the heart.  Doctors at the hospital had given Anita just hours to live when she arrived at the hospital that morning, unable to move as a result of the cancer that had ravaged her body for over three years.<br /><br />The author takes us on a journey from physical death to life's jubilation.  If you have lost someone dear or even just ponder the mysteries of life, you will find this an awesome read!
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This game is cool it is o pen world and fun and more updates keep the game fun!<br />Best kindle game ever!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app is the best note taker app ever it helps you organize your notes into notebooks. So I recommend it to everyone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It addicting and fun I would highly suggest the game I play it every day I can it is a blas[[ASIN:B009UX2YAC Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition)]]t
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The updates are awesome, first it was new York then it was Rio then Rome then Sindy and now it's tokeo
B0079HLDCQ|5.0|Nice to see Baldacci back to his best .. some of his previous novels recently have been a bit off...... this one is an excellent read with lots of twists and turns... but believable....well written.... keeps you reading hard to the last word on the last page ... story line is topical and involved enough to keep the brain wanting to see ahead ... if the brain could do that
B000P0J0EW|5.0|this is a must see movie it is so real. the way prison life for the inmates it is a great movie to see if you have some one in your life that is in prison you can see what it is like
B003G4W49C|5.0|Loved this book! My boyfriend recommended it to me. Must read for everyone! People can definitely relate to Ender and his  struggles.
0385361661|1.0|I have read several Sophie Kinsella novels,  read reviews for this and decided to plunk down the $12.99 for the Kindle edition. Big mistake. None of the characters are likable, not even the child. I would further suggest that none of the secondary or background characters are nice either(Michelle and Matt?) Although the make-up artist Jo, at career day did seem genuine for her three paragraph cameo.  I read every word since I paid so much for this mess, maybe if you shuffle the words randomly, something better would appear. It couldn't get worse.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|five seasons on netflix but the season 6 final season wasn't, so i had to get it! there was no question, had to know how it ends!
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Easy read, somewhat pleasurable but enlightening at the same time.  Good intro for people getting into DevOps.  Provides a window into life in IT Ops
B0071XO8RA|5.0|With a brand new kindle in hand, decided to try some of the free stories.  Wool grabbed me from the first story and I purchased the entire series.  Very well written, great concept, I'm addicted.  After finishing, I found his next series about the Silo and purchased it immediately.  Mr. Howey is a magician with words, characters and suspense, my new hero!
B000IDEORY|4.0|Its a great film.  Romance and drama.  It teaches that money cannot buy happiness nor determine your worth, that who you are comes from the inside.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Fast download, quick to pull up and gives me lots of options for calculating.  Would recommend it for a quick calculator app.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It's a fun game and habit forming.  It's a good way to pass the time when or spending down time after a long day of work.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I had forgotten how charming these adventures were to read!We are taking grandchildren to Hannibal, MO this summer, so reading this and Huck Finn's adventures are the best preparation.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I really like playing solitaire at night just before bed because it helps me to unwind from the day.  Sometimes when I am alone I play just to enjoy myself.
B001NHNG64|4.0|The writing is good but there is too much about the side action and not enough Jack Reacher.  The story concerns an FBI agent (Holly) and a militia group in Montana.  Reacher spends more time as a prisoner than anything else but wins out in the end.<br /><br />Richard Ruppel
B00B6QXN56|5.0|This is a unique concert for Bonamassa played with many different guitars. On his website is a background video about putting together the concert. Every great musical venue has its own acoustics. The Vienna Opera House is a special showcase for the wonderful guitarist Bonamassa is. Not to be missed.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|And I've been so glad I did.  Sharp Objects does not disappoint with a haunted female lead character, plot twists, and a fascinating plot.  Enjoy!
B00AEFY66U|5.0|This is by far one of the better versions of the book... but then again, ANYTHING with Robert Redford in it will score big with me.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|[[ASIN:B0083Q04IQ Kindle Fire 7\\", LCD Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers]]The product is a good one. Some times its slow. But overall is nice.
B009JBZH54|5.0|My nephew is a huge fan and couldn't not wait for the series to come out in BluRay. It's a keeper!
B0000046KM|5.0|The lyrics to the title song, Here's to Life, sound astonishing perfect for this man's ears and heart after 75 years of life - I told my sons, play this one at my funeral. The rest of the CD is terrific and Shirley Horn has to be the most underated performer on the planet. Such heart, such soul and the voice to communicate it all. Cannot miss with this one.
B0061PEAUY|2.0|I watch Bones every week and enjoy.  Thought the book would be an enjoyable read.  Too many characters,  loose<br />plot,  unnecessary info about gold mines.  Temperance has grown daughter (Kate), not Christine like in show.  Ex  husband's name is Pete (?) and FBI man is Ryan.  Wish book was more like show.  Will not be purchasing other books by author for fear of mundane.  Read it to the end in case it got good.
B009JZVT70|5.0|My family and I absolutely love the way the fairy tales are intertwined with modern day life. All of us love it. My college age children (4 of them ) absolutely demand we watch it! Great stuff for everyone in the family!!
B005K17RU0|1.0|Up grade stinks.  The new graphics are overdone and you can't see the entire radar screen with the toolbar on the top.  Bring back the old version! Keep it simple
B008YKGQR4|2.0|This app uses so much memory that I bought another SD card larger and it still was quite enough for alll the things I needed on my phone
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Hope the next one comes out soon! I suggest these to anyone who likes politics and fantasy. I still need three more words !
B00007KWHG|5.0|After seeing JERSEY BOYS in New York, this is &#34;the&#34; collection to own, hard to believe how many hit songs they had that we all know and love, i keep it in my car and play it all the time during my 2 hour commute in TEXAS... the songs are all remastered and sound great on a fantastic sound system or great car sound system....enjoy
B009R5GR1K|5.0|I like all the features of this dictionary, it's easy to use, and stimulates the mind. I will be recommending it to everyone!
B0010SKUYM|4.0|Good book told from first person narrative. The hero is a standard plot, but the author definitely is more poetic in his descriptions and weaving the narrative.
B003PGNBNY|5.0|Camp Rock 2 is so much better than the first one, and the music is just awesome. My husband and I find ourselves singing the songs all the time and the kids love to sing along during the movie.
B000SEGMAU|3.0|I really hate autobiographies they just don't catch my interest the only one to do that was Chinese Cinderella. Now that's a good book.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This game is packed with all sorts of really cool things and unique ideas.  While it's definitely geared more towards pay to win, it's not so ridiculously weighted towards purchasing in game content that it makes it unplayable for po folk like me.  And really, Gameloft's free to play pay to win is where most games are headed.<br /><br />They put out some really great titles and for me(New to tablets and Android) this is one of my favorites. I'm not super far into the game but far enough to say give it a whirl it's pretty amazing.
B00AKKTDJY|3.0|It does what it advertises. Bought it for my daughter but it is not my cup of tea. Dpends on taste.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Walking Dead is one of my favorite shows on TV right now. Not just mindless zombie, killing and death, but the show touches of the hypothetical side and doesn't throw controversial decisions made by the characters in your face. Makes for great conversations and I highly recommend watching!!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this game so much I play it everyday my id is Bradybistro so please add me I'm level 23 almost level 24 its awesome
B0094WK9GU|5.0|My son and I both love it!! Glad I paid a few extra dollars for the deluxe version, totally worth it!!
1400069807|5.0|As a nutrition educator, I was eager to read Salt Sugar Fat.  At first, I felt it was too in depth about food product development, but then I became fascinated by just how incredibly calculated the work of the food industry is.  Their &#34;recipes&#34; and the insidious marketing are blatantly about getting us addicted/satisfying their shareholders.  Michael Moss writes for the layperson and anyone interested in changing the food system in this country should read this book. Until our government stops supporting the food industry, the obesity epidemic/health crisis in this country is only going to get worse. Much worse.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|Our book club was divided but all agreed that it was interesting and well written. Some didn't like<br />the length but our discussion was one of the best we have had.<br />Roberta
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|As a child of the 70's and 80's, this was a fun romp down memory lane thinking of all the things we watched, listened to, played, read or did at that time. Very clever weaving it all together into a virtual reality game as well as adding the suspense of what will happen to the characters as they move forward.  The potential is there that this could have been much longer, so the restraint is appreciated, but only if it means a sequel is forthcoming. Well done! I look forward to more!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't wait to read this book the second in the trilogy. I feel that it is a very fast read
B003O86FMW|5.0|Hard to put this one down.<br />Exciting read from start to finish.<br />I would highly recommend this book to everyone!
0399247459|5.0|This is the classic tale, but a huge (8x11?) size, yet still a thick, heavy duty board book. We had party guests sign it as a keepsake.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This was one of those books I would not have chosen, my granddaughter recommended it and I am very glad she did. The style and language of the story were different and for me, interesting. I would like to encourage anyone to experience this storytelling.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is the best tool of procrastination ever! Easy to navigate and use. You won't go wrong with this app
1594484805|4.0|My daughter had to read this for English. She liked the concept that people are better motivated by intrinsic (e.g. good feelings) rewards than by outward (e.g. money or notoriety) rewards.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|My husband and I thoroughly enjoy his books. His books are always on our wish list. We would highly recommend.
1609611543|5.0|Davis is a cardiovascular specialist who struggled with weight, high cholesterol and tri-glycerides, and impending type II diabetes, et al... the most common health woes of our society. In studying the health trends of US citizens in the past 50 years, he found that the rise of obesity, heart disease, and type II diabetes has gone in tandem with: 1. the hybridization and genetic modification of food staples, especially wheat; 2. AMA, AHA and USDA's rigid endorsement of the food pyramid and the low-fat-high-carbohydrate diet, which seems to be killing Americans. The modifications to wheat and corn have gone on largely unchecked as to effect on and with little regard for the health of those who consume it. Davis reveals the horrors of Frankenstein wheat that now bears so little resemblance to its ancestors that it is no wonder that it is not good for us, especially in the massive quantities that Americans are consuming it, at the urging of health professionals. Did you know that whole-grain wheat leads the glycemic index of foods that raise your blood sugar? Even more than refined wheat (white flour) and table sugar! Time to stop blindly following the establishment in regard to our diets.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I am 40 and enjoy this as well as my preteens and 3 yr old daughter.  I would recommend it.
0307474259|4.0|Taubes has reviewed decades of studies that should have (but didn't) vindicated the nutritional dogma spouted by the AMA, USDA, AHA, etc. for nearly 40 years now. Many scientists or health professionals couldn't accept the actual results of these studies. Flummoxed, but unable to abandon the (logical, though flawed and scientifically unsupported) &#34;law of thermodynamics&#34; as applied to human metabolism, they merely ignored the studies and clung ever tighter to old dogma. Would it interest you to know that there has never been a scientific study that supports and confirms the calories-in/calories-burned solely determines weight (bodyfat)? Read this book. Note: the first 2/3s of this book may seem repetitive and too clinical, but the author has carefully reviewed and researched over a century of dietary and nutritional writings and clinical studies to provide ample data to prove his point that not all calories are the same. The quality and content of food matters so much more than the simplified math of thermodynamics.
1616550414|5.0|I loved this book a lot. I learned a lot of new things about the whole Zelda series. Every Zelda fan needs one.
0811879542|5.0|As simple book illustration and wording gives kids instructions on where to press.  When you turn the page the child's &#34;actions&#34; have caused something special.  Great alternative to a tablet, this book is very interactive.
B0091REZMW|4.0|having fun. there is a lot to do. and it keeps you busy. I like the graphics. I also like the characters.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game. They are always adding more rooms to keep it interesting. I play bingo blitz everyday. A lot of fun.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|grandsons love it. Free game and they seem to enjoy it very much. Please have more free games. love it
B007N5YIUS|5.0|If you know anything about Angry Birds, this is a great game. Really fun and the sound effects are perfect. Would highly recommend to all. Get it and start to enjoy a nice game!
B004G8QTS4|3.0|I like the characters but Dawn Patrol was better.  I hope he keeps writing about these characters though.  The premise is great.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Great little game. Fun and will keep you busy for HOURS!!<br />Can't go wrong and you will be playing a lot longer than you thought you will. Fun for everyone.<br />Recommend to anyone.
B009FZHYKU|2.0|Season 3... they were just stuck in a jail. It seemed like a smart idea but it makes for a dull story. Any imo most of the characters are nuts... Rick and the mayor.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I have all the Angry Bird games and they are all great!! You can't go wrong with anyone of them. Start downloading this and sit back to enjoy a super nice game. Would recommend this to all.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|Love this app!! I'm usually really serious about editing but this is fun to do when you want to when I'm on the road and don't have awhile lot to do.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Just like all the Angry Bird games, this is a fun game to keep you busy at times when you have time to kill. You won't get bored, because it is so much fun to play. Highly recommend this to anyone who whats to play a really fun game. Her come the birds!! Enjoy.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|great movie great price if you like broadway plays then you will love this its just like being there terriffic
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|You never know when you'll need a calculator and when you do, you'll be glad you have this one. Simple and easy to use. Comes in handle at times and gives you all you need.<br />Would recommend it!
B009NG1Q96|3.0|and then I read it and was disappointed... I feel like the story line fell flat and nothing really major happened. I probably will still read The One and hope that book will be better.
B0086700CM|5.0|I discovered this game on the app store. Once I downloaded it, I was hooked. Outstanding to play. Challenging and fun all at the same time. Would recommend to anyone. Enjoy!!
B006Y5H74W|5.0|I love the songs and characters... If you like musicals your will like this show. So sad this show got cancelled.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|Very quick and easy to use with<br />editing capabilities including a writer . Framing and presentation of .pdf's is great .<br />Excellent !
0802473156|5.0|This book has changed my understanding of relationships, marriage, and love.  I wish had read this every 6 months for the past 18 years.  By applying the principles described in this book, I believe that my marriage could have been saved before it was ever in jeopardy!
B007M45PMU|5.0|I love this album.  Every song (except one) is gold.  I've had it for about a year now (since it first came out) and I'm not sick of it at all.  It's not often that I like the whole album from any band.  Most of the time it's a mixed bag, so I was pretty bowled over when I first discovered these guys.  If you have a taste for well-crafted song writing you won't be disappointed.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|I read this book for business/marketing information, and was not disappointed, but beyond that it  helped me understand - and start thinking about changing- some of my own habits for the better.<br /><br />The segments on the gambler as well as Target Store's market research were fascinating and chilling at the same time... Note to the people out there who are worried about Big Brother.  He is here.  He is NOT the government.  He is corporate America.
B004S5FW1U|5.0|Great story - a little different from the screen play - and glad they changed the father's attitude to the main male character in the movie.  Even with the differences the book is a great read.
1608871452|5.0|This book is a great buy for true Supernatural fans. Detailed photos and explanations of themes,looks behind the scenes - everything a true fan would enjoy. Great purchase!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love how easy this version is to use. Loads quickly and never freezes or lags. I'm on it whenever I have down time and wifi.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Kvothe is arrogant and self conscious at the same time...Fantastic<br /> Book,can't wait fir more Chronicles-...for  once I haven't figured  out an ending
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|What a great man and example to so many, never give up.  Keep trusting and fighting for what you believe in.
B00AZ3027I|5.0|A classic movie from Disney. My son can watch it in the iPad. It is great! I am glad that I bought this movie.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I passed over this free book so many times thinking it would be another corny unbelievable story.  I was so wrong.  Delightful is the only way I can describe it.  I'm hoping for more from this author.
B00AEFXESQ|5.0|I could on and on and on about this and that but it wouldn't make a damn bit of difference because this is a masterpieces of film making.  Not since \\"Whose Afraid of Virgina Woolf\\" has a movie laid bare the soul to the bones of a human being.  There is nothing missed concerning the human condition.  It's as relevant today as it was in 1998.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|I am so glad I discovered the TED lectures. It can open new worlds  through the knowledge of those people who share their expertise with the rest of us. From science to relationships, it never disappoints. It makes your brain go, &#34;Wow!&#34;
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The Room looks great, sounds great, and is a lot of fun. The puzzles are really well put together, not painfully challenging but interesting. I like that the game is put together with a plot that is engaging, I only wish it was longer, after playing this through I can't wait for the next installment of this title and more games from this publisher.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I love this book. It was great reading about the adventure in Mexico and how we are designed to run. Putting it all together made for a great story.
B008J05EL8|2.0|I downloaded this because I thought it would help me to use an audio Bible that I had downloaded from scourby.com. Since I have been unable to use the Bible, I have no need of this app as far as I know. Wish I had my money back.
B000FA5STS|5.0|Great read, riveting and suspenseful. This is another great read--although the technology used in the plot is based on early to late 1990s computer Systems.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Wow, what a great book... I really got Into the characters and felt like I was in the story! Everyone buy this book I absolutely loved it!!!!
B000FBJF6Y|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much. It is a cheerful story and I enjoyed learning about Botswana in the process. Mma Romatswa reveals observations about human nature throughout the stories which in some cases reveal a different viewpoint that I had not considered before.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|IIt was amazing minus the ending. But it was one of the scariest movies I've watched n a while. all n all id watch it again.
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|Not at all impressed with it. Love the other games but just didn't like it. There aren't enough steps. Would not consider buying it.

B0015DROBO|5.0|Lake some intense books you can really get into. Lots of tense moments and great read would recommend this book
B006VFLIYK|4.0|the book was great, suprise ending cant wait to read THe Hit if its as good as The innocent. should keep me busy for a while.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Our country is being  &#34;dumbed&#34; down and is not paying attention to anything that is going on. We need to read this book to understand WHY we have ll been duped and sold a bill of goods on all this PC junk we are cow-towing to, which is crap. So many Americans walk along, don't knowing, don't caring about anything, except what they have going on in their lives. They don't care about our country, they don't care about our men and women who are serving this country, they could care less if this whole country goes to Hell, and it is headed in that direction.  Wake up, America! Read this book and see what a puppet you have become, see how dumb you are, and do something about it!
B001NLKT60|5.0|The book &#34;The Girl with the dragon Tattoo&#34; was fantastic.  The author wrote so well that I flew through the book and was left wanting more.  The story did not feel as if it was over, I wanted to know what happened to her with concerns of what happened to her brother and her father.  And lo and behold the next two book finished her story, but I really wish the author could have written more I loved his style and detail.
B000305ZS4|5.0|This is what started black metal and set the standard for the next 20 years. Few bands have made such an impact. Dissection. Watson .N maybe now Ghost for future darkness w a twist
B00C2VIA52|5.0|I have probably put in about 45-50 hrs and have only put in $5 to purchase a few rare cards.  It reminds me of a simpler vetsion of Magic the Gathering.  Very nice presentation.
0553801473|5.0|Love the book, love the series of books, love the HBO show!  Can't wait for the next book to come out.

B009329Y30|5.0|Zac Efron was perfectly cast for this part.  Read the book too and the movie is very well done & believable.  Great story & ending!
B005COO1X6|2.0|Was a little disappointed in the story line and sameness of Christine . I guess I was expecting to be entertained as I was when first reading The Stand- little weird how the monster car disappeared too -  maybe I wasn't in \\"short story\\" mode
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Just can not download to my kindle hd need help please send reply back with phone number so that I can talk with a rep.

B005TBN04S|3.0|I had heard some bad things about this, so I avoided it when it originally came out. Only saw it so I would be caught when when I see III. Turns out, it is pretty funny, although obviously pretty formulaic.
B007V4530A|5.0|Read the book, watch the ted presentations and practice.<br />I enjoy the book,  discover some ted presentations and get new ideas to improve my skills
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Well written even though the outcome is predictable.  It was very emotional.  I cried!  That<br />says a lot about the writer & the story.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Well done and not overdone.  I was concerned that Cruise wouldn't fit the role of Jack Reacher, but he pulled it off nicely.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Very well acted and very suspenseful! I realy loved it, The movie was so far fethed but so very well done.
B009NY43NY|3.0|It felt like the last episode of Seinfeld when they trotted everyone out , that was still alive, from every book in the series. I read it in 2 days and finished it so I wasn't awful , but not the best one for sure. I saw that it was rated 3 stars and thought \\"how could you read through all her books and only give this one 3 stars? you would have to be a fan to get this far in the series\\" believe me it was well deserved.If this was the 1st in the series I'm not sure I would read the rest.
B003G4W49C|5.0|amazing storyline mr. card has put together enjoyable all the way around if your a star wars fan here you go!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this site, and can be on several times a day. I find a lot of ideas, craft wise and recipes ideas.
B009PU2SX8|5.0|Gary Clark Jr.'s latest album Blak and Blu makes you realize everything that is right with the world. He delivers on musical capability and executes some moving and memorable songs. You Saved Me is perhaps my favorite on the album, and stands out among the rest. So good.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I try using this site every day. When I'm not at home to get on my desktop, I can use my Kindle!
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Really enjoy this game. Would look at others by this developer. Wish there were instructions about using bricks to rebuild city.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|I like knowing that I have this on my Kindle.  The reader helps to be able to open videos and to have clearer pictures.
B00CL6HGIK|2.0|When your hero is a murderer cop in the opening seen, there is only so far you can go. Everybody is pretty much a bad guy. Maybe that's just true to life. Then, somehow, the the cop that'll shoot you in cold blood becomes the sacrificial lamb? Really? The action you expect from Marky Mark, entertaining if there is nothing better to watch. Meh.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Another game that I can pass the time away! A puzzle that you need to take apart instead of putting together.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|the latest season of this show finds our hero facing more obstacles in his mission of killing more bad guys
B009RH9J7W|5.0|It has worked out so well to have this case. I should have had this earlier, it would have saved the the screen that cracked when I accidentally dropped it on the tile in my kitchen!
0307887448|5.0|Gloriously conceived and executed. Gamers will love, non-gamers will be amazed and everyone who came to age in the 80s will jump for joy.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|These guys are amazing!  Their music is superb! I am very fond of the cello and have a hard time finding just the right sound. Together with the amazing piano talent, these guys nail it.
B00CATSONE|5.0|This book was a lot of fun to read.  I never knew Tesla was responsible for so many inventions but the real message is about finding your own genius.  I enjoyed it so much it seemed I was done reading in minutes.  I highly recommend this book!
B004SUWR2C|5.0|Best game I ever bought better than the card game naw just kidding but a fun game to play on your kindle .
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|I was expecting a lot more out of the movie. Especially because I read the book before hand, they changed things that didn't really need changing. It wasnt really like the book at all and all I could focus on the whole time was the things they changed.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I really love these books. I have never read such great books.one more to go and the story will end, I am sad.
B000H30B2C|5.0|this films has me watching it time and again..Watts is beautiful and genuine in this film..the comedic parts were not over the top and the film stuck to the original storyline. jack black is terrific as the over obsessive director doing anything he can to get this film back to hollywood..the downside? this dvd came in TWO parts,so half way through you'll have to stop and put in the second dvd..love widescreen.
B00AF6B22E|4.0|There was a spiritual lesson in this story even though there was no need for nudity at beginning of film & too much cursing, your conscience will bother you to tell the whole truth & confession is good for the soul!
B008220C38|3.0|wished I had rented it first! LOL  the movie is a period piece which Knightley is best known for being in and the costumes are breathtaking. The way the film was presented took me by surprise..i'm not a music film fan nor a theatre fan and this was a collaboration of these two things and film..it looked to me as if it tried to emulate &#34;Romeo & Juliet&#34; starring DiCaprio and Danes in regards to the presentation of the film..not even close! but otherwise, it was tolerable.
B00B1E6FF8|3.0|too much cursing, even when a true story about Osabim Laden, there was too much foul language especially from a woman
B0000VD04M|5.0|you cant help but like the warped thinking of Ed Wood and no one BUT Depp could have played this part..Excellent film
B000N6U0EC|4.0|actor Wil Smith always is a good actor in good films with truth in a true story in real life
B005LAIIJY|5.0|if you don't like Tarentino or have never experienced any of this films, this is probably not for you..this is a typical film of his and it is as good as all his others..he has trademarked his style and no one can out do it. I love a director who loves the same kind of films i do
B00AHTYGRW|4.0|There was less violence & foul language, one of best pictures in real life, when hollywood is full of cursing
0071390111|5.0|purchased this to help with research papers, have the previous volumes. Good, but went on different track than I expected so didn't help as much as I hoped.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I think this was the best book yet I loved the suspense but I have to admit I wished there would of been move of the wedding and wedding night
B005LFQRTC|5.0|This show so captured my imagination in the 1970s, and still does, that it embarked me on my lifelong love of science and technology!<br /><br />Unlike other superheroes, Steven Austin was a mere mortal man, and the bionic limbs and eye that would not only save his life but make him \\"better, stronger, faster\\" than before was a technology that seemed possible!<br /><br />I remember, in my naivete as a 10-year-old kid, asking my dad if I could have the operation that Steve had, even though my limbs and organs functioned relatively perfectly, so that, in my then scrawny frame, I could have and enjoy those bionic powers, and defend myself against bigger kids who were picking on me in school.  Of course, my dad's reply was:  \\"It's just a TV show, Mike.  That technology doesn't really exist.\\"  It was so ironic to hear, on one of the supplemental disc's documentaries, that actor Lee Majors, who played the show's iconic hero, as well as members of the production team, get asked that same question all the time from amputees!<br /><br />Here we get all three ABC movies of the week, followed by all the season 1 episodes.  There's not much I can add to the other excellent reviews here, except to say that it's amusing to hear how the show's opening title montage and theme song went through a major overhaul from TV Movie 3 to Episode One of the series, when Executive Producer Harve Benett, who would later produce many of the Star Trek movies, took over, and felt, as I did, that the series needed a new theme song.<br /><br />With all due credit to Glenn Larson, who would go on to conceive and produce his \\"little\\" space epic called Battlestar Galactica, and who here, in addition to co-producing these movies, wrote the music and lyrics for this song, kind of a '60s-era soul song, simply called \\"Six Million Dollar Man\\", that has Dusty Springfield singing \\"He's the MAAAAAN! with backup singers singing 'The Six Million Dollar MAAAAAN!'  Catch him if you can, beat him if you can, love him if you CAAAAN...\\", sorry, Glenn...this song HAD to go.  Apparently, Larson felt that his song would help cement Lee Majors as a sex symbol, a sex MACHINE, a sex GOD, for the ladies, and it did, but then-new producer Harve Bennett and the execs at ABC rightly felt, as I do, that, since Steve was in the military, the series needed more of a militaristic sound.  Thank God the prevailing theme song was scrapped and was replaced, like Steve's human parts, with the more familiar militaristic drum and percussion-driven theme song, ingeniously composed by Oliver Nelson, who scored TV's Ironside, as well as multiple other shows and movies, that we have now grown to know and love.<br /><br />It's also interesting to note that the iconic sound-effects, of the bionic arm and legs functioning (\\"chchchchch\\"), as well as the impact sound whenever Steve's bionic limbs connect with another object (\\"boompapapapapa\\"), are almost totally absent in Season 1!  The bionic eye begins to make its telltale mid-range pulsing noise (\\"boopoopoopoo\\") about halfway through the season.  John Saxon, who would play a robot in the memorable episode, Day of the Robot, who squares off against Steve Austin in hand-to-hand combat, has the honor of being the show's first actor to enjoy having his actions \\"scored\\" by the show's first bionic sound-effect.  It wouldn't be until Season 2 when producers and ABC execs pulled out all the stops and courageously began using those legendary sound-effects whenever Steve bursts into bionic mode and performs a bionic deed.<br /><br />Great show!  Great set!  I particularly enjoyed getting to know the great Harve Bennett, in his extensive behind-the-scenes interview on the bonus disc, as he explains, in great detail, why he made several creative decisions, mainly to take the show away from pure sci-fi and make Steve less of a robot and more human.  This was the right decision.<br /><br />The rich characterizations and satisfying interrelationships between characters, bionic man Steve, OSI chief administrator and mission mastermind Oscar Goldman (played with great warmth and intelligence by Richard Anderson) and OSI scientist who developed and maintains Steve's bionic technology, Dr. Rudy Wells (who would be played by 3 actors) formed a strong bond of love and loyal, devoted family, a family that we welcomed into our own families, a family that we are now able to become embroiled in whenever we fire up our DVD players, a family that continues to endure.<br /><br />Considering the source material, ABC and MCA/Universal's original master air tapes (going back to the 35mm negatives, if they exist, would yield an even better, stronger look...perhaps, if there's ever a blu-ray release...), the remastered transfers look terrific, even better than I remember this show looking when it first aired on ABC!<br /><br />Plug in, charge up those bionic power cells, and enjoy.
B0044C5SCU|4.0|Once again they want me to write a review of what I liked and disliked about the show. I'm a poor writer, so you should just go off the number of stars I gave .
B002L6I9Z4|3.0|The camera looks ok for a 6 year old kid but the screen it's too small.<br />It really look like a toy.<br />And it's easy to use it. It's ok for a kid.
B007MC8YLQ|3.0|My beef is how slow it plays on the Kindle Fire 4G, even when it is connected to WiFi or the wireless is off.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I bought this game for my grandson. This game is so much fun. He's played it for 2 days. It's addictive!
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Once I started I couldn't stop reading. This book had so many twist and turns to it that it was fun to read.
B0031Y9DCS|5.0|Read this book on the suggestion of a friend who was a helicopter pilot in Viet Nam and served with the author. It is a definitely frank first hand account of this time in our nation's history. Some things were hard to read but it gave me great insight into why my friends who served in Viet Nam never have wanted to talk about the experience.
193700788X|5.0|Though there was some filler mixed in to this book, over all it was a fine read.  While there are some readers that have complained about the book and its ending, it ended the way I always thought it would.  Getting to know Sookie over the years the ending made sense when you consider all the things she values.  I appreciate the authors attempt to wrap up each characters story line.  Nothing was left to make you wonder what happened with so and so.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Wonderful young adult fiction: moving and funny, and a page turner. It is a very quick read too!  Get it.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|It's a great game, easy to play, fantastic graphics, my son loves Iron Man, loves the game. He plays it a lot.
B005CMSDLE|5.0|i love this movie but it is truly sad and a bit disturbing...acting was phenomenal...story was great although it seems there was far more there than was portrayed...
B006OOHYIC|4.0|Really liked the first one. This one seems equally as fun.  Haven't played a whole lot yet, but I'm sure it will save me from hours of flight induced boredom.
B004XANKVO|5.0|This bag is what I was expecting, durable excellent zippers construction, not so many packets but enough, beautiful color, and spacious. The only piece I missed about this bag is the key holder which is normal in any bag these days.
B000FBJFSC|4.0|This author show how great an impact real poverty has on people's minds, lifestyles, and outlook on life.  It shows how difficult it is to rise above it.
B000WPAG1Q|5.0|Hi, i bought this a long timne ago......love Christina, great Concert. I play the DVD on my laptop and DVD player, but now i have a Bluray player and it can not read the disc, but it read others discs, can anyone help me with that??
B00514HDNW|4.0|So enjoyed this read. Didn't think I would, not my usual genre. Once I got into it I had trouble putting it down and was sad to see it end. The kind of story that leaves it open for debate as to what you would do in the same situation. I would recommend this book to anyone and for any book club. If you've seen the movies, forget them, this is so much better.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I like it.  I think it keeps you interested in the game.  I wouldn't change a thing about.<br /><br /> the game.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I find this easy to play. Does not require spending cash or give you slow progress. I really hope that you continue to add to this.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|I absolutely love the television adaption of literature's most cultured serial killer. Hannibal features excellent actors who portray their roles perfectly, haunting and gruesome murders that are also entirely creative, and a plot that leaves viewers hungry for more at the end of each episode.
B0048IMZMG|5.0|I have enjoyed this CD tremendously. I'm an older adult, but I like it just the same. I recommend downloads to everyone.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This is a very good and fun game I love it. This must of taken forever to make. It is almost good enough to be a console game but of course there are some bugs and that is normal.<br /><br />There is a good story and I like it. Great campaign.<br />Complaints:I think the guns are way to expensive. It takes a while to get new ones. Also why do you need to buy new classes/loadouts? That is annoying.<br /><br />Complements: I love being able to by so many attachments it is awesome. Sincerely, kindle user.
B000LX00RY|5.0|I had wanted to see this movie when it was in the theatre, but missed it, so was thrilled to download and watch in my home. This movie is my first downloaded movie, but I recommend it to anyone. Instant access is excellent!
B008ROGQAE|4.0|Very enjoyable older show love Yul Brynner's acting love his movies like Magnificent seven and all his other movies wish you had them.
B0091THRCU|5.0|Great case in my opinion,, good quality leather, however, as everyone has noted tight at the beginning, tough pulling out<br />my iphone. But after several months of use, the leather has soften and its easier to pull out the phone. I guess that's typical<br />with leather when its new.
B004I8WD7S|3.0|Case is excellent and good value.  Screen protector not good... kept coming off and replaced after a few weels with another brand.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|My heading says it all, loved this season, not expecting the ending, but real shocker!<br />I cant wait for next season to start.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|The cable confirms my conclusion that the real problem is with the Kindle Fire.  Prior to replacing the cable, the Kindle would not charge.  The cable makes it possible to charge the Kindle (for which I am very grateful), but I must make sure the cable is in a particular position (after inserting the cable, I prop it up about three inches to assure contact).  I am, indeed, pleased with the cable, for it means my one and one half year old Kindle still works--for how long, who knows?
B00AQL8VU4|3.0|I downloaded this shopping cart app to my 7&#34; tablet hoping I could download various apps directly from this app to my tablet.  However, this is not the case.  Once you click on an app your interested in, you are directed to download the amazon appstore before you actually can download.  Some apps I see on this shopping app are not available at the amazon appstore.
B004EPYZZI|5.0|Movie in great condition. No problems. It was a gift for part of my husband's Christmas. I do the majority of my shopping for him from his Amazon wish list.

0385349831|4.0|\\"They can destroy the city, but they can't destroy everything the city has taught us.\\"<br /><br />It's 1099, and the city of Jerusalem has been given a choice: to abandon the city or fight to the death. Jews, Muslims, and Christians are assembled throughout various quarters of a city heretofore known for its tolerance and peace. But judging from the enemy's movements, tomorrow the invaders will breach the city walls, and the crowd forming within grows anxious and wary. Instead of preparing them for battle or discussing how to negotiate peace, a mysterious Greek shoemaker known only as the Copt begins to speak, calming fears and responding to the many questions posed by the crowd. His thoughts on solitude, defeat, change, hope, success, elegance, and loyalty are surprisingly enlightening and wise, confirming that words may be the most powerful weapons of all.<br /><br />The latest book from international bestselling author Paulo Coelho sounds epic, doesn't it? I've been meaning to read The Alchemist, his most popular title, for quite some time, but as tends to happen, the ubiquity and the recommendations from everyone-and-their-dog turned me off. Now that a few years have passed and that feeling has worn off, I was happy to accept a review query for his novel releasing this month, Manuscript Found in Accra. This year I've resolved to vary my reading, mainly along the lines of returning to genres I read before I started blogging that have been forgotten in the unending onslaught of review copies, book club reads, and blogger and author recommendations. While I'll never be ashamed of my growing obsession with genre novels and YA fiction, the attraction to spiritual, philosophical, and literary fiction will always be there, and this year I'm granting myself the time to read more contemplative books.<br /><br />Manuscript Found in Accra was just what I was expecting: a collection of spiritual and philosophical truisms on life's most fundamental subjects. Unlike what I'veheard about The Alchemist, it is light on story and heavy on teachings, which may divide its audience. The coming battle in Jerusalem is only the framework around which Coelho writes the life-affirming adages of the Copt. In this sense Manuscript Found in Accra is like the Indian scripture The Bhagavad Gita, which also opens at the brink of war before spouting its spiritual truths. You don't have to be religious to enjoy this book but its much of its impact depends on your life experiences and beliefs. The ideas that resonated most with me were found in the chapters on solitude, as I'm a firm believer in it, and success, because I agree with the Copt's definition of success. My favorite quotes (from my uncorrected ARC):<br /><br />  \\"If you are never alone, you cannot know yourself.\\"<br /><br />  \\"For those who feel oppressed by solitude, it's important to remember that in life's most significant moments we are always alone.\\"<br /><br />  \\"Success comes to those who do not waste their time comparing what they are doing with what others are doing; it enters the house of the person who says `I will do my best' every day.\\"<br /><br />  \\"What is success? It is being able to go to bed every night with your soul at peace.\\"<br /><br />What I liked about the book as a whole is that regardless of how each chapter affected me each subject builds upon the next, making each chapter richer in meaning and perspective. The book ends with this prescriptive from the Copt: \\"Go in peace.\\" I think I will.
B00COHIFQS|1.0|Sisters and girlfriend were excellent actors,too bad movie sucked, CG not much better than SyFy original. Story fairly ludicrous,(SPOILER) fear sequel of baby's daddy,PaPa. I do have to mention creepy part of aunt coming in the house,maybe a Rug Doctor could have helped her? Just saying.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like that numbers are large and easy to use.  Would recommend to anyone.<br />No complaints so far.  Thank you/
B009LDD5E0|1.0|Naya Rivera is the only good thing about glee but is underused too much this year. Characters are ruined and storylines are boring. Do not buy.
B008P9M614|5.0|The house MD is less dramatic than other medical dramas. Each episodes have unique symptoms in diagnosing, consistent characters, and compelling stories.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This is a great game... everyone one should give it a try and play it... I really like it and I hope you do to..
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This is a beautifully written story about love and loss. Although that is a common theme for authors,  The Language of Flowers is anything but common.  I read often but rarely feel moved to write a review.  This book and its characters has stuck with me and I've passed it along to a chain of other readers. Ms. Diffenbaugh has her work cut out for her to produce a sophomore book after this gem...but I can't wait to read it!!!
193700788X|1.0|I knew the last 4 book in the series seen to get worse and worse but this is the worst of the lot.  This goes way beyond which teams you was rooting for because this book is bad, wipe your rear bad.  Her publisher, editor, and butt kissers should have told her so.  This book should have never made it to the book shelves and CH should be ashamed to call this her book.<br /><br />DEA starts in the 3rd person.  Yes I know, Sookie books are not told in the 3rd person.  CH, if you are going to deviate, at least give us all the people's POV we actually give a crap about.<br /><br />Tara in this book sounds like tv Tara.  Ebonics for the two white girls.  Sam acts like no HEA, rapist Bill is redeemed and Eric's character was assassinated and sold into slavery for 200 years.  He loses everything.<br /><br />Really, I have nothing good to say about this book and I know for a fact I will never buy another book by this author.  When I calm down more, I will put a full review in.<br /><br />Read this book at you own risk.  You have been warned.
B00BR0SEAK|5.0|GREAT CD FROM A CLASSIC BAND!  VERY GOOD MUSIC.  As good as th e Deep Purple albums from the 70's.

The kids enjoyed singing the tunes. Johnathan particularly enjoyed the campy, yet moody sounds of &#34;Monstrous Clock.&#34; Little Ashley had a ball singing along to the oh-so-melodic &#34;Body and Blood.&#34; But for me, my favorite song, hands down, was &#34;Depth of Satan's Eyes.&#34; I love this band and appreciate all that they are doing. If we don't warn kids about satan, who will? Looking to book them for Easter next year!!!<br /><br />God bless, y'all!

Now, though, it's still amusing and provides lots of opportunities for random quotes but it wasn't as hilarious as I remembered. That being said, my kids enjoyed it, although it was a tad boring/scary for my 7 year old. Speaking of kids, there are some curse words and Sigorney Weaver gets fairly cleavagy at times and the villain could be scary for lil' guys.<br />Bottom line - if you haven't seen this movie, you should!
