B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Get it now or get off the app store!! It is the best game u have ever played. Get it!!
1936608898|5.0|I have been trying to loss weight for several years.  A friend told me about Whole 30 and I bought the book.  Now 30 days later and 16 pounds lighter I am a believer.  I hope to stay with everything the Whole 30 talked about and cant wait to loss more weight.  Thank you Whole 30.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The Book Thief is an excellent book. Most books I read for entertainment they don't invoke emotion. The Book Thief does, be prepared for a good read with feelings.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|My husband has been telling me how great this show is for years. A friend of mine recently got obsessed, and I started seeing others who were, so I finally decided to watch, and I couldn't stop. The relationship between Sam and Dean is fantastic and complex, and the stories draw you in right from the start. I'm generally not a huge paranormal fan, but I really love this series.
006202406X|2.0|I normally do not write book reviews, this is my first one, and I am only doing so because I felt so strongly about the ending to what WAS a very impressive trilogy.  The third installment of the Divergent series left me dissapointed and sad, mostly because of the unnecessary ending, but also because I felt that the book as a whole did not live up to the standards or quality present in the previous two books.  There are a few different ways this could have ended without the death of a main character, and the author's message would still be apparent.  I agree with many other readers that the dual POV's were confusing to differentiate, and the overall plot was weak compared to that of the first two.  New characters were not fleshed out well enough, and the main antagonist was not very impressive.  I feel that I could do a better job of writing this book than the author did, and I'm not a professional writer.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I ordered this product through Amazon and received Ira weeks before the store could have one for me to buy.<br />Very happy, except you can't pah your downloaded movies off your phone, tablet or laptop and watch them on the TV. Only purchased ones from Hulu, Google and Netflix. Bummed thati want aware of this before I bought it.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Great show<br />Reading the books is always better but they did a pretty good job.<br />Have to pay attention to the variety of storylines ... a little tough to jump in the middle
B00AQIZRLS|3.0|my 3-year old does not love it, she only likes it a bit. which is a perfect 3 star score.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I had to read this again after watching the movie. My boyfriend kept asking questions and I was getting frustrated trying to remember what details they left out of the movie or what was in the mockingjay book. Of course the movie was good. I love the characters they chose but of course they left out important parts like katniss being aware that there might be a district 13 and of course what a smart bad ads survivalist she is!! I. Absolutely love this series!! Suzanne Collins is an amazing writer!
B00BP29SAA|4.0|my 3 year old loves it. and since i got it for her, i should probably give it 5 stars. but it gets old.
B00BSDTG44|4.0|This is a Stereo only release, taken from the original 2 track master tapes and offered in uncompressed PCM, DTS-Master Audio and Dolby HD Audio. Several song takes differ from the CD release but may be identical to the LP. There is no information indicating why this is so and there are two bonus tracks, Easy Skanking and Funky Reggae Party, included. There is a booklet inside which has the lyrics, photos and credits. Video is a static picture of the cover with numerical track listing, no titles, along with the available sound options. Sound is readily apparent a superior upgrade from what already is a very good sounding CD with a very low noise floor and little in the way of tape hiss (except the acoustic Redemption Song). Dynamics are off the charts and you can play this as loud as you want and still not run into major non-equipment distortion issues. While it may never satisfy a true die-hard Analog audiophile, I think this will be a very appealing addition to your hi-res stereo library for us digitalphiles. While I bemoan the lack of surround sound titles in this format, this would not be a candidate given its 2 track origins. One other offering from this label, Beck's Sea Change, is in 5.1 and stereo and hopefully more is on the way but am disappointed that for whatever reason Breakfast In America is not one of them. Overall, this is a very good sounding Blu-ray and worth a listen.
B000OXHRRC|5.0|This movie has the best of everything: a great story line, travel, romance, a little comedy.  Perfect for a night in alone!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is so much fun!!!!!! I like to play it a lot.it's fun when you get to feed your horse.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Not full featured but has what you need.  Helps Kindle owners connect to the world and great way to view photos/video you have uploaded to the cloud.
B00785P2QC|4.0|GREAT GAME it's a great game for everyone to play day in and day out. RIP Sparkey Scoates you were a great dog.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Love this app! I can make easy to remove lists or one to just keep updating. Great for on the fly stuff to remember where i don't like making the calendar entry quick reminders. Color option also allow personal priority glances for sorting too. Like holiday and regular shopping lists!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love playing Candy Crush Saga, it's an very challenging and addictive game. I am hooked yes i love this game.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Unpredictable well written and intriguing.  It was a page turner, and believable.  My book group is hard to please and everyone loved it!
B009YU6FJM|5.0|Amazing through and through. Deftones came back with an album that will go down as one of their best ever.
B00338QENI|5.0|This should be a must read in high school.  I've met and talked to doctors about this incredible journey who have endorsed this book for a must read for medical students and social workers alike.
B00335EQ0E|5.0|IT WAS A FAST AND EASY WAY TO GET WHAT I WANTED. I WILL DO MORE SHOPPING THIS WAY. GOOD PRODUCST AT GOOD COST. liked  THE DVD THE WAY TO GO
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Love this game i play it on the time on my kindle and online...it sure is a challenge at times and thats what i love about this game!!! The only down fall is the lives it gives you, if you dont win to the next level you loose a life and i believe it only gives you 3 or 4 at a time :(
B00CDY6HW6|5.0|Awesome game! Innovative, cute little bunnies, rockets, stairs. It's easy too learn, but with just the right amount of difficult to keep you playing!
B000P1KTW8|5.0|amazing album. Recommends this for everyone. This is the best blu-ray that I have.<br />The price is very nice. Best one.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This, and all the expansions, are fun games! They keep adding more and keeping the games interesting. Easy enough for my six year old, difficult to keep me playing!
B004EC5IV6|4.0|Okay, first things first: This movie is absolutely fantastic.  Everything in it, from the characters, to the story, to the animation, this was a pleasure to watch.<br /><br />The story started off with an epic fight scene between a giant Angel (monster) and an Evangelion piloted by a new character.  After the scene, the film basically picks up the main series Evangelion after where Asuka was introduced.  One difference though: this was incredibly dark, and was an absolute feast for the eyes.<br /><br />My only complaint comes with the disc itself.  I only cared about disc one, a.k.a the one with the movie on it, which had a giant line going down it.  It caused massive glitches, and I could barely watch my favorite scenes from Toonami's airing of it.  However, this is expected, since the discs were apparently made in Mexico, and distributed from Kansas City. (The past sentence was intended for purpose of comedy, not to offend anybody.)<br /><br />While that was a massive issue, the content the film gave me more than made up for it.<br /><br />Film Itself - 9.74/10<br />Disc and other issues - 5.22/10<br />Recommendation - Get this thing on your shelf, ASAP!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Very cool app! My 6 year old loves it too! It's got that cartoon feeling, but it moves like an app/game should.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Just love it great graphics and so realistic looking horses and caring for them is as real as do in life.
B0087EACJK|5.0|I remember playing this way back when it was a web game and playing it for days! The sequel is great! They added the ability to spin it around, which is awesome!
0316227706|5.0|This is something that i would have never thought was so cool to look at, but its truely is amazing!
B0097K21YW|5.0|Another one of my 6 year olds favorite games! It's easy enough for him to figure out but keeps me busy trying to get gold medals!
B00GINENG0|5.0|Great game for any one one of my favorites and its soo funny almost every one I know love it ....every<br />One else has never seen it
B00D48BT5A|5.0|I confess to loving Bill Bryson's work but I have to say this is one of his best.  A great snapshot of an intriguing time in America.
B00DG292SK|5.0|Written in a flat conversational style that is very engaging. He discusses his awful childhood in a matter-of-fact way that works well when he transitions to meeting and working with names we are all familiar with. Recommend.
B00338QENI|4.0|This book was interesting and told a story vital to the history of scientific inquiry. That being said, I would have liked some more in depth exploration of the different projects the HeLa cells were instrumental in. The author mentioned quite a few, but the details were lacking.<br /><br />The story of the family is definitely interesting.
B00B7FOQCK|2.0|I was looking for a 3 or 4 port, bus powered usb3 hub. This one fit the bill at an affordable price. However, much to my disappointment, the quality and workmanship of this product is rather subpar. For one, the usb female plugs are not fully aligned with the plastic casing openings, which makes it quite difficult to know whether you inserting the usb plug correctly. Secondly, they made it a very tight fit between male and female usb plug, to a fault: you never know if you are force-jamming it in there or is just how tight the plug is.<br /><br />TL;DR: subpar quality and design. Look elsewhere.
B008602KQI|4.0|Good plot, plenty of action throughout, despotism of capitol city shows through in the comparison of the poor living conditions in the districts versus the glamour and excess of the capitol.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|This is the first Preston & Child book I have read.  I am hooked.  Great characters, great story-line, and kept my interest all through the book.
B007T99ENE|4.0|Sweet Tooth by Ian McEwan.<br />I enjoyed the book, but it is not his best. 'Atonement'  is way better- but that sets the bar very high.<br />The narrator is a twenty two year old woman, and I kept having to ask myself &#34;Is he showing us all that he can get into the head of a young woman?&#34;<br />For the first time in years I have read no five star books this year-- plenty of four star, so maybe I am just getting too picky.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son is A D D. he plays minecraft for hours. It really sooths him works his mind for his benefit!!! Love it
B00G32OER4|5.0|Went to a lecture one time by the Warrens.  They told of many experiences with the paranormal, but one in particular I remember was the story in this movie.  I was creeped out then and I was creeped out even more after watching this movie.  I've seen alot of &#34;scarey&#34; movies in my life but this is a good one.  From an old pro like me-get this movie!!!!!!!  Watch it at night with the lights turned down.....heh  heh  heh  heh................
0439023513|5.0|This book series kept my 9-year old occupied every waking moment.  He preferred to read rather than watch TV during the 3 weeks it took him to read all three books.  Neither his teachers or I could peel him away.  I'm struggling to find another set of books that could match the effect of this set.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun game love it would not change anything but the places that you need help fun fun fun fun fun fun ItY
B00AEFYCDW|5.0|Saw this movie 10yrs ago, wanted to show a friend the movie...had the same amazing impact. The fact it is directed by Sean Penn who read the personal impact of this story for himself in himself, I relate, and  loved how it was put on film.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|love christian movies great movie for laughs. provides a great aspect on what true christian men should really be doing to make a great God ready life
B00E6Z0THE|1.0|Too much moving from place to place. Very easy to get lost. Can be confusing where to go as it's pretty much like a maze to get from one area to another. Quests are fun, but hate all of the moving around.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I am not in to Sand M. The endless listings of emails in the book were totally unnecessary. I skipped over a lot of them. The heroine appeared to have a childish immature mentality.
B004SBX112|4.0|My son actually bought this game on accident. He has ended up playing it a lot, so it is fine. It is nice to have a game that is ad-free! another fun Angry Birds game
039916409X|5.0|I love the exercises in every chapter and the tapping scripts. Been working on it a little bit at a time. Discovering things about my beliefs surrounding money that I never knew I had. Looking forward to seeing some really positive changes to come!
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|This app is fun to use to keep track of ideas and to-do lists. I am currently using it to keep track of notes that I have about a party that I would like to have. My favorite feature is that you can put a password on the notes. I think that is nice.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|So, I am a total metalhead.  I listen to Death Metal and mostly extreme metal.  However, I have my guilty pleasures in Lady Gaga.  I have been a fan since the Fame.<br /><br />In short I think Artpop is a fantastic album.  A good variety of tunes and all are high quality for this type of music.<br />Gaga's albums usually have a song or two I don't enjoy.  This one is no exception and the song is like usual one that most others go gaga over.  It is Dope.<br /><br />I will still give it full marks because I like the album overall and feel it is a great addition to her discography.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Pretty fun! I can see why people become addicted to it because we like to have something to do. I am glad it is on my Kindle rather than my phone.
0316228532|2.0|not up to the quality of the Harry Potter books - the story line is totally disappointing.  Her grammar and use of language is great, as usual, but this book is a dud.
B0095HHM78|5.0|It's been a while since I've seen a movie that goes beyond the predictable plot lines.  This one was out of the ballpark with a great story told in a unique and interesting way which actually causes one to think about its message. Very well done.  Will definitely add it to my collection to watch again and again as time goes by for inspiration of what it is to be alive from the past, present and into the future.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Every time I read a John Grisham novel I try not to color it with my view of his prior writings. But I really can't let go of my (unreasonably?) high expectations. This book was saved from a worse rating only because I did enjoy the story up to the very end. However, I hated the ending of this book so much! It totally fell short of Grisham's spectacular. earth-shattering reveals. It was so lazy, so unbelievable, so fantastic! I won't give away any spoilers, but I really wish I hadn't read the last couple of chapters. It reminds me of how I felt after watching the movie 'Flight' only to realise it was an ad for Alcoholics Anonymous: totally let down. The case for reparations deserved better treatment than being appended to this book in such an unconvincing way.
B00DEG4Z1W|4.0|Awesome app but I do have to give it a 3 star cause there are some downs but over all it is a great app -app  critic
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and its intertwined stories. The ending left me with so many mixed emotions, which was probably the 'writer's intention'. LOL. Above all, even though the writing was flowery, the characters were realistic and relatable.  Of course, the book sent me on a search for Afghan poetry, which I am learning to appreciate. This is definitely a (me)-certified good read, and I would highly recommend it.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|As always, I thoroughly enjoyed reading Cornwell. I have been hooked on the Scarpetta series from the beginning. I highly recommend this book.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This book was perhaps Grisham's best book. It basically is a story about a trial held in the south associated with a large inheritance left to a black lady and the appeal of the deceased's family. The story line is very compelling and the characters are very well developed. It was hard to put the book down after starting to read it.<br />Al Estrada
B002GYI9C4|5.0|I wrote a (slightly) longer review of the third book (with no spoilers), but suffice to say that this trilogy (despite a few slow patches and the occasional sappy moment) is phenomenal.  I have read a lot of fantasy, and rarely have I found a world that is so completely developed.  You won't regret reading these books.
B00B2DSK06|5.0|It was good for our 3 and 5 yr old boys. some funny moments for the adults too. not violent.
0060853980|5.0|I was once told by a friend that anyone who really appreciates an art/media form (books, music, etc) has one thing that they love so much that they're afraid to recommend it, in case other people don't love it as much as they do.<br /><br />For me, this is that book.<br /><br />I'm sorry if I've over sold it for you, but this is my favorite book.  It's probably not the best book ever, and it may not be your favorite.  But it is mine.  For any of you that are fans of Gaiman and Pratchett, this is everything you would hope a collaboration by the two of them would be.
0783227434|5.0|What can I say, Bruce Cambell is the best , His acting is like none other, and timing impeccable, a true pioneer .
B002LC8HF0|5.0|I got fed up with this book and put it down for a long time.  I picked it up when I got equally fed up with another book, and I am very happy that I did.<br /><br />I'll admit that it drags a bit in the middle, but this trilogy is one of the most completely imagined, immersive fantasy worlds I've ever encountered.  Sanderson never once gives the impression that he is inventing plot points.  There is not the inexorable, implausible arms race that you get in many fantasy series, where the protagonist keeps getting more powerful, and yet out of nowhere keeps encountering equally powerful monsters mentioned in legends from long ago (I'm looking at you, Terry Goodkind).<br /><br />Rather, Sanderson keeps exposing further layers of complexity, granting resolution to mysteries introduced in the first book only in the closing chapters of the third.  Everything fits together, and it is extremely gratifying.  Not to mention gripping.
B003TU166U|2.0|I purchased my first pair of Teva's about 10 years ago I could do anything in them and with all the abuse would always perform great and last down to the last nub on the sole. This last pair I bought , even though it had the same name and style, fit uncomfortably, felt as if it had no cushioning compared to the last 6 pairs I purchased through the years. I actually threw out a pair that was 5 years old that were in better shape . Even though the sole and straps seem to be in new condition the basic lining is all loose, the straps stretched to an uncomfortable loose feel.Lets say they were not worth the price and be warned you can't always rely on brand names being trustworthy .
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Great author, loved this book! I was captured at the first page. I'm looking forward to reading more from this author .
B00GII9UCW|5.0|I agree with Majumdar and wonder why Gilby Mitnick even mentioned the sex addiction or Norah Jones Indian heritage. True she is the daughter of Ravi Shankar but her mother Sue Jones with her involvement in the music industry played far more influence on Norah’s style. From The Little Willies on to all her collaborations, Norah is definitely Americana.<br /><br />Makes me wonder what Gilby has in his closet but again he lives in mom’s basement so let’s get past him.<br /><br />This is pure Americana and storytelling through song. The vocal harmonies are perfect but I wish Norah had more dominance. An excellent choice for sit back and relax listening.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|The narrative was different than the first two books and it just didn't work.  Not too fond of the ending either.
B008IJT0CE|1.0|wouldn't work on my andriod.. locked up every time I tried to use this app.  maybe on a different pc of equipment ???
006202406X|1.0|I agree with the majority of the 1 and 2 stars on here and I won't get into much detail. I really liked Divergent. It was a book I couldn't put down and I went out to buy Insurgent the day after I finished it. I didn't like Insurgent as much as Divergent, but overall I still thought it was a good book. I was really excited for Allegiant, and I really wanted to know what was outside of the fence. I read a lot of books, and this one was a chore to finish. It took me close to 2 weeks to read it because I just couldn't get into the story. I pushed through hoping it would get better and it never really did. I didn't have a problem with Tris dying because I kind of expected it to happen, but I thought the way that she died was kind of stupid. I've read a decent number of books were the main character dies, and this one was handled the most poorly. Like many have stated, the duel narrative did not work at all. It didn't add anything to the story in my opinion. This started out as a very promising series, but unfortunately it never really went anywhere.
B000002KGT|5.0|This is a terrific album by Fleetwood Mac. It and their first album (Fleetwood Mac) are must-haves for 70s Rock collectors. I'm learning some of the songs on guitar.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|As long you don't take the story too seriously, it is light, humorous and entertaining. It's too bad that the protagonist is a hundred years old or we could possibly have had a sequel to look forward too!
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|Other than one minor detail, everything looks great. I just received my package in the mail, and everything is as described.
B004UNX1LS|4.0|I hate to admit it as a music lover, but the older I get, it is hard to keep up with the latest music trends.  This app is helping to keep me up-to-date on the latest music.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I only knew 3 songs when I bought this CD but the entire CD is awesome.  I just bought tickets to their concert too.
B0087X1V6Y|5.0|While not as good as the first in the series, still a wonderful story.<br /><br />Rich, deep characters combined with a living world take the reader to another world.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a great book. Not appropriate for anyone under 18 in my opinion, but still it is a great book.
0812550757|4.0|Speaker of the dead might as well not include Ender Wiggin.  In many respects, this novel and Ender's Game are not really related.<br /><br />Orson Scott Card gives us an interesting world with its own unique biology and shoe horns Ender Wiggin into it for some reason.  It is still an enjoyable read but I wish he had used a different character as his lead.
B009NF54ZE|2.0|There is too much talking and nothing new or interesting in the game. Same old, same old. There just isn't much to this game that I haven't seen before...over and over again.
0812550706|5.0|An alien race called the Formics have attacked the Earth twice.  Humanity, in a desperate attempt to survive the third wave of the war, has brought together the world's most ingenius children in an effort to train them to become the greatest military minds in history.  Above them all is Ender Wiggin.
1455508977|5.0|I haven't read the entire book; however, the condition in which it came was excellent. It felt like it was brand new!
B000FC12SM|5.0|This guy has learnt things over the years that will keep many marriages from splitting!  It is great to really take on board that we are so different,men and women
0143039431|3.0|As for the content of the book, this book is boring as hell. I wouldn't recommend reading it, but it was a requirement for school. It is a classic, and it's good, but just boring. If you're thinking about reading it for leisure, I wouldn't recommend it, unless you're a hard core literary nut. As for the book itself, it was in fairly good condition... Not great, but not terrible
B004EF65QA|5.0|Really enjoyed this mini series. I was looking for other works of Richard Armitage and found this. I ordered the DVD set.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Makes watching Netflix a breeze.  I wish it would allow me to stream any online video I wanted as it is very specific to what it will allow (Netflix, Hulu, YouTube), but if you watch Netflix as much as I do it's very nice.  Switches seamlessly between my husband's and my phones as remotes.  I like it better than the Wii and Motorola tablet we previously used for Netflix.  I'll probably get another one for the bedroom.  Price can't be beat!  I'd give it 5 stars if it worked with more streaming applications!<br /><br />Pros: Use phone as remote<br />  Ease of use with Netflix<br /><br />Cons: Limited applications
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|This game is great. Perfect to relax to and just build some things. It's just like the one on PC only problem is if you intend to play for a while bring your charger it uses a lot of battery rather quicker then I would like it to.<br /><br />But that's nothing to take away from the game. If you enjoyed it on the pc you'll enjoy it here.
B0037VNX44|5.0|I needed a Tom Hardy fix. And he showed his range and a whole lot more. I was really surprised at the nudity. This was a trippy interesting story that I never heard of before. Maybe because I live in America. I loved it though...
B007IXWL2C|5.0|OMG!!!  I can't put them down. I'm reading them for the fifth time!  Talk about an aphrodisiac!  All I can say is that the movie would have to have a XXX rating to be true to this trilogy!  Just sayin'
B00A5FPN48|3.0|It entertained me while I redid my hair. I had my head down most of the time however ... !
B008KOTNVA|5.0|compact case.  So many useful attachments and they're magnetic!  Love it.  Nice to not have to magnetize tools w/out using my speakers.  Magnetized is very important when dealing with small components.  Very nice kit!
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I watch this movie about 2-3 times a month. It took the place of my 300 fetish. It's beautifully violent.
B008YKGQR4|2.0|I was seriously disappointed after I got it. It worked alright, I guess, it was the same as the browser version, but then, stuff became all distorted and colors reversed and it all just glitches up. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND FOR KINDLE FIRE HD
B00GTZJLAK|4.0|Fun movie.  Most all children can enjoy it, but some of the humor is geared more toward probably 7 years and up.
B000FBJF6Y|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It feels like home; creating images of character and country that are vivid and engrossing.
B00GLX1MG6|5.0|Excellent movie. One of the best comedies I have seen in a long time. Lots of laughs and quite enjoyable. Worth looking at twice.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|Denzel, as always, is great but I just didn't enjoy the movie as much as many of his others.  I think some parts were just too unbelievable.
0141394811|3.0|A walk through the ocean of Morrissey's soul would scarcely get your feet wet. Why must we give so much credence to the opinions & thoughts of artists & actors who are generally broken , inexperienced & uninformed.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love to play this game and really love the challenge. This game is absolutely a keeper! I have enjoyed hours of fun playing it.
B00BEOYPKW|5.0|Terrific album that does not try to fit into a radio friendly stereotype. It's so good it's getting air time.
B003UESJF6|4.0|Great animated feature! Very well written and loved Will Farrell as the villain. In this movie we see Megamind who, like  Richard III, is determined to play the villain if he cannot play the hero. Definitely something I will watch again.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The calculator on my Kindle Fire is wonderful.  I have a ton of recipes downloaded on my KF and when I need to convert ingredients, it comes in very, very handy.  I highly recommend it to anyone who has a KF.  There are numerous applications where it can be helpful, for me this is \\"the\\" best one.  Now, I can't live without it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is the best thing I've purchased for my TV since the TV itself. We opted NOT to get the smart TV as it was a few hundred dollars in savings by just having a 'dumb' TV. When I heard about this I had to get one considering the price and the majority of the media I watch comes from the applications this already supports! I can't wait to see how far they push this little device!
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|Pretty filthy.  Funny, but the language was hard to take.  Wish people could be funny AND clean.  Funny parts, but all the cursing made me cringe.
B0039TAHMA|5.0|Cool movie, but equally important was renting from Amazon.  I had not done so in the past, and was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was.  Double clicking on the movie made it fit my television better.
B003B02O0A|5.0|Excellent writing and reading.keep interests even though previously read and saw the movie.  Loved Sycamore Row too and hope a movie is made.
B00519YOY8|4.0|Tom Hanks is BIG in the early film &#34;Big&#34;.  In fact, ev eryone is &#34;big&#34; in this imaginative, lively movie, directed by Penny Marshall and co-starring arresting action by Robert Loggia--a favorite--John Heard, the star's best young pal, and, of course, at times bewildered Elizabeth Perkins.  This one is up there with two of Tom Hanks movie gems Splash!  and Turner and Hooch ( the big slobbering dog).  Hanks has gone on to make  a series of movies which mostly stand out as a superb filmography for the veteran actor, who has won two Academy Awards back-to-back for Philadelphia and Forest Gump.
B00FLDG5BE|5.0|So looking forward to getting this set. I was lucky enough to attend Crossroads 2013 (bucket list check). Will be getting this for us and all my friends who wanted to be at the show with us!! Clapton is timeless.
0143116738|5.0|This book is so helpful in understanding that we all learn differently and that is a good thing. The stories in this book explain a lot about education and how our system doesn't work and what we need to do to improve it.
B00F7YHDWC|3.0|this app is great and I like earning new little characters but it is way short. it is soo easy to earn all the characters and beat the game. nice job but you guys need to make it longer/more challenging
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|great TV serie from AMC<br />The first season is very good, I'll buy the latest seasons.<br />I recomend this TV serie.<br />If you love Zombies you will love Walking dead
B00B5HQL50|4.0|It shows the true relationship of M and Bond and how Bond will go to no boundaries to protect her.
B004LWZW7O|3.0|good movie<br />Time is everything, Justin performed well, he makes you forget hi is not an actor<br />I'll recommend this movie
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|The game isn't too hard and I find that I can't put it down. It's just difficult enough to keep my attention without making me angry and frustrated that I can't figure it out. That's nice for a change. Usually it's either too hard or too easy. But this game is just right.
B0081JFGQU|5.0|Great live album, I LOVE this band.  One of those bands where their studio albums are great, but live is WOW!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|There are a lot of comedians whose funnies don't translate into books, but Tina Fey did not disappoint. Thank you, Tina Fey!
B0055SWM08|5.0|One of the best games I have purchased for my kindle fire. I don't understand how these games can be free and 99 cents, but I can get use to it. It sure makes up for the price of the kindle fire. The cost is greatly justified. It is more than equal to that of a song or even on the same level of an episode of a television show. I usually don't give a five star rating, but this game is really something extra special.
B00DTUKJJ0|5.0|This was one of the best books I've read in a while from start to finish it was non stop action. When's the next one???? (\\",)
B008IGP8QE|5.0|this is my daughters crush and she loved the cd. the music is ok for kids to listen to and its clean
B008476HBM|5.0|Needless to say that this is one of the most pleasant books to read for a young woman. I have enjoyed it very much.
B007SSEZNA|5.0|A classic for good reasons. We had not seen this previously. But my wife, a woman with a bit more class than I possess, had read several Jane Austin books. I enjoyed this movie more than I had anticipated and will look out for more opportunities to read Jane Austin or see her works on film. The acting seemed stellar...all around.
B00FP1NNJY|1.0|Another lackluster track from Pitbull.<br /><br />Can just one of his songs be different from all his other songs? I guess not.
B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|This was one of those movies that builds you up the whole time just to let you down hard at the end.  I'll try not to give the whole thing away but the face you see on the dvd cover and in the previews is pretty damn scary during the movie.  I'm not going to lie I was pretty freaked out by it.  So I was expecting some really scary s*** at the end.  And all the murders are horrific so you're thinking, \\"Man what a psycho!  DUDE GET OUT OF THERE!\\"  Then at the end you find out what ties it all together and you're like really? ANd then you find out who has been committing the murders and you're like, REALLY???? COME ONNNNN.  I didn't have any trouble falling asleep after watching this movie.
B00AB65SVE|4.0|LOVED this show, laughed out loud during every episode.  However Season four is either getting old, running out of humorours story lines, or changed writers.  It is still good, but not as good as the first few seasons.  I still recommend it.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Very good game and I love the idea of having to find hidden objects. The graphics and music are wonderful.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It's nice to catch up with Danny Torrence, to see what kind of man the events of &#34;the Shining&#34; made him. It's like putting on an old pair of boots to walk a new trail.
1451666179|5.0|I love the blog. I love the book. I read it all as soon as the package arrived. Very awesome.
B000002LLC|1.0|I ordered this album thinking it contained some songs I wanted to hear and use.  However, upon listening to it, I was disappointed to find that the contents were not what I wanted.  Amazon is not at fault; I am.  It was just my mistake.  To be sure, Amazon's packing and delivery were excellent as always.  Thank you.
0765337541|5.0|The book was in good shape and arrived promptly. I appreciate the service and efficiency. I strongly recommend this book. The movie was good, too. There are other books in the series, including &#34;Speaker for the Dead&#34;, and &#34;Xenocide&#34;. Ender's game is the first book I've read since the Harry Potter books that had an interesting story. Yeah, I know, Ender's game was written before the Potter books, but I read it later.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|Pretty good dictionary but does not do great on the Kindle<br />I do recommend it for reading chapter books I hope you can use it
B00C5R7B0I|2.0|I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's novels, and I look forward to each new Scarpetta in the series with much anticipation, but unfortunately, Dust is just not well written. While I agree that I liked Kay Scarpetta better in Dust than in some of her books, I just didn't find the story compelling. It was almost as if it were &#34;phoned in.&#34; There is not much in the way of plot, and she spends way too much time telling instead of showing. There is no real pathos, and no character development of the victims or the killer. The only reason I kept reading until the end was because I have a connection to the main characters and wanted to see it through. But if this were my first Cornwell novel, I would have put it down after 50 pages. It just isn't very interesting. I am not giving up on Patricia Cornwell, but I sure hope her next Scarpetta novel has more action and more depth.
B00E3IZIM0|4.0|Simple, Good Action, Interesting Premise.  The amount of detail given to the Kaiju & Jaegers is phenomenal. I've watched plenty of 80-90s anime and it is about time someone was able to bring that world to the big screen.
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|Buy this CD. Screaming vocals, screaming guitars, melodies galore.  If you know Stryper you will love this CD.  If you don't, you need to get to know them.  Better to buy it and listen than read reviews!  Buy it.  This is the best Album of their careers, period.
B0076XDGZ0|5.0|I would say this is my favorite album that came out this year. It has immense talent and the songs are awesome. It does take a few listens though. So don't judge based on your first listen.
B003YV64OI|5.0|A great bargain multicore CPU. Blazes through everyday tasks with ease. Can handle standard gaming tasks when paired with a decent GPU. Not for high-end gaming or video production or anything, but should be able to handle the demands of an average computer user for years to come.
B00F91SCXC|1.0|Terrible and cliche, so predictable, characters have no depth and very cheesy.  I was very disappointed as I'm a big fan of this director
B007REV4YI|5.0|It's James Bond...how can you go wrong.  Daniel Craig has taken the Bond character to new levels but brings it back to the Sean Connery style.
B00358ESI4|4.0|I think this is the best Vietnam movie.  It deals with the entire experience from the training in the US the ensuing battles and the eventual return to the US.
B00BIK3FAI|5.0|I really like it and so did my baby cousins. This is truly for all ages. Everyone will enjoy it.
B00EJOCAYW|2.0|Almost 50 bucks and this thing is TINY. Amazing how cross-merchadising to a &#34;hot&#34; product like Minecraft can turn a handful of plastic pieces into a cash cow. I will not be returnig it because it would break my son's heart. he's not disappointed enough to give it up. But he is disappointed.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I love that this game is free and yu don't have to pay real money to buy other robots and I destroy everything in my way
1451666179|5.0|Allie Brosh is emotionally wise and hella funny. Her description of depression is spot on and she really nails how weird kids are.
0201633612|2.0|I believe this book is a little overrated.<br /><br />As Venkat Subramaniam defined them at a conference, the patterns are like your grandma's recipes: you can write it down as best as you can but it will never turn out the same! And it's true. Besides the most obvious and broadly used patterns, like Singleton, many of the described patterns can be confusing, repetitive and somewhat obscure to the uninitiated reader. Moreover, many patterns are superseded by functional programming concepts such as functions as first class objects, mixins, non-blocking concurrency, map/reduce, etc. which make many patterns easier to understand and implement in terms of functional concepts (even using non-functional languages).
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King has been in my life for more years than I care to admit. He has scared me so badly that I couldn't sleep with a book in the same room. He has made me laugh, cry and sometimes given me that ickyness in the pit of my stomach but he has always made it real. In keeping with a long history of \\"good reads\\" Doctor Sleep won't let you down. I couldn't put this one down which to me is bittersweet, as I never want the good ones to end... If your a SK fan read is book you won't be disappointed- A Constant Reader
B0044XRIMW|5.0|Classic film, catchy songs, incredible acting and choreography, and a relatable story. If you haven't already watched it, make sure you do!
B00FVVR2ZO|4.0|keep running out of energy I rufuse to purchase crape on free apps so well...... not enough peoplenon it yet to gift much..... would like.to have more time
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This bag is everything I hoped it would be.  Compartments can be sized as needed.  Comfortable back pack.  I'm surprised there aren't more like it out there to choose from!  Someone got it right!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Such a beautiful, beautiful book.  I've never had the power of words brought home to me in such a gut-wrenching, tender way as this.  Markus Zusak is a poet whose soul is very \\"soft\\" and \\"light\\".
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a cool, fun, free brain teaser. os full of challenges from easy to hard to almost insane. What more could you want.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|I like the game, it throws me off sometimes because the little Dragon gives you a ball to shot when there's no practical way you can hit any thing.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I can't say enough about this little device. The convenience of not having another box, or just being able to find what I want to watch/listen to on my phone or tablet and send it to my TV... For iOS users, it supports Netflix, Hulu Plus, HBO Go, Pandora, and Google Play Music. Being able to play my music on my TV with just a couple clicks on my phone is unbelievable and I plan on buying one of these for every TV in my home.
B0043WDK2G|5.0|Fun, romantic and sexy without trashy scenes.....Just discovered the TV show Castle and I love it.  Had to have the entire season and plan on buying all the season DVDs.
B000002UWF|5.0|just loved him and like to enjoy him in the present just finished reading a book about a child he had with someone he never married
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|THIS GAME IS THE BEST YOU NEED TO DOWNLOAD IT. THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF SUITS WEPONS ARMORS  AND EVERYTHING IT IS MIND BLOWING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005R4255C|5.0|I don't know how to really review this one, just that's it's a good remix of his music blended in so well. King did and excellent job on this one. To me it's like listening to Micheal's music for the first time again. It might make sense if you see the Immortal Tour to understand why it ws put together the way it was. If you're a dancer and know his music and want reinvent a new routine, this is the c.d. to get. Pretty good for a good workout.  Get this c.d. if you're a fan, you won't be disppointed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like this game one is because you don't have to tilt the screen to go on the side of the game.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|easy to do and fun. love the style and the layout.<br />you have an energy bar so you're limited but everytime you level up it gives you extra energy space
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I personally enjoyed this book because it gives you the most realistic and immersive experience putting you in the shoes of seal team six and seeing what they went through to finish the task at hand
0141345659|5.0|I got this book as a gift for my daughter. She loved this book and couldn't stop reading it. I love when I can get my kids to read!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|The bloom is a mishmash.  Some of the story was excellent but most of it was boring and inadequate.  The story rambled.  Not very good.  3 stars was s gift.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Will Robie is a great character and I hope Mr. Baldacci puts him in more of his novels very soon.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Cal (calculator) is my new best friend. Never out of my reach and i never forget where i left him or if his batteries are dying.
B000ICXQOM|5.0|Just a cult classic! You can't go wrong with Bruce or this movie. Even now so many years later I find myself having it own it on bluray!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|mi love it. would like to give credit to the creator. thank u for making such a great game. mi love it!!!!
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|Good game way way better than the first one. Kills time when need be . Not action pact but fun any way. Easy to play for any age group
B005ES1D40|5.0|I loved the shape & also it is comfortable but somewhat i feel it is little bit small.<br />overall its great<br />i recommend it
B000ZLFALI|1.0|I bought this Dvd as a Birthday gift for my best friend . . But it didn't work . . Just a bunch of fuzzy snow . . Since she didn't attempt to watch it for almost a year . . It was too lateto return it for a refund. . However, I love this movie..  it is one of my favorites!
B000T433CO|5.0|One of my favorite movies!!  SO cute!  It is definitely a chick flick but my husband thought it was cute too!
B002QE3CTY|5.0|It has a lot of twists and your always excited to read on and you never know what is going to happen next.
B00B22ASUM|4.0|James was a mess. Bob was injured. By bringing them together, God healed both. A terrific story of trust, healing and love. I recommend it.
B00G9U7NEQ|5.0|LOVE this movie!  It's a fun watch for the whole family with kid and adult humor.  We even went back to watch this first and THEN watched Monsters Inc.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Cast meshes well, full of humor.  Special effects in some action scenes are cool enough to replay. Fun to watch.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|This book was an amazing journey of emotional questioning for each of the two female lead characters. Oliver did an excellent job offering a twisting story that captured your attention. Another page turner you won't want to put down!
B00BEIYM42|5.0|Probably the best thing Terence Stamp has ever done. You connect with the characters emotionally - even the grouch who has your total sympathy.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Allegiant was so much better than Insurgent.  strong female character and a story line that was probable.  Sad that the main character died at the end.  But what do expect???
B00FJTWK0U|5.0|Very realistic portrayal of a relationship.  This is the third in a series - each about 10 years apart.  Worth watching all three.
B00C5R7B0I|2.0|Not sure I'll pick up another Cornwell book. I use to love the stories with constant twists and turns Cornwell would write. This story is lacking in every way.  No depth to the characters, the plot superficial, and an ending that leaves you wondering...
B008JFUS5A|5.0|When Hunger Games came out I had mixed feelings about it. On one hand, it had Jennifer Lawrence in a role that would obviously make a star, an excellent overall cast, good writing, and not bad everything else. It was a throw-back to the old post-apocalyptic films of the 70's and 80's, and for once, an Indie feeling film with an experimental soundtrack and shaky-camera actually felt like a pretty good fit. It all felt rather...real.<br /><br />And on the other hand, the first Hunger Games is quite a downer of a film. Kids thrown into an arena to kill each other or die by various other means is hardly a fun topic, and you have to feel a bit guilty by being...entertained. But the whole point of the film was not to glorify that sort of thing, but rather to draw attention to the kind of world we have could perhaps make in the future, and what people are willing to do to survive, and to hold onto their humanity no matter what.<br /><br />Ultimately the first film didn't really have a climax exactly, It just kind of...ended. It kind of left you hanging in the air, obviously in anticipation of the sequels to come. And come they shall.<br /><br />This film is to the first Hunger Games what Thor:The Dark World was to Thor. It's more fleshed out, higher budget, has been writing, more character development, more style, FAR better cinematography, and and  more block-buster type special effects, sound mixing, and musical score. Is it better for it? I think so.<br /><br />The first film made us feel like we were in Appalachia and then whisked away to Rome for the gladiator arena. Everything to do with District 12 had a poverty-stricken, folksy feel about it that made it all very gripping and heart-breaking. And when the troops from the Capital poured in for a Reaping, it really felt like the technological overlords were coming down from on high to made examples out of the serfs. The games themselves were the hammer driving the nail home, with a resonating message that a nobody from nowhere could single-handedly make a difference, simply because they refused to play the game.<br /><br />Fast forward to now, and our perception of the world has changed as Katniss' perception has changed. She can't hide from the horribleness of the world anymore, because her actions have brought the world crashing down. She wanted to just return to her old way of life and forget the nightmare, but the old way of life is gone forever, and the nightmares are not going away. What is there left to do but face them?<br /><br />The first half of the first Hunger Games dragged a bit for me, but this sequel rockets through the film's setup in District 12, moving forcefully through the events that lead to the Quarter Quell. Everything is in-character. There are less quiet moments to contemplate and dream, because the world that lead to those quiet moments and dreams has been shattered. Everything is slicker, more futuristic, because the Capitol has made it's presence known. There is no need for quiet character development in slow-moving flashbacks, because the future is coming quickly, and things are unraveling fast.<br /><br />The Quarter Quell itself is of course the cornerstone of the film, the thing which would inevitably make or break it. Could the makers of the film get the characters of Joanna and Finnick right? Could they nail the puzzle of the arena and the traps it contains? Yes. Yes they did. I found myself willingly accepting the characters as they are introduced, and getting wrapped up in their fates all over again. And the conclusion...was perfect. And was handled in a way that only Jennifer Lawrence could make happen. She continues to carry the series.<br /><br />The first film had some CGI special effects and the sequel has more. The first film had action sequences and this film has more. The drama has been kicked up a notch (a bit cheesier or melodramatic for some people I am sure). There are more characters, and the characters we have are deeper. The dialog is better. The music is more cinematic. There is some gorgeously framed shots that are high class film-making. This is a film to see more than once in a theater.<br /><br />I watched the first film before reading the books. And I do not like the books. I never really wanted to own the first film though I have watched it several times and gotten a lot out of it. Now...<br /><br />I am glad the final book will be two films because the story needs time to unravel and have the required emotional impact. I'm not a fan of the books, but the first film was better than the book, the second film is even better than the first (and MUCH better than the book, which was my favorite of the series). I cannot wait to see what is done with the final two films, because while Katniss was an empty protagonist who stumbled her way through tumultuous times in the books, here she a complex character whose story is very gripping indeed. Bravo!alog is better. The music is more cinematic. There is some gorgeously framed shots that are high class film-making.

B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|I was sitting on the edge of my chair the whole time. I didn't want it to end. Looking forward to the next book.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Flowed nicely and I never was bored.  Not your typical ending.  I'm looking forward to reading more of her books.
B00E9A656K|5.0|Great graphics, fun game great way to pass the time and it's free. 2bad you have to spend $$ to get the upgrades and real high power for the cars.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I like to play angry birds.  A young person all the way to an old person would enjoy this game.  It is easy to play and a lot of fun.
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|It was a different kind of tale and presented in a unique and entertaining way.  Impressive house scenes. What the wealthy do for love???
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|If you like Uno, you definitely want this game.  I play it, my grandson plays it.  It is fun to play with other people and strategize. It keeps the mind working.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I'm waiting for the ability to stream local media to my tv through this device.  Then it will be perfect.
0525478817|4.0|It was recommended that I read The Fault in Our Stars by one of my co-workers, and it was so wonderful that I read it all in one night! I was initially off-put by the idea of reading a book in which the main character was a teen with cancer, but the book drew me in with the protagonist's (Hazel) witty character and unique voice. As Hazel's relationship grew with others in the book (particularly with cancer-ridden teen, Augustus), I was curious to see how this love story would play out. A plot twist left me dumb-founded and in tears. The story was beautifully written, and the ending was tragic and intense. If you plan on reading this book (and you should!), make sure you keep a box of Kleenex near you.
B0042TV4IC|5.0|Love it! This show is absolutely brimming with sweetness and reminds me of an elegant Little House. A must watch!
B00DWZHTOU|5.0|Bought 3 of these for Christmas presents, I actually found them slightly cheaper at walmart just after I had ordered these. O well.
B0083SBJXS|4.0|Pretty good movie although it could've been better if it wasn't about Ironman from beginning to end. Maybe Disney should get some new writers.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome both me and my 2 year old love it!  Best part is its free love the variety and different levels...definitely a favorite for my phone and kindle!
B0001IMCDE|1.0|My DVD doesn't even work, I wouldn't recommend buying it watch it on youtube or something. I threw this in my DVD player and not one sign of the movie appeared, I had the movie for like a few months and last night was my first time wanting to watch it.
1594744769|5.0|What a fantastic book! The author's haunting, found postcards are reproduced within the pages and the narrative builds the story around them. Even without the pictures it would be a wonderful tale of acceptance and adventure.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|In short this game is entertaining easy and truly free. Which for me is the reciepe for a great game. There are a few things I wished would change, for example if we can visit our friends house leave tips and give them gifts why can't we serve their food before it becomes spoiled? And visa versa? Overall a great game, I have played this game for a lot longer than another game of this type because it keeps it challenging its not the same old everyday.
0062060554|4.0|Gradually reveals the twists and turns behind an original premise. In hindsight you might say it was too pat or obvious but it makes for very good fun while reading.
B00F0O8SZK|4.0|Susan Boyle has a very good voice and I enjoy listening to her. I liked her first CD much more<br />than her current one.<br />This is her second Christmas CD.
0399162097|3.0|The whole revealed crucial plot point ended up being over worked. Ultimately I couldn't empathize and I think the author intended me to.
B001VB8UAE|5.0|Anything Streisand is my favorite. This concert is superb as she talks briefly<br />about her &#34;private&#34; life. The music she chose reflects her feelings about<br />each of the pieces. She loves playing to her audience. This concert<br />occurred several years ago. Her voice is strong and vibrant.
B007Z9QWVK|1.0|Preposterous and pretentious...and I'm a Madonna fan. Bad writing, bad acting, bad directing. Only the people playing Wallis and Edward do a decent acting job, but it's such a horrible script that two actors can't save it. Abbie Cornish playing the contemporary protagonist has one emotion during the whole thing.
B00FN3HRG4|5.0|Have waited almost a year to see and hear my favorite person. I have not seen the DVD yet<br />but eagerly look forward to listening to the CD.  Listened to the CD. It is<br />incredible. Her voice is strong and she is very cognizant of her audience and their<br />reactions. For you Baby Boomers out there who are fans, this is a must purchase.
030758836X|4.0|Frighteningly insightful about the deterioration of infatuation in a relationship. And a good mystery as well. Easy to imagine it as a movie with Ben Affleck and Naomi Watts.
B002LC8HF0|5.0|Well done and a fine wrap up. I was totally satisfied. I loved it and can find no flaw. Thank you Brandon.
0156034026|4.0|Short gem of a novel that gets you into the head of a Muslim in current world/American politics and prejudices.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|1) Excellent setup (almost excessively long showing of the 8mm film during the opening sequence).<br />2) Good use of audio to generate viewer discomfort.<br />3) An ending that could be seen coming from a mile away, but with no ability to stop it (it was obvious the characters were hosed from the moment the viewer recognized where the movie was headed).<br />4) Excellent use of Vincent D'Onofrio's signature character acting, without going over the top.
0307744434|5.0|One of my favorite books of the year. Makes one long to actually live in this world and visit this Circus. Very original and imaginative premise. Couldn't get enough of it. Rich storytelling and colorful characters.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I was incredibly disappointed by the third and final book. I did not feel like the ending was very well developed or matched the tone of the series up to that point. There were several issues that were never resolved and questions left unanswered. I was left regretting that I read the series at all!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Kinda a long download to to actually install the game but it was worth sitting threw this is an awesome game

B005LAII62|4.0|Strange how it used to be that computer-animated films were always a guarantee of quality. This trend seems to have petered off in recent years, with a range of mediocre studios capitalizing on the popularity of CG animation, but there is one art form that never fails to churn out top quality stories: stop-motion animation. Perhaps it's because of the pain-staking level of patience and detail that goes into each moment of screen-time: clearly the arists behind the visuals don't want to waste their time on anything other than the very best that storytellers have to offer.<br /><br />\\"ParaNorman\\" is best described as a comedy-horror, veering between the two genres with a range of funny gags and genuinely scary moments. Paying homage to B-grade horror films of the 1980s (including nods to [[ASIN:B003COE90S Friday the 13th]] and [[ASIN:B000FC2GA0 Halloween]]), the film also has plenty to say about the nature of fear and the devastating impact it can have on reason and compassion. By the end credits, I was surprised at how sophisticated the story and its message was, all in a film that ostensibly meant for children.<br /><br />Much like Haley Joel Osmond in [[ASIN:B00004BZIY The Sixth Sense]], Norman Babcock can see dead people. Unlike Haley Joel Osmond, Norman isn't afraid of them. In fact, it's the living that makes his life difficult, whether it's fending off bullies at school or coping with his own family's refusal to believe in his special gift. Such ostracization has left him withdrawn and reclusive, but he remains a gentle soul As his grandmother's ghost tells him: it's okay to be scared - as long as it doesn't change who he is.<br /><br />As it turns out, there's plenty to be afraid of.  Living in Blithe Hollow, a New England township whose tourist trade revolves around a dark history of witch trials, Norman has grown up with the story of a local witch whose curse on the Puritan judges that sentenced her to death promises that they'll one day rise on Halloween as the intruments of her revenge. That day appears to be swift-approaching, for Norman is having increasingly terrifying visions of the town's colonial past.<br /><br />Not only that, but he's being followed by the only other person in town deemed more crazy than him: his Uncle Prenderghast, who warns him that he's the only one who can keep the undead from rising. Together with a motley crew composed of his best (and only) friend Neil, his ditzy  sister Courtney, her would-be boyfriend Mitch and the local bully Alvin, Norman desperately searches for a way to keep the town safe - even if it means going up against angry mobs and grisly zombies.<br /><br />It's hard to talk about \\"ParaNorman\\" without giving away the surprise twist at its climax, one that really deserves to be watched without any spoilers. Suffice to say that it's the reason why ParaNorman is so memorable, making it far more complex than its initial dark comedy sequences would at first have you believe. Even as it pokes fun at horror movie clich&eacute;s, there is a very harrowing horror story at its core...one which demonstrates the fear and intolerance is a greater evil than any witch or zombie.<br /><br />With creative character designs and beautiful animation, \\"ParaNorman\\" is a great Halloween treat, very much in the spirit of [[ASIN:B0007939Q6 Scooby Doo]] or [[ASIN:B004JMY312 Hocus Pocus]], not to mention other stop-motion classics such as [[ASIN:B005ZMTYBY The Nightmare Before Christmas]] and [[ASIN:B002BWCJOA Coraline]]. Though some of the jokes might be a little more risque than parents are used to, and some of the scary sequences are pretty darn scary, \\"Paranorman\\" has all the potential to end up a classic.the intruments of her revenge.

He relates his book to many successful artists, provides \\"food for thought\\" quotes, and gives great tips to help expand the artist in us.<br /><br />The book is not written from a businessman's perspective. It's down-to-earth, like you're having a one-on-one conversation with the author.<br /><br />I had no trouble figuring the rating for this book. 5 out of 5 stars all day, every day.

I should tell you, I am someone who reads 2 books a month so this is odd for me. I then tried to listen to this book on tape. Awful! The narrator is fine, but dear god the language in this book is ultimately uncalled for. JK has an entire chapter dedicated to a teenage boy thinking about a porn he had watched... and detailed it. I think she was trying to be seductive but this book was a bore with disgusting, overly long, paragraphs of images even adults don't want to read about. I have read every other book she has written and wasn't as offended as this one. Stick to children's books my friend, you are just not cut out for adult novels.

B003XVYLDU|2.0|I have never read Vonnegut before this. I didn't really know what I was getting myself into, and I think that is why I did not enjoy this book as much as others. I was expecting something to happen, to learn about he Dresden bombing, and I really didn't. I waited 80% of the book for something that seemed like it could be anti-war, and then once I got to the last 20% I thought oh, okay. I see it now. I know it is satire, but I didn't see the anti-war message for most of the story.<br /><br />There were two things that annoyed me so much with the writing style in this book. First was the breaking up of the story into little tiny sections, only a few paragraphs long. I am not sure why the author did that, but they were not necessary. Most of the time you could have just read straight through multiple sections as one scene, but instead it was broken up into pieces. It felt like I had ADD or something, like the reader cannot focus for more than two seconds and drove me crazy. It kept me from really being able to get into the story since I had to pause every two seconds.<br /><br />The second things that annoyed me was the \\"So it goes\\" after anything, living or non, that dies. Campaign bubbles died, \\"So it goes\\". Person died, \\"So it goes\\". Anything dies, \\"So it goes\\". It was so repetitive and just annoyed me. I know he could have been trying to point out every time something dies so we really acknowledge it or something, but to me I just couldn't get pasted it. It was in the story over 100 times and it just drove me crazy.<br /><br />The story itself I was really confused by. The time travel, the aliens, the small snippets of what happened to Billy Pilgrim all just made me think okay...I didn't really like any of the characters in the story either. Billy was so passive with everything in his life he just kind of bumbled around doing nothing. It was just a strange story for me, but I didn't realize this going into it. I just knew it was about the Dresden bombing, and I was waiting the entire book for that to happen. It was an odd read, but I think I might give it another try in a little bit. I might enjoy it more now that I am not going in with the same expectations. Now that I know what I am getting into maybe it will be better. We shall see. Such an odd book.<br /><br />This review was originally posted to [...]waiting the entire book for that to happen. It was an odd read, but I think I might give it another try in a little bit.

B00BD99JMW|3.0|As whole the book was good. I loved the ending. Having the two perspectives threw me off because both Tobias and Tris &#34;sounded&#34; the same. I actually got confused in one of the chapters because I thought it was Tris's perspective, but it was actually from Tobias'! I understand why she had both, but it could have been written a lot better. The story of the the GDs and GPs was a bit confusing and kind of boring. I was expecting something more dramatic. I do love the story line of all characters and the relationship that they built.<br /><br />I could see the movie being really bad. Hopefully Tris' character does not come off annoying like the girl from Twilight.

The story grabs you and pulls you in to the very last page. If you are looking for a very good thriller then I suggest that you read this story.  Even though it is fiction it gives you a glimpse into the past of Mississippi. This story will make you laugh and shed some tears.  I hope that you read it and enjoy it as much as I did.

B003UBTX72|5.0|'The Five String Addict': A Guitarist's Review of Keith Richards' Life Memoir<br /><br />In Keith Richards' memoir, Life, the Rolling Stone guitarist rocks readers along his lifelong journey that began on December 18, 1943. Life chronicles Richards's career with the Rolling Stones since 1962 and tracks them from small clubs to massive arena concerts. Expected are the Rolling Stone drug induced antics, sexual escapades, and belligerent disregard toward authority. According to Richards, \\"If you're going to kick authority in the teeth, you might as well use two feet.\\"<br /><br />Unexpected is Keith's ability to recall detailed minutiae such as the precise amount of money the Stones were paid for their very first gig in London; it turns out that Keith maintained a thorough diary. The Stones guitarist is articulate and well narrated with the assistance of James Fox. Particularly enjoyable was the description of how he came up with possibly the most iconic tune of all time, \\"Satisfaction,\\" literally while he slept!<br /><br />Keith Richards' contribution and historical importance as a guitarist and songwriter cannot be overestimated. Life details Keith's love of music, his guitar playing style and chord construction techniques. More specifically Life delves into how Keith attains his unique signature sound and more importantly describes how his desire to imitate banjos from the old American south led him to remove the low \\"E\\" string and tune his guitar to an open \\"G.\\"<br /><br />As a guitarist, retuning the instrument creates a discovery world since structured chords and scales are no longer applicable. This tuning was used to create archetypal Stones classics. Keith stated, \\"With the five-string it was just like turning a page; there's another story. And I'm still exploring. With five strings you can be sparse; that's your frame, that's what you work on. 'Start Me Up,' 'Can't You Hear Me Knocking,' 'Honky Tonk Women,' all leave gaps between the chords.\\"<br /><br />Guitarists who cover Rolling Stones songs with a standard tuning know something's wrong, that an element is amiss. Altering to Keith's open \\"G\\" tuning makes songs such \\"Can't You Hear Me Knocking\\" simple to play. To tune the guitar like Keith, remove the low \\"E\\" string and tune the 5th string from \\"A\\" to \\"G\\" and the high \\"E\\" string to \\"D,\\" permitting the fifth tone to ring through, creating Keith's inimitable sound.<br /><br />Even with Keith's tuning and equipment, the feel is all important. Richard's says, \\"Music is a language that doesn't speak in particular words. It speaks in emotions, and if it's in the bones, it's in the bones.\\" Keith also feels that beginning guitarists should learn on acoustic instruments. He states, \\"I firmly believe if you want to be a guitar player, you better start on acoustic and then graduate to electric. Don't think you're going to be Townshend or Hendrix just because you can go wee wee wah wah, and all the electronic tricks of the trade.\\"<br /><br />Keith gave prudent advice to songwriters. \\"To write a song that is remembered and taken to heart,\\" Richards notes, \\"is a connection, a touching of bases.\\" He added, \\"Sometimes I think songwriting is about tightening the heartstrings as much as possible without bringing on a heart attack.\\"<br /><br />Richards' outlook on life is quite positive. He has outlived doctors that gave him six months to live and understandably no longer trusts medical professionals. He quips, \\"It's really good to be here and as I always say, it's really good to be anywhere!\\" When questioned about the Stones longevity he replied, \\"You've got the sun, you've got the moon, and you've got the Rolling Stones.\\"<br /><br />This comprehensive book is recommended to Rolling Stones fans, guitarists, musicians, and individuals who enjoy well written non-fiction novels. Of the dozen non-fiction musician books that I have read over the past three years, the memoir Life is hands down my favorite.<br /><br />About the Review: GeorgeRajna, M.B.A., Masters of Science in Communications Disorders, is a bilingual speech therapist who has traveled to over one hundred countries across six continents. He composes music on the guitar and ukulele, and spent two years working in rural education for Peace Corps Paraguay. He is the co-author of Traveling in Sin. Since July 2012, George and Lisa have been living abroad in Southeast Asia follow their journey at We Said Go Travel.<br /><br />This article first appeared in the Huffington Post:<br />[...]

B00DG292SK|3.0|George wrote about this book for the Huffington Post:<br /><br />\\"Who Am I\\" is legendary The Who composer and guitarist Pete Townshend's autobiographic memoir that he began in May, 1996. The original manuscript was 1,000 pages long but editor Harper Collins shaved it in half to 500 pages. The chronicle delves into Townshend's upbringing in England, explains the development of The Who, and later probes into Townshend's struggles as a rock star as he battles with drugs, alcohol and fidelity.<br /><br />Pete Townshend's memoir opens with his childhood in London that immediately followed World War II in May 1945. He lived with his grandmother who allegedly sexually and mentally tormented Townshend based on his limited childhood recollections. His childhood \\"issues\\" reappear during Townshend's memoir with alarming frequency.<br /><br />2013-11-18-whoami.jpg<br /><br />Townshend's stage antics developed primarily by accident and imitation. He claims, \\"I started smashing his guitars at the end of performances after accidentally pushing one through a club ceiling in 1964 and damaged it.\\" When the fans went wild, he adopted it into his performance which later led Keith Moon to topple over his drum kit and trash hotels. Townshend admits that his trademark \\"windmill\\" style of strumming guitar chords was espoused from Keith Richards who warmed-up by swinging his arm prior to going on stage. He explains that music he heard in his head as a child affected his music, eventually developing into rock operas such as Tommy and Quadrophenia.<br /><br />Townshend's sexuality was often probed throughout his book. He describes himself as bisexual because of a sexual encounter with a male journalist and his sexual interest in Mick Jagger. The other The Who members were so disgusted with Townshend's lack of sexual prowess that they paid a prostitute to infect him with gonorrhea. Distancing himself from life as a rock star, he studied under Indian guru Meher Baba. While under Baba's tutelage, Townshend avoided drugs and adultery but he periodically descended into the world of drugs, alcohol and female lovers.<br /><br />Life after The Who led to Townshend's employment as an editor at Faber and Faber where he commissioned literature and began philanthropic charity work including the establishment of a shelter for battered wives. His charitable work led to problems and Townshend was arrested for supposedly downloading child-pornography. Townshend explained that he was fighting child-pornography by setting up a research program support system for survivors of childhood abuse. He was given a formal police caution because Townshend \\"was in no frame of mind to live through another eternity - this time in court.\\" He later wished he had gone to trial to prove his innocence.<br /><br />Townshend's insightful autobiography is worthwhile in how it accounts his creative process in creating music. This memoir is comprehensive, intimate, and candid. The memoir uniquely explores deeply into Townshend's mental state and psyche. He exposes his defects as an angry guitar hero, delves into his mind as an introspective composer, and contrasts the segment of his being that is a spiritual seeker versus the hedonistic drug user that he returned to often. At times Townshend appears tortured, unable to cope with life as he searches for something beyond his reach.<br /><br />Even though the memoir was chopped in half, book editing was uneven at times, with either too much detail or choppy incomplete narrative. His intellectual tone lacked exuberance and created a dull narrative while he crams too much down the reader's throat. This chronicle is recommended exclusively to dedicated hard-core Pete Townshend fans that will appreciate every minute detail that he does an impressive job of recalling. However, even die-hard The Who fanatics would be better off reading a The Who biography than sitting through an opera when you really wanted to listen to classical music.<br /><br />About this review: George Rajna, MBA, MS Communications Disorders, is a bilingual speech therapist who has traveled to 100 countries across six continents.

B0083GQKQG|5.0|This movie was one of the best phsycological thrillers I have ever seen. This kid is gonna be one of the greatest actors of our generation.
B0094LYBT2|5.0|Powerful message.  Another decent movie from the Kendrick brothers.  I'm looking forward to the next project from the producers of this movie.
B00EVW0SA0|2.0|I like a good shoot em up, blow em up, battle the bad guys kinda movie. This one has so many technical errors that it was distracting. The details are important in making a movie like this work. The special affects were cheesy in parts. Finally, the little girl is so incredible unlikeable and annoying as to turn it off for a while. Meaning that if I were in a theater and dropped $10.00 on this film I'd have walked out. She's a miserable shrew and it never stops.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|The greatest album of all time. No questions asked. One of the best two ways to spend 43 minutes of your life.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is a lot of fun.  Not for the littlest ones, but the 6 and over kids should love it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thought this was an awesome book.  I couldn't put it down and I was completely taken from the beginning. Can't wait to read the others.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Simply excellent in her delivery of the songs on this CD.  My first purchase of Norah, and I'm a big fan.  Love the raspy, folksy voice.  Simply marvelous.
B00GLX1MG6|4.0|Really dumb plot, but entertaining and light. If you cant find anything else, this is an ok one to pass the time.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Clear, crisp picture and it's just like seeing them all for the first time. The perfect format for any Star Wars fan ond something I'll hold onto long after the newer ones come out!!
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|How did I get into this mess? Miles isn't even here<br />...and done!<br /><br />As for review: this is a book about Ivan Vorpatril - if you don't know who Ivan is, go get a book from Bujold's Vor-saga - it's one of the best space opera/comedy out there. If you do know Ivan, then you don't need another reason to buy it - because everybody loves Ivan (if you don't like Ivan then you are probably a heartless Cetagandian).<br />Alliance is a romantic comedy/adventure, a bit like Civil Campaign, except without Miles, who makes only a brief appearance, but with a lot of other familiar characters from Byerly to Gregor. Includes bounty hunters, renegade Jacksonians, hidden treasures and a lot of Ivan. The only disadvantage that it's too short.
B00FXMGI0G|5.0|The RED gang pleased us again.  Flat love the concept and execution, pardon the pun, of this movie!  Everyone clicks to create a fine experience for the viewers.
B005K17RU0|5.0|always on and accurate. my family travels a lot and its great to have all the locations at my fingertips to check on the weather.
B008LXZEYU|1.0|Horrible. If you like laughing at stupid Light Beer commercials then this steaming pile of elephant dung is for you.
B009NF54ZE|4.0|I think it was a good game  just a little too repeatitive.  I did enjoy the hidden object needs to have more items to find
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I avoided this game for months and months - I've seen the zombification effect its addictively simple, yet challenging, gameplay had on my friends... and then, one night, down at my uncle and aunt's place... my aunt insisted I get her past a difficult level...<br /><br />and I was done.
B0026KX6TY|4.0|Without a doubt one of my all-time favorite movies.  Excellent script and beautiful cinematography.  Completely engrossing from beginning to end.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|who doesnt love facebook lol even those that say they dont secretly do ha ha ha its a great way to share info and life events i will admit some people share a lil too much lol
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|A lot of great songs on this one with catchy melodies. The first couple songs are fast paced fun, Sexx Dreams and Do What You Want have great beats to them, and Dope is one of the best ballads I've heard all year. I sprung for the actual CD version, the artwork is great, the text on the cover (Lady Gaga ARTPOP) glistens in the light, which is good.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|A game with a story - enjoyed playing it - some parts were more challenging than others but never frustrating
B00CFYAT6O|4.0|The ensemble band of Derek and Susan's newest release.  Good songs with enough of Derek's guitar the satisfy.  Good Stuff!
B009V5KI98|1.0|This was NOT HD. Terrible quality. We have purchased other old movies from Amazon Instant in the past and had great success, but the quality of Annie was big let down. All fuzzy and terrible sound quality. Save your $!
0061564893|5.0|An interesting take on the discovery of the new world before Columbus made his trip 70+ years later.  Worth a read.
B003G4W49C|3.0|The Author is SOOOOOO off the wall and the story is hard to follow, even after seeing the movie.  I did not care for it at all!
B000058983|5.0|I had always wondered about the mystic of Love.  Hearing they were on par with the other psychedelic bands of San Francisco.  It is good, but not as good as say Jefferson Airplane, Jimi, The Beatles, etc.  Interesting though.
B004VOBIE8|5.0|better pricing and fast shipping.what ever I want when ever I want Also every thing I needs that good bussiness to do with BE
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I loved this book. I enjoyed reading the book from the child's point of view. At times I felt as if I was in the Room with them. I wish the book was longer.
B00CKJ2KK2|1.0|Game will not connect to the online so can't play always fails to connect will be deleting it from my device and don't recommend this to anyone
030758836X|3.0|I reserved this from the library after seeing it on a WTF list. (I also added Chuck Palahniuk's RANT, which I got bored with and quit, and Herman Koch's THE DINNER, which I thoroughly enjoyed.)<br /><br />Most of my Goodreads friends gave five stars. I don't trust other people to enjoy what I enjoy, so I was sceptical. If this wasn't an OMG-amazing novel, I would judge my friends for it, not the author.<br /><br />And thus GONE GIRL is a victim of its own hype. It's been so buzzed to the extent that it was never going to live up to the expectation of greatness.<br /><br />Gillian Flynn has a witty way with words, and certainly doesn't hold back on creating grotesque characters. Her social commentary is clever: everything from \\"Cool Girl\\" to public perception. And how at the start of a relationship each party pretends to be what the other wants, and the charade disappears the longer they remain. But alongside the awful people doing awful things is Margo, who's a beacon of awesome in all her scenes. She's definitely more likeable than the leading couple, who prove that terrible people belong together.<br /><br />Some say Nick and Amy are just as bad as each other. You know those stalker \\"romances\\" in which the possessiveness and obsession creeps you out? The Dunnes are like that, but at least they're honest enough to admit that their bond is unhealthy, and Nick really does want to escape. Only he can't because of blackmail and whatever else his conniving wife could do to him next. His complicity annoys, but Amy's doubtlessly the more evil. The ending was bound to irk unless one or both of them died. 'Til death do us part, indeed.<br /><br />In short, had it not been super-hyped, I probably would've given four stars, but it loses a mark for disappointment. It's far from a bad book, and is sure to spark lively discussion. Don't know how the film will fare, if viewers go in already knowing the twist, though.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Allegiant is a far cry from the quality of Divergent and Insurgent. The characters lack emotion and passion, particularly Tris and Four. The suspense falls flat at every turn. This is the book when the reader finds out about the truth of the factions and what is outside the fence, I would hope that it would be an exciting and climactic build-up but no, the truth is just plopped on your lap and you think, that's it?? The plot lopped along to the point of boredom and by the end I could really care less what happened, in fact I let a fellow reader spill the beans so I get it over with. Overall, this book had no feeling, its like Ms. Roth was rushed and pressured to complete the series but wasn't given the time or creative freedom to make it better.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I have been a long time kindle user and have several hundred books through Amazon.<br />I started with the second generation kindle and for the past 4 years starting using the kindle app for android.<br />Until recently there was never more than minor bugs, that were fixed within a week or so.<br /><br />Now whenever I open a book I get the following message -<br /><br />&#34;Invalid Item<br />please remove the item from your device and go to all items to download it again.&#34;<br /><br />I remove & reload the book in question only to get the same message when i try again.<br /><br />Since there is no support options that get a response I am forced to dig out my kindle which has been unused for the past 2 years.<br />Here is your one star Amazon, maybe you will try to fix this issue, before I start to convert my existing collection and look elsewhere for a reading platform
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|So moving and a must read. Beautifully written and expressive. Gives life and relationships  a deeper meaning. Great read for all.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Loved the story and writing style. This is the first WWII story I can recall from the perspective of the &#34;other side.&#34;
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|this is the best game on planet earth that is if you like iron man. the controls are sensetive. I don't know how it only got 4 stars I give it 5 stars because it is awesome
1452115567|3.0|I had seen some earlier pictures, in a national publication, which made me buy the book. Mattie is certainly a great looking Coon Hound, but after looking through the book a couple of times, it is diffidently a coffee table book and not much else. I was disappointed in the quality of the pictures and many had sun glare. The best picture was not included in this book. You have to imagine Mattie sitting a booth in a rural coffee shop, with a coffee cup in front of her and she is doing a very large yawn at the same time
B003VANOFY|1.0|It's true, I hate this headset. I've loved most Logitech products I've bought and I've bought a lot!<br />This headset has been nothing but trouble since day two. (Worked great on day one.) Ever since I've experienced:<br />-connectivity issues<br />-poor sound quality issues<br />-surround not working properly<br />Now it's completely dead. Two computers won't recognize the dongle let alone allow the headset to connect.<br />I now own an expensive Logitech paperweight.
B005EHILV4|5.0|Easy to use with a good quality. I use to have the previous version with a separate USB interface and a separate AC so now it's much more easy to plug one USB cable et you're good to go.
B003B02O7I|3.0|This book  had a very heavy Christian theme. Also, it did not feel as if any characters were even remotely redeeming until at least the middle of the book.  The second half did get better, but not enough to recommend.  I also found the ending rather sad.  I haven't read a Grisham book in years, but I remember those earlier works to be quite good.  I plan to try other newer ones.
B000F8O35U|5.0|Great price for a collector's item!! I searched for this movie for months and month when I was a child, now I can rest assured that my children will have the two disc edition in the future!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This is a great game. I've played it for three months now and it is still fun. Buy it right now. Totally worth a dollar, and entertaining for hours. It's a strategy game that's entertaining, but difficult (on brutal). I am planning  to get Necroa and Neurax Worm.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|its great game great to make different families and take care of them and play games. collect money and feed families. and visit friends
0307476073|5.0|I love this book!  Candidly, the reader travels with Cheryl Strayed through her inner journey as well as journey on the trail.  Inspiring!
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Great!!!! It's lots of fun...and comes close to the same entertainment I use to get whenever I played Mario brothers....very addictive...
B00555X8OA|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a very long time, completely changed my patterns of thinking, I would recommend to any fan of economic non-fiction.
B00BGV0Y26|4.0|Great album, love the songs and Lzzy Hale is my biggest celebrity crush! Love her voice and love her band.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game ever its just missing 1 thing more mobs (not mods) and a larger world but yes this is coooooooooooooooool
B00CZAYL76|5.0|This is unique album with all the guests they have and just another great album by a truly god like band!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love it.  it's a good game to play makes you think of the Mario brothers and I can even let my nieces and nephews play
0930289234|5.0|I have not read a comic / graphic novel for years. I was absolutely delighted when I found this gem. A comic book for gronn ups, with very well-rounded characters and a very engaging story line. I thought that the ending was a bit weak compared to the high level the graphic novel had set previously in therms of realism. Otherwsie 100% recommended.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The characters are really cool and the places are amazing also the graphics on the game<br /><br />  THE GAME IS AWESOME
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Update this app on a more timely basis,  I don't understand how one of the wealthiest companies in the Internet,  can't hire a team to approve updated apps?
B005FVNIW6|5.0|This is an amazing book. The author takes you on a space ride unlike any other. I couldn't stop reading.
B008NMT684|5.0|Another winner from Pixal Envision.  I buy the add ons.  Hours of play for my toddler and it helps him with shape recognition like any puzzle.
B005IYNQAY|4.0|It's very hard being the second book after enders game. I believe this book tries hard, and is great. But reading them on after the other it can't quite reach the same heights as the first.
B00FAIPDAE|4.0|The game is easy to play, has fun characters and you don't have to spend any money if you don't want to.  I haven't had any trouble with crashes or errors.
B005COO1X6|4.0|I rated this one a four because it could have been better but for a short story by the &#34;master of horror&#34; it held my interest and it wasn't predictible. If I had to do it over, I'd buy it again!
B0043JDUNS|4.0|Not great art, but fun. It is like the cartoons of my childhood, with action for kids and risqu&eacute; asides for the adults. Some of the violence is a bit harsh for the ten year old I was watching it with. Or, so I thought.  He didn't seem bothered.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is awesome. You get to buy, upgrade, and fight with your own robot. It is easy and very addictive.
B000BNWU18|5.0|Actually, I have mixed feelings.  The third-party that sold it through Amazon deserves a high score.  They promptly sent it and the price (used) was great.  ........................  The book itself:  &#34;The Elements of Style&#34; is regarded as The Bible within the writers' critique group I attend.  I bought this to give to new members.  However, this particular edition is OLD.  It has a 1959 copyright date and is the 16th printing.  Strunk & White didn’t come out with a newer edition until 1972.  I'd like to think the English Language hasn't changed much since 1972.  My sense is that the authors have now discovered they can make more money if they can create a new edition every year.  AND there's now several different editions coming out at the same time, depending on the author combination.  We can find one by Strunk & White, one by Strunk; another by White.  Do they not agree or something???  I think the son of one of them is also selling his own version.  What worries me is that these experts are rewriting the rules just so they can sell more books.  I hate it that the rules I learned in elementary school are no longer the latest “fashion.”  As a related note, I find it embarrassing that it's Possible for someone to get a college degree in English.  Worse yet, some people have earned multiple PhD degrees in just our one language.  Let's compare that to Korean, where by the end of second grade, children have learned everything there is to know about their language and they can then use their time to learn other things--math, science; other languages.  Here in America, college graduates still haven't learned English adequately.  SO, &#34;The Elements of Style&#34; and its annual updates suggests the whole book is obsolete unless we're always buying the latest model--We can't trust the older versions.
B00G4EXNNM|5.0|Great music! A perfect way to get away from those dreary 'new' songs. I love Billie's voice sooooo much, gonna listen to this album whenever I am driving.
B005HSL626|3.0|It's funny but sure fun with your finger. But after finished game and an ad appeared. I turn off WiFi in my kindle fire so ad can't appear in game again.
B000FA675C|4.0|They could have just put the cryptex in a freezer, waited until the vinegar froze, and sawed it, removed the paper carefully and that's it! was I the only one who thought about this? Seriously it didn't let me read comfortably, I was all the time like &#34;Why they don't just freeze it? It's just liquid inside!!&#34;<br /><br />Another thing, if Sir Leigh Teabing told Silas to enter Chateau Villete and take the cryptex, why did he hit knock him down when Silas did as he was bid? It is just illogical and unjustified in the book.
B000VM9Z8K|3.0|i have read many of her books, and this one is just as fast. i didn't like the love story as much as others, but the learning about the main character's life while she does was fun and believable.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Sean,<br />I cannot begin to tell you how much I appreciated your writing. The life of Nicola Tesla is definitely a testimony of endurance and tenacity. His willingness to grow is an inspiration and so is your book about him.  I look forward to reading more of your books in my journey to discovery. Thank you!
B0033H7VI6|5.0|After watching all the youtube vids on this I finaly decided to see what the craze was all about and buy one. This knife is awsome. flat grind, finger choil, 1095, agressive jimping, oh and the best part is its 1/4 inch thick. The only thing it needs is a pummle on the bottom of the handle. Easy fix by taking off the rubber scales and cutting them down a bit. For the price you won't think twice about beating the mess out of it. And oh yes it can take it.
B009AMANBA|5.0|A glimpse, hopefully an accurate one, into the day to day struggles of Americas greatest president, during the most critical period of American history,  speaks for itsel why the film deserves 5 stars.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|&quot;Minion rush is like temple run but, there's nothin better for the minions than gettin a good exercise&quot; &quot;run minions run&quot;. If your board just download minion rush.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Wonderful novel of a small village girl attempting to survive the horrors of Nazi Germany.  Love the way the book is written.  Made me think...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so awesome my mom has it on her phone I'd delete temple run and download subway surfers :-)
B007EE4XKI|3.0|Unusual back story on Data and his creator/father.  This book works best with Trekkies...er....Trekkers.  Already knowing who the characters are, let's the ready dive right in...
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|this is a game I can see myself wasting hours on. haven't played dh since I was a kid, very happy to see it on the app store.
B00G9U7R2O|1.0|We couldn't watch the video as it would only load a few minutes and then shut down, we finally gave up.
B00FLDG52I|5.0|EC and the gang do it again! I have love the Crossroads festival outtakes over the years and had to get this DVD/CD combo asap. I wasn't disappointed
B002E0JL4A|5.0|I enjoyed seeing the impact of compassion on peoples lives.  I recommend watching Patch Adams TED talk and researching his life to get a more accurate and amazing story.
B00FLDG5AA|5.0|EC and the gang do it again! I have love the Crossroads festival outtakes over the years and had to get this DVD/CD combo asap. I wasn't disappointed.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|This CD has a lot of songs that have received air time. Well worth the investment and LOVED the song choices on this CD
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|So much fun I have not done anything for like 3 hours so addicting but really fun best app ever
B000UVT3OI|5.0|Great CD and DVD. Lots of fun to listen to and watch. I play it often. Timeless songs and good quality CD recordings
B009LDD4V4|5.0|We all know that the Bones series is fantastic. I ordered my 8th season and got it within two (2) days. It came surprizing quick and packaged well. Amazon is great when it comes to speed and packaging.
B004JN1D2I|3.0|Stopped in the middle of reading book three.<br />I found I didn't care what happened to most of the characters and the couple that I did just didn't show up often enough to hold my attention.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy that Candy Crush is now on my Kindle!!! My favorite game!!! And it updates along with my Android!!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I cried so bad on the first time I watched it. I have watched this movie for almost 30 times and I somehow haven't got bored of it(usually I feel bored after watching a movie for like 3 times)!! It is so goooooooooooooooooooood!!!
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|What makes this story so amazing is the youth of Malala along with her supportive family, especially her father. The co-author of the book is also to be commended. I found it hard to put the book down.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Really fun game because you can create anything to help solve a problem. To get to high places I recommend a Pegasus. Hope this helped.
048622709X|5.0|Very nice book used for art class. Helps a lot and will study for a long time to come using this book!  Has a huge array of drawings to learn from and advise.  An artist's favorite actually.  Came in good condition and from a trustworthy courteous seller too. Always a plus to deal with joyous, kind, courteous sellers who actually care about you.
B00FAIPDAE|1.0|I uninstalled the game.. Install it back...All my Data is gone. BOo I just got Into a legion.<br /><br />Overall good.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|dissapointing.  I expected a LOT more apps to support this by now.  Poor effort Google  &#34;its only $35!&#34;  only gets you so far.
1401937268|5.0|I love the Doreen Virtue/Radleigh Valentine Angel Tarot card deck.  The cards are very positive and the photos are beautiful as well.
B00G4EXNNM|5.0|This album is an absolute masterpiece.  I am 28 and grew up listening to the oldies and absolutely love the Everly Brothers.  I must admit that I am also a huge Green Day fan.  I never really got into the Americana and folk genres, but that has not changed thanks to &#34;Foreverly.&#34;<br /><br />Billie and Norah's voice blend beautifully together.  While I don't know that anybody will ever be able to match the brilliant harmonies of the Everly Brothers, I actually believe that &#34;Foreverly&#34; hits the nail on the head even more than &#34;Songs Our Daddy Taught Us.&#34; I saw this because there is something that the mature voices of Billie and Norah combined with the dark arrangements of the songsadd to the bigger picture of the album...which is the incredibly dark lyrics.  When I went back and listened to the Everly Brothers album, it sounded like young adults singing about all this stuff that they were too young to experience.  With &#34;Foreverly,&#34; you truly get the feeling that Billie and Norah are feeling the pain described in the lyrics.  A lot of the songs actually work a lot better with the male/female arrangement.<br /><br />The closing track, Put My Little Shoes Away, is the standout of the album for me.  It is by far the most simple arrangement on the album, with only a minnimal piano accompiament, but the vocals and lyrics are so incredibly powerful.<br /><br />I am so happy that Billie decided to pursue this project and very happy that he tapped Norah to be his duet partner.  Just as he &#34;stumbled upon&#34; the old Everly Brother's album, he has helped me to stumble upon a genre that I really had no interest in prior to &#34;Foreverly.&#34;
B00APUYWYA|4.0|It was an ok and entertaining movie that I watched with my girlfriend. She liked it and I also enjoyed it. Its not a movie that will win awards or anything so I didn't give it 5 stars, but still a good movie overall.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I've enjoyed Mr. Grisham's work for 20+ years and this is another good one.  The greedy family members who come out of the woodwork and especially THE GREEDY LYING BASTARD LAWYERS really make your blood boil. I've unfortunately had to deal with subhuman, excrement filled, do anything for money, prostituting lawyers just like them. Anyway thanks for a great read Mr. Grisham.
B0000CFW87|3.0|Most of his songs sound the same, but I love his voice.  Sound quality was good.  I am not a big fan, but it is something different.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Worth the money get it now! It's awesome ! Get get get get it so awesome  to notch must get it now
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I can't quit playing!  The graphics are awesome and I'm ready to explore all of it! This game is very addictive!!!  :)
B008BIZ06M|4.0|Several great songs, and a few truly awful. &#34;Cruising California&#34; is ridiculous & terrible. &#34;Secret Family&#34; is the one that gets stuck in my head that I enjoy. &#34;OC Guns&#34; gets stuck in my head an annoys me.
1589946006|5.0|These are the figures that come with the Call of Cthulhu LCG.  They are REALLY cool.  These are small, but pretty solid and durable.  The bag has both sizes of figure (regular and tiny)  The tiny figures are good for game markers, but the bigger ones - regular size for the game - have SO MANY applications.  Your imagination is the only limit to what fun you can have with these.  Great for Cultists in Cubicles!  A good counterpoint to dashboard religious icons!  Party favors for your next Cult Gathering!  Get a bag of these and let the madness begin!!!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham is masterful in this work. One is so caught up in who will prevail in this will contest that the hints of history are almost overlooked....then ole Grisham as sleuthful as ever appears. It's movie worthy.
B00ENTDDGW|3.0|I think this game is super fun lost of people do .I think you should get this game it is awesome!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|LOVE the three match games -- this one is really fun!  It has extra &#34;helpers&#34; you can collect that help.  Great game.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|It was a great series and I'm happy with the ending. I would definitely recommend it ti anyone who likes female leads who can kick ass:)
1587143879|5.0|What can I tell you, the previous version read like stereo instructions.  This version is much easier to understand, is laid out better and is what I would call truly entry level Network Tech.  I will however mention this, yes you can get your CCENT with this book (1st book) , but I would recommend classroom instruction if you never have had networking certifications before or a limited understanding of Networking.  If you have had networking certifications, pay special attention to IPv6 in this book and you probably could just do a boot-camp.  You can take ICDN1 and ICDN2 or you can take the CCNA composite test that is up to you.
B0048KXRR6|5.0|Beautiful movie....Must see for all families! Shipping was fast and package was great! This movie is our sons favorite..Plus the first one too!
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|Entertaining with standard action expected, not the best Bond movie I've seen. The movie lack the uniqueness of previous Bond movies.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|As in all Grisham's books, the characters became real people to me. I waited for months for this book to be released and it was worth the wait.
B006DGOV9Q|5.0|Untill now it is exactly the same than my old and original one of my Samsung Galaxy SII. I had no problems till now and I have got it for more than 3 weeks.
034580404X|3.0|I've gone through 1 1/2 books of the 3 book trilogy.  It started out interesting enough, but now it's become rather boring and repetitive.  Just Mr. Grey and Anastasia in various situations where you know what the outcome will be.  I'll keep plodding along and see if it gets better later on.  Trying to get my money's worth after I paid so much for the books!
B004JHYRP4|5.0|I have read other works from Isaac Asimov, and &#34;The Gods Themselves&#34; is another interesting read.  I purchased the Kindle Edition and will be able to read and reread it at my convenience.  It is well worth the price paid.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is probably the best horse racing game I have found and it is pretty awesome and I have a good dealing that I will be playing it a lot more often.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|A pretty good look at real life and what is possible (maybe probable is a better word) out there in real life. Denzel was excellent as usual!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It's like playing a slot machine - not much thinking goes into it. You are at the mercy of the games programming.
B005ZV8Q2S|5.0|Just some good ol' comedy, we all need a belly laugh once in a while! Good way to spend a couple of hours.
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|Unable to watch this movie on Apple TV. Ended up renting it from Uverse.  Disappointed that Amazon is charging for an unmatched movie.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Amazed at how Marvel studio has presented Thor in the big screen. I was a fan of the comic book now I'm a fan of the movie.
B004EPZ084|5.0|I bought this movie not knowing if I would like it but Jennifer Aniston does a really good job! Kevin Spacey really cracked me up too! It has a lot of laughs!
1939416205|2.0|Interesting story, but I couldn't get past the really bad editing. Word flower for flour, waist for waste, on and on, I just couldn't take it anymore. Can't anyone edit anymore?
B00DHHRG46|5.0|BEAUTIFUL!  Loving the sounds of these two - are they lovers?  The music is so romantic and nice.  String teacher and can't live without this.
B000NZQL5U|4.0|This is a out-or-print Bon Jovi japanese remastered limited release which comes with a 2 cd set. This is Bon Jovi at their matured stage as songwriters and musicians.<br /><br />Disc 1 Contains the normal remastered 12 track album. (the remastered 2010 special edition album has better sound)<br /><br />Disc 2 Contains 9 track album which has the following tracks: 1) Keep the faith Live in Count Basie Theater 1992 ; 2) In These Arms Live In Count Basie Theater 1992; 3) I Believe Live In Count Basie Theater 1992; 4) I'll Sleep When I'm Dead Live In Milton Keynes 1993; 5) I'll Sleep When I'm Dead Live In Wembley 1995; 6) Bed Of Roses (Acoustic Version); 7) Cama De Rosas (Spanish Version); 8) Save A Prayer (Bonus Track for Japan) & 9) Starting All Over Again (Bonus Track for Japan).<br /><br />NOTE:<br />Now, i was so excited getting this but it wasn't brand new when i received it, it was cleaned and rewrapped...This is a great album version to get but the only downside to it is that many sellers may or may not be selling totally 'Brand new' ones. This is a rare and out-of-print album so before you buy this from any seller ask first if it is brand new. If it arrives and it is not, then it is hard to tell whether there are really anymore brand new ones available in the market.
B00GHJ6BJW|2.0|I will start off by saying that I like &#34;Do What You Want,&#34; &#34;Venus,&#34; and &#34;Swine,&#34; in particular. All terrific.<br /><br />That said, I was overwhelmed by the album. Gaga's pretensions to art sounds like a cool idea. I like the idea of Gaga bringing some of her terrific visual and performance hutzpah to her album. Unfortunately, that's just not the case here. It's just another batch of sex and celebrity obsessed trash tunes, which I love and which would be fine, except the quality is not up to par here. The heavy, pounding production doesn't do the music any favors either. I had to take a break halfway through because it was simply too grating on my ears. I'm also tired of the celebrity navel gazing, self-absorption-is-the-same-thing-as-depth attitude in her music. She's an intelligent woman and she is capable of better writing. I thought one song sounded like a satire of the overprivileged white girl &#34;I'm so fab, check it out, I'm blonde, I'm rich, and I'm a little bit of a bitch....this card can hold my black card and tiara....just ask your gay friends their advice, before you get a spray tan on holiday, in Taipei.&#34; Then, I looked at the track name and it said &#34;Donatella.&#34; So Gaga is making fun of Donatella Versace? Oh wait, it's supposed to be an homage?....yeah...not a very flattering portrait.<br /><br />Gaga is a seriously talented performer. The Fame and The Fame Monster included some of the best pop music of the past 10 years. Born This Way, too. Aside from &#34;Swine,&#34; Artpop never reaches those heights. It's not bad, but the concept comes across as pandering rather than serious, the themes aren't anything new, and the hooks simply aren't as memorable as previous works. On the bright side, it'll be easy for Gaga to outdo herself in 1-2 years when she records her next album.
B000AAP7BM|5.0|This album won the Latin Grammy Award for Best Ranchero Album at the Latin Grammy Awards of 2005 and also the Grammy Award for Best Mexican/Mexican-American Album.<br /><br />Definitely one of the finest work of singer Luis miguel besides his romances albums.<br /><br />This diamond edition has a bonus dvd disc 2 which contains some music videos from Mexico en la piel. Disc 1 has two bonus tracks 1) Por Un Amor  & 2) Mi Ciudad.<br />The bonus tracks are excellent songs on par with the rest of the album. No wonder this album Won Grammy awards!<br /><br />Luis Miguel's golden voice brings these mariachi classics to life in a new and fresh way..If you haven't got this, then you are missing out on a 5-star album!<br /><br />Note: If you are buying new ones from any sellers who are not fulfilled by amazon, always ask condition of digipak. When my digipak arrived, it had a 'hole' punched at the spine and many wrinkled lines.<br /><br />Get this and enjoy mexico's finest!
B00A3AU9KI|3.0|Works Great. Is reliable with solid construction. Has good reach. But...the cord has no coil and gets tangled. Worse, the lightning plug is too wide and doesn't fit the opening on my gel case or my hard case. It does fit my slim case, but only because that one doesn't cover the bottom. I'm not unhappy with it, but be aware of the drawbacks before making a purchase.
B003U6BE8I|2.0|Movie is one I liked the special effects a lot and the acting is OK but the DVD after the third watch locked up my DVD player and I had to turn off the power then it back on to get My DVD player to spit it out. Now it wont even see the DVD. I tried another DVD player and saw the DVD but ti locks up half way through the DVD.
B00GH4R95C|5.0|The fight scenes in the movie were a lot better than the first one. And this could be the one that replaces the original Superman movies.
B00742GBDM|2.0|Sorry but they cut the book up so much that if I had not read Mansfield Park I would never have believed the story came from that book. I lost interest and cant remember where I lost interest at. If I lost the DVD I would never miss it.
B00AEFY3MC|5.0|Galaxy Quest is one of my favorite movies.  I never get tired or bored watching it!!!! It is a cult classic!!!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It's really neat to be able to watch my favorite netflix shows on my wide screen TV. My only disappointment is that it isn't compatible with amazon home video.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Its a cute little device. Sometimes the audio and video looses sync but for the most part it works well. Wish there was an Amazon prime video app for android phones but you cant have everything. For $35 its a fun device to mess around with but its not a replacement for real IPTV. I would go with a Roku.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|You cannot cast anything from a Chrome Browser if your using any phone/tablet OS, this feature (the only one I cared about) only works on a pc running full version of Chrome with extensions..
B00EP0KBXM|4.0|Good family movie with older kids.  Somewhat inspiring.  Showing determination to battle through and overcome personal fears.  Will watch again.
006212725X|5.0|This is an honest recounting of a very prolific life. I found it to be very interesting and hard to put down.
B00BMVTS1S|4.0|Great adventure story to watch with teenage kids.  The wife even liked it!  Lots of CGI but that is what this series of movies is known for.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|It was so great that I had to buy a second one.  I would give it 5 stars but the diamond rod doesn't lock which is why I would actually recommend the &#34;Lansky Sharpeners Tactical BladeMedic Knife Sharpener&#34;.  It is everything this sharpener is and more, plus the rod locks.  Although I now bought the Lansky, I would by no means get rid of the Smith. Since they are both the same price, you can't go wrong!
6304981635|4.0|a classic superhero fighting machine.  the best all time bruce lee movie ever.  great fight scenes and excellent story line.
B000002GXX|5.0|The last album with the original Eagles -Bernie Leadon ,  I am huge eagles fan since the beginning I have every record, On this album the over looked Gems  are &#34;Hollywood Waltz &#34; about people doing same love dance over and over without ever stopping to see what they have with the person they're with, and the other brilliant song the closer-a farewell lullaby about comfort after  letting go of a lost love ( co-written by strangely Patti Davis: Ronald Reagan's daughter  , believe it or not) --&#34;I wish you peace&#34; this song gives me such solace thru all these years.&#34; One the these Nights&#34;  is th last album before &#34;Hotel California&#34;made them super super stars and ruined their ability to write another decent song, of course Don Henly rose from the ashes as the true brilliant star that made the eagles fly to begin with.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Amazing story for everyone.  A unique way of storytelling at its best.  Great characters and history mixed with an excellent story.
B00005ABKC|5.0|Tom Petty's song writing hits it's peak on this album besides the hits ,he sings of his break up with such heart and anger &#34;woman in love &#34; is one of my all time favorite songs. And the sadder regretful &#34;Insider&#34; with Stevie Nicks singing  &#34;I've had to live with some hard promise , I've crawled Through the briars, I'm an insider&#34;.  It doesn't get any better than that . Brilliant song writing
B00G70WLJA|5.0|was good story and lot funny part of the movie, story keep from same story from the past so it was good
0694003611|5.0|Book well made--easy for little one's to hold; beautiful illustrations; my children begged for this story every night when they were small; now my grandson can enjoy too!
B00785P2QC|4.0|Good game. Able to add on to the start of the game. Tit<br /> Is nice that the game keeps functioning while your not present.
B000IZ7YK6|5.0|One of the finest scripts ever penned, attached to a wonderful score by Jerry Goldsmith and top-notch acting. What's not to love?
B000AJIF4E|5.0|The feeling of ecstasy I get while wearing these things is incredibly soothing. When listening to anything with these I feel as if I'm floating on cloud nine. I can hear EVERYTHING with these. They do require a little bit of breaking in to start feeling good on your head though. I also recommend buying the  Beyerdynamic EDT 250 Velour Padded Earcushions to put on these instead of the stock cushions. They greatly improve the listening experience.

B007T99ENE|5.0|This is a very cleaver book and is easy to read. It led me buy the autobiography of a MI5 director.
0143038583|5.0|I found Pollan's argument throughout this book to be simply amazing. He brings up great points and made me see things differently about my food. If you're scared of coming out as a vegetarian after reading this book, don't be, because Pollan himself comes out as an Omnivore, same as before. But you will see your food and the food business in a different way.<br />From an AP lang point of view, this is a great book to study about what a good argument essay looks like.<br />I recommend you buy it from Amazon, I originally bought it from a different book company and never got my book.
0451529065|5.0|Amazingly insightful - fun watching him figure out all he did without the concept of genetics existing. Right time after time. He answers so many of the still attempted refutations of Evolution, it is actually funny to see the detractors still bringing up the same issues. Cudos to Richard Dawkins, et al, for their work defending evolution, but Darwin wields a huge club against most of the current arguments and does so in a thorough and thought provoking way. Since this is one of the most important science books ever written, anyone interested in the subject should require themselves to read it.
B00BUVPIRS|2.0|I downloaded it and It got to the first cutscene  and then it crashed.... please fix it.... unwilling rate higher once it's fixed
1451683405|3.0|Not his best work. While I agree with the ideas, many of his arguments are tautalogical or poorly developed. He often states his 'theory', then instead of building a case for it, simply assumes it to be true and wanders off in some other direction.  It is short in length, shallow in insight and weak in development.  Better to read some of his other, better works.
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|Great game.I love the excitement it gives me.I downloaded the for my 14 year old son but i think i play it more than him.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|Enjoyed this game at the start but very soon you have to spend more and more to advance even slightly in building the town.  That ruined it for me and I don't recall seeing that explained up front.
3836522845|5.0|Book for my daughter's Xmas.  Can't figure just why she wanted this book.  Have not looked at it.  Don't intend to.  She will have to rate this one.  I'm not even  going to try.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Love the movie... am horrified by the Spanish voice for Gru. What on earth were they thinking?! Oh, and in case you are thinking of listening to the dubbed Spanish while reading the Spanish subtitles, do not get this item bcs the two are not in sync. They say basically the same thing, but in different ways, using different words - talk about mind-bending!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is wonderful game it's lovely and it teaches you a lot about horses it's great and fun for the kids. I love playing this game.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Well, I shouldn't tell you this, but this program works great.  But if I rave it's going away.  Tubemate easily downloads from youtube - either as an MP3 or a video.  Think about that for awhile.
B00BAXFJ5M|2.0|When the sixth book in an established series is entitled simply by the names of the series characters, you have to say to yourself, there must be a movie deal in here somewhere. Well, you would be wrong, it is a television deal replete with a pitch from the author to watch the show, also titled King and Maxwell.<br /><br />That's my biggest beef. But there are others.<br /><br />The book itself attempts to channel the Iran Contra affair in the 1980s. Two former Secret Service agents Sean King and Michelle Maxwell get involved when trying to rescue a visibly upset teenager running in rainy and dark Washington streets with a German pistol. From there it  gets really crazy to the point that the President, who has an entire government at his disposal turns to Sean King and Michelle Maxwell to make the world safe from cyber-terrorists.<br /><br />Enough said. The problem is that Baldacci is too good a writer for this over the top commercialism. It can be fun, but I would wait for a sequel which isn't designed to jump start the Nielsens.
0765350386|3.0|I finally gave up on this one a little over half way through.  It just wasn't very well written. I prefer Raymond Feist or Patrick Rothfuss.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|way too addictive but runs a little choppy on my kindle hd but its a welcome addition to the app store
B0063GORYU|5.0|Brilliant free game. Can be made easier by changing some settings to help get use to the game. Mind challenging and fun.
B0012TWRAO|5.0|What's there to write. Works as advertised. The RAM mount system is great and very convenient, for temporary mounting or permanent fixtures.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This game is Amazingly fun. If been waiting for this game to come to kindle for a long time now
B0031R5K72|5.0|The tears are still in my eyes.... crying for all those souls, that lost their lives.<br />It's been a very long time, since I've been moved at the core of my soul, by a book. But this one did!<br />Thank you Markus Zusak.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Really fun I have a blast while playing it. Most of my family has it on there iPhone so I'm excited it's on the kindle fire. Lots of the levels can be challenging but it doesn't stress me out so that's good.
B00ANY7V8M|5.0|I took this to work.  Yes, I'm a little outside the age demographic for this toy, but seriously, the friends line of Legos is the coolest thing!  It fits on my filing cabinet and doesn't clutter up my space.
B00BEXB18M|5.0|Don't listen to this album once or even twice. It needs a few times for the riffs and guitar work to sink in. Not their best, but way better than 13. Best tracks dancing in the rain and burn. They'll get stuck in your head after awhile & stay there for a very long time. Good comeback.
B009NF54ZE|3.0|Too much dialogue, not enough challenges. Can skip the talking but wouldn't know the story. Not real difficult. Glad I got it for free.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|Loved, loved, LOVED the performance, especially Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess!!  I can't get enough of it! Karimloo plays such a powerful Phantom, and Boggess blossoms from timid little wallflower to passion flower under his guidance. Her conflicting feelings for the Phantom really come through, especially at the end when she looks back at him longingly, as if not sure whether to stay or to go. Karimloo seems to see the question in her eyes and nods to as if to say that it's okay, she may go, don't worry about him. It brings me to tears EVERY time. Definitely better than the 2004 movie. If you can't get to the theatre to see the stage version, GET THIS!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game is AMAZING I love it!!!!!😃 I recommend this game to anyone who loves to create and anyone who likes awesome games!!!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|It's a very good app and I like the mpoints might take a while to get to a reward but if I'm not doing anything it passes the time.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Love the book love the movie!!! Its so honest and hilarious!!! I wish there were more Minnie's in this world!! Saying its a shame that women with hearts like those had to live in fear and ridicule like that is not even coming close to the word to describe it. My daughter and I always use the line &#34;You is kind, You is smart, You is important&#34; with each other. Love that!!!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Love it!  Very addicting. Don't like when you get booted out in the tournaments. You lose the free game you were playing.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Get it! SERIOUSLY THIS GAME IS TOTALLY WORTH IT. I can't get enough of building games and this tips them!
B00GGEV828|5.0|...because it is so fantastic that I have literally watched it 23 times and it has yet to get old....that's why.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The series is fantastic.  Watching via amazon prime was so much easier than watching via Comcast on demand.  I wish I watched the first two seasons via prime.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|One of the best movies of all time! You can't go wrong watching this anytime of the year! Love it
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This is so much better than the original game on Facebook.  Better graphics, fun play and great animation.  Would highly recommend to anyone who loves quest based games.  Easy to follow as well.  Does have in game &quot;real money&quot; purchasing, but really don't need it.  Have a great time playing.  Now Zagnya<br />needs to do the same with the zoo game and Dream towers.
B002HNA95E|5.0|Revolver and Celebration are two great songs that didn't get any radio airplay but they should have!! I would recommend the Immaculate collection as well...
B003G4W49C|5.0|Enders game was more then awesome.  This book has every detail that it needed it had no more then it needed and no less.<br />I loved it!
B000KGGLCU|5.0|This is Madonna's best work of all time.  It is also my top album of all time and the best concert I have seen live in person.  There is not enough special effects or hot dancers to top Madonna's Confessions Tour.
B00E8G5H6Y|5.0|new product,with promp delivery, reasonably priced this is why we purchased this video for our star wars collection. Thank you
B008XNZMOU|1.0|I don't get it.  The most overrated artist we have seen in years.  Radio will play her music but she knows nothing about love and you can feel it when she sings.  Why would anyone pay for this anyway when you can hear it free on the radio 247.  The music is bland and cheesy.
B002M9WW30|5.0|Bought it for 20 bucks. What can I say? It's Rocky full collection! Of course it's awesome.<br />Audio may not work for some if they don't have surround sound connected to bluray. So would have to switch from Stereo to Mono.<br />Either way greatest movie.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I hysterically enjoyed this game. This one wasn't overwrought with hidden object scenes every two seconds. I like them but this game gave some nicely balanced variety .
1250038820|4.0|I loved the collection of photos in this book, however, I was looking for more story - similar to what the site is now - as opposed to the snippets and single sentences that were found in this book.<br /><br />Perhaps the next installment will feature those types of stories. I don't know if I'll get another book if it's in this format again, especially since I doubt I'd be missing much.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|GREAT game love it. Only con is no one is playing it BUY IT NOW and play with me please
B00E3BK0QQ|4.0|I love the graphics & the game is enjoyable & interactive. No hidden object which is a refreshing change. I like the time loops it really adds to the story. I think it's fairly priced for the quality.
B00D2ZF3GQ|5.0|This is a wonderful movie.  My husband and I watched it on an airline trip and purchased it when it came out on Blu-ray/DVD.
B0007M22TI|2.0|I do love the celtic woman, but this one was not as good as other ones. Just a waste of money once again.
B000N2HCKQ|5.0|I enjoyed the simple actionable ideas presented. I have already begun to alter my style of communicating ideas for change.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It kept me interested even though it was far fetched. I like most of Grishams books but not as well as his first ones.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I really like the first two books.  Even though they all take at least 150 pages to get interesting, the first two at least held my interest well.  This book is just a complete turn for the worst though.  I feel that what fuel or direction the author had, slowly drifted away.  It's slow and boring.  The end is horrible and garbage.  What happened?  I just feel this series lost its stride and someone took the reins and said &#34;let's see how badly we can end this.&#34;  It doesn't even fit really.  I don't know, it's just not what I had hoped for.  I guess two out of three is better then not enjoying the series at all right? By the way, this took me several attempts to finish reading.  Probably over 6 months because my attention was always pulled away.  Read it to finish the series but don't get your hopes up.
0670026603|2.0|This story is proof that tragic circumstances do not make a book deep. It was pretty predictable and cliché. The characters were mostly flat and one-dimensional. The paradox of Will's resolution to show Louisa how to live her life right is extremely ironic. The writing style was very simple and underwhelming, too.<br />Moral of the story: It's okay for someone to commit suicide as long as they leave you their money, expose you to some culture and make sure you go to college.<br />I've read young adult books that were deeper than this, with a better message, too.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is very addictive, and a fun way to pass the time. Social competition makes it better than most games where you are just playing against a machine.
1250012570|5.0|I loved Eleanor and Park.  I found myself rereading certain passages just to figure out how Rowell does the impossible-- juxtapose the vicious cruelty of real high school kids with the pure poetry of new (and profound) love.  Their lows are so low, and so real--I loved the honesty of the conflicts--internal as well as external.  And the highs are so high--makes you remember that terrifying free fall into the soaring abyss of adolescence.  But this is real adolescence-- not the experience your parents think you had.  This book makes you cringe to remember the awfulness of high school even as it makes you envy the intensity of those days-- fragile and fraught and filled with bad words, bad thoughts, unendurable moments.  And sublime beauty.  Like The Fault in Our Stars, this book shows you how much YA lit can be.
B00DT99BX6|4.0|I found this to be a really sweet story - enjoying it more than I expected.<br /><br />The beginning with the silly, spoiled little rich girl (Camille) almost put me off, but I persevered and I'm pleased I did.<br /><br />The story drags a little with the counselling conversations, yet jumps around quickly in others so that I couldn't understand how one scene had morphed into another. Still, by halfway through I was hooked and I definitely enjoyed the second half of the book more than the first.<br /><br />Armand definitely deserved a happy ending, but as I don't do spoilers, you'll have to read the book to find out whether he got it.
B00447G29S|5.0|Polar Express is a Wonderful Christmas Movie for the entire family and even better in 3D Blu-Ray.  Can't wait till our grandchildren can enjoy it with us.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|This was a honest and straight forward book..it was perfect in its own way of explaining the complexities of being locked up .
0307951529|5.0|Loved the book. Author does a great job of turning a possibly boring subject into entertaining and motivating! With the mixture of real life examples/stories of thousands of cases Chris turns the daunting world of Entrepreneurship into something that any seems achievable by any simpleton. If you have the itch to going full entrepreneur or you've contemplated making some money on the side definitely pick this book up.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Beautiful and moving beyond belief... A story I will not soon forget nor would I want to! Saddened terribly that it had to end!
B007REV4YI|3.0|Decent movie<br />But many plot holes, and for an action/bond movie thats still saying something.<br /><br />I had heard it was AMAZING, but Casino Royale is still a MUCH better movie.<br /><br />I was very disappointed.  Its still Bond, but...meh..
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Very useful for casting YouTube and Netflix to the TV.  Would be great if more platforms were available.  Works best from my iPhone.  Clear HD picture.  You can't beat the price.
B000I9YWDO|5.0|One of the greatest movies of all time--if you work in a tech company.  While it was not a hit in theaters, it certainly is a cult classic. I can never look at a swingline stapler the same way.
B00BC254I8|5.0|I've read many autobiographies before but none as brutally honest as this. I suspected this to be the case because Tyson's habit of blurting out whatever was on his mind while in the public spotlight. There is no sugar coating here and the man tells it like it is. Thanks Mike! I know the final chapter isn't written yet but let's give it a happy ending.
B00B2166BS|2.0|the pogo cable did not seem to charge my nexus 10 much faster than the usb connector, and with most cases its not always easy to get it to stay on. and the speed increase was NOT that impressive.<br /><br />It was not a huge investment price wise, but it hardly improved the function of the tablet.  And again, while the magnet action is cool, it would seem to disconnect and not charge too often.  When you are letting it charge overnight and realize it fell off, its a big problem.

0321885112|4.0|Its an interesting book. I got the version with video and additional online content.  While I think its very interesting, I feel the major issue is--I am not that good of an artist--I have tried but my notes probably will never look as good as the examples in this book--but like more skills--practice is essential.<br /><br />Do listen to the videos and the online content--and read the book--but don't forget to practice drawing your tiny little clocks!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|My daughter and I read this together and loved it! Can't wait to read the entire Oz collection of books
B00GH4R95C|4.0|It was good, I couldn't give it 5 stares because it covered birth to super hero without enough time to develop the story.
B00847UYWA|4.0|This is must read material for backround on Lovecraft or Stephen King.  The King in Yellow also heartens to a time without snappy scene changes, where the story is drawn out in a languid expository manner you don't find in modern horror fiction.  We see the storyline coming a mile away, but I like to indulge in the texture and color of the descriptive prose.
B005LN5UOC|4.0|Good third party solution, cheaper than Sony. Fits for right ear, does not bend , mold etc for left ear. Sounds clear, charges in around 3 hours, has its own cable to charge. Good enough for price.
B000IYU9IG|5.0|I enjoyed this movie when it was released in theaters. It showed that John Wayne could actually be funny and also showed that he  was sensitive to how Indians were being treated by the government by being forced to go to reservations.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|This movie reminds us all that if you let the cat out of the bag the bag will be empty. It has the pitch of the Beatles song Hay Jude but can carry it's own weight in the Stanley Cup championship of the NFL Baseball league. So watch it with a open mind and a closed microwave door. The ending seems to come right at the exact time that the movie is over but that's all right because of the fast start of this movie event. Refreshing-YES!!!!  Makes your nose run-NO!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game, very dificult to put down.  Love the different levels and connection with friends.  Challenging and easy at the same time.
B0036S4C6G|3.0|If you can accept that you will just not be able to capture or keep straight all the circulating stories and have faith they connect but maybe do not all conclude then it is enjoyable. The metaphor of age as a goon is witty and intellectually appealing. Like a private joke you feel a part of the sub culture that 'gets it'.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|Totally awesome! Loved it! Weeerrrrrrreeeeee I'm so happy sunshine lollipops and rainbows everything it's hard to see a different me!
0743270754|5.0|It took a little while to get into, but by the end I felt I really knew Abraham Lincoln and loved him for his intelligence, patience, kindness and humanity.
0307744434|4.0|This story was very different from anything I expected. I enjoyed Water for Elephants so I was looking for another &#34;circus&#34; book. While it is nothing like Water for Elephants its definitely an entertaining read. You get so caught up in the story you start wishing you could actually attend this circus.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|The story is compelling, the characters memorable, the writing is beautiful- I could not put the book down. Highly recommended!
B008220C38|2.0|I didn't even finish watching the movie. I found it really dull. I'm not sure what else there is to say. I don't even think I made it halfway through the movie because it couldn't hold my attention.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love the graphics and soon there will be a update I love the creeper the zombies and . the skeletons
0316228583|2.0|I never could get into the book. It switches back and forth between so many different characters and nothing really exciting happens. None of the characters were very likable so I had a hard time caring what happened to them. Eventually I gave up finishing the book. I  expected better from J. K. Rowling.
B004UID2LC|5.0|It is user friendly and fast :) I loved it ever since I downloaded it. So glad that I found it
0385535139|3.0|I just couldn't get into this book. I usually love John Grisham's books. These characters just weren't very likable to me. I didn't even bother to finish the book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a great game for both children and adults.  It's a good way to past the time during the morning commute if you take the train or bus into the office.  The graphics are great and the company is always updating the scenes/scenarios to keep the user interested.  There are many different ways to win prizes or use the point’s earner to change your avatar.  You can also buy out difficult missions so that you’re not stuck on one task for too long.  I like the larger screen (Kindle) for the kids.
B0042RUMIW|5.0|Is a lll what i spect from sting a master piece and also the dvd is amazing i strongly recommend this cd
0316055433|2.0|Long, rambling unnecessary tale..One page was worth the read...Toward the end where art is spoken about..otherwise  ugh..Sorry..I looked forward to reading this with great anticipation, but was sooo disappointed. Joan Davisson, Santa Cruz
B003TML0VO|5.0|a special selection of the music that Santana likes, excellent work , excellent songs and interpretations, i recommend so far
B00AQN09VQ|5.0|I seldom watch TV shows but saw this one awhile back and absolutely rolled in the floor laughing. Next to the Showtime Homelad series this show is #1A.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|A good representation of a person with serious drug and alcohol problems and the consequent serious messes it creates in his life. However, the story --- the plot --- has twists and turns that I found hard to believe. John Goodman steals the show as the &#34;friendly&#34; drug dealer. Denzel Washington's portrayal was not always convincing. Despite the drawbacks, the film is compelling to watch.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|I loved reading this book, it's got some for everybody. Thrill, laughter, history etc., lots of fun to read this book...
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|Marvel's &#34;Iron Man 3&#34; pits brash-but-brilliant industrialist Tony Stark/Iron Man against an enemy whose reach knows no bounds. When Stark finds his personal world destroyed at his enemy's hands, he embarks on a harrowing quest to find those responsible. This journey, at every turn, will test his mettle. With his back against the wall, Stark is left to survive by his own devices, relying on his ingenuity and instincts to protect those closest to him. As he fights his way back, Stark discovers the answer to the question that has secretly haunted him: does the man make the suit or does the suit make the man?
B002YK8OKC|5.0|This has been a classic in my family since I was a kid. It's still as funny and relatable today as it was when released.
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|This is a very good 2nd part to the original Monsters Inc.  Well done.<br /><br />Mike Wazowski and James P. Sullivan are an inseparable pair, but that wasn't always the case. From the moment these two mismatched monsters met they couldn't stand each other. &#34;Monsters University&#34; unlocks the door to how Mike and Sulley overcame their differences and became the best of friends.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Comfortable on my wrist and keeps good time. Very easy to adjust is my favorite thing. I applaud Seiko for the great dial design.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|We always thought an alien invasion would come from outer space and beyond...it did not...it came from under our oceans.<br /><br />When monstrous creatures, known as Kaiju, started rising from the sea, a war began that would take millions of lives and consume humanity's resources for years on end. To combat the giant Kaiju, a special type of weapon was devised: massive robots, called Jaegers, which are controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are locked in a neural bridge. But even the Jaegers are proving nearly defenseless in the face of the relentless Kaiju. On the verge of defeat, the forces defending mankind have no choice but to turn to two unlikely heroes - a washed up former pilot (Charlie Hunnam) and an untested trainee (Rinko Kikuchi) - who are teamed to drive a legendary but seemingly obsolete Jaeger from the past. Together, they stand as mankind's last hope against the mounting apocalypse.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Love Hill Climb! New content keeps me playing. I love the addition of record keeping for each vehicle. Played it on Apple and now I'm back with android!
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|I have had this game for a long time and its still addicting honestley in my opinion its way better than minecraft not that i dont like minecraft but you should really get this game!!!!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I don't always love Stephen King. I'll even admit that some of his stuff just isn't for me (The Dark Tower series), but this one knocked it out of the park! The Shining remains one of the scariest movies to me (and one of my favorite King books), so to revisit that place from my childhood was so cool!
B003B02O0U|4.0|I really enjoy Gresham's books. This is one of his classics and it is an excellent read. The story isn't as compelling as The Firm, but it is definitely worth your time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Perfect<br />A+ game I am 5 years old and I love it<br />I love this game<br />It is the coolest
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Better than the first camera I thought it was going to be the same but this on  came with themes and everything. I'm telling you, you need to download this app.!!!
B00G21XNKU|5.0|A classic Dr Who adventure.  Great to see David Tennent and Tom Baker.  And the upcoming search for Gallifray should be great fodder for more adventures
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a cute addictive game for all ages.  Clean fun and funny characters.  Keeps you busy for hours on end!
B007VWEEQQ|3.0|Product quality looks fine, my mistake on not doing more research about what I needed, I ended up not using it.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Absolutely awesome game....love it! My kids love it and I've got a bunch of friends hooked on the game.....I can't put it down!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I've never cried so much while reading a book. Green really knows how to tug at your heart while making you also reevaluate yourself and the world around you. Absolutely beautiful.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Having read the trilogy, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie version.  I must say that the visual was much more than my poor imagination had realized and was excellent.
B001EBWITA|5.0|the movie was awesome keanu reeves was great his character all bitter dark and tornented was one of his best
B0083GQ2A0|5.0|Wonderful movie. Explores manhood, courage, myth and the meaning of savagery. Neeson is amazing in a difficult part. To be a brooding, distant and burned out man, but also a leader and show sympathy and courage to the dying. To speak the truth when a lie will be &#34;easier&#34; and to attempt impossible odds even know you will fail, because you are a Man. Beta males and other worker units will find this movie uninspiring.<br /><br />Bought the movie because I intend to watch it every year to help me go forward.<br /><br />&#34;Once more into the fray<br />Into the last good fight I'll ever know<br />Live and die on this day<br />Live and die on this day &#34;
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game.  I play it every chance I get.  It makes me use my brain and its one that you can put it down and come back to.
B006LXQID8|4.0|An insteresting story, funny and romantic, but all rather mild. Entertaining overall. I was expecting Amelie to be more &#34;magical&#34;, but again, she was only mildly so. The story is totally &#34;G&#34; rated, but there are unfortunately some unrelated nudility mixed in.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Omgossh ; I Showed This Movie To My Twin Brothers & They Just Loved It. I Went To So Many Websites Looking For It & I Finally Found It ; They Ask To Watch It Everyday.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Anyone who has seen Downton Abbey loves it. I actually bought this for my daughter as a gift. And yes, she did love it. The script is great, the actors wonderful, everything is (or at least seems to be) authentic for the place and period.
0316017930|5.0|It wasn't that great of a book to read, but it was required for me to read. However the book came on time, and it was in good condition. It smelled a little weird, but almost every paperback book does.
B00BC254I8|4.0|I really enjoyed this read. I get a kick out of the many contradictions of not only Tyson as a character but also as a storyteller. There are many things I find hard to believe, but as with most auto bios you have t remember the author is telling a one sided story. There is a lot of honesty here. But I think also a lot of self agrandizing which fits perfectly with the author we get to know. Lots of fun
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Just what I expected just like to have a spare cable incase one dies. Good value and know it will be just what I need,
B0081ISUOG|5.0|Stopwatch and Timer Pro by L.droid is a great stopwatch and timer program.  I am using this app on my Kindle Fire HD and have had no programs with the app freezing or crashing.  The app appears to be very stable.  I use this for when I workout to keep track of my workout times.  This version is the ad-free version so you will not be annoyed by well annoying ads popping up.  The app has a bunch of features like being able adjust display size, color, and even font size.  I enjoy using this app and would recommend it.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review.
B00DKY4LBW|2.0|I liked this album on the first play.  However, on the 2nd listen, I realized, &#34;oh, no, this sounds like a Justin Timberlake record!&#34; Songs like &#34;Arabella&#34; and &#34;I Want It All&#34;, with their vocals in sung in unison in 2 octaves, and the herky-jerky melodies, sound like a slower cousins of bad R&B, pop, and blue-eyed soul.  The attempts to slide into notes sing everything flat sounds like Britney Spears or American Idol.  &#34;Why'd You Only Call Me When You're High&#34; would fit in the same playlist as &#34;I'm bringing Sexy Back&#34; or whatever it's called.  I applaud their attempt to try something different, but, if they want to try a funkier sound, listen to Marvin Gaye or Arthur Alexander.
0061714372|4.0|I have been a fan of Megadeth since album one, though not a die hard fan, but an on and off general fan. I have paid much more attention to their music for the past ten years, and become a bigger fan in that time, mainly after hearing Mustaine had become a Christian.<br /><br />I knew bits and pieces of the early days with Metallica, and other info, but I wanted to read the book to find out what his story was more completely, especially his religious conversion. Well, with this book you get that and much, much more.<br /><br />We find a man who led a really rough life as a teen, then became a rock star, and followed the typical path of over-indulging in sex, drugs, drugs, drugs, drugs, more drugs, and rock and roll - and lots of alcohol. How anyone can survive this lifestyle is amazing, but he pulled through.<br /><br />After finishing, I felt like I knew Dave a lot better, and just wish I could move out to be a close friend, as well as join the band. With bassist David Ellefson also converting to Christianity, adding me on drums would make 3/4 of the band Christian...lol. Anyway, I enjoyed the book and the story, and cranking some Megadeth along the way.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works as advertised, I hope they keep adding more functinality but with a Chrome browser on your PC and extensions you're almost limitless.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|Just bout perfect! Yes the story was the same but being able 2 actually see their faces with great camera work was icing on the cake! Plus can't say enough about the finale!  Loved it!
B007R0Y7VO|5.0|An absolutely heart-warming and inspiring story that kept us rivetted from the opening scene to the last. The cinematography is spectacular and the story wonderful. A must watch.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|I  might like it more if there were instructions.  it is a lot of trial and error.  i lost interest in it quickly,
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|don't understand ins and outs yet. definitely working on it. thanks for the free game. enjoying it so far. easy to follow instructions.
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|The star actors are appealing and do not have your everyday, ordinary personalities.  The issues of mental health are dealt with as serious , but in a refreshing, frank way, and the film remains light hearted and up beat.  This was my second time watching the movie and I enjoyed it as much as the first time.
B00FAIPDAE|5.0|It's a fun game very nice pace a high ceiling for defense build up capabilities. Very large areas to build, good graphics and animation,
B000HKW7E0|5.0|My husband and I watch this every year before Christmas.  It makes us realize our family may not be so dysfunctional after all.  And no matter how many times we watch it, we always have a good laugh.  One of the funniest movies I've ever seen.
B00F91H15W|2.0|Ok movie, but not a must see. I'd rent on a 98 cent special. Move to another movie. The best part of the movie was Emma Watson.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|The game won't update on my Amazon Kindle.  Can't get new stages! otherwise great game for all ages and very addicting!
1401938906|5.0|After reading this myself I got it for my son in order to be a bit more positive and realize what IS possible with some well directed thoughts.  A good book for ANYONE to read.  Well written with some touches of humor thrown in, it gives you an entirely new perspective on life , God and where we fit into things.
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|So far it has been pretty good... exciting, new events happening, but kind of prolonging too much for something to happen!  It's getting me impatient! ;)
B000RLHDUM|5.0|A great remake of the original, in fact I like this one better.  There are some steamy scenes so I wouldn't recommend kids watch it, but Pierce Brosnan is great!
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|Good movie but with a predictable plot. As a pilot, I also noticed some inaccuracies about flying. All in all, a good movie but not outstanding.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|It is a family tradition to watch this movie each year. It is hard to say no at this price for the blu-ray!
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I despised the first two or three pages. Jumped right in with too much detail, and the people were confusing. I couldn't understand who was who. Once the story settled, it was a lot of fun. I love dramatic college love stories, and this was fun. I can admit it was kind of predictable, but for a nice winter read I really enjoyed it as a nineteen year old college girl.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Denzel does a great job as a flawed hero who possibly has more issues than he does redemptive qualities. and jon goodman is a perfect hippie
B0065GC0BA|3.0|I am a big romantic so this book was really hard for me to read...<br /><br />The characters were amazing but it was heartbreaking to see Will slip away through the pages and realizing the happy ever after I was looking for may never happen, I kind of suspected what the ending was going to be, but I kept hoping to be wrong...<br /><br />Overall it is a good book, it will certainly give you a new perspective on life...
B0091WNK8M|5.0|Awesome movie, still entertaining after all of these years.  It is also a great movie to show younger kids these days too.
B005PK1G76|5.0|Very useful addition for stroller (we have a City Mini GT).  Same as a more expensive item (but obviously cheaper).  I did notice that it had a strong odor when we first got it, but it was fine after airing out for a few weeks (we bought this about a month before our daughter was born, so we weren't in a rush).
B007TNS6JI|5.0|this game is REALLY REALLY  good , ive been looking for a good rpg game for a while and i came across this one , I already had some gameloft games and i really like them so i tested this one out, it has really good grapphics, nice controls , it runs smooth , although sometimes it lags , i really like how you can choose your own class , it somewhat reminds me of world of warcraft , I recomend this game to anyone looking for a good rpg
1608871827|5.0|Wow this is a MONSTER book, filled with lots of drawings, background information, and tidbits on the various characters.  The small &#34;greeblies&#34; like Mako's ID badge are pretty neat to see.  Love the detailed schematic photos of the jaegers.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|A real page-turner!  A very well written book which holds your interest every step of the way.  However, the message is very frightening -- especially given current (2013) news reports concerning security leaks, the things we readily accept in the way of invasion of personal information through social media, more and more security cameras.  What seems innocent,  benign, and helpful can quickly become the tools of evil.  It's very like Orwell's '1984', only updated and more pervasive.  Everyone should read this to become aware of how we allow our brains to gradually accept corruption of our lives and how we must prevent it.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|I really love this movie, but then again, I was raised in the transformers / Godzilla culture of the late 70's / 80's, so go figure. The amount of attention to detail is really stunning, and I really like that Del Toro tried to do as much of the filming NON-CGI as possible.  It does translate better into the big screen and just looks less &#34;fake&#34;.  The acting is decent, although I feel the person that really steals the show and adds a lot of emotional &#34;oomph&#34; to the story is the actress who plays young Mako.  She's got that scared and wide eyed stare of wonder thing down pat.  The one thing I noticed (while in the theater watching the film) was that I wish the composer would vary some of the thematic music (especially every time you see a jaeger pop onto the screen).<br /><br />The blu-ray extras are a nice look into the making of the film.  This film apparently did better overseas than here in the states, and there has already been some talk about a sequel...
B0058Z4NR8|5.0|Great History book on western civilization.  The author covers history back to the ice ages.  His points are exhaustively researched.  And very well written.
0785153942|4.0|Helps to fill in some of the gaps in the storyline, for not only Raleigh, but also for Tendo Choi and Marshall Pentecost.  Fairly quick read though.
B005VPRETE|5.0|As mentioned this was a gift for my niece when she was on the LEGO kick. She loved it. It was such a cute set when all built. Not too advanced, but not MegaBlock status. :)
B008AT9XOC|4.0|The behind-the-scenes stuff and (original but abandoned) ending were welcome additions to the BetaMax copy I have been viewing for over a quarter century. Besides learning of the serendipitous discovery by director, Frank Oz, of how to make the plant &#34;talk&#34; by speeding up the footage taken of muppeteering, the original darker ending (from the stage play and original Roger Corman versions) help remind people of the Faustian side of this tale.
B0000C3I6U|5.0|Love this movie! Good to get you motivated and pumped up before the gym! Classic Arnold movie, in his prime!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I was involved in so many lives and the culture of another country. It got my attention right away and I didn't want to put it down. But I had to , so I could hardly wait to get back to it. I want to read more by the author!
B00005YW4H|5.0|EXCELLENT CD! GREAT VOICE AND CHOICE OF SONGS. Most of the songs on this CD are very good. Would like to see her in person someday.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|As with every novel by him, it was very enjoyable and you just want to keep reading, now I can start with Inferno...<br /><br />Finally!
B00723NWJE|4.0|I like Norah Jones, but never listen to this CD. I bought it as a gift. She has a great voice and enjoy her writing. I really like the CD<br />I have of her.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|the game is ok not the best though I have played better so yeah I would want them to keep making games but not like this one cause I do not get it
B007YLEN42|4.0|Dido has a unique voice and her songs are very good. I enjoy this Cd and would tell others to buy it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun game and even great for kids :) my 5 yr old nephew loves it too. Hard to find a game that is fun for everyone.
B00FMJJ064|5.0|Lindsey has beautifully combined dubstep beats and rhythms with her amazing skill as a violinist into an intoxicating marriage that is simply sublime in its achievement of auditory bliss.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I cant get enough of this game it is so cool go download it now for something to play all day while you can
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This app makes it easy for you to  switch devices any time I need to.<br />Easy to use<br />A must have if you own different devices.
B003ZSH606|5.0|I like it as all the other Jamiroquai's CD. I can not say anything else. I recommend it for everyone who likes Jamiroquai.
1417734035|5.0|I used this book a great deal when I was in elementary school in the early 1980's and have remembered it for 35 years. My son loves to draw and I hope that he will find the same joy in these pages that I did when I was his age. To the reviewers who say the book is unimaginative, I say that the book teaches an artist how to create images of real objects from simple lines and shapes. If you can learn that concept, you can draw anything on your own without unimaginative copying. If you don't go in that direction, there is still one other thing to love about this book: It's just fun!
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I was going to buy Rosetta stone but my kids Spanish teacher told me to try this site and I am very glad I did.  I can use it on my computer or my kindle and it is amazing!  I find myself learning with minimal effort.  I feel challenged and find myself getting very involved.  Fun and educational can't beat that!  I stink at spelling so that is a bit challenging but the app adapts which is awesome!!  Gracias duolingo!
B0035HKWLW|4.0|Very funny with very good specials effects. My grandkids were kind of scared. So I don't recommend for kids under 8 years old.
1400034205|5.0|A fabulous read and even greater film from 1940's. A man's search for self and integrity and love. Just beautifully written as only Maugham can do.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Good way to hunt without getting out and freezing your butt off. Energy level could be quicker and it would be nice to be able to sell off some old weapons to buy new ones.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|It really does all it says it will do!  I typed a note and it went to my Kindle Fire HD!  Good to have a product that does what it advertises itself to do.  Thank you.
0762445262|3.0|This is kind of cute for my Batman obsessed toddler but it is so small that I wouldn't bother with the purchase.  The emblem shines on the wall nicely but is no more than 1 1/2 inches.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I use it ever morning! It's nice to download music to wake up to. Great app just what I needed
B004T4KKSA|3.0|This book is extremely informative, but also honestly dull.  I am someone working in the industry discussed who is generally very interested in the subject matter, and I can barely keep myself chuggging through this long book.  The writing style is overly repetitive and clinical, which takes some of the fun out of the otherwise very interesting subject matter.  However, the book contains so much insight into the history of the oil industry, it is still a worthwhile read, and I am still glad I am forcing myself to read it.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|love it...everything about its just great...she is a great live<br />singer, and i hope she comes out with something new soon<br />i miss her music so much.
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|Always enjoy Denzel; smooth and real actor regardless of the likability of the character. He's always human. Great action sequences. Unexpected outcome
B005YDLJ76|5.0|i pre-ordered this in anticipation on getting it and i was not<br />dissapointed, beyonce just has it...and i have no idea how<br />her voice stays so clear during her concerts...
B00CSYRHG6|4.0|I love Studio Ghibli's work. This movie is beautiful. The same director for Tales from Earth Sea and Secret World of Arrietti but this time it feels more together than the other two works. If you were disappointed by those two but still love most of the Studio Ghibli library you will most likely like this movie. The characters development is great as well there seems to a be a more believable connection between the characters.<br />Short synopsis: The story follows a close group of friends (mainly Umi) in high school trying to save their historic and run down, clubhouse building. Along the way they discover much more about themselves.<br /><br />***With out spoiling anything I will also add here is a odd moment for a bit of the movie after a revelation is made that may upset some viewers, to that I say keep watching its not what you think.***
B00136LVJO|5.0|soulful, full of rythym and blues, she hits the notes,<br />this is now my favorite album hands down year round<br />her voice is amazing on this cd.
B00DDXJRJG|4.0|Very nice and very useful. Makes the sound more robust on the android platform... and now I can even understand what people are singing about or playing where it wasn't that clear before!
B0017DJ3UW|5.0|i have bought this album maybe 4 times because i keep losing it..<br />so that should tell you this is my number 1 to go to xmas album<br />year round...mariah voice is at its best  on this cd
B000059RNA|5.0|Great series.that's almost impossible to get in Canada these days.  I you love Gerry Anderson, you have to add this one to your collection.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|i was really shocked that i enjoyed this music as much as i did<br />i was not expecting to really like the album like i did and its<br />my go to music at the gym.
B003498SDA|4.0|Great movie with Mr. Cruise and Mr. Foxx.  Both are excellent actors and the film keeps you moving.  This would be a great file for a sequel if everyone were on board with it.
1400069289|5.0|I read this from the library and thoroughly enjoyed reading the many stories within this book. The title to me is not catchy, nor does it identify the content.  After reading, I bought two books as gifts - highly recommended!
B00FWLSLJ4|2.0|Awful Writing, relatively bad acting.  Terrible story.  Just dumb. Hard to screw up prehistoric monsters vs giant robots but they managed to do it.
B00ED2EMJQ|5.0|This is one of the finest live recordings EVER! Definitely Alvin Lee at his best. I would rate this up there with The J Geils Band Live,  Grand Funk Live, and Deep Purple's Made in Japan as one of those albums that is a must for any serious music collector.<br />The quality of this recording is unmatched as far as I am concerned. &#34;Help Me&#34; is one of those tunes that I can't get enough of. I will miss Alvin and his music very much.  Long Live Ten Years After.......
B00CHCUR9I|3.0|I am a fan of tv series walking dead and thought I would take a chance on the comic.  Since the series is in its forth or fifth season, character development is much more progressed than in the comic. It was very strange to see a still optimistic and semi innocent Rick. However I was disappointed that the comic was not in color. I docked one star for that. Comics should be in color!!!!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Cool game really fun to pass time and it is a coin game so you can buy weapons vehicles and planes and submarines
B007TNS6JI|1.0|This game sucks when me and my friend tried to play together and the game crashes plz fix and i will give 5 stars
B000FCK65W|5.0|The story sucked you in.  You fell in love with the character's spunk and optimism.  I enjoy reading about people who overcome difficult obstacles and make the most out of them!
1451696191|5.0|This book is absolutely beautiful. What Stephen Chbosky has been able to portray in the life of Charlie and his new found friends is incredible, and beautifully detailed and personal.<br /><br />Charlie is starting High School and many things have happened since then, including the suicide of his best friend and death of his Aunt. Starting high school was a challenge but with his new found friends, Sam and Patrick, Charlie will experience an emotional roller coaster involving sex, love, drugs, relationships and finding out who he is.<br /><br />This book is a master piece, how close you can feel towards the characters, feel their pain and emotions is amazing. If you've ever gone to High School, then you can understand this book, because chances are that you've lived through it.
1250038820|5.0|Good book...A bit different to the normal reading.
B00CEZJT2E|5.0|Extremely efficient and portable.  Charged two phones and a Walkman on one charge.  How did I ever survive without it?
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|What a GREAT read.. and some very cool experiments. I fully suggest you try them and really honor yourself in putting aside all doubts and believing there is more power in us than what society has taught us to be.... very easy to follow.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Branium's great graphics and extensive scoring information provide endless entertainment. They deserve lots of credit for the care they take in making their games.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another great story!  I love those stories from Ford County!!  Seems like a slower pace of life with real life events.  More of this!!
B00ERIUO02|4.0|Good music but unlike her previous album I just don't have multiple favorites.  The god mentions, scriptures and rhyme of blood orange sun feel crowbarred in.  It is as if she wrote them quickly and never got to go back to let the songs simmer and mature.<br /><br />Katycats may purchase with no regard and shall be pleased.<br /><br />Wife chimes in that it sounds too generic pop, not enough Katy
B00GHJ77KO|5.0|Simple the best Lady Gaga continues to prove what a talented artist she really is!<br />can't wait to hear the rest
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Great storyline pulling old and new together.  The special effects were really good as is expected with any movie with Stat Trek in the title.
B00C5R7B0I|3.0|I was kinda disappointed with this book. It didn't keep my interest like her other books. The characters seemed too complacent not much going on with them. I skipped through a lot of the wordy description about the color of the sky , and the various smells. Don't buy this book get it at the library or wait till is really cheap.
B00AFPVPDG|1.0|The first few chapters have some interesting information on skill acquisition but the book quickly turns into an overly detailed account of Kauffman's own efforts.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Absolutely sucks you in, impossible to put down. Great action drama and of course the romance between Gale and peeta
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I love this movie! I love the book! I'm a sucker for these films. I can't wait for all of the sequels!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Such an awesome game but every time 'upgrade' comes up it does a back and forth thing. Really hope it gets fixed, I would greatly appreciate your hard work zynga!! :) Love this game!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved this book.  The story took an unexpected twist that I was not expecting.  The characters and storyline are all very well developed.
B004TN7QPG|4.0|works great with Epub and pdf books. I use magazines with references inside text. I always need those &#34;easy access&#34; references for commenting.
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|This movie has some great twists and turns. We highly recommend it, in fact we bought it the day we rented it because we love it so much.
B00F88U4J6|3.0|Good, just can't stand the distracting advertising, went Pro. Pro is DEFINIITELY worth it!  You can learn the ropes from this one before using the Pro edition.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|If you've wondered if you should read this series, then that's all you need to know to begin doing so. Amazing read.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|Good for quick access of material, I believe Adobe would Rock if epub would be incorporated into this reader that allows for &#34;in text&#34; reference lookup.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|so glad Kindle finally has Candy Crush! fun and addictive! same as the one you get on other devices. great way to pass time
B0018CENUC|5.0|When it comes to music, he is an outstanding artist.  This arrangement is 35 excellent selections and I'm glad I bought this.
B000NY12CI|5.0|It is a very powerful book and I learned a lot about Muslims. Ayana  is an amazing writer. What a life she has led
8866135704|5.0|Once you go Moleskine, you don't go back. The products are always well made, the right size and you can find pretty much whatever style fits your needs. The special editions are always cool (I wish I'd known they were going to do this one in Lego before I got the plain black).<br /><br />They've added a few new pages to the front again for the new year, though the stickers are still the same (and I still have most from last year left over).
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John green captures what it is to be human, young, in love and dying. It's truthful and inspiring. I love this book.
159562015X|5.0|I found it very enlightening and a good reference to understand what gives me the most satisfaction in work and how to make the most of what I don’t enjoy so much.
B008JFUS8M|5.0|While watching the Hunger Games: Catching Fire, I had watched as two separate viewers: The Book Purist and The Film Goer.  Now from both standpoints I was miraculously impressed. In all honesty, there were a number of changes that I had hoped for improvement from the book, such as the scenes of devastation and an increase in the tension between Katniss and President Snow.  Everything was delivered as promised and surprisingly every new actor brought into the franchise more than delivers their parts. Finnick  is just as outgoing and likable as as in the novels and Johanna most certainly stands out strongly. Even Mags was very polite and a joy to have on screen. Johanna Mason is cheeky and angry as in the novel and impressively just as brash. Sadly, since you must cut things in translation for film, several of those same characters have had to have their back stories cut, which is sad, but manageable. Out of all the new actors established in this sequel the most amazing was Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Plutarch Heavensbee. As one who has read the novel I was able t pick up on the subtleties that floated in the film and every moment that Hoffman is on scene he brings a certain mysteriousness and impressive acting out of his character. Not only does he seem menacing in the right ways, but also his motivations are so behind a veil that you actually want to know more about him and hang onto every bit of information gleaned from his mouth. His scenes with Donald Sutherland are nothing short of brilliant. Watching two veteran actors bounce off of each other and build scenes in this franchise is a welcome respite in it's quiet moments.<br /><br />This is not to single out what the new film adds to the franchise and ignore the old. All of the original cast gets to shine through just as brightly as the new comers. Honestly, Jennifer Lawrence only serves to impress more and more as Katniss. She strengthens the character in this film and the added moments of post traumatic stress in the film only serve to give her more time to display the character in displays of raw emotion. Elizabeth Banks actually has more time in this film to portray Effie as more than just a social climber and example of the ample wealth in the capital, she gets to display her love for her tributes and the time she's had with them. Woody Harrelson has the moments of shining in this film over the last. Having him capable of openly working with the characters prior to their plight instead of spending part of the film as the comic relief. Sadly, Haymitch has his &#34;Origin&#34; story cut from the film as Katniss learns it in the novel. Perhaps it will be used in the next films as Mockingjay is being cut into two separate films, I would love it used as an explanation used for Haymitch's motivations. I was most impressed by the use of Josh Hutcherson's actions as Peeta. He brings a certain charm and realism to the character that I truly believe no one else could. He serves as a softer influence to Katniss than Liam Hemsworth's Gale. This is not to be confused, gone are the days of the helpless Peeta, he has his shining moments during the action sequences of being able to take care of himself and partially be a leader. The moments between Katniss and Peeta feel more real and less forced than the last film which is always an improvement. Overall, regardless of the fantastic story, the actors both new and Old are what brought this film full circle.<br /><br />Acting aside the film is obviously improved by the much larger focus on budget and special effect. As the story calls for multiple special effects shots, I felt as a frequent movie goer, that the effects in this are very much improved from the lackadaisical glossy looks of the first. SFX buildings look sharp and real and even the creature effects are strong. The arena itself is fantastical and almost exactly as I had pictured it in my mind from the book. Overall the nearly doubled budget obviously did everything to improve the films overall quality. I can't honestly explain how good it is without explaining that despite a few moments of missing out on the subtle differences in the novel. These are smaller moments that were surprising improved by boltering moments of rebellion and strengthening of sequences in the movie. I've never seen a movie attempt to out do the book as well as I did here.<br /><br />9.6 out of 10<br /><br />+Better SFX<br />+More Character Driven Moments<br />+New cast of Characters<br />+Philip Seymour Hoffman<br /><br />-Sequences cut from the book.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Easy read, great story well written, twists and turns, intrigue, suspense hard to put down. Highly recommended, another Grisham success.

B00B0LPWU6|3.0|Not one of his better performances. Hated the premise of the story and the conclusion of the story was questionable.

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Well priced high perfomance gaming mouse. The software is a breeze to set up and the keystroke progamability of the 3 buttons more then handles my gaming needs for FPS games. Highly reccomended.
B000FC1LOC|5.0|I could not stop talking about this book. I absolutely loved it! The plot and the story line was amazing. It takes a controversial issue and brings it to life in the eyes of a little girl that finally said enough is enough.
B00G32QIEG|3.0|It was ok. it needed to be slightly more engaging. The movie seemed to have a few times where it was difficult to keep my interest.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|This game is quite enjoyable &amp; the kids love it! It keeps them quite entertained &amp; competitive. Great fun! Recommended for any age.
B00GLX0Z8C|5.0|It was hilarious, highly recommend it. But it does revolve around drugs, so if that bothers you then better stay away.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|awesome graphics really good for kids love how it has characters from the movie. really fun and adivtive so much fun
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book is an amazing ending to the trilogy. All your questions will be answered. The characters you have grown to love are fully revealed and a few change in ways you never saw coming. I only wish this wasn't the end of the story!
B00FGM0JTY|5.0|The music!  And the documentary makes clear the intertwined roots of various Deep South musical genres from Percy Sledge and Aretha Franklin to the Allman Brothers and Traffic.

B00FRQ32N4|4.0|The only problem I found with this game is the energy.<br />It only gives you 5 energy and I run out fast cause I LOVE this game. And also it kept on telling me &quot;download failed &quot; so I had to restart the download quite a few times. -Kindle Fire
B0087JTAKW|5.0|To me it started a little slow but shortly after the beginning, I couldn't put it down. I love the life lessons quotes. It's a great reminder to appreciate each day and to not take things for granted. First book of this that I've read,I can't wait to read all his other works.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|This charging system works great for traveling.  I like the fact that I don't need to carry around the special charging cable this headset.  Just pop it into the case for a recharge.  I never run low on a headset charge.

B009SJ3GUK|5.0|At first,  I thought it would be a continuation of the first  season.  Not so. But the fresh plot is currently blowing my effing mind. Definitely a must see! I bought it on the Amazon instant app on my smart TV.  BEST. PURCHASE. EVER.
B00364K6YW|5.0|Excellent adaptation.  Faithful to the book.  First-rate acting and interesting &#34;extra&#34; features.  Definitely a DVD that I will cherish and not lend to anyone!

B00992CF6W|5.0|THIS is THE best game ever. I feel like my life is complete. BEWARE: extremely addicting. Very fun and creative. It allows me to build to my. Hearts content
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Could not put this book down once I started reading it.  The imagination and wisdom of Suzanne Collins is amazing in this series.  You'll fall in love with the characters and your heart will break as they go through the horrific struggles of their survival.
B00B1E6FF8|3.0|Loved the movie.  I really hate the way UltraViolet digitial copy works. You have to log on twice. It's very cumbersome.  So you don't actually have a  copy on your computer. You have to go to the UltraViolet site and log on then they send you to the Sony site and have to log on.  Just plain stupid. Would prefer a copy on my computer. Plan on just purchasing it from ITunes next time.
1452126577|2.0|Would love it except they used the sane few pictures over and over again. There are tons of photos they could have used. Disappointed.

B005IQZB14|5.0|Entertaining read ! It Makes you think about achieving your own dreams. I would recommend this book to a friend.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I read this book for my book club; it is not a book that I would ordinarily select for myself.  The characters are, for the most part, not likeable nor are they very believable.  At many points in the story, the actions of the characters do not make much sense.  Nevertheless, there are several truly surprising developments in the story, so it works well as a thriller.  The writing style is engaging, and it is well-executed.  I recommend it to readers who like mysteries with twists.
B00FVVR2ZO|4.0|I didn't know this was an everyday game but I'm enjoying it anyways. Going to play for a couple days to see if I don't have to add to Facebook. I don't like that!

1250038820|5.0|So interesting, and great to have on the coffee table.  A great insight to the streets of New York.  Wonderful!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|An powerful insightful look at the horrors of war,  with death as the omniscient and omnipresent narrator - a young girl endures loss after wrenching loss, but somehow survives with her spirit intact.
B00FAVRHBE|5.0|The best epsiode I loved that Tom Baker was at the end that was great he is my<br />doctor. I also liked the two mini epsiodes as well the were great.

0810971496|5.0|Daughter loves this. It promotes reading and writing. She's only six so I was surprised at how easily she filled in the questions.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Epic Fantasy!<br /><br />George R.R. Martin is definitely the Master when it comes to Fantasy. This has got to be one of the best books I've ever read! Everything you can think of or even imagine happens in this book. Lots and Lots of drama, humor, deceit, love, war, horrifying creatures, magic, and death. The action is non-stop and had my head reeling with excitement and a captivation to ever detail at each turn of the page.<br /><br />The characters are so real like that you can hardly believe you are reading the book. I felt as if I was watching a movie as the words became visionary and very real. The chemistry and character building is brilliant, you will definitely love and hate some of them.<br /><br />There is so much going on it is hard to state everything that happens in this 800 page book so I won't even try to explain. I haven't watched any of the episodes on HBO but my family and friends have stated that the shows are equal to the book. I plan to watch them after I have read all 5 books currently available Nov 2013.<br /><br />The ending is perfect leaving the reader with a great surprising gift after all the horrifying tragedies but at the same time I couldn't wait to dive into the second book immediately.<br /><br />Excellent Read!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Better than the original and I don't run out of energy! Keep it that way please! Some people don't play these games so I wish it only showed friends that do for gifts.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Love this series and this season did not disappoint.  Great price to have my own copies of it!  Will continue to buy them here on Amazon.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Lovely modern fairy tale about magic and magical places and the things that bind us to them and to one another
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I'm so sad the story of Tobias and Tris is over. I think there should be one more book about life after all the changes.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Just started playing. I'm hoping it lives up to the reviews.<br />I'll have to rate later after I play more.
B0035YDM4Y|2.0|Not a bad read, and that is all I can say about this book, a bit dicey I think in parts
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I absolutely hate the new version of this app. It is not user friendly at all. I loved it just the way it was&hellip; really not understanding why it was changed in the first place. YOU DON'T FIX SOMETHING WHEN ITS NOT BROKEN!!! I am deleting this app from my Kindle.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is an excellent game.  The mission are easy at first, then they get  harder as you go.  I would definitely recommended this game.

B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I really enjoy playing this game. The graphics are fabulous. It is an improvement over the FB version. I don't have to wait for energy. I don't need to add neighbors.
B00E7SFAAG|2.0|Shows granny falling down many times.  May not be a suitable example for a young toddler.  Mine didn't like it, perhaps when he grows older he will...
B0071XO8RA|1.0|(Contains Spoilers)<br /><br />Wool is a very curious book. Halfway through I had to stop and say to myself, &quot;Hey, wait a minute! What's going on here?&quot; I've been reading science fiction since I was a teenager and still love the genre though I don't read much of it any more. I've read all the classics from &quot;The Time Machine&quot; to &quot;Ringworld.&quot; So &quot;Wool&quot; was not unfamiliar in its general outline and I rather enjoyed the basic concept and the gradual unraveling of the mystery of people trapped in underground cities, without a memory or history of how they came to be and having to find out for themselves. It held my attention. Howey isn't big on characterization or dialogue but science fiction isn't so much about characters as about ideas and the exploration of new worlds. One thing that annoyed me greatly about it was that the author feels compelled to eavesdrop on his characters' thoughts, endlessly. On the other hand he seems to have a natural flair for the dramatic, and it would be a really interesting yarn if he didn't have so much padding which delays the story and gets really boring after while. He's good with surprise and suspense.<br /><br />The writer makes his world and its rules and in the process Howey goes seriously off the track. The world he creates can't possibly work as he describes it. The 'silo' is a huge high-rise of 140 stories buried in the earth, totally self-sufficient. The outside world has been destroyed, the air unbreathable. Everybody who reads the book notices right away that the silo couldn't work without elevators, but there are none. Porters have to sherpa up and down the winding stairs endlessly carrying heavy loads. It is inconceivable that porters, no matter how strong, could lug so much cargo daily to supply so many levels. I kept reading expecting to find out by the end why the silos were designed that way, but there was never any answer. At the same time if you accept that the silos were designed without elevators, the engineering department is supposed to be so capable of repairing and fabricating parts and machinery (they keep the whole silo running and when they rebel make guns and bombs on the fly) that they could have built their own lifts powered by electric motors. Why doesn't anybody ever think of building them? It isn't illegal to talk about elevators as far as I can see.<br /><br />But then there's the problem of fabrication and supply: you have what amounts to a small city with late 20th century technology, complete with computers and all sorts of stuff which degrades over time and has to be replaced. But their only source of raw materials is some mining under the silo (they're not even allowed to dig horizontally) which couldn't possibly supply the needed materials to keep the silo running. Computers have to be maintained but computer parts are highly sophisticated, requiring engineering and manufacturing systems far beyond the capability of the silo's meager engineering department. And of course the required materials for the computer parts would have to come from a global economy which has been wiped out. Same is true of medical supplies and other machinery parts, electrical wire and electric lights. Many of the little mistakes are also annoying, like the fact that radio waves couldn't penetrate from one silo to another underground. Another glitch that caught my attention was the legal assumption that an assassin, having missed his intended target and hitting a bystander, could only be charged with manslaughter. This isn't true in any legal system I know of.  What's the point? It's like a bit of disconnected data that doesn't relate to anything.<br /><br />The silo appears to be run as a totalitarian dictatorship with sham elections. Thought crimes are punishable by death. Something like East Germany or Cuba. What appears to be missing are a visible apparatus of enforcement and an ideology to maintain compliance. IT are the controlling rulers of the silo, a sort of aristocracy that maintains power by keeping people ignorant of the facts of their existence. Though this seems to parallel other dictatorships like the DDR, North Korea or Iran, its aim, its history and purpose are unclear. The Sheriff sends his wife to 'cleaning' without protest though there is no clear reason why he should go along with it. The silo appears operate without any arts, music or entertainment whatsoever and the priests, who have some religious function, seem to have a very minor role. We certainly don't see any mythology or ideology given to the population to explain why things are the way they are.<br /><br />But the biggest letdown for me was that very little of the origins of the silos was explained at the end of the book. I was reading all the way through expecting to be enlightened about how it all came to be, and why, and there is practically nothing. What is hinted at was insane. Evidently some powerful entity, a nation perhaps, decided to destroy the world and everything in it by some unexplained means or device. And why would they do that? Why destroy the world? There is no rational explanation, the people who did it must have been extremely paranoid. But no explanation is even attempted as to what kind of delusions they were suffering under. And the people who destroyed the world were the ones that built the silos. One can imagine the Iranians wanting to blow up the world because they believe the 12th Imam is coming and Paradise awaits them with all those naked virgins, but no such delusions are ascribed to the makers of the silos who were some sort of powerful technocrats. So these guys blow up the world and build 50 'silos' to house a population to repopulate the world if it's ever safe to live on again. The ruling clique (IT) oppresses the majority, denying them any information as to what's outside their silo or how they came to be there. These rules are designed to control the population but are in fact counterproductive because frequent rebellions have already destroyed several silos. All I know is that this book could never have passed inspection at Ray Nelson's writer's group with all those omissions and technical glitches.<br /><br />Reading the book was like reading a complex murder mystery where there are lots of clues and lots of suspects and you come to the end of it and there's no solution! You're left holding the bag. None of the questions are answered. If it's an allegory to some current situation I can't divine it. I'm not saying a backstory couldn't have been devised, but not including one in the book is a copout.s of the silo, a sort of aristocracy that maintains power by keeping people ignorant of the facts of their existence.

B002MG2ATY|5.0|Stone's film, while not factual in every sequence, challenged my thinking and brightly shines the light of doubt on an American cultural myth.
B008JGSM6G|2.0|Once again no instructions on how to play so not fun right off the bat.  PLEASE include instructions within the game.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|Another exciting tale with Jack Reacher figuring out all the ins and outs of human nature and the evil in some people's hearts.  What a ride you go on.  I would highly recommend it...as well as the other 10 that I have read!  If you like mystery, crime, suspense...you will love reading Lee Child's novels.  The Hard Way is one of his best, I think.  Good for men and women.  When I started this one, I could not put it down until I finished the last Reacher victory.
B00G4I1CLS|5.0|This was quite a powerful and moving documentary but it wasn't particularly easy to watch at times.  Sadly, it's just another example of how our culture is becoming increasingly more dominated by corporate greed which values profit over the well being of both humans and animals.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|Good morality play.  The theme of &#34;Flight&#34; was carried of pretty well.  Goodman character was a sort of cartoon and a little distracting.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I have been enjoying playing this version of Mahjong. It was well worth the money and each game gets more complicated.
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|Just another Bleak Future film.  The Producers of the Hunger Games tournament were indeed the producers of the film.  I liked Logan's Run but I saw that when I was young, so perhaps this is meant for a younger audience, as evidenced by the readers of the book.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Super easy set up.  Portable for trips.  Works flawlessly.  Better picture quality than my Blueray. Anticipating more options.  Price point Rocks.  User interface is beautiful.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Very cute game. Easy to use , good controls.  Love the piggy reactions.Only draw back is some levels have very hard constucted devices to help the piggies and their help button sometimes doesn't help.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's a good game for all ages to enjoy and pass the time it teaches you how to take care of animals and be responsible for them
0425252868|5.0|Valiance, integrity, and honor all in one.  Heartwarming and wonderful.  This German pilot is the embodiment of respect for life and human dignity.  A must read.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Love the different challenges. Really works your observation skills and learning different strategies to make moves. I highly recommend this game.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|though I do not enjoy his music nor his heroin habit, still Nikki Sixx is quite an interesting man.  I enjoy learning how other people think, and his journey fascinated me.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Left me scratching my head! This book is like a Twilight Zone episode. I was not expecting such a science fiction story. But, I liked it. It became apparent to me early in the book that there was some time travel going on, but I wasn't expecting the eventual explanation. The last chapter where all of it comes together is really unexpected.
B000JQV68A|5.0|Great story; well written and easy to follow.  Relaxing…. yet stimulating.  I am an adult yet had never read any of F Scott Fitzgerald, and so I went on a Fitzgerald binge; loved it.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Excellent sequel. When they first said that Daniel Craig was the new Bond, I was not too sure about the choice. Through 3 movies, he has made me a believer.
B001NHNG64|5.0|I'm in love with this series. Although I'm only just finishing 2/17 I'm excited to purchase #3 right now. This is the perfect winter book series!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|great product, hard to believe that a device so small and independent can product great wireless quality to my TV.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Waited so long for this app to be available for the kindle! :)  Not those l<br />&quot;Guides&quot; or &quot;how to get it on kindle&quot; app, but the real thing!  Hooray!  Been playing it all day - haven't had any problems so far!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|What a great series!! I am getting ready to read the next book!! Feels to much like 50 shades but oh well. Still like it.
B009SJ3H8Q|3.0|First season is better. Not bad. Does not live up to season 1. Same actors makes it a bit weird.
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|This game is so cool.It is so fun and funny.Who ever made this game is creative and fun.This game is so creatively awesome.
B000GOTESO|4.0|I like Sylvester Stallone and I saw this movie before and I wanted to see it again.  Please do not ask me for reviews on all of the movies I watch via Prime.
B000002GJS|5.0|I had to buy this because my original copy, from about a hundred years ago, was having problems playing.  I loved this CD back in the day and it was fun to listen to again.  The MP3 was included, so that was nice.  I love Thought I'd Died and Gone to Heaven, All i Want Is You, and Don't Drop That Bomb on Me.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game was boarding untill you could log in with facebook and play with your friends.<br />they added despicable me 2 stuff. so its way more fun
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I have a kindle fire HD 1st generation and had no problem downloading or playing this game with the exception of freezing on occasion. After playing for a month or so I have amassed about 1.5 million bananas with only minion launcher to spend them on. Also after placing in the top 1000 in the weekly contest to win 100 coins, can't find how to collect them. Don't have a Facebook account to link to but they sure know how to take your money for coins !<br /><br />Overall fun game but guess it's like all Comcast products as you use them they want more and more money for the same thing
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This app is great! I can't stop playing. Wish I didn't have to keep buying lives. Go try it for yourself.
B003ESKXGG|4.0|The Mondaine Men's A667.30308.16SBB Day Date Leather Band watch feels like our more expensive watches over the 3K entry point. The big dial doesn't obstruct the presentation of a watch that makes a refined statement. You will be veryssatisfied with watch if worn as your daily. The only other upgrade desired on this watch would have been a sapphire crystal which sub $200.00 watches rarely offer. You will be satisfied with this purchase.
B00BESLT6G|3.0|I was hoping that the graphics would be superior to the first movie and was sadly disappointed. The scare factor was not there this time. Might be due to it being a different director.... I will still purchase to add to my horror collection only because it has something to do with the first Silent Hill. Silent Hill (1) is still one of my all time favorite horror films.
0955153077|5.0|I have to say, I've purchased a lot of art books of different styles, and subjects.<br />This has by far, been the best art tutorial book I've ever owned.<br />The first chapter walks you through every last little thought process the artist goes through.<br />The following chapters tackle different styles, and subjects.<br />Then the book ends with a detailed: 'How to draw...' including things like fire, grass, clouds, etc.<br /><br />But the thing I love most, is it shows you how to create your own brushes, and how to figure out when<br />a different brush is needed.  This overcomes my biggest problem with digital art, a lack of texture.<br /><br />I highly recommend this to any beginner to intermediate artist.<br /><br />And, one question I didn't see answered was, what photoshop version is it good for?<br />I have CS3, and even with that old version, I didn't find anything that I couldn't handle.<br />So, no worries.  :)
B003O86FMW|5.0|I started this book not expecting it to be so well done. The ending was quite a surprise, and makes you wonder how the third book will tie it all together.
B003ELKNH2|5.0|This is simply a fantastic movie.  It's eerie and dark, and a bit twisted.  As far as war movies go, it's a good one.  Besides, who doesn't love the smell of napalm in the morning?
B00GO95TAC|5.0|Seriously guys?  Price gouging?  Intellectual property is basically free these days.  There was a time when you had to pay $3 for a VHS tape that you could only keep for three days.  Today, $7.99 and an HD version of this episode is yours to keep.  Sounds like a pretty solid deal to me.  With the Amazon's, iTunes's and Netflix's of the world sucking the profit out of the TV and film industry for all but a few major blockbusters, it's amazing that something with the singular vision of Doctor Who gets made at all (and without product placement to boot!).  I think it's worth an extra $4.
B00AEBB9K0|5.0|You will either love or hate this movie.  If you like Ben Stiller I think you'd like this movie.  It's got some great songs on the soundtrack, an absurdly funny plot, and a number of big name actors in it.<br /><br />This is a great movie to watch if you want to laugh, or you if you need to learn how to blend in with people that are really really really good looking.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So Addicted!! Love this game and have it on my pc, on my kindle and on my iphone. Play it all the time and it works great on my kindle!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Any one that understands the title should appreciate this game.  It's a modern version of an original classic (which you used to aim a crosshair with a track ball and select the left, center or right ammunition pile to shoot from...for anyone who didn't already understand the reference).<br /><br />You get to upgrade your defenses with faster missles, larger explosions, more ammo, etc. which is a nice touch.  The game starts pretty easy, but after a few levels you find yourself experiencing some challenges.  The further you go, the more challenging it becomes....more missles are shot at you, more UFO's come to drop bombs on you, the enemy missles come faster.  As far as I know this isn't a game you can &#34;win&#34;, it's more about how long you can survive.<br /><br />I'm a fan of the classic and this is a good, modern clone.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I didn't get the hang of it. Would have been a lot of fun, but I just couldn't get the dang thing to run or go in the right direction.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Not too shabby for a free app... would recommend for younger kiddos<br />And any animal lover. Takes minimal work to keep the horses Alive
B0081ISUOG|1.0|It is nothing more than a stopwatch.  Yes, it has a timer on the menu but when you select it, it reverts to the stopwatch.  Whomever coded this piece of junk needs to find a new career.

B00A8ECU24|1.0|Soo adorable but would not respond to commands. Also would not allow me to ever exit game. When I was using other functions on my Android phone, the game was constantly running with reminders at the top. Uses up sooo much memory :/ hope they fix it soon..my daught looves MLP :)
B005T87QCI|3.0|I think it is really fun. I love it. It is awesome. My soso and soso love it. I play it on my Wii and phone and kindle and Xbox.
0385537131|3.0|This was the first time I received anything that was not packaged to perfection.  Both books were received warped and damp.  VERY disappointed!  When I tried to report the situation, I kept running into roadblocks until very flustered, I gave up!

B00BD99JMW|5.0|I choose this rating because I like the twists of what happened at the end of how you made the main character die and it just stopped my heart I will really miss your books and I hope you can give me tickets to all the premier's of all the movies they make write back : )
B00FPGSPQU|5.0|The video played very well and I was surprised by how clear it was. I will rent more. I think that it should have been extended for more time in case you start and can't finish. My son got to see the whole movie though while we were travelling.

B00GH4RKYM|4.0|Well done movie. I have now watched it like 6 times so I am kind of bored with it lol. I think Henry Cavill makes a great Superman and I love Amy Adams as Lois Lane. Well done movie that shows that being Superman is not easy. Were much is given, much is required.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|Great acting on the part of Denzel Washington, gripping story, a bit too directly moralistic, yet definitely worth the time watching
B00GO95TAC|5.0|Steven Moffat is at his mind-bending best here.  I was so sure it would be impossible to live up to the hype, but Day of the Doctor managed to do it for me.  A few very minor quibbles don't detract from the overall awesome ride.  I could watch Matt Smith and David Tennant all day and not tire of them.
B0027BOL4G|4.0|Very informative.  Note that for many years I have wondered if the hormones and antibiotics put into these animals before slaughter has brought about the rage in our children (and adults) and the resistance to drugs many if not most bacteria have aquired.
B00GLX1MG6|4.0|Funny movie -- great chemistry between all four of these &#34;non-family&#34; members thrown together for their purpose.  Jennifer Anniston is very hot and sexy in one part of this movie -- hold onto your hat!
1455521310|5.0|After the disappointing True Blue, the last few Baldacci books have been better, but this one is just great! I read military-political-espionage thrillers a lot. The plots can be predicable, but not this one.  Surprises and shocks all the way through.  Baldacci is on top if his game with this book.
B00EQK5OG0|5.0|This review is of the Waterboys &#34;Fisherman's Blues Deluxe Edition&#34; a birthday present that arrived with angels wings. It is difficult to recall today the sniffy response this album received on release. It was seen by many as a deviation from the &#34;Big Music&#34; which Mike Scott had driven so hard and with such passion on previous releases. It was argued that &#34;Fisherman's Blues&#34; was a sharp rupture from the Waterboys previous output; a unfortunate dalliance with &#34;traditionalism&#34;. In fact it was a logical continuation of Scotts great vision. The brilliant &#34;This is the Sea&#34; is full of Celtic inflections and he was always a musical magpie drawing from an astonishing gamut of styles and influences. What is fascinating about this release is the sheer scale of experimentation, exploration and emotion that went into constructing a single album. &#34;Fishermans box&#34; proves that Scott, Wickham, Thistlethwaite and comrades in effect recorded the &#34;Irish Basement Tapes&#34;. It is a magnificent box, VFM in spades and if the packing quality could have been notched up a ratchet or two, the music implores us to live with the shame. Below is a review of the six main discs of the box set. The primary source for much of the information is the detailed analysis in the excellent booklet in the set plus the Waterboys web site (well worth checking out)) onto which this reviewer has added some personal thoughts.<br /><br />CD 1 was recorded in its entirety on Jan 23 1986, the first day of the Fisherman's Blues sessions. Thus begins a journey for the band in to new territory which was ill understood by critics who roundly berated the departure from the powerhouse rock of &#34;A Pagan Place&#34; and the anthems of &#34;This is the sea&#34; in what was described by one critic at the time as a &#34;descent into a folk backwater&#34;. Scott admits that he had become obsessed with Irish music although the songs on this desk are an electric mix of old country and gospel numbers plus new originals. Two of the tracks &#34;Fisherman's Blues&#34; and the cover of Van Morrison's &#34;Sweet Thing&#34; are remasters from the original album and sound great. The cover of Dylan's &#34;Girl from the north Country&#34; is excellent but has been aired before ditto &#34;Meet me at the station&#34; Of the unreleased stuff the cover of Hank Williams &#34;I'm so lonesome I could cry&#34; is workmanlike but the piano version of &#34;World Party&#34; is a joy. The highlight however is a 10 minute long feast of the live staple &#34;Saints and Angels&#34; finally released in album form.<br /><br />CD 2 was recorded between March and September 1986 in Dublin's Windmill Lane Studio. You can hear Scott and co really beginning to breath out and expand their musical reach. The period sees them jumping with musical ease from country, blues and folk music. It opens with one of the greatest Waterboys songs the sheer power of &#34;We will not be lovers&#34; now at its remastered best. It remains an inescapable puzzle of life why &#34;Too Close To Heaven&#34; was left off the main album unless its length just precluded inclusion. Scott's obsession with Hank Williams continues with a nice version of &#34;Lost Highway&#34; which in turn impacted on later songs Bonny Bramlett's and Leon Russell's &#34;Lonesome and a long way from home&#34; being a case in point. The bulk of tracks on this disc are previously unreleased and whilst including some fragments highlights include the prototype &#34;Higherbound&#34; and a rousing version of &#34;Will the Circle be unbroken&#34;.<br /><br />CD 3 was recorded Dec 2-7 1986 in Fantasy Studios, California, with producer Bob Johnston and with access to range of top notch US session musicians not least the brilliant drummer Jim Keltner. As for the songs the great remaster of &#34;Lonesome Old Wind&#34; sounds superb and gives further proof what a great singer Mike Scott is. Ditto the pounding sax driven &#34;Blues for your baby&#34;. Ok the cover of the Beatles &#34;Sgt Peppers&#34; was clearly great fun in the studio but perhaps should have stayed there. Yet taking the rough with the smooth is the key to enjoying this box set. Alternatively the early version of &#34;You in the sky&#34; is a clear equal to the smoother remaster. This disc also majors on prototype versions of several songs and another 11 tracks are previously unreleased.<br /><br />CD 4 was recorded between December 1986 & February 1987. The nucleus of the Fisherman's blues sound is too be found on this disc not least in the stunning &#34;I will meet you in heaven again&#34; and the in particular Waterboys classics like the 11-minute &#34;Higher In Time Symphony&#34;. This is a song which suggests that FB should have at least been a double on release. &#34;The Golden Age&#34; actually sounds like a mix of alt country and Irish music while Anton Thistlethwaite singing on &#34;Billy The Kid&#34; should convince Scott to hand the microphone over more regularly. A fair chunk of this disk was on the 2006 remaster and &#34;Higherbound&#34; is not quite perfected on this disk. 10 tracks here are previously unreleased.<br /><br />CD 5 was recorded Feb-Sept 1987, mostly in Dublin's Windmill Lane. &#34;Higher bound&#34; is completely signed, sealed and delivered at last. Songs like the earlier version of &#34;When will be married&#34; are more traditionally Irish than the final album versions, It contains unreleased songs and nice versions of the album mainstays &#34;Fisherman's Blues&#34; and &#34;Strange Boat&#34; which has a slightly Phil Spectorish ambience to it. Granted the blues version of &#34;If I cant have you&#34; is solid but not necessarily a key track and on this disk the recorded studio foolery sees tracks like &#34;Headphone mix song&#34; wearing a bit thin. Yet who can deny that overall Disc 5 is one of the key culmination stages on this musical journey with 12 tracks here are previously unreleased.<br /><br />CD 6 contains all the recordings made at Spiddal House, near Galway, in the spring of 1988. The Celtic folk influences scream out of this disc which has the highest level of previously unreleased tracks - some 17 songs altogether. Indeed this is &#34;Fisherman's Blues&#34; evolving into &#34;Room to Roam&#34; with two versions on the disk of that albums &#34;In Search of the Rose&#34; (which Scotts perfectionism took to 99 takes) and an early &#34;Spring comes to Spiddal&#34;. It contains a nice version of the classic Scottish folk song &#34;Twa Recruiting Sergeants&#34; a song popularised by The Corries and the evolution of Yeats &#34;Stolen Child&#34; which finally evolves from piano and vocal demo to full recording. It also confirms emphatically that &#34;When Ye Go Away&#34; is truly one of Scott's greatest songs. The version of Guthrie's &#34;This Land is your Land&#34; is rather disposable but rounding the whole thing is off with a sweet version of Dylan's &#34;Bucket of Rain&#34; from &#34;Blood on the Tracks&#34; is a nice touch.<br /><br />And so the curtain comes down on a musical feast of the highest order. It was the producer Richard Curtis who once boldly ventured the opinion that 'I'm starting to feel, to my own surprise, that the Waterboys are the next best group after the Beatles&#34;. Perhaps a claim to far but at the same the ongoing misperception in some quarters of this band as some sort of hazy 1980s relic is a criminal understatement of Mike Scott's musical importance and premier status in the canon of rock music. With &#34;Fisherman's Box&#34; there is now tangible and overwhelming proof of the Waterboys standing as one of the most important British bands of the past 25 years and fully achieved their aim of producing &#34;The Big Music&#34;. You really do struggle to think of other musicians who embarked on such an authentic eclectic pilgrimage that took in so many pit stops and which led to such joyous quality outcomes. &#34;Fishermans Box&#34; is a true event.br /><br />CD 6 contains all the recordings made at Spiddal House, near Galway, in the spring of 1988.

B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Cuts to the chase on means of spiritual growth. A good read. Speaks of means of maintaining personal integrity and growth in a world corrupted by lies and faulty belief systems
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I read this book because it was recommended to me and because  I was determined to finish it before the movie came out. I had no dislikes on this book I fell in love with the whole thing from the moment  I started reading. I would recommend this book to anyone who  likes a little bit of action with a good amount of romance. You should probably like fantasy too.
B005H29GSI|5.0|Somehow I made the mistake of promising my 4-year-old an Angry Birds birthday cake without ensuring I could buy one. The local groceries didn't do Angry Birds, so I ended up buying this game and using the pieces as a cake topper.  Which, for the record, works pretty well (just tape straws or toothpicks below the pieces to hold them up).  As a bonus, both of my kids also really like the game, so it's really just been a win-win all around.
B000PAAH3K|2.0|This book has a fascinating premise, but is plagued by overly wordy examples and poor writing style. One of the main points that the author is trying to make is that an excess of unnecessarily detailed information reduces our chance of coming to the 'right' conclusion or decision. Ignoring his own insight, he belabors almost every point to such an extent that the reader is forced to skim through or even skip entire sections.<br />In addition, the chapter highlighting Ekman's work assumes a that the reader has a detailed knowledge of facial anatomy and is well versed in Ekman's facial expression coding system. The lessons that could have been gleaned from that chapter were lost.<br />I'm definitely NOT impressed and won't be purchasing another worry by this author.
B0028MBKVG|4.0|Excellent analogy of the history of running, and man's natural design for it. The storyline leads up toward a major underground ultrarunner event that has an amazing outcome! This is a must read for anyone who has ever enjoyed the sport of running!
B000002UAR|5.0|Awesome - Awesome - Awesome!  I cannot say it enough.  These guys were so creative and resourceful, no one has been able to top them.  When they were popular, there was no internet, no MTV and no cable television.  We had am radio, 5 main stations on our televisions complete with rabbit ears, and no other avenue to hear their work.  So, if anyone says pop artists of today have topped the Beatles sales and popularity, it's all a joke.  Do some research regarding how they reached their audiences.  Remember the Ed Sullivan Show?  How about  American Bandstand?<br />Have been a Beatles fan for 48 years!  And, will continue til the day I die.

1439102813|5.0|Love, love, love Still Alice!  This is a book about Alice and how Alzheimer's affected her from beginning to end.  Don't know if it is an actual true story, but I'm sure some of these things have happened to many Alzheimer's patients.  This story made me laugh and cry and left me just wondering why and how this disease came about.  It is definitely a MUST-READ for those of you interested in the disease itself.

B00DYVUBYM|3.0|Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.<br /><br />Every moviegoer undoubtedly has their own set of performers they would see in anything. The movie itself can be panned by critics and audiences alike, but that won’t stop them from watching it anyway. Although I don’t have many, Emma Watson definitely makes my list, and as a result I had to sit through 90 minutes of The Bling Ring. I knew going in that this probably wasn’t going to resonate with me in any way, shape, or form, but Ms. Watson was in it, and that was really all the motivation I needed to sit down and watch it. As a film, The Bling Ring attempts to portray a message of idolization, but the content is so shallow that it’s hard to take it too seriously.<br /><br />Based on real events, The Bling Ring attempts to tell the story of the infamous(?) Bling Ring, a group of young adults who went around robbing the homes of celebrities. What starts as a somewhat innocent escapade quickly turns into an obsession as the audience gets to watch these teenagers rob house, after house, after house. Although the movie centers on this ensemble cast, most of the focus seems to be put on Marc Hall (Israel Broussard), a quiet teen who suffers from social anxiety—he’s also the only character I actually liked, to some extent. Unfortunately, things spiral out of control when the ringleader Rebecca Ahn (Katie Chang) finds herself addicted to the rush, and the cold hand of karma slaps the group in the face.<br /><br />What bothered me most about this film is that there seemed to be a strong lack of direction and genuine motivation. From start to finish, The Bling Ring is a chaotic blur of drugs, alcohol, partying, and robbing, which left me feeling empty and disengaged. To make matters worse, while it manages to tell its story well enough, the narrative that’s weaved through these 90 minutes isn’t terribly interesting. Once I was 15 minutes into the movie I found that I didn’t care about these characters or their story, after 45 minutes I still didn’t care, and by the end of it my indifference hadn’t changed. Once the credits began to roll I began to feel physically ill as I remembered that this is based off something that happened, and that these were real people. It’s disgusting.<br /><br />In addition, there is little-to-no character development to be found here, as these self-entitled brats clearly don’t care about anyone, or anything, but themselves. As I said before, the only person I genuinely cared about was Marc, and that’s only because he was only doing this out of some misguided obligation. He’s insecure about himself and his abilities, which is why he finds himself so obligated to go along with Rebecca because he finally has someone who gives him some attention—he’s also the only one who shows any kind of humane qualities while robbing these people. You could always tell that he really didn’t want to be part of their shenanigans, and he genuinely seemed bothered by their actions.<br /><br />Where this film truly shines, though, is in its cast. While The Bling Ring may not have the most interesting story, the cast portraying these individuals did a phenomenal job of exemplifying the worst of our youth. Chang and Broussard both gave convincing performances, and Chang showed a lot of potential as an actress. In addition, Watson performed wonderfully as Nicki Moore. Although I don’t totally agree with the high praise she’s been given for this role, there’s no denying that she played the stuck-up, spoiled character really well. Another standout was Claire Julien, who plays Chloe Tainer. This is another up-and-comer who showed a lot of promise with her performance, and hopefully she starts getting offered more roles in the future.<br /><br />Finally, although I personally hated every piece of music used in the film, The Bling Ring's soundtrack does an exceptional job of portraying the fun, care-free attitude of these teens. It's loud, obnoxious, and upbeat, which sets the perfect tone for the scenes and situations present in the movie. Consisting of music from Rick Ross, Kanye West, M.I.A., and Azealia Banks, this soundtrack is only going to appeal to a select group of individuals. However, ignoring its contribution to the film would be a disservice to those who worked on putting it together. The music doesn't have to be mind-blowing to be considered a good soundtrack, it just has to fit within the context of the story, and The Bling Ring more than accomplishes this task.<br /><br />Overall Score: 5/10 - Although The Bling Ring attempts to showcase a message about society’s obsession with celebrities, it never fully executes the task. Instead, it settles on a mediocre story about a group of very unlikable teens, and the film suffers greatly because of it. All it really accomplished was bringing more attention to this group when their 15 minutes of fame should have been over long ago. In the end, the only redeemable quality would be the performances from the cast, but other than that I can’t say this is something I would watch again. However, if you’re curious about it I would suggest a rental, but you shouldn’t go out of your way to see it.

B00G7QPTR0|5.0|Beyoncé is undoubtedly one of the most guarded celebrities I've ever encountered. However, I appreciate 'Life Is But a Dream' because she finally opens up and reveals the personal facet of her life you don't see often.<br /><br />From being a world-class entertainer to a daughter, mother, and wife, Beyoncé's life is like a fairy tale on the surface. The documentary is a compelling story that shows that her ascent to the top wasn't as easy as it seems, and took a lot of hard work.<br /><br />The singer tells her story in her own words, carefully addressing rumors, sharing her intimate thoughts, and reminding you that she's human. Love her or hate her, Beyoncé has indeed left her mark on the world.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Sanderson creates a new and fascinating world with characters that only barely begin to unfold as the book concludes. There are people to hate, people to confuse, and champions to cheer.<br />While this is a complete book do not expect that you will have resolution by the end of it. This is clearly the opening salvo of a fantasy epic in the true sense if the genre.<br />Fantastically fun and engaging in the way a master story-teller spins an entirely new world without stopping to explicitly explain it.<br />One word of caution: be prepared to get drawn into a world that is yet incomplete for the next decade as Sanderson continues to write it.
B00GO95TAC|5.0|I loved it. Yes the price was a bit high(even more since i made the mistake of hitting the wrong button), but when you consider what it would cost to see it in theaters does it really matter?  Yes I could wait for it to hit DVD, BBC America, or even for someone to post it online and save a few bucks. But I wanted it now and, for what i paid, I Gladly traded seeing it on the big screen for the comfort of my own home.

B003G4W49C|5.0|Very good book. Not as much action as I expected, but instead gets into the mind of Andrew Wiggen. It is hard to believe that these future military heroes were just children, but since the commands were given in a video game environment it becomes more understandable. The mental toll taken on these children is explored as well as the realization that the war could have been avoided. There is so much adults could learn from children if they just listen.

B000002NAK|5.0|The musical score was produced by the most accomplished of composers and the orchestration stays true to the original score.  It's a moving production that conveys the spirit of Latin America beautifully.  Though I suppose I'm not an expert with Latin American studies, I have visited and I know of the appeals of South America, and also the ails that are still common there today.
0316228532|4.0|There were a lot of people who did not like this book and I can't understand why. It was an amazing story of a whole town and instead of learning about just one person you got to learn about all the different people who made the town and how it came together. Yes it was sad, but it looked at the town in a whole new perspective. In the beginning of the book J.K Rowling introduces a lot of different people, but that isn't any different from Agatha Christie, and Joyce Carol Oates. They both introduce a lot of people in their novels as well, and it does make it hard to get everyone straight at first. I will admit that I was going back and finding the initial introduction to make sure that I had the right person but afterwards I found this book to be wonderful.<br /><br />I loved learning about each of the individual people and their back story and how it all came together at the end. If you are looking for a book that is out of the box, and not your normal story then I would recommend this. I think it would be hard if you had to put it down and pick it back up with all of the different people involved. Once I started this book I couldn't put it down, and I loved every page of this story. It was sad, and there were people who you felt terrible for but you also felt that you were part of the town. And you were a bystander as everyone else was moving around you.<br /><br />Give this book a try, you might be surprised that once you get into the thick of the story you wont want it to end. Although, J.K Rowling did an amazing job with the ending.
6304806418|5.0|The movie was orchestrated to perfection and remained true to the original concept conveyed in the musical version.

B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This game reminds me of several others I have played before. There are many differences both good and bad. It would be nice if your forces would gain experience points in strength from winning fights. It would be nice if there were some examples to follow so I wouldn't have to learn everything the hard way. I want to be able to close the game without losing progress. Last issue is the real money things, I am not going to go broke playing a game. Everything else about this game is fantastic. I am addicted to it. As long as things advance without needing all of my money I know I will be playing. I highly recommend giving this game a shot if you like strategy war games. Meet me on the battlefield if your not scared.

B002QVZ71I|4.0|Good movie:  Once again, Tom Hanks outdid himself.  The supporting cast was also excellent. The movie runs a little long, but it's good for one and half bags of popcorn and two bottles of water.  It gets a little weepy in parts but it covers a lot of good ole American history.  The soundtrack is 5 stars all the way. Watch out for the box of chocolate, it'll get to you before the end. My wife and I both liked the movie<br />When we saw  it the first time, it was in a theatre. This time we found an affordable copy in Blue-Ray, on Amazon,  which really enhanced the  at home viewing and boy what sound and the blu-ray real brought out all the video highlights as well.  We see lots of movies every week so I think we're pretty good judges of a movies.  See it for yourself, rent it on Amazon or Netflick and enjoy a good movie.
1401917232|5.0|This is Gary's third book and I really enjoyed it. I blew through it the first time and plan on going back to read more slowly the second time through. Lots of wonderful teachings from Arten and Pursah, some repeated (which is always good) and some really new stuff. I especially liked their recommendations for keeping the body tuned up. There's at least one item which I'd never heard of. These actions keep the ego distracted while the undoing occurs - Cool!

B009XY97VC|5.0|Another great album from these guys and I have collected them all.  Their skill in creating 3-4 minute songs that vary and keep you running is amazing.  The diversity in each album allows imaginations to soar.  I run and write with their music constantly. This album however I deleted a few of the tracks as I didn't care for the vocals namely, 5#: The end is the beginning. And 21#: Back to Earth.  Not my taste and always jar me when they come on.  Otherwise buy this--you will not regret getting any of their albums.

B00FN3HRG4|5.0|Legend.<br />Once you’ve said it, you realize that not even that, nor any accolade in the dictionary, can truly describe the 50 + year phenomenon known as Barbra Streisand.<br />She has been described every way possible – from a diva to demanding.  Her life has been photographed, written about and recorded down to every last nuance.  But nothing, as you will hear when you listen to BACK TO BROOKLY, can accurately detail or even hope to describe the woman and all her talent.<br />I was in the audience when she held a crowded auditorium rapt.  In a world where twenty something youths are holding the reins, it was delightful to see a master of her profession, at a young 70, holding fort.<br />Although she had previously stated that she did not like live performing, this record will show that Barbra Streisand has learned to meet, and conquer, her fears.  The songs – all beautifully sung classics – are delivered with gusto and, in most cases, unrequited joy on the singer’s part.<br />Listen to her playful rendition of Nice ‘n’ Easy or You’re The Top.  Then she puts her heart and soul into her own standards – People, The Way We Were and Evergreen.<br />Her showcasing of Jules Styne hits – with a smattering from Gypsy – manage to take well known songs and present them with a force and power that knock the notes out of the arena as only Barbra Streisand can do.  Hearing her sing Rogers and Hart (Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered) makes you yearn for the golden years where torch singers ruled supreme.  Whatever song, whatever challenge, Ms. Streisand faces it head on and makes the song her very own.<br />The audience that night, and those who listen to this CD, loved every second of the performance.  And the naysayers?  I’ve heard people say she can’t sing like she did 50 years ago – well, age may have slightly shaved off a few of the higher notes but it did not take away the power, volume or masterful control she has of her instrument.  And, nobody can phrase like Barbra Streisand.  Listen to Here’s To Life – she makes it a three act play so that it is an entity unto itself.  Others take delight in the hoarseness.  Here again, the lady awoke with a cold (and bravely did not cancel the performance) but it did nothing to impair or negatively impact the beautiful sounds that are Barbra Streisand singing.  And her political views?  She has always been vocal – you know that so get over it.  Instead of knit-picking and finding fault, why not enjoy the legendary singer who has an unequalled career spanning over 50 years?  A gift like hers comes once in a lifetime and those who have heard her singing in concert, or listen to this record, are truly the luckiest people in the world.ody can phrase like Barbra Streisand.

B00GSE92F6|1.0|Shame on you, Amazon!  Are you so paranoid that people will not shop with you over the holidays that you have to clearly and disgracefully price gouge when you see how much your customers want Doctor Who?<br /><br />This, paired with the fact that you have started shipping our &#34;Free 2 day Prime&#34; items via UPS - by way of USPS, causing as much as a week's delay in delivery, has me thinking that Amazon really is just a big corporate jerk that doesn't mind at all screwing the very customers that keep you in business.  For a time, I thought Amazon might actually care a bit about customer satisfaction.<br /><br />Keep it up, Amazon...you'll be sadly disappointed when we all go elsewhere - you're not the only game in town.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I have just finished this book and I can honestly say I was moved to tears. The author does a great job telling this story. While I am not going to spoil it, it is a must read. This book contains a young girl, foster parents, a lemon haired boy, a hidden Jew, and the grim reaper.
B00CPTUN5G|4.0|Purchased this movie during my three season recap prior to the start of the fourth season. I'll have to say that it was actually an enjoyable movie, regardless of the few problems present in it.<br /><br />First off, the item itself. I had purchased the digital versatile disk (DvD) version of this movie. It comes without a card sleeve, in just a regular plastic disk case we're all use to by now. Also you'll be happy to know there isn't much guff on the inside. Just your movie disk and a quick advertisement for the Equestria Girl dolls. Subtle.<br /><br />The story overall starts out relatively normal, like just any episode would. We start out with six ponies, however as the plot thickens we're faced that we will only follow one of them. That pony is Princess Twilight Sparkle. Yes, any references to other characters in this movie are not the actual characters, but new ones we're meeting for the first time regardless if they seem familiar to us already. So if certain moments feel like de'ja'vu, it's likely because it is.<br /><br />This human isn't Fluttershy. Her name is Fluttershy and is very similar to Fluttershy, but she isn't Fluttershy, she's Fluttershy. Yes that can get confusing fast. Best not to think too hard on it. Suspension of disbelief, use it! You'll need it when watching this movie.<br /><br />Also get ready for a cameo cascade! This movie throws them at you non-stop. Some of them are actually quite funny though, like Wilhelm! Well worth more than one viewing to catch them all.<br /><br />The animation is solid in comparison to the actual show and is actually better in some instances. The fine men and women at DHX really seem to be pushing themselves when it comes to Flash animation. So does this mean we can expect them to just keep getting better? If season four shows us anything, I'd say yes, yes it does.<br /><br />Are there plot holes that stick out a mile high? Yes. Is there logical fallacies that make no sense? Totally! Is the villain poorly done? You be the judge. Is the moral something we've already gone over before in the exact same series several times. You bet! Is this a movie intended for adolescent girls, fans of the show and to serve to launch a new line of toys which are available at your local Target, Toys&#34;R&#34;Us, Wal-Mart, K-Mart, some other mart I've never seen and your very own neighborhood Walgreens as well right here on Amazon.com! If the leaflet insert is any indication, then sure, why not.<br /><br />Should you buy this movie right now? For the price of a dinner at Denny's you wont be left dissatisfied. Unlike eating dinner at Denny's. Regardless of it's issues, it was still a fun and enjoyable movie that takes your beloved characters and puts them into different shoes: literally! It even has a few cute songs in it as well that are enjoyable listening to. That is, if it's not your preferred taste in music, but hey! Everyone's a critique these days! Even me.? You be the judge.

B00AHQNHSY|5.0|I went to a site to view a show, but I had issues. I pasted the &quot;download now&quot; link into stream, and it.worked! I did have to change the recommended setting, though. Instant and fast streaming!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Excellent graphics. Great design. You need not pay to play. One can go far for free. I recommend it highly. Enjoy.
B00BATG18K|3.0|I was really glad to finally get to the end of this.  Would have been much better if shorter.  Just dragged on and on.  I found myself speed reading through many pages.
006202406X|1.0|Honestly, I was so excited for this book. But that ending killed me. The fact that Veronica stated she wasn't thinking of her fans while writing this book, she was just thinking of the novel itself, upset me even more. I'm a writer myself and I always put my fan's before anything because in the end, it is the fans that make the writer famous and help give feedback. I'm disappointed and mad and sad and heartbroken...ugh! Thanks for nothing. There goes ten dollars that I'll never be getting back and a big book that I'll probably be using as fuel to fire up my chimney.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|It's great I started off playing real steel HD and this just went over the standards for the best real steel game there is
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Just when I was getting sick of all the filler (they would have exited it more if Larsson hadn't died, one supposes) it got wickedly good again. Worth reading the whole trilogy, one of the best too-long mysteries I've ever read.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I have enjoyed this trilogy a lot.  I must say there were some shockers (and  several that I'm not happy about) but Allegiant was definitely worth reading.
B000SW4DXK|5.0|Everything about this movie is great! Visually fun, music is great, and everyone will recognize some favorite actors. A must see for the Holidays.
B00EP0KYDO|5.0|I enjoyed the plot.  Different twist from other \\"earth destroyed\\" movies.  I especially liked the relationships between parents and children.  Working out a military career and trying to raise children while alien creatures are intent on killing. Will Smith does an excellent job of working out a relationship as husband, father, and war hero.  Some parenting skills that we could all stand to improve on while fighting to survive....  it's a THUMBS UP for me.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun game, great graphics, and good for kids and adults alike! I have been waiting for this game to come out on the Kindle.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|Great Movie Great Movie Great Movie Great Movie Great Movie Great Movie Great Movie Great Movie Great Movie Great Movie<br />DISAPOINTED a little, the only reason I wanted to see it was to see Mathew M....But he only had a small strip part, the commercials are misleading :(

B00G4NUQYM|5.0|This game is fun,  and not as easy as you would think but just enough difficulty to keep you wondering.
B002MFX0RQ|5.0|This is the greatest production by humans in history, from antiquity to this very day.  Your life will be a squandered hollow empty joke if you do not assimilate this into your very core.  Decades from now, on your death bed, do not let the regret of not buying this DVD plague you.  Make the choice and let your life mean something for the first time.  The choice is yours; Harvey and a full and a meaningful life, or simply exist for as long as your heart continues to beat, by pure inertia.  The choice is yours.

B00GLP47UM|5.0|was at the premiere of Disney's &#34;Beauty and the Beast&#34; in 1992. I remember the feeling that everything in Disney animation was about to change for the better and for a very long time. The combination of story, animation, and above all, song, was the best that had been seen in a film since the 1950's, during the Silver Age of Disney animation. What Alan Menken and Howard Ashman had hinted at in &#34;The Little Mermaid&#34; was given full, beautiful voice in the songs from &#34;Beauty and the Beast,&#34; and I knew that a new Golden Age of Disney animation was on its way.<br /><br />I had that same feeling when I saw &#34;Frozen&#34; a week ago. It is to the new generation of Disney films what &#34;Beast&#34; was to the Disney animated films of the 1990's: a wake up to everything that makes a &#34;Disney&#34; film a truly &#34;Disney&#34; film, and not a Pixar want-to-be. Not a Dreamworks pop-culture retread, but a film by the company that made the animated film a viable and living art form.<br /><br />&#34;Frozen&#34; is simply THAT good of a film. And apart from spectacular animation, a heartfelt and beautiful story, and top-notch voice acting, what makes &#34;Frozen&#34; that good is the music.<br /><br />A perfect combination of song and score, the music by Christophe Beck (instrumental score) and Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez (songs), bring to life the story of sisters Elsa and Anna, princesses of Arandelle. Elsa has the magical power to control and create snow and ice, and as the movie opens, they are best friends who enjoy playing with snow and snowmen in the ballrooms of the palace. When an accident happens that causes things to change, the sisters are torn apart and the story begins.<br /><br />Using traditional Scandinavian instruments, vocal techniques (including &#34;kluning,&#34; a type of shepherds call), and a Norwegian choir (the all-female Cantus, who feature prominently in the opening titles), Beck's score is far more than just incidental music. It's as integral to the story as Alan Menken's instrumental music has been for his Disney animated films.<br /><br />The opening piece, &#34;Vuelie,&#34; is a breathtaking choral piece that sets the tone for the icy, Scandinavian backdrop as Lebo M's famous Swahili chants at the beginning of &#34;The Lion King. Written by Norwegian composer Frode Fjellheim and adapted by Beck, the song combines traditional &#34;Saami yoiking&#34; and a Danish hymn. It evokes a cold and wintry feel while helping set the tonal culture of the film before the segue into a more traditional opening number.<br /><br />That number is &#34;Frozen Heart,&#34; sung by a chorus of ice gatherers. As the men work cutting the ice, the very traditional-sounding song tells the power of the ice, the curse of the ice, and relationship that this culture has with the winter. While it is appreciated for its strength and power, it is recognized as destructive due to the way it freezes everything in its wake. Visually, it's a fun song as the ice cutters work swiftly to load their reindeer-drawn sledge with giant pieces of ice. A young boy, Kristoff, and his pet reindeer, Sven, attempt to help with comic results.<br /><br />The next song, &#34;Do You Want to Build a Snowman?&#34; tells, through poignant lyrics and great performances by the young Anna and, eventually, the grown-up version, what Anna feels as she is shut away from her sister, who unbeknownst to her, has been asked by her parents to hide away her magical gift. As a result, Anna feels like Elsa has shut her out and grows up nearly alone. Once best friends with Elsa, she is now nearly on her own--and by the end of the song, as tragedy strikes, it is clear that she truly is. It's one of those great &#34;showtune&#34; style numbers that helps advance the storyline while also being a great song. It's sung beautifully by the young Anna (voiced by Agatha Lee Monn and Katie Lopez--the songwriters' daughter) and Kristin Bell as the grown-up Anna. By the last refrain, it's definitely a poignant moment.<br /><br />&#34;For the First Time in Forever&#34; is what Howard Ashman called the &#34;I Want&#34; song in the film. At least, it's Anna's. Finally grown up, finally ready for her sister to be crowned queen, her life is about to change. All the loneliness and shuttered away feelings she's had growing up are finally over--the gates of the castle are about to open and she won't be lonely anymore. It's a great &#34;production&#34; number in the film with lots of great movement, character animation, and sweeping visuals. It's a great song. It's a great &#34;Disney&#34; song. It feels &#34;right.&#34; And sung so winningly by Kristin Bell, it turns Anna into an even more engaging and endearing character. Halfway through the song she is joined by Idina Menzel as Elsa, and the former &#34;Wicked&#34; star brings her Elphaba intensity to her character.<br /><br />It's not a surprise that Menzel can sing, and she does, perfectly and beautifully, as Elsa. The real surprise is TV actress Bell, whose vocal performance is as important to the character as Jodie Benson was to Ariel. Without Benson's youthful naivete shining through as Ariel, she might have come across as a far less sympathetic character. Bell is so good as Anna, so warm, so fun, so endearing, and--she is a fantastic singer. To hold her own against a powerhouse like Menzel is something. To make a song like &#34;For the First Time in Forever&#34; feel as classic as &#34;Part of Your World&#34; or &#34;A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes&#34; shows the power of a great song combined with a great performer.<br /><br />The film boasts not one, but two great love songs, and &#34;Love is an Open Door&#34; is a contemporary, pop-sounding duet between Anna and Hans, the prince of a neighboring kingdom. It's a cute and fun number in the film (reminding me a bit of &#34;Kiss the Girl&#34; from &#34;The Little Mermaid&#34;), but it's lyrically quite inventive,melodically interesting. Again, it's sung wonderfully by Bell, whose clear and pure soprano is a great match with Santino Fontana, who sings Hans with great gusto.<br /><br />By this point, the audience is wondering when Menzel, probably the best known performer in the cast, is going to let loose with her big power number. And in that, &#34;Frozen&#34; doesn't disappoint. &#34;Let It Go&#34; is a lock for the Best Original Song Oscar, with it's powerful manifesto of breaking free from constraints and finally being able to be oneself. What is amazing about &#34;Let It Go&#34; is that, while it could come across a bit bitter, in the film, it's an absolutely delightful moment. In this moment, finally allowed to be herself after years of concealing her true self, Elsa lets loose with her power and creates a stunning ice castle. She smiles for the first time since the beginning of the movie, and Menzel's vocal performance is one of joy--yes, the &#34;cold never bothered me anyway,&#34; says Elsa, but it's not out of bitterness, but a realization that finally, for the first time, she can be who she was created to be. In a film full of great songs, this one is obviously a standout.<br /><br />Jonathan Groff, a Broadway actor best known for &#34;Spring Awakening,&#34; delivers a truly memorable performance as Kristoff, the now-grown up ice gatherer whose business has been stymied once Elsa unleashes her power on the kingdom. Although possessed of a beautiful singing voice, Groff only has one song in the film, the silly (and silly-sung) &#34;Reindeer(s) are Better Than People,&#34; which is a cute, throwaway number intended to show the relationship between Kristoff and his best friend, the reindeer Sven. Groff sings for both characters (and speaks for them in several very funny conversations in the film). It's a cute song.<br /><br />The next big production number in the show is sung by Josh Gad (Tony nominee for &#34;The Book of Mormon&#34;). &#34;In Summer&#34; is a paeanto the warmest time of the year--sung with great love and gusto--and a lack of understanding--by snowman Olaf. A great sidekick in the history of Disney's great sidekicks (Dopey, Jiminy Cricket, Timon & Pubmbaa), Olaf is a hilariously naive but funny character, and his big song is full of puns and laughs. It's even funnier onscreen. Gad gives it all he's got with big, belting vibrato, and he makes what is a minor comedic song into a moment when my audience burst into applause.<br /><br />There's a reprise of &#34;For the First Time in Forever,&#34; sung by Bell and Menzel that feels like a number from countless other sung-through shows in that it is mostly dialogue sung by the two sisters as they try to decide what will happen next. It's Anna's efforts to try to get her sister to relate to her--to show that she understands what Elsa is going through. It's a beautiful moment, but it doesn't end well. While it works on the recording, this is one of those songs that really needs to be seen in context to be fully appreciated.<br /><br />One last love song, &#34;Fixer Upper&#34; is sung by some well-meaning trolls to try and get Anna and Kristoff together. Without giving anything away, these trolls feel very protective of Kristoff and really want him to get together with Anna. A song that celebrates that everyone has troubles of their own--each of us is a &#34;fixer upper&#34; and love can really change that--it's a welcome relief in the film when it shows up. It's another more &#34;pop&#34; in sound, but it's quite enjoyable, and the payoff at the end is fantastic. While I wish it wasn't the last song in the film, it's a great number nonetheless. And the trolls, led by Maia Wilson, turn the song into a gospel-lite number that really soars by the end.<br /><br />Over the credits, Demi Lovato's version of &#34;Let It Go&#34; plays. While Lovato does a great job, the song doesn't have half the power of Menzel's version.<br /><br />Like it has since &#34;The Little Mermaid,&#34; Disney once again hasn't put the songs in order of how they appear in the film, meaning you don't get to experience Beck's score interspersed with songs the way you actually would. Which is sad, because many people are going to miss some truly great film music.<br /><br />Beck does a great job mixing melodies introduced in the Lopez' songs into the instrumental cues, but even better, he truly unleashes the spirit of Scandinavian culture in the score. Whether it's traditional instrumentation, vocal ensembles, or even local instruments, al the &#34;folk&#34; elements of the score bring extra life and an underpinning sense of drama and purpose to the story's events. The hymn sung by the choir at Elsa's coronation, &#34;Heimr Arandalr,&#34; translates as &#34;Homeworld Arandelle,&#34; and celebrates the history and culture of the world inside &#34;Frozen.&#34; It's a beautiful piece, beautifully sung.<br /><br />Each instrumental track is unique in its own way, and although I am primarily a fan of the pieces clearly influenced by Scandinavian culture, I am confident that Beck will continue to write and develop exciting music for Disney films. The instrumental pieces I most find perfect in stand-alone ways (unlike an action cue, like the wolf chase) are the adaptations from songs in the film. In this, he doesn't disappoint, giving us several outstanding pieces, including the &#34;Epilogue,&#34; which brings the whole film together, including every song--even &#34;Do You Want to Build a Snowman?&#34;<br /><br />The Deluxe edition includes a second disk of demo versions of the songs and cues in the film, as well as a complete collection of songs cut from the movie as it went through production. The Lopez' introductions to the cut songs help give context and understanding to what went into each song and why it was cut. Standouts of the songs cut from the film (and which will probably show up in the Broadway version someday) include &#34;We Know Better,&#34; a wonderful &#34;sister power&#34; song and &#34;More Than Just the Spare,&#34; which anyone with an older sibling will be able to relate to. Sung very nicely by the composers, the cut songs show the amount of work that goes into an animated film and how big the changes in the story might get.<br /><br />Beck includes many of his demo recordings for the instrumental score and all of them are quite nice--even when the synthesized strings get a little annoying. He includes the score for the original teaser trailer for &#34;Frozen&#34; as well as &#34;source&#34; audio for the folk instruments used in the background during the coronation scene. These are great for purists.<br /><br />Rounding out the physical CD is a track only version of Menzel's &#34;Let It Go.&#34; It's the original orchestral track used in the film, and it's certain there will be preteen girls all over the world practicing for their moment to shine in another Christmas production. Sadly, you only get one of these tracks with the CD, but the instrumental tracks for the other big songs in the show are available for download via iTunes. For all future showtune princesses (and their parents.)<br /><br />As I said in my review for the film (at duanesm.com):<br /><br />&#34;The songs, by husband and wife team Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, are uniformly excellent, and form a cohesive story that moves the film along, adds dimension and life to the characters, and helps the audience understand their hopes, dreams, and motivations. It’s the best collection of songs in one Disney film in the first time for, well, forever, and the composers deserve a multiplicity of awards both now and in the future for creating truly musical songs.&#34;<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

In this, he doesn't disappoint, giving us several outstanding pieces, including the &#34;Epilogue,&#34; which brings the whole film together, including every song--even &#34;Do You Want to Build a Snowman?&#34;<br /><br />The Deluxe edition includes a second disk of demo versions of the songs and cues in the film, as well as a complete collection of songs cut from the movie as it went through production.  The Lopez' introductions to the cut songs help give context and understanding to what went into each song and why it was cut.  Standouts of the songs cut from the film (and which will probably show up in the Broadway version someday) include &#34;We Know Better,&#34; a wonderful &#34;sister power&#34; song and &#34;More Than Just the Spare,&#34; which anyone with an older sibling will be able to relate to.  Sung very nicely by the composers, the cut songs show the amount of work that goes into an animated film and how big the changes in the story might get.<br /><br />Beck includes many of his demo recordings for the instrumental score and all of them are quite nice--even when the synthesized strings get a little annoying.  He includes the score for the original teaser trailer for &#34;Frozen&#34; as well as &#34;source&#34; audio for the folk instruments used in the background during the coronation scene.  These are great for purists.<br /><br />Rounding out the physical CD is a track only version of Menzel's &#34;Let It Go.&#34;  It's the original orchestral track used in the film, and it's certain there will be preteen girls all over the world practicing for their moment to shine in another Christmas production.  Sadly, you only get one of these tracks with the CD, but the instrumental tracks for the other big songs in the show are available for download via iTunes.  For all future showtune princesses (and their parents.)<br /><br />As I said in my review for the film (at duanesm.com):<br /><br />&#34;The songs, by husband and wife team Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, are uniformly excellent, and form a cohesive story that moves the film along, adds dimension and life to the characters, and helps the audience understand their hopes, dreams, and motivations. It’s the best collection of songs in one Disney film in the first time for, well, forever, and the composers deserve a multiplicity of awards both now and in the future for creating truly musical songs.&#34;<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

B00B5HQLMI|2.0|I really had a hard time focus on the storyline ... I think it didn't catch me right in the beginning so I was distracted.
B0002OERI0|5.0|a must have classic album
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I really Love, love the series! Can't wait for the new season in January!! Wow, what a great PBS show
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I like totes loved  this book it's one of my faves. Great author. There are some very sad parts though but I really lived the characters
B00EAIMGDW|3.0|It's a bit slow and sometimes the puzzles are a bit difficult to figure out what the intended objective is.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Great series and it's VERY popular for a reason. If I had just one tiny grip would be that the 1st season played only in English, Season 2 plays in English and Spanish, but season 3 went right back to only playing in English. I just don't understand why these companies can't go an extra mile to add some extra language tracks. In America, most DVDs play in English and French, yet America's dominant languages are English and Spanish. It would just be nice to have the options. Is all.<br /><br />This isn't an issue for most people though. This would be a REALLY good DVD series to have in your collection!
B00GLBIGDA|5.0|This book is one of the best I've read, next to Jane Eyre. High quality writing and twists and turns keep you guessing! Loves it!!
B00FN3HRFA|5.0|I give it 5 STARS, because there is only ONE STAR,......Barbra Streisand! All you need is this wonderful DVD, and the world will be all right.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is an awesome easy to use piece of hardware. I totally recommend it if you want to stream hulu or something ON your TV while being able to play on your computer. It is slower than if you actually connect your computer using an HDMI cord, but I recommend it. Price is great too.
B00AGOGOLE|4.0|Still learning how to use camera.  It look really nice and simple to use.  Having fun with it.  Good going Kindle Fire.
B00F2GIPBI|1.0|As a pro musician, I get a lot of requests for songs. One lady last week asked me for something by `Robbie'. I asked her to be more specific, as I wasn't familiar with him (or her).... She was upset and told me that `everyone knows who Robbie is'. Bear in mind that I live in the US, and this guy is a virtual unknown here. Needless to say, I didn't play a song from someone whose catalog I didn't know.<br />The next day, I decided to give the guy a listen, and so I got myself a copy of this CD. After listening to it for 3 days in my car, I can only be grateful that I didn't waste my money on any other of his CDs.<br />This collection could be called `eclectic' if I want to be kind. I don't. In my opinion this is a mediocre mish-mash of songs, the majority really should have been left off. I'll just give you may take on on a few of the tracks....<br /><br />The opening song is the best track on the collection.'Shine my Shoes' has a nice rhythm and isn't overproduced and there are some great tight brass sounds. I was thinking that I could get into this and I was amused by the `Pig in Shhhh.' reference.<br /><br />The second track, `Go Gentle' starts off with a strumming guitar and really doesn't go anywhere else.<br /><br />Dream a little dream'  features  the talents of Lily Allen. It's pleasant enough, but it adds absolutely nothing to the versions by Ella, Buble or even Cass Elliot.<br /><br />`Swings both ways' begins with the singer giving advice to anyone who is feeling down. Yeah...OK....<br /><br />`I wanna be like you'. This is a song plucked from `The Jungle Book', and it should have stayed there. Olly Murs (an X factor alum) does the Sam Butera part with Williams emulating Louis Prima. He is no Louis Prima. The song is essentially a visual song, and taken out of context it goes nowhere.<br /><br />`Puttin on the Ritz'...What?  As soon as the intro came on, I was reminded of the BEST version of the song, and immediately started thinking of Gene Wilder and Peter Boyle.  A total `throwaway, in my opinion.<br /><br />Technically, `Little Green Apples' is very well done, although I still love the O.C.Smith rendition of the Bobby Russel/Roger Miller classic. Williams is joined by Kelly Clarkson, and she adds another dimension to the song. I was particularly impressed by the arrangement with it's key changes. Acceptable, but nothing you wouldn't find on American Idol<br /><br />Again, when I heard the `Minnie The Moocher' rendition, I  was immediately reminded of `The Blues Brother'. This version again, taken out of context and nothing positive is added.<br /><br />The Soda Pop song with Buble is a waste of Michaels's talent. There really isn't a discernible melody.<br /><br />I could go one, but it would be cruel...on my fingers, except to say that this was my first experience with this vocalist, and obviously my last. If I wish to buy CDs from British vocalists who are virtually unknnwo in the US, I'll stick with Sir Cliff<br /><br />The CD is now in the Goodwill store in Riviera Beach Florida if anyone would like to buy a coaster.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love that it's available on Kindle now. Great game and fun to pass the time. My 2 things I'd like to see is less time waiting for more lives or just having more lives to start with and not having to buy them. Also make it easier to get to each level/getting tickets.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is fun. But I wish they would give more tokens, I am out. But overall the game is fun and great for kids.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Really good story. Was so fun to reread the shining, then go directly to this. Loved this book. Great ending.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|It is just the right amount of hard. It also has little mini games that are fun and entertaining. Addicting.
B00B8R1NP0|1.0|the plot was excellent, but the writing was atrocious.  Written in the third person, present tense, with some of the most unrealistic dialog I have ever read in a novel.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love all the different configurations on each level. Some of the levels are soooo hard but fun. I like to try and beat a friends scores.
0374533571|2.0|Great movie adaptation--kudos to the screenwriter.<br /><br />I actually did the read the book first, after I saw a trailer for the film. I wanted to become familiar with the book before seeing the movie.<br /><br />Not a good novel. Bad writing, poor character development. Sometimes films are improvements on mediocre books!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Ms. Goodwin is in a class of her own among historical writers. She reveals the real life issues of Lincoln as well as his opposing rivals in a deeply personal and honest struggle for each of  them at that most crutial time for our country. She describes the disturbing times of that day in a very clear and concise manner making the ultimate efforts and success of Lincoln truely miraculous.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I was riveted by The Kite Runner, and A Thousand Splendid Suns is one of my favorite novels. I got the sense that Hosseini was experimenting with And The Mountains Echoed, but it didn't work well for me.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Enjoyed the game. I feel more coins should be awarded after completion of a challenge. But I am aware programmers need a paycheck too, good work guys.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book,  it kept me interested and wanting more until the ending.<br /><br />The good:  The battle scenes played out vividly in my head, as did most of the other interactions between Ender and the other students.  The pace of the book was good.  It felt like at parts it was a sprint while other parts slowed down a little bit, but not in a bad way.<br /><br />The bad:  It got a little weird towards the end.  It was a little out there for me, and it made me go from wanting to immediately purchase the sequel to abandoning the series.
B00DXP7L88|3.0|This and Six Feet Under are two of my favorite series of all time.  I bought this season as soon as it became available and started it with great anticipation.  This season has a lot of twists and turns that are new for Dexter (his estrangement from his sister, etc.) and the character evolves more than in any other season.  That being said, and without ruining it for those who haven't seen it yet, the final episode FLOPS.  Like several other reviewers, I was extremely underwhelmed by the ending.  On a positive note, there are a lot of special features.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|The first two books were so good and I was so looking forward to reading the last book. I even held out reading it because I did not want the story to end. I just can't believe the ending! Hated it!!! So disappointed. I just want to scream! Definitely will not be watching the movies!!!!
B00CM4VC7M|5.0|My daughter was very pleased. Recommended to all fans. Well made, and high quality. Bound to be a nice collectors item worth much in the future.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|This review first appeared on Books i View.<br /><br />Eleanor & Park by Rainbow Rowell was sitting on my to read list for a while now. I typically don’t get excited about contemporaries so they often get overshadowed by other genres for me. But once I heard that this book was banned in an entire county I picked it up right away. I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. The synopsis seems pretty innocent. What was in this book that could cause it to be banned? I was on a mission to find out for myself.<br /><br />Eleanor & Park is set in 1986 and follows the budding relationship of two sixteen year-olds as they fall in love for the first time. It starts off simple with Eleanor as the new girl on the bus. Being a little over weight with bright red hair and outrageous clothes she doesn’t fit in with the other kids. Park is an Asian American boy who does something completely unexpected and sweet by offering a seat for Eleanor on the bus when no one else would. As the school year progresses so does their friendship and pretty soon romance begins to blossom. We also learn more about Eleanor’s life, how her family is stuffed into a tiny house, scraping by with little money and with a step father who hates her. This is a story about love, hope, friendship, courage, bravery and the unexpected places you will find it.<br /><br />I don’t have too many favorite books that are contemporary but Eleanor & Park will now be added to that list. I adore this book to pieces! In a way I’m a little glad it was banned because if it wasn’t I probably still wouldn’t have read it. This book is about everything first love should be. It should give you butterflies, leave you breathless and most importantly leave a lasting impression. That’s exactly what this book did to me.<br /><br />Before I read this book I had heard the hand holding in this book was pretty intense…. turned out it was and then some. Even Park was surprised at how intense a simple hand hold could be.<br /><br />“Jesus. Was it possible to rape somebody’s hand”<br /><br />I have to really applaud Rainbow Rowell for making the simplest things like holding hands, a phone call, comic books, mixed tapes and the first kiss so intense, so romantic, so sweet. Every little step forward they took in their relationship is important, meaningful and will give you thrill like jumping off a cliff. I loved the fact that Eleanor & Park thought everything through first and took the time to explore their new feelings before acting. They were not foolish about it either instead they were very smart and patient. I think Eleanor & Park would be a perfect example of a healthy and loving relationship for teens.<br /><br />Another thing I think I should mention is that this book is told in alternating points of view. I loved that it was told in duel point of view. We get both sides of the story and get to read how and when both of them fell in love with the other.<br /><br />Now why in the world was it banned?? When I heard this book was banned the first thing I did was a little research as to why. I came across a letter written by the parents of a kid who received a copy of this book for her summer reading list. You can read more about why Eleanor & Park was banned here. The letter contains a list of words and phrases that appear in the book along with the page number they appear on. After I read the list I picked up the book and started to read. When I finished I was shocked. Is this really the same book that the list was referring too? The main characters hardly ever used that kind of language nor acted inappropriate for their ages. All I’m going to say is look at the context in which the language/phrases are used. You can’t just count all the bad words and determine if it’s appropriate or not.<br /><br />I don’t support book banning. Some kids need books like this. Books like this is what can spark someone’s love for literature. Books like this is what some kids are currently going through. I wish I had this book when I was younger, I would have fallen in love with reading sooner. If you want to censor what your kid reads that’s up to you, just please don’t take it away from other kids as well.<br /><br />Okay my little book banning rant is over. I loved this book so much. I wish I could read it for the first time all over again. I can’t. But I do foresee me rereading this in my future many times over again! I would definitely recommend this if you want something super sweet to read or if you like to read contemporaries. You’ll love this!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The updates add excitement to the game.  It gets going so fast at times that it's certain to challenge everyone.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is very addictive and fun to play. There is some strategy involved.  Good game for young and older players.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|What an amazing book of the power of an animal and the love and strength it can bring to someone's life.  I have recommended this book to everyone I know!
B005COO1X6|5.0|Mr. Stephen king is as good as ever. His prose is superb in this book. Just seat back and enjoy it.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I loved it. Every moment- truly plunging me into an exciting world.<br />I'll be sure to recommend this series to anyone loving a good read
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I was not very happy with this book. I loved the first two, but thought this book's plot/level of entertainment was not up to par with the others. Not to mention the terrible ending.
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|This game was to my surprise a lot better than I expected it to be the graphics were not bad at all, The look of the cars were pretty well constructed in a graphical point of view
B008JFUPK8|3.0|*this review is for the Blu ray dvd digital copy only*<br />Hello all<br />I have never been a true fan of superman i have warm memories of the cartoon that came on in the 90's and some exposure to him in the justice league and young justice tv shows but beyond that i have very limited knowledge of superman, but being a comic fan you know a little more than a non comic fan. With that said let me say that i am very pleased with this movie in this movie you could really tell that zack snyder and the rest of the crew really tried to do justice to the superman mythos and cared how things were done. While this is a good attempt and a very well done movie it is no avengers and it is not a great movie.<br /><br />First off what i like<br /><br />  the story is well done, all the characters from Johnathan, to martha, to clark, and lois are done and the modern spin on the daily planet is a good shot in the arm the series needed after the fall of superman returns.<br />  the effects are great they really tried to give you the feel of superman flying fighting and all the super heroics he does.<br />  general zod is a truly evil villain, from the beginning to the end he is single minded in his belief of what he does and his army follows blindly behind him.<br /><br />  for dc fans there are a couple of easter eggs you will notice if you look like certain names and what not but beyond that nothing for the dc fans out there.<br />  The special features are good the examination of krypton is really good as well as the other features and the 75th anniversary short is also very welcome for the fans.<br />  they also made him more relate able in the movie which is a major plus<br /><br />Now for what i did not like<br /><br />  first off zack could have done more to connect this to the larger dc universe now i dont know if this was a decision he made or one made for him but i believe it was a mistake.<br />  if there ever was a movie that deserved a post credits scene it was superman, this i believe was a major mistake, they could have linked it to the Dark knight saga or they could have set the ground for the now announced superman batman movie they did neither and i think this was an opportunity wasted.<br />  Marvel movies are known for the little shout outs to the larger marvel universe, little names, events or even characters not known to the non comic fans but little things that are known to the fans this could have been done so many times and while there is one or two there could have been more.<br />  the movie takes a little bit to get started, and while i believe there was no way around this many movies have this problem they still make the first part enjoyable, in this case it is good but the back half of the movie is so much better.<br />  some of the changes that have been made to the character many true fans may not like.<br /><br />This is a good movie and i truly believe that zack snyder and his crew were and did do justice to the character there was so much more that could have been done, this is a good movie with lots of missed opportunities that could have been better.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|Was very intrigued when I started playing this game.  It is a well made upgrade from the Oregon Trail game many of us played as kids.  Once all your initial resources are gone then the in game purchasing kicks in and makes it near impossible to play without forking it over.  All in all it is a more entertaining way to waste your money than dumping it into a deep chasm.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I am a fan of reading the books before seeing movies, and this one stays pretty close to the book.  Enjoyed it very much!
B004JN1D2I|2.0|After all the hype on this series (both books and show) I purchased it.  I'm not a fan of all the graphic sexuality in the show so I figured this would be a way to ride the Game of Thrones wave.  A short while into the first book I found out why the show is the way it is.  He writes with a descriptive style that I can only define as perverse.  Unfortunately I can not bring myself to fill my time with entertainment that equates to pornographic Lord of the Rings.  Fortunately there are plenty of other great books out there in this genre.
B000001EC1|5.0|I originally bought the Casette back in the day (late 90's early 2000)- then cassette players went the way of the eight track player so  now  I had to purchase the CD!  It's a great addition to any BonJovi fan's collection and  especially &#34;greatest hits&#34; collection.  This has all the hits up until that time and has a great accoustic version of &#34;Living on a Prayer  '92&#34; which is equally inspiring as the original amped version... What I also love is the cover photo..  Alec Jon Such is in this photo which is great because he was part of BonJovi when these songs were created and recorded and have become iconic songs of the 80's rock history and for all time.  It also shows that Jon does not forget his beginnings and those who were there to help make the band's success what it has become through the years and what it is today.<br />When I think of BonJovi I always think of these 5 brothers rocking the world together.
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|This game is creepy... redundant and creepy!  The movement is easy and fluid and the game is fairly straight forward, but did I mention it is creepy?
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Just when you thought it was over...there was more.<br />Kept you on the edge of your seat. Surprises all over!
B003L77GGA|5.0|Can't say enough about this series!  Loved it!  My families favorite series.  From my husband to our 15 year old daughter they all love it.  My daughter even has her friends watching it now.  It was fun to see how Superman got started although this series goes way out on a limb with the side characters and their 'abilities' (but then again we are talking about superman).
B00F880BWG|5.0|this show is addicting. the cast is great and the situations realistic. I often wonder what I would do given their situation.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Castle is always a good mix of drama and fun.  Good writing keeps us guessing.  The stars are all wonderful and likeable too.  I haven't been hooked on a show like this in years!
B00ENXBUR2|3.0|Im only rating it Okey because the clear acrylic stand that is supplied with it is so flimsy that when i inserted into the slot for the first time it cracked. Fortunatly it still stands up, but was quite disapointed after opening the box and seeing how nice the tin was. So beware, be very careful with the stand its is easly broken.
0316174483|3.0|There is nothing wrong with this book.  I made the mistake of purchasing this book to learn to draw/paint.  This book is really for children.  It's unique and whimsical.  It's just not (only my opinion) for adults.
B005TVYVI2|1.0|I thought this would be a great way to get the best out of my morning swims.<br />Unfortunately, when it arrived the unit didn't work, wouldn't turn on. Against my better judgement, I bought a new battery (that I'll never use :/) but still no joy. Cheap, flimsy junk.<br />I wish I'd read the negative reviews, it seems my experience is not uncommon. Save your money!
0060853972|4.0|A sharp and witty outlook of the impossible, the great minds of Gaiman and Pratchett together sure make one hell of a team.
B008V8FVTI|5.0|Very disturbing but outstanding film that brings forth a situation that unfortunately may be true.  The kid actors are fantastic.
B00DYEN5QU|5.0|Great movie and we bought the 3D video. It was ok but, the 3D graphics were not all that numerous.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This is my kill time game n it never let me down I could be at WK nothing to do n I pull out my tablet n play
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I really like Castleville Legends better than Castleville.It is easy to use you don't need WiFi to use it and you don't need neighbors to do quests. My friends stopped playing Castleville and then I had trouble finishing the quests. The items are expensive and it takes me awhile to build up my coins and crowns but it is not impossible. You have the option to buy crowns with real money if you want to. I will be playing Castleville Legends for a long time without losing interest. I wish they would turn Farmville, Hidden Chronicles, and Pioneer Trails into Kindle Fire games just like Castleville Legends.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Not your typical match three in a row game. I'm having alot of fun. It's free, but I would pay for this game.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Excellent movie. This is one your grand kids will enjoy over and over. I was pleasantly surprised that I did too! The bonus features on producing the movie are very interesting also.
0143038583|4.0|Read this for my AP English Language and Composition class. It was a great book that helped raise awareness of what we are eating!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|game is really fun and can keep my attention with its increasingly difficult puzzles. good way to pass the time
B009VIZDLI|4.0|I enjoyed the Rosie project.<br />The protagonist in this story was very dry and I found him very humorous.<br />I could definitely recommend this Title to those of you with a dry sense of humour.
B003E8P9G0|4.0|My 10 year old daughter and I listened to this on a road trip. She loved it. I think the formula is wearing out for me, but any book that keeps my kids reading and wanting to learn more about the topic (we have awitxh from Greek to Egypt now) is a winner in my book.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|This game is amazing I saw it for the apple devices But not<br />Kindle which made me mad and oh yea am I the only one with no multiplayer?
B003B02O0A|4.0|I listened to a recent radio interview of John Grisham.  He was so delightful in the interview I decided that I had to read his books. I like to start at the beginning, some sort of a compulsion I guess, plus he had spoken of this book in the interview -- the interview was related to his newest book Sycamore Row, which is a sequel of sorts to this book.  I was not disappointed.  He is a masterful story teller and his characters are real people that the average reader can relate to.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|It always amazes me that Nicholas Sparks writes such great love stories, with a little mystery in the mix. Well worth reading.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|This app is fun, but is also helping me to learn French again! It helps to keep me interested while I try to keep doing better. I'm excited to start the other languages...
B00CNQ7CRI|2.0|Sad that Mark died and Bridget has not learned to manage life on her own. Would have been a better book without the same old stuff.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|These guys are just sooooooo talented!  Anyone who appreciates good music and likes a little pizzazz added to the classics will love The Piano Guys.  Watch their videos on You Tube and you'll see!
B0052OSTOS|5.0|Not much for the voice instructions, which can be pretty much eliminated, but the music is quite soothing and seems to lower my heart rate to be in sync.
B002KJX4IE|5.0|Always just a fun wacky movie to watch!  The concept is great and many wonderful performances al the way down to the dog.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I enjoy playing this game and want to keep playing to pass the levels.  I like that I can play it on my phone or kindle or computer.
0099421348|5.0|This book is such a classic love story.  The book follows so closely to the movie. A must for those who have ever fallen in love ~
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It's a real facebook app for your fire - from facebook inc, so it will not have the normal &#34;API has been deprecated&#34; problem that third party facebook apps typically have.  I like that you can jump back up to the top when there are new articles without scrolling (the old browser hosted way at mobile.facebook.com).
B002G1YPH0|4.0|Lowered the load temp of my Core i5 2400 by 25 degrees Celsius vs the stock cooler and the fan is much quieter than the stock fan. A bit of a pain to install as the motherboard has to be removed if your case doesn't have a cut out in the motherboard tray. My case has a huge fan on top and I wanted to mount the heatsink so the fan was blowing the air towards the top but this heatsink is so large that it hit my ram so I had to rotate it 90 degrees and have it blow out of the back of the case and I had to mount the fan in a pull direction instead of a push direction, it still works well in this configuration as revealed by the massive temperature drop. I also had to remove the side panel fan bracket from my case as this this heatsink is very tall. I doubt you'll find anything better in this price range.<br /><br />Pros: Excellent price/performance ratio   huge drop in load temp   quieter than stock<br /><br />Cons: Huge- might interfere with ram, video cards, mosfet coolers, case side panel   not silent   pain to install if motherboard tray doesn't have a cut out<br /><br />Note: I used Gelid Solutions GC-Extreme Thermal Compound TC-GC-03-A on this heatsink, I did not compare it to the included paste but I imagine the difference would be at most only a couple of degrees.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Really interesting zombie virus tale, well done in the drama and action departments.  Pitt plays a caring father who is a UN contractor/specialist, and has to go around the world to find the facts about the infections and then to find a cure.  All before his family gets eaten.  Really good pitt flick.
B0048LPRCS|3.0|you really have to have a big tolerance for a wild ride. of course I am a child of the 60's that may have something to do with my opinion.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|The game is interesting, however it's not easy to get items to move up to different levels. Your tempted to spend real money just so you can advance quicker.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Hands down best overall language app. Turns language acquisition into a game and keeps you challenged. I still supplement with audio books and other apps, but find myself turning to Methodist often as I learn quickly and it's interesting.
B00AKO93JK|5.0|Best workout app I have ever ran across.  The videos are great and will real people.  Highly recommend this for everyone.
B00BATG18K|4.0|At first I wasn't sure if I liked it.  But as I read more I really enjoyed this book. So I recommend it
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|I need to reread parts to fully understand what he has found in his experiences to create the man he has become.<br />As a boy left to his own devices and needing to translate his discoveries into becoming a man he has shown extreme intelligence.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This review is for the replacement cable that amazon customer service sent to me free of charge.  My initial cable only lasted about 1 year before the cord frayed and the internal wiring was exposed.  The customer service agent was very helpful and agreed to send me a replacement via 1-day shipping.  I really did appreciate the fact that I didn't have to argue and the process was so simple.
B00DJ735KI|5.0|This book opens the discussion for considering our biology beyond Darwinism and has plenty of scientific evidence to suggest our cells are affected by our environment as well.
B00BFBSV72|2.0|All I get is a black background screen on my kindle fire HDX.  All I can see when I play is sonic, the characters, and some platforms.  There's nothing worse than paying for a product that does not work properly.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Abyss The Wraiths of Eden One of the better HOG games...as always I never want the story to end. Look forward to a sequel?!
B003INBNXO|5.0|A must have for any practitioner. Lineages may differ, spellings may differ, but Wing Chun is Wing Chun.<br /><br />Watch it minimally 3 times a year and never gets old.
B005I4JG80|3.0|Sometimes this book was a little hard to get into.  I enjoyed comparing French and American ways of parenting and agree a lot with French ideas.  Since this is written with one woman's view point and she used supporting documents to support her argument, I feel that the information is a little leaning towards French parenting, when in fact American mothers are just as great at parenting as the French.
B00ED2EMJQ|5.0|I was tremendously impressed with this album. I'd had the original vinyl in the 70s and had the live I'm Going Home and Good Morning Little Schoolgirl on a best of cd, but the entirety of this double cd blew me away. These were the best bonus cuts I've heard added on to an album. The Frankfurt and Paris shows were both incredible and the Rotterdam and Amsterdam filler was just as good. Hearing One of These Days again was thrilling and the jams out of I Can't Keep From Crying Sometime and Slow Blues in C were amazing. I'd forgotten that Ten Years After was one of the top live bands in the world at one time. Not anymore!
B0060QM0AG|5.0|Loved this book, chose it because I was told it was about our veterinarians great grandfather, or uncle, from back home.  Let my mother in law borrow it and she enjoyed it so much that she bought the whole set.  For animal lovers of all kinds, this book is funny, emotional, and just a great read.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I could not put this book down. There were certain parts I had to remind myself that the Germans were our enemy during World War II. It really gave me a different perspective of the Germans, and what they went through. Also  how one act of kindness to the enemy can impact several peoples lives. I would highly recommend this book to others to read.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Some parts of this book were a little slow, and I felt it pretty predictable but there were still some moments when I was questioning my own conclusions.
B00BB3UYS8|4.0|A really good beginning to the series.  The only neg I have is that the author could have been a bit more gritty.  I think it's just for a younger audience, which is ok since I believe he has children.  Although it's a bit too &#34;PG&#34; for me he still kept me interested throughout the story.  The symbolism is amazing as is the esoteric concepts he provides.  Hopefully the second book will be a bit more realistic, however it rivals books like Harry Potter to me in this genre.
B0011AQLZQ|5.0|The second movie in the series. We have the complete series and usually watch them in marathon from beginning to end!
B0006HC0I2|5.0|A Classic of cinema. It is in french, but everyone understands it because it is universal.  It is a perfect gangster movie that shows reality of life.  Just great.
B005529EI2|5.0|This is so worth getting its has way more in it!! I really liked this better than the original! I wish I would have gotten this first!
B001GF7WRW|2.0|These are the worst headphones I've ever tried, much less owned.  I deeply regret purchasing them.<br /><br />The sound quality is decent enough for the money, but they are of very poor construction.<br /><br />They are made of the cheapest plastic; the self-adjusting headband is self-adjusting because of a cheap elastic material (that I don't expect to last); and the padding around the ear breathes not at all, leaving me sweating after mere minutes.<br /><br />They aren't small enough to be portable and they aren't sturdy enough to justify their large size.<br /><br />The fact that they sound decent and not horrible is the only reason I gave them two stars instead of one.  (But &#34;decent&#34; is the nicest thing I can say about the way they sound.)
B00CWVGS10|4.0|This was a pretty good movie. I really think people should take the time to watch a movie before they put an opinion on it. I thought it was good.
B003L77GGK|5.0|One of my favorite TV shows. Me and the miss get the seasons every year!We don't get to watch tv a lot sucks we have to wait to watch but it is absolutely worth it.You really can't just watch one episode and not want to watch the entire season.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It is an excellent means for communication between the devices and the tv in order to watch from different apps. It is fast, reliable, easy and effective technology. I recommend it highly.
B0036JU6CY|5.0|For martial arts movie fans this movie brings about all the action desired.  It is nonstop brutal action.  It is also quite unbelievable in the power external and internal of some of the martial arts involved, but that is what makes it so spectacular.  Don't think real, think fantasy.  If you let your mind open, then you will truly enjoy the experience.
B00005RDSM|5.0|They got it to me expediently and it is in great condition. Makes gift giving more affordable which we appreciate.
0684857219|5.0|One of the best books on the subject written.  Includes history of bodybuliding, nutirtion, workout plans, variations, and competition tips.
B0031R5K72|5.0|Heartbreaking but uplifting, this book will change your life. An amazing story with the best cast of characters and a narrative that is truly unique. I laughed and I cried, and I never wanted it to end
0553805371|5.0|Glossy paper and in color.  Not as good as a brief history of time or a nutshell (a little more complex) but an excellent read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The only way to put it down is to run out of lives. If you have enough friends that send you lives, you have to wait until your battery dies.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Daniel Craig makes the best 007!  Looking forward to the next movie, we are all fans in my family.  Great for Movie Night at home or on the big screen.
B001RTP3YQ|3.0|I like his voice, but the CD has backup singers and they start to get on my nerves after a while, too much repeating by  them.  I heard this CD at a friend's house, but I must have not noticed the annoyance before.  Otherwise it's good.
B00FXES5WS|5.0|She is an incredible! I never buy Christmas CD, but because of the touch of her voice and song, well! I and ending buy a Christmas album. I saw the movie Wao! it make me cry very deep of hope. She make me realy pray back to God. My favor song Miracle hymn.. Your are special Susan and more of all for your age you touch my heart and make me strong! love you Susan B.  You touch many countries. Hope you see this massage from me, Jessica Ponder from Panama Country.
B004LROMSY|5.0|I absolutely loved this series and wish it continued past the first season.  Eva Green was amazing as Morgan!  My very favorite Morgan of any King Arthur movie.  Perfectly evil, yet so captivating.  I believe Jamie Campbell Brown was a great Arthur, too.  He is young, yes, but Arthur was supposed to be young and inexperienced, so that we could see how he grows into his position.  I think he did an excellent job!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|It took a couple chapters for me to get used to the vantage point the book is written from but in the end I enjoyed it. The story is written well enough that you feel the experiences Liesel goes through. Highly recommended and wish there was more to it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Fun and addictive! I lost my original data a little over a year ago and uninstalled but I decided to give it another try.I couldn't be happier!
B0026IQYEA|4.0|LOVE this story of a young Queen Elizabeth's rise to power.  Wish there were more information available in the film about the degree to which her affair actually happened.  Little too risque to show in my AP European History class, but I offer it as an extra credit assignment. History aside, a very enjoyable film
B00ESY77LO|2.0|Extremely disappointing. Sorry we wasted our money. The story didn't make any sensible sense. The only good thing was seeing those two gorgeous cars. Otherwise, a thoroughly disgusting plot.
B00DGMVJAO|1.0|Terrible playback experiences - stopped and started constantly. Husband enjoyed the movie anyway, but it just makes it frustrating to watch.
B001E45XT4|5.0|I bought these for my husband so he wouldn't keep me up at night when he games, and he must love them because I don't even have to ask him to use them!<br /><br />I've borrowed them a few times and find them to be extremely comfortable, and if I'm on my laptop, and he's gaming in the living room (volume at full blast, naturally) they totally tune out his noisy games and I can enjoy what I'm watching!
B004SEUJ82|5.0|Incredible story of this young boy taking the place of his friend in the consentration camp. Very, very tear jerking.
B00DQZT38G|5.0|Shew! Finally!  I ordered this cover for my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 October 20th and it just arrived today (Nov.25,2013)  Amazon had originally said it would be released on Nov.12th but for some reason it wasn't released on time.  Anyway, I really like the cover.  It's very smart looking and lightweight.  It's perfectly designed for all the buttons and cameras and charger port. I love the way it adjusts for different viewing angles in Landscape, which is what I use to watch videos and read.  It's not really designed to be a vertical stand but for my use it is perfect.  I've always found Belkin products to be good quality and this one is no exception.
B000K7VHQE|3.0|This definitely got a lot of attention by movie goers as well as the accolades if it's peers.  However, I found it to be mediocre.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I'm late on catching on to this series, but better late than never because this book was AMAZING! Hope's story would've destroyed any other person, yet (thanks to Dean Holder and also Karen) she became a survivor of her circumstances. The love that little boy had for Hope and continued to have for her once he found her again is incredible and breathtaking. This is a definite must read book and I can't wait to read Dean's POV because I just know it will be amazing just like him!
B00ERIUO02|5.0|Absolutely love that song Roar! Katy Perry ROCKS! I'd suggest this album to any Katy Perry fan. Hear Her ROAR!
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Always love Denzel, didn't like him so much in this, at first!  He did such a fabulous job of telling a story in this!
B00GH4RKYM|1.0|Don't expect a the dark-knight kind of movie. Sadly enough, This is more like transformers. You may feel nostalgia of the Christopher Reeve's movies after watching this. Boring.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|If you like music, and you are interested in how it is made, buy this movie. You won't regret it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it. I play it at school with friends in the mornings in the gym. Can't wait for the new update (which is 0.8.0)
B00G32OMF8|2.0|Story line terrible. Acting not good especially Julie Delpy. I agree with others almost looks like they wanted the film to fail.  The first movie great, second not so, the third they shouldn't have bothered. I gave it two stars for Ethan Hawke's effort and the scenery looked lovely.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|luved it soooo much it was awesome<br /><br />ive been waiting to get this kindle so i get this app awsome!!!!
1449320104|4.0|Extremely informative, haven't even finished it yet.  But that's my problem.  The book is over 1000 pages, I wouldn't consider that &#34;in a nutshell&#34;.
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|This is the best frontline war game yet for Kindle.great graphics and easy to controll and navigate through the game.

B003H6KRIE|4.0|love the movies but blue ray quality of this dvds not up to scratch...low resolution unlike most blu ray dvd ...
B0047Y17P2|5.0|This is my favorite Lincoln Lawyer novel yet! It grabbed me and didn't let go till the very end. I'm supposed to leave on a trip tomorrow, and planned to spend today preparing to go. The only problem is that I just couldn't put this book down. Got to cut this review short because it's almost dark and I have sooooo much to do . . .
B007HACDLK|5.0|What is not to like about Vince Flynn's books. We all know Mitch Rapp will save the day, but how he gets there is the fun part. Well written, with the plot moving forward at a brisk pace.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|An absolutely amazing end to the story of Katniss and The Hunger Games. You will not be disappointed. Wow! In love with these books and characters.

0786838655|4.0|Do you like action adventure books? If you do Percy Jackson The Lightning Thief is the book for you. Percy Jackson is a series written by Rick Riordan.

0061146307|5.0|In a series of unfortunate events sunny, Claus and violet are intelligent, being intelligent is positive and a great thing, I think it’s good so you can have lots of adventure in your life, and they have lots in the book.

If you like adventure this book is for you. Count Olaf is a man who only adopted sunny, clause and violet because he wants there fortune. Count Olaf killed their parents, to be selfish. This might sound odd but that’s a good and positive thing do they can learn from what happened, there really smart so they can get through it all. Count Olaf makes the kids do chores, but they always find a way to escape him. Love humor, adventure and a bit odd scare, you’re looking at the perfect book.
014242613X|5.0|Theodore the Accused Boone makes you want to keep reading. First off, it is full of mysteries that involve the police and you don’t know who will be going to jail. Also, it keeps you on the edge of your seat by trying to figure out who did the crime. Finally, it is action packed with vandalism, fights at Theodore’s school, and rocks thrown through windows! I hope you enjoy reading this book as much as I did.
0316201545|5.0|The Land of Stories the Enchantress Returns<br />The Land Of Stories the Enchantress Returns is a hilarious book that is hard to put down. For example in this story most of the chapters leave off on cliffhangers. Also this story shows you two points of view of both of the main characters. Finally, this book includes jokes and makes the character’s thoughts funny. If you like hilarious and suspenseful books then I am 100% positive that you will like The Land Of Stories the Enchantress Returns as much as I did.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King were the three Disney movies that had the most impact in the 90s for me.<br /><br />It felt like watching a broadway show in animated form! I found myself caring for these pixels so much it was strange. A lot is due to the wonderful voice acting.<br /><br />I'm so happy my children will get to experience these movies in beautiful hi-def.<br /><br />Technology is awesome!
