B00006I53S|4.0|I have been using this lens for a year already and I must say I truly enjoy it.  I use a Canon 60D which is a 1.6x crop camera.  Here's the pros and cons.    Pros:  - Great walk around lens, good focal length  - Balances camera well  - Nice Grip  - IS helps so much at stills and video  - USM allows lens to be very quiet  - Manual focus is steady, nice.    Cons:   - May be a little heavy to people but I like it  - Zooming in and out isn't so smooth. Not that it's rough, but it seems to loose.  - On a 1.6 crop camera, you will wish it was wider.    Things to watch out for:  - Your lens well zoom in when on your neck, and it will just drop down to 135mm because of the weight.    It's a good buy, along with the 50mm f/1.4 It's 2 great lenses to hold.    Most of my shots are with this lens, check some photos here.  [...]
B00002SWEM|5.0|Lo que me interesaba era escuchar la música de Buena Vista Social Club; sin embargo, me encontré con la agradable sorpresa de un muy buen documental, además de la música.   Es un CD para conservar como documento histórico y de colección, que recomiendo a los amantes de la música cubana.  El precio fue bastante cómodo para mi. El material llegó a tiempo y en buen estado.

B000002H70|5.0|20 years ago this week I became a fan of The Cure.  I was 14 years old and had just moved to a new school so I knew absolutely no one.  After a week or two or three or whatever of hazing from the upper-classmen, I found that the one place the jocks and the Future Farmers of America did not go was the art room.  All of a sudden I took a deep and abiding interest in Cubism and Postmodern architecture and found exactly 42 minutes of refuge right before lunch.  There I met a kid named Chris.  Chris probably went to your school too: Jim Morrison hair, John Lennon glasses and a \\"Meat is Murder\\" t-shirt.  In retrospect,  Chris was a jerk; but he had excellent taste in music.  A year earlier Faith No More had made it OK to listen to \\"College rock\\" or the \\"Underground\\" or whatever we called Alternative music before there was such a thing.  I had my fill of Motley Jovi and wanted something with a little more depth to it. What I got would forever alter the way that I listen to music.<br /><br />It was on a surprisingly cool September morning when the art class went on a field trip (a whole day with no jocks, score!).  Chris, as usual, ignored the world and hid in the back of the bus with his Sony Walkman.  For whatever reason, when I asked him what he was listening to he took some measure of pity on a lowly Freshman and handed me the headphones.  I don't remember the song.  I remember staring out of the window, watching trees and cars blur by as the singer wailed over distorted guitars, pounding drums and layers of synthesizers.  Some time went by, who knows how long, but Chris came to his senses and realized that this dork did not have ears qualified to listen to his Walkman. He held out his hand and I reluctantly turned over the headphones.  Without asking, Chris spoke the last two words that he said to me all day: The Cure.<br /><br />Somewhere along the line I purchased Disintegration second-hand at a record store.  Even at the tender age of too young to drive I recognized that I was listening to something extraordinary.  From the way \\"Plainsong\\" doesn't really start so much as announce its presence, to the way \\"Untitled\\" dies off and attempts to carry you with it into Oblivion, Disintegration was the first record I heard that mattered.  Every bit of it seemed profound and difficult and undeniably essential.  As Gallup's opening bass riff to Fascination Street blares in the background while I type this, the album still evokes those same emotions and responses.  There's no greater testament to a record's strength than to see how it stands the test of time.  This is undeniably Robert Smith's piece de resistance (thanks art class!), but the argument could be made that Disintegration was the musical high water mark for a generation.  You can list any number of great albums from this era with ease, but Disintegration is art, plain and simple.<br /><br />The album manages to be sonically vast in its scope, while at the same time coming off deeply personal and reflective.  There is a dichotomy between the dark symphony that the layers of synths and rhythmic drumming create and Smith's loathing, mournful and deeply personal lyrics.  While \\"Love Song\\" was written as a wedding gift for his wife, Robert sings of a torturous relationship in \\"Prayers for Rain\\" and, as the final notes play backwards, you get the sense that rain is ascending, not falling.  One more unanswered prayer, I suppose.  This gives way to \\"The Same Deep Water as You\\" and a deluge of longing and synths and rain mix together for the next nine minutes or so of your life.  Is there a more visually evocative album than this?<br /><br />20 years, a career, a wife and two children later, I'm grateful that this album still resonates with me.  Our parents, musical elitists that they were, turned their noses up to punk, post-punk, hardcore and synth-pop; dismissing my generation's music as \\"soulless\\".  Disintegration stands in direct opposition to this line of thinking; granting those who care to explore it a dark, sometimes whimsical, but ultimately beautiful journey that has never seen its equal.<br /><br />I have to doubt that it ever will.e who care to explore it a dark, sometimes whimsical, but ultimately beautiful journey that has never seen its equal.<br /><br />I have to doubt that it ever will.
B003UBTX7C|5.0|Like many Baldacci readers, I have yet to tire of the Camel Club.  While this is more of a story about Oliver Stone...still enjoyed it.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I had been in a reading funk. Started many books, did not finish any. Then I listened to the podcast of  Nancy Pearl interviewing Deborah Harkness on Booklust. The interview really tweaked my interest. Once I started the book I could not stop reading. It is about a young woman, who is a witch, but does not want to be a witch. She is studying the history of science. She meets a geneticist who is a 1500 year old vampire. The historical references are very interesting. The book is well written, and the characters are complex, \\"prickly\\" is how the autor described them in the interview. I enjoyed this book so much that after I finished it I went back and listened to the author interview again.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|There is nothing more I can say that hasn't been said by so many others.  Seriously George, no more of these changes.  It would be so easy to offer the original theatrical version as well as these changes...
1451629184|5.0|This book was probably the best book I've ever read. I will admit though, in the beginning I put the book down and said I would read no more. After about a week, I picked it back up and starting reading again. Once I started back up, I never put it down until I was finished with the whole book. This woman is so courageous and inspiring. Just knowing what she went through and was able to come out on top like she has is amazing. A must read for all but you will deffinately need your tissues close by.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Adding \\"Nooooo!\\" to the end is just shameful.<br /><br />These movies have been changed so much over time, they aren't even similar to the early 80's releases anymore.
B003ZSJ212|2.0|I was considering buying this, but the recent word of new changes to the original trilogy (\\"Nooooo\\" anyone?) has got me off the fence.  I'm going to stick with my DVDs.    I have fond memories of the original trilogy as it used to be.  The \\"special edition\\" changes always kind of rubbed me the wrong way, but I wanted the DVDs anyway so I could share the movies with my kids.  And let's face it, whether Lucas wants to change his own movies or not is a little thing that barely has any impact on my overall life satisfaction.    Until now.  Because the new changes (especially the \\"noooooo\\" in Return of the Jedi, in what used to be one of my favorite scenes) bug me enough that I get to save $100 (or whatever) by not buying these Blu-rays.  Life satisfaction intact, +$100.    Why won't Lucasfilm release these with the audio and video corrected, effects cleaned up, but the original substance that we all love unchanged?  Seems like a no-brainer to me.

B0054YIQLW|4.0|Much has been written in these reviews regarding the great performances and fine quality of filmmaking in Francesco Rosi's film of Carmen. Here I am only going to comment on the new Blu-Ray edition.<br /><br />The Olive Films Blu-Ray disc of the 1984 film of Bizet's Carmen, featuring Julia Migenes and Placido Domingo, arrived today. I just finished watching it, then compared it to the Columbia-TriStar DVD version.<br /><br />Columbia's DVD had virtually no extras, just a couple of theatrical trailers, one being for this production of Carmen. It did have a choice of subtitles: English, Spanish, French, or none. It also had 24 scene chapters.<br /><br />The new Blu-Ray disc form Olive has a magnificent picture with great detail and the stereo soundtrack is wonderful. But it has absolutely no extras, just the film. The English subtitles are permanently on, as though it was like an old videotape where you cannot switch the subtitles on or off. There are no other choices - no Spanish or French titles, just English, British English it seems to this Yank, with spellings and phrases I am familiar with from watching BBC shows.(The \\"passers-by\\" are translated as \\"a rum bunch\\".) The scene chapters are also reduced to only 8, which makes it a bit tricky to find certain arias or music without having to shuttle the FWD-REV keys, again like the old tapes.<br /><br />I have no regrets in getting the Blu-Ray because of the outstanding high-def picture and sound, and I do need the Engish subs, even if I can't turn them off to practice my French. I just wish they could have provided a better overall product with at least as many chapters, at least as many subtitle languages (including \\"none\\"), and at least an extra or two, like Columbia did with the DVD.<br /><br />By the way, the Columbia DVD said the image was \\"presented in the originally filmed aspect ratio of 1.66:1\\" The new Blu-Ray says it is in 1.85:1. I looked for some corner details in the projected images of both versions, but they appear to be almost identical. My old VHS of Carmen is full frame and actually shows more picture information above and below the same picture on disc versions, indicating to me it must have been shot in 1.33:1. The IMDB lists 1.75:1 for camera, and the 70mm blowups as 2.20:1.
B004T5K3OK|5.0|As someone else pointed out, you can download the foundational free app from the official Android market, then just use Amazon to purchase this license to have the full version. it worked for me anyway. if you're wondering why anyone would do that, it's because market apps are updated far more quickly than apps on Amazon due to Amazon's process.<br /><br />Anyway this license to fully open up the app is a great deal at $1.99 and well worth it!<br /><br />Whether from here or the market, don't forget to install the basic free version BEFORE you download and install the license!!!
B0051T47NQ|5.0|I saw this movie at the Newport Beach Film Festival and laughed myself silly. Ambitious Norwegian college students working on a film project meet a disgruntled public servant who is sick of his lousy job. He gives the kids a real story, one they have a hard time believing because he shows them just what a hard, ugly job he really has. And the steps the government takes to protect an endangered species is truly amazing. This is a great movie and the lead actor really makes you believe his job is real.

B004ZZS4CC|4.0|I knew from the start this would be a heartwrenching book to read and that it was.  It is hard to remember when you read this book that this is a true story.  The horrible life Jaycee suffered at the hands of her kidnappers, Phillip and Nancy, is a true attest to the human soul's ability to hang on to even the slightest bit of faith.  And the fact that this lasted not only a few years, but nearly 20 years is a tragedy in itself.  I couldn't put my kindle down once I started the book and read it in 2 evenings time, probably 6-7 hours of reading.      If you are on the fence about reading this one, trust me, it is such an inspiring story that you won't be sorry you did.

B003XRZZFM|5.0|Loved the album, I've always loved Dimmu Borgir.  The best aspect is that they're symphonic involvement keeps getting greater and more intricate.      Who cares if this doesn't sound like black metal, bands that defy genres and create their own sound, I can't tell you how many \\"black metal\\" bands I've listened to that sound like meddled garbage.  ANother thing, how the hell does a BLACK METAL band sell out??? Who comes up with this crap?  Anyways...    Abrahadabra is an amazing album, I admit I will miss ICS Vortex, but whatever, Dimmu Borgir became what they did without him, so move on people, review how they adapted with 2 members lost.  They did AMAZING!!!!!!!!!    Only complaint I have is the clean vocals on \\"Ritualist\\", not very appealing, but one little nick in an album is alot better than I can say for most.    IN CONCLUSION!!!! This album is fantastic, brutal, YET melodic, songs are not songs without melody, symphonic, and the old Dimmu Borgir making a remarkable comeback from In Sorte Diaboli, which was an ok album, but no where near Abrahadabra's power.    BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!! Literally, support our underground metal music!!!!!!!

B000003EPN|5.0|Well, I agree with many others - this may well be the BEST Rigoletto on record for the past 60 years.<br />Anna Moffo as Gilda is simply unsurpassed. Her singing is not just beautiful - it is very human, very affecting, and she has the absolutely right charactersiation in every bit of stuff sung here. One thing for marvel - her coloraturas are not just for embellishment.  Like the past great coloraturas like Gencer, Caballe, Callas..., Moffo uses coloraturas to enhance the musical phrase, the lyrics, that is, for overall dramatic effect.  This is indeed makes coloraturas not only interesting but also cogent.<br />Alfredo Kraus' Duke of Mantua is also of great interest, as he does not bark, but manipulates the lyrics in each muscial phrase so as to convey the malice and spite in the script.  A truly masterful performance!<br />Robert Merrill is without doubt one of the best Rigolettos ever, with his warm expressive voice, and terrific musicality. He is, for personal taste, even better than Tito Gobbi in this role.<br />The young Georg Solti is both energetic and dramatic at the pit, and the tempi is sleek with tight dramatic tension throughout.<br />The only remaining bit is for RCA to reissue this in a delux set!!!

B004EJ14V2|5.0|Emma Stone did a great job at portraying a confused yet brilliant high school senior who didn't account for the severity of judgement in this day and age.  I enjoyed the clever, amusing, and extremely witty dialogue and excellent twists.  References to literature are abundant, and makes the movie that much funnier when you have read the book they are talking about. (Put down the bible once in a while and you may better understand the humor.)    On a different note, the funniest thing about the movie was actually some of the reviews I read afterwards.  The reviews regarding the negative light this movie put on religion made me laugh harder than I have in a while.  If you are religious, you probably won't like this movie because it does what religion can't afford; it portrays religion for what it is--judgmental and holier than thou mentality.      Anyway, I don't want to be preachy...great movie! Check it out.
B0051O8Z66|4.0|I purchased several digital tracks from the Progress album, but loved them so much I wanted to buy the CD. Then Progressed came out with a second CD and all new tracks on it. These songs are just as good as those on Progress. I'm not sure why it is so difficult to get Take That's newest music in the United States, but I'm glad I was able to finally get it!<br /><br />A few negatives though: the 2-CD set came in a flimsy plastic jewel case that didn't hold up well during shipping (most plastic jewel cases don't seem to last these days). Also, both discs look IDENTICAL with no writing or indication of which disc is which! Who's lousy idea was this? Doesn't matter to me, as I like all of the music.

B00005JKCH|4.0|After 25 years in development hell, Sam Raimi(The Evil Dead, Darkman) and Columbia Pictures brought Spiderman to the big screen in the Spring of 2002. The film does justice to Marvel's Spiderman comic books and it's fun to watch even if you've never read a comic book. Tobey MacGuire plays Peter Parker and his alter ego Spiderman. During a field trip, a radioactive spider escapes from its cage and it bites Parker on the hand! The spider bite gives him superpowers such as a \\"Spideysense\\" and the ability to shoot webs. In the comic book, Peter uses \\"prosthetic web shooters\\". In the Spiderman movies, the web shooters are organic. Peter Parker has a crush on Mary Jane(Kirsten Dunst), a redheaded girl who goes to the same high school.   After Peter's uncle Ben Parker(Cliff Robertson) is killed by a mugger, Peter fights crime as Spiderman. Spiderman has to help people as the malevolent, psychotic, power-hungry Green Goblin(Willem Dafoe) kills people in New York.    TV's Spiderman and his Amazing Friends(1982) and a Spiderman T-shirt that I wore in 1985 were my first exposure to Spiderman. Although, Spiderman has been around since the 1960's. A live action Spiderman movie project was passed around from studio to studio. Cannon Films had the Spiderman filmmaking rights at one time. At one time, James Cameron was going to direct the film.   A movie poster and a movie trailer with the World Trade Center was used to promote the Spiderman movie in 2001. Both disappeared after the Terrorist Attack on September 11th, 2001. Spiderman(2002) is jam-packed with patriotism and flag-waving.   The visual effects in Spiderman have been criticized for looking rubbery and cartoonish, but they get the job done. The visual effects in Spiderman 2(2004) and Spiderman 3(2007) make it up to us by having eye-popping, glossy visual effects. The late \\"Macho Man\\" Randy Savage plays a wrestler that Peter Parker fights in an arena. Lucy Lawless, Bruce Campbell, and director Sam Raimi make cameos in the film. Tobey MacGuire was an inspired choice for Peter Parker/Spiderman. He has to be mild-mannered, strong, and good-looking at the same time. Kirsten Dunst is quite good as Mary Jane. The upside down kissing scene is a classic. James Franco is quite good as Peter's friend, Harry Osborne. Willem Dafoe plays Norman Osborne and the Green Goblin. Rosemary Harris plays Aunt May and J.K. Simmons plays Daily Bugle chief J. Jonah Jameson. Danny Elfman's Spiderman music score is good. Spiderman was spoofed on The Simpsons and the \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic song 'Ode to a Superhero'.   John Dykstra(Star Wars, Batman Forever) crafted the visual effects for Spiderman(2002). This Columbia/Tri-Star/Sony DVD is packed with extra features. Spiderman was one of the best movies of 2002.

B0054N73EY|4.0|I will join the diehards who purchased this the first day and felt compelled to offer their two cents. Who would have thought the funk rockers of the 80s would have evolved into mellow rock and rollers?  A consistent, enjoyable stadium size rock band, no less.  Therein lies the first issue of letdown for some on I'm With You.  This is one mellow, laid back album.  Gone are the spattering of high energy songs from the superb double album, Stadium Arcadium.  The Chili Peppers are comfortable here playing tight grooves alongside a toned down mojo.  Not a problem with me, as the music is incredibly satisfying.      My biggest disappointment of I'm With You is the fact that the newcomer guitarist doesn't display any killer, catchy guitar hooks.  For a Chili Peppers album, that's a big, big deal!  No awe inspiring licks like Snow, Under the Bridge, Soul to Squeeze, Scar Tissue, etc.  Why?  His playing is indeed serviceable, and if you didn't know he replaced Frusciante, you may not notice it's not Frusciante playing on certain songs.  But whether or not he has the chops musically is yet to be determined, judging by the performance on this album.  One more nitpicky thing..many have commented on the ugly sounding guitar solo on \\"Rain Dance Maggie\\", and they're onto something.  This kind of solo might have sounded at home on Nirvana's In Utero, but it sounds completely out of place on I'm With You.  It just doesn't match the rest of the sound here.  Several of those solos are sprinkled throughout the album.  Again, a slight irritation to me.    But this album gets most things right.  Kiedis sounds remarkably well vocally considering he's been at this for 30 years.  His voice is still awesome.  Flea has been given more of a prominent role here.  Just about every track on the first half of the album begins with a bassline.  One new thing I really, really do like is the backing vocals of Josh.  He brings a different sound to RHCP, and it's a very nice welcome (Ex. \\"Did I Let You Know\\").     They didn't exactly play it safe here, either.  Sure, the formula guiding many of the songs' structures began around Californication/By The Way.  But, listen to Even You Brutus, Police Station, and Did I Let You Know.  Completely awesome stuff!    If the Peppers didn't lose you after morphing their sound back in the late 90s with Californication, than I don't see why you wouldn't like this.  Enjoy!
0061801313|4.0|Easy to read books...good for the younger set.  A bit different than the TV series so I don't think reading the books will be a spoiler.
B004WR125O|4.0|So after some trial and error I got the adapter connected and working correctly.    Here are my lessons learned that might help you save a few min.    1. Do the firmware update first via thumb drive or Ethernet connection. (I did thumb worked great.)    2. Note that your WEP password is CAPS sensitive so make sure you use the shift key to enter the letters in CAPS if your WEP password has capitalized letters in it.    3. If you successfully connected your UWF-1 then afterward installed the firmware update and are now receiving a \\"connection error\\" when accessing the web services you will have to reenter your connection information all over again for the connection to update correctly.    I'm giving this 4 stars simply because the receiver indicated that I was connected with a signal strength of 50+ which you would assume meant working correctly; though it wasn't connecting to the web services. Only after re-entering my connection information after the firmware update did the receiver A. show 50+ connection and B. accessed the web services.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The Hunger Games series in general is an absolutely incredible series that is well thought out, deep, riveting and has many underlying themes.  I loved all three of these books, and I must say, although some people have complaints about the third book I couldn't disagree anymore.  I thought Mockingjay really brought the series to a remarkable close- and kept it realistic at the same time.     Throughout the entire series one thing to keep in mind is, although it is a futuristic story, it is not meant to be a fantasy series.  That being said, the third book really humanized the characters for me- and reminded you that Katniss is not some all powerful, untouchable superhero, but is also still a 17 year old girl who had been faced with terrible situations throughout her life.  Collin's portrayal of Katniss' weaknesses in this story in my mind is not a downfall of the book, I would consider it one of Mockingjay's greatest assets- as no 17 year old child should be able to mentally handle all that Katniss has endured and still be expected to be strong.  I think that the change in Katniss' strength throughout this book was brilliant and made me feel like I was reading a real life war story and not just a futuristic fantasy.    The Hunger Games series left me thinking for days and days about the books and I have recommended them profusely to every reader that I know.  It is not until the third book though that I felt that I could connect the books to modern day society and to real war situations.  The development of the characters throughout the novels is flawless and makes you feel so deeply for each of them and their relationships.  For me, the character development of Peeta was the strongest and whenever he was in danger I really felt anxious (in an extremely engaged reader way) in worries he wouldn't be OK, and it is not often I feel so strongly about character's well beings.  Without attempting to spoil anything, throughout the novels, in the beginning I went back andforth between Peeta/Gale for Katniss and wasn't sure how Collins could resolve the love triangle- but thought it was handled perfectly in the end.    I highly recommend the entire Hunger Games series to any reader.  This series is one that you will NOT forget and will stay with you for a long long time.  I am looking for another series/book of this magnitude to take its place so please if anyone has suggestions - let me know- because I think Hunger Games will be hard to top!

0062060554|1.0|This is the worst book I have read in a long time. It was not at all believable. Poorly written and a waste of time.--Rene
0765324857|5.0|This book does a wonderful job of setting up the story for the games.  Find out the origins of Mr. Ryan and Fontaine, find out how the Little Sisters and the Big Daddys came to be, and bloody battles with demented splicers.  If you enjoyed the Bioshock games, this book is a must read!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|James Cameron hates it, Speilberg has come around, but George Lucas has not.  I've always said that George can do as much as he wants to his \\"vision\\" but give us an untouched theatrical edition on another disc.  I don't mean crappy laserdisc transfers either.  That's not acceptable in 2011.  I will not buy these movies again until the original version is included.  Not only are you tweaking your movies, but now messing with the emotional climax to Return of the Jedi.<br /><br />Enough is enough.

030788743X|5.0|I used to be one of those people who read a book a day, literally. I was that way for years...But life changed and things changed and I find it hard to fit in more than a few books a year. I read this in one day. It was good enough and so strongly appealed to my geeky, sci-fi-loving heart that I put everything else on hold. (Aka I was totally irresponsible because I \\"needed\\" to keep reading.) The ideas are great, the plot is well laid out, and the writing is engaging (whether making me laugh or making me cringe). If there's even a little geek in your soul, feed it this most excellent book!
B00007GZR5|5.0|When I first saw this movie I was quite moved by how everyone played their parts and how the meaning of soul mates came around in which made me believe there is an afterlife after death of your life on earth like you can create you re own heaven; you re own world if you wish it to be so. I think this movie has quite alot of meaning behind it and i am thrilled to own it!!
B004YEJGEO|4.0|Superb app. The only complaint I have is that there should be a REAL undo. Sometimes the most innocuous of moves can wreak havoc on a carefully-laid out board, causing you to have to go back a dozen or more moves. Still, despite that ... FANTASTIC APP!
6302206294|5.0|I had owned a recorded copy of this but it was sadly recorded long ago on a tv station with commericals and subtitles as well along with that they'd cut out parts of the movie as well so when I saw this i just had to get it!! I love every minute of it from when Robin is in that rotten jail to when he s married to Mairion along with the added video of Bryan Adams during the credits of his hit song in that movie. All in all I would say for any Robin Hood or Kevin Costner fan would be proud to own this slice of history and a great movie of the 90s as well.
B00479SVBU|5.0|After much research on various products, I decided on purchasing the Soundfly Aux. I have 4 different FM receivers that I bought for my iTouch, but none have lasted more than a few months. Now while I don't know how long the Soundfly is going to last, it is very user friendly and everything that I have been looking for. Most importantly, I don't need to use my iTouch or iPhone in the unit. I just transferred songs from my computer to a flash drive and I was ready to go. There are two drawbacks that I have found so far...and they are minor. The 1st is that it will only play MP3 downloads so anything that is MP4 won't play. The other concern is when I put the unit on shuffle it just doesn't shuffle the playlist that is playing, but all of the songs on the flash drive. Other than that, the Soundfly is great and I would recommend it to anyone who would like to have access to their music files on the go.
B004SDSSFY|1.0|I used this program successfully on my pc. For my LG Ally, it is a disaster. On all of several updates, it put me back to the free version every time, causing no end of difficulties with Dataviz to get things corrected and the paid-for version enabled. It also messed up my filing system. Highly disappointed, I unloaded the free version but not the key which I paid $14.99 for. I simply do not use Dataviz any more and do not recommend it. Use Dropbox and you'll be much happier -- and it's free.

0894803123|4.0|Good book with lots of really good recipes.  Be careful of the amounts, particulary if the recipe calls for alcohol. We made the Kaluha fudge almond, and had to reduce the Kaluha to half what the recipe called for in order to get ice cream and not slush.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|This Sonic Screwdriver is awesome. I love Doctor Who it's probably one of my favorite shows ever. Now I'm a relatively new \\"Whovian\\", but my first and probably favorite Doctor was David Tennant aka the 10th Doctor.    When I saw this Sonic Screwdriver I said, \\"I got to get that thing!\\" I think the idea of it making the lights and sounds are awesome and that it is also a pen is pretty cool too. I figured it could also come in handy if I need to right something down or if the lights were to go out and I need to find a flashlight or something I can use my Sonic. However, the light isn't bright enough to use as a flashlight itself it's good to use when there is nothing else but still. Also I don't like to use the light too much myself because I don't want to waste the life in the batteries because they're small batteries.     When you unscrew it to put in the batteries make sure to screw it back in, nice and tight. At first I thought maybe I don't want it to be too tight or it won't slide open and close. I was wrong, if you don't screw it back in tight it can come out and you can lose pieces, which I almost did.    Also it doesn't come with the psychic paper which was a little disappointing because I wanted some but it didn't take away from the awesomeness of the Sonic.    This screwdriver is exactly what I expected...awesomeness! If your a \\"Whovian\\" too, I say buy it, it's worth having.    I'm sure we all would want it to be able to do all of the cool things that it can in the show and maybe far into the future it could, but for now I can settle with nostalgia and what it already does.
0553801473|1.0|I can get over the feasting...the long descriptions of interesting food and drink.  I can even get over the multiplying POV's (hey, i stuck with Jordan through all of WoT).  What drove me crazy was the reuse of the same phrases throughout the book.  \\"Words are wind\\" \\"you know nothing Jon\\" \\"though I'm an innocent girl\\" please, please, PLEASE, if we are going to take a painstaking trek through your new fantasy world, show us some more cultures with different sayings that aren't old after 10 chapters.
B001B472OQ|5.0|This movie is a classic and not very easy to find.  It came in the original box and played wonderfully.  I will certainly do business with them again. It is exactly as advertised.
B004Y1USJE|5.0|Yes is one of those bands that I love no matter which lineup is currently working.  That being said, I jumped aboard the YesWorld bandwagon with the album \\"Drama.\\"  I didn't know that much about them then, so didn't care who was \\"supposed\\" to be singing or playing keyboards.  Therefore, I judged that album at face value and believed it to be one of best prog-rock albums of all time.  I believe that still.    Needless to say, I was very excited to hear that \\"Fly From Here\\" boasts the same basic lineup as on \\"Drama,\\" with the exception of Horn singing...sort of...Trevor Horn adds backing vocals, which makes the sound complete to my ears.  \\"Fly From Here\\" is not nearly as dramatic (for lack of a better word) as \\"Drama\\" but the sound is there and it is still very magical.  To me, it is the \\"middle-aged\\" version of \\"Drama\\" so it makes sense to me that it is more mellow than it's predecessor.    Bottom line?  The songs on \\"Fly From Here\\" are beautiful.  In fact, I believe this to be the most listenable Yes album in their catalog.  (Check out \\"Hour Of Need\\"!!!)    And the icing on the cake is that Chris Squire's bass sound still kicks butt!

1609611543|5.0|William Davis, MD, is a preventive cardiologist who blames Low HDL cholesterol, high triglycerides and small LDL particles for the rise in heart disease. This also leads to high blood pressure, high blood sugar, diabetes and pre-diabetes, increased inflammation, increasingly blood clot-prone blood.  This is caused by the condition Dr. Davis calls \\"wheat belly\\".    Wheat belly is the much like the \\"beer belly\\" with the same protruding, sagging abdomen that develops when you overindulge in processed carbohydrates. It represents visceral fat that laces the intestines.    While nearly everyone knows that candy bars and soft drinks aren't good for health, most Americans have allowed processed carbohydrates, but especially wheat products like pretzels, crackers, breads, waffles, pancakes, breakfast cereals and pasta, to dominate diet.     Nutritionists have warned against plain white bread and steered us in another direction. According to the author, today's health-conscious decision to eat more whole grains may be more of the problem than the solution. In his view, it is some grains (like wheat) that are largely behind the obesity and diabetes epidemic.  Grains like oats and flaxseed don't seem to contribute to weight and the associated patterns like small LDL.      Dr. Davis suggests we eliminate all forms of wheat - no breakfast cereals, no breads of any sort, no pasta, crackers, pretzels, etc. Instead, increase your vegetables, healthy oils, lean proteins (lean red meats, chicken, fish, turkey, eggs, yogurt and cottage cheese), raw nuts like almonds, walnuts, and pecans, and fruit. Of course, avoid fruit drinks, candy, and other garbage foods, even if they're wheat-free.     According to Davis, most people will report that a cloud has been lifted from their brain. Thinking is clearer, they have more energy and they sleep more deeply. Most people lose the insatiable hunger pangs that occur 2-3 hours after a wheat-containing meal.  Sounds good, doesn't it?    Why such an impact from a \\"natural\\" food source like wheat? Because this is not the same grain your parents ate.  Food engineering may create more food but not always better. If you want more information on this, I suggest reading [[ASIN:B00025G3DG Food, Inc. : Mendel to Monsanto--The Promises and Perils of the Biotech Harvest]]. To get a better view of the business of food, you may want to watch the video \\"Food Inc\\" and then read [[ASIN:1595584269 The World According to Monsanto: Pollution, Corruption, and the Control of the World's Food Supply]].  It was interesting to read about the effects on people from a doctor's point of view.    My Thoughts:    I enjoyed Dr. Davis' writing style, not like you might expect from a doctor.  His experiences with his patients are fascinating. It is evident that he is passionate about this, and not just trying to promote a book.    I agree with Dr. Davis that processed foods are the major cause of obesity in America. This was a fascinating book to read but I also found it alarming that just about everything is made with wheat.  Dr. Davis's research has proven that by eliminating wheat from our diets we can eliminate the dreaded fat tire around our midsection.  Unfortunately, some people may still have a hard time giving up their favorite foods because wheat is so prevalent.    I have found through muscle testing that a large percentage of people are sensitive to wheat. Could the elimination of wheat from your diet really eliminate the \\"wheat belly\\" around your middle?  Read this book and find out!

I have worn  it more than the rest of my collection in the last few weeks, so much so it has become the favourite. I like the larger size watches but this one has somehow got under my guard. It's great value and I would recommend it without hesitation.
B00197X140|5.0|This album is a catalog of the bands journey so far. They started as a promising metal band and gradually graduated to a band which is extraordinary amongst extraordinaire. Very few Bands or individuals have the ability to define their own genre (Anathema is to progressive/Atmospheric Metal, what Kurt Cobain was to Grunge). This is undoubtedly one of the best work of last 2 decades in this field. The music connects with you and takes you places.    Watch out for Falling Deeper, It is the best Album I have listened to in the last few years. It a masterpiece of masterpieces. The best of Anathema, truly speaking its rare for me to fall short of words to describe something. But the fact it, this album needs to be felt, their is no other way to describe it.    Anathema is a band, which will outlive their lifetime and transcendent to the domain, where one achieve immortality, by virtue of ones work.
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|Got this CD for my birthday.  When I saw the artist name I knew it would be great and it is.  Just what I thought it would be.
B002QBS9KE|5.0|I just bought a set of mediums after going through about 5 earpieces.  I always wear my original Voyager Pro from the time I wake till before I sleep. Been doing this for around two years. The best Bluetooth headset with the most comfortable earpieces. I always used them without the sponge cover but now on my sixth earpiece (the silicone rips from me pulling it in and out of my ear) I opted to try the sponge cover over the silicone. Boy did I miss even more comfort and better fit. Don't get me wrong as it fit just great without the sponge cover but I find it even MORE comfortable now. The reason I pull it out of my ear is that sometimes I can't hear people clearly especially because I am a bit hard of hearing. I hang my headset on the collar of my shirt also and pull it off of my shirt which probably pulled on the silicone also thereby reducing the silicone's lifespan. These earpieces are the best and so is my Voyager Pro. If and when this Pro model dies I will just upgrade to the Pro Plus model or the Voyager UC.
B002VKE1K2|2.0|I spent most of this movie thinking, \\"When does something actually happen?\\"  Sorry, but an invisible entity making some thumping noises, moving a door, and turning on and off some lights, isn't particularly scary to me.  There was a point where I felt the movie might have taken a turn for the truly creepy, when the psychic first came in and reviewed Katie's history with the entity going back to her early childhood, and discussed the difference between ghosts and demons.  Building upon *that*, and exploring why the \\"demon\\" chose her and followed her all these years, and doing more than just banging on the walls, might have made this a truly classic horror film, albeit one with a slow start.  But they dropped the ball halfway through.  By the time something physical actually *happened,* I no longer really cared.  Even the ending, supposedly \\"shocking,\\" just elicited a shrug from me.  The DVD I saw had an alternate ending, but no scene-selection menu - and yes, I was curious enough to fast-forward through the entire dull-as-dishwater film a second time, in hopes that the alternate ending would redeem itself - but no, it was equally as dull.  I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 for a couple of good moments and because I didn't utterly *hate* it - but I did find it entirely uninspired and disappointing.  BTW, I have plenty of imaginative capacity - but I guess I lack enough of a belief in a malevolent universe to fill in the blanks and write most of the story in my own mind.  That, to me, is the role of the filmmaker, not the audience.
B000TEUSJK|5.0|I saw this movie years ago and was amazed at how much was edited.  Very good movie with superb acting.  I didn't particularly like the torture scenes but overall a very good movie.

B000X1Z0BU|5.0|I recently saw this movie and it goes up there with one of my all time favorites.  It takes a unique twist on the \\"boy meets girl\\" dynamic.  If you want to make it comparable to another script it is part Music and Lyrics and part Before Sunrise, but truly this movie stands on it's own.<br /><br />What makes this movie outstanding outside of the phenomenal soundtrack (which are all ORIGINAL songs for this movie ...when was the LAST time you can say that about a contemporary movie??) is the beautiful portrayal of the touching relationship between the man and woman.  For a moment it borders on the clich&eacute; romance but their relationship connects more on the creative level.  Watching these two develop music together is nothing short of magical.  It gave me chills to see how each other's talents just blossomed when they were working together.  The music is unbelievably good.  The lyrics are heartbreaking and the piano and guitar and the harmonizing voices are fantastic.  I was reminded of Joan Biaz, Bob Dylan and Simon and Garfunkel while listening ...again though the comparisons aren't quite right ...it's that different.<br /><br />What I also love is the subtle realism of this movie.  It doesn't have the flashy lights or the BIG dramatics or the drop dead gorgeous actors who hair and make up is so perfect that they look good from any angle.  It was shot creatively but felt almost like a documentary.  It allows you to connect with the situations deeper than any movie.  For example, when the girl was walking the streets up late b/c she just had to finish getting her thoughts down for a song, I was instantly transported back to so many nights when I did that writing down thoughts for papers at college or when I had to figure out my thoughts for a personal conflict and was compelled to walk until I finished.  Everything about the situation felt genuine, from the way she emptied out every remote in the house to how she ran out to the corner store in those ridiculous slippers.  I understood her character on a level I normally don't when watching a movie.<br /><br />I would be remiss not to mention the music again.  I had never heard of either of these artists before watching this movie.  However I didn't feel like it was an unabashed attempt at self promotion.  The story was just as exceptional as the music.<br />If you are looking for a good STORY, wonderful ACTING and excellent MUSIC this is the flick for you.  However, if you are into cheap thrills, flashy car chases, and huge overblown drama ...it probably won't do a thing for you.her character on a level I normally don't when watching a movie.

B004I8WD7S|4.0|This case isn't going to set the world on fire, but $9 for a case and a screen saver is a very good deal. The case is translucent and seems reasonably protective; I don't care for the cutout over the Apple logo, which seems pointless (you can see through the case!), and a bit tacky. The screen protector went on easily and fit nicely. (Hint: Install it in a steamy bathroom to cut down on specks of dust.)

B0049P1VHS|5.0|I was afraid to see how they would mess up the comic and when I saw the mistakes they actually worked out in the end. I liked the different way they started it because it's still in the essence of the comic where the zombies aren't the main focus they are just the backdrop. Speaking of which these zombies are the most realistic zombies I have seen. They can't exactly run due to coordination issues but they aren't exactly slow either they just kinda stumble and shamble towards you. And the greater the number the scarier they are because all of a sudden you are completely surrounded. So it gets the terrifying aspect of the zombies but that's not what you are watching most of the time. It's more focused on characterization and a kind of \\"how far would you go to save yourself\\" situation but it's not just you which is what we normally think about. There's family still living with you in this \\"world ruled by the dead\\" like your wife or husband maybe child or grandparent what if it was your best friend the one person you thought you could trust to have your back no matter what. How would this change the group dynamic on who is on whose side? That's what makes this brilliant it presents all of the real world aspects into it all of the problems that would have to be dealt with.

B003VPWXRO|5.0|I have this thirst to know the inner workings of people, and Unbearable Lightness was something that I had seen and wanted to read for quite sometime because I had seen Portia on Oprah, and I wanted to know more. Her words, at times hit me with alternating waves of shock, confusion, and, in a strange way, a bit of awe because she had had the courage to look so honestly within herself with the act of writing the book. If you do have an eating disorder, though, I'll warn you that  there areplaces in the book that you may find triggering. Portia speaks of her recovery, yes, but in the epilogue. She writes from her view during the battles with Anorexia and Bulimia, the sister disorders that nearly killed her, so recovery was only mentioned briefly. What I can say though is that reading the book helped me to understand what someone who is suffering goes through, and it's for that reason that I'd highly recommend it to the family of any sufferer if you seek a deeper understanding of the illnesses, or more simply, of one courageous woman's struggle to find her true self. Thank you, Portia, for sharing your struggle with us. It was very brave, and I hope you keep loving yourself just the way that you are. I speak to everyone who reads this when I say: the things that make us perfect are our imperfections, and we are all perfect in our own special ways
B0051MKMNC|5.0|It's hard for me to explain what my title is indicating but you really should approach this movie with an open mind; a mind of a \\"WHAT IF?\\" mentality. I loved it from start to end. The Alternate ending wasn't to get excited about and I'm glad they left it out the release. Overall, an awesome movie that I'm sure will be a classic.
B0054N73EY|5.0|When I first heard John left the band I didn't expect the Chili Peppers to put out a new album.  And then I immediately thought of \\"One Hot Minute\\".  \\"One Hot Minute\\" wasn't their best album, but does have some good songs.  My husband is a huge Navarro fan and doesn't really agree.  Oh and I think Stadium Arcadium could have been one disc with all the good songs on the one disc.    So, I heard Rain Dance Maggie on the radio a few weeks before the album was set to be released.  I loved it and had to come home and download it.  I probably played it twenty times in two days.  No joke.    I bought the album yesterday.  My husband has to have an actual album so he can look at it, blah blah blah.  I really don't care.  I loaded it on my ipod and gave him the hard copy.  We listened it while eating dinner last night and both really liked it.  We think it has a huge alternative sound.  Flea definitely dominates on this album.  Josh is really good.  He's not John, he's not trying to be John.  I think he mentions that in their Rolling Stone interview.      The first song is freakin' amazing!  Every time I listen to it, it gives me goosebumps!  I can't stop listening to it.  There are a couple of songs that are alright, but the rest are awesome!      Buy this album and don't have expectations about John vs. Josh.  Go in with no expectations and you won't be disappointed.
B0051GOB26|3.0|The Coen's live in their own universe and, luckily for us, it's a wacky one that they get to put on film and we get to visit. The Coen's do a wacky black comic variation on Raymond Chandler with their film \\"The Big Lebowski\\".<br /><br />The ride that we take in Coenland this time around involves The Dude aka Lebowski(Jeff Bridges)an unemployed bowler who is mistaken for the wealthy Lebowski who's Lolita-like wife is kidnapped and held for ransom. The only problem is that The Dude finds himself involved in the exchange of the money for Mrs. Lebowski--except the money is stolen. Add in John Goodman as a slightly deranged gun toting convert to Judeaism who wants to keep the ransom money and Jesus (John Turturro)a fancy dressing bowler who likes to lick his ball before bowling for a soup of wacky characters. A terrific supporting cast includes Julianna Moore, Steve Buscemi among others only enhances this black comedy with their mixture of eccentric and deadpan performances.<br /><br />I've read a couple of reviews of \\"The Big Lebowski\\" indicating that this is a nearly flawless transfer. I'd disagree. It looks decent but suffers from too much DNR smoothing over the skin textures to an unnatural degree--they don't look like wax figures but the film could look a bit better. There's also evidence of edge enhancement in several early scenes where The Dude meets Mr. Lobowski. This isn't much of an improvement over the DVD and evidently was pulled from the same source as the HD-DVD transfer from a couple of years back.<br /><br />It's a very poor effort from Universal in terms of the transfer itself. If you're not picky about your Blu-ray image quality, you'll think this looks just fine for those who are you will be somewhat disappointed. There's good and bad about the transfer.<br /><br />The 5.1 lossless mix sounds exceptionally good--it's a pity the film isn't presented with as much care.<br /><br />The extras are really good--we get a really good making of featurette as well as a paen to \\"The Dude\\" housed in a hardcover Blu-ray holder with a booklet filled with photos. The U Control feature here allows trivia to pop up now and again and a counter that keeps track of all the profanity in the film (and there's a lot).<br /><br />We also get Jeff Bridges' photo album, \\"Flying Carpets and Bowling Pins\\" a featurette on the dream sequence for the film and an interactive map.<br /><br />While the extras are very good, the transfer of the film itself is disappointing.<br /><br />Five stars for the movie, 2 stars for the transfer--shame on you Universal!lu-ray holder with a booklet filled with photos.

1557427283|5.0|The Strunk and White style guide may be one of the most important tools for a writer, though the guide fails to receive its much-deserved accolades.  Prior to any journal submission, technical document, research proposal or paper, and any other major undertaking, I re-read 'The Elements of Style' from cover-to-cover.  Though other fine style guides may be found, and I have read many of them, Strunk and White's remains compact, concise, and focuses on the key points of writing.<br /><br />For those of you that feel like investing a few extra dollars, I highly recommend the hardcover fiftieth anniversary edition, though it contains no additional secrets within.
B002RSDW80|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this movie and I had taped it on VHS but wanted it on DVD.  I have already watched it probably 15 times.  I usually put it in while I am working around the house and listen to it, that is why I say I have watched it so many times.  I have several movies I do this way.  Just by hearing the dialog I can tell what is happening on the screen without having to watch it.  The delivery was quick which is something I appreciate.
0345529057|5.0|Ok, how do I talk about how great this series is with out giving away all the details. Sure there are plenty of spoilers out there but I don't want to ruin anything for the people who want to enjoy it for themselves. I guess I'll start off with some things that I've read in various professional reviews, this series is better then LotR, better then Harry Potter, and something I thought I'd never say....it's even better then Star Wars. To put some of that into perspective. I've read the entire LotR series, and I strongly feel the George R R Martin does a much better job at story telling then Tolkien ever did. That is because of the fast pace of Martin's writing. It's extremely fast pace, but still sufficiently long and in depths, but that rapid pace keeps you hooked. He is also willing to make his writting mature and specifically target the 18+ demographic of readers. I've read the entire HP series three times and I've read every progressive story line Star Wars books that's ever been released. A Song of Fire and Ice puts them all to shame.    I never knew of this series until I watch the show. The show was so good it made me want to see how much better the books could be, because they always are. I have to say Martin and HBO did a much, much, much, much, MUCH better job of translating book to screen then Rowling ever did with Harry Potter. The last couple movies in particular were down right insults to their books yet Rowling worked personally on each movie. She let her books be butchered and then stood behind them like it was some great accomplishment. For \\"A Game of Thrones\\" there were obviously some things that were cut, changed or added, but they didn't ruin the story in any way. But that is a necessary evil since you don't get the benefit of internal monologues on screen like you do in print. But they did not completely destroy the story like they did with Harry Potter.     I've never read fantasy books in my life. (Fantasy as in Knights, Castles and Dragons) But I'm very glade I read A Song of Fire and Ice, and you will be too.

B002SSUQFG|5.0|I am very pleased with this watch. I am tired of replacing a watch battery only to have the thing fail. I had a Timex automatic many years ago and got long service from it. The Seiko appears to be a very high quality watch and at a very good price. I love the see-though case in the back. It is not sticky to wear like a metal case. The nylon wristband is high quality. Another great Amazon find.

0374158460|1.0|The characters are impotent, unhappy, and in most cases, morally bankrupt.  There appears to be no redeeming lesson or interesting social commentary to the story.  I don't need a happy ending, but why would I want to read so long a book that has no point?  Don't waste your time.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Dear Mr. Lucas: Here are some changes that you should consider making to the trilogies now that you've really unleashed the beast on fans. (In no particular order.)<br /><br />* Luke can be Asian now. Because why not? Let the race-bending commence.<br />* Han and Greedo should shoot at the exact same time, removing any moral subjectivity and also anything interesting about the standoff scene in the cantina on Mos Eisley.<br />* Lando should have a really cool hat on.<br />* Anakin and Padme should have more private one-on-one conversations about that strange foreboding feeling they keep getting.<br />* Harrison Ford could do voice-overs for all six films.<br />* Obi-Wan should get laid at some point.<br />* C3PO should be re-voiced by Mike Myers doing a Scottish accent.<br />* Jawas vs. Ewoks.<br />* Peter Dinklage as Palpatine. The Yoda fight would be even cooler then.<br />* Phantom Menace could just be ONE LONG POD RACE.<br />* Wookiee sex. Lots of it.<br />* Uncle Owen should smack Luke around some. The kid is just asking for it.<br />* Jabba has legs now. OH SHI-<br />* Give Salacious Crumb a cool hat just like Lando.<br />* Have Boba kill an Orc at some point.<br />* Order 66 is really just the cue for Mace Windu's surprise birthday party. He gets a new light saber and a wallet that says Bad Midi-chlorian on it.<br />* An elaborately choreographed Wampa dance routine to the tune of \\"One\\" from A Chorus Line.<br />* Change the opening overture to Yakety Sax.<br />* Don't ever let Spock kiss Uhura again... oh... wait. Sorry. I mean, Darth Vader should never cry.<br />* Make all Stormtroopers sparkle.<br />* Christopher Walken as R2-D2's voice.
B0054N73EY|5.0|One of the most amazing musicians, guitar players of the last twenty years just quit a band and just like I was thinking, you may have been thinking it was all over.    You need to step into some big shoes to fill Frusciante. What better replacement than basically a collaborator and understudy of Frusciante and has been friends with Johnny and the band for a while. Josh Klinghoffer might have seemed underwhelming in the first single, \\"The Adventures of Raindance Maggie\\" but by backing off a little he really let flea shine and then Chad brings in this funky cowbell beat that you can hear clearly.    It's a different Chili Peppers, but this album just like my favorite chili peppers album (Blood Sugar Sex Magik) will require a few returns. You need to listen to the whole thing a few times, process it and then you can focus on the awesomeness of each individual part whether it be some sick cowbell, or random funky riff.     Basically, Josh is a great guitarist and he definitely shows it in the record but he doesn't solo as much (don't get me wrong he has some pretty well placed sick solos) but by not playing as aggressively, Chad and Flea REALLY shine on the album while Josh keeps it real and channels the Peppers style flawlessly.     Can't wait to see them on tour. How epic would it be if Frusciante joined them on tour to play a couple of shows and take care of all the sweet chili peppers guitar layering (they could play I could have lied with the electric guitar soloing over the acoustic rhythm guitar LIVE!) Anyway, if you are a Chili Peppers fan at all, you won't regret buying this album. Just give it a few listens. Also pay close attention to Josh's playing. The more you listen to it, the more you understand it and realize what an amazing musician he is.
1416972250|5.0|\\"City of Glass\\", by Cassandra Clare was enthralling and action packed from the moment I picked it up until the moment I put it down. It is hard to believe that this is not the last book in the Mortal Instruments series, as it seems the perfect ending to a trilogy. This book was so packed with adventure and discoveries that it would have easily made two books.<br /><br /> \\"City Of Glass\\" picks up pretty much immediately where \\"City of Ashes\\" leaves off. The Lightwoods, Jace, and Clary are portaging into Alicante in Idris but Jace has other plans, plans that don't include Clary going making the journey to Idris. Ever determined, Clary finds her way to Idris regardless, followed by Luke who is attempting to stop her portal. Luke too finds himself in Idris, breaking the Clave's law barring Downworlders from Alicante. Now, Luke and Clary are both in Idris against the law.<br /><br /> Unknown to Clary, Simon has also illegally found his way into rIdris, against the law of course. Now Simon is being in a cell by the Clave- he doesn't know Clary is in Idris and she is unaware of his presence as well. A host of new characters in introduced in this novel and most of them are well done too.<br /><br /> Valentine is trying to get his hands on the third Mortal Instrument and it is up to the Nephilim to stop him. Ultimately, as you may expect, this book has a huge battle scene in Idris. Several things I have been waiting for have finally been resolved in this novel. Clary's mother reveals a lot of background information on Valentine that could have been an entire novel in itself, I was so enthralled by it. Clary finally discovers her true calling and the source of her odd abilities to create seemingly new Runes.<br /><br /> Not only that but Clary finally has a shot at romance....this time not with her brother. I really wish Cassandra Clare would have written more romance in because it was just too good. I could not get enough and really... I didn't. I must say that while I was fairly certain where everything was going, and it turned out I was correct, I did appreciate Clare's little hint with the Shakespeare's \\"Twelfth Night\\" quote. That pretty much solidified any doubt I had about what was happening.<br /><br /> This is also the first of the Mortal Instrument books in which I finally got Jace. I finally realized what it was that Clary saw in him and just how irresistible it could be. And it was the first book in which it didn't turn my stomach that he was her brother, he was just good enough for me to get over it.<br /><br /> As much as I am wary of a fourth book in this series because I am doubtful it could live up to this novel, I can't wait to pick up \\"City of Angels\\". It's kind of disappointing that this third novel is most assuredly the best of the first three. Hopefully, people can get through decent novels enough to get to this one they will surely love.everything was going, and it turned out I was correct, I did appreciate Clare's little hint with the Shakespeare's \\"Twelfth Night\\" quote.

B004G600A4|3.0|How do you tell the traditional fairy tale - princess locked away in a tower only to be rescued by dashing hero - in a CGI format for modern audiences?  The answer is...Tangled.<br /><br />The staples are all here: the adorably wide-eyed princess Rapunzel (Mandy Moore), the handsome rogue Flynn (as in Errol) Rider (Zachary Levi), the villainous stepmother Gothel (Donna Murphy), and two heroic critters - Maximus the lawful good warhorse and Pascal the chameleon (voice by Frank Welker, master of the entire animal-voiced kingdom). A magical flower falls to earth that has restorative powers that heals the wounded and promise eternal youth, but when the queen's childbirth becomes...difficult, the flower is turned into a poultice, bestowing its curative effects on the young princess. The problem is that Mother Gothel was using the flower to keep her eternally youthful and, upon realizing that Rapunzel's hair now has the same powers, kidnaps the girl and raises the child as her own.<br /><br />Whew.  Got all that?  Early on, it becomes clear Gothel is blessed with superhuman abilities to do evil things.  She is basically an old lady who really, really likes being youthful.  We never get any insight as to why this is - she never flirts with anybody, so it's surely not for the obvious reasons - and so Gothel becomes a cipher helped conveniently by the plot.  She gets the drop on two huge thugs! Tangled was obviously uncomfortable turning Gothel into another witch, but I kept hoping she had some magical tricks up her sleeve.<br /><br />Speaking of Gothel, she acts like Faye Dunaway from Mommy Dearest and looks like Cher. She is manipulative, loving, protective, and saps her daughter's self-esteem at every turn.  Gothel is, in other words, a post-modern villain palatable to audiences who are unlikely to accept a stepmother that managed to keep her daughter in a tower for nearly two decades. And yet, once Gothel's secret is out she transforms into an unrepentant harpy.<br /><br />Gothel's manipulative skills are at their peak when she sings \\"Mother Knows Best.\\"  Given the breathtaking old-school style of animation the film invokes, it's a shame that the music simply can't keep up. The actors rarely launch into full-throated song, preferring instead to half-talk, half-sing their way into and out of what should be true theatrics.  In fact, Tangled at times feels like a Broadway play, unwilling to go all-out because the director fears his cast can't hit the high notes.  There's not a single memorable song in Tangled's hairnet.<br /><br />Flynn Rider has his own problems.  His age is indecipherable, but it's certainly older than eighteen-year-old Rapunzel. He's been around long enough to have a reputation as a lady's man and an accomplished thief, which makes him old enough to know better, but never mind that. Rider narrates the tale but rarely hasn't much of interest to say- his narration could have been removed completely without affecting the story.  Also, Rider's a world class jerk, backstabbing his partners in crime for no other reason than greed.  Even the other characters point out that his dream (to have a private island with piles of money) is terrible. Rider eventually gets it knocked into his head (literally) that Rapunzel is his dream...which is a bit of an uncomfortable message (you're either greedy or utterly devoted to your spouse), but not unexpected for a Disney film.<br /><br />Just about every character in Tangled has a surprising dark streak that saps their fairy-tale qualities.  Maximus is willing to slit Rider's throat, Pascal gleefully defenestrates an old lady, and even Rapunzel turns on her formerly beloved stepmother in the blink of an eye. The most lovable characters are the self-confessed rogues at the Snugly Duckling.<br /><br />Tangled wants to have it both ways - edgy and innocent, fairy-tale and girl power - but ends up somewhere in between.

B0012909NQ|5.0|I have been a Genesis fan from the begining. I lean more toward the epic songs rather than the short pop songs.  This is by far the best live produced Genesis dvd on the market.  The song selections is perfect with the exception that they left out material from Abacab.  My favorite high-lite is the In The Cage Medley with the full version of Afterglow (priceless).  Of course the guys have gotten old like the rest of us, but are at high standard for this show and they closed it down in style.  The back drop of Rome and the 500,000 people that showed up to see this event is quite impressive.  The bottom line, this dvd does not let down....enjoy!
159420229X|5.0|I'm tempted to give this book 1-star just to dissuade more people from reading it. It's THAT good. Or, I should say, it is THAT important.<br /><br />Many people say that this book isn't a self-help book. Perhaps these people can only learn when spoken to in a didactic tone... which is quite sad considering this book is most definitely a self-help book if, like the rest of us, you're able to learn vicariously through others.<br /><br />With that said, it's not the BEST self-help book ON MNEMONICS IN PARTICULAR. Look to Dominic O'Brien for that. HOWEVER, it is BY FAR the BEST entry-level self-help book into the field of mental-calisthenics. BY FAR.<br /><br />If you have read The Game and caught the bug, then you would understand. This book is essentially just The Game for Mental-Athletes. It presents you with a taste of a world that you never knew existed, giving you just enough information to take some steps through the door. If you're interested, you'll go deeper. If you're not interested, well, you didn't have to invest that much anyway. Win-Win.<br /><br />Foer may not have cured his occasional absent mindedness... but who cares really? He says his memory hasn't improved... but don't be a fool. The question is: what are you using your memory for, or what are your goals? There's no doubt that if Foer were still a student he would be running circles around his former self.... then again, I can't see who else would be interested in this except for students or those thirsty for knowledge (whether that be formally or informally ie students of life). I mean, it's a good read nonetheless, but I read it as self-help -- not as a novel.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you're interested in KNOWING MORE (and remembering it), then you're going to get a taste of what you're asking for.<br /><br />I only wish he had included a further-reading section. In fact, I think it's totally stupid that he didn't. He simply leaves those who want more to their own internet scavenging... then again, maybe it's best some of this stuff isn't so easy to come by.gain, maybe it's best some of this stuff isn't so easy to come by.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|His tampering is malicious and unending. People think that I've overreacted sometimes in the past but it looks like this new 'Nooo!' revelation might be the final straw for a lot of otherwise committed fans. Even for fans that normally would blindly bend over and over again for Lucas' repeated buggerings this could, and should be, the final straw. How many times can fans bend over before their a** is bloodied and raw?!      I stick to my difficult and final conclusion that Lucas has indeed lost his mind. It doesn't take Nostradamus to realize that he will never, EVER stop tampering with these cultural masterpieces, which I personally believe is open contempt for his creations and his fans.    I have my untouched/unedited VHS copies that look and work perfectly fine, and although I'm sure in his sick and twisted mind he would like to destroy every copy that doesn't fit his demented revisionism, mine is safe and sound on the shelf until the next viewing, unfettered by the madness and endless tampering of Darth George.
B004EBUXSA|5.0|I have to start by saying that this Intel processor is just super fast, REALLY EASY to overclock even your grandma can do it (lol search for the video in youtube) and depending on how you see it, the price is awesome. On synthetic benchmarks it will perform *almost* as well as the infamous i7-990x which is a six core CPU and it costs $999!!! The i7-2600k comes with regular (and cheap IMO) cpu fan cooler, but it does the job, if you are not planning to overclock at the beginning just use the stock cpu fan. This processor is for enthusiast, hardcore computer builders, people who run virtual computers, and photo video editing. If you are a gamer only or planning to use the computer for regular basic stuff, please save some money and buy the i5-2500k instead. 90% of your computer needs will be pretty much the same with an 2500k which can be overclocked and it also has 4 cores (but no hyperthreading). You will save +$100 which can be put towards an SSD or a good video card.  Pros:  Super Fast  Quad Core  8 Threads with HyperThreading)  Easy to overclock, all I have to do with my asRock gen 3 mobo is to enable \\"auto overclock\\" to 4.4 ghz and thas it.  Temps with stock fan: 34c idle, 82c load using Intel Burn, NOT overclocked (coolmaster enforcer case, ambient temp: 80f-85f)  Temps with Corsair H60: 29c idle, 70c load, overclocked to 4.4 ghz  This CPU will most likely never be your \\"bottleneck\\".  Integrated Intel HD 3000 graphics will do an awesome work with your basic graphic needs.   Cons:  Might not be the most for your money. again 90% of people will be better with an i5-2500k  Cheap Fan, you need to buy an aftermarket cooler to overclock it.  Neutral:  VT-d was disabled from the K version, you dont know what is it? then you dont need it :)  Conclusion, you want to have the fastest computer, show off your friends, overclock, and money is not an issue? Get this processor. If you are in a budget, dont care about having a bigger \\"e-p3n1s\\", you game only, or basic stuff, get the i5-2500k
B003ZSJ212|1.0|You know Lucas can do whatever he wants to his movies. They are his creations. They are his artistic vision. Where he is wrong though is not including the original versions and remastering them for HI-def as an option. No other filmmaker has done what he has which is basically not acknowledging the existance of the original version. Yes these are his movies, but they also belong to us the fans because the fans support and love for these films made it the phenomena that it is. Sorry Mr. Lucas but I will not be ordering these. I'll stick to the laser discs.<br /><br />You know on second thought all these changes since the 1997 Special Editions til now have only made them consistent with the mediocrity of the Prequels. I always believed that the Original Trilogy existed in its own parallel universe separate from the six episode series anyway. Sort of a \\"Mirror Universe\\" version of Star Wars which is fine. The George Lucas of 2011 is certainly not the George Lucas of 1977. So these new versions of Star Wars should be called Star Wars : The Rise and Fall and Redemption of Anakin  Skywalker which is the way Lucas sees these films as nowadays. The Original Trilogy should exist as Star Wars : The Adventures of Luke Skywalker which I believe was the original conceptualization of the series. This if I remember correctly was used for the original novelizations of the trilogy.<br /><br />Darth Vader was always a much more interesting character when his origins were a mystery and only hinted at. This only enhanced his legend, mythology and aura which is why everybody loved this character in the first place. He was essentially a sci-fi version of the\\"boogie man\\" . The Original Trilogy made him the pop culture icon that he WAS. Unfortunately these special edition versions basically broke down Dart Vader into something a lot less. Lucas essentially made him into some gifted and whiny kid who was screaming out for help. This is fine if that is what Lucas wants of course. But as I said earlier give the fans the option of which version they want to see. There is no reason why they cant both exist. It is a big universe anyway.<br /><br />What I would like to see in an original trilogy Blu-ray set :<br /><br />Restored unaltered versions of the Trilogy with cleaned up effects and Original sound mixes as an option.<br />Deleted scenes<br />Original Making of documentaries.<br />Star Wars to Jedi Documentary<br />Empire of Dreams Documentary<br />Return of the Ewok Documentary (Restored and Remastered)<br />Star Wars Holiday Special (Restored and Remastered)<br />Vintage Interviews with cast and crew<br />Audio Commentaries<br />New documentary on the Star Wars Phenomena from a 1970's early 80's point of view which includes vintage toy commercials, actor and character appearances on such shows as Donnie and Marie, The Richard Pryor Show, The Muppet Show, etc. and interviews with illuminaries and fans of the period.<br />New documentary on the merchandising bonanza of the series.<br />Promotional art and trailers

B000002TQV|2.0|I got the bends listening to this album and had to spend a few hours in a sound less chamber in order to return to normal society.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|Since many reviewers have already covered many particular reasons to watch this show I will just put a summation:      This is a very well done comedy series with a good blend of short \\"easy\\" jokes and more tongue in cheek \\"witty\\" jokes.  That the show is another one with an ensemble of characters comprising 7 regular characters and a small stable of recurring secondary characters appeals to many folks because it helps dispell the character in a vaccum that one gets with many series.  The show also has the appeal of not necessarily knowing what every episode is going to be about as soon as the starting premise is over in that one can't necessarily see the first five minutes and know without doubt exactly what each character is going to do by the end.  The ability for the writers of Community to surprise me as well as amuse with anything from a smirk to laughing out loud is what makes this one of the only shows worth making an effort to see for me.      As far as this season is concerned as well as the forthcoming second season; that they are tv season dvds with 20+ well done episodes apiece both selling for $20 or less makes them an entertainment value that would be hard to find elsewhere.    edit: typo.
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|Cars 2 is a great movie. I enjoyed it more than the original. If you are a big Mater fan, then you will probably enjoy it because a lot of the comedy is centered on him. I am really surprised there are so many negative reviews of this movie. I am a huge animation fan, so maybe I am a little easier sell, but my boyfriend who almost never likes animated films laughed the whole time in the theater too.<br /><br />Plot: McQueen intends to relax with his pals from Cars 1. An Italian car smack-talks McQueen on a call-in show, so Mater calls in from the payphone to defend his friend. This results in McQueen competing in multiple races against the Italian car and multiple others. They are required to use a synthetic fuel in the races, but saboteurs start taking out the cars one by one which calls into question the safety of the synthetic fuel. Meanwhile Mater is mistaken for a secret agent and becomes actively involved in determining who the saboteurs are along with two real agents who think Mater's innocence is just a stupid act.<br /><br />I have never been a James Bond fan, so obviously you do not have to like James Bond to catch or enjoy the Cars 2 spoof. I think there is a good message in the movie about not underestimating others and their abilities. The climax is very clever, and I certainly did not anticipate who the \\"bad guy\\" was. It was also unique the way the bad guy was revealed.<br /><br />I cannot wait to buy this movie and watch it again!
B000051YEG|5.0|HOW TO GET HIGH (without drugs or alcohol): Just shut your eyes & listen to Serge Gainsbourg's Histoire de Melody Nelson...I was privilaged to hear the complete version at the Hollywood Bowl last Sunday (Aug. 28) -- a very lucky me! Gainsbourg's music is lush, beautiful, passionate, hypnotic, other worldly--in  two words: Purely wonderful! Can't get enough of his music now...on the other hand his subject matter is often less than to be desired....c'est la vie!
1582701709|4.0|With all the hype of this book and all the TV shows and radio shows the authors have been on, and then of course to get on Oprah, it's almost guaranteed to sell millions!  There is alot of interesting information in the book and it certainly is worth thinking about.  Wheather it changes your life or not I don't think is the point, it's more about being open to another way of thinking, which for some will cause better results in their lives.  My hat goes off to anyone who tries to bring something positive to the world.  I think it's great that this book has done and is still doing so well.  Wheather it's all true or not, it is putting out positive information that is bound to help alot of people feel better about themselves.
B0051MKMNC|5.0|Limitless is an entertaining ride through the ups and downs of a smart, but drug-addicted writer/loser (Bradley Cooper). Cooper is the one that makes the whole concept actually seem believable. His is simply awesome in this movie. The other characters are forgettable to me, not because they are terrible, but because Cooper takes the stage. I don't normally buy movies on the day they come out, but this is one of that I just had to have. One of this years best films. It is stylish, smart, and limitlessly entertaining.
0920668372|5.0|I first heard this book read when I was just a child in elementary school. The story stayed in my mind until I became an adult. I always wanted to purchase the book and read it to my children if I had any. After my first child was born I did just that. I still read this to both my children and at the end no matter how much I try to hold back I always cry.     This book is a perfect choice for those who have \\"active\\" children, best illustrated in this book, but also for anyone with any amount of love for a child.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I rarely write reviews, but I felt this was one was necessary! I bought it on a whim after seeing the video review posted on here. I currently own a Kelly Moore bag for day to day use. But when you're traveling or carrying extra equipment, having a bag strapped across your shoulder or chest is painful.<br /><br />I ended up LOVING it!<br /><br />The straps of the backpack are padded so it doesn't leave marks on your shoulder blades. The material doesn't make you itchy. Inside it's padded nicely so you don't need to worry about your equipment. It also has two extra zippers that you can use for personal things. I keep a book of choice, iPad and my medicine box in there. It also easily held my tourist maps, and misc. papers I picked up while traveling through Boston, MA. There's also two side holders, where you could put your cellphone (I rarely carry one, so I didn't test that out). I also enjoyed how easy it was to fix the straps. I'm only 5'0, so it's hard to get straps to adjust easily - however, I had no problem!<br /><br />To get an idea of what I carry in there: a d3100 Nikon Body usually attached with a 35mm, a Fujii Instax 210, 8 packs of film (it's big film too!), 2 lenses, my tripod (there's a side strap to be able to keep it on your bag), extra battery, Lens-Pen, extra SD card, my mother's Samsung point and shoot, and I squeeze a cardigan or my Northface parka in there.<br /><br />If you're a SLR user this is a must buy. The price is fantastic. The quality is durable. It held up in a New England rain storm! For the price they're selling it for you, you cannot physically get any better. When I compare this to the Lowepro backpack that I almost bought I feel so grateful for searching on here first. I can't wait to get more use of it. I'm most definitely 100% happy with this product.
0765324849|5.0|This book starts right at the idea of Rapture and follows through until the start of the first game. It's terrific for anyone who has played the games. It's spot on with them, even including recordings in the book that can be found in the game. It fills in the holes.<br /><br />If you have not played the original game yet and plan to, I'd hold off on reading this. It does give away certain surprises.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|Boycott this set!! Make george lucas release the originals or send a message  by telling him to stop altering these films. The 'Nooooooo! to the famous scene where Vader saves luke is just plain  dumb and silly.  He continues to ruin the films<br />we loved growing up and this is how he repays us by changing them, with cheesey dialouge and things that were fine in the first place.  I have no problem with special effects add ons, but<br />when you start adding dialouge, Enough is Enough.....
0553801473|5.0|This was a gift for my husband.  He found it very, ver good but you must read the 4 books that came in series before.
0307269752|2.0|Like many I wanted to like this book. I was confident it would be the thrilling, clever work of genius that it's been touted to be. Sadly it was not.<br /><br />`Dragon Tattoo' moves at a snail's pace and has a half dozen plus could-be interesting plotlines that lose steam and eventually sputter out into disjointed meaninglessness or are forgotten altogether.<br /><br />The main protagonist, one Mikael Blomkvist, is a man who alternates between being exasperatingly ignorant and mildly cunning. There are times in the book where you want to reach in and strangle him for not seeing what is right in front of his face and other times you want to shake his hand in congratulations for making a wise decision -- but the latter instances are few and far between.<br /><br />One may think this makes Blomkvist a model character, the everyman rather than some master detective genius type who seems to know and see all. Yet his tendency to make mistakes does not make him seem more human or realistic; it makes him seem like a clumsy idiot who makes unwise or downright ridiculous decisions that don't make sense for a character who is supposed to be a journalist well versed in investigation in his late forties.<br /><br />Blomkvist is not a good man. He neglects his daughter, cheated on his wife -- which lead to his divorce, one that he doesn't seem to have any feelings about -- has been carrying on a decades-long affair with a married woman (whose husband is forward thinking and modern enough to be ok with that, apparently -- who also happens to be his business partner -- and strikes up several other affairs with women he would have done better to abstain from. But alas, the women are persistent. Larsson makes sure the women always initiate and leave Blomkvist with no room to resist.<br /><br />His sexual prowess and numerous physical encounters with various women for seemingly no reason at all are a main theme in the book and recurring issue that is never addressed. Blomkvist engages in sexual relationships that are detached and pointless and read more like an older man's erotic fantasy than a realistic depiction of a character's exploits. While his own sex scenes are not very descriptive or remotely pornographic, they are numerous. I'm somewhat lead to believe that Larsson took it upon himself to use this book as a vehicle to not only tell a fictional story, but also of his own fantasies and/or actual sexual exploits.<br /><br />He is all about ethics in his work and in journalism in general but cares not for having such high standards in his personal life. For a paltry sum of about $350,000 USD he agrees to cover up the atrocious secrets he uncovers about the Vanger Clan but excuses this glaring ethical violation by claiming that he's come to know the family too well and doesn't want to upset one of his favorite members. A flimsy excuse indeed.<br /><br />And then we have one \\"Fr&ouml;ken\\" Lisbeth Salander who is the eponymous `Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' and who is given but a fraction of the plot time one would expect. She is smart in some instances but shows severely arrested development in others. She's violent sometimes without reason -- and often without credibility -- and has a special set of skills that border on absolute superhero-like dexterity. She possesses a photographic memory which -- in the vein of the `Reluctant Hero' -- she considers more a less a curse that makes her a freak, even though she makes a good living off of it.<br /><br />But if Mikael Blomkvist is supposed to be realistic, at 5'0 and 90lbs, Lisbeth Salander is a walking talking Deus ex machina, always at hand with an answer or to save the day. It us utterly inconceivable that she would be able to do half of the damage she is either shown or said to have done, even with low-level weaponry at hand. She is not only fierce and strong willed, but whip-smart, extraordinarily tech savvy, rides a motorcycle is skilled in the art of elaborate disguise, foreign accents,is multi-lingual and is willing to engage in open sexual relationships with many people -- not all of them men -- that for the most part remain purely physical without any emotional attachment on her part.<br /><br /> She is an outcast, but only because she makes herself so for reasons we are never told. She's sullen, taciturn (a word Larsson himself uses several times to describe her) and often downright rude and still she has dozens of `friends' and associates in an intercontinental network willing to break various laws and international treaties at her disposal. She is the ultimate badass whose character teeters perilously close to supernatural incredulity. She is more a caricature than a character, acting out one revenge fantasy after another. She is part male fancy, part superhero to a point that beggars belief.<br /><br />However, though flawed and oftentimes unlikable, I still rooted for her character and found myself sympathizing with throughout. But Stieg Larsson wasn't having that. In the span of close nearly 600 pages, Larsson made sure that she suffered a multitude of atrocities and degradation from neglect to molestation to battery to kidnapping culminating in violent sexual assault and sadism that included sodomy and foreign objects. Then it finally ends -- almost as if to pour salt on the wound -- in heartbreak, all at the hands of those who are supposed to have her best interest at heart. And naturally, the few people with whom she is even remotely close to either disappoint her or die.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Blomkvist's verisimilitude, and Salander's extraordinary abilities combined cannot make this book worth the mental strain it takes to sift through page upon page of mind-numbingly dull dialogue and descriptions of Blomkvist drinking coffee (which he does ever so often), eating sandwiches and having sex (furious sex, on the work desk no less) that lead to a listless if not premature climax.<br /><br />But my main gripe isn't even with the ham-handled handling of the climax or the several instances of dialogue that are really little more than exposition. The real issue comes from the long, drawn-out passages regarding financial crime and Hans-Erik Wernnerstr&ouml;m -- a man we're obviously supposed to hate but aren't given solid reasons why -- who set his sights on a tiny little financial magazine with a maximum circulation of about 23,000 people. Wernnerstr&ouml;m is corrupt yes, and towards the end we are quickly told that he has dealings with Russian mobsters, arms dealing and -- just so we're sure he's a very bad man -- prostitution. Of course, what with all the horrible men in this book it's quite hard to hate Wernnerstr&ouml;m on the level we're clearly expected to. He never speaks, never appears and is never in direct confrontation with Blomkvist which, if bizarre at the beginning of the book, became a farce at the end.<br />In today's world, a story about a gangster financier and a multi-million dollar criminal enterprise might have been interesting. A story about a missing, wealthy and sheltered girl who vanished without a trace some forty plus years ago may hold some appeal, but combined, these two things do not a good story make.<br /><br />I'd like to add, a bit about the clumsy Swedish to English translation. While the book isn't bogged down with translation errors, the translators choice of using terms like 'Herr' and 'Froken' rather than Mister or Miss become an annoyance that frequently reminds the reader that they are indeed reading a translated work. Also, be aware that this is a translation from Swedish to British English and as an American reader, prepare yourself for some terms like 'lift' for elevator, flat as opposed to apartment and unfamiliar spellings of simple words like 'tyre' and 'gaol' for tire and jail.lationships with many people -- not all of them men -- that for the most part remain purely physical without any emotional attachment on her part.

0143113100|3.0|Each chapter focuses on the story of a different individual or disorder, and throughout the short vignettes provide some background science and new discoveries in the particular field.<br /><br />I thought the book varied in strength greatly between chapters. Some chapters were excellently supported by scientific findings and new developments, while others...weren't.<br /><br />I also thought, as a current student in the neurosciences, that Dr. Doidge overemphasizes the 'novelty' and 'anti-establishment' aspects of neuroplasticity. The fact of the matter is that most of what Dr. Doidge talks about is currently the standard understanding.<br /><br />For example, he makes a great deal contrasting those who believe certain brain areas only perform certain cognitive functions and those who believe in the plastic brain's ability to adapt almost any area to any task. However, the distinction is more or less moot nowadays, with most neuroscientists both acknowledging that certain areas usually specially for certain tasks *and* that under special circumstances or training they can adapt to other tasks.<br /><br />I would recommend this book more for the non-expert, as I think it will change the layperson's understanding of their own mind's ability for change. However, it might not be quite as interesting or as insightful for those already familiar with brain science.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|well beyond excited about the blurays the closer I get the more I worry did he screw empire is their anything left to be excited for. THe Noooo is just that it is the single dumbest change in the history of star wars. It makes no sense and what every bullhockey they shove Im not buying its a pure waste of time.Someone actually thought this was a good idea fire that idiot oh maybe it was george ok fire him. Oh by the way in lucas divorce it was noted that his wife would be entitled to profits from the sale of the original films on vhs bluray dvd etc.. So george released the original cuts as bonus features in order not to owe her the money therefore until his wife dies I guess we will never get the original films in their original form. But I dont have a problem with light changes or cleaning up the print or different scenary issues when you start changing dialogue and the context of the scene then you change the whole meaning of the character and the scene and because you know the original all you do is compare it to the way it should have stayed. Greedo,Noooo,shaw changing to hayden fix it send a replacment disc for jedi and make the fans happy. I dont know if I will still buy it due to I got it for over 50 percent off so it was really cheap preorder if I find out that empire has changed then Im cancelling for sure. He doesnt care what the fans think and hes going to do whatever he wants whether you like it or not the only choice we have as fans is to either give him your money and deal with it or say scrw you lucas and watch the original or special edition on dvd and enjoy them for what they mean to you and hope that someday you will be able to have them on a high quality version because someone at lucasfilm actually cared about what the fans thought. Lucas may have to be dead for it to happen but I guess we can wait.
B005COO1X6|4.0|King at his popcorn best: great characters well-built, a monster that isn't overly explained (who's complaining?  not me), tension, a great setting, great kids.  The one thing I would have like was a *little* more denouement, but I think I was fooled by the novel segment at the end into expecting more, and thus found the ending kind of abrupt.
B0050QV0RQ|4.0|Last night I woke up at 2am and pulled out my phone, two hours of SoE later I decided to crash after a boss battle.  Well I rushed head-first into it and my party wiped.  Then I realized that there's no automatic save...  I realized I had to do those two hours over again.  And that's when I realized I WAS going to replay those two hours, and that's what compelled me to write this review.  With this new glut of free apps and micro-transactions, finding something like this that you won't just toss aside at the first inconvenience is rare.      If you loved 8-bit RPGs and want to relive that in a slightly more modern fashion this is the game for you.  A great throwback to old rpgs, but with some modern touches in the UI and game play to really smooth things out.      Slight cons: I have a Droid X and no hard keyboard, and I can't use these on screen controls worth a damn, so I'm always rocking my finger back and forth trying to see what, exactly, the text box under it says.  Also moving around is a pain.  There are three different control alternatives which is an amazing feature, ultimately, the problem here is just my lack of a physical keyboard.    NO AUTO SAVE  =)    The game dialogue was originally created in Japanese and the translations are rough, 99% of the dialogue gets its point across, but you'll be rolling your eyes at some of the dialogue.      Some of the displays in the fight screens took some exploration into the help menus to see just what values exactly they were representing and HOW they were representing it.  (the speed bar and the break meter in my case).    Quick pro: This game seems to give users a plethora of ways to tune and tweak your characters.  You can reassign skill points at ANY time, subtracting and assigning to whatever areas you want.  And different 'tomes' (a way of assigning classes to your characters, they inherit skills) mean you can make the characters any type you prefer.  Change the lead guy into a mage, or the golem from a powerhouse to a guardian, to soak up damage.  The custom-ability is incredible.    This has been on sale for $3 for almost a month, and for that price I strongly recommend picking it up.  You are able to save anywhere at almost any time (not certain about during fights), so being able to play for two minutes and stop without losing your progress is great.  At the full price I'd only recommend people who know exactly the type of game they're purchasing pick this up.  Eight bucks isn't just something to gamble on, but if you know what you're picking up, this is a great mobile game.  Just remember to save your game, OFTEN!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Preorder for Complete Saga placed on January 7, 2011.  Preorder for Complete Saga canceled on August 31, 2011.    Thank goodness the abominable changes (a few of them linked to with youtube clips below) leaked far enough in advance for people to cancel their preorders. I didn't really need the Blu-Ray additions, but I preordered anyway to get HD Star Wars..........however, I REFUSE to shell out $90 (original price of $140?!?!?!) to watch the most powerful scene in the entire saga be turned into a farce. Hayden's mug at the end of Jedi in 2004 was bad enough. This is the final straw.    A lifelong Star Wars fan has officially canceled his preorder and urges everyone else to do the same ---- please don't waste money on supporting these terrible changes. $90 can be spent so much better.......     .....in addition to all of the past foolish changes (e.g. Hayden Christensen in Return of the Jedi, completely replacing Sebastian Shaw!!), here is what pushed this huge Star wars fan over the edge(replace the 'h**p' with 'http' to go to the youtube links):    [...]    [...]    <\beginrant>    The Noooooooo addition isn't as hammy as the Noooooo at the end of Revenge of the Sith....BUT......they added this completely unnecessary and distracting dialogue in the middle of what was a PERFECT scene and the climax of the entire saga.  With this change, all of the subtle internal conflict and suspense is lost and the scene is dumbed down to three-year-old level, completely ruining the tension and deflating ultimate surprise when Vader grabs the Emperor and heaves him over the edge.    This is one of the most iconic scenes in all of cinema for a reason......it was perfect.....to mess with it AT ALL deserves the harshest of criticism from one's fanbase and colleagues alike.    The fact that these changes split the fanbase in two (those that don't mind it vs. those that hate it) is reason enough for them not to be made. The originals were brilliant, flaws and all. Just give us the remastered, upscaled transfers of the original prints and retire forever, George....I want a good-looking (high-quality transfer) of the versions I fell in love with. NOT versions with substantial and distracting edits to the score, the pacing, the dialogue, the sound effects etc.    Yes, it is Lucas' baby to play with. It is also my money (and yours) to give to him or not. Some may not agree with me, but these changes are dealbreakers (especially the one made to the climax of the whole saga) at the current price --- I understand that some people can still appreciate the movies to the fullest even with these changes --- that's great and best wishes w/ the Blu_ray transfers. Unfortunately, I don't fall into that camp and I'd like to encourage as many people as possible to NOT support Lucas' latest revisions by cancelling their preorders and only buying this later on at a nice discount.     What is really terrible is that I just watched the REAL, ORIGINAL version of the climactic scene in Return of the Jedi where Vader picks up the Emperor ----- I started to again get emotionally vested in the scene, but at the key moment that is usually emotionally overwhelming , my emotion was tempered because I was hearing the \\"No.........NOOOOOOO!!!!\\" in my head even though the dialogue wasn't in the version I was watching.    Lucas has tainted that scene in my mind forever........I wish I had never even heard that new dialogue! I hope that this is just because it is fresh in my mind and that in the coming years, I can forget that I ever even heard new dialogue in that scene and can go back to fully appreciating the scene in its true form, brimming with power and emotion.....     I urge you all to BOYCOTT this release and pick this up second-hand or at a very significant discount in a few months when it turns out that they have a massive overstock because the fans finally decided to spit out George's slop.    <\endrant>
0439023521|5.0|This was my first purchase on my Kindle app.  I selected it because it was by far the best selling title on Kindle.  I was worried at first it would be a teenie bopper type book based on the description and some of the reader reviews.  However, it turned out to be an exciting page turner.  'm looking forward to the next two in the trilogy.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Told from 5 year old Jack's point of view, the story is incredible and completely heartwrenching to see how this little boy understands (or doesn't understand) his world.  I couldn't put it down.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I would highly recommend not purchasing this garbage. Lucas destroyed these movies years ago and somehow continues to destroy them to this day. New changes and a sharper picture, it must be better, right?
B004MMEIK0|3.0|I liked the story but the over use of the phrase \\"God's Blood\\" was sickening.  I would think that even a vampire could come up with something different to say from time to time.

0316017930|3.0|Basically, the book is a tome of anecdotes that explain how people become 'outliers', i.e., successful persons in business, arts, science, etc. At times, it's entertaining to peek 'behind the curtain' on certain famous people and see how they became the successful people that they are. However, the book contains little practical advice for an individual seeking outlier status. In a nutshell, luck and hard work will determine whether a person makes it to the rarefied air. I would wager that for every 1 out of 1,000 hard working people, luck will smile upon this person with outlier status. This book helps me understand a little bit on how and why outliers happen, and as such it was an entertaining read.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|A must case to have for iphone 4! Fits perfectly, feels like a hard case, easy to slip on. Doesn't make the phone bulky at all. Would recommend to a friend!
0316010669|4.0|It was an interesting read, and anecdote laden at that. It has given me food for thought on how I rapidly view my world on a minute to minute basis, all on a subconscious level. Basically, 'thin-slicing' is a tremendous skill set a person can have in navigating the minefield we call Ordinary Life, i.e., our jobs, our family, our friends, our connections to the world. I am also appreciative of the fact that the author has also highlighted hidden dangers and negative costs for thin-slicing, such as 'temporary autism'. Sometimes, there's just no substitute for experienced judgement that only builds in a person after decades of wisdom, expertise, and just plain creative savvy. Overall, a recommended read.
B002ZCDR88|5.0|I first became aware of this album through a review in Rolling Stone, but not really being familiar with Natalie Merchant, I didn't pay it much attention. I recently came across it in my public library, brought it home, ripped it to the hard drive, and began listening to it. I feel sorry for the long time Merchant fans who think they know what she's \\"supposed\\" to produce. It prevents them from appreciating this for what it is. This is a concept album, and it's a true work of art. Read the other reviews here for details, but it's absolutely delightful. I mean that literally: I experience delight every time I listen to it. So much so that I went to Amazon and ordered myself a copy so that I will always have it available, even if the hard drive crashes, along with the 80 page booklet with stories about the various authors of the lyrics. I love all kinds of music, and collect it avidly, but this is my favorite music acquisition this year.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Quite simply comparing to the previous release, out of the five major changes, 4 are really dumb, and one is meh. Really really dumb!
B004QDCZ3M|5.0|Florence + The Machine is an awesome new British import, and absolutely worth the listen!  It's definitely a bit off-the-wall, but if you like quirky, this band is right up your ally.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|I was using the free version for a while. The ads in the free version were really unobtrusive. However, I bought the full version to support the dev. Great job on the app.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Mumford & Sons is a band I'd checked out following a review that listed them as one of the top 10 new British imports, and I'm SO glad I did!  Their sound is somewhat Celtic and folksy, but the entire album is a great listen, and there's not a song on it that I want to skip past.  Awesome!
B00005JMFQ|5.0|One of my favorite movies.  Its a real feel good movie especially during the holidays.  This all star cast works well together and really make you laugh and cry!
B005COO1X6|5.0|You'll probably hear this a lot in the coming days and throughout what's bound to be a long list of reviews, but I'm going to say it anyway because it's the truest thing I can think to say: MILE 81 is classic Stephen King.<br /><br />With only a few exceptions, most of King's more recent work (everything since NEEDFUL THINGS really) has been more mysterious, paranormal, or suspenseful than horrific. There's nothing wrong with that, of course, and I've enjoyed most of what King's written from CARRIE all the way through FULL DARK, NO STARS, but MILE 81 is a welcome return to a purer kind of horror for those readers who fell in love with King back in the CUJO, CHRISTINE, and IT days. I'll save the plot rehashing for other reviewers, but I will say that I think this novelette is what King might have written if he'd gotten the idea for FROM A BUICK 8  25 years earlier.<br /><br />It's a fantastic story. One of my favorite King stories of all time. And maybe that's all I really needed to say. If you're debating whether or not to buy this, stop. Go click that 1-Click button as fast as  your fingers can move.<br /><br />**Note: Although the novella earns a solid 5 stars from me (I'd give it ten if I could), the formatting could have used some more attention. There are missing section breaks, and the dedication--which should have been on a page of its own--comes immediately after the last line of the story. Somebody needs a slap on the wrist for that one. Or a kick in the teeth.<br /><br />Also, MILE 81 ends at the 80% mark. What you get after that is a long excerpt from 11/22/63. That's just a heads-up for readers who like to know how close they are to the end of a story.<br /><br />I'm not taking anything off my rating for those things, but I thought some of you might like to know.
B0025UHKNS|2.0|I've had this item for several months.  It's features are pretty basic, but functional.  All except for one major flaw.  If you wear anything other than cotton when you exercise, don't buy this unit.  Just the slightest static from synthetic clothing or wool will cause your heart rate readings to spike all over the place.  Since every cyclist wears synthetic fabrics almost exclusively, this is a major design flaw.  Garmin has known about this issue for years, and has yet to address it other than to say wear cotton or wet your shirt (not exactly an option when cycling on cold mornings). Their lack of attention to this flaw in all their monitors shows how little Garmin listens to their customers.  Look elsewhere.  For this kind of money, there are better options.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I was very excited to see that Star Wars films were coming to Blu-Ray. I have decided to cancel my order, and not get them anywhere else, because George Lucas continues to ruin these films by adding new and unnecessary story-changing additions to the dialogue and special effects. Star Wars, goodbye forever.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Art is a distinctly human endeavor. We must have respect for it if we are to have any respect for the human race.  These current defacements are just the beginning. Today, engineers with their computers can add color to black-and-white movies, change the soundtrack, speed up the pace, and add or subtract material to the philosophical tastes of the copyright holder. Tommorrow, more advanced technology will be able to replace actors with \\"fresher faces,\\" or alter dialogue and change the movement of the actor's lips to match. It will soon be possible to create a new \\"original\\" negative with whatever changes or alterations the copyright holder of the moment desires. The copyright holders, so far, have not been completely diligent in preserving the original negatives of films they control. In order to reconstruct old negatives, many archivists have had to go to Eastern bloc countries where American films have been better preserved.  In the future it will become even easier for old negatives to become lost and be \\"replaced\\" by new altered negatives. This would be a great loss to our society. Our cultural history must not be allowed to be rewritten.

B005JE7WKI|5.0|In this topsy turvy comedy/horror romp, I guess the above question is a matter of point of view. If you watch the movie you will get what I mean.    When fun-loving, hardworking Tucker and Dale put all of their money into buying a new vacation home in the middle of the woods (token cabin in the woods).  They think everything is going to be on an up swing, that's until a group of \\"college kids\\" (or teen camper slasher victims as we are used to) decide they too need a get away.    When they cross paths with each other the college kids get all nervous and freak out, because as we all know ALL hillbillies are psychos (right?).  This is where the fun begins as a bunch of common misunderstandsings turn hilariously deadly in this fun little film. Misunderstandings that is with chainsaws, woodchippers, spears, scythes, and not to mention guns, this may be the film for you.    The acting is great, the story is very well done and executed.  If you are a fan of say the Evil Dead 2, Drag Me To Hell, Doghouse, or even Shaun of the Dead (which I hated beyond words) give this movie a shot. It will definately surprise you and may even earn a good spot on your shelf, I know I have a space reserved.    To note the gore isn't as over the top as the laughs, but there is definately enough of that to go around for a horror/comedy.
B004SIP6LS|3.0|I've worked retail for several years, so I can certainly sympathize with the plight of these two convenience store clerks.  If the customer's not entirely brain-dead, he's so demanding that absolutely nothing can be done to make him happy.  The story seems to wander and meander at times, especially concerning the clerks' private lives, and there are scenes that appear to have been written haphazardly just to get them in the film, but the encounters with the various customers - all realistic, by the way - makes this film a good watch.
0316056863|5.0|I've bought a lot of books lately, so I decided to check this out from the library.  I figured it would be a light, frothy piece that didn't really matter so why would I want to own it?  First sign: I was 179th on the waiting list.  When I finally got the book, I found out how WRONG my guess about it had been.  Loved it so much I'm going to buy it now plus copies for all my family and friends.  Honestly, this is a book I will read again and again.  It's Tina Fey in ink, pocket-sized, always available for a laugh and surprising nuggets of wisdom.  Tina Fey is not only humorous, she's dedicated, determined, impossibly hard-working, all while maintaining a crazy-funny outlook.  The book is intimate even as it covers a wide range of emotions and experiences.  You'll read about her childhood, her much-loved father, her difficult high school and college experiences with boys, her early jobs, her work with Second City in Chicago, her honeymoon cruise, her interview for the SNL job, her admiration for Amy Poehler, her love for her daughter Alice, and much more.  The pages on improv technique are priceless.  Her observations of Alec Baldwin's acting abilities are great.  Her recounting of the Sarah Palin episode are incomparable.  She is not afraid to show herself at her worst as she does with the unfortunate pre-college episode which reveals she hadn't accepted her homosexual friends as completely as she'd thought.  She shares her pain and her growth.  There's a lot more Tina Fey in this book than you ever get to see on the screen.  I liked her already, now my respect and affection for her are immensely greater.  This is a book I will continue to enjoy for a long time.

The 2 lead characters in this legal drama are captivating and have fantastic rival energy going on between them. Once you watch senior partner, Harvey Specter and his young associate/apprentice, Mike Ross, in action, you'll recognize that this brilliantly written legal drama is a show you'll want to watch every week. Kudos to USA Network for renewing this show for a 2nd season!
B001KZI2WW|5.0|amazing set of shoes for almost anything. took em to the beach and the fact that its only the shoe itself and the big rubber sole makes cleaning them a breeze.  the comfort level will honestly surprise you, or u can keep reading other reviews if your not convinced. great as a second pair of shoes if u dont feel like putting your dress shoes or boots from work back on, simply to run to the bank/store/anywhere etc. i dont like the look of the other croc slippers, but these arent your average crocs and this is why im buying another pair.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|I think George must be smoking too many lightsabers as it seems his mind is floating about somewhere in a galaxy far, far away.  He has a right to change his movies.  Sure he does!  He has a right to burn in hell but I don't want to follow him there.  Some of the original changes made for the SE were at least tolerable and at least one change made sense, like the voice of the actor who spoke for Boba Fett in The Empire Strikes Back was replaced with the voice of the actor who played Jango Fett in the prequels; but it's getting out of hand with this new release.  What would it look like if some nut went back and put digital alterations on the Wizard of Oz or The Sound of Music?

B004RSCWZ2|3.0|I don't think the question, as put by some critics of the CD, is how do you make such a large band work in today's industry, but rather how do you showcase so much outstanding musicianship on one recording.  And this becomes the chief problem for Revelator.  While Tedeschi's vocals are prominently featured throughout, Mike Mattison's superb raspy voice sadly is not.  While there are occasional flashes of Derek's brilliant guitar, he mostly stays in his lane.  Fans of DTB's musical diversity and exoticism, complete with Kofi Burbridge's beautiful flute and Yonrico Scott's towering drums, may be disappointed.  DTB's explosive fusion is decidedly not part of this CD.  That being said, TTB is not DTB.  And this CD should be heard for the simple fact of its great catchy song writing.  Standouts are \\"Don't Let Me Slide,\\" \\"Simple Things,\\" \\"Ball and Chain,\\" and \\"Shelter.\\"  \\"Midnight in Harlem\\" is one of the most beautifully evocative ballads written in a long time.  There's something about the music throughout the CD that is unassuming but tantalizing.  The more you listen, the further you're drawn into the melodies, harmonies, rhythms, and choruses.  The prime components are there and they all please, not totally unexpected given the musical talent behind the songs. I would hope for greater showcasing of those individual talents in the future.  3.5 stars.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I give up.  I found the original theatrical releases in a Fan-Edit online, downloaded those and am now happy as a clam.  I refuse to let Lucas screw with my childhood memories anymore.
0451450523|2.0|The Last Unicorn by Peter S. Beagle arrived on my doorstep a couple of weeks ago. I was mean and keen to start reading this book, as Patrick Rothfuss (author of The Name of the Wind) is forever raging about its well-written beauty and lyrical genius. Okay, Patrick... you got me. Haha.<br /><br />The Last Unicorn is a fantasy tale with no surprises in store. The story is about a lowly unicorn who sets out to discover what has happened to the rest of her kind. Along the way she collects a practicing magician and an elderly cook. Then she marches upon a castle and an evil king - the rest you could probably guess. The Last Unicorn is more of an elaborated upon fairy-tale than an actual story. If you enjoy fairy-tales, you probably won't enjoy this book.<br /><br />The pace of the story is often confusing. Parts of the tale seem to linger longer in areas that I deemed unnecessary, but sped through scenes that I thought were crucial and important. I couldn't quite get my head about it. The characters were... well, bland. I didn't feel much empathy for any of the characters, really. They were just stoic pieces to be moved around as the story progressed. When something happened to a character, I hardly cared. This may sound dismissive and pompous, but I'm sure everyone has had this experience before.<br /><br />The world is much like our own with a few more details added. Beagle does well in describing the surroundings, but after a while it just got tiring.<br /><br />The story is short and in its defence, does well in evoking emotions in its lyrical songs and poems. I can definitely see where Patrick Rothfuss drew inspiration from. The story the legend of someone or something always shadows the reality of the thing itself. It's an interesting concept and those familiar with Rothfuss' work will know where I'm coming from.<br /><br />I was disappointed by this book. But I attribute that to how much Rothfuss talked it up. Approach the book for what it is: a simple fantasy story with a convoluted message.<br /><br />Patrick.<br /><br />- - -<br /><br />Story: 5/10<br />Characters: 4/10<br />World: 4/10<br />Impression: 4/10<br />OVERALL: 4/10<br /><br />[...]k.    - - -    Story: 5/10  Characters: 4/10  World: 4/10  Impression: 4/10  OVERALL: 4/10     [...]

0756404738|5.0|\\"There are three things all wise men fear: the sea in the storm, a night with no moon, and the anger of a gentle man.\\"<br /><br />Indeed, all wise men do fear these things. But they should also fear one more thing: the sheer size of this book. Patrick Rothfuss' The Wise Man's Fear is a 1000-page monstrosity that could have attributed to my chronic back pain and occasional muscle spasms. Lugging this book around, I hardly had room enough for essentials, often choosing to leave university books at home. This book, of course, took preference.<br /><br />The Wise Man's Fear is the second book in the Kingkiller Chronicle, a sequel to the hugely popular The Name of the Wind. It continues the story of Kvothe, a man of legend in hiding. Kvothe tells his story over three days - the real story and not the legend people have fabricated over the years. This book is day two of his story-telling, and there is no lack of story to be told.<br /><br />I was very excited about reading this book. However, around 100 pages in, I knew I couldn't experience the story at its full potential, lest I re-read The Name of the Wind. Patrick Rothfuss continues the story with an assumption that his readers know and remember all the finer details from book one. I wasn't too fussed, but I can see how it might be an issue for someone who simply doesn't want to go back and re-read 700 pages. I found that I actually enjoyed going back, once again immersing myself in to the world, the characters, the stories and the plot in general. By the time I had finished book one, I was ready to pick up book two.<br /><br />The characters are brilliant; the writing is brilliant; the stories are brilliant; the atmosphere... brilliant. The only thing I question is the length of the book and the overall plot. It seemed a little scattered. There was no true direction, and Rothfuss seems to have written about anything that came to mind (within reason). Don't get me wrong, it's all fascinating, but it's a bit jarring at times. However, I nit-pick. The Wise Man's Fear is a wonderful book if you take it for what it is: a good, long story. You'll feel right at home again with the characters and feel genuine emotions toward them. The little stories told throughout the book are funny and exciting.<br /><br />Put a few months aside if you've yet to read these books, because you'll become absolutely engrossed in the story. The Wise Man's Fear wasn't as near as good as The Name of the Wind, but it was still a very satisfying read.<br /><br />Characters - 10/10<br />Plot - 7/10<br />World - 9/10<br />Writing - 10/10<br />Re-Readability - 8/10<br /><br />Check out my website in my profile for more fantasy reviews and updates!Wise Man's Fear is a wonderful book if you take it for what it is: a good, long story.

B00521B9B6|5.0|I bought this for my daughter - for ONE song - Pumped Up Kicks.  I had read reviews and sampled the tracks before I bought & liked what I heard.  I'd rate the CD PG-13 as most songs have lyrics the even 13 year old kids - tho they already know about the subjects - shouldn't.    Over all - I like all of the songs - no favorite    \\"LOVE\\" on the CD we bought -is a BONUS track - about a \\"Cougar\\" named \\"Sara(h)\\" - again - not something 13 yr old's \\"should know about\\" - but, we like the name of the \\"Cougar\\".    I am happy to know that music my daughter likes - is also something I can enjoy!
B004LWZVZC|4.0|All I ever really knew about Lincoln's assassination was where it happened, who did it, and what happened to the assassin.  So I found THE CONSPIRATOR informative and intriguing.<br />Producer/director Robert Redford has crafted a handsomely made film, rich in sepia-toned colors and authentic detail.  Its depiction of a nation in panic after a devastating Civil War could easily parallel post-911 America.<br />James Simpson's script is non-compromising and non-judgmental, leaving the viewer to decide if Mary Surratt is innocent or guilty.  The issue of judicial equity is seriously addressed in the fairness of denying Surratt to have a trial by jury or testifying in her own defense.<br />Redford elicits strong performances from his cast, especially James McAvoy's layered portrait of the idealistic lawyer who fights arduously for a client he believes may be guilty.  Robin Wright demonstrates an unexpected maturity as Mary, a devoted mother whose reticence to implicate her son ultimately her downfall.  Strong support also comes from a nearly unrecognizable Kevin Kline, Tom Wilkinson, Evan Rachel Wood, Colm Meaney, and Alexis Bladel.<br />Although sometimes pondering and slow, THE CONSPIRATOR is an impressive view of our nation in one of its darkest moments.
B003Q6D282|1.0|I am a big fan of the SAW series but this was the most embarrassing installment BY FAR! The pink blood completely destroyed the gore factor and the cinematography (camera style & filming) absolutely destroyed the film. Not to mention the mediocre acting from some of the lead roles. Right from the beginning  I thought that the first kill was a hoax/gag by someone mocking \\"Jigsaw\\" in the movie. But come to find out it was actually suppose to be real! The body being decapitated looked so fake compared to even the first two films which had the lowest budget to work with. I'm not sure if the director was trying to do something unique or different because it sure was disappointing to end the SAW Series like this. The only positive note is that all loose ends were tied up in the film without being to far-fetched. Kudos only go to the scriptwriting for this film. If John Kramer were alive he'd capture the director, Kevin Greutert, and set him in a \\"Jigsaw\\" game.
159448385X|5.0|Khaled Hosseini's Kite Runner was a brilliant, melancholic tale, at times sad and shocking, but infused with sections of uncanny inspiration. With that book, he demonstrated perfectly how to capture the spirit of a country's era through gripping storytelling and wonderful, human characters. Notwithstanding it's great story, I always felt a particular suspension of disbelief when reading it.     I feel the characters in A Thousand Splendid Suns are far more personal and believable. I admire highly Hosseini's seemingly simple and plain methods of storytelling, incorporated with poetic imagery and insights. In telling his character's stories, he neither exaggerates nor underplays their tragic circumstances for mere show of skill or simply for entertainment, but tells everything as is, or rather how it would be in reality. As a result, the story is told honestly and the characters seem to be actual persons who are merely the victims of a destiny filled with cruel circumstances and harshness; but also with lessons of true friendship, virtue, and hope amongst the most trying events.     In this manner, the reader feels as the characters feel, cries when they cry, and laughs with them when they triumph, because it's as if you are a useless witness peering into their various accounts. Unable to help them, you may only watch as they are hurled into such hardships as would move compassion in the hardest souls. Yet you witness as they endure their circumstances with such hope that reminds you of the important women in your life. How strong and brave, and courageous these frail women are. You will feel as if you'd like to give them your heart and show them a life without such hardships. It was not only the earnest hope and close kinship formed between Mariam and Laila that brought me to tears, but their lost felicity of a beautiful country and a simple way of life. It reminds you to embrace the simple joys of safety and well-being.    With such heartfelt characters, Hosseini educates and elucidates the feeling of living in a country amidst so much war and conflict. And as it is told through the point of view of women, it divulges the characters' feelings through arranged marriages and various restrictions placed upon them. Perhaps they are so believable because as a reader, you witness their growth from small little girls, starry-eyed and ignorant of the true harshness of their country, to being thrown into womanhood at very early ages and going through their struggles with so little experience.     Towards the end of this book, you'll have a deeper, more heartfelt point of view and opinion of the women of Afghanistan and the Middle East. Amongst so much war and so little civility in their country, they have been the victims who have had no one to complain to and no voice that would be heard. This heartfelt book, its narrative beautiful of itself, is one such voice in enlightening the struggles of so many brave women.
1423389387|4.0|Rothfuss's first book, \\"The Name of the Wind\\" is an amazing addition to epic fantasy, which has gained well-deserved cult status. This book covers Day 1 of the hero Kvothe the Bloodless's life. \\"The Wise Man's Fear\\" covers Day 2. Anyone who considers beginning with this book is making a serious mistake, because you're really not going to know what's going on and you'll be doing yourself and the author quite a disservice.    My honest feeling is that \\"The Name of the Wind\\" is a far stronger book than the second volume; however, \\"The Wise Man's Fear\\" appears to be intended to build up to a climax in the third book.     So, you have a choice.  The reader's going to have a lot of unanswered questions and unfinished business. If you're not into a lot of ambiguity, what I'd suggest is wait til the third book is within a hair's breadth of release and read \\"The Wise Man's Fear,\\" then follow it straightaway with the sequel. On the other hand, if you are pining for more Kvothe, grab this book and read to your heart's content. It's beautifully written, the stories are rich, and you'll have a lot of material to whet your appetite.     The audiobook is an excellent addition to the story. The narrator does a splendid job of creating the characters and keeping you listening. Now, the unabridged version does take more than the length of the \\"day\\" in the book to be read aloud. Be warned, this audio is 43 hours long. It's still well worth the listen if you're patient and have the time.     Rebecca Kyle, September 2011
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I've been a SW fan for over 30 years now. I was first exposed to this fantastic franchise in its original form. Lucas, a long time ago in a decade far far away was a visionary. Now he's insane, plain and simple. The man has lost it. This addition of Vader's double \\"No\\" at the end of RotJ is the last straw. I could live with most of the rest of the stuff, because it was mostly superficial. But this...this changes the most pivital moment in the series. This is supposed to be Vader's redemption, and now it's ruined.     Don't buy this.     Show your protest by not purchasing something impure like this collection. Let it be known that you will withold your money until this is put right.     If the discs don't sell, then they will have to redo it. Make it hurt where it counts the most...in the bank account.     Don't be sheep. Don't buy this just because it's new and it's blu-ray. Stand your ground and show that you, the fanbase, the consumers will not be manipulated into buying an inferior product just because it is shiny and new.
B0058A119G|5.0|Barbra has always performed best when she believes in what she sings. This is why her songs with lyrics by her long time friends Alan and Marilyn Bergman ring so true and deep with feeling. It is no surprise that she has been drawn to her friends' songs since the late sixties. She owes them this tribute because it is their songs that have helped her to grow as a contemporary vocalist. Her earliest material was written by songwriters from the 20's through 50's which made her seem outdated by the late sixties. She did have much new material that was written for Broadway or was dramatic enough to be a scene from a show or revue and being an actress, Barbra delivered. However, Broadway-styled material could only go so far to sell records. She needed to become more contemporary and though it did not produce hits immediately, her recordings of the Bergmans' lyrics transformed her style making it less over-the-top and more introspective.<br /><br />One of her earliest recordings of their songs is one of her finest ever, \\"What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?\\" from 1969. The lyrics are typical of their exploration of love and commitment. A far cry from Barbra's earliest ironic songs \\"Cry Me a River\\", \\"Down with Love\\", and \\"Love is a Bore\\" but closer in spirit to her earlier hits \\"People\\" and \\"He Touched Me\\". So, she was on track when she chose to record their works. It made sense also because the Bergmans wrote so frequently for movies and Barbra always used her acting talents to interpret lyrics. When Barbra sang \\"The Way We Were\\" in the background of her movie, it became more than just a beautiful song but her character's inner thoughts and in the end the movie's message. This of course added up to big sales and a number one hit on Billboard. The same combination of meaningful lyrics with superb acting came together for \\"Yentl\\" but this time for an entire song score. Both projects brought the Bergmans Academy Awards for writing. So not only did the Bergmans help Barbra's career it was vice versa. \\"You Don't Bring Me Flowers\\" was a commercial and artistic triumph when she recorded it with Neil Diamond. The words so resonated with the public that sales of flowers went up as a result. The duet version makes one easily forget their seperate solo recordings.<br /><br />Listening to What Matters Most, I wonder how did these songs by the Bergmans never get recorded by Barbra before? They are as well suited to Barbra's style as the 51 Bergman songs she previously recorded. At the length of 41:39 its the shortest album of her hers since \\"Wet\\" back in 1979 when albums were not much longer than 40 minutes. Barbra says in the liner notes that her total songs recorded by them now totaled 63 after this album which hints that she intended 12 songs originally. But this ten song collection seems the perfect length both in total and individual tracks. With Barbra the sole producer her increased confidence is evident in the choices made. The arrangements are similar to The Movie Album, which was glorious but sometimes a bit overdone, and some songs hard to get into. Every song on What Matters Most draws you in and keeps you there from one moment to the next. It helps to have a common theme of love which is reminiscent of her album A Love Like Ours. But unlike the 1999 release Barbra mixes up the tempos such as \\"Nice n Easy\\" which starts out slow and builds to a jazzy finish with arrangement by Patrick Williams. \\"That Face\\" which Barbra featured briefly during her Circus Medley on Color Me Barbra gets the full treatment here with a bright, joyful sound that fits with the adoring lyrics. Then there's \\"So Many Stars\\" with an exciting Brazilian arrangement by William Ross actually featuring lyrics sung in Portuguese! Barbra was also blessed to have excellent trumpet soloist Chris Botti and sax soloist Dan Higgins. As producer Barbra knows how to assemble the ideal team.<br /><br />Even with the uptempo arrangements, nothing is more exciting than the first minute of the album when she sings \\"The Windmills of Your Mind\\" acapella. It is a risky move for any singer at her age, that is any singer except Barbra. She may have a few slight hoarse moments that would have never been allowed during her earlier perfectionist years. Yet she hits all the high notes and is still the best at conveying a lyricist's intentions. Especially when she has lyrics by the Bergmans who, as Barbra says in the liner notes, have found so many ways to say \\"I Love You.\\" with lyrics that have a \\"poetic grace that's completely unique.\\"<br /><br />****While the deluxe edition does contain tracks that have all appeared on previous Barbra releases (I own all such releases on cd except for one--Barbra Joan Streisand) it is great to have this collection as a companion to the new tracks. It further helps to point out how perfect the Bergmans have been for Barbra and vice versa.<br /><br />Recommended new tracks: \\"The Windmills of Your Mind\\", \\"The Same Hello, The Same Goodbye\\", \\"That Face\\", \\"Nice n Easy\\"<br /><br />Recommended classic tracks: \\"What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?\\",  \\"Papa Can You Hear Me?\\", \\"You Don't Bring Me Flowers\\", \\"The Summer Knows\\"m when she sings \\"The Windmills of Your Mind\\" acapella.

B004NJW96C|5.0|I am still learning more about this incredible artist - and have not heard all his work.  However, I have heard much of his work - and prefer this CD.  If you like ambient/electronica with some beat and soulful vocals - this CD is brilliant.  It really is art.  Each song is subject to the listener's emotional interpretation - Moby just sets the table.  In each song I feel like my heart is free-falling through the air - but without any anxiety.  What other music can do that to a ham-fisted, hard-hearted case like me ?
B004OFWLO0|5.0|It is impossible for any Robert Johnson collection to claim to be \\"definitive,\\" and most of us long ago gave up counting the number of \\"gold standard\\" editions there are. Each edition should be judged, I believe, not against the perfect Robert Johnson but against the average. How far does the disk in front of you exceed what you consider an \\"average\\" collation of Johnson material? In this case, it exceeds the average by a few parsecs. This is not a raving, picture book fanboi collection, and it is not entirely the audiophile's obsessive compulsive disorder variorum disk. Instead, there are two versions of the Robert Johnson set, and the performances are as haunting, amused, and various as anyone could hope for.

B002MFU9BG|5.0|I recently heard this on a local radio station and was blown away.  Then I realized this was the great music from the Kia commercial.  I immediately went to Amazon and just entered the words I thought might be the title.  And there it was!  I loved reading the first review for \\"How you like me now?\\"  I wondered how old is this?  Well, not very.  And thought if James Brown and Morris Day had a love child this would be it. Which is very similar to the first reviewer's opinion.  I plan to investigate the rest of the album for more absolute gems.
1250004349|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  I loved the authors writing also.  I feel that the characters were well established in the book.  The story really pulled me in right away. I now want to see the film, but I'm sure I'll be disappointed.  As always, the book is better.  I will definitely be looking up other books written by this author.

0062060554|3.0|What an interesting concept this book is based on!  And what a horrifying, frightening way to live.  It's hard to imagine how stressful life would be if every night you forgot everything and then had to start each day from scratch, clueless even as to who you are. I'm interested in finding out more about the real-life cases that the author says inspired this novel.      Even though I found the story to be predictable and not at all surprising in the end, it was still a page-turner for me.  I was fascinated by the character of Christine and how she was managing her difficult life and what she'd encounter day to day. I ached for her each morning and especially when she had to experience fresh, raw grief over and over again.

0765365278|5.0|The Way of Kings, by Brandon Sanderson, manages to do something that is rarely seen in modern fantasy and sci-fi writing. Sanderson, by emphasizing the development of characters over small, episodic chapters (similar to George R.R. Martin's Song of Fire and Ice books) creates a world that is novel, living, and highly appealing. The world of Roshar, the setting for Sanderson's book, is lovingly crafted, with a distinct mythology that mixes elements of fantasy with a slightly science fiction twinge. Sanderson also masterfully builds a set of technology powered by gemstones and warfare augmented by \\"infused\\" Shardplate (a neat mix of the powered armor of Starship Troopers and magical platemail so often seen fantasy) and mysterious Shardblades. The world that Sanderson created is full of mysteries, the nature of which only become briefly delved into by the end (and clearly awaiting sequels in the series to become fully explained).     The book is full of action and intrigue and, in a strange way the rich setting, the plots and wars, the powerful characters, and the slowly unveiling mysteries remind me of the first time I read Frank Herbert's Dune. The Way of Kings is a fantasy novel of the old stripe, one that builds a compelling mythology and drops the reader into lives and plans already in progress, with the sense that there is a larger picture just barely out of reach. All of this adds up to a book that is very hard to put down, a quick read despite the large page count.     As I said, the driving forces behind The Way of Kings are the rich and well fleshed-out character. Unlike similar books, which rely upon a group of characters only incidentally connected to one another, all of the personalities in The Way of Kings are interesting, easy to relate to, and well-defined. I never found myself trying to rush through one character's section to get to the section of another \\"favorite\\" character (as I did with the Song of Fire and Ice series). All of the characters were my \\"favorite,\\" each story had elements that I wanted to find out more about or see more fully developed. It is a testament to Sanderson's skill that all of his characters are so compelling. Some readers might be irked, given the trend in fantasy, to not get the \\"bad guy's\\" perspective, or that the characters (at least in this initial book) are all relatively well seen as the protagonists of the book, but there is enough internal conflict within each character to keep the story moving without being dull. I suspect this will change as new things are revealed in the next entries in the series.    In way of critique, I would say that The Way of Kings, while set in a novel world with strong characters, does tend to fall back on tried fantasy tropes. The journey of self-discovery, finding hidden internal strength, wrestling with mental demons - all of these common elements appear in The Way of Kings and some readers may be less \\"floored\\" by late-book revelations than others. I was pleasantly surprised by the plot twists that did pop up, however, even if they weren't exactly revolutionary and were a tad derivative. A second critique would be that this first book spends a large amount of time detailing the world and leaving a lot of open plotlines and questions. Clearly this is designed to keep readers coming back and to sell a series, and hopefully Sanderson will be able to answer all the questions in subsequent books while maintaining the momentum of the first.     As a side note, I very much appreciated the more family and young-adult friendly content of The Way of Kings. In recent years, the sexual and violent content of the fantasy and science fiction genre has seemed to be increasing. The presence of a graphic sex scene or a horribly violent event in many books has become rather gratuitous, adding very little to storyline. While I am a mature adult, and don't mind this sort of thing if it is integral to developing a novel, it seems silly to include scenes such as theseto simply pander to a reader's visceral senses. I am happy to report that The Way of Kings does not fall back on this, and the content is relatively PG without seeming juvenile - proving that not every entry in fantasy and science fiction need rely upon needless graphic content to seem mature and serious. Barring the intense scenes of combat, there is little in The Way of Kings to prevent younger audiences, 12+, from enjoying the story responsibly.    Readers that love intricately, well-crafted worlds will very much enjoy Sanderson's new endeavor with the Stormlight Archive. The book has that epic feel that one felt when reading the fantasy of our younger days, when good squared off against an upcoming doom with honor, passion, intelligence, honesty, and sometimes pathos. A stark contrast to the new wave of \\"dark\\" fantasy, the Way of Kings reinvigorates the days of shining armor and sword, chivalry and majesty, and does so with powerful characters that will grab your interest and have you wanting more. In fact, the wait for book two is already difficult, and I only just now put down the book!     N.B. regarding the Kindle Edition, which I read. The Way of Kings includes several interesting maps and beautifully rendered illustrations of events and people in the book. The Kindle Edition makes these a tad more difficult to see, so readers wanting better quality versions of these should think about the physical copy. That being said, the convenience of having a huge and heavy book in the small Kindle format is hard to deny.

B0041KKYBA|5.0|I must admit that I had been putting off watching \\"Inside Job,\\" Charles Ferguson's Oscar-winning documentary about the recent financial collapse, for quite some time.  I just wasn't sure I had the intestinal fortitude and emotional stamina necessary to get me through what I knew would be a maddening and infuriating experience (audiences who initially saw it in theaters were reportedly ready to tear down the buildings when the movie was over).  But I finally broke down and took the plunge - and I haven't regretted it for a moment.  For if it is indeed true that knowledge is power and that to be forewarned is to be forearmed, then understanding what caused this global financial failure is the first step in preventing it from happening again.  And that's where \\"Inside Job\\" comes in.<br /><br />If any film has ever merited that overused phrase \\"a must-see movie,\\" surely it is this one.  Indeed, it should be seen by all persons, regardless of socioeconomic status or political persuasion, who care anything about the powers-that-be who control our lives.  Ferguson lays it all out for us in terms we can all comprehend and cope with, no matter how literate or illiterate in the ways of economics we may be.  That's no small feat, believe me.<br /><br />Narrated by Matt Damon, the film puts the events leading up to the crash in chronological order.  The first part of the film is entitled \\"How We Got Here,\\" which chronicles how the financial regulations put in place during the Great Depression - and which provided us with nearly forty years of prosperity and financial stability thereafter - were systematically dismantled, beginning with the Reagan administration and continuing on through those of the two Bushes and Clinton.  Ferguson attacks the infamous de-regulation of the savings-and-loan industry that occurred in the 1980s; the dismantling of the Glass-Steagall Act that used to keep commercial and investment banks separate, thereby protecting the general public's money from being used for high-risk investment schemes;  the increasing influence of corporate lobbyists on members of Congress; the continuous merger of lending institutions into ever expanding \\"too big to fail\\" financial behemoths;  and, perhaps most tellingly of all, the failure on the part of the regulatory Securities and Exchange Commission to do anything to rein in the excesses.  Ferguson then goes on to explain how derivatives and credit default swaps allowed banks to bundle risky mortgages until the whole financial market was nothing more than a \\"global ponzi scheme,\\" destined as all ponzi schemes are, to crash of its own weight, allowing a select handful of people at the top to make off with fortunes while leaving the rest of us holding the bag.<br /><br />In the second section, entitled \\"The Bubble,\\" the movie explores the psychology of many of the folk on Wall Street, who crave ever more piles of money and ever more lavish lifestyles while not caring who it is they hurt on their way to the top.  And, of course, with this lifestyle come rampant drug use, prostitution, gambling and all manners of licentious living, often on the company dime.<br /><br />Part Three, \\"The Crisis,\\" features some of the many Cassandras of the time - those voices crying in the wilderness who saw what was happening and even predicted the dire outcome but who couldn't get anyone to listen to them.  This section also traces the cause-and-effect relationship that began with mortgage fraud which then led to home foreclosures and investment banks being stuck with loans they couldn't sell.<br /><br />Then came the fall of Bear Stearns in March 2008, the federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the downfalls of Lehman Brothers and AIG in September of that year.  The result was a government bailout to the tune of $700 billion, worldwide recession, massive unemployment, a housing market collapse, and six million home foreclosures in the United States alone.  Ferguson even visits a tent citymodeled on the Hoovervilles of the 1930s where many of the newly jobless now reside.<br /><br />Most of the outrage, however, is reserved for Part Four, ironically entitled \\"Accountability.\\"  Here Ferguson shows how the very people most responsible for the collapse managed to walk away with their fortunes intact, leaving the rest of us to suffer the consequences of their actions.  And to make matters worse, not a single person in the financial sector was charged with a crime, let alone convicted of one.  In fact, any attempts at reforming the system appear to have gone in the absolutely wrong direction, with the major banks even larger than they were before, thanks, in large part, to the three thousand-plus financial sector lobbyists who descended on Washington in the years following the crash.<br /><br />Ferguson wraps up the film with \\"Where We Are Now,\\" which looks at how, over the past thirty years, the income gap separating the rich from everyone else has grown into a yawning chasm, how the nation's power in the world has decreased accordingly, how jobs have been shipped overseas and the manufacturing base decimated, how college educations have become virtually out-of-reach for many youngsters, and how the middle class has been buried under a mountain of personal debt.<br /><br />And if you think things have improved with the election of Obama, Ferguson is quick to point out that the Wall Street \\"reforms\\" his administration has put in place are incredibly weak and that most of his senior economic advisers - Ben Bernanke, Timothy Geithner, et. al. - are the very same people who helped create the problem in the first place.<br /><br />So there you have it, a dense, fast-moving, beautifully shot look at the most important story of recent times.  It says a great deal that the individuals most at fault for the crisis refused to be interviewed for the film.<br /><br />You may prefer to ignore the uncomfortable truths unearthed by this phenomenal film, but you do so at your own risk.ny of the newly jobless now reside.

B004GUSG4M|5.0|This book is very, very good.<br />Memories really define us. What are we without memories? If the only thing you have are other people's words as memories, how can you be sure what's true?<br /><br />The book has a good prose, written in first person, as if Christine were telling us at the time of speaking what's happening to her. It makes everything very believable - which means you are never sure what to believe, since she herself has just what others tell her and her journal to rely on.<br /><br />Of course the main mystery is easy to find out, or at least to guess. And, sometimes it bothers you that she remembers exactly the perfect thing at the perfect time, but I think it's almost impossible to write a good story with a plot like this without any cliches.  S. J. Watson does it in a great way.<br /><br />I really liked this novel. I strongly recommend it.

He will be remembered for ruining cultural icons of America!<br /><br />I swear if these latest rumors is true, I am cancelling my pre-order!!  If Lucas is going to do all this garbage, at least give us remastered HD versions of the originals!!  Unaltered so we don't have to watch these \\"improvements\\".<br /><br />To think these movies helped define my life.. it's a shame to see them morph into something so sad.<br /><br />I am a Star Wars fanatic, but I will not purchase or support these unnecessary and unasked for alterations.<br /><br />Do what you want to the prequels, no one cares about them anyway.

B00009R6BF|5.0|This flex arm is very handy for holding small reflector panels or small light fixtures. However, I did try it with a relatively light compact fluorescent lamp+socket+reflector bowl and would not stay in place. Had to get the \\"heavy duty\\" version that worked like a charm, albeit it is much heavier though.    If you want to use it for small stuff then you can attach it to the special receptacle of a super clamp or, as I used, screwed to a 1/4 (I think) end of a light stand to create a flexible extension.
B0041KKYEM|4.0|This film received an AA nomination for Best Picture. Tale focuses on a young ballerina who gets the major part as the Swan Queen (in Tchaikovsky's SWAN LAKE) but there is an issue as to whether she has the personality for the Black Swan. The stress only increases her mental illness which leads to a sometimes wonderfully creepy experience. Cassel does a great job as the head honcho of the studio, exhibiting a difficulty artist personality who you have to listen to if you want to have a career.<br /><br />Good focus on the subcultural life of ballet, especially in body expressions. Winona Ryder has a small part in this film (yes, she's still around). I thought they were going to ruin the ending but they pulled it off. Portman won Best Actress for this picture and the director was nominated.<br /><br />CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus to A minus; STORY/PLOTTING: B plus; BALLET SUBCULTURE: B plus; MY GRADE: B plus; WHEN WATCHED: end of August 2011.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Is that everyone is angry that Lucas messed with yet more scenes from the original trilogy...but that you'd of bought this crap had he not have inserted the 'NOOOOOOO\\" in ROTJ?!?!?!?!  I love the original SW movies as much as the next guy, but Episodes 1-3 were absolutely freakin' HORRIBLE!  All of them.  Why would you give that moron another cent of your hard earned money if he's going to force (ha...pun) you to buy those absolutely worthless pieces of garbage???  I mean...I guess you could open up the box and just go ahead and throw them away, but you're still supporting that meglomaniac who refuses to acknowledge how terrible those movies were.  YOu're still paying money for them...money that you could use to say...light on fire and then drop in your toilet....I mean...it would be a better, more entertaining use of it...  Boycott the whole thing and maybe he'll hire someone to make a 7-9 that can salvage some semblance of this truly fallen franchise.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I avoided Angry Birds for the longest time, thinking it was just some silly fad. Shirts, stuffed animals, stickers, tons of merchandise was everywhere for this game and I couldn't see why. All you do is shoot birds from a slingshot at blocks and pigs? Then I downloaded the demo...and bought the game within minutes. Angry Birds Rio got me into the whole Angry Birds craze, and after completing it, I quickly took care of the other two games in the series too, though this one remains my favorite, and it's still getting levels through updates! Who knew you could have so much fun playing a cheap downloadable game? I certainly didn't think I'd be playing this for as long as I did.    What can I say about Angry Birds that will convince you to get the game? You're better off playing the demo and seeing if you like it for yourself. This version ties in with the animated movie Rio, using locations and characters from the movie for its levels. Pickpocket monkeys, Nigel the prissy cockatoo and a few others show up, including a certain dog that loves to chase birds. There are tons of levels in this game and they follow the same Angry Birds formula, though instead of just taking out pigs, you're trying to free caged birds and thrash monkeys too. All the old Birds are here: Red, Yellow, Blue, White, etc. as well as Blu and Jewel from Rio. 'not to spoil anything but they're chained together, but later on get separated. Jewel can fly straight forward, going through certain obstacles before losing momentum, even with Blu attached to her. Blu on his own, however, just tumbles about when you tap the screen after he's released from the slingshot. It's helpful for taking out big towers made of harder materials since he moves it all over the place. The physics in this game also seem improved from the previous versions, with harder materials breaking weaker ones easier depending on how they fall. Very rarely did I ever go 'OH COME ON!' because a monkey was under a pile of debris that just wouldn't crush him, like I did in the last two games, but it still happens now and then. But hey, that just makes you try harder and get better scores!    Stages are cleared when all the birds are freed, or when all the enemies are gone. You get points for everything that breaks, and bonus points for any birds left over when the stage is completed. The game then ranks your skills between one and three stars. Get all three stars for every level and see what goodies await. There are also fruit and other objects hidden in various levels that add up to more goodies, as well as a hidden stage that was revealed if you bought the Rio movie...or went and saw a video of how to unlock it.    The game's stupidly cheap, and if you like the demo or just plain love Angry Birds, it's hard to argue with tons of levels for such a low price. I feel like a kid again playing this simple yet addicting game, and can't wait to see what the final stages are like.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read.  I liked the story, the writing, the character development, and everything else.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Seriously?   There are more changes to the original film?  I will not be buying these movies now.  Ordered the set and canceled it after the news.   Thanks again for making the originals matching the prequels in quality.  Considering the prequels were mediocre at best.
B004FOA84A|5.0|I really enjoyed this game, if I would say anything negative I'd say that the game was too short and the story could be more flushed out but I have found myself looking for other games like this.

B003L77GRO|4.0|Well, I hate to have to do this but I'm going to have to give this season only 4 stars. Up until this season as far as I was concerned the show could do no wrong. Don't get me wrong, it's still better than most stuff you will watch, it's just not up to the \\"Dexter\\" standard. My problems with this season, caution, mild spoiler alert!! Something had to be done, but the first two episodes were a bit too heavy for \\"Dexter\\". They should have been pulled back from a bit or offset with a more upbeat parallel story line. The first two episodes left be a bit more bummed out than I am looking for from Dexter. Another issue I had was I have no idea where Lumen got her money to \\"survive\\" from. It was never explained, and considering her circumstances should have been. It was written like she had none (needed help from Dexter) but see seemed to have no problem coming up with enough cash to rent hotel rooms, buy clothes, expensive coffee a gun, etc. It just didn't make a ton of sense. And last but certainly not least, overall the Dexter's character was taken in a direction of \\"having feelings\\". I can understand why the writers took things in that direction. They wanted to make him more human and evolving characters is one of the basics when it comes to writing. The problem in this case is Dexter is a SOCIOPATH! Sociopaths don't develop feelings, that's what makes them sociopaths. I would have been far more impressed if Dexter incorporated sorrow, grief, guilt, etc into his outward persona to blend in (like he has in the past). But I can't swallow that he is becoming more \\"human\\", sociopaths don't do that. So in this case I think the writers did Dexter's character a disservice and are loosing sight of who he really is. There are many more examples like these, but I don't want to rant. In addition to the story issues there were some inexcusable editing mistakes. Things like \\"Hey, that car wasn't parked like that in the other camera angle\\". Or, \\"That was not in his hand in the last shot\\". And when exactly did Dexter's SUV window get magically fixed??? Those little things drive me nuts and that is not what I expect from the series. Showtime needs to tighten the ship up a bit.<br /><br />That being said it was still worth every dollar and I about watched it all the way though. I hope next season Dexter gets back to \\"Dexter\\" a little better. Back to basics if you will. I think the \\"Touchy Feely\\" stuff has run its course. We need the Dark Dexter back for a few seasons.shot\\". And when exactly did Dexter's SUV window get magically fixed???

B000002G26|5.0|For all you Bryan Adams fans, get this cd! For all you non-Bryan Adams fans get this cd. It is awesome! I skip maybe one song, \\"It's Only Love\\", I don't care for that one. One thing I love is the recorded volume. Great sounding cd with great songs. Just start playing it and enjoy!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|If it ain't broke.....  You know, in truth, I don't care what changes Lucas makes to the Star Wars movies.  I just wish I'd have the choice to choose which version I want to watch.  I love the idea of getting the entire set on Blu-Ray in one nice box but I think I'll sit this one out - at least until the official release so I can know what's really in there.  Besides, how long before the 3D versions are release (individually at first of course and then in a set).  They'll likely suck with the changes that will be made there as well.
B004RKXN44|4.0|I have often found that when an author pens a series for too long, the series becomes stale.  This was the one book in this series that I held a cautious breath in anticipation of its release.  OMG!!!  I loved this story.  It made me laugh out loud, it made me shed a few tears, it made me angry in some instances and the eventual conclusion for the main characters made me happy.  What more can you ask for in a a great story?    I appreciated knowing more of Sienna's story and I appreciated that Hawke was exactly the same man/leopard/Alpha that he had been throughout the series.  This was just a really great read and I highly recommend it.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|You know, I wouldn't be so hard on the changes if they were mere polishes and not degrading to the integrity of the films themselves. The fact that Lucas constantly seeks to do this in this manner to the original films, and not even to the prequels, is baffling. What. The. Hell. Not buying. Wait for the inevitable second wave of Blu-Rays. If they're anything like the DVD releases, they may have the original films in their original forms. Shame too, since I enjoy some of the changes -- fixed errors (transparent cockpit in Empire, enhanced lightsaber effects, better Emperor in ESB), better music and saga-binding ending for the '97 edition of RotJ, etc. -- but I'd also love to have an anamorphic, HD presentation of the films as they were a long time ago, before I was even born, for both posterity's and historical sake. I hope the original version of Empire Strikes Back was chosen for preservation in the National Film Registry, and not this one. Go have Criterion do a restoration or something. SOMETHING!
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|I bought this mic to plug into my ZOOM H1 Handy Recorder. Instead of wasting money to buy a wireless mic setup for my camera, I used the mic & H1 to record audio and sync it up later in post. It sounds really good for only 20 bux. You'll have to take off some low-end on the EQ while in post, but other than that...you can't really beat it for the price amazon sells it for. H1 + AT3350 = $125 \\"wireless\\" mic pack. Credit to www cheesycam dot com for coming up with this idea and testing it out before I bought any components for the setup.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Well, isn't it interesting how bent everyone is getting about these changes to the new Blu Ray release.    I for one, liked many of the additions in the Special Editions (the new dramatic escape of the Falcon in Mos Eisley was one example).  The simple fact is this; These are Georges movies.  We are only along for the ride.   I compare his movies to how Walt Disney felt about his Disneyland...it will never truly be 'finished'.    They recently updated the Star Tours attractions at Disneyland and Walt Disney World and you don't hear the SW fans complaining about all the updated awesomeness.    Some of the changes are a little strange (Han should ALWAYS have shot first).   But Yoda did look awful in Episode I and I'm glad he addressed it.   Did Darth Vader need to scream 'noooooo!' in the end of VI?  no but it will fit better i the scheme of the 6 movies.    I suppose if he would just put out an original theatrical release version of the 3 movies, then there would be nothing for them to complain about, but I'm guessing somehow they still would.     Would they be happy if the sound was left all scratchy and imperfect?  I doubt it.   I for one would pass on it.  I always felt some of the early ILM effects don't play very well these days, even if they were amazing in their day.    My life is better having experienced all the Star Wars movies.   I will gladly buy these when they come out.  I wonder if this will be one of the best selling 'worst-reviewed' titles of all time?    Complain all you want.   I plan on having a viewing party with all my SW friends.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Just give us the originals! It doesn't work like this, George. Even if the changes were good, I would still want to watch the movies I completely memorized as a kid. What Mr. Lucas is doing to his fans is one of the most atrocious fan treatments I've ever seen.
B0029XZODY|5.0|I haven't watched it yet, but, if it's as good as the first two seasons, I'll be happy.  Delivery was prompt and packaging secure.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I for one am waiting on the edge of my seat to watch the Star Wars Saga on blu ray. I have been a fan since before I can remember (literally). No matter what others say about changes and CGI, I will forever love sitting down and becoming immersed in the galaxy far, far away. I can't wait to see the deleted scenes and see the original trilogy in blu ray quality. And yes, I even enjoy the prequels, so I look forward to seeing what should be ridiculously awesome transfers coming straight from the digital source.   Don't listen to all the naysayer geeks who are freaking out about minor changes that don't affect characters or storyline in any way. Go out, buy this set, and enjoy 12+ hours of cinematic fun.   May the force be with you.
B000J103WK|1.0|This disc is an \\"HD DVD\\" which to my surprise is a \\"bastard format\\" that plays on very few players. Don't make the same mistake I did instead order the DVD format. This really should be mentioned in the ad.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|So sick of George's BS with this.  Just leave it alone.  You've done enough damage.  We want the originals, not doctored ones.  It's not so hard to understand.

B004U52VPS|5.0|My sons are fans of the Angry Birds game on PC and phone. They only get to earn play time for it once a week. They love this stand alone game and play it with or without the cards that come with the game. It has let to a lot of imagination play as well. This is well suited for kids 5 and older.   The using of the pulley to fire the bird at the blocks is tricky. We've built each set on top of the box and used the pulley system from right next to the box. We've also been lax on number of tries it takes to knock down the pigs.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|More alterations have been done to the original movies.  Please do not support this practice.  Do not buy anything until Lucasfilm releases the original, unaltered movies.
B004UFEJXK|5.0|WALL-E is charming. Love this film.  Packaging is great; beautiful. I bought this to update my Pixar blu-ray collection.  I don't believe anything new was added in this repackaging. Just a re-release with new combo pack packaging.

B000005RQT|5.0|This is one of Deep Purple's best albums.  A hard rock gem that is up there with Machine Head.  If you are a Deep Purple fan, this is a must have.  If you are new to Deep Purple's music, starting with In Rock and Machine Head is a great introduction to the MK II lineup with Ian Gillan on vocals.    Be sure to get the remastered version, because the original CD version's sound quality is horrible on some of the songs.  The Anniversary Edition is a good remaster and contains some excellent bonus tracks.
B003XKB0RG|4.0|The double Earth, Wind & Fire album from 1980 that features \\"Let Me Talk,\\" \\"And Love Goes On,\\" and \\"You,\\" was released as a limited edition CD in 1989.  The recording was inferior as the CD was just a straight AAD transfer.  However, the CD had value as a collector's item because only a few were produced until it became a remastered import in 2008.  A lack of marketing push and a poor choice of single releases caused this fine album to slip through the cracks of mainstream radio.  The group sang with their hearts and God-given talent for the sake of making great music on \\"Faces\\" without sacrificing their integrity just to meet a quota for the record company.  Though it may seem like a waste of money to buy the album again since I had already purchased the analog CD a few years back, I felt it was worth the re-investment because the songs that I liked from \\"Faces\\" deserved to be heard and appreciated with lasting sentiment.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|I liked Alchemy, then I read that Doodle God was even better, so I downloaded the free version from the Google Market.  It worked well on my Evo 3D, and when I checked Amazon and found it available here, I decided to purchase it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Amazon's version of the game is VERY far behind Google's.  The version Google has is 1.4.1.3, Amazon's is only 1.3.  It appears Amazon's version hasn't been updated in over 5 months!  Alas, this version does NOT work properly on my Evo 3D.<br /><br />It's a great game, but don't buy it from Amazon, get it from Google if you ever hope to see updates.  I only hope Amazon will give me my money back.<br /><br />EDIT:  The game finally got updated on Amazon, but now it's utterly broken.  This version has actually been pulled from Google by the developer because of all the problems, but slowpoke Amazon still has the defective version.<br /><br />2nd EDIT:  There is a new update which supposedly fixes the force close issue (I haven't tried it out yet).  The current version is 1.4.2.4, which actually puts it ahead of Google (which still reports version 1.4.1.6) at the moment.  Only time will tell whether the developer will keep the Amazon version up to date or if it will fall behind like in the past.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Why does George Lucas want to destroy everything we love? Does he truly hate his fans?     He truly has turned to the dark side.
B003ZSJ212|2.0|Two words:  &#34;No.... Nooooooooooooooooooooooo!&#34;<br /><br />That's what kept me from getting this pack when it came out in 2011.  I always MUST have the cool Blu Ray pack the day it comes out, but not this one.<br /><br />I very much made my peace with the old (and infamous) changes GL made to the original trilogy, but as soon as I saw the trailers with the new changes for the Blu Ray, that was a deal breaker.  Fast forward 2015, I saw this in the Amazon second hand market at 40 bucks.  Since it was in good condition (and I haven't seen the original films in a veeeery long time), I pulled the trigger.  I start watching the movies and I thought &#34;I should have bought this form the get go.<br /><br />Then I start watching Return of the Jedi...<br /><br />We all know that very important changes apply to Star Wars (like Greedo shooting first, new musical numbers in Mos Eisley, and Jabba talking with Han, between others), and we all know the changes made in Empire Strikes Back, which were relatively minor, but the changes, and specially, the NEW changes made in ROTJ were painful.  Actually PAINFUL!!  And more specifically, the fact that Lucas added voice on Vader in the scene in which the Emperor is frying Luke by saying &#34;No... NOOOOOOOO!&#34; is unforgivable.<br /><br />The camera work was perfect!!  We all knew Vader was in conflict when the Emperor was killing Luke.  So WHY adding voice to that??<br /><br />The last slap in the face was in the very last scene in Jedi, in which Luke sees Obi Wan, Yoda, and... Hyden Christensen???  My friends told me this change was made sicne the DVDs, but I never saw it.  WTF??!!!  To a casual fan the reaction is &#34;Who is that?&#34;, and the immediate response would be &#34;that's the guy who plays Anakin in the horrible prequels.<br /><br />And lets me fair, I have nothing against Hyden Christensen, but honestly he doesn't belong in the original triogy.  And for those &#34;purist&#34; who say &#34;It makes perfect sense because Anakin is presented with the image he had when he was good&#34;, well I'll say &#34;The last time he was good was when he saved Luke from the Emperor and restored balance to the Force (?)&#34;  I don't like much the last part because in all true.. we just don't know anything about that &#34;prophesy&#34; Lucas tried to sold us with the prequels.<br /><br />Anyway, I hate Lucasfilms made changes to tie the original films with the horrible prequels.  Because of that, I'm thinking that I was scamed with $40.  Who knew.<br /><br />I give this set a 2 and a half stars because of the technical aspects.  The films are still great (the originals anyway), but they come with unnecesary crap that only distracts you.se because Anakin is presented with the image he had when he was good&#34;, well I'll say &#34;The last time he was good was when he saved Luke from the Emperor and restored balance to the Force (?)&#34;  I don't like much the last part because in all true.. we just don't know anything about that &#34;prophesy&#34; Lucas tried to sold us with the prequels.<br /><br />Anyway, I hate Lucasfilms made changes to tie the original films with the horrible prequels.

B001HNE3NO|3.0|This book was one that I couldn't put down--maybe because I always wanted to end on a happy note (which did not come often). The book is very historically accurate, though the characters themselves are fictional. It is a completely heart-wrenching story centered around two characters, a young Jewish girl who was a victim of a roundup in the Holocaust, and a woman in present-day France who finds herself moving into the girl's apartment years later.     Having never heard of the Vel d'Hiv roundup, I was appalled at the truth of it all. I looked it up later and was surprised at how much research the author had done. I also used to be very interested in learning about World War II and the Holocaust. Books about it never really bothered me before, but I have also never read one involving small children.     I only give it three stars because the story was so difficult to read. The historical accuracy and the way the characters intertwine certainly make it worth anyone's time.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I'm 38 and for the first time of my life I will not buy this Star Wars video release. The additions, especially the Vader NO are ridiculous and this has to stop at one point.    Lucas is completely out of touch with reality and being the only powerful guy that nobody can say anything to him, he is doing obsessive ridiculous things.    Lucas try to remember again, movie making and Star Wars as you said before, is not a one man work. It was a collaborative effort and the input of all those great people, made it great. Star Wars is not great just because of you. YOU DIDN'T MAKE STAR WARS.    Learn from Lord of the Rings George. I just gladly bought again the entire trilogy on Bluray.
B002Q1YDLI|4.0|While this book is billed as a continuation of the story from Something Borrowed, it focuses a lot more on Darcy and the aftermath of what happened in the first book. It doesn't mention Rachel much at all. It's another chick lit book that is great to get out of your own life for a while, maybe to read at the beach.     SPOILER ALERT:  I wasn't thrilled with the ending, because of course you want the two girls to just be best friends again. Not a bad read, though!
B001MSMULG|5.0|No lie. If you added up the total time it took me to read The Kill Artist --> The Messenger, it was more or less 6 days. God created the world in 6 days and rested on the 7th, I read 6 Daniel Silva (Gabriel Allon) novels in 6 days, and cannot bring myself to stop or rest at all.    These books are absolutely amazing. The characters, the descriptions of the places and sights, the thrilling suspense, you WILL NOT be able to put the book (or kindle) down. The fact that I am able to instantly download and start reading the next book in the series makes this addiction truly scary.     If you love fast-paced spy novels that really dive into nitty-gritty of the business, read DANIEL SILVA.
159514188X|5.0|For anyone who interacts with young people, I feel this is a must-read.  While it is a fictional account, if you have ever spent a significant amount of time around teenagers, you will recognize some aspects of how they live and, sadly, why some of them choose to take their own lives.    This book has changed how I listen to them in class, in the hallway, in conversation, and in their silence.      It's never too late to say, \\"How are you? What are you thinking? There are people who care about you.\\"
B00540G3G6|5.0|I love this movie. I have it on Laser Disc, DVD, Blu-Ray and now on Blu-Ray 3D. This version on 3D has a beautiful transfer. It's like being inside the movie with the puppets. the aspect ratio from this 3D version has change from 1:66 to 1:85 to fill the screen.The 3D effects are very subtle since this movie was not shot in 3d originally; but the convertion is very good. If you love this movie and have a 3D capable TV this is a no brainer.

0439023521|5.0|I positively devoured The Hunger Games as many did before me. While Katniss's world is often viewed as a dystopia, I view it more as a post-apocalyptic world as few citizen's really believe that everything is perfect. One of my favorite things in fiction is a strong female lead, and Katniss served these purposes to the fullest. Katniss has spent her life since her father died providing for her mother and younger sister by hunting, trading, and entering her name in for The Hunger Games extra times in exchange for extra provisions. She would do anything to protect her little sister, including entering herself into almost certain death by competing in The Hunger Games.<br /><br />She is a character that is easy to cheer for, even if she perhaps utterly dense on romantic feelings towards her. The romance in the books, is really the one problem that I had with the series, and that is because of the 'first love' that takes place in the past. This sort of romantic triangle seems to be happening in a lot of the books I've read lately (The Iron Fey, Matched) and for me, it's never the 'triangle' that is intended to be, as I much less reason to cheer for the first love, then I do the one I watch happening. Despite this however, the Hunger Games did succeed in making me want to see more of the Gale's character, as I want more chances for him to make me love him over Peeta.<br /><br />Peeta I adored, as I loved that he didn't have to always be the strong one. It was a great 'turnabout is fair play' move, with watching the female character be more of a provider and protector then that of the male lead. There are a few other side character in The Hunger Games that I absolutely adored, and would love to see more of as well.<br /><br />Despite that The Hunger games was more action-packed then I usually like my books to be, I was hooked the entire time. For Katniss, every bit of action is an emotional decision, and because of that I never found myself skimming over the action scenes as I have in the past. The Hunger Games is an original concept, with the only thing coming to mind that is similar, Battle Royale.The Hunger Games is an original concept, with the only thing coming to mind that is similar, Battle Royale.
B004QIG7CW|5.0|My children and I watched the DVD.The extended scenes were great.  Music was terrific and actors from Disney channel did a terrific job.
B0001ARCFA|4.0|When I first tried these I was disappointed.  The midrange and highs were too harsh and tinty to a point where it was unpleasant to listen to music. After reading a couple of posts that mentioned a breakin period was needed before the AKG K240 comes into it's own, I tried it.  I plugged in the headphones to my AVR and played music through them for 19 hours.  After coming home from work to see what they sounded like...well...wow!!  What a difference.  The mid and upper are now smooth and easy to listen to.  These aren't bass thumping headphones, but they sound warm, pleasant, clear, and natural.  You can enjoy listening for hours and not be fatigued.  A great sub $100 headphone.

0440244412|5.0|Last night I finished the Fever series. This series was beyond epic. I have to sing its praises to anyone that will listen to me. I started the series the beginning of last week. I would not have known about it if not for reading about it on a PNR blog. For me reading this series was as profound as seeing ET the first time. (yes, the extraterrestrial) I laughed, I cried, I cheered. I told my husband that I have to read it all over again. He was aghast. I had been planning on starting a different series but I think that will have to wait.    Halfway into the first book I was somewhat disappointed at the lack of sex in the story. If it had not been for a link to Jericho Barrons' POV on KM's website I would have likely quit at that point. The scene is not in any book but is between Jericho and MacKayla in her room at the B&B she stays at when she first arrives in Dublin. It is a moment in time wiped from Mac's memory by Jericho but in it there was plenty of sex.     Before reading the Fever series I knew some of the mythology the series is based on from The Mabinogion and other studies I've done of ancient pagan folklore. You might want to do a search on \\"the sidhe\\".    The song/charm of making \\"Anáil nathrach, ortha bhas betha, do cheol déanta.\\" is mentioned in the series but not actually recited by any of the characters. It was presented in the 1980 film \\"Excalibur\\". It is spoken in old Irish. Many translations are available on the internet. Just thought you might enjoy that little bit of info.
B0055CJ8T2|5.0|This is by far Kelly's best album. It shows her range and ability to sing anything. I actually like the variety and hate albums with the same type of songs. This album has a taste of R&B, Hip Hop and Pop. My favorite songs on the album are tracks 1-7. I like listening to this album over and over again unlike her other albums which I listened to a few times and put away. Way to go Kelly! I support you all the way.
B00004KD1L|5.0|I've owned this album since it came out and have listened to it consistently since then.  I wholeheartedly agree with all other reviewers who have said that this is a great album to just let play.  The pacing and order of the tracks is perfect.  More importantly, \\"Vertigo\\" has held up in a way that aging electronica, especially that which has enjoyed some fame, rarely does.  Beats and arrangements are still lush and rich, even in comparison to recent releases by \\"Groove Armada\\" and other similar artists.  For me, it's a real toss up as to which GA album is the best, but this one continues to beat out even \\"Soundboy Rock\\" in my opinion.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|I've seen this movie several times, and absolutely love it.    It's a cliché-less sci-fi experience, the choice of unknown actors is spot on, and the production is flawless.    More than that, the movie has some surprising authenticity to it. I had the opportunity of seeing it with a friend from South Africa, and she said she could spot the different accents from the different parts of Joburg. She also explained how there had been a District 6 in the time of Apartheid.    All in all, it's a good story, excellent effects and production, and downright thrilling to watch.
044654759X|5.0|This book is awesome! While I generally enjoy any N. Sparks book, this one had the suspense factor that sort of surprised me. I found myself thinking about situations and possible outcomes from the very beginning of the book. I was worried and hopeful for the characters. I could not put it down. It was a perfect blend of love, sorrow, hope, suspense and faith.<br />I have already recommended this book to many people and will continue to do so.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love a good logic puzzle, and this is a great logic game. Lots of achievements to keep me striving and one of the most soothing, listenable soundtracks of any game I have played. This was well worth the price!
B001C4CI8U|4.0|The DVDs arrived in great shape.  I started watching them right away.  These will be great on the cool wet nights to come.
B004T5R2HQ|1.0|All images on my evo shift are just big wavy colorful lines. This app has some promise if it can work on all platforms.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This is the best video ever.  I received it promptly.  It has been played too many times already by the grandkids and works wonderfully.
030788743X|5.0|There are already hundreds of reviews telling you to buy this book, but I'm going to add another one.  It's that good.  Imagine someone walking through your childhood memories, reminding you of the first time you played a video game, read a comic book or watched War Games.  That's what makes Ready Player One so worth reading.  It's not just a great story (which it is), it will make you rush to Wikipedia and You Tube and Netflix to watch old music videos and rent old movies that you forgot how much you loved.  It's just one huge nostalgia rush for kids of a certain age.    The plot of the book involves a boy named Wade who lives in a near future where we've run out of energy and spend most of our time indoors, plugged into a giant computer simulation called the Oasis.  If you've played a MMO like World of Warcraft, this is the evolutionary next step towards immersive gaming, except that due to the Mad Max atmosphere outside everyone spends their time there.  The founder of the Oasis dies, and leaves his fortune to whoever can solve a number of pop culture and video game riddles, all based on 80's geek culture.    It also works on another level though, which is tapping into the geekiness that you felt as an adolescent, and that you played video games as a way to \\"forget about life for a while.\\"  Wade is running away from reality both because it sucks on a global level, but also because he's a teenager who is shy around girls and not really sure how to relate to anyone who doesn't share his esoteric interests.  Ready Player One will tap into your inner teenager and remind you of the angst that you thought you had forgotten.  It's that good.    As an aside, this is also the first book that I read on an e-reader, which someone seems appropriate.  If e-readers were slightly more advanced, they would lend itself perfectly to a book like this.  How about music links so that whenever a song title is mentioned, you can touch it to play the song?  Or highlighting a movie titlequeued it for download or sent it to a rental queue?      However I found myself wondering if Mr. Cline would come through my town on a book tour, and how great it be to go meet him....except now I have nothing for him to sign.  And that made me sad and wistful at the same time.  What will be the point of book tours when we all have e-readers?  I would love to know Mr. Cline's thoughts on that.
B004G600A4|5.0|I had never seen this movie before.  It is very cute take on rapunzel.  My granddaughter watches it over and over.
0345529057|3.0|There is little fantasy in book one, A Game of Thrones.  It is mostly a palace intrigue.  Each chapter changes to the perspective of a different character.  For me, it is well told but a pretty straightforward struggle for power.  There is some violence done to children that I found distasteful.
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|Server software available for Windows, Mac and Linux. Easy to setup and use. Best if paired with a fast upload on the server end. Great app for the price of $2!
B000PMLFRA|1.0|just like with the 6-film set, the additon of the NOOOOOO in ROTJ ruins one of the best scenes in the entire series. previous changes i've been able to accept, even if i didn't like them, but this change fundamentally affects the whole film and the whole series that leads up to that moment. thanks to this change, my feelings toward this Blu-Ray release can be summed up in 3 words: DO NOT WANT
B002ZG975Q|5.0|bought it for my daughter and she loved it and wants one of her teachers to let them watch it in class
B003ZSJ212|1.0|i was eagerly anticipating buying this set, but NOOOOOOOOO longer. i can roll with the punches when it comes to SW, most of the changes that lucas has made over the years have been pointless, stupid, and distracting, but they are mostly fleeting moments i can overlook. but to take one of the most important scenes of the entire series, the scene where vader finally turns away from the dark side to save his son and redeem himself, and to ruin it with the single worst line reading in the entire series, that is where i draw the line. lucas can keep his precious SW series to tinker with and change as he sees fit; i'll keep my money in my wallet from now on.
B001EC3JME|5.0|i have this on my duty belt going on 2 years and it works great and for 10 bucks i paid for it i have zero complaints
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Sound, Picture, perfect! This Is the best transfer of these films I have ever seen. Now this is the last time I will buy this set because I dont know if you can get any better. The only hang up I have is alot of special features from past releases are missing. Thats ok because all us starwars fans have to do is keep the previous discs for the bonus stuff. All together with the blu rays it makes the ultimate collection. No kidding these films look and sound like they were filmed yesterday. Dont miss out on these discs because who knows when George will release them again.
B005CMGKTG|5.0|i have looked everywhere for this movie ,glad to have found it and it was worth the wait i love it
B003L77G8I|5.0|I didn't really like Hannah, but without Hannah, Booth and Bones would have remained stuck in their safe/comfortable relationship. Throughout the Hannah arc, you could see Bones' realization that she was losing Booth, really hitting her in \\"The Doctor in the Photo\\". I love the Booth and Bones relationship but it was nice to see Cam with a boyfriend and to see Angela and Hodgin's relationship evolve dealing with baby worries. Also, Jacob Broadsky's arc was pretty cool. Though some episodes weren't fantastic (which is typical for any tv show), the episodes that were great were really great (some of my favorites throughout the series). My favorites of season 6 included \\"Maggots in the Meathead\\", \\"Bullet in the Brain\\", \\"Blackout in the Blizzard\\", and the last three episodes. The \\"Signs in the Silence\\" was probably my favorite episode of the season. That episode and the season finale were the first two episodes I saw of the whole \\"Bones\\" series actually. If a couple of episodes from Season 6 could suck me into falling in love with \\"Bones\\" then it can't be that bad of a season. I saw a preview of the 1st episode of Season 7 and I'm very excited to see where the series will go next.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I was so upset when Han Shot first in the special edition dvd release of Star Wars because it killed his character arc in the film. He was a no good smuggler /mercenary that decided to finally do the right thing at the end of the film. I think we all get that by now. I have always been 50/50 on changes to the films over the years. Return of the Jedi was just fine the way it was. Changes was the Sarlacc Pitt conversation between Han and Lando. When Han is hanging upside down ready to shoot the Sarlacc Lando asks him \\"Now wait I thought you were blind?\\".....Han replied \\"Trust me!\\". That was the basis of their relationship. They didn't trust each other. That's how their relationship was left in Empire. Six years ago because they added more score to the sequence because of added elements and the line was changed to \\"No wait I thought you were blind?'....Han's reply....\\"Don't worry I can see much better now!\\". Once again this kills the character dynamic between their relationship. What is wrong with Lucas and killing his character development. Does he not know how to tell a story anymore? NOW fast forward to Blu-Ray. We do not need Vader explaining his position as he saves his son from being killed. The selfless act of destroying the Emperor to save his son with no words spoken said it all. The music conveyed the emotion and you could see on Vaders face/helmet for the first time someone who cared and wasn't evil...the transition as his character came full circle. I will not give Lucas another dime. This box set is an un-creative attempt to once again sucker all the fans into spending money once more. I encourage everyone to cancel your pre-order in protest and save your money until Lucas finally gives the fans what they want. The original untouched films.
6304696566|5.0|This isn't a \\"review\\" of the movie, it's a review of the service that sent me the DVD. The disk showed up quickly, is in great condition and was reasonably priced. What more could anyone ask?!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Will you never stop? I was at least considering getting the blu-ray versions. That was until news came of even more alterations. More of whatever it is you consider perfection. I used to fret at all the remakes and reboots of every other franchise out there like everyone else. Until I realized that our great originals still exist. But not in this case. You have stolen the originals, the classics from us. We'll never have them again. Or at least have them as we should. Suck it, Lucas. I'm going to watch Firefly.
B002KE47Z8|5.0|This book consists of 8 short stories. The first four are amazing, each grabbing me from the first page. The characters (many natives of India in America) come alive in these engaging stories. The fifth story was the only one that I did not connect with. The sixth, seventh, and eighth are all connected through the characters, with the final story being the best of that set. These relationship stories all ring true, and the writing is excellent. I strongly recommend them.
1579125549|5.0|The claim by so many chess writers that \\"the best way to improve your game is by playing\\" is sheer nonsense. I played a lot and lost continually in early high school without improving one bit. This is because I didn't know what the difference was between a good move and a bad one. Also, I had no idea why my oponents made the moves they did. Playing didn't make me better; it just made me give up the game until now. I'm 61 and have just discovered how to improve my game and thereby actually enjoy playing chess. The biggest improvement came after I began studying Polgar's \\"Chess: 5334 Problems...\\" The first thing Polgar taugh me was how to look at the entire board. I'm still working through this book and it contiues to be a help to me.<br /><br />The second book that has improved my play is Chernev's \\"Logical Chess, Move by Move.\\" It has helped me to discover the answer to the question, Why did my oponent do that?<br /><br />Now that I've learned what chess is all about -- beyond just moving pieces -- I can finally say that, yes, playing improves my game. But I would suggest, before playing yourself into frustration like I did, buy and study these two helpful books.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I don't think I have even watched all 6 movies. Don't care about Star Wars that much at all but I will rate this product 1 star just to protest with others against releases that don't include originals in them when they need to be there.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I've put up with the nonsense for too long. I've defended it and apologized for it. No more. Normally, I would not review something I haven't seen. But I know what's coming now, and it's a damn shame. Canceled my order.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|I absolutely loved the movie, going into knowing there are three different realities portraid definitely helped for the first time I watched it.    Its one of the few movies I'm able to watch over and over again. The extended cut should have been the original version without question. It ties everything together perfectly and gives a deeper insight into the movie.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|The games are typically fun and good time killers if you are waiting for someone, but after playing and beating the first 15 or so games, you either have to keep replaying those already beaten games over and over again to get enough points to unlock another game.  OR you can buy points from the company, OR you can give your contact information to some other company so they can direct advertise to you ad nauseum in order to unlock the games.  It would be an alright product if it didn't take forever to unlock the games after the first 15 or so without wasting a LOT of time or paying buku bucks.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, as will you. It's another great story from the Pixar team, and a worthy sequel in the Toy Story saga.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Pretty unbelievable George continues to knowingly screw over his fanbase.   Why, when it would be so easy, would you not at least, in the very least include the original versions of the movies?  1 star for being a deluded pompous ass. Loved the originals, but the new redone scenes and such quickly take me out of the movie and make me mad - they're almost as irritating as episodes I-III.
B000OT6V00|4.0|I've never been a fan of the Hellboy comics, but I did enjoy this movie for the most part. An above average cast and some very cool CGI didn't hurt at all.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Lucasfilm just confirmed they added Darth Vader screaming 'NOOOOOOOOOO!' just before throwing the Emperor down the well.  When will George learn to stop raping his babies?  [...]
B00003CXA2|5.0|This is one of my Top 5 favorite movies of all time, as I imagine it is for many people. It may seem almost cliche now, 17 years later...but think back to how much it touched your heart when you first saw it. Then enjoy it like you've never seen it.
B004G6009U|5.0|My DVD arrived on time, and in great condition! My kids love it, and I would definitely buy from this vendor again.
B001H5X7KC|5.0|...probably from laughing so hard. Brilliant movie with an outstanding cast. I couldn't stop laughing, even as the credits rolled.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|Received this in the correct time as stated. The grandkids love it. They always like getting stuff in the mail! Thanks amazon for the good job.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|I love all the Marvel Comics superheroes, but none more than Iron Man. Robert Downey Jr. gives an impressive performance (along with the rest of the cast) and the effects are eye-popping. Awesome movie.
B004R63MWQ|3.0|If you've seen the original, and it did not deter you from seeing this remake, you'll agree that it deserves a three star or more rating.  If you liked the original, this one has much better digital effects, of course, and to its credit, the story and acting aren't too bad.  For a genre (science fiction) that is typically lacking in both of these elements, Tron: Legacy is getting there.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|Classic Disney masterpiece, great Blu-ray digital transfer, fun extras. I was thrilled to see this movie as a kid, and it only seems to get better with age.
0674057929|5.0|Informative, deep analyis and fascinating to see Wilde's own annotations in the text. Highly recommended for a closer look at a classic.
B00005JMYI|5.0|Hilarious from start to finish, with a comedy dream team in front of the camera. I find this movie to be a source of endless one-liners. Ferrell's best charming idiot performance to date.
B0054N73EY|5.0|I'm said it before, but Amazon should only allow people who have actually bought the disc to post reviews.  Most of these reviews are obviously based on folks listening to samples on their crappy PC speakers.  I've listened to to it 6 times so far on my Acura's awesome BOSE system, and I am loving it.  I fell in love with the band in the spring of 1988 when they played an awesome outdoor show at U-Mass Amherst (Hillel blew my mind), and have been a loyal fan since.  With John gone, Chad and Flea stretch out more, and the new guitarist has a great, scratchy, atmospheric style.  He's not trying to copy Frusciante, which is a smart move.   He's also a multi-instrumentalist, and adds much more to this album than people are giving him credit for.   Keidis sounds the best he ever has.  Definitely more stylistically diverse than anything they've done before, and that's a good thing.  Great tunes.    F the critics!!!!
B000W1V7K4|4.0|They're still coming up with a few new jokes, but I hope this was the last \\"Ocean's\\" movie. The gag is getting a little thin, even with Pacino added to the mix.
0811874192|5.0|I bought this for my mother's 90th Bday and she and my dad seem to love it.  I was quite pleased to hear this. It's so hard to buy someone who is 90 a Bday present, after all what do they need?
B000069HZP|5.0|I love this movie...it's a non-stop murder mystery/thriller that leaves you guessing right up to the end. And then still manages to surprise you.
B0040JHXTI|5.0|What can we say but BRUUUUUCE!  This really lives up to it's promise and the remake of darkness was unbelievable!  I HIGHLY recommend it for any Boss collection!  RIP Clarence.
B004GXL8GC|3.0|I bought this for my lil girl because we saw the movie and she wanted smurfs lol. But there on the small side. The ones u get from mickey d's happy meal are better made and bigger. But if this is all u have avail, its better than nothing
B004HGBUVG|4.0|Lucinda still thrills but this is a departure from some of her others. More raw sounding and takes some getting used to due to the rockability of it.
0930289234|5.0|For many fans like myself, this book came out when I was too young to understand and appreciate it.  It wasn't until later in life when I started getting tired of the stereotypical super-hero comic book and got into more adult themed graphic.  Watchmen was the book that started it all for me; it got me interested in comics again and gave me a fresh taste of what the medium could deliver.  The quality of the art and the story-telling work together to draw readers into this alternate world where superheroes existed mostly as vigilantes dressing in costumes fighting (or causing) crime.  One of the benefits is the history of the book's protagonists. Moore draws upon philosophy and identifies with us with questions of what it means to put on a uniform and help people.<br />Read this and you won't regret it.  Fans of comics or not, this book is meant to be read by people who identify themselves as \\"intelligent readers\\". Forget the movies, books are where it's at.
B0002STNQ2|2.0|I feel as though I should start off by saying that I really like Michael Crichton. A few days ago, I borrowed this book up from a friend because I had a feeling power was going to go out (thanks hurricane Irene!) and I needed a good read to keep myself entertained. I am so sorry that I chose this book.    Part of what bothered me was the style of writing. It seemed as though a complete oaf was speaking! Every sentence was: I did this. Then I said. I went. I know. I..I..I!!! I WAS GOING CRAZY WITH THAT! And of course there were paragraphs where I didn't understand half of the words because I am not knowledgeable in nano technology...but those paragraphs I could handle. It was the dull sentences with lack of word choice that made me cringe.     And just so everyone knows, I'm love all types of novels. Some of my favorite have been light reads, so being deep is not a requirement. But writing in a captivating manner is.     Aside from the style of writing, the story didn't really hold my attention. At times I was totally into what was happening, and then the topic would change and my attention would go with it. It was really unfortunate because I soooo wanted to like this book!     Overall- my suggestion is to spare yourselves and NOT get it.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I had heard the people in control of the money - the ones who are enabling lucas to continue to keep trying to make the star wars saga a complete abortion - pay attention to the reviews on Amazon.  So I am giving this a 1 star review after having read and seen the new and \\"better\\" changes that lucas thought these films needed.    I think I'd be fully willing to pay any price for a regular dvd set of the original, UNALTERED in any way shape or form, episodes 4,5, and 6.  Seriously... instead of wasting your money on garbage please buy absolutely anything else.
B000683VI4|5.0|Love this movie so much I had to have a copy of my own, it is a movie about what is happening in our country as the population is aging, and its about a love, true love that never dies, the possibility of not knowing your spouse from one minute to the next would be devastating.  Well written and produced.
B004XDYJRU|2.0|While I love this app, and would have rated it a 4 or 5, I am lowering it to 2 because a recent update erased all of the saved station presets. What were the developers thinking, or were they thinking at all?
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Like an abusive spouse Lucas will hurt you again and again.  He won't change.  Luckily I am not a Star Wars fan anymore.  I grew up and realized that outside the space of my childhood even the OTrilogy aren't THAT great.  Please do not continue to make this hack rich.  Outside of some innovation in special effects shooting he is a no talent scrub who caught lightning in a bottle by retreading other movie tropes into the sci-fi genre.    He's not worth your geek angst.  Grow up and move on to REAL cinema not the consumerism as art that Star Wars is.  At one time it had some artistic weight (unlike say BayFormers), which makes the current state of this franchise all the more pathetic.  Save your money.  Or better yet buy a Blu-ray of The Godfather or Se7en.  Or if your into something more \\"pulpy\\"  Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown drop next month.  Leave Star Wars in your memories because it's present will continue to be a world of suck :-)
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Don't buy this set.  It's a disaster.  How much would I enjoy having the original trilogy on Blu-Ray?  A whole lot... but not this butchered mess.  Darth Vader 2011 screams \\"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\" before tossing the Emperor over the railing.  That's all you need to know.
B004NJW96C|4.0|This is a great album, if you actually know Moby's music.  A more ambient/downtempo album then his commerical \\"Play\\" type music, this is a throw back (IMHO) to the Moby of the late 90's. It reminds me a lot of his Everything is wrong, and Voodoo Child work. If you are looking for a late night driving soundtrack or something to listen to while studying than this is an album for you.
0061997811|5.0|I bought this book for a Harry Potter fan.  She loved all of the extras in the book.  She is between the ages of 25-30 and at first I was a little concerned, not being familiar with Harry Potter.  But she loved it and has added it proudly to her collection of all that is Harry Potter.  I would recommend this to any serious fan.
1586216880|5.0|Well written story covering his childhood through to his release.  Enjoyable and educational, even if you are not a history or politics buff.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|I was super-excited about the original films being released on Blu-ray......until the news arrived that Lucas was further altering them by adding new dialogue.<br /><br />While the whole \\"NOOOO!\\" sequence has been much-ballyhooed by viewers, it did somewhat fit in 'Sith.'  For 'Jedi'.....absolutely not.  The original scene, where Vader quietly watches Palpatine attempt to murder Luke and then has a change of heart, is so much more powerful in that Vader makes his decision in complete SILENCE.  Considering that Anakin is depicted as a hotshot motormouth in the prequels, it makes the silence of the original cut of 'Jedi' so much more powerful.  (And, while I'm at it on 'Jedi', why did Lucas have to change the music at the end?  Totally ruined my childhood memories of watching my battered old VHS.)<br /><br />Look, Mr. Lucas, as a writer/editor both in career and hobby, I can understand about creating something wonderful and then always wondering how it could have been made better.  Seriously, though.  Please stop.  You created an amazing fictional world that became bigger than anyone could have ever dreamed of.  It is a cultural phenomenon that has forever changed film and the lives of fans.  Why ruin a good thing?<br /><br />\\"This deal has been altered once.  Pray I don't alter it any further!\\"<br />Obviously, Mr. Lucas, we haven't been praying hard enough.
B004RKXN44|3.0|I had hoped to read this book as an easy, fun read. But by page 3, I was so overwhelmed with all the \\"telling\\" me how alpha he was and submissive she was, and with the umpteenth misused participial phrase, I threw the book across the room. How are we supposed to read this stuff? What happened to editors and copyeditors who know English grammar? They have my money now, but I wouldn't recommend this book unless you don't care about how well it's written. There are cheaper and better written books out there. Editors, get with the program. Edit.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Why Lucas, Why?  Why Mess with Perfection?  I can see you touching up cracks and dust on the original master, or adding a few tactful special effects here and there, but seriously?  I mean this killed it for me (from the BlueRay): [...].  Vader screaming NOOOOOO! as he chooses his son over the Emperor?  Also this?  [...]. I mean seriously, is there anything Lucas won't do to ruin his legacy?  I was ok with the re-releases of the OG Trilogy.  Sure the Mos Eisley spaceport became a little overwhelming and the Jabba's palace dancers were just plain wrong, but I had faith in the man.  Sure Greedo shooting first kinda took away from Han's swagger, but dammit, he was coming out with THE Prequels!!  Then, Episode I came out.  I waited in line like a lunatic for 4 hours on the first night.  Eagerly anticipating the movie after 16 years of waiting, I was stunned when I saw the final product.  Needless to say, Episodes 2 and 3 did nothing to restore my faith in the franchise.  And now, he further bastardizes the original trilogy with these ridiculous add-ons.  I implore you all to watch the YouTube scenes before shelling out $80 for this steaming pile!  Release the original, unedited versions on Blue Ray George!  DO NOT BUY THIS!!
B004NDJXOO|5.0|There are not that many movies like this anymore. It has a great storyline, can cater to anyone who feels like they're out of place, or alone in life. It's about time it came out on Blu-Ray too, what would be even better than that is if they fixed up the voice dubbing in certain scenes, and put extra scenes back in that were in the US TV Version. Even get Michael J. Fox himself, to make an Audio Commentary on the film. And also some featurettes on the making of the film. But i am very happy that a Timeless Classic has made its way home to Blu-Ray.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed GRRM's latest addition to the series.  Granted the wait is longer than fans of the series would like, this book does not disappoint.  GRRM gives readers what they have come to expect in this series, cliff hangers and unexpected plot twists.  Much better than the last book, which in my opinion was trudgingly slow and tedious.  Can't wait for the next book, just hope that it doesn't take more than 6 years this time!
B004US4K2C|3.0|I never really looked at any permissions before but why do they need to be able to delete stuff from my sd card? Also why do they need access to make phone calls? Idk seems a little fishy to me. Although like I said I don't normally check those things so maybe there is a reason for it.... I just don't know what it would be. If anyone can explain this to me I'll change my rating.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Ok, greedo shoots first.  Ok, the lightsaber is green.  Ok, most of the ships have a white box around them.  Ok, there is a dance number. Ok, the young Anakin shows up at the end of Return of the Jedi.  Ok George, you finally got me.  After defending Star Wars for years on end, you finally beat me.  If Darth Vader starts talking before he slam dunks the emperor I will not buy your blu-rays.  The part where he finally realized that Luke was right and there is good in him is the turning point of the trilogy (that's right trilogy).  I was willing to buy the 6 disk set for the deleted scenes alone, but the HD transfer was too much.  With the added dialog I will NOT buy them.  They are your movies and you can do what you want with them, but it's my money and I can do what I want with it.  Since you confirmed that this change is there, I'm keeping my money.  You have disappointed a big fan, and ultimately that is where you get your money.
B004C5M282|5.0|Ever since the first song I heard by Volbeat I have loved them! They are the perfect mix of punk, metal and rockabilly. This album is so powerful and energizing, I can't stop listening to it. I was fortunate enough to see them on the tour for this album and they were just as amazing live, I would definitely recommend checking them out!
B0054N73EY|5.0|Love this cd...yeah it's not your old Chili Peppers, but it's great and it stands on its own. Josh Klinghoffer is an awesome addition!
B004T5K3OK|5.0|This is a top five must have app. Its so much more than &quot;just a camera app&quot;.  For two bucks its awesome.
B002ZG99CC|2.0|I'll start this by saying that I have not seen the original film yet (OMG, are you serious) and so my judging of this film has no nostalgia clouding better judgment.  In other words, I don't like this more because of seeing the original, nor have I walked into watching this pre-judging it thanks to being a fan of the original.  As far as I was concerned, this was just another movie.<br /><br />I have a few issues with this film, some of them rather severe, and I will say that while I found it somewhat entertaining and enjoyable (in parts), this was an overall failure in many ways.  Like I said, I have not seen the original, and maybe it fails in the same areas and so this `remake' can blame its predecessor for negative influence, but judging this solely as an individual film I have to say that it just did not work.<br /><br />The film tells the story of young Dre Parker.  We are told in a gimmicky manner that his father dies when he was nine.  He's twelve now.  His mother gets transferred to China (from Detroit, mind you) and so the film opens with Dre and his mother traveling across the world.  Dre is your typical pre-teen kid, and so the move is hard for him, but it doesn't really rear that ugly of a head until he expresses an interest in Meiying.  Soon, young Cheng (an angry child if I ever saw one) begins to bully Dre to the point where Dre fears even remote contact with the boy.  It turns out that Cheng is being trained in Kung-Fu by a brutal teacher and so Cheng feels that mercy is a weakness; thus the relentless beatings he exacts on Dre.  Seeing the torment that Dre is undergoing, a maintenance man named Mr. Han offers to train Dre so that he can fight in a turn tournament.  Obviously, he has his fair share of `wax on wax off' (in this instance it's `put on jacket, take off jacket') but soon Dre starts to learn the discipline and technique needed to beat up other children (yes, I'll get to that in a minute).<br /><br />I don't know how the original ended (although I read a seeming spoiler in one review of this version that leads me to believe it ended far more earnest and realistic than this one) but I must say that I hated this ending.<br /><br />I don't really know where to begin.  I could start with Jaden Smith, but I don't want to sound mean.  I won't say that he is a bad actor, especially since he has a lot of his father's expressions and I think Will Smith is a truly underrated actor.  I also thought that Jaden was the BEST thing about `The Pursuit of Happyness', so it's obvious that he has talent.  I will say this about the pre-teen Smith though; he is far too aware of his celebrity to pull off a natural performance.  He was laced with a constant mugging of the screen that was off-putting and too `put on', as if he was too confident in his ability or at least his stardom to really `act'.  This was stripped away to a degree as the film progressed, but he couldn't quite step away from his own reflection long enough to feel real to me.  Next, the film is far too long for its own good.  It could have edited out a good thirty minutes and still been entertaining, probably even more so.  This is not the type of film that requires a running time of more than two hours; believe me.  Like I said, that ending was terrible.  You build for so long this constant presence of hatred and unreasonable intolerance in a character like Cheng only to strip it away completely in a timespan of three seconds.  It makes no sense and is absolutely pointless, if only to create a faux happy ending for this `kids flick'.<br /><br />Speaking of `kids flick'; this is not.  I'm actually appalled that this film is only rated PG.  It is horrendously violent and mean spirited throughout a lot of the film.  Don't dare label me a prude, because I am far from it, but this film is targeted at young ones and contains countless sequences of pre-teen children beating each other senseless.  I mean, they are beating each other in the face and attempting tobreak each other limbs.  If the film starred Jet Li it would be rated R.  The character of Cheng is particularly repulsive, but his teacher is even worse (when he instructs Cheng to break Dre's leg I was flabbergasted that this film existed).<br /><br />Uck, but at least Jackie Chan finally proves that he can act (wow, best performance of his career) and Taraji P. Henson is seriously the light of my life; so there's that.  Honestly, they should have scrapped this whole project and just cast Henson as a young widow traveling to China to find herself only to fall in love with a reclusive maintenance man who has a troubled past and a tendency to destroy newly remodeled vehicles.<br /><br />I'd watch that before watching this again.arred Jet Li it would be rated R.

B0054N73EY|4.0|While this sounds like the Chili Peppers, at the same time it doesn't sound like THE Chili Peppers. Long gone are the heavy, in your face funk rock jams with big hooks and soaring guitar work. Long gone is the Sex from the Blood Sugar Sex Magick equation. But something about this new album still works in a very big way. The departure of John Fruciante on guitar has left a serious hole in the usual RHCP sound. But the addition of Josh K. has added a new sound to the band, and his guitar work, while subtle the majority of the time, is outstanding on this album. I didn't want to rate the album immediately. I knew this batch of songs would take a few spins to fully comprehend. But after many listens, I can say that I really enjoy this album. I think alot of thought and feeling was put into these songs. If there's anything it's lacking, it's energy at times. But these guys have been trucking it for nearly 25 years and cranking out great music over and over again. They've grown up and evolved. They aren't running around with socks on their wangs anymore. They have families and kids of their own. So this new sound is something I almost expected and welcomed. It's nice to see a slightly different side to these guys. I think this album has a lot of depth, and is very well done. I can't say that there is a bad song on the album, because there isn't. I definitely recommend this album, but just remember, you may not be able to wrap your head around their new sound on the first listen. Give it a few spins, let it sink in, and hopefully you will enjoy it as much as I do. Overall 4.5 Stars
B000PMLFRA|1.0|This review also applies to the Saga set, as the main concerns deal with the Original Trilogy material.  DO NOT BUY.  read on...    While I knew George was not going to give us the unaltered original trilogy (he's been saying this for years) on blu-ray, I was at least hopeful that this blu-ray set would be similar in film content to the special editions we got in 1997 (getting rid of the Hayden addition and so on in the 2004 DVDs).  Realistically though, we knew Mr. Lucas couldn't help himself from tinkering with the films even more.  BUT, with the changes he has added now, he's gone too far.  There are silly CGI additions that create continuity errors (R2D2 hidden in a pile of boulders now) and over-the-top audio changes (Krayt dragon, etc.).  The killer though, is the addition of NoooOOOoooOOo.  This scene was probably one of the most important moments in the entire saga.  Vader's silent actions sent chills down your spine.  Now, Lucas has decided to add NoooOOoooOOOooooo to the scene.  It even covers up Luke's desperate pleas to his father.    Sorry George, but this is it. NO DEAL.  It's fine and dandy if you want to continue to play with your films, but do not erase history.  Make all versions available, most importantly the theatrical.  Future generations need to know the original films.  Your colleagues can do it (see Blade Runner), so why can't you.    DO NOT BUY THIS SET! Demand that Lucasfilm gives us the set we deserve.
B0015D3Z4O|4.0|Well, I meant that Madonna's body is really buff like granite so much so that her ex Guy Richie freaked out.<br /><br />I suspect that Her Madgesty is a gay man trapped in a real woman's body. Over the years, she has played the male role in concerts and photo shoots. Watch her Sticky And Sweet Tour. Check out 4 Minutes where her costume makes her look like a football jock. Also, in Hung Up she plays heavy metal guitarist. Wow, so man.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by the cover. She's not issuing a sexual invite but is displaying her humongous family jewels metaphorically. And gosh, who styled her? Madge resembles a female wrestler. And who chose the most unflattering shots for the inside pages?<br /><br />Alright, where the music is concerned she went from one big round from her debut to reach square one again. This album reminds me of Lucky Star/Burning Up/ Physical Attraction. It is very black one.<br /><br />Hard Candy is actually nice as the heavy RnB grooves can stick with you  after some listens. Expect pretty decent songs like Candy Shop, Give It To Me, Heartbeat and 4 Minutes. Dance 2Night reminds me of the first album very much. It's like a Deja Vu. She's Not Me is rather tiresome as it drags on for far too long.<br /><br />Normally, I buy her CDs as soon as they drop. In the case with Confessions On A Dance Floor as well as Hard Candy, I waited a year before picking them up. I think these two albums as well as American Life are more of musical diversions while her earlier releases are pretty essential classics.

B000PMLFRA|1.0|I was one of the biggest Star Wars fans ever (I was 7 years old in 1977).  And I've been waiting for Star Wars on Blu Ray since Blu Ray came out.  But I will not buy these movies now that Lucas has messed with them so much.  If he removes Darth Vader saying \\"NOOOOOOOOOO\\" at the end of ROTJ, I will consider buying them, but until then there's no chance he's getting any more of my money.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|If people are really stuck on the original, ebay has the old VHS's for very cheap. If you want better quality of the original, watch the DVD that was released a few years ago. The first three movies are three of the most enjoyable movies ever made! I don't understand Greedo shooting first either, but I really don't mind all off the other changes made. Lucas made this thing we've all been obsessed with since we were little kids, if he wants to \\"improve\\" his story, I say go for it. It's not going to ruin it for me if an Ewok blinks two times. Can you really give this collection such poor ratings when we're finally getting to see all of these really cool deleted scenes that we've heard rumors about for 30 years? Look at the big picture people. This is Star Wars, finally on Blu-Ray.
B0052YAKS6|1.0|I was born and raised in the South Bronx where hip hop and rap started and this guy is ruining this style of music and this CD is too commerical for my taste, and there is nothing aspiring about it. I saw this guy at the 2011 Electric ZOO festival and it look like he was faking it and plus he added a corny sample of the Legend of Zelda he tried to play trance but failed. When this guy decides to write his own music and create his own beats then he will be something someday.   He needs to quit hanging out with these hip hop and rap artists, I heard a few tracks and this is not worth buying. I have seen and heard how hip hip and rap is revolving but this guy GUETTA needs to take lessons from Armin Van Buuren, Paul Van Dyk, COSMIC GATE and Above and Beyond to learn how to mix Electronic Dance Music or at least do a better job incorporating hip hop pop into Electronic Dance Music. There is no substance to his remixes AVENNCI track is alot better and he did a remix for ARMIN VAN BUUREN's which is better than anything this guy puts out. All the trance DJ's that I mentioned could remix these hip hop and rap records better than GUETTA and it would not be just a 3 and a half minute song it would be anywhere from 6 to 7 minutes long.  I have been listening to electronica for over 35 years (I stopped listening to rap and hip hop a long time ago) and trance for about 12 years and this is what hip hop and rap could offer then that style of music is in trouble.  GUETTA, SWISS BEATS and Dr. Dre are only producers while the DJ's I just mentioned are both.  They put more effort and creativity in their remixes, this is why trance comes out with more remixes than you can count.  If you do not believe me just go to the website called  A STATE OF TRANCE so you can hear what a remix suppose to sound like.
0385342055|3.0|I'm a fan of the series, so I enjoyed this book. I found myself smiling as Becky's parents argued over the fastest way to contact their neighbor Janice, texting her (Mum) or doing it old school and shouting over the fence (Dad). The Bloomwoods and their silly, stupid arguments are always endearing. And I love Becky's indefatigueable spirit. Yes, she's silly, too. But her heart is true and her optimism is inspiring. I like Luke and Minnie, too. Danny, Suz and Tarquin all make return appearances.     The end was completely unbelievable. The grand event, the culmination of all Becky's schemes, was just ridiculous. But up until the very end, I got a lot of pleasure out of this latest Shopaholic adventure.

Change whatever you like Lucasfilm, but until you give the fans what we want you won't see another cent of my money. I really hope you take a bath on this.
0307346609|3.0|Max Brooks has put together a documentary-style account of the \\"zombie wars\\" which offers much in the way of \\"verisimilitude\\" - writer's jargon for realism - in a manner that unfolds like a sprawling journalistic endeavor (impressively so) - but which offers only spotty drama. If you're looking for a book that takes a sympathetic set of characters and plunges them into conflict, causing us to identify with them and worry about them at every turn, engrossing you in an unfolding narrative... then look elsewhere. This doesn't go as we expect in popular, dramatic fiction. It moves from interviewee to interviewee in a manner that, while smartly written and realistic, is choppy. There's no one in sight that we get to know, like, and care about. The book offers accounts of zombie action only here and there. And when it does, since we know little about the character describing the account, it's hard to care that much about the outcome. There is an account of a skirmish in Yonkers, New York, involving heavy artillery and a good deal of description which, in itself, is very good but fails to draw you in. I felt like I'd finally hit pay dirt, the pay-off for all the heavy-lifting Brooks performed in the first few parts of the book, and yet it did nothing for me because, again, I didn't care about anyone in the book. I listened to the audio version, which has the added benefit of top-rate actors to bring things to life and yet I found myself wondering how far in I was, when the chapter would end so I could switch to something more engaging. I really wanted to like this book. After all I paid for it, got caught up in the enthusiastic reviews, but I have to conclude that it must be a subjective thing - you'll either be drawn in by these disparate documentary-style accounts - or you won't. To scratch the itch for zombie fiction, I'll be looking for something with a more conventional dramatic structure. One can compare this with the movie, District 9, which (like WWZ) established its world with a bunch of documentary style clips. But District 9 wisely introduces us to our hero rather quickly. WWZ does not, and that's where it fails for me. Let's face it, if the Z wars ever come, we're going to need a hero to guide us through it. But, alas, there's none to be found in Brooks' Zombie Opus, so why should we care?<br /><br />P.S. - I caught wind recently that they're making WWZ, the movie. I guarantee the film version will be reworked, reshaped into the dramatic structure that I found wanting in the book. If they do, I'll feel vindicated in my criticism here. We'll see. Hopefully, it premiers before the first outbreak.ts world with a bunch of documentary style clips. But District 9 wisely introduces us to our hero rather quickly.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|After 30 of believing in the characters, the vision, and the mythology I can no longer claim to be a Star Wars fan.  I am so disappointed in the direction these movies have gone in the last few releases, with the ever misguided tinkering from Lucas.      The only thing that can redeem this set, the saga as a whole, and my faith in these once great movies is a re-release of the original trilogy, with cleaned up visuals (no added scenes or effects, just a clean print) and 5.1 audio.  Lucas has to be sitting on this because the mid 90's widescreen VHS release was close to this very thing.    Such a shame.  Lucas should be taking a cue from the awesome Blade Runner blu-ray release from a few years ago.  That's how you pay homage to a piece of cinematic history.  Not with this heavily modified piece of garbage.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|George Lucas continues to tinker with his films yet again.  Adding even more out-of-place CGI to decades old films and making other unnessecary changes while failing to fix obvious technical flaws...  And all of this while continuing to suppress (& allowing to rot away) the original versions of these historic films that started it all.  If other classic and much older films like Metropolis and The Wizard of Oz can be restored; and films like Superman 2, Blade Runner, and Close Encounters can have multiple cuts released so veiwers can choose which version to watch, why can't Star Wars?  It's time for Lucasfilm to restore & preserve the orginal films that changed history and became an instant legend.  This has just gotten ridiculous.    If you'd like to know more about the various changes the films have been through, as well as the current state of things, check out savestarwars.com.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|After viewing the changes on the blu-ray set on movies.com, youtube.com, etc. I had decided to cancel the upcoming blu-ray set of the Star Wars Saga.  It is disappointing to see the continued tinkering of this one-time masterpiece by the creator himself.  It is truly insulting to the dedicated fans of the original films to receive another revised edition of this set, and not be given the original copy of the trilogy to satisfy the hardcore fans of the unaltered editions.  It was not hard to cancel my pre-order.  The blu-ray set is just another edition to make more money out of the desperate fans who want to see it on high-definition.  Thanks George for making it easy to cancel my order and save money LOL
B003ZSJ212|1.0|In 1978, Star Wars was nominated for 10 academy awards (including best picture, best screenplay, best supporting actor, etc.) ultimately winning 7 including awards for editing, sound mixing, and special effects. The AFI lists \\"Star Wars\\" as #15 on its list of all time greatest films.  Make no mistake, this isn't just a fun romp, it is a very significant and important film.  Understand that the version in this box set is NOT that version, but a version that has been largely painted over with 21st century computer graphics, does NOT include the academy-award-winning sound mix, and with many different and more recent editing decisions. On this version, the effects and edits you see may be from 1977, or they might be from 1997, or maybe 2004, or maybe 2011... they might be the original academy-award-winning animatronics of Stears Dykstra, Edlund, and McCune that have never been equaled, or they might have been replaced by dated-looking 1990s computer-graphics, or they might be new things that were thrown in a couple of months ago. The choice of scenes and editing of those scenes might be the academy-awarding winning ones made by Paul Hirsch and Marcia Lucas, or they might be newer ones made by people who are preparing the movie for future 3D-a-rama. The glorious academy-award-winning sound mix by MacDougall, West, Minkler and Ballhas remains unavailable and has been replaced here by a yet another new one, and into which the young remixer even inserted his own voice.  In short, this release not only fails utterly to preserve a major artifact of our cinematic heritage, it goes further in that its producer has made it clear that he will never allow that seminal work to be accurately preserved.  This is not simply a bad product, it is a serious blow to art history and to our popular cultural heritage.
0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games was recommended to me as a Sci-Fi book.  I don't usually read that genre but was departing for a long plane trip and thought I'd read it on the flight.  Well, I finished the whole book during the flight. A quick read, well told and you can almost feel the 'make believe' location where it takes place. It was very interesting and imaginative.  I was told it was a young adult book but I think it is good for all of us older adults as well.  I think you will enjoy this book!
B0054N73EY|4.0|I'm With You is a very good album from a very great band. Frusciante is gone, but Klinghoffer is a generous enough replacement. He is no John, but he isn't supposed to be. (Am I the only one who believes that Frusciante was not right for this band, but is better suited to his own solo work? I wish John Frusciante all the best.)    I might add that this album has some of the coolest bass lines I have ever heard from the Chili's. So many of the songs are groovy, like the opener Monarchy of Roses, Factory of Faith, and Even You Brutus?. Other standouts include Police Station, Look Around, and the absolutely wonderful Brendan's Death Song.    It's not perfect, it's no Blood Sugar Sex Magick, but whatever, it's catchy, groovy, and plain awesome, and deserves 4 stars (or maybe 4.5!)
0743244257|3.0|Delillo's prose is a religious experience. Read the first two pages of Cosmopolis and you'll see what I mean.<br />The novel revolves around 24 hours in the life of Eric Packer, a 28 year old Wall Steet currency trader on a day when he is wagering all of his fortune, as well as the fortunes of others, on a falling Japanese Yen. Sounds simple and it should be. But Delillo casts a noxious spell as he transports the reader, along with Packer, his bodyguards, wife, numerous girlfriends, acquaintances, and a stunning white stretch limo through the bowels of a fictitious, yet not unimaginable Manhattan, on a spring morning in 2000 before the greed of the late '90s as well as Wall Street's credibility were forever lost.<br />The characters, including protagonist Packer, are exaggerated and unsympathetic to the point that it's difficult to relate to any them let alone care what happens to them. Yet, for all its Nietzesque atmosphere, I would recommend reading Cosmopolis, and reading it again and again. The novel is about doubt, and that's a very human, non existentialist emotion which Delillo exploits brilliantly.<br />As one of the author's shorter works, Cosmopolis may be a good place to start for those unfamiliar with Delillo's work. I'd prefer to give this novel 3.5 stars because it's better than neutral, while not being really great. Sadly, that's not an option here, so I'll just say I do recommend it even though I don't love it.  It's definitely worth at least one read.<br />Finally, Cosmopolis has recently been made into a film. It will be interesting to see how it translates to celluloid.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|Revising film history should be a crime.     As many other reviews have stated, Lucas has once again tinkered with his once classic films to make them more \\"thematically complete\\" with the terrible prequels. In yet another stupid change, Vader now yells \\"NOOOOOOOOOOOO!\\" when he throws the Emperor down the shaft at the end of Return of the Jedi. He does this to match up with the end of Revenge of the Sith, which was one of the most comically awful moments of the entire prequel trilogy, which is saying something. This does not add anything. Instead, it turns a powerful, cathartic, climactic scene into one that is on the nose and inert and now brings to mind the hilarious terribleness of the end of Episode III. It's a joke. It is borderline blasphemy and very much in line with all of the other awful changes Lucas has made to these films over the last 14 years.     And there are some other, minor changes that are just annoying and serve no purpose. They all seem small and silly by themselves, but they add up. It's gotten to the point where it's barely the same trilogy anymore.    The real point is this: Yes, George Lucas created and owns this franchise. Yes, he is technically and legally allowed to do whatever he wants with them. But he shouldn't be allowed to. The original versions of these movies are some of the most important films ever made. They have changed people's lives. They revolutionized special effects. They are culturally significant works of art. They are a testament to the power of the medium of film as a whole. And George Lucas has taken those movies away and replaced them with these bastardized versions that are objectively worse in just about every way. NO ONE, not even the creator/owner of said work of art, should be allowed to do that.      Star Wars coming out on blu ray should be a very happy occasion. Instead it's a very upsetting one.

B001PPLIEQ|5.0|I have often wondered why this film received such bad fan reviews, with many individuals calling it \\"mediocre\\" at best.  When I watched the film the first time, I thought it was a good Bond film, and that Daniel Craig did a good job.  When I watched it the second time, I thought that it was probably a VERY good Bond film, and that Daniel Craig did an outstanding job.  After the third and fourth times, I realized that this is one of the very BEST Bond films ever made, and that Daniel Craig can stand shoulder to shoulder with any actor that has ever played Bond.  The greatness of this movie is that we can see Bond evolving into the Bond that is portrayed in the books, which is a man that is an easy killer at times, and consummate, manipulative lady's man when required.  The pain of his lost love shines through the great acting of Craig.  Even more deeply, Craig effectively displays the guilt Bond carries because of the extreme hatred and animosity he harbored for Vesper's memory after her death, and the motivation for the quick kills and lack of mercy in regards to preserving \\"leads\\" to the organization \\"Quantum\\".  I read a review that called Bond in \\"Quantum of Solace\\" \\"not just a blunt force weapon, but no more than a baseball bat.\\"  I find this a shallow and uninspired description of Bond in \\"Quantum\\".  James Bond in \\"Quantum\\" is a sensuous executioner who is moving toward a goal and, knowing that the organization \\"Quantum\\" caused the death of the woman he loved/still loves, he will step over and through anyone who gets in his way to make them pay.  It just so happens that his duty to his country is aligned to his personal cause, otherwise, I believe Bond would have simply gone after them alone.  He would have killed them all, too.  Daniel Craig pulls Bond off perfectly.  I am excited about Bond 23 already.    The other character players in the film are on an even keel with Craig, and support the story perfectly.  As was mentioned in other reviews, one of my favorite scenes, though a bit short, is the gunfight in the restaurant at the opera house.  The tragedy of the situation is played and matched perfectly to the music, and the end of the fight, which results with a member of Special Branch being dropped off the roof by Bond, again displaying Bond's perfect coldness and lethality, is about the best end that could have been written.  The death of Strawberry Fields with the nod to \\"Goldfinger\\" by covering her in oil is a wonderful touch, and the maniacal side of Greene is displayed to perfection during the fight in the desert hotel, with him screaming and swinging an axe like a madman, and even laughing when he believes Camille is dead.  The heartbroken admission of Bond in the final sequence when he admits that M was right about Vesper displays the humanity of Bond once again, and the viewer knows that he is willing to move on as he tosses Vesper's necklace into the snow.    This movie is a wonderful addition to a long line of great movies about one of the greatest characters ever invented and put to film.  Reports say that Craig has signed on for five films total.  Hopefully, he will stay for more.
B0050PLT8W|1.0|Where do I even begin with Theory of a Deadman's sickening fourth offering The Truth Is? A lot of people comment that Nickelback is the worst radio-rock band, because they write about woman and how good they look, evident on THEIR record Dark Horse. This record takes a similar fall, but in all honesty, it's worse than Nickelback's. At least Nickelback's album has songs that actually like girls. I don't really get offended by explicit content (even though I only buy edited albums), but Theory of a Deadman takes this WAY too far, especially on three uninspired tracks: B---- Came Back, the title track, and to a lesser extent, Love Is Hell.<br /><br />\\"B---- Came Back\\"'s chorus is pointless and repetitive by repeating the title three to four times, and the verses are absolutely cringe-worthy. Also added is a bunch of useless profanity, which makes the situation even more maddening. The title track is among of the worst songs I've ever heard in my life. It takes woman-bashing to a whole new level, and it DOESN'T WORK! Note to TOAD: girls do not lie as much as it says on this song! Whoever thought that this song would even be written, let alone have it be the title of the album, really needs to be evaluated.<br /><br />I also find some of the songs to sound very similar. \\"Lowlife\\", the two tracks I hate, \\"Gentleman\\", and \\"Villain\\" (B-Side) all have the same beat, and even though the songs are played in different keys, it still doesn't help. Finally, Howard Benson of course is at the helm of production on this record, and it barely tries to make anything better. There are only two songs I can stomach off of the entire album: \\"Out of My Head\\" and \\"Careless\\". Other than that, this record is just TRASH. Even worse than \\"Cinco Diablo\\" by Saliva, which I also didn't like.<br /><br />The women-hating and profanity found on this record is just PUTRID. \\"The Truth Is\\", simply put, is a amazingly terrible album to listen to. Theory of a Deadman should be ashamed of themselves for coming up with this material- OH WAIT! They aren't. They keep making this type of music so that people will start hating on women more and forget that women are people, too. Sorry, but I'm so mad at this album, I had to make that small rant about it. For actual good rock music, I have to recommend \\"Welcome\\" by Taproot, \\"Anthem for the Underdog\\" by 12 Stones, \\"Diamond Eyes\\" by Deftones, \\"Innocence and Instinct\\" by Red, \\"South of Sideways\\" by Edgewater, \\"Year of the Spider\\" by Cold, and \\"Holding Onto Strings Better Left To Fray\\" by Seether. This disc needs to be used as wood for a fireplace on a cold winter night.<br /><br />Rating: Negative stars/5 starsming up with this material- OH WAIT! They aren't.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|George Lucas does nothing but destroy his own legacy by adding changes that are completely unnecessary. I consider myself a really big star wars fan and a huge blu ray fan. I never fully accepted the changes he's made to the films since 1997 and 2004 but to just have a better quality version of the film I caved in and bought them. For this blu ray release, I simply refuse. The changes he's made actually cheapen and disgrace the films and if people continue to buy this then you're only validating Lucas's actions. It's a waste of money and I truly hope you save yours until he finally gets the point to release the original versions and not keep cheating people with these versions.
B001OQCV6K|4.0|Good Action sequences and nice pacing through out the movie. This movie delivers a nice contemporary interpretation of Sherlock Homes. Looking forward to the sequels.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|With the changes made to the classic movies all I can think of to say is \\"Nooooooo!\\"     For those who don't know what has been changed here is a link
B000UJ48UO|4.0|Get your mind out of the gutter. It was my first War and/or military theme movie that I saw back in the day. The movie illustrates a man's journey from initiation in the Marine Corp to combat in the Vietnam. The movie takes an entertaining and sobering look at America's Vietnam experience.
B001QTXM5Y|5.0|The way Tarantino works in a revivisionst, alternative WW2 in INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS Snyder works in an alternative 1980's. WATCHMEN would have to be one of the definitive graphic novels to film. Along with BATMAN BEGINS, THE DARK KNIGHT, SIN CITY, X-MEN 2 X-MEN UNITED and the impressively underrated X-MEN FIRST CLASS would have to be the elite example on how to translate the graphic novel to film. WATCHMEN has a subversive subtext in how Western society is in need of natural resources with the twin towers constantly in the background throughout the film. The interpretation one can come up with is the need for endless natural resource that Ozymandis constantly refers to would wipe out wars. One could see that to mean that the United States had manipulated the collapse of the twin towers to invade for oil in Middle Eastern countries. The way Ozymandis triggers a nuclear detonation in New York is practiculary saying the United States conspired in the collapse of the twin towers. Those messages are there if one chooses to look hard enough below the stunning imagery of this film. Dr Manhattan would have to be the most tragic superhero commited to film. The director's cut is a more satisfying version as scenes are extended and new scenes added to the film. This is a hard nihilistic film that plays it strong when it comes to uncompromising violence that gives it credibility and appeal to people on the fringe of a desperate society.
B005KGPC4S|5.0|Two fantastic plot twists that you will not see coming.  A tight 90 minutes.  Not one minute wasted.  John Goodman is fantastic.  Definitely worth the $9.99 Rental Fee.
B001DSNF8C|5.0|Martin Campbell has reinvented the Bond franchise with an extremely convincing and intense Daniel Craig. The way Christopher Nolan reinvented the BATMAN franchise Campbell has done the same with Bond. Campbell and writer Paul Haggis have made an entertaining, serious John Le Carre spy story with some of the greatest, masterful action set-pieces ever seen. Instead of Soviet Cold-War villians we get the free-market, bankers and western corporations as the stand-out villians. Corporations that are willing to deal with the Right or Left, dictators or liberators as long as these corporations get their end. This is a more complex Bond dealing with more complex motivations then the camp and cartoon elements of previous Bonds. If only the disappointing MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE movies had been this good and ambitious.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|I am so disappointed, something I was looking forward to has been destroyed by the \\"fixing\\" of one of cinama's most dramatic scenes ever.  Sorry Lucas, I wont be sinking my hard earned money for this.  Ill download the bootleg HD versions from the web and burn my own.  I just cancelled my pre-order.
B0000DETET|5.0|More Classic stuff available, Thanks to Amazon, You guys bring it all back right to my door step. What can I say its VENOM ,   gotta have it, play it loud......
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Note to reader: Just because a review doesn't hold the same opinion as your own, doesn't mean it's unhelpful. The button reads \\"helpful\\" or \\"unhelpful,\\" not \\"agree\\" and \\"disagree\\"!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />So, this is what the big deal is? Darth Vader crying out \\"No\\" when he throws the Emperor into the reactor? Some of you fanatics really need to get over it and learn how to be a child again. I don't think that the new addition is that bad at all. I think it makes the scene better in my opinion and can understand why Lucas added it. This is the moment that Vader regains his humanity, through his son, and I believe that it should be not only expressed with action but with words. The only reason why, i believe, most of you dislike the new addition is because it reminds you of the scene from \\"Revenge of the Sith.\\"  That scene gets an unfair wrap from people just because it quickly cuts to the next scene, making Vader's cry feel slightly awkward. It's funny, because no one says anything about a similar awkward cut that was in \\"Empire\\" when Yoda says, \\"there is another,\\" it quickly jumps to the next scene, I remember viewing that and being like , \\"Wait, what did he just say?!\\" I wish they would have stayed on Vader when he cried out \\"No\\" and made him fall to his knees, so that the viewer could take it in, same with the Yoda scene. My point is this: this has been happening in Star Wars and I STILL LOVE IT! People need to relax and instead of rejecting the new additions try and see why Lucas, the artist, included it. I like the new dialogue as stated above.<br /><br />I won't even go into the blinking Ewok eyes or the new Obi Won cry because those changes are so minor to me. I could care less but some of you people who are upset about that are borderline cynical and neurotic.<br /><br />And the whole film Connoisseur attitude that some of you have is too much. The Criterion Collection has numerous classical films with multiple versions, such as Orson Wells \\"Mr. Arkadin,\\" with some versions better than the other as far as image quality, and you don't hear Orson fans complaining. They appreciate the multiple versions. You film connoisseurs talk about art but who are you?! You are not an artist, you're a spectator. Lucas is the artist and no matter how much you complain, you still love him. Lucas is the least mean spirited guy in all of film making, unlike someone like James Cameron, yet you hate him with a passion. It's sad because when he passes away you'll all be crying and thanking him.<br /><br />I also don't understand all the complaining regarding image quality, even for the dvd sets!! I recently just watched the OT on my HDTV and PS3 and I thought it looked great and this is just DVD! I read a lot of complaints about the quality and it just makes me shake my head like you people don't appreciate anything.<br /><br />Then there's the never ending complaining of not having the original theatrical versions in high quality DVD or included on this Blu Ray. Look, Lucas released the theatrical versions on DVD already!! Okay they were released in 4:3 Letterbox but guess what? There's such thing as \\"Zoom\\" on your TV, you know! I like the SE versions of \\"Empire\\" and \\"Jedi\\" but not \\"Hope\\" because i like the notion of Han shooting first and the Jabba scene is unnecessary, so guess what? I bought the limited edition DVD with the theatrical version as a bonus! All I do is zoom in and boom! Everything is fine. Sure the image is grainy when there are white backgrounds but i think it gives it an edge. You people expect Lucas to go out of his way and restore the originals but he never promised that!!!! you should be happy he did what he did because if he didn't all you would have is VHS and that would really suck.  It's you crazy fans that are being selfish, not Lucas.<br /><br />So when I get the Blu Ray versions I'm just going to switch out the SE version of \\"Hope\\" and replace it with the limited edition theatrical version. I'm a \\"happy camper!\\" I also like to add that I think it's awesome that Lucas fixed the puppet Yoda in \\"Phantom.\\" Thanks Lucas!<br /><br />And while I'm at it I might as well defend the hated prequels. Look, the whole point of \\"Phantom\\" was to show that no one is born evil. Some of you people want to view Vader as pure evil but that's not how life is. even Hitler was a baby! Even he was innocent at some point but most people don't want to admit that. They just want to view him as pure evil. Lucas is deep and you people don't want to see it. I also like to add that I hate people like the infamous Red Letter Media, who get famous off of slandering and scrutinizing Lucas' creation. If it wasn't for Lucas that degenerate wouldn't even be known, so as much as he dislikes Lucas, he owes his fame all to him! This guy says \\"Phantom\\" had no main character but that is incorrect. the main character is Qui-Gong, then Anakin! Who the heck do you think is on the screen most of the time!!!! Red Letter Media is despicable.<br /><br />Then there's the Midi-chlorians. I think most of the people that hate this idea feel excluded from the force because they are too fanatical but in actuality the Midi-chlorians are based on the Endosymbiotic theory. Lucas was just using this as a plot device to say \\"Anakin is a very very very strong dude\\" it doesn't mean that the force isn't everywhere or that you are excluded from it. He needed a way to convey to the audience the strength of Anakin and how can you do that through spirituality alone when you have dozens of Jedi moving things around with their minds and such? You need science!<br /><br />Then there's the complaining of the dialogue in \\"Clones,\\" which is a movie I love with all my heart. You people swear the romance between Neo and Trinity, Aragon and Arwen, is so Shakespearean! Also the constant hatred for Hayden's depiction of Anakin is totally misunderstood. Many people claim that he whines too much and that it makes Anakin look like a brat. Let me ask you folks a question: How were you when you were a teenager?! All teenagers are whinny and self-centered! I don't care what you say, that is the truth. Remember the scene when Luke first meets Yoda and he is impatient and whining about \\"we're wasting our time!\\" No one complains about that but that is a straight up parallel to his father Anakin. \\"The boy is impatient\\" Yoda says, yet many \\"fans\\" hate Hayden and not that scene with Luke. Also, Lucas was going for a whole James Dean vibe for Hayden, which i think he nailed impeccably. Go watch \\"Rebel without a Cause.\\" There are alot of resemblances to Hayden's performance yet everyone adores James Dean's performance in that film and no one calls him out for being whinny.<br /><br />I also think people fail to see the importance of Anakin's visions of his mother and wife being killed. This is paralleled in \\"Empire\\" when Luke sees Han and Leia being killed in his visions. Yoda tells him not to go in fear that he will go down the same path as Anakin. This is great story telling and i believe many of you can't see past your hatred because you've lost touch with your inner child and can't stop judging and let your emotional poisons blind you. Somewhere down the line you got the notion in your mind that Star Wars was the next Holy Bible but it was always meant to be fun. All the complaining of dialogue in the prequels is unfair. \\"You scruffy looking nerf herder\\" \\"I Was Going to Toshi Station to Pick Up Some Power Converters ..\\" are lines from the OT that could easily be interpreted as corny dialogue yet no one complains. Face it, many of you have become bitter adults. Put there is always hope.<br /><br />Then there's the complaining about Padme dying of a broken heart. Don't you guys remember that this is the fantasy genre? I thought \\"Revenge of the Sith\\" was just as great as any film from the OT and I can't believe people still find something wrong with it. I loved that film to death.<br /><br />Certain dialogue is really overlookedby many with the \\"western\\" mentality. Lucas derives a lot of themes from eastern philosophy and Joseph Cambell's mythology books. The scene where Anakin tells Padme she's beautiful and she says \\"only because i'm so in love\\" to which he says \\"No, it's because i'm so in love with you\\" is another scene that is torn apart by the degenerate Red Letter Media. What Lucas is trying to say here is that it is the act of loving that brings happiness, not being loved!!!! Which Anakin clearly misunderstands. This went right over your guys' heads. Go read Don Miguel Ruiz' \\"The Mastery of Love\\" or the \\"Tao Te Ching\\" and maybe you will understand.<br /><br />Also a scene in \\"Clones\\" that is hated is the one where Anakin confuses compassion for love, this is something that I found was very touching and i can understand how a jedi, someone sworn to a certain lifestyle like a monk, can misunderstand compassion as \\"encouragement to love.\\" The story is deep and i once again ask you upset viewers to stop being so hateful and open your minds. Stop being judges. That's why so many children love Star Wars because they don't judge! That's why you say Lucas \\"raped\\" your child hood because when you were a child you didn't judge, now that you're an adult, all you do is judge. I think some of you people want Star Wars to be Lord of the Rings. I like LOTR but at times it's too serious. SW is always fun. ALWAYS. That is the difference.<br /><br />And lastly who isn't excited about deleted scenes from the OT?!!! You know you want to see them!<br /><br />I just want to say to people stop being so judgmental and open your mind and heart like you did as a child. i love star wars and i'm not some happy go lucky no brainer. I got problems controlling my anger and Star Wars is one of the few things that makes me happy when i'm down. I can really relate to the story. To anakin's because i want to be wise but i deal with my dark side and also with Luke because i got problems with my father, who is a verycallus man.  In other words: Lighten up and be happy with what you got! I know I am. I'm buying the blu-ray ASAP!
B0059R5Q08|1.0|I pre ordered this and was really looking forward to seeing it but right from the first scenes I was very disappointed. I didn't like that they went on and on with her leaving and trudging around after discovering he was married before they finally got around to getting on with the story. Plus it gave away a latter part of the story. Then for a long time they jumped back and forth in the story. Nothing wrong with the casting. I thought all were good. I would just have preferred that the movie follow the book more closely. I wont look at it again and will resell it at a half price store.
B000WQWPJQ|5.0|Tom hanks is a amazing actor and there aren't to many actor's and actress that could have pulled this part off and as for the how the blue ray looks it's amazing with all the iconic scene's in the movie
B00007K02F|4.0|Considering the fact that I don't even really like William Hurt as an actor as he seems to be too much the same in all roles, I did like him in this. I thought he did a good job and the film followed the book pretty closely. \\"Jane\\" was as plain as she should be with animation bringing beauty to her eyes and face which is as it should be. Of course Joan Plowright \\"is\\" Mrs. Fairfax personified.  Adele is the right size and acts like Adele should. She is charming. LATER: After looking at several movie versions of Jane Eyre I am now more than ever convinced that this is the best one out there. Casting is everything and others that have been much admired by some are simply miscast. I wish it had been longer.
076115728X|5.0|This book is awesome in showing that you can make a mistake, but turn it into something beautiful. What a great way to show how to use your imagination.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I can't say that I'm surprised that Lucas has had his hands on the movies yet again and made more changes; however, I had hoped he'd leave them alone already...guess that was too much to hope for. The audio changes don't even sound right (i.e. Vader's \\"noooo\\" in ROTJ). C'mon George...give us the originals with the cheaper effects that we all grew up with and love. Quit playing around with them just because you can. Han shot first!
0307474712|2.0|I'm not a fan of the book towards the end. I think it started good and I would have rather ended the book when they were in Paris and left the readers to have their own story of what happened next. I was highly disappointed by the tragic ending and subsequent years, it didn't make sense to me. I know that every book doesn't have to be all sweet and lovely, but come on. I'm ending the book in my head when they are in Paris and clearing the other chapters out of my head because it was just awful.
B003EYVXXW|5.0|I showed this movie to a girlfriend who is a devout Catholic. She was fascinated and mortified at the same time. Agora is story of the great Hypatia of Alexandria. Hypatia may have hypothesized elliptical orbits 1400 years before Johannes Kepler.<br /><br />My girlfriend had several nights of questioning her religious conviction. She told me later that she hated me for forcing her to doubt but later appreciated the movie because, it is thought-provoking.<br /><br />Christianity was a religious upstart in the 5th century. Imagine the religious zealots of our day: the end justifies the mean; Machiavelli never said a more crystalline clear phrase. And, so, it is in Agora, the religious zealots are set against reason in the guise of Hypatia. The collapsing world of Rome is divided between true-believers, appeasers and philosophers. Have times really changed that much? Or, is it that the human mind, limited in its capacity, is doomed to repeat mistakes?<br /><br />If this review was helpful, please add your vote.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Easily one of my top 3 books of the year. As I did play video games back in the '80s, I enjoyed the many references to that time. Can't recommend it highly enough, and looking forward to his next book.
B0054N73EY|4.0|Having been a longtime RHCP fan, especially of the John Frusciante era. I was a little bit anxious to hear what the group would sound like with Josh Klinghoffer. The initial single, The Adventures of Rain Dance Maggie, did little to ease my worries but I should have know that with Rick Rubin producing that the Chili Peppers would not disappoint. The new album is certainly not Stadium Arcadium II, but with the basis of Flea, Chad, and Anthony in place it is easy to pick up on the familiar groove that is the RHCP's. Flea's bass playing takes a more prominent role this time around. Some reviews I read mention the lack of guitars, and I was a little scared that there would hardly be any (I was almost expecting it to be like Andy Taylor of Duran Duran, whose guitar playing I love but you hardly ever could hear in Duran Duran). One of the things I liked about SA was that John had just gone all out with his guitars and packed it with lots of layers and solos. Josh doesn't solo much but he creates a lot of great distorted feedback and textures that float around against Flea's bass lines and Anthony's vocals and lyrics continue to improve and define the Chili Peppers sound. It will be interesting to see the subsequent releases from this line-up once they've been together longer.    Anyway, bottom line is... if you liked the Peppers before, have no fear they have not changed that much and I am sure that you will find this album a welcome addition to your RHCP collection so go out and buy it.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|At first I thought this was a dorky show, and it may be to some, but after I started watching it I got hooked. I admit it probably had its dorky moments (like Frak, you'll have to watch to know what I'm saying), but overall this was an awesome series. My wife wound up watching it with me too, so it cannot be that dorky, right, although she is shy to admit it to anyone - again I think because of the name.<br /><br />After each episode I wanted to find out what was going to happen next. There are a lot of twists throughout the seasons.<br /><br />The characters were really what made it for me, I loved some and loved to hate others. It was entertaining and different than the usual that is on TV right now.<br /><br />After you watch this you should start saying \\"Frak\\" and \\"So Say We All\\"
B005D0RDIE|5.0|This show was probably the best concert I have ever attended.  Rush was on the whole night.  From the opening video to the final note of Working Man, the entire audience of over 14000 was on their feet and into it.  I have never seen such an enthusiastic crowd!  Judging from McFadyen and Dunn's other films, this should be a quality DVD!
B004GUSG4M|4.0|I I enjoyed the story. I just didn't feel that the main character was very strong, but how can she be, once her life was sprouted apart. It makes u look       at yourself whether in your Armani or in your target shorts. Your life can change upside down in 2 secs.  Very much enjoyed reading this!  We all can be making a lil money, then taken away, with the economy right now. So enjoy this, the main character found out her real self. I loved reading that. We all find our real selfs, just takes a lot of self recluse, then again, u discover yourself!!!:)
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Good lord Star Wars has had more work done than Joan Rivers and the results are about the same. Lucas is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
B0057A6GA6|5.0|This is one of the Best Games available , Its gets Hard towards the later level but i wanted to keep playing over and over so i guess that is what makes a great game .. I love the Aspect that Some levels Monsters don't just follow the same path but the have different start and end so if you front loaded one section it switches up and your out of luck because they go around it       Just a great game and will suck hours from boredom
B003ZSJ212|1.0|This release of the Star Wars Saga lacks an important part of the series, the original Theatrical release of the original trilogy.<br />George, please stop messing with a masterpiece. The latest additions to the films make a mockery of what was already a great film.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|This app is great for organizing a lot of apps. Enabled me to reduce my homescreens to 3 and now my apps are a lot more accessible. Tons of options and customization. Not one FC yet. Only complaint is that the scrolling is laggy on the folder link Widgets. - Nexus S 4G
B005BQTUVI|5.0|Nothing to add that hadn't been said. One of the best horror movies I've seen. Glad to see it coming out on blu ray. Wish it was in 3d.
B001GCUNYO|5.0|I have seen this movie numerous times and its been out for a few years now and couldnt believe i havent bought it yet.  So i finally bought it and it was well worth it.  This movie should be a must own movie for fans of fighting, action and very intense detective work.  Get it..
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This is one of the worst DVDs I've seen in years, specifically disc 1.  Shame on you AMC, allowing this to be put out. Guess I have to buy the blu ray now.<br />I now have the special edition blu ray. OMG. This looks great in 3D.  I have a convertor and seeing this show in 3d is just amazing.  The artistry of the make up is incredible.  The picture is so clear.  The prefect way to see The Walking Dead is this edition in 3d blu ray. Love it.  Thank God I was able to sell the DVD back through amazon.
B0052YAKS6|2.0|After a really solid outing with his 2009 album, One Love, that thrust him on to the scene, David Guetta is back with Nothing But The Beat. In my opinion, this album was a huge letdown. Instead of great house and dance music, Guetta gave us hip-pop with auto-tuning. I don't know if he is trying to make an inroad with the hip-pop community, but he would have been better served sticking to the music that got him noticed in the first place. The album is a 2 disc edition, with the first disc being songs with artists like Usher, Jennifer Hudson, Snoop Dogg, Nicki Minaj and others. Really, if you're auto-tuning 2 great singers like Usher and Jennifer Hudson, you're doing something wrong. The second cd is made up of instrumentals, 2 of which have other DJs, Lunar feat Afrojack and Sunshine feat Avicii (which is the best track on the album). If you're a fan of Guetta's previous albums, you'll probably be really disappointed with this outing, but if you like commercial hip-pop, then this might be for you. Me? I'm glad I got a free copy as it's coming out of rotation.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Seriously a sad day for Star Wars fans the world over!!!  I always believed in the phrase,\\"don't fix what ain't broken,\\"  and that's what I have always stood by when it came to Star Wars.  Have never been a fan of the newer episodes I-III and now I just don't know what else George can do to ruin this even more so.  Those who are the true Star Wars fans will not even throw a penny at this!!!
B0001IN0DA|5.0|Great 5 star main event and killer undercard too. Highlight is the included documentary of behind the scenes at wm 19. Austins last match, angles broken neck and brock nearly paralyzing himself. Must see.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I love this headset.  I love the volume control, the ability to charge it and then go wireless, the fold down microphone, and the padding for the ears.  The voice modulator and G keys are kind of silly.  The microphone works great (no lag) but I haven't found a real use for the G keys.  Granted, I haven't put a lot of effort in to trying to figure them out either.  The mute button is okay but folding the microphone up is easier.  There is a beep to tell you when the battery is about to go out as well.  The price is a bit much but if you use headsets a lot but don't like to be tied down to one spot (i.e. bathroom breaks or to get a drink) then I highly recommend these.  OH...another plus is the sound is great!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I REFUSE to buy this CRAP!!!!    I will not buy this garbage! Adding Darth Vader screaming in the most pivotal scene of the entire franchise is the straw that broke the camels back!!!!    This is ridiculous, and the only way George will fix this is IF WE DON'T BUY IT!!!!!     I am as big a Star Wars fan as you will ever meet (I PROMISE YOU). THIS IS GARBAGE!!!!!!!

1416594787|5.0|\\"The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution\\", Richard Dawkins, Free Press, New York, 2009. ISBN 978-1-4165-9478-9, HC 439/470  Notes 5 pgs., Bibliog. 6 pgs.,  Index 129 pgs.,  9 1/2\\"  x 6 1/4\\". Inveigelments:  32 pages of full color photographs & illustrations plus generous scattering of B/W graphs and sketches.<br /><br />A full-length book by a renowned author of nine full-length published studies on evolution, a retired Professor of Science from Oxford University, and recipient of numerous awards, honors and prizes for his writings.<br /><br />Richard Dawkins covers, in 13 chapters, the A to Z exposition of Evolution as espoused by Charles Darwin, forcefully and persuasively, garnering evidences, both large and small, to clarify and help prove the wording of his subtitle: The Evidence for Evolution.  Dawkin's aim, clearly, is to rid scientific thinking of evolution as a mere theory to one expounding evolution as an established fact.  He dives head on into what was once a peculiarly American phenomenon wherein schools were supplied with state-approved textbooks that had the word `evolution' systematically expunged, but that's something now Britain and Europe faces because of their growing Islamic presence; but now done in the guise of 'multiculturalism' and shielding officials who could otherwise be thought racist.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I foresee a high probability that future Darwinian evolution discourse will become another taboo subject, akin to discussions of IQ, racial origins, etc. and this book will be unable to live up to its title \\"The Greatest Show on Earth\\".  I heartily recommend this book.  If you've never read \\"On the Origin of Species\\", buy that book and read it also.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|An excellent early Disney movie. The dogs are awesome, and kids and adults will both love it. It's sad Disney doesn't make thes hand-drawn animated flims anymore. We love the CGI ones, but they miss the charm of these earlier efforts.
0553801473|2.0|I'm so disappointed. I love great fantasy and GRRM is one of my favorite writers, but this is more like reading a text book with nothing but facts.<br /><br />A Dance with Dragons is just not up to Martin's ability.
0786955570|5.0|(I bought this one for my 11 year old nephew, who loves it.  I already have it)    I grew up playing D&D in the 70's.  I have a lot of fond memories of it. I don't have the time to learn the new rules and get together with a lot of people to play it like I used to.  I had heard about this from a friend and immediately got it.  It's not a full-blown D&D adventure but a very good 1-2 hour game that you can play by yourself or with friends.   My friend plays D&D and he liked this game.  It's quick and if you have a good group there are many strategy decisions to be made.  the game is varied enough for replay value plus they have a couple other similar games (Wrath of Ashardalon, Legend of Drizzt) that can be combined.   Also, they have some extra scenarios on their website.  If you get this game, you MUST go to the BoardGameGeek website as that community has created a lot of extras (rules, scenarios, cards) that can be used with this game which really enhance the product and make a great game even better.     If you have family or friends that are turned off by the words Dungeons and Dragons or are not into fantasy type games, don't worry.  I think the game is fun enough that they will enjoy it.  My wife could care less about D&D but really enjoyed playing this on multiple occasions.  There is some fun decision making and she also enjoyed killing off the monsters 8-)      The people that complain about it not being a full blown D&D game (with Dungeon Master, multiple leveling up, etc..) did not do their due diligence in researching this game.     All in all, a fun game that was recently voted as Origins Game of the Year for 2010.
B004T5K3OK|5.0|I used the free version for several months before finding the pro key on sale at Amazon. Simply the best two dollars I have spent on a App. Load the newer Market version first and then come back to Amazon and buy the key. Now you have the newest version at a great price. A++++

0061784788|3.0|James Rollins is one of my favorite authors and someone whose books I always eagerly anticipate.  The Devil Colony was not horrible and had it's moments, but was overly long and completely ridiculously unbelievable in parts.<br /><br />Rollins has made a niche with his Sigma Force novels which is a group of special forces operatives that are a shadowy government organization called on to investigate unusual happenings and circumstances.  The same characters, who have never been particularly interesting or well drawn out despite the length of his novels-populate each one with a villain that is also somehow an ally.  Devil Colony starts out strong with thoughts that the founding of our country was based upon something completely different than we have been taught along with a catastrophic occurrence that could bring down the world.  The strength of this book is similar to a book like da Vinci code where he is teaching us things about history such as the Meriwether Lewis was shot to death and it was ruled a suicide when in fact many think it was a murder.  The inter-weavings of past founding history and facts that are little known but true is absolutely fascinating.  Where this book loses itself is during the action scenes that are canned, ludicrus and corny.  Did someone get rescued by a Killer Whale?  Yes.  Did someone break in to Fort Knox?  Yes.  My gripe is just that I felt like the silliness bogged down what could have been an excellent and interesting work mixing action and historical fiction such as many of Rollins previous novels.  This book was 100 pages too long.<br /><br />If you have already read Rollins and you love him, I would recommend this book-but if you have not read Rollins before-start with one of his paperbacks such as Altar of Eden, The Last Oracle or Black Order.  Those are all much, much better books in my opinion.  I love James Rollins, but this one was just too long and corny and I expect a lot from this excellent author.
B005COO1X6|5.0|Stephen King's story, MILE 81, is a delight for any of his readers with memories of the classic stuff - CHRISTINE and PET SEMETARY and CUJO and great stories like \\"The Mist\\" and \\"The Body.\\"  This is King at his best, with characters so real they remind you of people you've known for years.  I've always felt King did his best work with his shorter fiction - here his prose is tight and perfect, giving the story itself a chance to both terrify and delight the reader.<br /><br />MILE 81 is about a long-abandoned rest stop on Rt. 95 in Maine.  Ten-year-old Pete Simmons, who has been left behind when his older brother runs off to play daredevil bike stunts, decides to explore the old rest stop to see if he can scare up an adventure of his own.  What happens is something he never could have imagined.  A succession of other travelers also pull into the rest stop, each investigating a strangely muddied station wagon inexplicably parked there.  King's story is divided into sections, each one giving us a brief glimpse into the lives of these varied characters before they are sucked into the horror of what awaits at the Mile 81 rest stop.<br /><br />The story is both colloquially fresh and intensely exciting.  I liked Pete, and I understood him completely.  I liked the others, too - insurance salesman Doug, horsewoman Julie, the Lussier family, and Jimmy the cop.  These are real people who find themselves in Stephen King's \\"Twilight Zone\\" world on a perfectly ordinary afternoon.  And you know it's true - horror seems more horrible when it happens in broad daylight, with the traffic whizzing by and the sun shining.<br /><br />Great story - classic King.  Highly recommended.
0451232577|4.0|I had very high expectations for Follett's latest, especially after reading Pillars of the Earth and World Without End. It isn't bad, far from it- the book has enough character development and plot sustain a reader's interest to the end.   BUT, be prepared for a very large dose of politics. Normally, Follett has the ability to blend history with an interesting plot. This one wasn't a completely successful union of literary elements. I think Follett wanted to convey his knowledge of WWI but fell short of expressing it in an interesting manner. I found myself skimming pages at a time waiting to get back to the story.
B0058A119G|2.0|All right, I tried, I really tried to listen to this with an objective ear and optimistic heart.  By the time I finished listening to the CD I had totally forgotten what songs I had just listened to.  First, why only 10 songs?  For a project that is supposed to be a labor of love why was it born with only 10 tracks?  Yes, there are supposedly two others floating out there but that is still only twelve songs.  Sorry, but for a woman with tons of free time, I would think she could crank out God forbid a two-CD set.  Second, every bloody arrangement sounds the same, even with the presence of Chris Botti to add some heat to a few tracks.  The first three tracks are not bad in terms of lyrics, vocals, and arrangements; but then things get shaky with tepid arrangements, bland lyrics, and yes boring vocals.  She tries hard with \\"The Promise\\" but you can feel her straining to hit those notes but again dammit the arrangement sound like it was done by an intern with no sense of color and dramatic tension.  Barbra Streisand has created her own world literally and it is about time for someone in her camp to have the guts to tell her that her \\"visions\\" and integrity suck.  No, she should not do a duets album with Lady Gaga and Lea Michele but she has to get in shape vocally before stepping into the studio and to hire arrangers who know what they are doing and who make her work vocally.  Ah, well. . . art isn't easy.
0307454541|2.0|I am actually glad to see the negative reviews here. I picked up this book because of all the good things I'd heard about it but I just can't get into it at all. I kept thinking it is going to get better - after all on the back cover one of the reviews says \\"the ultimate page turner\\" - but it hasn't been a page turner at all and I just don't think I am going to read any more of it. It just isn't any fun to do so.
B003SWNRU2|5.0|While I had heard Accept's more popular songs, most notably \\"Ball to the Wall\\" back in the day I was never a big Accept fan...    That has all changed.     I saw them live here in San Antonio, TX a few months ago and was very impressed!  I was thinking \\"This new guy can sing!\\"    This \\"new guy\\" is Mark Tornillo and man can he ever sing.      Listen do yourself a favor and BUY THIS ALBUM!  Every song on Blood of the Nations is good/great.  My favorite is track 3 \\"The Abyss\\"      Check them out of YouTube then do the right thing and support the band by PURCHASING a authorized CD, so they can tour, so I can see them live again! :)

0812979656|1.0|Slow and depressing, I kept turning the pages expecting more.  And it kept being slow and depressing.  And then disturbing.  Such a highly reviewed book, I have to say is on my top 10 of books I hate and will never reccommend.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|You might think the title makes this game sound horrible but quite frankly this is the best game I have played on Android. Yes, Angry Birds is up there but quite different.

030788743X|5.0|This book combines The Amazing Race, the golden ticket in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory and the virtual world found in the book Snowcrash by Neal Stephenson. Definitely one of the best books I read in 2011!<br /><br />It's 2044 and the world has become a dark and destitute place. The people are saved from having to slog through their dismal reality by the invention of a virtual world called OASIS. Jacking into OASIS allows you to become a part of a digital universe with limitless possibilities. However, the amount of access you have depends on the money you're able to spend for gear and the quality of your connection.<br /><br />Virtual worlds are only as utopic as the people within them, and humans have a tendency towards power plays. In this setting, the power is through the internet connections and ability to manipulate OASIS once there. There is one company, in particular, who is close to monopolizing all the connections, and would like nothing better than to own OASIS for themselves.<br /><br />However, James Halliday, the founder of OASIS, wanted his world to be accessible to everybody. As he lays dying, he sees the imminent power struggle on the horizon and knows he will not be around to stop it. So, he comes up with a plan. He will make the world's largest scavenger hunt and set up clues and puzzles throughout OASIS.<br /><br />The person who solves them first will be the new and invincible leader of OASIS. They will be the keeper of the key, to be used positively or negatively. Wade, our protaganist, is a poor kid with a long shot. His imagination is sparked by the possibility that anybody could win this race and he sets off to do the impossible, be the first to solve the scavenger hunt.<br /><br />Even as the years pass, and the rest of the world's interest wanes, Wade carries on with his research, until one day he comes across the solution to the first puzzle and re-ignites the fervor once again. So sets up the race between good and evil. A struggle to be the first person to find the prize that will unlock unlimited power, in both real and virtual worlds.<br /><br />Anybody who grew up in the 80s and remembers the music, movies, tv shows and old video games fondly will enjoy this book. It brought back nostalgia of playing Space Invaders on the Atari and the excitement I felt the morning I received my first Nintendo.<br /><br />Despite the 80s trivia, there are a lot of themes in the book that relate to concepts our society is grappling with now. Most notably, it addressed issues in regards to net neutrality and open source coding, the ability to control the flow of information and education, how we interact with each other virtually and in reality, and what constitutes a relationship and friendship.<br /><br />It also acknowledged the complications in how we define ourselves and the concept of self-identity in a real and virtual world. How, sometimes, it's easier to relate to our handle and online persona than to our actual self.<br /><br />If you are familiar with online games such as Everquest and World of Warcraft or if you've ever kept a blog or interacted with Facebook and social media, you will recognize the world of OASIS. Don't get me wrong, OASIS was not a regurgitation of those worlds. Rather it was the next horizon of what will become possible.<br /><br />It was especially refreshing how OASIS was integrated into more productive aspects of everyday life, particularly when it came to education and public learning. I loved the ideas introduced with online classroom learning and being able to fully engage students into a subject. Could we be looking at a solution to our underfunded public schools and a new frontier for educating our society?<br /><br />Evidence suggests that this would be the case. I recently came across an article that talks about the new role of technology in our classroom and how it's being used to connect and inspire students to their lesson material. Months after reading this book, I'm still left thinking about these ideas.<br /><br />That, alone, should convince you read this book!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|It now seems that even MORE changes have been added...    I could sort of take it before, but after seeing a preview, I just had to cancel  my pre-order, such a shame, I'll be sticking with my DVD copies, and ignoring this release until  either the original versions are released, or even the 1997 or 2004 editions (not likely).
140053271X|5.0|Before you read my review I want to clarify something. I'm a vanity person and I couldn't care less about how well a product works as long as it's pretty. As long as it works, it's fine. Also I'm a very simple minded person so I only use it for reading. And those 2 things are what I'm reviewing. I fell in love with this ereader the moment I laid eyes on it. It was like they finally made one for me. I do not buy anything that is not fully touch screen if it can be. I would feel old and degraded. So the fact that they finally came up with this is like magical. No glare, but touch screen is exactly what I wanted from an ebook reader. It works perfect and it's so cute and pretty. It does exactly what it's for. Displays books for you to read. Plus even if it only works ok, it's so cute it will make up for all the problems.
142212312X|5.0|This is a very short read, but packed with valuable insights.  Drucker has a way of directly, clearly and concisely communicating important and helpful advice and business wisdom.  Probably duplicative of other works of his, but nice to have such a focused piece.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|The Gruffalo has seen a lot of use in our house. A cute and clever kid's book. This movie competently captures the mood of the book. The animation matches the original art very closely, and it's got the lines from the original book (plus a few more).    This is not a long feature at all, but it really shouldn't be (don't get me started on Where The Wild Things Are movie).
B000KC5350|4.0|Looks like OEM Nuvi product. Didn't want to gamble with generics, which work for some Nuvi models and not others.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|These are not the original versions, not even the 1997 or 2004 editions, it seems Lucas  has once again changed his mind, and made more alterations, this time too much to ignore.    My pre-order is canceled, and for such an avid Blu Ray collector, it's a bit gutting, but it is  the right thing to do.    I shall stick to my DVD copies.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|You've gone too far this time Lucas... Too far. I will not buy these films ever again in this state. STOP THE REVISIONISM.    NEVER AGAIN UNTIL THIS \\"NOOOOOOOOO\\" NONSENSE IS CORRECTED.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|This is by far one of my favorite shows on TV right now. It's funny, clever, and has some really great spoofs of modern pop culture. I would recommend it to anyone who likes comedy.

B0028YPDVW|5.0|This is a female wolf, I do wish they would have specified that, but I wanted a female wolf figure, so I was happy. I was hoping this was female, I would have been severely disappointed if it were male. The coloring of the coat is wonderful, very detailed. The pose is lovely and the detail onthe paws is excellent, the pads of its feet are individually sculpted, so very realistic. My only real complaint is the eyes: the people at schleich hit it out of the park everywhere but the eyes. The pupils aren't going in the same direction, making the wolf look wall-eyed, which is really weird and detracts from the whole effect. Overall, it's a good wolf, seems pretty durable so long as you don't yank on the legs or tail too hard, they have a little flex to them, but I wouldn't recommend pushing it. It's not as big as the safari wolf I bought, but since it's part of a pack, not all wolves are the same size in real life, so for children, this is a very good toy and they probably won't notice or care about the size difference.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Well, thanks for ruining the ending of Return of the Jedi.  I know now not to buy this set.  I guess I need to invest in a laserdisc player.
B004097IKW|5.0|I don't understand a damn why people would give this a 'one star' review for the SOLE reason of stage lighting.<br />Instead of bemoaning such, why not concentrate on the music?<br />We have three solidly outstanding leads in this opera: Florez, D'Arcangelo and Machaidze.<br />Let's begin with Nino Machaidze.<br />I don't think she is a natural coloratura. However, she has GOOD coloratura technique.  Comparing her with Anna Netrebko in the same role, surprisingly Machaidze is much MORE convincing both vocally and visually!<br />Machaidze's voice has not yet gained that requisite freedom of negotiation in passage work; that said, she sings accurately, cleaning, musically and FAITHFULLY.<br />Not the same can be said of Anna Netrebko in her MET I Puritani DVD, alas.  Netrebko's passagios are muddled; her characterisation superficial.  Nino Machaidze is at least much more conscious of the role's mood changes and musical demands, and it shows in her performance.  As a very young soprano, she is one to watch.<br />Needless to say, Juan Diego Florez is the major attraction for this release.  While not necessarily the best in Bellini (as compared to his Rossini), his is a sterling performance, and he looks every inch the part.  He also has a wonderful chemistry with Machaidze that Eric Cutler so sadly lacked with Netrebko in the MET version.<br />D'Arcangelo is of course one of the major reasons why this performance is superior to the other MET one.<br />All the three leads pour in committed and superb performances that makes this Bologna production worthy.<br />The stage setting and direction are not comparable to the MET's, but the performance is far better both musically and dramatically.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Inside Job combines thorough research with thoughtful critical commentary. Without getting lost in detail, it provides perspective on a crisis that could have been prevented.

B0042U94UQ|4.0|Def. glad i bought this movie, i loe to watch it and I enjoy it, but I was sad to see it came in one of those really thin dvd cases that are cheaper. So -1 star, but the dvd is still good!
B004T5R2HQ|1.0|Just like the other G2 users on here, I get squiggly colorful lines when I try to scan something. Looks promising, but broken for G2 right now.
B0057A6GA6|5.0|This game has lots of levels and very good replay value.  Also has great graphics for a phone game.  One of the best defense games out there.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Too bad George Lucas can't leave well enough alone. I was very excited for this Blu Ray set, but I have been forced to cancel my pre-order (which I placed on the day that the set was announced) because of the proposed changes that Lucas is making to the films. As the reviews are showing, I am not the only person disappointed with Lucas/Lucasfilms' decision to alter the films for the Blu Ray release. Let Lucasfilm take note. However, it will be too little too late. I won't be buying any future Star Wars box sets or special releases or whatever.
1451629184|5.0|This memoir is unbelievable.  I read it in 2 days.  Jaycee is an incredible woman and survived the unthinkable.  A must read!!
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Think about it, a couple of weeks ago only a fringe group of Star Wars fans wanted the original unaltered trilogy on Blu-ray, now every original Star Wars fan is jumping up and down demanding it. If he announced that he was going to release the original unaltered trilogy on Blu-ray after releasing these versions, he would be laughing all the way to the bank. Or maybe he's just a crazy stubborn old fart who has lost touch with reality.
B0054TKBBA|4.0|Thought this was going to be another silly show but I am surprised at how much fun it is.  Worth the watch indeed.
B00008PX8P|5.0|There were not much Video footage of this band, but here, they have restore many rare archives footage, and the result is amazing. The sound in DTS is very good. I have never seen the Royal Albert Hall show from 1970,and i was surprised to see that footage here, that i didn't know existed. Just for that, the DVD is worth buying, but there is a lot more to enjoy!
0634060384|3.0|If you can, be sure to check out the table of contents. If you're looking to replace your 1978 edition you may be disappointed.  A lot of tunes are gone and not just obscure Steve Swallow and Mike Gibbs ones either. No Pork Pie Hat, for example, as well as some of those old unrecorded Metheny charts. Other tunes are now spread across multiple volumes.     Some of the harmony clean-up is substantial, the bridge of 'Round Midnight, for example. A lot of charts still sound iffy, to me at least. I hope that's a sign my ear has developed somewhat since those days.    What I miss the most are the references at the bottom to various recordings; they often held clues to what the transcriber was really after.    Personally I've come to rely more on Frank Mantooth's and Dick Hyman's books of charts but my '78 Real Book has followed me through musical life and is still the best $15 I ever spent.
B002ZG980U|5.0|I had heard that this movie was good, but I had to see for myself, so I purchased it on a whim. I mean, my husband read reviews that said \\"Battle of Los Angeles\\" was good, so he bought that one and it was terrible. Inception was so good, it's one of those movies you will want to keep in your collection so you can watch it again. You will totally enjoy the special effects. This movie does not disappoint! I hate when reviews give the movie away, but this one actually has a story line to it and really stunning special effects, unlike the previous mentioned movie. If you enjoyed the Matrix movies, you will enjoy this one for the similar complexity of it. I hope that makes sense!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I was going to wait and buy this set on special for 50% off or more. Now I wouldn't even take a free copy.    George you can't have my money, until you release the original unaltered trilogy on Blu-ray.
1891252089|4.0|This is a great book for at home practice. Its extensive and gives great demo...also has easy cheat sheets at the end if you forget a pose. Note:its far too bulky to bring on the road.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|You have finally made me turn my back on Star Wars. Making Vader shout 'Nnnoooooo' as he throws the Emperor to his death, what were you thinking. Stop surrounding yourself with Yes men, like your little lap dog Rick McCallum and listen to what the fans, the people who have given you their money for years, want.    I could put up with Greedo shooting first, barely, that scene alone destroyed the character of Han Solo. I can understand a CGI Yoda for TPM, that makes sense, but having Vader shout 'Nnooo',come on. We can see what Vader is going through without you having to add some real crappy dialouge. You have destroyed a pivotol piece of cinema and put the the final nail in the coffin of destroying what was once a great trilogy.    I have cancelled my order and will not bother with this piece of crap until you come to your senses and release the original untouched trilogy in HD.    See ya George.
B00009P1O0|5.0|This album is part two (technically three...) of his most artful, legendary trilogy.  (Time Fades Away and Tonight's the Night were the other two for those of you unfamiliar with the background on his discography).  They were all recorded during a time when his friends were dying/dead from heroin.  This trilogy represents Neil's resentments: against people, against drugs, against fame, against rock 'n' roll, against the world.  Like \\"A Day in the Life\\" sums up one of the most important eras in rock, \\"Ambulance Blues\\" sums up an indescribable emotion that feels very unsettling.  I wasn't alive when this album came out, but you bet it is probably one of the least quotes and most important \\"rock\\" albums of modern music.

1439153663|5.0|I just finished reading this book. I was so happy that I could find it on Amazon.com. It was not available in stores or at the library. Buyiing it on Amazon was so easy. It is so inexpesive to get a used book that I can keep and lend.
B00004STPT|5.0|Other than the Unparalleled work of Jon Barry's Dances with Wolves, Hans Zimmer has created Another Masterpiece of soundtracks for Gladiator.  Had the soundtracks for either of these movies been different and less appealing, so would have the movies.  The soundtrack in a movie is such an integral part of bringing the viewer's emotions to heightened peaks that bring them into the actual experience as if they were there, which is the True key to any producers/directors deepest hopes in finding an audience.    There are Many others worth mentioning that perform the same tasks, but Nowhere Near to the Extent that this one and DWWolves does, as well as The Last Samurai(yet another of Hans Zimmer's masterpieces).  All three of these movies have been made infinitely more enjoyable due to the Immense passion that is inspired by their soundtracks, and Gladiator is the 2nd(chronologically) of the \\"Big Three\\" to have that impact..  The intensity in the fight scenes is magnified immeasurably by the quality and composition of the audio themes that accompany them, along with every other scene that generates the same emotions...    You need need not be an audiophile to truly enjoy listening to them at any time...  You just need to have loved the movies that they accompanied....
B004EC5IUW|5.0|When I first heard they were remaking the Evangelion series I thought, \\"Why? So you can put it on blue ray and get more money out of me?\\" Then a friend showed it to me and I was blown away. This remake is like watching a completely new show. Same characters and basic plot--but they've changed the storyline a lot! And you know what? So far I like this version better than the original. It's not as depressing, and it's a lot more exciting. Shinji has really manned-up. Rei has other emotions besides \\"robot.\\" Gendo isn't a complete sociopath. I feel I can actually follow the storyline. I just love this remake! I like the changes to the story. I like the characters better. And honestly, I like the animation better--the angles are just awesome. I can't wait for the next installment.
B004SHED22|4.0|This book has some great adventures and definetly pulls on the heart. You can almost feel her hope and then feel her agony. Definetly a different take on a war-time account. I have read many books in this area and some always seem to tie back to the same basic grounds but not this one.
B003UESJEM|5.0|This movie is a well written, terrifically acted sign of the times.  The story it tells, of vital, talented people losing their jobs and finding themselves in a bleak, often brutal job market is one of the more realistic depictions of our current economy available.  Ben Affleck seems to really be coming into his own now, after a few years of floundering.  In this film, he portrays his character with a warmth and understanding rare in a Hollywood film.  The rest of the cast is equally excellent.  Don't expect a fast paced film - this one takes its time to paint its portrait and its well worth your patience.  Highly recommended!
B002C6A6FY|5.0|This movie is a must-see for folks of all ages!  I can't believe I had never seen it before.  Wonderful love story.
159448385X|5.0|Sadly I watched the Kite Runner and now regret watching it even though it wasn't a bad movie. When I read this book I was completely taken in by the characters. The Author does a wonderful job of taking descriptions of Afghanistan and bringing to life in such a poetic way. I felt apart of the characters lives and was drenched in the sorrow and love that was felt by the main characters. This was the first book that ever made me truly cry. What a wonderful writer I hope does something else I look forward to it.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|All I can say is \\"no.\\" Lucasfilm should never have added Christensen to the 2004 DVD release of Jedi, but it looks like the changes to this Blu-Ray set will be far worse than that. Please don't buy this.
1594744769|4.0|This book is definately outside the normal. This is a great author/writer. I think he has touched ground that has not been touched before. I have not read many book that would fall into the same category as this, but I do have to say this book is a good one, even if you do not normally read book like this. There is a hell of a twist about 3/4 of the way through that was never expected! Enjoy it!
B0059R5Q08|5.0|This is oddly my favorite film of the novel. Oddly, meaning, only because it leaves out important scenes of the story. Everything else, the acting, the costumes, even the parts where script was rearranged (which were done quite well, actually). I just wish that a few scenes were left in. A bit more of Jane's school life, and a few key scenes that tell more of how Jane and Rochester start to fall for each other. Books into movies, no one should dare expect the entirety of said book to be put into script. However, some important parts, again, should have been left in.    But the actors, the setting, the clothing even, and of course the music, capture the essence of the story to a T. Remarkable. Wasikowska couldn't have been a better pick for the role of Jane, she plays her exactly as I ever imagined. Not to mention, she looks the part entirely. No other adaptation had a young enough looking actress, nor one done so damn well. Fassbender, oh my, the best Rochester yet. He fits the description that \\"Jane\\" portrays to her readers perfectly. Athletic build, the high forehead, etc, not exactly the type for \\"handsome\\" in those days. (A bit opposite, in this day and age, hah.) He plays the role of stern, ill tempered, a bit pompous, yet somehow charming and enjoyable all the same time, beautifully. Dench as Mrs. Fairfax? I shouldn't even need to explain why she was perfect for the role. So I will not. Clarkson as the young Jane, what an amazing young actress. I hope to see her in more films, for such a young age, well, regardless of that even, she is better than most adult actresses I have seen.    The modern approach on the telling of the story, starting with the end and working some flashback action in, I actually found a bit refreshing. An excellent way to tell the story, honestly. Every other version has done a cover-to-cover style, which is also good and all, but it was a nice change.    The entire cast is just perfect, their emotions are played out perfectly. No overdone dramatic scenes, no over the top love scenes either. The subtlety that I got from the book between Jane and Rochester are done beautifully. I really do wish, again, though, that a handful of important scenes were kept from the novel. Regardless, I can't seem to not want to watch this version. And read the book, again, compare, etc. Sorry if I rambled a bit, cats!
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|I already have this film on the DVD but very glad that spend money for the Blu-ray version too.<br />Video improvement, picture quality is amazing now, colors saturated, every tiny details is distinguishable.<br />Audio is impressive too, somebody can say \\"perfect\\" and I'll agree.<br />Disk worth every dollar, must-be in every Blu-ray home collection.
0891419063|5.0|A remarkable book; the author's first-hand account of the battles of Peleiu and Okinawa. You are right beside him throughout, feeling his fear, his anger, and his sense of revenge. Oh, and he awakens in the reader an understanding of the utter senselessness of war.  Probably the best of the books on the war in the Pacific Theatre
B003ZSJ212|1.0|More ridiculous changes from George Lucas? Par for the course. I've never been outraged by them until now, though. George has all the resources in the world to give the fans what they want (and include his ever-changing vision of these films, as well), but instead he gives us only the latter. And now the original films contain spare parts from FIVE DECADES. Is this out of arrogance? Out of spite? Senility? Perhaps we'll never know.    Like most fans, I was looking forward to watching these films in Hi-Def, Special Editions or not, but these films continue to sink to new lows. Don't reward anyone for it. These have ceased being films and are now amalgams of classic movie moments, bad (modern) special effects, and even worse story revisions. Stop it, George. Now.
0743289692|5.0|I picked up this book and I couldn't put it down.It's a story of courage and drive and how much pain a human can handle.. Infidel is well written you will be moved by the pure honesty and raw gripping hardship that she went through.
B00000G3AZ|2.0|I happened to get to see this one on TV before I could buy it and I must say...its one version I'd rather not own. While the cast is surprisingly familiar from the casts of many other lower-key films I enjoy (and extras from more popular ones) the acting is unusual and disjointed. Personalities from the novel are over-exaggerated or not present at all. My largest dissapointment was with not deemming it worth owning, since it has been my goal to own every TV/theatrical version of all of my favorite Jane Austin-era novels, but this one I don't want, unless its for \\"bad movie night\\".<br /><br />I do commend Gweneth Paltrow's efforts at playing a role for a story she's probably never heard of and an era never she's bothered to act for. I appreciate her efforts, but the older versions have outdone them.<br /><br />**I know I did not comment on the story line, but I'm certain another reviewer has written enough on the matter...along with Jane Austin.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I can't believe that George Lucas added the NOOOO scream at the end of Jedi.  Blinking Ewok's can be forgiven.  Emo Vador? Not at all.
B000PKG7I4|4.0|Of course,i like it.i would not have ordered it if i didn't  And I can't imagine why you ask for these on new items
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I'd appreciate simply taking the original movie, cleaning them up visually to HD crispness, AND THAT'S IT! This time they've added to the CG adulteration and the addition of Vader yelping \\"nooooo\\" as he tosses the Emperor. All this does, other than to turn classic into corny, is to remind us that whatever Lucas was in the 70s and 80s, some kind of mental degeneration has turned him into something else entirely. With every corny, cheap, unimaginative, and tasteless project he's taken up since that original trilogy, he's only worked to sour the legacy of those amazing 3 movies. And now this Blu Ray serves to inflict that onto those movies themselves.

B003Y5H556|2.0|There's no good reason for watching this movie after terrible reviews when it was originally released.  Still, Amanda Seyfried is always easy on the eyes.  Then there's Gary Oldman, Virginia Madsen and Julie Christie.  Can it really be that bad?  Well, yes it can.  For every actor in the caliber of those mentioned above there's Max Irons and Shiloh Fernandez as emotionless and stone faced potential suitors for Valerie (Seyfried).  Hell, they make Edward from \\"Twilight\\" seem exciting.  Speaking of \\"Twilight\\", director Catherine Hardwicke from this film also directed the first and perhaps only watchable \\"Twilight\\".  I guess she was trying to capture some of the \\"magic\\" in this clunker.  The sets are crummy, the script is painful, the fairy tale clich&eacute;s are horrible, the acting is bad, the special effects aren't special, and the sex is non-existent.  I mean, what's the point?

B003ZSJ212|1.0|\\"My name is George Lucas. I am a writer, director, and producer of motion pictures and Chairman of the Board of Lucasfilm Ltd., a multi-faceted entertainment corporation.    I am not here today as a writer-director, or as a producer, or as the chairman of a corporation. I've come as a citizen of what I believe to be a great society that is in need of a moral anchor to help define and protect its intellectual and cultural heritage. It is not being protected.    The destruction of our film heritage, which is the focus of concern today, is only the tip of the iceberg. American law does not protect our painters, sculptors, recording artists, authors, or filmmakers from having their lifework distorted, and their reputation ruined. If something is not done now to clearly state the moral rights of artists, current and future technologies will alter, mutilate, and destroy for future generations the subtle human truths and highest human feeling that talented individuals within our society have created.    A copyright is held in trust by its owner until it ultimately reverts to public domain. American works of art belong to the American public; they are part of our cultural history.    People who alter or destroy works of art and our cultural heritage for profit or as an exercise of power are barbarians, and if the laws of the United States continue to condone this behavior, history will surely classify us as a barbaric society. The preservation of our cultural heritage may not seem to be as politically sensitive an issue as \\"when life begins\\" or \\"when it should be appropriately terminated,\\" but it is important because it goes to the heart of what sets mankind apart. Creative expression is at the core of our humanness. Art is a distinctly human endeavor. We must have respect for it if we are to have any respect for the human race.    These current defacements are just the beginning. Today, engineers with their computers can add color to black-and-white movies, change the soundtrack, speed up the pace, and add or subtract material to the philosophical tastes of the copyright holder. Tomorrow, more advanced technology will be able to replace actors with \\"fresher faces,\\" or alter dialogue and change the movement of the actor's lips to match. It will soon be possible to create a new \\"original\\" negative with whatever changes or alterations the copyright holder of the moment desires. The copyright holders, so far, have not been completely diligent in preserving the original negatives of films they control. In order to reconstruct old negatives, many archivists have had to go to Eastern bloc countries where American films have been better preserved.    In the future it will become even easier for old negatives to become lost and be \\"replaced\\" by new altered negatives. This would be a great loss to our society. Our cultural history must not be allowed to be rewritten.    There is nothing to stop American films, records, books, and paintings from being sold to a foreign entity or egotistical gangsters and having them change our cultural heritage to suit their personal taste.    I accuse the companies and groups, who say that American law is sufficient, of misleading the Congress and the People for their own economic self-interest.    I accuse the corporations, who oppose the moral rights of the artist, of being dishonest and insensitive to American cultural heritage and of being interested only in their quarterly bottom line, and not in the long-term interest of the Nation.    The public's interest is ultimately dominant over all other interests. And the proof of that is that even a copyright law only permits the creators and their estate a limited amount of time to enjoy the economic fruits of that work.    There are those who say American law is sufficient. That's an outrage! It's not sufficient! If it were sufficient, why would I be here? Why would John Houston have been so studiously ignored when he protested the colorization of \\"The MalteseFalcon?\\" Why are films cut up and butchered?    Attention should be paid to this question of our soul, and not simply to accounting procedures. Attention should be paid to the interest of those who are yet unborn, who should be able to see this generation as it saw itself, and the past generation as it saw itself.    I hope you have the courage to lead America in acknowledging the importance of American art to the human race, and accord the proper protection for the creators of that art--as it is accorded them in much of the rest of the world communities.\\"
0061801313|5.0|So I saw my friend reading this book in class, looked at the title, and promptly forgot about it.<br /><br />When I forget things like this, the memory comes back when I see something familiar to it.<br /><br />So I was at Barnes & Noble because my mom wanted me to keep reading over the summer. So I picked up my summer reading books and this box set caught my eye. and as you can guess the memory came back! My mom told me to pick out a few books so she bought this for me. As soon as we got in the car I opened the package and began reading book 1.<br /><br />Much to my family's annoyance, I would read these books for hours on end, reading through lunch or late through the night because they are just so GOOD!<br /><br />After i finished 1-4 i had to find out what happened next so I went straight back to Barnes & Noble and bought 5-9 (seperate from each other) and finished the whole series in a month! I like reading when the book is good, and i LOVED reading this series. For late middle schoolers and all high schoolers. No one under 12 should read this due to the series's content. Intriging mystery. The best book is book 8.<br /><br />Important characters:<br />Aria: unknowingly hooks up with her English teacher. Her father cheated on her mother with his student, Meredith.

A teases Spencer about always being second best in her parents eyes.<br />Emily: isn't sure about her feelings. When Maya St. Germain becomes her girlfriend, A taunts her she will reveal her relationship with everyone if Emily doesn't do as A says.<br />Hanna: had trouble feeling comfortable in her own skin...until she went on a \\"burge and purge\\" diet; eating tons of food and throwing it all up. She became popular with her new best friend of Mona Vanderwaal. A controls her with the diet problem as power<br /><br />The biggest character:<br /><br />A. 'A' is an anonymous figure sending threatening texts to all four girls as they try to solve Ali's murder.<br />If Aria, Spencer, Emily or Hanna make one wrong move, they'll be gone...for good.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|In 1989, the U.S. National Film Registry of the Library of Congress selected the film as a \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically important\\" film. If this is true, then why can George Lucas keep changing this film and the trilogy it comprises? In 1977 Star Wars was released. In 1997 it was rereleased with added footage and various edits small and large that in my opinion altered the movie for the worse - Han Solo no longer shot first in the cantina meaning the plot contorted itself to allow his opponent to shoot first but miss from a table away, the space battles now included a mixture of the original model work and sporadically inserted computer graphics in a jarring way, Return of the Jedi now had different closing scenes song and different performance in another part, while matte paintings were replaced by digital scenes and extended fly-bies. These films were then issued on DVD in 2004 and contained yet more alterations - the 1997 version of Jabba the Hutt in the first film was replaced by a more 'accurate to the prequels ' version of Jabba while the voice of Boba Fett was replaced by the dude who'd played his father in the prequels and quite frankly there are other changes because the ghost of Anakin at the end of Return of the Jedi is now Hayden Christensen instead of the original actor and if I recall correctly, Greedo still shoots first at Han and misses, but now by less. In summary : these movies have gone through multiple iterations and while fans like myself may not be representative of the average person, underneath this there is the story of George Lucas, a man who for whatever reason released a groundbreaking movie / movies once and has for whatever reason never felt the desire to just leave them alone. And now there's a bluray release. And guess what? The original trilogy gets more revisions. A formerly silent Vader who wordlessly turns on his master at the absolute climax of the film in Return of the Jedi now screams \\"NOooooo!!\\" while doing so.Why? Why, George? Sure, it's his to do with as he pleases. But I think if Leonardo da Vinci was alive today and wanted to redo the Mona Lisa every couple of years, eventually the Louvre might tell him that with all due respect, sir, you're making a fool of yourself. I know I don't have to buy these films if I don't want to... and i don't. I would have liked to have heard a better sound and seen sharper visuals than the rather poor 'original versions' released as an afterthought / limited edition in 2008, but if I'm asked to pay yet more money for butchered version of the original trilogy and the prequels I hate then... I simply won't. But I do feel compelled to provide a review of the movie, as a fan who is looking at it and saying that these are not the films I wanted to buy, and are packaged as ones that I would have.
0345495004|4.0|Being from Wisconsin...having grown up in an area where FLW was very well known and loved, his was a name I heard all the time.  As I got older and began spending more and more time both in the Chicago area and later Spring Green, WI, I became fascinated by THIS story.  A visit to Taliesin (not West) will give some indication of how much of the story has not been told.  Tour the house and the FLW visitor's center and what is MOST obvious is what is NOT said about the history of Wright and Mamah.  I enjoyed the book, and loved the idea that these things MIGHT have happened this way.  It is not hard to imagine conversations between Frank and Mamah, each lamenting the lost relationships with their respective children.  Perhaps I've been down some unusual roads in my life, but I could most certainly relate to the idea of \\"the one\\"....who is not \\"the one you're with\\".      Knowing how the story was going to end didn't make it any easier to accept that they---Mamah, her children, the loyal workers---were dead.  But the narration in the book left me cold and disappointed.  After all the internal dialogue Mamah has regarding Ellen Key, as well as her time lost with her children, it seems odd the author chose NOT to give us any insight into those moments when she KNEW she was dying...the fraction of a second after the realization that the fire was lethal, but before she saw that her children would die too.      Finally, I found the description of what Frank did afterwards lacking as well.  How her grave is marked on the grounds of family chapel is poetic...that the tree there was specifically planted in order to be seen from Frank's bedroom window is again, heartbreaking. None of this is mentioned in the book, and is rarely discussed, even amongst \\"locals\\" at Taliesin.  Why is that?  It would seem to me that a novel might want to go where reality only peeks around the corner.      All that being said, I enjoyed this book.  It's not a technical masterpiece, but it IS a good story.  Internal monologues aren't always fascinating, but they are real.  In the end, Mamah and Frank appears to strive for the REAL in each of themselves individually, as well as in their relationship.
0545265355|5.0|These books are an amazing read for all people.  I've never met anyone who hasn't liked them. They are thrilling and have amazingly developed characters.  You will love these books. READ!!!
B003ZSJ212|2.0|It's hard to review something that is not even out yet, but thanks to Amazon we can.  We know for instance the changes made before this is even out.  Sad part of this whole thing is people are going to buy this set.  They will use the excuse \\"I am a die hard, and the new deleted scenes enticed me into it\\".  Well here is a thought, in about an hour the deleted scenes will be up on Youtube and you will not have to give George Lucas your money!!  Some poor sap will do that for you.  Plus if you want to see all the changes Youtube will have that I am sure in clips.  Save your money, SAVE STAR WARS!!  Make this the set that George wakes up on, if we as fans SAY \\"NO!! We will not buy this\\" and he loses money on it.  He might just wake up and see that releasing what we fans want is in his best interest. Maybe we should all converge on \\"Sky Walker Ranch\\" and picket and protest, but who am I kidding?  We are all fat and lazy and stupid. George knows this, that's why he will continue to make this crap because he will make money.
B004ZZS4CC|1.0|I purchased this book on my Kindle. If I had to do it over again, I would not have bought it. The book doesn't really tell anything that hasn't been in the media. I didn't think it was a well written book.
1451629184|5.0|The beginning of this book is the hardest to read. Just to imagine the day she was kidnapped, and the \\"first time\\" was horrible. She explains it as she at that time her feelings and what she was thinking. It is told from a child's point of view and it just makes you feel so bad for her.    Some parts actually tell of some happiness she felt during those 18 years. they bought her things, books, a rocker for her baby, all the baby stuff she asked for. (She even had candy to eat). It leaves you feeling a little relieved to think her whole time there wasn't torture, so to speak and they did take care of her and her girls (as much as monsters can that is).      Later in the book it explains how the garridos brainwashed her into thinking the outside world was evil and they were the only ones that could take care of her and her girls.     After reading it, I still don't fully understand why she didn't try to escape. They had taken her in public, after her girls were born, yet she says \\"no one noticed me\\". By then she had grown and changed and they had died and cut her hair. But she is trained to help keep their secret, so she doesn't say anything to anyone. At one point she is in the house when a probation officer comes to do his check up on phillip. She doesn't say anything then either. I found myself telling her to stand up and tell the officer who you are and what those horrible people did to you! Even when they finally do get rescued, the police ask her her name and she says Allisa (her new name). She even asks to talk to phillip, she asks him what she should do, what to say to the police.     I would recommend this book, even if you do not want to read about the early years when it was the worst for her. It is written with details, yet not all of them, just to give the reader an idea of what she went through. She tells of her thoughts at the time, what she thought about what was happening.
B00102FELM|4.0|Yes, this DVD has been out a long time, and yes, I just got it as I continue to round out my concert DVD/Blu-Ray library.  Not sure why it took me so long to order this (I LOVE the Scorps!), but it may have to do with the fact that they have several concert DVDs.  I struggled with which one to get.  Finally settled on Wacken AND Acoustica (complementary shows), and I am not disappointed.  Wacken is incredibly well-performed, as the guys do seem to be enjoying themselves.  For volume of songs itself, this is a great collection.  But, the song choices are great, too, spanning a broad range of years as they should.    I am with other reviewers, however, in disliking the frenetic camera angle switching.  It's cool to have tons of angles, but focus longer than 2 seconds on each shot, please!  It almost gives me motion sickness (not really!).  One last visual gripe is the overall darkness of the stage.  Not sure if this was the show or how it was filmed or edited, but it's just really dark except the sharp spotlights.  Not a big deal at all, but seems like it's unintended.  The audio is great except the bass is really pumping compared to other concerts I have.  No big deal, I just back off on the subwoofer a touch.    All in all, very happy and wishing I would have bought this years ago!
0061537969|5.0|I'm a sucker for dog stories, having cried over the loss of every dog I've owned. So, when my friend Dave bought me a copy during a business trip I began consuming the story knowing from the get go I'd cry at the end. Stein gets credit for a novel telling of the story by using the dog Enzo named after the Ferrari creator Enzo Ferrari. It's a story near and dear to my heart because it chronicles how a man facing a generous portion of adversity is supported by his best friend, survives and excels thanks also to the help of a Ferrari executive who also lost a wife early in life and was bound by a promise to the great Enzo himself to help another. This book is a great escape from the dangerous world we live in now.
0451196716|5.0|Reason for Reading:  I'm in the process of of re/reading all of Stephen King's works in chronological order.  This was the next book in line.<br /><br />I originally read \\"The Long Walk\\" when King released his omnibus of \\"The Bachman Books\\" in 1985.  Of the four novels \\"The Long Walk\\" and \\"The Running Man\\" were my favourites and I was looking forward to this re-read.  Initially, the book struck a chord with me because even back in the eighties I could imagine a world where game shows had turned to life or death.  Of course, now, in the 21st century, with reality shows that embarrass, degrade, hurt and sometimes seriously injure participants physically and/or emotionally; the life and death scenario is not so hard to imagine in today's death culture and in fact has already been done with the mock abortion reality show \\"Bump\\".<br /><br />In \\"The Long Walk\\" we are in a future America, which has a dictator and a military presence, we know only that some event happened in the past for things to turn out this way.  Boys from the age of 14 to 17 are allowed to enter the annual Long Walk, from which 100 contestants are chosen.  The event is a national spectacle and parts of it are aired on TV and millions of dollars are exchanged in bets on who will be the winner.  The book focuses on the race from one participant's point of view and we experience the physical, emotional and mental hardships and breakdowns that these boys suffer.  Penalty for slipping below 4 miles per hour during the walk results in a warning every thirty seconds, after the 3rd warning, their is a 30 second countdown and the loser is shot dead and carried away.  The game ends when one contestant remains alive.  I really appreciated the psychological insight into the Walkers as a whole group and as individuals; the dynamics as they broke down into small groups, pairs and loners; and the examination of the varying effects that the psychological and physical torture had on different individuals.  Probably my favourite of all the Bachman books, but I'll have to reread them all before I make a definite decision.  A reread that lived up to my expectations.the Bachman books, but I'll have to reread them all before I make a definite decision.  A reread that lived up to my expectations.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Blinking Ewoks? Really?<br /><br />George Lucas took a masterpiece and has ruined it. On top of that he doesn't give his audience the option of having the original versions. He crams these horrible \\"fixes\\" down our throat and expects us to pay big money for them.<br /><br />The more I see from Lucas, the more I feel like the original trilogy was his biggest mistake that ended up being a hit.<br /><br />EDIT: Here is a link with some of the non sense changes that people may have not seen yet:[...]
B002ZG97EC|5.0|I have watched this movie about 8 times and I still love it.  The minions were so funny and adorable.  I want to adopt one.  This movie is definitely worth watching and is suitable for all ages.  It's nice to watch a movie that is so entertaining and enjoyable.  It was well written and the animation was superb. I can't say enough about it.  I would rate this 10 stars.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|The original 3 Star Wars movies (Episodes 4-6) are classic masterpieces.  Why would he want to change pivotal plots?  It was bad enough that Lucas deleted Sebastian Shaw's warm portrayal (and his eyebrows) as the elder Anakin Skywalker from the last scene of ROJ and instead added Hayden Christensen's stoic, drug addict look.    Why not instead make improvements on Episodes 1 and 2?  First how about adding scenes where Jar Jar Binks is killed or perhaps prolong the lightsaber fight between Qui Gon Jin & Obi-Wan vs Darth Maul.  THAT is how you make things better!    Shame on you Mr. Lucas!
0060263857|5.0|Reason for Reading:  Read aloud to ds.<br /><br />I'll keep this one short.  There must be thousand's of reviews already of this modern classic.  The edition that I have is the hardcover reprint with the gently colourized original illustration by Rosemary Wells, a beautiful book and a keeper for my personal library.  This was my first re-read since my original reading as a child and it struck me again as being a wonderful book so full of feeling, even though I'd seen the cartoon movie year after year as a child.  I was surprised that Fern wasn't really that big a part of the story as I had expected her to be and Templeton was all Paul Lynde to me.  I heard his voice every time he spoke!<br /><br />This was my son's first exposure to Charlotte's Web.  I've kept him away from the new version of the movie purposely until we'd read the book and the animated version just doesn't show up on TV like it used to.  I wouldn't say say he absolutely loved it.  He didn't cry are feel bad at the end, at all.  It was very much \\"c'est la vie\\" for him.  But he did laugh at all the funny parts and enjoyed Wilbur as a character the most.  Oh, and the geese, he loved their double talk!  So he enjoyed the book and we've got a hold on the animated movie version at the library to watch and will watch the newer real life version if he's interested afterwards for comparison. (I personally do not like talking animal movies).  For myself it was a great enjoyment to re-acquaint myself with the original book and remember why E.B. White was such a beloved children's author.  Why did he have to leave us with only three children's books, though??  That is the sad part.  The Trumpet of the Swan is still my favourite of the three.
0060833459|4.0|Great book on leadership and management including insights for better time management, setting priorities and helping managers make effective decisions, including innovative strategies and ideas.<br />Very helpful book with great advice. I recommend all managers and executive read this book - no matter how experienced, you are sure to gain a few gold nuggets.<br /><br />-Gary Perman<br />President<br />PermanTech
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Don't order this Blu Ray, unless you don't mind the alterations that completely ruin the story.  I want the restored originals in all their Blu Ray glory, not these destroyed, modern-day Lucas abominations.  Lucas is trying hard to make the originals as stupid as the prequel trilogy.    Also - If you notice, Amazon has mixed up the reviews from previously released versions into the reviews for this Blu Ray.  A pretty sneaky and unethical decision to try and boost sales.  The REAL count as of 9/7/2011 for the BLU RAY version is:    1 star - 56 votes  2 stars - 6 votes  3 stars - 5 votes  4 stars - 8 votes  5 stars - 17 votes    Average: 2 stars
B0058OUJA4|5.0|A challenging game that I've been enjoying thoroughly. It's as much about controlling the flow of the creeps as what types of towers you place and upgrade.
B004QITJC2|5.0|The Best Metal Cd I've Heard In A Long Time.....It's Like Iron Maiden & Judas Priest Meet Cadle Of Filth...Well..Something Like That...Loving It To Death.....
B003ZSJ212|1.0|For the sole reason that it still is the \\"definitive\\" version. It has the best picture of an unaltered release which is sad to the say the least.     I was ready to buy the Blu Ray collection even with Han shooting first until I heard of Darth Vader yelling \\"NOOOOOO\\" at the end of RTOJ.     I'm definitely not a fanboy, but I refuse to buy these as long as Lucas has slung even more abuse upon \\"his\\" films.    Instead of bowdlerization of books as in the 19th century, we have \\"lucasization\\" of landmark films.
B0042SSO1I|1.0|THIS DVD SEASON 3 WAS NOT WHAT IT SEEMED. THERE WERE FROM A DIFFERENT REGION AND ME BEING A NEW CUSTOMER OF DOING THIS HAD NO IDEA THAT THERE WERE OTHER REGIONS OUT THERE THAT WONT PLAY IN A AMERICAN DVD PLAYER. SO BUYER BE WARE CHEAPER DOESN'T MEAN A THING IF IT WON'T PLAY AND THEN YOU CAN'T GET ANYONE TO HELP YOU GET YOUR MONEY RETURNED. WHICH IS NOW MY BIGGEST REGRET.!!!!! INFORMATION IS ONLY THROUGH EMAIL. I GAVE THEM MY PHONE NUMBER AND STILL NO ONE CALLS. I NEED HELP AND SUGGESTIONS TO WHAT TO DO NOW. PLEASE AND THANK YOU.
B004YEJGEO|5.0|One of my favorite games on Android. Very clever little puzzle game. I got it when it was the free app of the day, but would gladly spend money on a sequel if / when they make one.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I must agree that some of the additions to the original Star Wars trilogy were good.  Some were all right.  A lot was just wrong.  I mean what's with the slapstick comedy?  Can't we enjoy these movies without over-the-top drama?  Please, just clean them up and leave them alone.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|There is no way I will purchase another box set if I only get the altered version. Sorry Georgie boy. I don't want to see the epic scene of Darth saving his son ruined with some cheesy screaming dialog. Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, and I hate that you change things in a trilogy that's 30 years old. Maybe you could just update the original unbastardized version to bluray?
B004LL1HM4|5.0|The Fleet Foxes self titled debut was probably my favorite \\"new music\\" album of my life so far, actually. It was 2008 when their first album came out and I was just at the age when music really started mattering in my life.. Meaning more. That cd has been through a lot. Hundreds and hundreds of plays. From then until now. Their new album was released and it's just as good as their first. Helplessness Blues is a fantastic album. Now stop readin and get it!
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|I have to say this movie may have very well ruined the genre for me. Why? Because it's so good. I don't think I'll ever be able to sit through another movie about some guy who accidentally becomes a villain because of some horrible event, such as every villain in Spiderman. The Dark Knight is the first movie (of this genre)I can remember in a long long time that actually has a bad guy in it. I'm not even a big Heath Ledger fan but I cannot deny his perfect portrayal of the Joker.     And it's not all about the Joker. Everyone in this movie gives a top performance. I'm just keeping my fingers crossed that if they make anymore of these they stick to this format instead of going back to the campy \\"just throw as many big name actors on the screen as you can\\" Batman movies.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|What a shame!! 1 Star! to bad Amazon docent give the option of a \\"0\\" Star o well the worst thing about this is that this box set will sell like hot cakes for sure and Lucas wont learn the lesson still, people you'll have to wait until 2020 to see the originals since a second batch of bluray's will be released with the 3D conversion, hope that by 2020 i am still alive and not blind...or interested in Star Wars anyway, until then people!
B0054N73EY|5.0|First off, let me just say this is a MUST have RHCP album. I must admit, at first I thought this would be a continuation of Stadium Arcadium.. That Josh would try his best to completely mimic John's sound and style. He didn't.. And I am grateful that he didn't. The songs are written beautifully with many complexities and new instrumentation. It still retains the classic sounding Peppers feel and sound, which I love. I give it 5/5 stars it's an excellent album, really. Great job Red Hot Chili Peppers.
0439023513|5.0|I thought the Hunger Games trilogy would be more adolescent and immature reading than it is.  But it surprised me, it is well written and makes the reader think.  A great book for anyone interested in post-apocalyptic fiction. I read all three and wish there were more.  The different characters are more complex and interesting than expected.  A great read, no matter your age.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Really? MORE changes? I'm done with this nonsense, I am HAPPY with the REGULAR special edition. THIS IS RIDICULOUS, BOYCOTT BOYCOTT BOYCOTT!!!!
0316067938|1.0|Lmao!!!! Meyer is one of the greatest con artist of all times! She writes Twilight makes people go crazy then when she get the money the movie deals and the whole ya-dig she says F$%# the con i'm tired and leaves her loyal fans with the worse piece of, whatever, ever created. God i bet after every page of mindless drivel and image of Meyer, flipping you off holding a wad of cash, flashed in your mind. Honestly a vampire baby? Really? Really? That seemed like a good idea? Make clumsy Bella a mom? and Jacob? What did the poor boy do to piss you off that you turned him into a pedophile? Why oh why didn't James eat Bella when he had the chance? Meyer if I could find you, I would mot likely hurt you.
B004NSULHM|5.0|When I first found out Radiohead would be putting out a new album I was ecstatic.. And to find out it would be released in just about a week!?? Awesome! So, I waited that week or whatever it was, downloaded the album, burned it on to a disc, and popped it in my bangin' surround sound music system. Couldn't wait.. It started and I was hooked immediately. From the MOMENT that ambient piano tinkering came in. And LOVED the rest of the cd from start to finish. It's got a great Radiohead groove to it, with a ton of subtle and haunting complexities. Thom's melodies and lyrics are infectious.. Great, great album. Radiohead has done it again!
B0054S6N04|5.0|Great book. I recommend reading it. Full of suspense and intrigue, very well written. If you like Linda Howard you will love this book.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|The fact that they made cruddy blinking looking ewoks, a horrible cgi yoda in TPM, thats ok, ill take it, but chaning Vaders silent moment as he throws the emperor like a water melon chunking contest? We are suppose to wonder whats going on in Vaders mind, when he yelled no more Padme it was a young imature moment of a young vader. now in the return of the jedi we have a much older, wiser Vader. To think he would scream noo! again... i will miss watching this wondering what vader is thinking as he is picking up the emperor, the no just makes it to straight forward, is lucas dumbing down the trilogies? i belive so.
B00005NNMJ|5.0|This is one of the best albums in heavy metal history, must have. Sound seems perfect on this remastered edition, bonus tracks are quite interesting. The only problem is the cover that is not work-safe and may rise questions among your colleagues.  The price is really cheap.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Well George, from the looks of these other reviews, you finally killed Star Wars for even the most die-hard defenders of your CGI schlockfest.      I had already cancelled my pre-order before I heard about the NOOOOOOOOOO scene in ROTJ, and this bit of news makes me all the more happy that I did.  Just add it to the list of bad decisions made for \\"improving\\" these films.  Greedo shooting first, the deleted Jabba scene at Mos Eisley, Boba Fett's lines being redone by Temuera Morrison, the APPALLING Jedi Rocks sequence at Jabba's Palace, Hayden Christensen instead of Sebastion Shaw at the end of Jedi.....and now this.  The only things I don't mind are touch-ups like the windows in Bespin and the new Wampa arm fix, and the new Emperor/Vader scene in Empire.  The new Yoda in TPM is ok too.  The NOOOOOOOOOO at the end of ROTS isn't even that bad to me but it absolutely destroys the tension in Jedi, along with John Williams' emotional score.    They may look crappy, but I'm so glad I have the \\"bonus disc\\" originals on DVD from a few years back.   NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO George, you won't be getting my money on this one.
B00003CX8N|5.0|This is a story about the long relationship between the New York writer and bibliophile, Helen Hanff and Frank Doel, a British bookseller whose shop is located at 84 Charing Cross Road in London.  It is delicious to watch these two accomplished actors (Anne Bancroft and Sir Anthony Hopkins respectively) take us through the association between two people who are rather different in nature, but who share a love of books and, eventually via a two decade correspondence, share the great events which are a part of their daily lives.  The lasting and extraordinary friendship between Frank and Helen is brought to life as these two great actors ply their craft in a way that teachs us much about life, caring and love, specifically, the love of books.  We learn that books reveal much about the world and those who inhabit it through their contents; and that books can enrich lives during the scarcity suffered in a world war and bring sanity and moral committment during the social upheaval of the sixties.     This movie is full of laughter and tears while never being maudlin, adulterous or shallow.  It is a great movie at a great price and available from Amazon.    Susan Johnston
B003ZSJ212|1.0|So unlike many other Star Wars fans, I wasn't greatly bothered by the changes made in the 2004 DVD release. Disappointing as they were, they were too minor to ruin such otherwise great movies for me (although the CGI sarlacc was really dumb). However, this release is an entirely different matter. One of the best scenes in Film history where Darth Vader is finally redeemed is completely ruined by the insertion of Darth Vader yelling \\"NOOOO\\" several times. It messes up the entire suspense of the scene and turns it into nothing but a joke. I don't want the next generation to grow up watching this version which why I urge everyone to rate this set 1 star. Casual fans of the series or parents looking to buy this for their kids need to know that this is not the version to go with. Why can't Lucas just release the remastered originals? I've been a lifelong Star Wars fan and and it looks like I have finally joined the Lucas haters.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|The most successful hack in Hollywood history has done it again: doctoring the episodes IV, V, and VI, in an attempt to \\"perfect\\" what was already perfect in 1977, 1980, and 1983, respectively.     The newly-added \\"NOOOOO!\\" as Vader stops the Emperor from torturing Luke is the worst change since Hayden replaced Sebastian Shaw at the end of 'Jedi.' The removal of Shaw from the Jedi ghosts was enough for me to never watch the Special Editions again.     As a fan of the original, unaltered Star Wars movies, I will have to make due with my non-anamorphic DVDs that were included as a \\"bonus\\" last time the individual movies were released. They don't look great, standard definition, zoomed-in to fill the widescreen TV, but to be honest, the hack has so thoroughly turned me off from Star Wars that I can't really imagine ever watching the movies again.    The Special Editions were cool to see in theaters in 1997, but I never thought at the time that the movies were to become a \\"work in progress\\" for the hack to continue messing with for every reissue. I won't waste my money on anything Star Wars related again. The hack has gotten enough of my money.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|It would be no big deal if the original versions were actually included, but the fact they aren't just makes this inexcusable.
B00003CXC6|5.0|Akira Kurasawa may be the greatest director of all time and it is very presumptuous of me to attempt to rate this film.  I had seen it several times on TCM and decided that I needed to be able to see it frequently to try and discover all the nuances of this extraordinary film.  Basically, Kurasawa uses some of his best company actors, notably Toshiro Mifune, Takashi Shimura and Minoru Chiaki with cinematographer Miyagawa and musician Fumio Hayasaka to create one of the best films ever made.      The story of a rape and a murder is told through the eyes of three different people, three different points of view and three different realities or truths.  The viewer must decide what really happened and whether what happened really matters in the overall scheme of things.  Are people and events ever really what they seem to be on the surface?  The black and white cinematography is dazzling, the music brilliant and the plot unfolds in a very masterful way with the viewer forced to look more carefully at the inherent qualities of truth and at the nature of humanity.    This is a marvelous film with great commentary so that even the uninitiated need not fear a lack of understanding.  This great film is available at Amazon for a great price...an offer you cannot refuse!    Susan Johnston
B003ZSJ212|1.0|If you release the originals all of this madness will stop.  You can continue to update the special editions until you are 90 years old and nobody will care as long as the originals are there alongside them. I could go on and on and be unprofessional about it all but this is all that needs to be said and all that needs to be done.
B00008G9JN|5.0|Some people love Jethro Tull. Some people hate Jethro Tull. Some people love and hate Jethro Tull. I am not a big Jethro Tull fan by any stretch. Spending my teenage years in the '70s meant that I could not escape hearing Tull everywhere especially on FM radio of the time. Songs From The Wood was released during my senior year of high school, at a time when heavy metal was more to my taste. Hearing these folksy, woodsy tunes served as a nice respite. It's been literally decades since I last heard this, but fond memories were rekindled so I downloaded this. Wow, how those memories came flooding back. I am not afraid to say that I love this CD and I cannot find a single bad thing to say about it. I enjoy every song from the original album. The bonus tracks I can do without. Beltane doesn't match up to the original songs, and live versions of songs already on the CD are esoteric. I love this album! I know I'll listen to it again and again and enjoy it like an old friend. Thank you, Ian Anderson, for this gift.
0670022411|1.0|I started this book with a lot of excitement. The first 100 pages or so were great, however, the writer took a turn for the worse, introducing too many characters and different plot lines.  She never followed through on any of the characters she introduced.  The book almost felt like a run on sentence.    I was extremely disappointed.  This book was sort of comparable to the \\"Twilight\\" series with a woman falling in love with a vampire and then giving up her life and her self for him.  She lets him control her and protect her even though she is supposed to be an extremely powerful witch.  She is supposed to be an Oxford professor with her doctorate, but this is completely forgotten after about 200 pages or so when she becomes obsessed with her vampire soul mate.      This is definitely one of the most ridiculous and annoying books I have read in a long long time!!
B0054N73EY|2.0|There are some really decent songs on here, Happiness Loves Company and Did I Let You Know are very catchy...but the recording is LIFELESS! Why are such accomplished artists ruining their music by letting people dynamically compress the snot out of it.<br /><br />Honestly, you turn this up for more than a couple minutes on a decent hifi system and your ears start hurting because everything is just one loud compressed mess.<br /><br />Here's a quick comparison:<br /><br />DYNAMICALLY ALIVE ALBUMS 1984 ~ 1992 (CD only)<br /><br />1) Blood Sugar Sex Magik - average dynamic range - 14dB<br />2) What Hits?! - average dynamic range - 13dB<br />3) The Red Hot Chili Peppers - average dynamic range - 13dB<br />4) Freaky Styley - average dynamic range - 14dB<br />5) The Uplift Mofo Party Plan - average dynamic range 13dB<br /><br />DYNAMICALLY AWFUL ALBUMS 1999 ~ 2011 (CD only)<br /><br />1) Californication - average dynamic range - 4dB<br />2) By The Way - average dynamic range - 6dB<br />3) Stadium Arcadium - average dynamic range - 5dB<br />4) I'm With You - average dynamic range - 4dB<br /><br />Such a shame.<br /><br />I can only hope that Steve Hoffman and Kevin Gray might be cutting a vinyl of this at some point that saves the dynamics of the original tapes like the cut they did of Stadium Arcadium which puts the CD to utter shame. I look forward to the day when this ridiculous style of mastering is a bad memory.<br /><br />EDIT - perhaps there were tape back-ups, but the vinyl was cut from 24/96 masters which would be okay too if they weren't dynamically devoid of life but unfortunately that doesn't appear to be the case, the vinyl sounds almost as bad as the CD. Not surprising, as Vlado Meller did the same thing with the new Jane's Addiction album also. The only reason I don't give this 1-star is because the song-writing is actually good, shame Meller has prevented us from enjoying it on everything but a crappy factory car stereo or cheapie in-ear bud .mp3 player.
0553801473|5.0|Great series, and this book is one of the best of the series. I highly recommend this series for any fan of any genre of reading.
B000002VRZ|5.0|This was my first listen ever to The Outlaws.  Blew my mind! Arista's remastering is excellent.  If you have high end stereo equipment it really brings the music to you. What a kick-a$$ group!
B004SBX112|5.0|Great game, but the September update doesn't seem to want to update. Shows the new icon, levels pictured &amp; release date, but where ot should say &quot;Update&quot; it just says &quot;Open.&quot; What gives? I suppose I'll be removing a couple stars if this isn't fixed soon.
B004PVKFR8|5.0|First song I heard was 'Sail' and instantly felt it!! I youtubed them and listened to the rest of their songs, and think the entire album is awesome. I hate to buy a whole album because of one good song, and end up only liking that one song, and hating the rest of the album; Not the case with these guys. I like all of Awolnations songs. If you are a fan of good music, definitly buy this album!!!!!
B002WIDRM6|5.0|I love this CD... every single song. It is one of my all time favorites. I feel like a couple of the songs are straight out of my life. Highly recommend!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Ewoks blinking is alright. However, instead of making Vader repeat his cheesy \\"NOOOO!\\" from episode III, how about you make the Ewoks' mouths move. They are still the most phony looking characters in the whole trilogy.    However, the real problem with this set is that they continue to tinker with the dramatic stuff. Remember when Han shot first? That established him as a rogue who wasn't afraid of cheating to win a fight. Making Greedo shoot first, was awkward in how it was done, as well as confusing. It also changes Han's character.     Same with the cheesy \\"NOOOO!\\" for Vader. The silent mask watching Luke die allowed the audience to interpret what was going on in Vader's head. You could almost see the gears turning in his brain.     By having him say \\"Noo. NOOOO!\\" you rob the audience of that great moment of film.     Ever since the prequels its like Lucas feels everything has to be spoon fed to fans. All three prequels it went like this:  First the characters say what they're going to do.   Then they do it  Then they explain what they just did.     Nothing is open to interpretation, which takes away the impact of the films.     They'll probably change the great \\"I love you\\" \\"I know\\" exchange in Empire to \\"I love you to.\\"
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Lucas, you buffoon, \\"The Silence Must Be Heard\\" was the title of an Enigma song, NOT A DIRECTIVE TO MAKE ANOTHER CHANGE TO THE ORIGINAL MOVIE.
B0054N73EY|2.0|get the funk punk back ..simple...! They lost it after Hillel died. What i liked about them in the 80's was thier funk/punk sound gone is that and replaced with white boy soul music. I wouldn't say this album sucks but it's not the RHCP. They could throw in at least two or three funk/punk songs but they can't even do that anymore. What would it hurt? They could keep their old fans and keep their new fans too. I don't it get, their ballads and anthony being sober destroyed their anger and fun side. But if you like mellow soul music than this is a good album. I miss Hillel Slovak and their 80's funk fusion. Josh my advice but some distortion on that guitar.
B0014I4KH6|5.0|Love the young singer's voice, music, and lyrics. It is currently on my favorites list. This is just good listening and singing along when you are on the long drives.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|This movie lays the foundation for The Dark Knight. If you don't own it yet, shame on you! On its own, this is a fine movie. It tends to get a bit comic booky in the third act, but overall it's a great film.
B002V9PEUE|5.0|[[ASIN:B002V9PEUE Cliffhanger [Blu-ray]]]<br />This is definately one of the best films Stallone ever made.<br />The acting is good, and since this is before CGI, the special effects<br />are outstanding. John Lithgow is delicious as the heavy, and The other<br />actors can carry their weight in this exciting action film.<br />I highly recomend this crystal clear picture, and 5.1 Blu-Ray DVD.<br />It looks great on my big screen, but it will look great on any TV.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I can't wait to see these movies. Screw the nostalgia factor, that's why I have the original VHS. As far as I'm concerned, any alterations made to the film just bring it closer to the original vision George Lucas just could not achieve for the original release.    By the way, Just putting the original theatrical releases on Blu-Ray doesn't make them HD. They still have to be remastered, so either settle for crappy analog technology, or stop complaining about changes.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|Loved a couple songs and currently in my CD player.Some just a bit bluesy for my taste but all over... good listening. Arrived quick too.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Here's the deal.   When you do something like erase a mat line, or add blinking to Ewoks, it doesn't hurt the movie. It helps it.     When you add dialog, or change the sequence of events, it changes the movie and its impact. So while I'm all for the Special Edition changes like expanding Cloud City or fixing bad effects shots, things like making Vader say \\"NOOO!\\" in Jedi by clearly using the same exact piece of audio that was in Episode III are stupid and hurt the impact of the film.     The films were fine as they were. If you want to polish the effects because you couldn't do so in 1983, fine. But changing the context of scenes ... it just hurts the legacy of these films. The Vader sequence at the end of Jedi that has been changed was one of the few perfect moments in that film. Throwing in the \\"NOOO!\\" from Episode III is cheesy and makes no sense.     It's like Lucasfilm has never seen or understands the emotional impact of scenes.
B002VKE1K2|5.0|THAT'S how scary it was! I just love the whole horror genre, and 99 times out of 100, when the scary thing is revealed, I feel like snorting with laughter, especially at big goo dripping aliens, pea soup vomit, oceans of blood or teenagers getting slashed. To me the sign of a good scare is one that it stays with you a long, long time: witness the thousands who still flash back to the knife wielding Anthony Perkins while taking a shower at a Budget 8. It's been a few years since seeing PA, and sometimes when all is quiet at 2AM,  I will get the thought as I'm falling asleep, what will I do if  the hall light suddenly turns on?  To each his own, but this movie REALLY got to me and stayed there.
B004SKLFJS|4.0|Michael Flatley gives his audiences a non stop rush of dancing and music.  It is great entertainment and a very nice way to spend an evening with a date or alone.
B002G01EPC|5.0|Great toy! Wonderful paint job and articulation! You can pose this guy in so many ways! Beautiful details for a 6 inch figure! Really nice to look at than play with I'd say because parts may fall off and get lost while you play with it. Got here a day later then the estimated date but oh well. All in all, GREAT figure!
B003ZSJ212|2.0|What year is this!!!??!!! C'mon, George, my old player's gonna' break someday! Remaster those puppies and slap on DTS, sell them as their own box set and watch them FLY OFF THE SHELVES...
B0001Z37HM|5.0|The series though a lot campier then the two Conan movies was still a guilty pleasure to watch,  and now after so long we get to experience the campy adventure again on the dvd format.  The movie and other fantasy movies that flooded the 80's brought enough entertainment for the aforementioned genre types of movies as well as tried to open Hollywood's film companies to a new starlet Bridgette Nielsen trying to make her solo movie debut but which sadly fell flat.  The movie basic story is you have a young female farmers daughter who after scaring a dark-hearted queen who wanted the farmer's girl was then forced to watch as her family is killed before her and then is raped by the queens guards,  but surviving this horrific assault makes a vow to become a great warrior and take her revenge on the dark queen.  Of course with this kind of movie you can't have the heroine travel without a couple of sidekicks which she meets up with later and who join her with their own vendettas of retribution against the dark queen,  one of these sidekicks is none other then the former Conan actor Arnold Schwarzenegger though he doesn't play Conan in this movie and out of the the group of hero's the two who actually turned out to be the better actors wasn't Arnold or Bridgette but the young boy king played by Ernie Reyes Jr.  and his protector played by Paul L.Smith.  The effects as expected are campy but as this is an 80's movie it's forgivable also the action is decent enough but don't expect fight scenes like with Batman The Dark Knight and the like.  All I can say after this is if you're a fan of the campy 80's movie or a fan of the Conan series here's a nice add on to your collection but if you're still undecided try to find a couple of trailers online to make your choice afterwords...
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Like the rest i grew up on these movies (the first 3) and cant believe he added more changes...at first i didnt mind the changes to the space battles...cause i love that but the rest of the movies were fine without the updates and now there just terrible...good thing the originals can be found in HD if you look in the right places! :)

1400069181|3.0|Blake (not Tom) Mycloskie has written a short but fairy satisfying book that is part company history and part motivational business guide. The nice twist from Mycloskie's perspective is his belief that we are in an era where private companies can directly address public concerns in a constructive way that is mutually beneficial. Most of his ideas seem to be more geared towards new companies and generating inspiration for a way to serve customers and a charitable cause, but he tries to acknowledge that its never a bad time to do a good thing.<br /><br />The part that I found the most interesting was his description of just how barebones you can (and probably should) be when a company is still struggling make it past year one. His stories of handing off the same phone to different people in the same apartment to \\"transfer departments\\" is rather entertaining, and for someone who is still pondering the possibilities, this lays it out pretty plainly. Most people will believe you're the real deal with only a few things, a decent business card, a good website and a clear message. His message about how to treat employees and customers as part of the \\"family\\" of the company is also inspiring, he sounds like a great guy to work for or with.<br /><br />I don't much care for the format that Blake borrows from a number of different motivational books where he'll start a chapter out with \\"let me tell you a story\\" then give you some anecdote that touches on the topic that he's going to cover in detail in that chapter. Its been done to death and I find most anecdotes to be rather uninteresting (I'm interested in HIS insight, not someone else's story).<br /><br />I would only recommend a buy for someone who finds the TOMS story in itself to be interesting. The overall tone is that of one long motivational speech, which isn't bad at times, but you can get that just about anywhere. I'm glad I got a free review copy. This would make a good library read, but I don't think this book offers enough unique value to warrant purchasing. Its good, with a good message, but not great.o warrant purchasing. Its good, with a good message, but not great.

B005COO1X6|5.0|\\"Mile 81' is a new Kindle e-book from author Stephen King. This book is a 213 Kb download and is price at $2.99.<br /><br />SPOILERS (general theme...no specific details given)<br /><br />At an abandoned rest stop at the Mile 81 exit ramp on I-95 between Portland and Augusta, Maine, a new object of horror has just arrived. This is the story of six different people or groups who are unfortunate enough to be in the the wrong place at the wrong time on that fateful day.<br /><br />END SPOILERS<br /><br />A story that was maybe a little slow to start, but once begun, unravels a tale of spine tingling suspense and dread. I like King's writing style for these type of his shorter works...more substance and perfectly paced. It has none of the 'fill' that appears to take up a substantial amount of space in some of his longer works; 'fill' that I have often found brings that incredible chilling atmosphere and tension to a grinding halt.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />A brilliant, short horror story from Stephen King.<br />Readable in less than an hour but, to me, more satisfying that many of his longer works.<br />5 Stars<br /><br />Ray Nicholson
0439023521|4.0|I was hooked on this book in the first couple pages and could not stop reading it.  What I love about it is that it keeps your attention (you are constantly dying to know what is going to happen next) and it also has important messages about economic oppression and tyranny.  Often when I am reading I have to sacrifice intellectual meaning to get fast paced thriller type material.  What I love about this book is that it has both.  I 100% recommend reading it!  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I reserve 5 stars for the very best.  The Hunger Games is very close to that level though.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Lucas...I know you don't care what we or your staff think. I know you will never read this. You have ruined what was already a so-so film in Jedi.
B005EPFA8I|3.0|When I watch a documentary I always hope that it will answer the questions that I would have asked had I been there to access the experts. A good is example is the odd animal and woman combination found on one pillar. I wanted them to go a little deeper into its possible meaning. Instead I got a rehash of the same tired comments about early man's bizarre habit of creating half animal, half human effigies. If you are going to say something is unusual, there needs to be at least some indepth attempt to do more than dismiss as just like all the other half-human, half-animal images that exist in other places and times. Why aren't their more images of this type? Is it from the same period as the other drawings? No answers, just video tape. In short the cave seemed to ask many questions that the videographer did not. There is some great HD footage but at times the lighting could be better, the camera moves too fast and the experts tended to go on about things I didn't care much about.
159514188X|1.0|I pretty much agree with what the other negative reviewers have said so far. The book is highly engaging, a real page-turner, and easy to finish in just a few hours; but it's a wasted concept and leaves you so disappointed. Except for one or maybe two exceptionally horrible individuals, the people who \\"caused\\" Hannah's suicide are just regular high schoolers doing normal (if selfish and dumb) high school things. Hannah constantly complains about situations where no one helped her, where it is blatantly obvious that she did even less to help herself. Her narration is snarky and just as mean-spirited as any of the people she's laying so much blame on (not to mention, it sounds far more like, ahem, a novel than someone speaking off-the-cuff into a recorder, what with all the description and imagery). This is interspersed with the other main character, Clay, reacting to her words, and he always feels utterly sorry for her and agrees that the other kids are awful and deserve nothing but the worst, which I felt was unrealistic. I also agree with the reviewers who were angry that towards the end, she gave up completely and began deliberately making her life worse, yet continued to blame others. The entire book felt like a very heavy-handed message that you should never say or do anything to anyone that is anything less than saintly, because you never know what might push them over the edge; talk about an unrealistic moral. Did Hannah (or Jay Asher) ever consider that some of these \\"bad\\" kids probably had things going on in their own lives that SHE had no idea about? The topic is one that needs to be addressed, and the format is truly unique, but this story is wasted on a completely unsympathetic \\"heroine\\".
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I had every intention of purchasing a Star Wards blu-ray combo when it came out...after reading what George has done to the movies YET AGAIN, I've decided against it.  I've already got the 'enhanced' versions on DVD and they suck...now the've made them worse?<br /><br />No thanks...keep it...I'll just live with my childhood memories and the originals I have on VHS and DVD.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|As a die-hard Star Wars fan I say ENOUGH!  Do NOT buy this crap!  If he had included the original unaltered versions with this set, I would have bought not one but two copies of this but unfortunately we are not allowed that choice by Mr. Lucas.    So speak with your wallets and PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS!  Maybe Mr. Lucas will finally wake up and give us fans what we've been asking for all these years!
1612130283|5.0|Amazingly addicting story no matter what characters are used!! I will forever love this story about a successful-devilishly handsome but broken man finding love. I love you Fifty!!
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|I looked for one of these apps for so long, when I found this I thought it would be as unreliable as the rest. I was wrong. This is the simplest app that can do a very complicated thing. Use it.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Enough said. Update special effects if you want, but don't put things walking in front of the characters as they walk around town or change how scenes unfolded.    Yes, this is Lucas's to do with as he pleases, but it has also become ours.  Why no keep our vision in these discs and also put in the George's blurry visioned stuff too, then we can pic and choose.  Really, how much would it cost to add the originals all cleaned up to this release?
B004SB60OC|5.0|If all you have listened to is \\"Jar of Hearts\\" you are in for a treat.  This album reminded me of KT Tungstall a little.  Very good effort, the type of album you would listen to in a cafe or thirtysomething bar.  Not a bad cut on the album.
B004GYY714|5.0|Very intuitive and function. The best designed application that I have downloaded in the last 2 years. Developers well done.
1603580557|5.0|Donella Meadows is a genius. Rather, she was a genius; she passed away before this little gem of a book was published. I didn't know her or her work personally, so it is probably more conservative to only comment on this one little book --- which I thought was brilliant.<br /><br />Meadows delivers exactly what she promised: a primer on systems thinking. She digs deep enough and provides wide enough coverage to provide a strong grounding in the topic with a style that should be understandable for most readers. Where it is important, Meadows provides an adequate treatment of the nuts and bolts in a non-technical and enjoyable to read narration.<br /><br />Although hardcore systems modelers and programmers might find this primer simplistic, I found the simple explanations, integrated delivery, and concise package beautiful. I've read through some of the highly technical volumes about systems dynamics models, but I've not come across a book on the topic that packs more pound-for-pound punch than Thinking in Systems. My copy is riddled with marginal notes throughout, because Donella Meadows really made me think. No, she really made me understand. If you have even a passing interest in systems dynamics, this is a good place to start.
B004T5R2HQ|5.0|I have downloaded about 5 different scan apps and this one was the first to work well enough for me to purchase the full app. easy to use, took a bit for me to learn the buttons. easily share files as PDFs by email, Dropbox, etc. thank you for a good product! HTC incredible.
B0019Y67V2|5.0|I am so happy to have this on vinyl.  I remember when she came out with \\"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\\" and the video played endlessly on MTV (when it was good!).  This is definitely an album you want to have in your collection if you loved the 80's.  I would put this up there with other classics like \\"Thriller\\", \\"Private Dancer\\", \\"Born In the USA\\", \\"Purple Rain\\", and \\"Can't Slow Down\\" as great eighties albums.

B002L2GK0O|5.0|In the long history of instructional books I've read on everything from Calculus to Haynes Manuals (for my old Firebird), this is unquestionably the most complete.<br /><br />FOR BEGINNERS: The first ten pages give you a birds-eye view of what it takes to brew beer, bottle it and drink it.  You'll find that you need to actually walk through the process once and make your first beer before you can really start to understand how all your actions effect the final product.  The author understands this and doesn't make an effort to force detailed facts right away.  He will ease you into understanding why hops, yeast, barley and everything else is so important to your beer<br /><br />FOR INTERMEDIATES: The learning never ends!  For example, I'm currently working on growing my own hops and have constantly referenced the book to pick which varieties I want to grow.  Every single time I bottle, I reference an included nomograph that helps me determine how much sugar, honey, molasses I should prime with to get the desired level of carbonation.  Someday, when I'm ready to take brewing to a larger scale, the author includes instructions on how to build a lauter tun (right down to welding metallurgy and how it interacts with consumables)<br /><br />But most importantly, the author's writing style is fun and motivating.  He makes you WANT to read and learn more.  Just like when you start playing a musical instrument, the hardest part is keeping up the motivation until you're comfortable with the skill.  If you have any interest at all in brewing, BUY THIS BOOK!  Oh, and get it BEFORE you go and buy all your equipment... I wish I had :-\  Not all brewing equipment is created equal<br /><br />By the way: he's up to the THIRD edition now.  He's improved on topics like brewing sugars other than maltose, beer clarity and beer haze, beer color and estimation, and acid calculations.  It's definitely worth buying if you enjoyed any of his previous versions
B001EC3JME|5.0|I regularly carry around a narrow-diameter 2xAA LED flashlight (the [[ASIN:B003GXF9OA Streamlight 88033 Protac Tactical Flashlight]] or [[ASIN:B0041NE8TG Fenix E21 Flashlight]]), of which I have several of the same models.  I like to keep it on me, and the Nite Ize LHS-03 holster works much better than the stationary one that came with.  I particularly like the pivoting clip, which allows me hands-free use in numerous directions.  My last one survived 3 years of daily abuse, with only minor wear around the edges, before I had to replace it.  Since it's open back, it's easy to activate the tail-cap switch on my light.  Since my light has a uniform diameter, I can easily remove and replace my light, and it stays secure whenever I'm running around.  It's not ideal for every shape light, but it has worked well for my Streamlight, Fenix, Mini-Mag, two of my small Eveready C-cell lights (it's a snug fit, but works), and several cheap-o AA & CR123A Cree lights from Hong Kong - really, any flashlight with a long narrow body (between 0.75\\" ~ 1.5\\" diameter).  I'm very glad to have this Nite Ize flashlight holster!
B0059IVVZ6|5.0|Beirut's The Rip Tide is a wonderful album. The songs flow nicely, the lyrics are accompanied by wonderful melodies. Some may complain about the length of the album relative to Beirut's previous albums, but it seems they were focused on releasing and album full of equally great songs, there are no fillers here.     As for the vinyl packaging, it is the best I've seen all year. It is simple, yet fantastic. The record's outer sleeve is thick and sturdy, it is reminiscent of my old, high-fidelity classical records. It is also bound in cloth, adding to the quality of the sleeve. The inner sleeve is a thick, and of high quality plastic. This is one of the few records I opened and put directly on my turntable without having to thoroughly clean. A few specks of dust here and there, but I'm not complaining.    The physical and musical quality of this release is magnificent. One of the better albums of the year, and one of the highest quality packaging I've seen in a while.
B003J27WFW|5.0|I'm not one of RUSH's rabid fans--I have a few albums and honestly more than a few songs are a bit too heady. BUT, this is an excellent documentary; thorough without being tedious and at the end of the day, I liked them more as they seemed to be downright good dudes...and even a casual fan can't deny their musical chops. Top tier, expert musicianship. If you like rock and film, this a tasty surprise. Footnote: some of the home movie footage was unbelievable--like they KNEW there would be a documentary 30+ years down the road.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|A truly well explained documentary about the manufactured collpase of the American (and therefore the effects globally) economy.  The outstanding presentation, and the unease, nervousness, extreme perspiration and downright flumoxed images of those in the film whose  knowingly guilty parts in this collapse is shown, is a wonder to behold.  The arrogance of a couple of the interviewees is breathtaking.    As for those who, surprise surprise, were \\"unavailable\\" to be interviewed - it is extremely telling.  It is a psychoanalyst's delight to watch the body language, false humourous quips, and failed attempts at deflection of the truth performed by these guilty individuals, whether they are interviews specifically for the film, or are from past news bulletins.    But the more shocking realisation, is that all the economic collapses of the past, including the great depression of the 30s, were all artificially manufactured.  Did not Mr Bernanke admit as such just recently, with a pitiful apology?    There is no profit in global peace, and there is certainly no profit in a global market that is universally and consistently steady.  Enough said.    Wholly and completely recommended viewing.
1565016491|5.0|Of all the screen adaptations of Pride and Prejudice, this 1996 adaptation is my favorite. It is not only beautifully-filmed, but the casting is excellent, and it stays very faithful to the novel. The other two adaptations which I like are the 1981 adaptation starring Elizabeth Garvie as Eliza Bennet and the austerely handsome David Rintoul as Mr. Darcy. Unfortunately, because of its age, the production qualities are rather weak and the entire production looks washed out on-screen. Despite this, the 1981 version is well-cast and is the most faithful adaptation of Austen's novel. The most recent adaptation, the film version starring Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet and Matthew McFadyen as Mr. Darcy has a haunting score and is lushly filmed, and quite the most romantic of all three adaptations. The chemistry between Darcy and Elizabeth is palpable indeed! Yet, because of the time constraints (it only runs to about 2 hours), so much in the novel is left out, and many liberties are taken. Despite that, I loved it.<br /><br />Back to this 1996 adaptation - I have watched this BBC adaptation of Pride & Prejudice more than a dozen times, and I still love it! It never fails to transport me into Austen's world, & makes me yearn to remain there for as long as I can. My fantasies notwithstanding, I must say that the cast of this adaptation do an excellent job. The roles are matched perfectly to the actors & actresses, and the two leads are PERFECT!I think these are the defining roles for Jennifer Ehle (Elizabeth Bennet) & Colin Firth (Mr. Darcy). The Pemberley portrayed in this adaptation is my favorite. Julia Sawalha (who went on to play the lead actress in Lark Rise to Candleford) is simply audacious in the role of the wanton and vulgar Lydia Bennet! The ending of this adaptation is just perfect:)

B005IKZ60G|5.0|For the hardcore Guetta fans out there, this album seems to offer a little bit of everything for everyone.  Disc 1 includes the poppy collaborations we're familiar with over the span of the last few albums but disc 2 offers an awesome set assisted by Afrojack for a energetic music riot.  If I had one gripe it might be the song \\"Repeat\\" with Jessie J (but this could be because I don't entirely like her music to begin with) but Jennifer Hudson's vocals on \\"Night of Your Life\\" are fantastic.  Dev also gets in on the action with Timbaland, Justin Timberlake and Afrojack to produce a fun, Dev-typical song.  If you like David Guetta already, you need this album.  If you're just starting to like electronic music with hip-hop influences, you'll probably benefit from getting this album.  Its not Tiesto or Armin Van Buren by any stretch of the imagination, but it also doesn't disappoint.
B004Y5AV4M|5.0|No one writes Regencies like Georgette Heyer.  I don't even read any other romances but hers are some of the best writing, with the most likeable characters that I've ever come across.  Like Rex Stout was in mysteries, or Robert Heinlein was in science fiction, she is the best at what she does.

B0058UXHHK|4.0|Rose Gardner has visions of things that would be considered useless, she can't control them they just happen in the presence of the person who will be affected. But, this time she sees a vision of herself murdered on her mother's sofa.<br />Rose decides that she needs to take life into her own hands, she finally stands up to her mother who is ruthless and controls everything about Rose's life. Rose decides to make a wish list or bucket list of sorts with things that she would love to accomplish before she dies, twenty eight and a half wishes.  You can't imagine the things that she puts on her list; this girl has not lived at all.<br />I loved Rose, yes she was kind of naïve and had no clue about the simplest things but that was part of what endeared me to her. She has lived such a rough life and endured so much. When she finally finds her voice and decides that she will stop being a doormat for everyone she finds herself as the prime suspect in her mother's murder.<br />The story is nonstop action from here as Rose unravels hidden secrets of her past, tries to live each moment of her life as her last, and figure out who really murdered her mother.<br />The writing was engaging; the plot had a few twists that I wasn't expecting although there were others that I figured out early on. This book was definitely a page turner as I wanted to know what would happen next. I loved the story and it had everything that I could want in a book. A strong main character, mystery, and romance.<br />This is definitely a book you should check out.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I started this book last night. I just finished it less than 24 hours later. Yes, it IS that good.
B001LF347E|4.0|I like this show.  Yes it's cheesy, yes some of the special effects are...well..bad, yes it is completely \\"historically\\" inaccurate.  If you're a hard core Arthurian scholar you are unlikely to enjoy the show - to say it takes liberties with the legends is putting it mildly.  This is kind of \\"Merlin and co. are all teenagers together\\" and the show's creators don't seem to be concerned with being overly \\"high brow.\\"      This is clearly a First Season.  Meaning, the actors become more comfortable with their characters, scripts, and sets.  Some of the episodes are a bit rough and rocky (some are downright silly) but overall its good.        I find this show to be entertaining, if a bit fluffy (tho it does have its moments of depth), and the main cast (especially Collin Morgan and Bradley James)fun to watch.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|OK, George. I put up with your CGI Jabba, Greedo shooting first and the ghost of Hayden Christensen even though I didn't like them. I honestly didn't mind the cosmetic changes like adding bits and pieces to certain scenes and cleaned up special effects like light sabers and whatnot. But adding DIALOGUE?! Puuuuuhhhhleeeaaaasse. I was going to for sure buy this set but decided against it after today's fiasco.
0553801473|5.0|Enjoyed the book, however, now I have to wait for the next one. Seemed to fly by while I was reading it. Hurry up George!!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|What is it with Lucas making Vader yell \\"Nooo!\\" I laughed so hard in revenge of the Sith when he did it. Which makes me mad because I was really liking that movie up to that point. It sounds so very awkward and silly.    Adding a \\"Nooo!\\" to Return of the Jedi is stupid too. It's a comical voice and so very (VERY) out of character for Darth. Seriously, when things get really bad he yells \\"no\\" like a whiny school girl? Come on. Dumb, dumb, dumb. Just makes me sad that scenes that could've been (and in this case were) serious and emotional are now a big joke.    Maybe you disagree...but can we surely all agree that Lucas should NOT be messing with arguably the most pinnacle scene in the series? Or maybe he's just doing it to get people talking. I guess that worked, but people are also not buying...not me at least.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Between \\"Jedi Rocks\\", the \\"Noooooooo\\", Greedo shooting first, Ewoks blinking - I just can't take it any more.  I had pre-ordered this in May when it was first announced but cancelled when I heard about all of the additional changes that are going to be on the blu-ray.  It was bad enough that it was going to be the \\"Special Edition\\" but now there are EVEN MORE CHANGES???!!!?!?!?<br /><br />To date I have purchased 4-6 on vhs, 4-6 THX remaster VHS, DVD special edition 4-6, DVD 1-3, DVD 4-6 original cut.  Enough is Enough Already.<br /><br />George Lucas stop messing with these movies!!!  They started out great but are just getting worse and worse.<br /><br />I will not pay $90 to get kicked in the teeth anymore.
0345529057|5.0|I don't quite understand how the price is so low for this item.  Other than the unnecessary HBO branding, I have nothing negative to say about this product.  The books are amazing and for this price I recommend that everyone buy the set.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I don't consider myself the biggest fan of Star Wars ever, but I do enjoy watching the movies and going to that galaxy far, far away. I didn't have a problem with most of the se changes (though putting the younger version of Anakin at the end of rotj was bad), and I am certainly no Star Wars purist (don't care who shot first), but messing with the most climactic and dramatic scene of the series is absolutely and unconditionally a deal breaker. I canceled my pre-order immediately after seeing the new version of the scene, and I will not bother to buy the series on blu ray unless this travesty is rectified.  Update the graphics, add deleted scenes, fix mistakes...but don't mess with the moments that make the series.
B003YV64OI|5.0|This cpu does the trick if you are a gamer like me,but you must pair it with a good video card to get the full benefit of this cpu.It even play's my wii emulator smoothly.A great buy for you gamers out there.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved THE HUNGER GAMES, and feared that CATCHING FIRE might be a disappointment, by comparison.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that I liked it just as much.  The reader gradually learns more about this disturbing, dystopian world and the people in it, always from the point of view of the narrator.  It would be a mistake to stop with the first book.  Only after reading all three does the story reach a satisfying conclusion.
B001R4BTSU|5.0|This is a great sounding vinyl of a very nice album.  Melody Gardot has a wonderful voice and does these songs with feeling.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|This has become one of my most important apps. I used to think 7 launcher screens were not enough; now 3 are too many!  I love that when you install a new app, it pops up to ask how to file it.
0060920432|4.0|A fairly enjoyable book. I had heard great things about this book before I bought it and so far I'm not disappointed with the purchase. At the moment, unfortunately, I'm not done with the book, but I do not expect my experience to be any less than what it has already been.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I'll make this review short and concise. I was okay with him changing some special effects shots and making Yoda look digital. But, the Darth Vader noooooooooooo, completely ruined it for me. It took a very emotional and exciting climax and made it corny. If you're buying it you'll never look at that scene in a good way again.
B001IYD482|2.0|Love this movie loved the cool break away package however I rate this a 2 because the digital copy that came with the movie expired 2 years ago. I contacted universal and even they would not give me a code that would let me use digital copy. Feel like I didn't get what I paid for.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Thank you to my sister for recommending this book to me. I don't think I've ever read through a book so quickly, much less a series. The positive reviews here sum it up pretty well- a true 'page-turner', suspensful, exhausting, creative, a true attachment for the characters, etc, etc.
B002ZG994U|5.0|i totally doubted this movie when it first came out, but boy was i wrong... it is action from start to end...BUT i have never seen the t.v series so i have no idea how it would compare i just know that this movie is awesome...but i am disappointed that there will not be a part 2 due to sales :(
B00290FWYS|5.0|Cafe del Mar compilations are always excellent and showcase music and Artists you would otherwise not know about.<br />I have gone on to buy other records by artists that I found on Cafe del Mar collections.
B004PLWGVG|5.0|Ok well I'm not going to write a book here to describe how much I love this album. I was looking up new music on Amazon and FATM came up in my suggestions. I decided to sample some of the music and I was amazed. I became an instant fan to the point of mild obsession. Their music is so pure and spiritual. She is one of those rare/special artists that come up once every few decades. You'll find everything from up tempo songs like Kiss With a Fist to the beautiful sadness of Between Two Lungs.... I dont know what else to say but wow!

B003ZSJ212|1.0|Longtime Star Wars fan. Saw the first one in 1977 at 4 years old. I have loved Star Wars to a fault ever since. I was looking forward to buying this set. But with the news of the changes I have had enough. This is gone too far.
0875428940|3.0|At first I would have rated this deck 5 stars, but as the months went by I started distancing myself more and more from this deck. I tend to agree with the others - the deck is too \\"cheery\\" and \\"happy\\". I liked the images in the beginning and thought reviewers were crazy to think ill of this deck, but now I'm starting to see and feel what they did. Overall - it's an OK deck. I will probably use it again sometimes in the future, but for now I just put it away.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|This is a happy fun movie to watch, it is great to have \\"clean\\" movies that kids can watch and enjoy.
B004T5K3OK|5.0|Like everyone else, very impressed. Had been using the free one for a while...and the sale price for full was too good to pass up. Now I do have a question in regards to \\"Batch Mode\\".  I read the PDF manual in the developers site and it says once you take the first picture a box (looks like 3 boxes/pages stacked) will appear. You hit that and then take the next picture and it will process behind.  Well I don't get the \\"batch\\" option on my screen?<br /><br />Basically, it doesn't look like I have batch mode on my version...which is the latest one. Is there something I'm missing? Right now the only way to get multiple pages (batch) is take a pic, crop/edit, then process and save. Then repeat the process.  When I hit save to Dropbox only the first page is there, not any of the other ones?<br /><br />Once I learn the tricks to get this to work properly in batch it will be awesome!<br /><br />NOTE: I just realized the discounted version is one from November 2010 while the latest version is August 23, 2011.  Not very cool Amazon.  And while someone said you could use the Market free version with the Amazon licence, no you cannot.<br /><br />Final Note: By deleting both app and key then reinstalling app from market THEN key from Amazon got it to work with batch option.
1612130283|5.0|When I first heard this story was actually being published I couldn't wait to pre-order my copy. Yes the online version was good but this was even better because you didn't have to try to leave the Twilight(C) characters behind. I got lost in the story and couldn't put it down no matter how hard I tried.<br /><br />For those who think this story needs to keep the Twilight(C) feel, forget it.<br />This is not Stephanie Meyers' story. Fifty Shades of Grey is E. L. James' story of two people who meet under not so unusual circumstances and develop a relationship that doesn't necessarily conform to everyone's definition of normal. Christian finds the one person who can make him whole and Anastasia discovers something about herself that she never thought in her wildest dreams could exist.<br /><br />I enjoyed it the first time I read it online. I've pre-ordered the next installment and can't wait for it to arrive.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|The new Blu-Ray release.  More unnecessary editing.  Changing the final climactic scene.  Sometimes silence is golden.  Some things were bad...  I let them go and bought the DVDs with the \\"new\\" scenes.  Enough is enough George Lucas.  I can only hope that Katie will have the decency to actually release the set that people have asked for.  The ORIGINAL.    FYI, anyone considering buying this you get newly editted Blu-Rays that have change some items but not all.  Comic-con caught a couple of oppsies from the team.  So I'm sure there will be more.  Buyer beware.
0143119788|5.0|\\"Tinker, Tailor...\\", the first of three novels in the magnificent Karla trilogy,  is by far the best spy novel I have ever read, with the possible exception of it's sucessor in the trilogy, \\"The Honourable Schoolboy\\". George Smiley is the unlikely hero of this many layered tale of betrayal during the cold war,and unlike James Bond, et al, Smiley is a fussy middle aged beaureaucrat who would be at home in any large governmental agency - he simply happens to be a spy, and a very good spy indeed. His particular strength is the ability to notice the out of character action of a friend, the seeming contradictions of character that most would dismiss as inconsequential, the memory of a conversation from long ago, nuance is Smiley's strong suit. As such, this is not your usual American CIA spy thriller.<br /><br />The book describes the hunt for a \\"mole\\" inside Britain's Secret Intelligence Service (SIS)and in particular within the uppermost echelons of the Service, called \\"The Circus\\". The model for the traitor is the memorable Kim Philby, a mole highly placed in SIS. Anyone who is familiar with the chaos caused in American intelligence circles by Igor Nosenko, a defector (?) who asserted that a Soviet mole was operating in the highest levels of the CIA, will appreciate the wheels within wheels mechanations used to try to root him out (was there ever a mole?...was Nosenko a defector?...still open questions).<br /><br />The second novel in the trilogy, [[ASIN:0143119737 The Honourable Schoolboy: A Novel]], is as good or better than \\"Tinker, Tailor...\\". The depth of character here and the intricate plotting make these a great choice for long winter weekends before the fire. Finally, the third in the trilogy, [[ASIN:B004XFYWR0 Smiley's People: A Novel]], will wrap up loose threads though it never rises to the level of the first two novels.<br /><br />There will be a movie adaptation of \\"Tinker, Tailor...\\" in November of 2011, and I urge anyone interested to read the trilogy BEFORE you see the movie, which will by necessity sharply condense and probably bare all of the book's \\"aha moments\\". I saw the multi-episode 5 hour BBC Production years ago, and was intrigued enough to read the entire trilogy. Alec Guiness will be forever in my mind, the one and only George Smiley.<br /><br />By far the most literary of the spy genre, although Robert Littel comes very close (see [[ASIN:B000H2MAB8 The Company]]).

B004CRR9G0|4.0|It's not really the fault of the Blu-ray but I thought the quality of the video for this disk was not that great. I think the original animation for Nausicaa is so old that they had to upscale the video in order to get it to 1080p quality video. Still prettier than DVD though.
0061914177|5.0|I read this book in less than two days! (Listened to it through Audible.com) I've read hundreds of books, but never this quick and enthusiastically. This book is about dismissing the typically trite conversations about your \\"work-life balance\\" and tuning into your REAL PASSION. For those fortunate enough to identify their work and passions in the same breathe, READ THIS BOOK. However, if your work fails to get you truly excited and limits your ability to utilize your best strengths in an open and receptive environment, READ THIS BOOK.    Crushing it is all about being yourself while identifying and displaying your real image. Only when you're living your passion can you be truly transparent!

B005COO1X6|4.0|Driving in the family 2011 Ford Expedition, wife Carla riding shotgun and kids Rachel, 6, and Blake, 4, fidgeting in the back, Johnny Lussier flips his blinker and veers left onto the ramp to the abandoned Mile 81 rest area off I-95 near Portland, Maine.<br /><br />A pick-up pulling a horse trailer is parked in the breakdown lane. Traffic cones had been neatly placed behind the trailer and Johnny wondered if the driver needed help. Bad mistake. Really stupid. It would prove to be the \\"worst -and last--decision of his life.\\"<br /><br />My own bad decision, not the last of my life for sure, was to download \\"Mile 81\\" on my Kindle and start reading at 7:50 Thursday morning when I should have been heading out the door to work. Bad mistake. Stupid, really. King's Kindle Short grabbed me by the collar and wouldn't let go until I got to the end. I pulled into work at 10:15.<br /><br />What is it about King's style that grabs and won't let go? The story he tells in \\"Mile 81,\\" of cars and their passengers pulling into the abandoned rest stop 81 and confronting the dangers and peril lurking there, doesn't offer much in the way of plausibility. It's a mile or more from any sort of reality. But none of that seems to matter.<br /><br />Maybe it's the pacing. One car after another with pulls into the rest area. We get only enough information and back story to make the occupants real and worth caring about. Then wham, another victim gets slurped up.<br /><br />Maybe it the atmospherics. Particularly memorable is the sound that follows the mayhem, \\"a pouck sound like a tennis ball being smartly struck by a racquet.\\" Or the continual \\"tick. . . tick . . . tick\\" made the emergency flasher of an abandoned Prius.<br /><br />Maybe it's the details. A wedding ring lying mysteriously beside the door of a rusted out, mud covered station wagon with no plates. A cell phone lying on the ground with a single drop of blood on the touch screen.<br /><br />Or perhaps it's the characters, many of whom as in many other King stories are kids. Smart-talking kids with innocence and intuitive intelligence who tend to be the survivors. King is particularly good at showing kids being kids and talking to each other the way kids do using words like \\"boogersnot,\\" \\"numbo\\" and \\"Holy Jeezum.\\"<br /><br />Whatever the reason, the fact seems to remain for all the holes and all the things improbable that fill King's stories generally and \\"Mile 81\\" in particular, there isn't anyone writing today with a better imagination and a better ability to pull you in and keep you turning pages until the very end. Even if it means showing up late for work.ng kids with innocence and intuitive intelligence who tend to be the survivors.

B005COO1X6|4.0|It was sometime not too long ago that Stephen King said that the short story was dying in literature (something to this extent). With Mile 81 he's not only revived it but given it a reason to go on. It's a well developed with well rounded characters  that seem as real as can be.  Like most King fans know, Stephen has one of the best imaginations that's ever existed in literature.  Some have dismissed this e-book because it's too akin to Christine  or because it's too \\"out\\" there.  Let me honest for just a quick second: nothing King has ever wrote is too out there, he stretches the boundaries of fiction to write and that's why he's so successful.  With Mile 81  we feel comfortable with his character development.  Even though it's considered a Kindle single he's able to say more than some authors can say in a full length novel.  It's the story of an abandoned rest area, the look into the abyss of King's twisted sense of reality.  People start disappearing into thin air and all that the police have to go on is two kids vivid recreation of these events that garner no proof other than cell phones without owners.   Mile 81  is classic Stephen King - it's messed up, scary and best of all just like the classics that made him famous.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Lucas has tinkered with the original trilogy one too many times. This is the last straw and I will not be purchasing this set. The latest changes are absolutely ridiculous. Lucas is so out of touch with the fans who have made him and his family rich. Give the people what they want George, give them the original trilogy in it's ORIGINAL form!
0060878770|5.0|I simply wanted to add to all these great book reviews, that the voice of Maggie Gylenhall is absolutely perfect for this audiobook, and that it makes it all the more enjoyable.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Enough with changing the movies already!!! Don't you know that great artists also need to know when to declare a piece complete! Imagine what David would have looked like if Michelangelo had continued sculpting it for the remainder of his life? Not a perfect comparison, but you get the idea.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I have never been a big fan of Lucas's changes to Star Wars over the years. This time though, he has altered the climax of the saga, inserting a moment which has become widely mocked (Vader's \\"NOOOOOO\\" from Revenge of the Sith) into the most emotional point of Return of the Jedi.<br /><br />And to think, Lucasfilm tried to slip the set onto the market without letting anyone know about the changes they made this time.<br /><br />I have been a fan of the series almost my whole life, and I have stuck with it through all the alterations so far. These changes, however, were the straw that broke the camel's back. I do not recommend this set at all.<br /><br />That is unless you desperately need a feature length documentary on some fans who cosplay as Stormtroopers.
B002HK9IDQ|4.0|Saw the original movie years ago and loved it.  Ordered the CD to enjoy it again and listen to all that wonderful music and the costumes and the settings.  It's still charming and delightful.  Highly recommend it for family entertainment.Amazon verified purchase.
B004UXUSIM|5.0|No spoilers -- and you don't want to know anything about the plot in advance!<br /><br />I thought this was an exceptional movie with great acting by the entire cast.  I thought Owen Wilson was terrific in the lead and I thought Woody Allen's script was wonderful.  When it comes out on DVD, I will definitely buy it.
B003ASLJO0|5.0|The grouchy lapsed Catholic (Clint Eastwood) is living his retirement, with his pet dog and his endless supply of beer, manicuring his lawn, doing odd jobs in his house and watching the world go by from his porch. The world is changing and he is not. An ethnic minority (in Korea) extended family are now his neighbours. He growls at them often, particularly when his lawn is touched by unwelcome encroachers. His pride though, apart from his stoic independence, both from his neighbours and his persistent young priest, is his car; a Gran Torino. Funny bits are when he exchanges badinage with his barber. For those who haven't seen the film, any descriptions that follow would give the plot away. Let's just say that it comes through an emotional crescendo to a stunning climax; arguably, the ultimate gesture to love. It's a great film, so great that it's now in my top ten!  Ian Hunter.

B000001TVD|5.0|Even though this represented their third studio album within only one year of existence,Funkadelic were all the way there for the birth of what I call \\"people music\\"-meaning funk that had a strong message and strong musical values. Their self titled debut and [[ASIN:B000001TVB Free Your Mind...And Your Ass Will Follow]] both set the state and made it clear that they intended to set about letting everyone know that \\"a funk band could play rock\\",which is something they'd not only state later but that bands such as Mothers Finest,Living Color and soloists such as Lenny Kravitz and Tricky would realize some years later. And the early 1970's was just the time to do it too because while plenty of the free spirited 60's creative ideal was still in mass consciousness,but there was a new kind of focus in the air. That mixture of ambition and freedom was what allowed for this,what is essentially another short album to be what it is.<br /><br />  For the first time since they became Funkadelic,George Clinton and his band are very clear on their concept. The music is still full of rock riffs and heavy grooving but it's very clearly defined. What gets me about the well known title song is how Eddie Hazel's guitar comes into a mixture of Hendrix's blues,Santana's beauty and..trumpet player Louie Armstrong's understatement. He doesn't play a whole lot of notes but shakes and quivers the ones he does play to bring out the mixed emotions of the melody. \\"Can You Get To That\\",\\"Hit It And Quit It\\",Back In Our Minds\\" and of course \\"You And Your Folks\\" are a somewhat different matter. All are fairly short,to the point funk numbers based with spicy reverbed guitar/piano interaction. Really shows you what a little bit of production can do for live instrumentation. In that spirit these songs celebrate the concepts of wanting to live together BECAUSE of our various differences rather than in spite of them. On the more funk/metal blast of \\"Super Stupid\\" there's a more direct lyrical assault on those who try to stop non conformity.<br /><br />  The album concludes with the instrumental \\"Wars Of Armageddon\\". Musically it's one of the most ambitious pieces Funkadelic had done to this point. Based in a strong abstractly performed afro-latin jazz-/funk type jam similar to what Miles Davis would soon do on his [[ASIN:B00004VWAF On the Corner]] album. Even though it's mixed with founds sounds such as that of people arguing and what sounds like an H Bomb blast at the end (the music continues for a few seconds before fade) the song,as well as the album showcases something about George Clinton's approach to music and production. In a manner similar to Sly Stone he was a master of controlled chaos. While the instrumentation was definitely of the flamboyant sort,his trust of the band members chops really bought out the best and most innovative ideas in them. True no one was ego free every minute for sure. But that has value too. This music is full of self assured power,wit and thoughtfulness. That was an ethic that would not only become the backbone for the as-yet-to-be-Christened P-Funk sound but of the general genre of funk to this point. In a few short years it would be Clinton's style of funk,as opposed to James Brown that would be the central point for it's future innovations.

0783116934|5.0|Stephen Rae's character carries the burden of the Soviet Union's inefficiencies as he is put in charge, as a forensic scientist, of a serial murder case. &#34;There are no serial killers in the Soviet Union!&#34; snarls the character from Joss Ackland, suitably intransigent in his Party apparatchik role. Donald Sutherland's character (as well as his acting) is a revelation. He understands the forensic scientist's burdens and frustrations as the body count increases. He becomes an ally, weaving his way through the machinations of the supervising committee to the investigation. The film conveys the crumbling urban physical reality of the Soviet Union, portrayed as provincial Rostov. The murderer `can't get it up' for his wife. &#34;Pathetic&#34; she says after (obviously) another failed attempt. Five years on, the scientist breaks down; never having had leave in that time. Perestroika erupts. Resources suddenly become available. He suggests a psychiatrist's intervention; more Soviet obstruction until on the last day before the suspect has to be released, if not charged, he is given his chance. It's a tour-de-force of a cameo role by Max von Sydow but does he succeed in unmasking the true killer? The script is precise. There is not one redundant scene. The acting of Rae and Sutherland is perfectly understated. It is based on a true story. It is a film to watch!  Ian Hunter.

B00479SVBU|5.0|I read most of the comments on this model, also engages in discussions and check the competition. There's a lot of helpful reviews that helps my buying decision. I like the cuteness and functionality of the item.     All functions are well admired and criticize but there's one that I don't think I ever encountered, that's about the aux post connector. While playing music is well and dandy, sticking it on the aux cig socket maybe a problem for some vehicle. I have problem adjusting the screen to face me. It is not Soundfly problem but the vehicle aux location. Since I use my aux power for other things, I bought an extension outlets that you place on your cup holder that have two aux sockets and two USB and little lights to indicate usage draw, very nice. Also I have problem adjusting the screen tilt because the usb for iPod and micro cable for navigation and smartphone is level with the screen to adjustment. But well again, it's the vehicle cup holders design. I saw one model that comes with a short flex goose neck that tower out and above any obstacles. I know, I didn't get it, it's the only thing I like about it and I wish included in this item.     This problem is not a deal breaker, honestly, I can't read the screen while driving anyway. It's hard to incorporate every individual taste list for this price. Having almost all the things you want in an item is great enough to say.. . \\"It's a Buy\\".  I bought another one for a gift.

0385342055|5.0|Honestly I have been reading the past couple Shopaholic books out of loyalty.  They are always quick and amusing reads, but I was getting more and more annoyed with Becky!  This book brought me back to the original book that I enjoyed so much!  I was laughing out loud with this one much more, and overall just much more interested in the story.  I felt Becky was not as selfish, as most of the book was about a very special event she was planning for Luke and also about their daughter Minnie who was a riot!  I find myself wondering if there will be another Shopaholic book now, when previously I had been hoping that each one was the last and the story was exhausted!  Thank you Sophie for making Becky fun for me again, and I remain a loyal reader of all of your books!  Can't wait for the next one!

B003ZSJ212|1.0|As I have bought more than enough versions of the Star Wars trilogy on VHS and DVD, I wasn't exactly going to rush out and buy the Blu-Ray versions. It's not worth spending 90 bucks for special features and updated visuals and sounds.    But then I started hearing about changes that would show up. And then I realized that this is Lucas we're talking about here. The OCD and arrogant director who can't leave well enough alone.    And my suspicions were justified.     If there was any chance that I may buy the Blu-Rays in the future, that door has now been shut. That door may not be as big as the \\"new and improved\\" Jabba palace door, but it's solid, it's strong, and it will remain closed... forever.    The really rancid icing on the cake was Lucas changing the most pivotal scene of the entire franchise. The scene which everything else was leading up to. Darth Vader's redemption. A scene which was perfect as is. Do we really need to know what Vader is thinking? Does it really need to expressed in any way? No. Or should I say, \\"Noooooooooooooooooo!\\"?    So, no thanks, Lucas, I'll pass, and I hope everyone else does, too.

And it doesn't say, \\"This is a major scale, memerize all the major scales.\\"  This book teaches you how to build the scale, then you understand why the pattern looks a certain way, and memerization becomes easy.  And it does this for all the concepts it covers.  This book teaches you the inherent system of the guitar and you will learn a good deal of musical theory as well.  Buy this book, it's absolutely worth it if your serious about wanting to not just learn the guitar, but understand the guitar.
1427208476|4.0|This audio book was delivered promptly and in excellent condition.  The story is based on a sad and heart felt WWII experience that turned into a Hallmark moment.
B0031RAOW8|4.0|A very enjoyable movie to watch although it ends sadly. I'll have to look for Hachi's statue when I visit Japan again.
B004SIP7XK|2.0|I read some reviews and thought I would give this movie a shot.  I mean it starred Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris.  The story line was actually pretty intriguing.  But I just got tired of hearing the eff word in every other line.  I guess the one positive point of this movies was giving me gratitude that I don't move in the same circles as the people being portrayed.  I'm sorry I wasted the $10.  But it could have been worse.  I could have wasted more.
B004K4IZ3G|1.0|This was a waste of money.  It wasn't anything like I thought it would be. Kind of dumb and very un-interesting.
0062060554|4.0|Fast read. Keeps you wondering what is going to happen. I liked the book and I am passing it on to friends and family.
B0054N73EY|3.0|I have had the chance to hear this record online before the release, but I waited, like in the old days.    Finally it's here... I'm not for the long-ass, track by track BS pundit reviews - hearing a song is worth more than a million words. And it is different for the individual listener(S)    Overall, it's a new chapter with the Pepps, it's a slightly different sound, the guitars are cautious, the bass is in your face, there are many familiar Anthony vocal lines and maybe with this it could have been less predictable but he is part of the RHCP DNA without him there is no band       The drums are solid as you would expect from Dr. Smith...There are some new and interesting elements that we have not heard on other CHIlli records production - wise.    it is with this record that the Peppers will find what it is that they are looking for on the their next album, after having toured and lived together, but the big BUT is Rubin. They need a new produced from now on. Sorry Rick.    I Love the Peppers, I'd see them on the new tour to hear a new twist on the classics too. Let's just hope that no one gets back into the drug thing
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Just canceled my pre order. Vader now screams NO  NOOOOOOOOO when he toses the emporer down the shaft. LUCAS HAS LOST HIS MIND. I don't think I'm ever going to buy a new star wars product ever again.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|This release is a huge disappointment. I wish George Lucas would've left well enough alone and stopped tinkering with the original films, but the changes never end. I won't support any new \\"Star Wars\\" products until the original trilogy is properly restored and preserved as the important piece of cinematic history that it is.
B002RKSCA6|4.0|Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde is one of those books that, like many classics, everyone \\"knows\\" but no one's ever read. It's worth reading as it has influenced a great many stories since and has several worthwhile moments of its own, but only if you can put what you think you know about the story to the side. If you can put yourself in the place of the characters, the tale is mysterious and the fact that Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde are one and the same is a horrible revelation. The close of the book, in which the reader learns of Jekyll's view of the situation, is still remarkable, and the closing lines are terribly chilling.<br /><br />Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde doesn't match Stevenson's Treasure Island, but is a classic worthy of the title. It's also short and readily available at libraries or online, so you won't be wagering much in reading it for yourself.<br /><br />I listened to the audio version read by Ralph Cosham, a favorite of mine in the audio book field, and can certainly recommend Cosham's reading of the tale.
B0054N73EY|5.0|This album cooks,from beginning to end.John is gone and the RHCP do not miss a beat.This does not take away his greatness and contribution to the band.I DO NOT understand,for the life of me,what anyone that is giving this album a poor review,is hearing.I am shocked at the negative reviews.This is a highly creative turn for the band.I can't find a weakness on this album.It is fresh and they just keep maturing.In my opinion,this just picks up where Stadium Arcadium left off,and is a testament to their growth as musicians and writers.Great job Josh,especially the vocals on ''Did I Let You Know''.Overall,another sonic masterpiece!!
B0040QYROA|5.0|I first watched Metropolis about a year ago on a VHS version. I thought it was a very good movie, but it was certainly no masterpiece. The visual effects and backgrounds were striking and unique, but the picture was not particularly clear. The story was interesting but didn't make a lot of logical sense. The editing was all over the place in a way that made it difficult to follow what was going on. And most annoyingly the music had absolutely no relationship to what was happening on screen. Recently I attempted to rewatch this film in the version contained in a public domain boxed set. Unfortunately the picture quality was so bad that I gave up after only five minutes.<br /><br />Then I purchased Kino's Complete Metropolis, and it is almost like watching a whole new film. A reasonably good historical oddity of interest only to cineastes and sci-fi fans is now a masterpiece which can be fully appreciated by the general viewing public. Essentially four things were done to this edition: restoring nearly a half hour of lost footage, cleaning up the picture quality to pristine, re-editing the film for a more logical flow, and including the musical score which was originally composed for the theatrical premiere.<br /><br />SCORE: The orchestral score is amazing. Never in my life have I seen a silent film where the music matched the picture so well. It changes with the mood of the story, and it even matches rhythmic action. When the workers operate the machines by moving their bodies in jerky, German rhythm, the orchestra keeps a perfect beat.<br /><br />PICTURE: I cannot praise the picture quality of this DVD enough. It is obvious that some of the best digital restoration experts in the world worked on this project. You can see a tear run down a man's face. You can see a woman's nipples through her sheer dress. You can see automobiles and airplaines commuting around Upper Metropolis with perfect clarity. You can even read signs on buildings. Special effects from the 1920s stand up extremely well today. Flashes of electricity look every bit as good as Emperor Palpatine's lightning fingers in Return of the Jedi. The Isaac Asimov-esque robot, the massive flood, the large-scale destruction of the undercity, the masses of vehicles travelling outside, the huge interactive set-pieces - every visual element of this movie is absolutely stunning. Not a single thing looks cheesy or dated.<br /><br />RESTORED FOOTAGE AND RE-EDITING: 25 minutes of lost footage has been restored throughout the film. It's source is an extremely damaged film reel that has a different aspect ratio than the rest of the film. You can tell the restored footage from the rest of the movie because there is a small black bar at the top of the screen to compensate for the aspect ratio differences, but it is done so well that you don't notice it unless you are looking for it. Also the restored footage, since it is so damaged, appears slightly faded and has numerous vertical bars running down the screen. Although the restored footage is not nearly as clean and pretty as the rest of the film is, it is still much better than the uncleaned public domain versions of this movie I had seen previously. These added scenes and shots taken from highly damaged film still look better than your average unrestored public domain schlock.<br /><br />The cleaned up old footage was combined with the newly discovered footage, given new subtitles, and edited to be as close to the original as possible using a variety of sources. When a scene known to have originally existed is now lost the editors added title cards to explain what happens in the missing footage. I only remember this happening two times during the movie, and both times the explanation was not intrusive. Much of the restored footage consists of transitions, face shots, and various other short shots that help the editing to flow better. I'll give you an example. When young Fredersen is in his father's office, his father fires on ofhis employees. The man leaves the office sadly knowing that he will now have to work in the undercity. The two Fresersen's remain in the office and talk, and then the son leaves. In the unrestored version we then see the back of a man walking down a stairwell but cannot see his face. One may wonder who this man is, where he is going, and what is the relevence of this scene. In the restored version a face shot is inserted, and we can see that it is the man who has just been fired, dejectedly resigned to his fate and heading below. It's a little thing, but those little things add up. Those little additions contribute to plot understanding, character development, and narrative flow.<br /><br />There are also entire subplots that have been restored. The elder Fredersen orders a character known as the Thin Man to spy on his son. In unrestored versions we don't see the Thin Man again until much later when he is back in Fredersen's office. In this newly restored version we see all of the previously excised scenes of the Thin Man spying, and he is quite creepy sitting behind a newspaper and wearing heavy eyeliner. The Thin Man also commits a murder, something that happens to be important to the plot but we never got to see before. Another subplot that has been newly restored involves young Freder becoming aware of his destiny when a pastor reads him a passage from the book of Revelation.<br /><br />One of the biggest missing plot pieces of all has also been restored: why Rotwang the inventor makes his robot invention rebel against Joh Fredersen and incite complete chaos. It turns out that Rotwang is in love with Joh's dead wife. He believes that Joh has disrespected the memory of his wife. Also Rotwang is angry because he originally intended to create the robot in the likeness of the dead woman, but Joh ordered him to make it look like Maria. Now Rotwang is not just some mad scientist but actually has some motivation.<br /><br />There are a few things about the plot that still don't make perfect sense. Why would Fredersen fan the fires of discontent to start an uprising against himself? Why would the mob destroy the machines that keep their own neighborhood above water? Although the plot is much much clearer, there are a few things that don't make perfect sense. But these are no fault of the movie but can rather be attributed to the illogical state of human nature. Sure Metropolis has plot holes, but they are no where near as big as the paradoxes in modern sci-fi classics like the Matrix and the Terminator.<br /><br />I want to add one final thing about the actress who plays Maria (I don't have her name in front of me at the moment). She was an incredible actress. Yes her acting style was melodramatic (perhaps even vaudevillian), but it was necessary for this kind of film. She could communicate a character just through a facial expression and tell an entire story with her body language. You could tell just by one look whether she was playing Maria or the robot who looked like Maria. Had she been around a few decades later (at that age) she could have been a James Bond girl. There is one scene where Maria is running from Rotwang through the catecombs and she is frightened by seeing human skeletons in every corner. That scene is pure Indiana Jones. Great adventure stuff there.<br /><br />I've done enough talking and have no good way to close this review. GO SEE THIS MOVIE AS SOON AS YOU CAN.his employees.

B0034G4P8K|4.0|I received the message that the U. S. government is hiding knowledge about what is beyond Earth's atmosphere. But all governments hide information from the masses of their people. What intrigued me was when the Sentinel Prime character said to the Optimus Prime character that they used to be gods and now they were called machines. I can relate to that statement. I am a descendant of a people that were performing high sciences at one point in time and now we are beasts of burden. Try to talk to a typical African person about science and see what you get. At best they'll say, how does this help me pay my bills? At worse they'll look at you like you have 2 heads.
1400052181|5.0|I read non-fiction reluctantly but Rebecca Skloot's ability to tell an important story pulled me through the book easily and quickly. It's an important story that provokes more questions than it answers. But great books do that. I highly recommend you read about how HeLa cells changed the world as we know it.
B0017XD3OY|4.0|I Am Legend, directed by Frances Lawrence, is a good film when viewed as is, but it is a great film when you flip it 180 degrees. I Am Legend is about a virus that gets into the blood of human beings and infects almost everyone in the society. These new beings are portrayed as sick monstrous people. However, when you flip the film and see that the new beings are evolved you get the real purpose of the film. The beings can run faster than humans. They can leap far distances and climb. These beings can communicate without words and had a respect for other living beings. As the one scientist who is not infected drives around during the day, when the new beings stay inside, you can feel the peace of the place. After watching the film you are left with the question, do these beings need to be cured?

B000P0J0EW|5.0|We often discuss the lack of fairness of the United States justice system. We also discuss the rights of formerly incarcerated persons. The film Shawshank Redemption deals with something more important than either of the other issues. What the U. S. prison system does to the human beings involved with it. The savage way in which we punish people affects the guilty, the falsely accused, the prison guards, and prison officials. Shawshank Redemption brilliantly shows you what prisons do to people.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I've never written an Amazon review before but I feel compelled to warn others.  I've had this set pre-ordered for months, but the recent confirmation of further tinkering to these films paired with the lackluster special features package has pushed me to cancel.  I would gladly pay double this asking price for the original, unaltered trilogy.  These versions of the films are altered even further than the \\"special edition\\" versions that we saw released on DVD.  Most of the great vintage documentaries have been ignored in favor of fluff featurettes.  I hope the unaltered, restored films are released one day, but for now, I will not spend more money on this failed experiment.  I prefer that my child has the option of seeing these films as they were originally released.      It is one thing to release special editions while preserving the original films along side them, like so many other filmmakers have (Blade Runner, E.T., etc.).  The attempt to erase these important films from history is a travesty.
0061537934|5.0|My partner bought me this book on Audible Books and kept insisting I listen.  I procrastinated.  When I started it, I couldn't finish.  One of the best books I have ever read -- deep, fun, touching and every other good word that could be used.  Get it, read it, suck it all up.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|That's it, George. I'm out. I'm not buying another single Star Wars item until you release a HD version of the Original Unaltered Trilogy. You know, I don't care if you want to screw around with the movies and add \\"cute\\" little creatures and embarrassingly mediocre quality (a notch above PS3 cut scenes) CGI characters, I just want the option to watch the movies without that stuff. You know we want it, and you know you have it (not buying that crap about \\"destroying the negatives to make the SE\\"). What is the problem? Have we not given you enough billions of dollars? Guess what? I'll personally start the next billion dollar payday for you if you just do what you know deep in your heart is right.     Luckily for us, the admirers and supporters of your original vision, there are preservationists and faneditors out there preserving what you refuse to.      ADYWAN to have to tell you this, but you're HARMYing your chances of anyone caring about your future endeavors with these actions. You have turned one of if not THE the pivotal moment in the entire saga into a laughing stock. We don't need Vader to vocalize. There is more emotion behind that black mask in those 20 seconds than there is any other scene in the entire saga.     For the love of film, heed your own words:      \\"My name is George Lucas. I am a writer, director, and producer of motion pictures and Chairman of the Board of Lucasfilm Ltd., a multi-faceted entertainment corporation.    I am not here today as a writer-director, or as a producer, or as the chairman of a corporation. I've come as a citizen of what I believe to be a great society that is in need of a moral anchor to help define and protect its intellectual and cultural heritage. It is not being protected.    The destruction of our film heritage, which is the focus of concern today, is only the tip of the iceberg. American law does not protect our painters, sculptors, recording artists, authors, or filmmakers from having their lifework distorted, and their reputation ruined. If something is not done now to clearly state the moral rights of artists, current and future technologies will alter, mutilate, and destroy for future generations the subtle human truths and highest human feeling that talented individuals within our society have created.    A copyright is held in trust by its owner until it ultimately reverts to public domain. American works of art belong to the American public; they are part of our cultural history.    People who alter or destroy works of art and our cultural heritage for profit or as an exercise of power are barbarians, and if the laws of the United States continue to condone this behavior, history will surely classify us as a barbaric society. The preservation of our cultural heritage may not seem to be as politically sensitive an issue as \\"when life begins\\" or \\"when it should be appropriately terminated,\\" but it is important because it goes to the heart of what sets mankind apart. Creative expression is at the core of our humanness. Art is a distinctly human endeavor. We must have respect for it if we are to have any respect for the human race.     These current defacements are just the beginning. Today, engineers with their computers can add color to black-and-white movies, change the soundtrack, speed up the pace, and add or subtract material to the philosophical tastes of the copyright holder. Tomorrow, more advanced technology will be able to replace actors with \\"fresher faces,\\" or alter dialogue and change the movement of the actor's lips to match. It will soon be possible to create a new \\"original\\" negative with whatever changes or alterations the copyright holder of the moment desires. The copyright holders, so far, have not been completely diligent in preserving the original negatives of films they control. In order to reconstruct old negatives, many archivists have had to go to Eastern bloc countries where American films have been better preserved.    In the future it will become even easier for old negatives to become lost and be \\"replaced\\" by new altered negatives. This would be a great loss to our society. Our cultural history must not be allowed to be rewritten.    There is nothing to stop American films, records, books, and paintings from being sold to a foreign entity or egotistical gangsters and having them change our cultural heritage to suit their personal taste.    I accuse the companies and groups, who say that American law is sufficient, of misleading the Congress and the People for their own economic self-interest.    I accuse the corporations, who oppose the moral rights of the artist, of being dishonest and insensitive to American cultural heritage and of being interested only in their quarterly bottom line, and not in the long-term interest of the Nation.    The public's interest is ultimately dominant over all other interests. And the proof of that is that even a copyright law only permits the creators and their estate a limited amount of time to enjoy the economic fruits of that work.    There are those who say American law is sufficient. That's an outrage! It's not sufficient! If it were sufficient, why would I be here? Why would John Houston have been so studiously ignored when he protested the colorization of \\"The Maltese Falcon?\\" Why are films cut up and butchered?    Attention should be paid to this question of our soul, and not simply to accounting procedures. Attention should be paid to the interest of those who are yet unborn, who should be able to see this generation as it saw itself, and the past generation as it saw itself.    I hope you have the courage to lead America in acknowledging the importance of American art to the human race, and accord the proper protection for the creators of that art-as it is accorded them in much of the rest of the world communities.\\"
0553801473|4.0|I took away one star only because so many characters kept popping up and I had difficulty figuring out who they were and where they came from (I used the maps and the character glossary 10 times more than with the other books).<br /><br />That being said, I loved every page of the book. My only regret is that we might have to wait another five years for the sequel. My favorite characters are Tyrion and Jon Snow but I was aghast and left hanging about their futures.<br /><br />Terrific time spent reading this book.
B004T5K3OK|4.0|I've been using this for a while and disliked some of the restrictions the free one had so I decided to upgrade. Great tool for your phone! Creating pdf files is easy. Sharing them with others is a breeze and is done straight from the app. this would be great for scanning business cards, receipts, or even the occasional document that needs to be sent to someone in a rush. The hardest part is keeping your hand steady as you frame your shot. Definitely worth the price!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|We all took the changes in the first DVD's with a grain of salt, but there is no way I'm buy this Blu-Ray set now. It was bad enough they had to replace the Emperors hologram in empire and Anakin's in Jedi, but seriously another Vader NOOOO!, changing Ben's yell in ANH? Give me a freaking break Lucas. I wouldn't mind the Ewoks blinking, that wouldn't bother me, but the other two on top of the crap from the DVD's. I'm Done!
B0040JHLM2|5.0|This is the 11th version of shoe in this line, and I own the past 3 year-models.  (11,10,9).  It's a solid reliable shoe that forms the core of my running shoe collection.  In general, I know what I am buying with this shoe and I know what to expect as far as performance.  This shoe definately helps a good bit with pronation and will attempt to correct your foot back to the norm, but it doesn't rub you too hard like some other shoes would (a pair of asics come to mind).  The only drawback is that they wear out quickly.  Most shoes last to 500 miles and I find that the cushoning barely lasts to 400.  Granted I do a lot of hard running on consecutive days.    If you like these also consider the next line up - Trance.  It will cost you, but you wont be sorry.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|These latest scene changes are the final proof that George Lucas has lost his mind, however they are NOT the main reason why I just cancelled my blu-ray pre-order. I had been excitedly counting down the days until this release, but this time George/Lucasfilm has given the whole Star Wars community the middle finger by not correcting many of the problems (color) which plagued the 2004 release. This blu-ray has virtually all of the same issues as the DVD.  I'm talking about Vader's bubblegum pink lightsaber, the super high orange or purple explosions opposed to the more realistic white hot/yelow effects. These were especially noticable during the Battle of Yavin, Tantive IV shootout, and the carbon freezing chamber duel. They stuck out to the point to where they were almost distracting. After seeing the prequels, it's hard enough to still view Vader as that ultimate bad a** villian I feared in my childhood, but it's now near impossible to do it when he's chasing after Luke with a pink lightsaber.    Lucasfilm has been made well aware of these issues thru complaints made by ticked off fans since the DVD launched 7 years ago. Now in the last year of hyping up of this Blu Ray release, Lucasfilm has assured us Star Wars fans that our complaints had been heard and addressed in this release,  the Blu-Ray would NOT have the same color and audio problems as the dvd's, they went back to the original negatives and spent 3 years fixing these particular problems, they manually went thru frame by frame in the problem scenes fixing and making other color corrections to bring them close again to the original theatrical versions.     Heck Starwars.com displays a screenshot of Luke's fixed blue lightsaber on the Millenium Falcon in ANH, boasting about how they went back and fixed these problems. I have seen the Blu-Rays myself and I can confirm this is NOT the case!! Yes it is fixed for that particular frame and a few other frames, but the next shot of the same scene his lightsaber shifts back to green, just like in the screwed up dvd release, then goes to bright white, then back to a very pale blue color. Yes they fixed ONLY a small portion of that scene, left the rest of it untouched with the wrong color, while implying that the whole thing has been corrected. The lightsaber scenes in the other movies, Empire Strikes Back & Return of the Jedi, are practically UNTOUCHED WITH THE SAME color and timing problems that the DVD's have. It's like Lucasfilm is only willing to put in a half a** effort in anything they release anymore.... and why not?? If it says Star Wars on the box it's going to sell.     Now for the changed scenes:    A New Hope    - When R2-D2 hides in the shallow cave from the Sand People, there have been CGI rocks added in. The new rocks now cover up half of R2's body which makes him hidden better. However when he leaves a few seconds later, he just pulls forward and the rocks simply disappear!! Did they just forget to alter that scene too?    - Obi-Wan's introduction, he scares the Sand People away with a Krayt dragon call, has been redone again and now sounds like a jr. high kid making funny noises in Windows sound recorder. When I first heard it I thought no way, it's someone pulling a joke. It's sounds so bad and is so out of place, they made absolutely no effort to mix it in at all. You'll just have to hear it for yourselves... but sadly it's real. Unbelievable    - Greedo still shoots first. It is alot better than the DVD version.      Empire Strikes Back    - Wampa's arm in fixed. Looks good about time.      Return of the Jedi    - Jabba's Palace has a bigger door... ok?    - New CGI alien walking around in Jabba's palace as everyone sleeps. Poorly done and sticks out worse than a sore thumb... looks like Sebulba from Episode I?    - Ewok's now have CGI eyelids, blink, and sometimes make a clicking noise when they do. (maybe a tribute to Muppets/Fraggle Rock?)    - Darth Vader now screams \\"Noooooooooooo\\" as he picks up and throws the emperor, much like the way he does at the end of Episode III.... now twice!! This       ruins a great and one of my favorite scenes. It's bad. The voice doesn't even sound like Vader's and it's just lazily pasted over the rest of the audio.   Lucasfilm didn't make the effort to blend in at all..... what are they thinking????? If you really feel you need to add something like that, at least attempt a decent job.     This has just gotten laughingly ridiculous. There is no excuse this time for ignoring what the fans want and taking away more of the original magic the movies had back in the 70's and 80's. Besides the deleted scenes, this is not a quality release. I've cancelled my pre-order and I'm done with anything new to do with Star Wars. This includes the new upcoming 3d versions which will no doubt have even more stupid changes and conveniently opens the door for yet another Blu-Ray release. I have my unaltered copies on my bonus DVD and that's all I need.     I urge anyone who feels the same way to NOT fill the pockets of George Lucas anymore!! I don't understand how they think it's necessary tinker with new stupid voiceovers and Ewok eyes, but not fix the more obvious and distracting problems of this and the previous release. All the while Lucasfilm insinuated, just as recently as last week, that they had indeed corrected those problems..... THAT IS FALSE ADVERTISING!! They also claimed to have exhaustively sent this set thru 3 levels of quality control which is either another lie or Lucas has the most elite team of a** kissers ever assembled. I've defended the first two prequels, the Special Editions, and George Lucas himself over the years, but I'm done. For the first time in 25 years they will not be getting another dime of my money.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I am very angered by this whole thing about George Lucas putting all 6 films of the original trilogy and the prequel on Blu-Ray instead of regular DVD, with the deleted scenes (which I wanted to see of the deleted scenes anyway -- I already have all 6 films on regular DVD, original trilogy on THX (1997 version) as well as 2004 version of original trilogy with the original theater releases of 1977, 1980 and 1983 movies on DVD (the ORIGINAL WAY it was meant to be).      What really bugs me BIGTIME is that why Lucas wanted to bring them all out again on Blu-Ray and to make it more realistic than before. \\"If it ain't broke, don't fix\\"...that is the addage that should be used by Lucas on this. When I heard of the new changes and added audio and other tweeks to it, I was very livid, even though I don't have a Blu-Ray player and don't want one at this time because they are so expensive and there are very few movies on release as Blu-Ray anyway. If George Lucas had smarts, which he does, he should have produced the movies again on regular DVD and to make them available as a package for both DVD and blu-ray, so that people will have a choice to buy either version. But since it is on Blu-Ray, then with the added tweeks etc that he added in there and replaced, then being the actual STAR WARS PURIST as I AM, then it makes it all the more to NOT buy this release when it comes out on September 16 2011.      What George Lucas did, really destroys his original vision of the story and the saga as it goes on and continues today in books and novels. I have read all of the novels and books that lead after the original triology ends, right up to the current series \\"Fate of the Jedi\\" series -- with 2 more hardback books, one I am reading now \\"Ascension\\" and the other book \\"Apocalypse\\" coming out in April 2012...who knows if the Star Wars saga will continue after that.      Like I said before and will say again, \\"If it ain't broke, don't fix\\". Don't fix the original...it is set in American cinema history forever, and I think that Darth Vader himself will tell you \\"Nooooooo\\" only once, which that is in the original \\"Return of the Jedi\\" scene at the 2nd DeathStar. The added yell and cry is not in the original trilogy version and not in the 1997 and 2004 versions. Why did Lucas put that in there, I will never know. It defeats the purpose why we watch movies and escape to worlds that are not our own.      Please do not buy the Blu-Ray version of this on September 16 2011...if you are a pure Star Wars fan like I am, then save your money and use it for things that mean more than just to see mistakes being added to an original classic, and i really do mean ORIGINAL.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|These latest scene changes are the final proof that George Lucas has lost his mind, however they are NOT the main reason why I just cancelled my blu-ray pre-order. I had been excitedly counting down the days until this release, but this time George/Lucasfilm has given the whole Star Wars community the middle finger by not correcting many of the problems (color) which plagued the 2004 release. This blu-ray has virtually all of the same issues as the DVD.  I'm talking about Vader's bubblegum pink lightsaber, the super high orange or purple explosions opposed to the more realistic white hot/yelow effects. These were especially noticable during the Battle of Yavin, Tantive IV shootout, and the carbon freezing chamber duel. They stuck out to the point to where they were almost distracting. After seeing the prequels, it's hard enough to still view Vader as that ultimate bad a** villian I feared in my childhood, but it's now near impossible to do it when he's chasing after Luke with a pink lightsaber.    Lucasfilm has been made well aware of these issues thru complaints made by ticked off fans since the DVD launched 7 years ago. Now in the last year of hyping up of this Blu Ray release, Lucasfilm has assured us Star Wars fans that our complaints had been heard and addressed in this release,  the Blu-Ray would NOT have the same color and audio problems as the dvd's, they went back to the original negatives and spent 3 years fixing these particular problems, they manually went thru frame by frame in the problem scenes fixing and making other color corrections to bring them close again to the original theatrical versions.     Heck Starwars.com displays a screenshot of Luke's fixed blue lightsaber on the Millenium Falcon in ANH, boasting about how they went back and fixed these problems. I have seen the Blu-Rays myself and I can confirm this is NOT the case!! Yes it is fixed for that particular frame and a few other frames, but the next shot of the same scene his lightsaber shifts back to green, just like in the screwed up dvd release, then goes to bright white, then back to a very pale blue color. Yes they fixed ONLY a small portion of that scene, left the rest of it untouched with the wrong color, while implying that the whole thing has been corrected. The lightsaber scenes in the other movies, Empire Strikes Back & Return of the Jedi, are practically UNTOUCHED WITH THE SAME color and timing problems that the DVD's have. It's like Lucasfilm is only willing to put in a half a** effort in anything they release anymore.... and why not?? If it says Star Wars on the box it's going to sell.     Now for the changed scenes:    A New Hope    - When R2-D2 hides in the shallow cave from the Sand People, there have been CGI rocks added in. The new rocks now cover up half of R2's body which makes him hidden better. However when he leaves a few seconds later, he just pulls forward and the rocks simply disappear!! Did they just forget to alter that scene too?    - Obi-Wan's introduction, he scares the Sand People away with a Krayt dragon call, has been redone again and now sounds like a jr. high kid making funny noises in Windows sound recorder. When I first heard it I thought no way, it's someone pulling a joke. It's sounds so bad and is so out of place, they made absolutely no effort to mix it in at all. You'll just have to hear it for yourselves... but sadly it's real. Unbelievable    - Greedo still shoots first. It is alot better than the DVD version.      Empire Strikes Back    - Wampa's arm in fixed. Looks good about time.      Return of the Jedi    - Jabba's Palace has a bigger door... ok?    - New CGI alien walking around in Jabba's palace as everyone sleeps. Poorly done and sticks out worse than a sore thumb... looks like Sebulba from Episode I?    - Ewok's now have CGI eyelids, blink, and sometimes make a clicking noise when they do. (maybe a tribute to Muppets/Fraggle Rock?)    - Darth Vader now screams \\"Noooooooooooo\\" as he picks up and throws the emperor, much like the way he does at the end of Episode III.... now twice!! This       ruins a great and one of my favorite scenes. It's bad. The voice doesn't even sound like Vader's and it's just lazily pasted over the rest of the audio.   Lucasfilm didn't make the effort to blend in at all..... what are they thinking????? If you really feel you need to add something like that, at least attempt a decent job.     This has just gotten laughingly ridiculous. There is no excuse this time for ignoring what the fans want and taking away more of the original magic the movies had back in the 70's and 80's. Besides the deleted scenes, this is not a quality release. I've cancelled my pre-order and I'm done with anything new to do with Star Wars. This includes the new upcoming 3d versions which will no doubt have even more stupid changes and conveniently opens the door for yet another Blu-Ray release. I have my unaltered copies on my bonus DVD and that's all I need.     I urge anyone who feels the same way to NOT fill the pockets of George Lucas anymore!! I don't understand how they think it's necessary tinker with new stupid voiceovers and Ewok eyes, but not fix the more obvious and distracting problems of this and the previous release. All the while Lucasfilm insinuated, just as recently as last week, that they had indeed corrected those problems..... THAT IS FALSE ADVERTISING!! They also claimed to have exhaustively sent this set thru 3 levels of quality control which is either another lie or Lucas has the most elite team of a** kissers ever assembled. I've defended the first two prequels, the Special Editions, and George Lucas himself over the years, but I'm done. For the first time in 25 years they will not be getting another dime of my money.    ***UPDATE 9/9/11***    I've viewed the bonus content which the deleted scenes are no doubt the best of all the extra features. As for the Prequels, the previously released DVD deleted scenes are NOT included, so hangonto your old discs. The older movies include scenes that have been Star Wars folklore for years. Some are good and the quality is what you expect for deleted scenes cut over 30 years ago. However some of scenes I particularly had interest in, seem to be made from degraded alternate shots... since there are productions stills and video snippets that Lucasfilm released, over the years in different supplemental products, showing the same scenes taken from higher quality sources. On another note, the deleted ESB content shows the scenes leading up to and the aftermath of the wampa fight with rebel soldiers in Echo Base. The battle itself is completely omitted in this release, which is a shame since the battle scene was filmed and possibly finalized before it was cut from the final release. Luckily there are various stills of this scene still floating around and it was covered by Star Wars Insider years back. The rest of the content is very good and it's great finally seeing some of the other scenes... however after viewing I get the impression Lucasfilm is purposely holding back some of these materials for a future release.
B004EPYZZI|5.0|A little known movie that did not do very well at the box office, yet it is a heart warming (and true) story about the power and strength of the human spirit. I recommend this movie wholeheartedly.
B001LGH4FQ|5.0|I bought the Steelbook mainly as a collectors item. It is too hard to have passed up especially with Captain Rex  on the cover. I have the regular DVD version and choose to abuse that in viewing it continuously. The Clone Wars series is Amazing, well written, produced, and ultimately satisfies any Star Wars fans yearning to be  immersed in the Star Wars Universe.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I grew up watching the original versions and cringe at all the silly changes that have been made in the past 15 years. Now they are adding MORE?? I may rent or borrow to see how they look in 1080p but won't be buying until they remaster the originals.     Join me people. Let's see how fast we can send this release to the bargain bin.     I do think it was a good idea to put CGI Yoda in TPM but who watches the prequels anyway?
B003ZSJ212|1.0|When will George Lucas learn that we have had it with all these unnecessary alterations, and why does he not care about the fans! Its like he doesnt want us to buy them!
B003ZSJ212|4.0|I've been watching Star Wars movies for quite a while and am excited to finally see them in hi-def. I fail to see why people are being so unreasonable and grossly over emotional about the changes that have been made. For the most part they're not that big of deal and don't really add or subtract from my experience or enjoyment. Besides, the problem isn't actually the changes that have been made, it's really George Lucas' refusal to release the original versions. I wish that he would just release them. It's a win-win for him and the fanatics and then everyone can shut up and go back to enjoying it for what for it is. That issue aside, I'm hopeful that this will be the best looking version yet released, though I'm not a fan of the box art.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|extremely well written screenplay, beautifully shot, great acting. two thumbs up, a must see film. best film i've seen in a long time
030788743X|5.0|Awesome. I can't say anything about the plot that others have said before. So I'll just say that if you liked this, you'll also like Daniel Suarez's [[ASIN:B003L1ZXCU Daemon]] and [[ASIN:B003MAJNUS Freedom (TM)]] .
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Let me just sum up what other disappointed fans are saying here by quoting the immortal words of another George:    \\"And if all others accepted the lie which the Party imposed-if all records told the same tale-then the lie passed into history and became truth. 'Who controls the past' ran the Party slogan, 'controls the future: who controls the present controls the past\\" (Orwell, 1984, Chapter 3).    Pretty much a perfect summary of what Lucas is doing, isn't it?  My plan at this point is to track down the originals on DVD or VHS and forget about buying any new versions unless Lucas finally sees fit to do what he should have done in the first place and release the theatricals on high definition.    Darth Vader's not-so-great new scene in ROTJ is what did it for me.  That scene was one of my favorites.  It was so powerful before.  Now it's just corny.    Enough is enough!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Seriously? \\"Noooooo!\\"?    When I was a kid, even up until a few years ago, getting me anything Star Wars related would have brought me a little bit of joy. I think I'm done with this franchise.
B004EPYZQC|4.0|As understood, nice police officers had justice taken in their hands by stealing voult of not nice guys from a storage.<br /><br />Near a sci-fiction story with blood, murdering and questionable moral.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|With every Hunger Game Novel, the story becomes more intense and rich with emotion. Suzanne effectively places the reader in Katniss' shoes as she goes through the emotional roller-coaster of being the \\"Mockingjay\\" for the rebels in the fight against the Capitol all the while dealing with the trauma of her past, social complications, and intense confusion over what part she truly plays. To those wondering if they should continue/ finish this series, it IS worth your time! If you enjoyed the twists and turns of being in Katniss' shoes in the past, then you will hunger for more once you're through!!!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|The changes being done to this film is a crime against art. Why Lucas feels the need to soil his good films with bizarre alterations to rub his fan's noses in being reminded of his later terrible films, I will never know.     I'd rather just watch the good Star Wars movies on VHS.
B004DIPLQS|5.0|For decades and decades, Rubinstein has been the pianist of choice for Chopin, and such was the pre-eminence of the man that it is difficult, even now to disagree . My personal preference though, at least for  the two piano concerti, is for the grand dame of piano Martha Argerich. She has recorded these many times, and the two audio recordings that stand out are the 1996 DG recording of the first concerto with Abbado and the LSO (coupled with Liszt's concerto no 1), and the 1999 recording of both concertos 1 and 2 on EMI with Dutoit and the Montreal Symphony. These are seminal performances, and quite indispensable for any collector of Chopin's music.Then came Krystian Zimerman whose amazing DG recording made us hear the concerti with fresh ears and became for many the first preference for these two works, and justifiably so!       This celebratory concert for the 200th birthday of Chopin features the Warsaw Philharmonic led by Antoni Wit, and two superstar Russian pianists, Demidenko playing the first concerto in E minor and the even more illustrious Evgeny Kissin playing concert no. 2 in F minor. The Blu ray version is technically superb with excellent picture quality and a spacious true to life DTS audio recording.         Demidenko's  sensitive, almost poetic rendition of the E minor opus is most satisfying, he seeming to relish every phrase and nuance of this most  beautiful piano concerto. in his hands the first movement,allegro maestoso, impressed me deeply with a haunting tenderness in parts and a restrained passion in the faster passages, whilst the larghetto second evolved, trance-like into a languid and romantic reverie. Fantastic stuff. Antoni Wit  and the orchestra accompany deftly  with some delicious interweaving of the lyrical melody with the solo piano .          In the second concerto, it is very good to see and hear Kissin approaching his fortieth year, performing a work with which as   a child prodigy, he astounded the musical world with his recording of both concerti on the RCA label in what is now billed as the   legendary Moscow concert in 1984. Do you still remember the astonishment when you heard the wonderful playing and looking at the cover picture of a curly haired, cherubic lad of twelve sitting before a concert grand , gasped , my god , what a stupendous talent ! Well, Kissin is Kissin and plays Chopin's 2nd. with all the bravura and élan it deserves. With seemingly care-free abandon he attacks the fiendishly difficult passages  and carries all before him with his virtuosity, the larghetto, a dreamy paean to love and the allegro with great aplomb. What an ovation the audience gave him.           Comparisons are sometimes moot. On it's own merits this is a most satisfying concert disc of Chopin's two piano concertos, extremely well recorded and with impeccable performances by two of today's most sought after pianists, this should come high on the list of anybody wanting a modern audio- video recording of these two masterpieces.
031603441X|4.0|Told in the form of a conversation with his biographer, sitting around a table relating anecdotes from his life. The biographer then consults people mentioned in the anecdote for their thoughts on the incident. The result is a thoroughly entertaining account of Richards' life. The story has little structure aside from chronology and seems disjointed at times. The reductionist view would be: his love of R&B, his struggles with drugs, and his psychoanalysis of Mick Jagger. Jagger, oddly enough, is not one of the people consulted for their own views on the incidents related in the book. When you consider Richard's telling of their strained and distant relationship, that's not too surprising. Of particular interest are Richards' tales of growing up in postwar England, which is typical of what is most surprising about this book: the shear volume of things he remembers. Aided in part by diaries, his recollections have a level of detail that makes the storytelling rather entertaining. This is especially evident in the early years of the Rolling Stones when you get a clear picture of a group of like-minded individuals drawn together by a distinctly idiosyncratic genre of music which leads them, much to their surprise, into a maelstrom of popularity.    As for what kind of picture this paints of Richards, it's hard to say. He is forthcoming about his weaknesses, particularly about heroin usage, which he gave up some twenty years ago. But, he's silent on any negative impact cocaine and alcohol, which he has not given up, at least not, in the case of cocaine, until just recently, have had on his life. The juxtaposition of drug use and parenthood in the '70s make for a surreal portrait of someone offensively irresponsible or pathetically out of control. And who would have guessed he's an avid reader of Patrick O'Brian books?    His tales of this relationship with Jagger are long on amateur analysis of Jagger's personality and short on tangible accounts of their interactions, soit comes across as somewhat bitter. Especially striking is Richards' account of how Jagger's solo career was considered a stab in the back by Richards, but then Richards goes on to describe how rewarding his own solo career has been, without any acknowledgment of the seeming contradiction. There's also a pattern of Richards vaguely citing Charlie Watts as backing up Richards' account of traitorous acts by Jagger, without actually providing details about Watts' feelings on the subject (aside from one notable exception). The result is that you get the idea the whole story about the Richards/Jagger relationship is overly biased.    In the end, high marks for excellent editing by the author, it reads quite well despite the disjointed narrative structure. High marks for insight into the culture of the sixties and the role personalities in Richards' immediate circle played in forming that culture. High marks for touching on some musical details, in particular his preferred guitar tuning. Lower marks for not providing much of a glimpse into the dynamics of the interrelationships among the members of the Stones.
0199267189|5.0|I always wanted a collection of Shakespeare and this is the perfect one!<br />It is paperback, so I can carry it around and yet it contains the complete works.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|I was looking forward to seeing Star Wars in all its Blu-ray glory until I saw all the ridiculous changes George insists on doing with every new release.  Changes were tolerable in 1997 because it meant seeing SW on the big screen again.  Little did we know those ticket sales gave Lucas a green light to continue to \\"fix\\" these movies for decades to come.  Star Wars was a huge part of my childhood and I wanted the same for my children, unfortunately this box set isn't what I want them growing up with.
B003Y5H5AG|5.0|I took my daughter to see the new smurf movie in 3D and I have to say I was pleasently surprised after reading all of the negative reviews about it.  I grew up with the cartoon and now I get to experience them with my daughter.  I think it was a very cute and a well done movie.  I asked my daughter if she would have liked it better if it was a cartoon and she said no.  She is 6 years old and she loved it. The only thing I have to say that is negative about the movie is I can't get the song out of my head, and I can't stop talking smurf, ha-ha-ha-ha I like how they explained why there is only 1 girl smurf with having 99 male smurfs, I don't ever remember them explaining that in the cartoon.  I wish they would make a 2nd one where the smurfs get to come back and visit with the new baby.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|We get to just post our feelings here without actually reviewing something?  Cool!    I wish the nerds would just stop crying about the changes made to these movies.  These are Lucas' works and if he wants to change them, he can change them however he wants.  If he wants to add a scene of Obi-Wan pushing out a greasy dump in the Millennium Falcon's head, he can do it.  If he wants Han to groom lice off Chewbacca's back like a chimp grooming its mate, he can.  If he wants Yoda to wear a leopard print thong while battling Darth Sidious, he can.  He may potentially do all of this stuff because they are his movies!  Don't like the changes? Don't buy the releases!  I have a sneaking suspicion that the humans posting issues with the updated Star Wars releases are the same dorks who post issues with the L.O.T.R. theatrical releases.  These people have no life and just want reasons to complain.  At least Lucas gives them somthing to do with their lives other than watching interweb pron and playing world of warcraft.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|This is an application people, its just a game too!!! your not supposed to put Geo restriction on it. I cant believe you amazon!!! I HATE YOU.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Fun, relaxing, &quot;brain power&quot; game. Love the music too. Lots of levels, won't get bored. worth the price and more.
B0056BMK6K|4.0|If you are an author who will only be dragged to social media kicking and screaming, this book is for you.  You won't like it, because it goes against everything you'd dreamed writing would be (ie. all writing, no nasty business stuff).  If you're a long time pro at social media, the book may not be as informative, but I suspect there are still things even the experts can learn, because getting your e-book noticed and selling lots of copies is a universal struggle.<br /><br />I have not read Mr. Locke's books, nor indeed, would I fit his target market, but I like that he acts naturally and lays it out there for you.  There is no doubt Mr Locke comes from a marketing background, that much is obvious from the language.  But the book also offers the inexperienced a much better explanation of why to use social media to sell books, instead of the usual \\"you need to plaster yourself all over Twitter, Facebook, etc etc.\\"<br /><br />I very much appreciated the brevity of the book--as a rule, the business side of writing bores me, so I appreciate that he didn't drag the drudgery out over 300 pages and just got on with it.<br /><br />If you have any intention of selling digital books, it is well worth the price of the read.
0439796644|5.0|This is a touching book that kept my interest all through.  Although it is a children's book, I enjoyed it but must admit I got teary-eyed reading it.  Parts were very sad but I loved the ending!  Joey, the horse, tells his story about living on a farm with a boy named Albert and then being sold to the army because Albert's dad needed money to save his farm.  The horse goes through a lot but Albert never gives up looking for him.  This is the story of a loving bond between a horse and his owner.  It's a easy quick read.
1584282584|5.0|This book is a fantastic resource for those wanting to get serious about their flash technique. The author is extremely adept at explaining the book's concepts in an easy-to-understand format, but I'm going to end up reading it twice just to let this information penetrate deeper. The most important point I observed is how he's inspired me to get out of my comfort zone and shoot in Manual. If you're serious about your photography in general (besides mastering light augmentation with flash), this is a wonderful resource and I give it a full 5 stars.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Garbage. The revisions need to stop. There was nothing wrong with the original, theatrical releases. George Lucas needs to stop \\"fixing\\" things and give the fans what they know (or should that be \\"knew\\"?) and love.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|It's hard to believe that the same person who argued before congress over 20 years ago about the preservation of cinema has gone against his words and continually alters his own movies!    Lucas has given numerous excuses as to why he can't remaster the originals for an updated home video release. He has said that the original negatives were destroyed to make the special editions, I find it hard to believe that a filmmaker would be so callous that he would destroy the only remaining negative of his original work. I also find it hard to believe that there are not multiple 35mm prints that are in decent condition and could be restored for a brilliant HD presentation.     His most recent excuse is that it would just cost too much. Last I checked, Lucas is worth over 3 billion dollars, how expensive would a full restoration be? 20 million? 40 million? Either way, that's chump change to Lucas! I'm willing to bet that if every die hard fan gave 5 dollars to restore the original films, they would be paid for hand over fist! There have even been professionals within the film restoration industry that have offered their services for free!    I have not purchased the original trilogy on home media format since the last VHS release in 1995! Every time a new release is announce, I secretly hope to hear the words \\"Including the original trilogy, unaltered, fully restored!\\" Unfortunately in 2006, what we got was sub-par letterbox versions minted from a laser-disc master from 1993! I know of no other film maker that has such a disdain for his fans as George Lucas...I am a huge fan of the franchise but his constant tinkering leaves me very bitter.    I was actually considering buying the blu-ray set until I heard of the unnecessary inclusion of Darth Vader crying \\"Nooooo\\" when he kills the emperor...it lessens the impact and emotion of that scene. Other unnecessary inclusions being the altered Krayt dragon call Obi-Wan uses to scare off the Sand People (this was actually altered before for the 2004 release). And also, Ewoks now have the ability to blink!    I'm not saying that Lucas has no right to change and alter his movies, they are after all his. What I do not appreciate is that he refuses to give his fans a choice.
B0024F08UG|5.0|On Blu-ray this is a perfect DVD. I like it better than when it was in theaters. Extraordinary cast, and unfortunately most of the main characters are now gone. But, it is good to see them together in this movie. Steve McQueen, Paul Newman, Fred Astaire, and many other stars we grew up watching. Because of the TWIN TOWERS this was delayed for video. It is a collectible for all DVD collectors. Bought it on Amazon too.
076790592X|5.0|Not sure how people can dislike this book.  It's a very honest, touching memoir about a student saying goodbye to his dying teacher.  It's honest and heartfelt, and will seriously make you think about your own mortality.  It's about how we examine our lives as we begin to realize that that life is coming to an end.  Yet it manages to be very uplifting, even despite it's depressing subject matter.    Don't get me wrong, it's a bit manipulative and it absolutely tugs at the heartstrings from start to finish.  But the story is true and makes you admire both the author and Morrie, the subject matter.    Bring a box of Kleenex, however.  It's a tearjerker.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|first time i have ever cancelled a pre-order. He lost me at Noooooooooo...Art is getting it to where you like it and then walking away.
B004M9AS3Y|4.0|This is a great bag, made well, and love the handle that is part of the top of the shoulder straps. There are plenty of pockets. This bag is NOT a shelf-in-a-suitcase for lenses. It also does NOT fit a 17\\" MacBook Pro. I measured the dimensions before purchasing, and noted that it would fit. A couple of comments elsewhere mentioned that this laptop would fit. Alas it does not. Great bag, though, and I use it anyway, with my laptop sticking out of the unclosed top.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Once again, George Lucas shows nothing but disdain for his own products and his fan base.  To needlessly add dialog when none existed changes what made the films great.  But of course he doesn't remove the bain of our existence, Jar Jar Binks.
B003BWERF8|3.0|This product works (worked) great, and performs as advertised with my iPod. It has excellent range and is very easy to use. I LOVED it until it broke. It is quite fragile. It no longer works after only 6 months. It was only subjected to normal wear-and-tear. I suggest being VERY careful with it. Never drop it, or place it in your pocket while it's attached to your iPod. If it were more durable, I would rate this product with 5 stars.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Even the deleted scenes and the inclusion of the vintage documentaries are not enough to overcome the absurdity of Lucas' insistence with continuing to tinker with the original trilogy.<br /><br />I will remain happy watching my non-anamorphic DVDs on a 4:3 CRT.<br /><br />I wouldn't be surprised if he added Ventress to the cockpit of Dooku's solar sailer and Ahsoka to the padawan scenes.  Don't laugh, it will happen.<br /><br />I'm done.  I will never spend another cent on any Star Wars related item ever again, unless it's a nice 1080p transfer of the original theatrically released trilogy...hell, I would spend $100 each for those.
B000001GQC|5.0|This is an excellent recording and, although it was anticpiated to take up to a month to arrive, it appeared pretty quickly. I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates Prokofiev.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is the first book I read on my Kindle and I was not disappointed!  Although there are many options for historical fiction set during WWII, this story is a unique, engaging, beautiful story of a German girl dealing with horrible circumstances well beyond her control.  The fact that it is narrated by \\"death\\" gives it a unique mood, but not as you might think.  As the narrator, Death is compassionate and eloquent.  Although my husband could not get into the story, I was hooked!  I would highly recommend it, placing it at the top of the list for anyone interested in WWII or a great book about the perseverance of a girl growing up in unimaginable circumstances.
0553801473|1.0|I was really excited when this came out.  Then I started to read it.  There are a few great chapters but the bad ones were really bad.  EVERY Dany chapter was the same.  I just dreaded when I saw her chapter come up.  Then I came to the last 100 pages.  I won't put spoilers, but I did want to throw the book against a wall at one point.  Book was way to long and just dragged.
B004YXE438|5.0|Simple yet addictive puzzle game. The fact that you can use your own pictures makes it very replay-able. One of the best games I have downloaded.
055358894X|5.0|Excellent book.  Fresh and fun characters.  I was instantly drawn in.  I do want a prequel though.  SO much back story is missing.
B000001EL3|5.0|I just want to say that Kiss is one of the greatest rock n roll bands ever!!!!!!!!! This albums proves that anybody that doesnt have this album is not a rock n roller. Also I want to say Ace Frehley is a very underated guitar player i put him up there with all the legends. Great album buy it!!!!!!!!!

B005COO1X6|4.0|Mile 81 is a brisk little story, weighing in at just 850 locations on the Kindle with an excerpt of 11/23/61 filling another 200 locations.  For the first time in quite a while we are treated to a pure creature feature from King, in the form of a very hungry car.<br /><br />King's characters as a rule are rich and funny and that is no different in Mile 81.  Over the course of the story we get nine characters, each of which are fleshed out surprisingly well for as short of a tale as this is.  A few times King gets caught in his traditional trap of having single digit kids sound much older than they are, sounding more like teenagers than the four, six and ten year olds they are.  The characters are written with such voice and heart that it is easy to forgive.<br /><br />The monster itself is basically a Chevy Angler fish, tantalizing good Samaritans into looking at the bait and then quite literally feasting on them.  In a short time, King manages to make the nameless station wagon more terrifying than his Buick or Christine.<br /><br />It's a great story and exactly what I was hoping for when Kindle singles were introduced.  It won't be for everyone and certainly feels like it could have been part of Nightmares and Dreamscapes.  If you are looking for a quick hitting creature book though, it will be hard to do much better.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|As far as I'm concerned nothing beats this searies...NOTHING! Funny, original, different, and tipping a hat to anybody with a bit of rebellion.
B004WKOCP8|3.0|I was excited when I purchased this album thinking it would be like all the other CDs from Incubus. The only song I like is Adolescents. I miss the music from Morning View and Make Yourself album. I am hoping there next release will top this album. This cd seems too somber for them.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I just removed this from my wish list when I discovered that Mr. Lucas decided he needed(yet again!) to make even more changes to the films.    [...]    I think that for a lot of us star wars fans, we just wanted to see the movies we saw as kids. There are some pretty horrible changes he made in original re-release. As a prime example, and the one that's probably been discussed the most: Han shot first, it an intrinsic part of his character development in the first film. Shooting in retaliation makes him far less of a 'scoundrel'.     There were other additions that I didn't mind. Like fixing some of the SFX stuff, cleaning up the audio, addition of a couple of deleted scenes(Jabba at the Millenium Falcon). Things they were unable to do with the tech at the time. Those added to the movie rather than take away from it. It's the major structural changes, like Han shooting first, and now adding \\"Noooooo\\"(one of the most ridiculed parts of the prequals) to what I formally thought was one of the best scenes in the film, that are so infuriating.    The scene was so emotionally powerful before with Vader's silence. With no facial expression, they were able to convey the emotional turmoil of watching his son being killed by the Emperor. The added dialogue makes the scene seem so melodramatic.    Has there ever been a director that has played so much with every release of his films?
B002ZG980U|5.0|I love Christopher Nolan (loved his Memento, too) Great film! It's one of the few movies that I can watch again and again and still enjoy it every time. It's a fascinating mind bender.
034552554X|2.0|I was interested in this novel because the central character is struggling with the emotional consequences of foster/institutional care.  However, I found the book an inauthentic, idealized rendering of the aftermath of childhood trauma.  The author cherry picks traits to create \\"rugged individuals\\" --  her characters' main dysfunction is distaste/lack of need for life's lighter, more frivolous side (TV, casual social relationships), but otherwise function well in day-to-day life regarding work and love relationships.   This is not only true of Victoria but also of Grant; Elizabeth was a bit more authentic, but not much and she was a minor character.  (I found Victoria's  protests that she couldn't stay with Grant an idea forced on the reader for the purpose of the plot, not one demonstrated through descriptions of her or her behavior in the relationship).     The author also contrives plot points way too much -- the horrible foster parents (32 of them -- they make her eat dog food??), the midwife, Victoria's successful flower business, the magic her customers find with flowers.    On the bright side, I loved the opening line/scene with fire and the book is not poorly written -- it flows well and was engaging enough to hold my interest.      \\"Chick lit\\" -- this epithet frequently appeared when I did a web search on The Language of Flowers.  I'm not really a fan of chick lit and I wish I would have done the web search (rather than rely on the NPR interview or the many positive customer reviews) before I decided to purchase the book.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|I feel Jaycee did a great job of telling her story.  I could feel her pain of loneliness and fear.  All that she endured will stay with me forever but I will also always remember how joyous it felt when she was finally able to go home again. Wonderful!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book is a total kick in the pants.   Read it. Now. No, don't wait for the paper version, slide on your visor and haptic glove and dowload it now.
B004MKM8L8|5.0|box was scratched, but disk was perfect and thats all that really matters. great value at ten dollars, doubt I could buy it for q lower price anywhere else
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Recommended to me by a co-worker.. i read the first few pages and wasn't convinced, but she insisted i finish. Once i got into the first chapter, i was hooked. i couldn't put it down and read the whole series in 2 weeks. Compelling, exciting and easy to read. Highly recommended for people of all ages.
B005KGPBM6|5.0|Kevin Smith's Red State pulled the carpet out from under me over and over again. This movie had so many twists and turns, keeping me guessing from start to finish. Until you see the closing credits, it's impossible to even guess that this is a Kevin Smith film.    I waited months and months to see Red State since the tour began in March, but Kevin never brought the film here to Dallas. I waited up all night to see Red State, and it finally popped up at 5:00 am. It was well worth the wait. Although I never expected the things I saw in this film, it still met my personal expectations after all the months of hype from Smodcast.com and S.I.R. radio.    The movie left me feeling empty, sad, and hopeless. The things that happened on the screen in front of me made me feel disgusted, shocked, appalled and speechless.     I loved every single minute of it.    If Michael Parks and Melissa Leo don't get nominated for any awards this winter, it would be an absolute shame.    Do yourselves a favor: watch this movie with your friends, your girlfriend, your boyfriend, whatever! This movie needs to be watched with more than one person as it is absolutely priceless to turn and see your friends' reactions to the horror that is Red State.    5/5
0300169787|4.0|One of the most beautiful exhibits I've ever seen. I'm usually skeptical of fashion exhibits, but the curators really did an amazing job. The book accurately reflects the exhibition and the breadth of this work. I would've given it 5 stars, but that's only if you've seen the exhibit. So 4 if you haven't, 5 if you have.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I've been duped and disapointed to many times in the past. I have no intrest in purchasing this box set.
B004529NLG|5.0|THIS WAS THE BEST 3D MOVIE OUT SO FAR. THE DANCING N ACTING IN THIS MOVIE WAS AWESOME N THEN THE 3D EFFECTS WAS INCREDIBLE
0141040378|5.0|i was so excited to order a classic book with such a beautiful and well thought design.  i love this book, and also love that making my library pretty isn't a lost art in the age of electronic readers.  i am so excited for my daughters to discover this book when they are grown and also excited for their admiration that will undoubtedly come from the smart design.
B004SKIPXW|5.0|There were so many 3d effects in this movie n besides that i thought the movie was awesome also so I give this movie a 5
B003UY0ZFS|5.0|I heard the song Je veux for the first time two days ago. I have listened to the album several times already and read translations of all lyrics. I love Zaz and her voice. But most of all I love all the emotions that this album brings. And when you watch her perform life you see that she really feels what she sings. It's truly beautiful!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Look, I read the reviews first and then saw the video clip of Vader.  I was ready to hate it because of what I'd read, but it actually makes sense.  In the scene we see Anakin Skywalker reasserting himself over the evil that Vader represented in his life.  The parallel to Anakin's anguish after discovering that Padme was dead  is good because love for his family and the realization of that loss is what drove Anakin to the dark side to begin with (both with his mother in Episode II and his wife in Episode III). The fact that Anakin's love for his son (more family) drives him back to the light and the EMOTION OF THAT MOMENT when he finally comes back and essentially sacrifices himself; I'm sorry, that moment deserves something more than just silence from Vader/Anakin.  It's way too significant.
B003INBOE2|5.0|Very nice, Excellent quality,  wonderful choreography,  Yen gives a great  portrayal as the quiet humble, classy master.<br /><br />\\"We want to open a Kung-Fu school, so need to fight you to show our skills\\"<br /><br />\\"You do not need to fight me, all you need is a good location\\" ...classic<br /><br />I will be buying IP man II
B001JRB16U|5.0|I had a terrible time trying to find this movie, which was a shock to me. Apparamtly most have seen it or don't care.It is, without a doubt, one of the best movies ever. Delightfuly entertaining.I am SO happy I found it on Amazon and for a good price, too ! This IS a classic that everyone should see and have.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|The only downside to this collection is that they substituted the original music with alternative songs.  But considering those songs play for a only few seconds between scenes it's a minor blemish on this excellent series.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Lucas continues to ruin the Star Wars original movies. He's making Return of the Jedi worse. I didn't think that could happen.    Buy yourself the DVD's that included the laserdisc transfers of the original versions. You'll be happier. Even the 2004 DVD's are relatively acceptable. But these new changes they have made... well, it's just gone too far.     Don't buy this. Speak with your wallet. It would be like colorizing Casablanca and only releasing that version from now on. Make Lucas restore his classic, award winning films the way they should be.     I repeat, do not buy this. Borrow it from a friend. I have a friend named TPB and his friend Demon... something. I know they'll let me borrow it.
0805047905|5.0|This was my son's favorite book when he was 18 months old.  He's over two now and still loves it.  Also, my four year-old loves it because he can \\"read\\" it to the younger one.
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|Having enjoyed the previous Nikki Heat novel, I quickly bought this one as well, and it didn't disappoint. It's a fun, well-written book; not very complicated, but absolutely entertaining. Someone who doesn't know the series would probably enjoy it as well (especially if they have read Heat Wave), but it is much better if you do know the series.  The (real) writer has found a good balance for the 'fiction-within-fiction' that it is. It is filled with references to the series, but also interesting as a work in itself. The differences between the show and the book are a reference in itself, they are just the sort of thing Richard Castle would change.  The plot is good as well, building on Nikki Heat and Jameson Rook's history when they run into each other again at a celebrity murder scene. The case is not obvious and has some believable and interesting characters, and I enjoyed reading it till the last page.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|We want the GOD-DAMNED ORIGINALS!!!!   When I heard the movies were coming out on Blu-ray I was so excited, ready to buy the whole set the day it came out, even buying the goofy prequels.  But now to learn that they won't contain the original unaltered versions and that Lucas has changed EVEN MORE, again, for the umpteenth time, I will not be buying them at all.       I'm sick of his meddling. Usually when a director releases a \\"special cut\\" of his/her film it is actually improved.  (Aliens, Blade Runner, Brazil)  Somehow this idea seems to be lost on Lucas, who seems to be hell-bent on seeing just how BAD he can make his films before his loyal fans finally refuse to take it anymore.           Maybe this is some sort of JEDI TEST, like how Luke was able to see the good in Vader, perhaps our beloved movies are slowly turning to the darkside, and we, as fans, must be strong with the force and continue to find the good in them.      I, for one, am dropping out of the Jedi Training Academy. And I don't think I'm alone.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I'm thoroughly pleased with the new PS3 controllers... however, I was a bit disappointed by the fact that you have to order a seperate usb cable for the controller. I'm thinking that doesn't make sense. All in all, and an extra six bucks later... it's good stuff! :D

0393338827|5.0|I seriously can't help but constantly laugh to myself as I read this book.  It's refreshing to see someone approach the subprime crisis from the angle of 'how did the dumbest guys in the room get tricked into causing this crisis and get away with it' instead of 'how did the smartest guys in the room fail'.  The book is extremely detailed and traces the money every step of the way, focuses on the massive inefficiencies that were present at every level of the mortgage bond market, and presents it all from the perspective of some hilarious characters that couldn't believe this was all going on under everyone's noses.  This book is an extremely entertaining read and yet it doesn't try to shield the user from much of the technical aspects of the subprime fiasco.  I haven't had this much fun reading non-fiction in a very long time.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I was anxious to buy this new edition on blu ray for my 5-yr old nephew - he loves Star Wars toys, the rides at Disney World, Star Wars legos, etc. This would be his first time seeing the movies, and I was excited to give this to him for Christmas. However, after reading other reviews about MORE \\"changes\\", and then having this sad news confirmed over the last few days in the press, I will NOT be buying this crap. I loved Star Wars as a kid, had all the toys, joined the \\"Star Wars Fan Club\\", saw all the movies many times...and I absolutely agree with those that say Lucas has destroyed his legacy by not only continuing to attempt to revise history, but by refusing to give the fans that appreciated his work the way it was (and hence brought him the fame and fortune which he is squandering) the films in their original form that they remember from childhood (and which caused them to fall in love with Star Wars in the first place). Booooooooooooo George Lucas. I'll just have to show my nephew my copies on VHS. I will not contribute to his Evil Empire.
0345529057|5.0|This is by far the most affordable set to own, even the kindle version is more expensive(for some reason). I am about half way through book one and it has not shown any signs of falling apart like I read in some of the other reviews.
B0034G4ORC|4.0|What a great war, sci fi and action film. The reminds me of District 9 in the look and feel of it and takes a few minutes of getting used to. But after that it's really good and keeps your interest. The special effects are good as well but does not take over the film. Also you care about the characters as well.  Highly recommended.
B0042QNP2S|1.0|The collection arm, the thing that makes the whole thing possible, is poorly designed. I purchased one which arrived broken. I've heard of many others having the same issue and/or the same piece breaks 1-2 weeks. It is a beautiful truck otherwise. Wish it would have worked out. In the end, we bought another truck for $30 and it is a winner!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|The new Darth Vader says NOOoooo has ruined one of the most powerfull scenes in all of the Star Wars movies.  George has often said that movies aren't finished, they're just abandoned, well George it's time to let go, you should have left these movies abandoned years ago.  I would love to vote with my wallet and not buy this BD set but that's a message that's not going to get through and besides there's so much good stuff on this that I want to see.  I guess I'll buy this and just cringe in discust at the new 'NO' scene along with all the other changes we've had over the years.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|George Lucas to the model builders and special effects crew who worked on the first trilogy from 1977-1983:<br /><br />\\"Your feeble skills are no match for the power of CGI.\\"<br /><br />(Lightning bolts come from George's hands and are frying his crew members)<br /><br />George Lucas to these same people as well as all Star Wars fans who wish George wouldn't tinker around with all six movies:<br /><br />\\"You will pay the price for your lack of vision.\\"<br /><br />(Lightning bolts are frying his crew members AND his fans)<br /><br />Collectively, everybody says to George, \\"George, please!!!!!\\"<br /><br />(Everybody continues to get fried by the lightning bolts)<br /><br />George Lucas:<br /><br />\\"Now crew, fans, and all six movies.....................you WILL die.\\"<br /><br />(Lightning bolts are even more intense and everybody is screaming in agony)<br /><br />George wins, but only if you buy this set.

B004EJUMT2|4.0|The hype would have you believe one of two things: 1) GHOST are the second-come/greatest-thing-since-sliced-bread or 2) GHOST are an over-exposed gimmick.  I say, \\"listen for yourself.\\"  GHOST write very catchy hard rock/heavy metal with clean SUNG vocals!  The songs are wonderfully crafted!  The theme, style, etc. may or may NOT be your cup of tea.  I think it's great!  I wish my version had the \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" bonus track on it!
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Have both the SB-900 flash and the SB-400. While the 900 has a lot of features and sheer flash power, I use the SB-400 probably 90% of the time. It's small, simple on/off and ready light, allows bounce flash, and produces a strong flash when needed. Difficult to beat for routine fill flash and a grab-and-go flash. This is an additional SB-400 so each camera bag now has one without having to move them around. None have ever failed. Unless shooting weddings or large rooms, this is the one flash to have in your bag.

0345529057|5.0|While I can only comment on book one Game of Thrones at this point, I can say that this book is one of the best fantasy style books I've read since JRR Tolkien.
1400069181|5.0|I enjoyed this book; I was truthfully looking for a book to help get me out of my rut and start something that mattered. I was a little worried when I realized that for the most part (95%) is about starting a BUSINESS that matters. If you aren't looking to start a business, then you may want to check this book out of the library.     However, the positivity of this book is amazing. I wish my employers had the attitude and caring that Mycoskie and those few rare employers that really do care about their product and their employees have.     Mycoskie tells about how he started his business called TOMS and what he did to get it where it is now. The difference between this business and most others? He started it to give back to the world, shoes for children - well anyone that needs them. Buy a pair, he donates a pair.     He also writes about how a company really needs to be like a family (my POV) that no one person is more important than the other and everyone needs to trust and work together. You have to trust your employees and in return they will trust you.    He tells about his keys, and other CEO's keys, to success and ways to give back to society and why we should too.     So, since I'm not starting a business what do I think of it? I actually would recommend people read it. Why? Because it makes you think.  If you're stuck in a rut (like I was) then change it, you have the power to. Better yet, change it by helping others.     I read this book in one day, I smiled and cried at the stories of people who went on these shoe drops (the TOMS company takes any employees that want to go and some customers to do this to some part of the world) and see how much it changed their lives, that they were making a difference to children and people who could never afford to own shoes.     As Mycoskie notes, you don't need a fortune or everything at your fingertips to make it happen, in fact its better that you don't. But start now, and start by giving to others.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I really like the 30 Day Shred. Having been sick for several years and unable to work out, this video has been my link to getting back into shape. The key is the three different intensity levels of the workout - you can move up when you're feeling stronger or stay on your current level if you're not. I am thin, but without much strength, due to having been ill for so long. But after two days of doing Stage 1 of the workout, I felt my strength begin to return. I am now a month into the workout and not only do I have strength, I feel toned. I like to alternate this video with Jillian's No More Trouble Zones workout video. I still have to modify some of the moves since I am starting from square one, but I still see results. Some elements of the workout may not be good if you have weak knees, but what workout doesn't have that element? I simply modify the move to put less stress on the knees and keep going.     Some of the reviews have stated they do not like Jillian's personality. Well, I do like her. She is no nonsense, REAL and encouraging to those of us who want to give up! She doesn't jump all over the place with all kinds of difficult moves. Everything is basic and very effective. And for those who are bothered by the fact she doesn't count the reps, I am not! I don't want to get stuck in the \\"Oh, help, I have eight more reps to go!\\" mentality. I just go until she counts three left to go and I am done. Her circuit training method is really effective and keeps the workout from being boring. I can literally feel the burn during the entire workout. And I have muscle definition that was not there before!    I also have her Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism video that I will start using in about another month. I can't wait!

B000HWZ4A2|3.0|Ayn Rand wrote about man being the best he can be. This discarded both religion and large government (in some cases the same thing). The book was written to uplift man and to make you think about being the best that you can be. Its basis was that if you were like everyone else, it is mediocrity at best a lousy life. If everyone was a sheep, we would be lead to slaughter. That is it! This means, stand on your own two feet, be the best you can, do the best you can, period. As I mentioned, this did exclude religion and government, so it pretty much ticks many people off. Did this movie capture the essence of the book, sort of. I would say that reading the book and seeing the movie are both unique experiences as Ayn Rand did the screen play, but the subtleties were missed in my opinion. It is hard to capture a book that large in 120 minutes. I travel a lot, I have a kindle (no plug here) and could take the time to read it and understand its meaning. The movie barely gets the little subtleties that made the book so great. It did capture the point of Roark not taking the money from the weaker man even when he was almost completely broke and turning down a job that would have saved him because it was compromised in his view. It is a thinking movie and therefore probably disliked by many shallow just want an escape type of movie people, it is certainly not that. Its relevance to today's political and socio-economic standards is frankly uncanny. She hit a lot of today's issues dead on 70+ years ago? Wow, also, not too many reviews point out her biography as it is interesting in itself. She was born in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1905, she saw the Bolshevik revolution and first hand saw her successful family's livelihood taken for the \\"greater good\\". Her disdain for this is evident in her writings and why so many conservatives like her as she is for capitalism and small government. However, as mentioned above, this disdain is also aimed at religion in which she also sees as a crutch. I personally like the lesson and try to do the best I can at what I do as I feel it is the best way to live, proud of your accomplishments and your integrity. Could I live up to a Howard Roark? I wish! I feel a couple of times in my life when integrity mattered, I took the hit and I will tell you I was alone in a crowded room, but I am not more proud of any other moment(s) in my life other than when my child was born. I think that is her message, when you do something based on integrity when the chips are down, it is a good thing. To my sad realization, I have seen many other situations like this since and seen others who chose to be like Roark as I did get the ugly end of a deal. For the record the last guy I saw hold his integrity in the face of loosing everything was a very religious man. Take it for the deeper meaning, it was meant to move you, not comment on Cooper or the director; those are far from the point of her writings.

B004SDSSFY|1.0|Downloaded, installed, and registered it then headed out to my graduate class. Took two hours of notes in Google Docs mode. Everything looked great. App crashed while I was on the way home. Apparently this piece of crap doesn't auto-save when you open & edit an existing document, and there's no place in the settings ANYWHERE to change that. My notes are GONE. Document on Google Docs (which I had created on a computer before heading out of the house) is empty, no revision history. While poking around in the settings to try to see if there was some way to recover my notes, I opened another Google Doc that I had already worked on and saved it to SD card. Program crashed in the middle of this process. Opened program again, navigated to document (at least THIS time the effing thing showed up in my \\"recent docs\\" section instead of just disappearing entirely). Tried to run Word Count. Crashed. Tried again. Crashed again. I don't have time for this BS. I'm uninstalling, trying to get a refund (thank goodness at least I got it on sale) and installing QuickOffice instead. I need the ability to edit files offline, and I'm not thrilled with the paragraph navigation in the native Google Docs app (and lack of word count - in addition to being a grad student I am also working on a novel, and some of my grad work also needs word count such as for abstracts and such) or I'd not bother paying any of them. Rubbish.

B004G600A4|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised at just how entertaining and delightful the movie Tangled was. My youngest daughter absolutely fell in love with the characters and has talked about this movie for over a week. If you haven't already seen it, I recommend you pop some popcorn and get to watching. It's great entertainment for the whole family. My husband even enjoyed it!

B004SBX112|4.0|my favorite thing about the angry birds games is the challenges within the challenges! even after beating the levels, you have the golden eggs or fruits and three stars to look forward to working on.
B00001W9G0|1.0|I ordered this DVD, as well as two other favorites. After viewing the other movie and having constant interruptions or periods where the DVD froze so that I couldn't even finish watching the movie, I opened The Way We Were to determine if I had received a bad copy. While there were not as many interruptions or periods where the tape froze, I still experienced the same interruptions. At that point, I didn't even open the 3rd movie because I decided to return all three. Then I saw that I had to return within 30 days. Unfortunately I had just had an opportunity to watch the DVDs. Therefore, if I am not able to exchange the DVDs for better quality replacements, I will not re-order DVDs from Amazon.
B002UXRGLG|5.0|This is the first time I am watching a nature program. That's simply wonderful; there's lot of things I might not be able to go and watch for myself. BBC has done a wonderful job for us. Every moment of the 4 disc video is enjoyable.     The shipping experience is awesome. I asked for a 2nd day delivery, of course this was the quickest free delivery I could afford. They arrived on time.    However, when watching the discs I found that the discs were skipping sequences from my DVD player. I carefully observed the discs. I found there were long black marks on the disc due to over use of the player. Except one of the discs, that had a delicate scratch.     To resolve I simply wrote an email describing my experience, and ask them to advise. Before even I get a reply I received a new set of the DVD in my front door.     To my knowledge and expectation this would is the best I would expect.
B000AYEL1A|1.0|I am extremely disappointed with the quality of this DVD and have it packed and ready to ship back until I saw that it had to be returned within 30 days. The movie continuously skips throughout. I had not had the opportunity to watch it until this past weekend but with the constant interruptions, I couldn't even finish watching the movie. I then watched The Way We Were and found that it too had interruptions though not as often as A Star Is Born. I didn't even bother to open The Way We Were (it's still in the original packaging) since I had such bad luck with the other two. I love all these movies and am wondering why they are of such poor quality. I've not ordered movies from Amazon before but if I'm not able to exchange them for better quality DVDs, this will be the last order I will place. Is there any way I can exchange?
B001285G4Y|4.0|DVD plays well and has excellent video and audio quality.  As a foreign produced product that works on U.S. DVD players, operating instructions for \\"pause,\\" \\"stop,\\" etc. were included on a piece of paper included in the case.  It was easy to learn how to operate.  'Great classic movie!
B005EP1PJQ|4.0|I really liked this book, so much so that I had trouble putting it down. Specifically, I liked the slow tension filled build-up between Anna and St. Clair as they progressed from being friends to starting to mean more to each other; this was definitely my favourite part of the book.<br /><br />Even though she develops a crush on St. Clair the moment she lays eyes on him (blah!), I really like Anna. I think she's portraits a realistic image of how a teenage girl might be, with her passions, insecurities and selective blindness to certain hints thrown her way. St. Clair makes a great, but flawed, romantic hero as he too has his weaknesses and imperfections. However, his charm and positive spirit far outweighs his flaws. And that accent... you just gotta love a boy with an English accent! I seriously read it in an English accent in my mind, just to make it sweeter (I'm not crazy, really).<br /><br />As much as I liked the book, I do have a few minor objections: I thought the ending was somewhat weaker than the beginning and the middle of the book. It feels a little rushed to me, with everything tied up in a neat little bow in the final chapter. Also, I never felt like I got a proper answer to the question of why Anna's father insisted on sending her to boarding school in a foreign country, especially when she was so opposed to it herself. Also, where did St. Clair's intense fear of heights stem from? And why on earth would his father want to keep him from seeing his mother? Even though St. Clair's daddy was a douche bag, he must have had some other reason for acting the way he did than simply for the sake of douchiness itself, mustn't he? It feels like he must. However, these are minor objections to an otherwise wonderful book.<br /><br />All in all, this book is definitely worth reading, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes contemporary romance. Anna and the French Kiss whisked me away to a time in my life when a crush on a boy completely could take over my raison d'être. Of course, I never had any classmates like &Eacute;tienne St. Clair and I praise myself lucky for that, or I never would have been able to get anything done.course, I never had any classmates like Étienne St. Clair and I praise myself lucky for that, or I never would have been able to get anything done.
0307477479|5.0|This book sucked me right in and I was gripped by every word.  Great language and energy and format.  Every story/chapter could probably stand alone, but they build on each other, adding subtle layers and depth to characters.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Why waste your time with this set? The person who's created this universe for us has decided to constantly change it without offering the original versions for us. What can you expect from these altered blu-rays? How about blinking Ewoks and more \\"NOOOOOOO!\\" from Darth Vader. Don't give Mr. Lucas your money, save it for something else that matters. Like the Blade Runner blu-ray set that contains EVERY VERSION OF THE MOVIE.
B0025KW29U|3.0|I picked this up for a few reasons: all-star cast, Joss Whedon, and the admirable way the profits were being distributed to the crew during the writers strike (which had hit Hollywood film crew workers hard).  It had rave reviews all over the internet, so I was expecting something very entertaining.  What I got instead was a quick, low-budget, badly written musical with the production quality of a YouTube video.  I was very disappointed with the film itself.  One nice bonus though is the commentary that is done completely in song.  I hate to recommend against this product, but it just isn't worth the time.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|Hunger Games paints a metaphor of an existence where government has such control over the life's of its citizens they decide who lives and dies.  They are not so daring as to kill citizens in mass and provoke open revolt, instead yearly they take from among the young, the best of their lot and pit them in a life and death contest. Only a sole survivor lives. Viewing this contest is mandatory for all citizens.<br /> It's really a story about man's inhumanity towards their fellow man. A story that warns when man gains too much control over the life of others they will abuse that sometimes to the extreme, as exampled by our own history and the brutality we inflicted on the slaves at the birth of this nation.<br />  Hunger Games begs the reader to ponder what life really means and to consider that Golden Rule, \\" Do Unto Others As You Would Have Others Do Unto Your\\"  Yet is written is such a fresh, youthful way that it was destined to be a best seller among sci fi fans.

B002RBZ12W|5.0|The vinyl version of this album is excellent!  Higher definition than CD, every thing is more easliy heard and even more powerfull.  Guitar riffs are spectacular, the base guitar and drums heard clearly and not muddled and deminished like that on a CD or lesser recording.  I love it and when I set my head unit to Concert Hall it's even better.  The \\"live\\" sound is definitly there.  If you enjoy the sound of a turntable and are a fan of Rammstein, I suggest you give this a listen.  If your turntable is sitting there gathering dust, dust it off, get a fresh stylus and enjoy.    As always amazon delivered quickly and packs there vinyl albums well.  Arrived in great shape.
1401216676|5.0|I've just begun reading comics and don't know much about the DC Universe.  The Killing Joke stands on its own as a self-contained, complete story.  The art work is stunning and the story keeps you turning the pages.  If you like Batman, you'll love The Killing Joke.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Cancelled my pre-order today.  As a fan of the original movies, it kills me when Lucas adds in extras to a movie just because he feels it makes it \\"better\\".  Yes, it's his property and he can do with it what he wants, but it still doesn't mean he SHOULD.  Adding in Christensen at the end of ROTJ was bad enough in the DVD release, now adding in another \\"Noooooo!\\", CGI eyelids and a terrible redo of the Krayt Dragon call seals, or rather unseals, the deal on buying the blu-ray edition.  As a fan of the Original trilogy, please George, release the original, unaltered versions of the movies on Blu-Ray.  I won't fall for this bait and switch(adding deleted scenes while altering established ones).  AND HAN SHOT FIRST!!!!!!!!!!
B0058OUJA4|5.0|Pros:    - This game is actually a challenge without being unfair. I've managed to beat most of the levels (on normal difficulty, sometimes I need to do it on easy), but it's definitely not the type of game that you always win.    - Since I've downloaded it (about a week or two ago) they've released quite a few new levels. You can skip around and play any level you like, so it seems like there's always something fresh to try.    - 3 difficulty settings, if it's too hard you can bump it down to easy.     - Simple design, yet nice visuals.      Cons:    - This is a very minor issue, but you have to drag and drop the turrets onto the grid. Occasionally a turret will get \\"dropped\\" without me lifting my finger from the screen. Not sure if it's the game, my touch screen, or me actually just lifting my finger slightly/ moving too fast.        On a side note: This isn't really a game that you can play in a quick 2 minute break, like you can with Angry Birds. Each level is pretty quick, but it might take 10 minutes or so, and you may need to replay it a few times before beating it. There's a bit of a learning curve, it requires strategy and a decent amount of persistence, but it's definitely worth it.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|I will not be buying this after the confirmed changes (Vader now says NOOOOO as he destroys the Emperor).    I am a true fan of the original series and even though I disagreed with some of the changes George Lucas made for his \\"Special Editions\\" of the films I came to accept them as his true vision for the films (not my vision, but his vision).      Now he has changed his mind and is altering the films yet again.  Why?  Because he CAN.  Artistic integrity has nothing to do with it, the director's vision has nothing to do with it, he's doing it because he has the power to do it.    I'm sorry, but this is the end of the line for me guys.  Enough is enough.  I am drawing a line in the sand on this. I WILL NOT GIVE THIS MAN ANY MORE MONEY FOR THESE BASTARDISED VERSIONS OF THESE CLASSIC FILMS.     NO MORE.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|George Lucas has somehow managed to transform the greatest trilogy of all time into a reworked a convoluted mess so terrible it completely tarnishes what he originally created.     DO NOT BUY THIS BOX SET AND DO NOT SUPPORT GEORGE LUCAS ANYMORE!

B001RTSPVY|5.0|What a strange story.  Sad part is that is so believable.  Quite a difference from Malcolm in the Middle role.  Haven't watched the whole thing yet but can't wait to see what happens.  Being a smoker, I can definitely feel for the guy and hope that his cancer goes away.  But it's hard to watch sometimes and see what drugs can do to people.  Very scary.  Delivery was great.
B005KGPC4S|4.0|I saw this in the theater and loved it. It's not your typical Smith movie.  You can't instantly tell it was written/directed by him with in two minutes of watching the film (not that that's a bad thing).  A good plot with out the cookie cutter formula of movies today. Definitely worth the $10 to watch. I've pre-ordered the Bluray too.
B003UMW68Y|5.0|I bought this item just because.  Have seen the movie and LOVED IT!  But had to have it on blu-ray so bought it again.  Delivery was great.
B003L20ICE|2.0|I get that it is difficult to raise a child in a same sex inviroment. What I don't get from this is that it seems as if the message is that \\"evil heterosexual sperm donor dad is evil\\". Seriously, wtf? They cast the guy as a \\"male slut\\" or something because he is having consensual sex with a black woman.... \\"he's a slut but at least he is not rascist???\\" Most retarded premise ever..... ever! Then a biological child finds out that they are his donation (world's worst sperm bank ever) and the guy steps up as a dad (like super fast). But I don't want to ruin the rest of this sexist movie.... oh wait, I do! So dad ( who happens to be a seriously awesome guy) finds out that he is a dad and he falls into love/emotion with one of the \\"mothers\\" and has nom noms with her. Well let me tell you the moral that I got from this. If you are a somewhat decent guy who is kinda of successful and you find out that you have kids that looked you up because of a sperm bank that (sereiously needs to be sued) let them know and then you go out of your way to be a great person to them but it causes problems in a relationship between a gay couple (it is the premise, so back off haters) and fall in love with one of the {mom's), said so called \\"father\\" is a horrible person who should be thrown away and ignored. Honestly, the most sexist movie I have EVER seen.
B003L77GRO|5.0|OMG.  What a great TV show.  I know it's not everyones cup of tea and still a great story.  Whenever I get through the DVD's, I am depressed because I know I'll have to wait another year to get the new one.  Delivery took a while cause it was preordered but arrived just when they said it would and at a lower cost to boot.  Thank you so much.  Can't wait for Season 6.
B0041KKYD8|5.0|\\"I Spit On Your Grave\\" is the ultimate in revenge horror. I don't want to give anything away but I do want to articulate that it had some really creative scenes. The first 50-60 minutes includes some very vile and graphic depictions of degradation which was disturbing especially for a first time viewer because you had no idea what was going on. But you will be rooting for the main protagonist as the movie progresses. Sarah Butler gave an utterly believable performance because her emotions ran the gamut of a to z. And I am quite certain she would have been nominated for the AA if the academy didn't look the other way as far as horror is concerned. Sometimes justice serves those that serve themselves, though.
B000AM2L1O|2.0|The doll I received is not nearly as lovely as the photo.  The picture shows a beautiful soft faced girly dolls.  Mine wasn't nearly as soft and sweet looking and had two painted on front teeth!  They look horrid.  Why oh why would they produce a newborn baby with teeth?  The vanilla scent was there but again not as yummy as other reviewers had found it to be.  We have a Melissa & Doug 12\\" Jenna dolly and she is so much sweeter looking that this Calin doll.  Everyone said to me look at Carolle for your daughters first baby as they are a wonderful but sadly this model is not.  I have purchased many of their dolls clothes (as they fit the Melissa and Dough doll beautifully) and have been extremely happy with them in terms of quality and aesthetics.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I enjoyed this book a lot. It combined history with the supernatural in a web of mystery without losing the reader in the storyline. I kept wanting more and found myself actually talking to/warning the characters. Like a good movie, you will get involved with the characters. They are well developed and \\"real.\\"  I can't wait for the next one.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I am ADDICTED and so is my husband (to \\"Breaking Bad\\", not meth). This show is so well written and such a nail-biter that we sit like starving squirrels nervously stuffing our faces while the hour's story unravels. It's terrible! But so much fun! We couldn't believe Walt was actually Bryan Cranston from \\"Malcom in the Middle\\". Sheesh -- talk about flabbergasting. Cranston has an incredible range and is a stunningly impressive actor. My mom is a librarian and says these DVDs fly off the shelves at work. Sadly, my husband and I have this theory that when we like a show it's sure to go off the air. Gosh I hope not ...  Start watching this folks! It's spectacular!
B0000024Q8|4.0|Terry Riley's In C is, if nothing else, one of the most epoch-making works of the twentieth century - whether it solehandedly instigated minimalism is a slightly different matter, but at least it changed the face of the musical world. It dates from 1964 and consists of 53 thematic patterns played in sequence; in unison or other alignment. The number of performers is optional, breaks for individual players are allowed, and the individual players themselves decide how many times to repeat a pattern. This, of course, means that every performance will give us a different resulting piece (and it sometimes feels wrong to play the same recording of it twice) - the sequence is specified, but the effect is that the tapestry of sound unfold differently, melding differently from one pattern to the other in a different manner, in each performance (in addition to the fact that different selections of instruments will, of course, create different textures).     The recording at hand is the work's world premiere recording from 1968, duly remastered. I guess there is no real point in comparing it with other performances except in overall character. In that respect this Buffalo performance is strikingly craggy and confrontational, probably due to the central use of wind instruments, though I am not sure I think of that as a positive or negative thing - it makes the music slightly harder on the ear, and could perhaps be a reason to choose a different recording as one's first encounter with the work. Another notable feature of this performance is the notable increase in speed approximately halfway through which interrupts the meditative, mesmerizing quality of the work with a sudden surge of urgency. The remastered sound is fine. I still cannot shake the feeling that detachedly listening to this essentially performers' music is somewhat misunderstanding the point (at least listening to it repeatedly), but the end result is nevertheless strikingly compelling.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Even as the endless debate rages on about the new (bad) changes made to the original films, there is an issue that troubles me far more; Why does the video suffer from over-saturated colors and crushed black levels and why does the new audio mix fail to correct existing issues that were known about since LFL first retouched them for the '97 re-release?    It seems as though LFL with all their resources cannot manage to recognize and fix simple errors that they themselves created. These include inconsistent lightsaber colors, loss of detail in the blacks,and audio issues like the left and right channels flipping around and not having the music, FX, dialogue, etc. at the proper levels. There were mistakes made in these areas when the films were retouched for their '97 theater release and again for their 2004 DVD release. Officially involved members of the team who worked on this new bluray release have gone on record assuring fans the issues have been corrected, yet here they are in the bluray.     All in all the product is not what was promised. Full of new special effects and added scenes, yes. Full of new technical problems and controversial editing, yes.    I give this one a failing grade and I hope the artists who worked on it are ashamed of themselves.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|I was already very much on the fence about picking this up as I was quite interested in the new supplemental material, but was upset that the original versions of the original trilogy were not included, only the special editions of episodes IV to VI. Now word comes that Lucas has made even more changes to the OT, changing Obi-wan's call to frighten the sand people (for some inexplicable reason) and adding blinking effects to the ewok's eyes. Those are minor and by themselves wouldn't bother me too much, but he also just HAD to add a reprise to the \\"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\\" from the end of the Revenge of the Sith by having Vader yell \\"NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\\" while the Emperor electrocutes Luke at the end of Return of the Jedi.  Lucas' obsessive need to tinker with the OT is either some kind of sickness or he is doing it to stick it to those who would dare prefer the \\"imperfect\\" OOT.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I would not normally do this, but enough is enough. I've been a supporter for years and defender of the multiple changes to the series. Some have upset me, like digitally throwing Hayden Christensen haphazardly into the end of Return of the Jedi or Luke screaming as he falls down the chute in Empire Strikes Back.     I wasn't even annoyed that much by Greedo shooting first or the horrible dance sequence in Jabba's Palace. But this is my last straw. When is well enough good enough. The scene where Vader kills the Emperor were pitch perfect and now all is ruined for the sake of throwing some poorly delivered lines into the mix. It even kills the fantastic music that John Williams created years ago by mucking it up with garbled yelling.     Ewoks blinking is cool and fine. I'll even accept Obi Wan sounding like a Bruce Lee wannabe when scaring away Tusken Raiders, but this is final scene is unacceptable. When is good enough going to be enough for these movies. All I wanted want a Blu Ray of what I've seen and enjoyed in the past. Instead, I have to get something I won't even waste my money on.     Congrats on losing my business.
0439023521|4.0|I have decided my reviews are going to be more about my opinion of the book than a synopsis of the storyline itself. If you need a general overview of the storyline there are countless other reviews you can read that will tell you all you need to know, and more.  So many reviews give so much away.  These kinds of reviews spoil my reading experience. When I read a review what I am looking for is an assessment and how the book affected the reader. Basically, I am trying to make my review what I look for in a review.     Initially, I was going to give The Hunger Games three stars, not because I did not enjoy it, but because when I first began reading I found the writing style to be a little simplistic.  A deep story, but a shallow way of telling it.  I have read books written for a younger audience before that I have completely enjoyed as an adult, and have found the writing to be perfectly mature. I don't think teen books need to be, or even should be, simplistic in style. The first chapter or two did not immediately grab me, the premise of the story, yes, but not the writing. I decided, however, as the book progressed, that the writing did also.      One example is When Peeta told Haymitch that Katniss did not understand the effect she could have on people and Katniss was offended, she thought she was being insulted.  My reaction was \\"oh come on\\" that is such an obvious and easy route to take, but in reality most teen girls are going to at least wonder if there might be a compliment in there, somewhere, I think.  Later in the day Katniss did indeed wonder just that.  This started happening more and more, my initial and immediate frustration with a certain situation would dissipate after I continued reading. The characters and situations become less one dimensional.    I found The Hunger Games to be like better reality television, even though the subject matter is extremely intense and thought provoking to my mind it is also at least somewhat of a fluffy read.  That may sound odd, to call a book set in such a torturous, difficult and unjust world fluffy, but it does lack just a little seriousness. I don't read much fantasy fiction at all, and to be honest it is not my thing, so I concede that I might be judging this aspect of the book a little harshly, and not giving the fantasy aspects of the storyline credibility they may well deserve.  It is possible I would consider the book to be more serious if there were no people in the future dyed green or sprayed sparkly. The purple and plucked people are not keeping me away from the sequel though, that is for sure! Like better reality tv I found the story undeniably entertaining. It seems I have become hooked on this barbaric fluff! My first thought after I finished reading last night was that I absolutely must know what happens next! I am giving the book four stars, because as my review title suggests I am going to the store to purchase the second book in the series TODAY. I don't think I will ever consider the Hunger Games to be a great book, but it absolutely is addictive and the characters became compelling!
0553381695|2.0|Great book but not what i thought i ordered.  I ended up paying more for the book than i would in the store.  I tried to get help from bookworm but they never followed up.  I will not order from them again!

B003ZSJ212|1.0|Adding to the chorus of 'boos,' I am a strong example of a \\"woman (Star) warrior.\\" I am, unfortunately, old enough to remember going to see every single Star Wars film in cinemas. Not to wax too nostalgic, but as a young(er) lady in 1977, I was swooning to the sight of stud Harrison Ford and \\"young turk\\" Mark Hamill - all while downing a popcorn (with real butter) and an ice-cold Royal Crown cola. I saw the original Star Wars in cinemas at least two dozen times, Empire about a dozen times, and Jedi about half a dozen. Why the decline? I got busier with my artist management and simply couldn't attend cinema as much as before.    As for the Blu-ray set, somebody should tell Lucas to go jump in a bacta tank. He first trashed the films in 1997 when he plastered cinema screens with pure excrement called the \\"Special Editions.\\" Then he further degraded the trilogy with a whole new set of changes (on top of the '97 changes) for the 2004 DVDs. Now he has applied additional changes on top of the '04 and '97 changes.     At least when Lucas' friend (and far superior filmmaker) Steven Spielberg made egregious alterations to his classic \\"E.T.\\" he insisted that the original version be issued as well. Because not only does Spielberg respect the need to preserve films as they were originally released, he also respects his fans' wishes. I mean, just look at \\"Close Encounters\\" - the Blu-ray gives us all three separate cuts of the film (including the only one that counts: the theatrical cut).      But Lucas is like someone obsessed with plastic surgery. Once the process of change begins, a person can lose sight and overdo the nipping and tucking (trust me, I've had a few weak-willed friends who \\"gave in\\" to societal expectations of female so-called beauty). So yes, Vader crying out \\"NOOOOO!\\" is a horrible idea (and an unnecessary \\"link\\" to Episode III).  But it really doesn't matter anymore what he does. The damage is done. It's irreparable. And I, for one, prefer to reminisce aboutmy cold RC and sticky theater floors while watching superstuds like Harrison Ford and Billy Dee Williams making my heart flutter.    One more thought: are these versions acceptable for new, young fans who are just discovering the \\"Moldy Saga\\"? No, because these movies are garbage at this point. Get the DVDs with the original versions - kids don't care how \\"perfect\\" the special effects are. They respond to the stories and the characters. Hey, when I was a youngster we had sci-fi movies with flying saucers hanging off visible strings or wires. But a good story is a good story. \\"Star Wars\\" used to be that - all that is left is pure stench because Lucas rotted them.
B000V86OKG|5.0|you must see the first season first but if your into drama and suspense this show is for you.  it will keep you on the edge of your seat and you will be attached to your t.v. until you finish the season
B003ZSJ212|1.0|If you buy this box set, you'll only financially validate and support George Lucas' tampering and desecration of the Star Wars saga. Two of the films in the original trilogy weren't even directed by him, yet he goes back and alters other directors' visions.
B005COO1X6|5.0|If you enjoyed Christine, you will definitely love Mile 81, as you will see that Mile 81 could be one of the places that Christine would have called home. But I will focus on the pure rush of adrenaline and terror that you will feel from the Mile.<br /><br /> Once the horror of the Mile pulls you in, you will not be able to leave this stretch of highway until the ride is over. The characters are fully sketched out and are very believable and you are made to care about them and hence to fear for their lives in typical King fashion (in which nothing is typical).<br /><br /> But you fear that no one will be able to make it out alive on this ride and you hold your breath for the characters who you hope just might make it and you are not able to let go. You hold onto that bar that is supposed to keep you safe on the ride and it seems dangerously loose.<br /><br /> The \\"safety\\" bar will keep slipping open, leaving you flirting with death. You definitely are kept on a hairline edge between life and death and just when you think you are home free, the safety bar will be wildly torn completely off.<br /><br />It is as if it is your life on the line or your best friends', your loved ones,  or your children's lives. The ones you hold most dear. These characters will stay with you.<br /><br />Some of it is told in that way I love (and fear) when you know something is way off and something is going to happen that will terrify you, have no doubts about it. That adds more layers to the tension as you don't know if anyone will come out alive and you hope against hope that they will. And that at least some of the characters will come through for each other.<br /><br />There is amusing humor dispersed throughout but you will still feel the complete rush of the spine-tingling chills and nail-biting panic (make that the-complete-ripping-off-of-the-entire-nail-and putting needles-in-your-cuticles-type of panic).<br /><br />There is no way to fully describe the deliciously dreadful state of mind you will be in- so all I can say is get off the highway now, don't wait any longer and don't let the fear deter you! I can only say that I hope you survive it. This is not for the weak of heart and even people used to King's rides of terror will still have their breath taken away on this one.<br /><br />I didn't know if I could keep holding on as it really whips you around and I was holding on so tight that I was numb from the apprehension. (If being numb from horror is possible?) But of course I had to keep going and find out what was ahead for the characters.<br /><br />I am glad that I documented my reaction as I read  Mile 81 and so I will leave you with that to give you just a taste and hopefully you are not pushed too far over the edge of the divider. I wouldn't want you getting stuck at Mile 81, now would I?<br /><br />(Note:  The following quotes are my live reaction from reading Mile 81, but may be slightly changed from the original twitter version posted, so that you can get the full idea.)<br /><br /> \\"White knuckles, tense, holding my breath.\\"<br /><br />\\"Heart racing, chills down my spine, have to read on, but I'm so scared for them, I don't know if I can face the horror and what is going to happen.\\"<br /><br />\\"Eyes scrunched tight, want to hide under the table, but won't be safe there either!\\"<br /><br />Quote from Stephen King's Mile 81: \\"Had to fight every instinct in my brain and my body to keep from running.\\" My version- \\"HAD TO FIGHT every instinct to keep from dropping the book and running away in terror, but could not STOP reading!\\"<br /><br />Check out my blog for the full version- bookwormcastle at wordpress<br /><br />Follow me @Bookwormcastle on twitter for more Stephen King and exciting readshighway now, don't wait any longer and don't let the fear deter you!

B003ZSJ212|1.0|While Lucas and his wacky crew were busy pasting in new \\"Nooooo!'s\\" and extra rocks in front of R2D2 (how'd he get back there, anyway?!), they must have forgotten to fix all of the lightsaber color errors created in the 2004 DVD's.  Oh wait.....they said they did?    Two shots.  Those are the only ones they fixed.  Just the two shots they used in the press release........um.........WHY?  People on YOUTUBE make consistent lightsaber effects.  Jeesh.    Not to mention that this still has all the bad color-timing (blue Hoth) that they did for the DVD's.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Enough is enough, the new changes to the original Star Wars films (IV to VI) are the final straw.  Lucas can tinker with his films as much as he wants as long as he releases the original theatrical versions cleaned up and remastered for blu ray.  To deny the public that made him a billionaire the theatrical versions is hubris of the worst kind.  I won't be buying this product.
B003UMW68Y|5.0|The first time I watched it on Blu-Ray, I found it to be great. The day after that, I showed the product to my sister and she acted excited because its her most favorite movie since 2005 and we saw it together the following night. The picture is WAY MORE superior than the Blu-Ray of \\"James and the Giant Peach\\". This includes the DVD so you can get a better deal at it. Check it out and enjoy yourself.  :)
B00004SZWD|4.0|This is an awesmome CD and it was mainly just an upgrade for me from vinly/cassette to CD. I have a lot of Stevie's CD's, but had not upgraded this one, and so it is so amazing to add it to my CD collection. Thank you for the opportunity to express how awesome Stevie's work is and the delivery time was great also.
B000002KIE|3.0|Let me try to explain my original review:  I went overboard to make a point.  This album is not that bad, but my point is this - there were quite a few other punk, and pre-punk bands, that existed the same time (and before) the Sex Pistols, that were actually BETTER than the Pistols.  If you love this kind of music (like I do), you really should check out at least some of the following, and decide for yourself:  The Saints (\\"Eternally Yours\\" and \\"Stranded\\"), The New Yark Dolls (their first album), Richard Hell and the Voidoids, Television, X, The Germs, Electric Eels, the Dead Boys (first album), Mars, and Iggy & The Stooges' \\"Funhouse\\".  And please, have an open mind when you do so.  If you love music, you owe this to yourself.  That's all!  Original Review:  One of the worst, and most over-rated albums ever.  C'mon!!  EMI told these losers how to dress, what to say, how to play, etc.  This is *not* true punk rock folks.  This is record company-created, processed crappola.  The only Pistol who had any talent at all, Johnny Lydon, went on to produce GREAT music with PIL.  Sex Pistols are a perfect (horrible) example of a corporation manipilating a stupid, cattle-like public into \\"loving\\" an inferior product.  (Bud Lite, anyone?  And hey, how 'bout those Super Bowl ads, hey?)  C'mon people, God (or someone) gave you a brain - USE IT - OK??
1593080409|5.0|I love Sherlock Holmes stories and had recently purchased The Complete Sherlock Holmes Volume I which I read.  I wanted Volume II and I knew that I could find it on Amazon.com.  It is well written with lots of historical information and biographical information about the author.  A good book to take with you when you know you will be waiting a while, lots of short stories.  I enjoyed this book very much and will keep it in my collection. If you like puzzles you will like these stories.
092389165X|4.0|Hiroshima is a detailed account of the events of the blast from the perspective of those who survived it. Although a bit confusing at the beginning as it introduces the six subjects in rapid succession, it held my attention reasonably well. The journalist/author does a great job in conveying the confusion, horror and lack of understanding that encompassed the event. Don't expect to draw any moral conclusions about the use of nuclear weapons from this book as it is a complicated moral issue, this book is simply a well written engrossing account of the events of the Hiroshima bomb from those who were most effected.
1603425381|5.0|I love this book! the borders are easy & beautiful, color suggestion is great. I will use this to add some new borders to some of my project that I aready made to spruce them up.
6302206294|5.0|Holy cow! What a great movie! I am crazy nutty over this I love it. My friend came over and brought this movie with her, I could tell I was going to like it from the opening credits. And she forgot and left it at my house and I just dont have the heart to give it back lol. Everything about this film is perfect to me. Kevin Costner as Robin Hood, you cant do any better then that. It has a few really really funny lines in it that is priceless and unforgetable. Its just so awesome, cant be beat.
B004ZGI2KK|2.0|Hmm... this movie was really quite awful... yet, as a total, unabashed paranormal romance junkie, I found myself a little bit... fascinated as it went on. And I think I know why: I have never seen a movie get SOOOO much RIGHT, all to wind up sabotaging the good stuff with what it got so very, VERY wrong. I wound up so detached, I felt like a true, objective movie critic. I didn't really FEEL anything, but I was able to analyze it as an artist, an entertainer and a writer. Almost like stepping outside of yourself and watching a movie through another person's eyes.<br /><br />I think if you just LOVE dark paranormal romance - can't get enough of it, and are highly addicted to the genre - you may like this enough to be satisfied like a junk food junkie regretting your latest Cheetos binge. I personally was not satisfied even to that degree... but for what it's worth, here's what I noted to be right, wrong and somewhere in-between:<br /><br />-The historical setting was a nice change of scenery for a YA paranormal romance, but ruined by everyone speaking in too contemporary a fashion.<br /><br />-The heroine was strong in theory, but I barely even remember what she looked like. And by the way, did the name Valerie even exist in medieval-ish times? Not bloody likely.<br /><br />-Billy Burke, aka \\"Charlie\\" from [[ASIN:B001UV4XFG The Twilight Saga]] is a terrific actor, but his character was written so... so... silly. As a matter of fact, this cast was quite impressive: you've got Gary Oldman, Julie Christie, Virginia Madsen... and not a one of them could do a damn thing to make their characters remotely sane or likable. They were all just so... goofy... and not in a fun way. Just... over the top and bizarre and unsympathetic.<br /><br />The one thing about this movie that had no redeeming qualities whatsoever was the horrific music [soundtrack and score]. \\"They\\" were trying to go for the [[ASIN:6305746605 Plunkett & Macleane]] or [[ASIN:B00000F4ZY A Knight's Tale]] aesthetic: contemporary music in a historical setting. Perfectly done in those two movies. In this? It just felt like I was constantly being shouted at, or like my head was shoved into a huge, metal mixing bowl while the animal-costumed villagers in [[ASIN:B00005KHJR The Wicker Man]] merrily gong-banged it with meat mallets.<br /><br />The only true \\"win\\" in this movie was actor Shiloh Fernandez as \\"Peter.\\" [Yes, like the fable, \\"Peter and the Wolf.\\" Hint or red herring? Such clever writers, eh? Tee-hee!] I fell in love with this actor in the epic mind-frak of an indie zombie film called [[ASIN:B002EOVXBK Deadgirl]]. [Which, by the way, I do NOT recommend at ALL for horror movie light-weights]. Shiloh is like a mix of Joaquin Phoenix [pre-crazy] and Johnny Depp. Need I say more? I just hope this movie hasn't ruined his career!<br /><br />Finally, \\"The Hood\\" did deliver at least a few of the trailer's promises: the cinematography, costumes, locations and sets were almost as drool-worthy as the dark hero. Unfortunately, all the physical beauty in the world could not save this beast. Had [[ASIN:B003Y5H556 Red Riding Hood]] been YA-soap-opera-campy, I would at least have had a little fun.

B00004RFFI|5.0|I loooove this movie! I watched it the other night with the stereo blasted, AWESOME!!!! By the way, who else is a fan of thier big red dodge truck? watching this movie, you feel like your really there in the middle of a tornado. (Trust me I know whats its like) Whats wierd is that once I watched it and that very night a REAl tornado went thru our back yard! Now that was scary. I thought we was going to get blown off the map lol. My point is that this movie is eerie and creepy enough to make you feel like its real. So anyway, Its a great movie.
0553801473|3.0|I'm not sure why, but I thought Book 5 was the end of the Series.  Unfortunately, when you start off thinking that, you keep wondering when the story is going to tie up the loose end, only to realize it DOESN'T!  My own fault I guess, but not my favorite book in the Series.  I'm not sure it added all that much value to the story line; if it did, I missed it!
0553801473|1.0|If you are new to this series, a word of advice, read the first three and stop. That is where the story really ends, after that the genius dies, the author is hopelessly lot in the morass, and the readers and characters all get sucked down with him.<br /><br />After the first three books,everyone gradually develops a collective amnesia. They forget their own characters along with just about everything else that ever made them real or interesting. At some point in their past, they may have been motivated to seek a goal, but what it was, why they wanted it, how they were going to attain it, that has all long been lost. Instead they now wander around forever in their own little circles, bogging further and further down with each step. Probably their weariness came from having to endure hearing the entire life story and food preferences of every bit player they encounter in the story. No wait, that was me!<br /><br />I feel so sad writing this, because I absolutely loved George Martin's writing when i first discovered him, the \\"Aces\\" series, Fevre Dream, the first three books in the \\"Thrones\\", i devoured them and counted the days when there would be more. When \\"Feast\\" turned out to be rubbish, I thought it an aberration, I was more than ready to forgive. I believed his explanation, he had so much to say that it was hard to move it all forward. Now that I have read \\"Dance\\", I see it is actually the opposite, he has so little to say that he is compelled to add story after story and worthless detail after worthless detail in a vain attempt to find him way back. But with \\"Dance\\" I have to conclude, he is lost, the characters are lost and reading more is just trampling on their corpses.<br /><br />I wanted to settle in for a good long read, to savour each line and lose myself in his world, but 1000 pages of nothing was not worth the time lost out of my life. There was one momentary flash of the old storyteller, the section describing the greenseers brought hope back for a moment, but it was not to be, maybe someone else wrote that part for him. Quickly following were jarring contemporary references and constant resorts to laughably vulgar writing. This book is nowhere near Tolkien's league,  Harold Robbins and Sidney Sheldon, though, now that is the right company.ment, but it was not to be, maybe someone else wrote that part for him.

B00003CX9E|5.0|I always wanted a copy of this classic movie.  It also included another disc telling about the making of the movie.  The quality of this old black and white film was great and I'll watch it many times in the years to come.  I also enjoyed the color disc that was more current.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I was going to buy the Star Wars Saga on Blu-ray and was actually extremely excited to do so, that is until I saw the NEW changes made to the originals. I can't watch the end of Episode VI with Darth Vader screaming \\"NOOOOooooo!!\\" I REFUSE to do so. Thanks for the memories George.
B00402FGEE|2.0|I've heard that the studio was going for a \\"Battlestar Galactica feel\\" with this.  Although clearly the idea was taken from Star Trek Voyager.      Pros:   - The cgi detail is good, the Destiny exterior is incredibly detailed,   - The music attempts to be in line with the style of BSG, so can be compelling and simplistic   - About three good actors in the show.    Cons:   - About 30 seconds of space battles in the whole season. Battlestar Galactica has a huge space battle in its first episode for a reason, to keep people interested.   - And where two ships are firing at each other, a huge effort goes into making sure the ships aren't in the same frame. Which was acceptable in the 60's with the original Star Trek. But now it is possible to have more then one ship on screen at a time.   - Also the enemy sucks, there ships look like cargo haulers containing circle shaped \\"fighters\\" and the decision to make them cgi guarantees there are barely in the show as they are too expensive.   - Our heroes have no control over their destiny, which gets old fast.   - The cast aren't that interesting, Rush, Young and Wallace are compelling, the rest have their moments but it wouldn't have bothered me if two thirds of the cast were just killed outright.   - The cast are barely likeable.   - Almost no humour, Jack O Neill was brilliant at adding humour to a great show. Here there is none and it really suffers for it.   - Theres no bridge, instead we have the equivalent of a big closet with some keyboards and corridors leading to it.   - At times its just outright boring.     What BSG had that this doesn't   - A compelling enemy we get to see alot of.   - An extraordinary cast with great character.   - Proper space battles.   - Mystery beyond \\"are we there yet\\".      Also, I haven't seen season two yet, but it wouldn't matter if season two was a proper return to SG1 or Atlantis form.    Season 1 answers an old question. Was it possible for Battlestar Galactica to be much worse?   Godsyes.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I thought I was impressed with my BK9 but let me tell you that this BK2 could be the only blade you would need should you be stranded in the wilds! It is one beefy blade, about 1/4\\" thick, 5.5\\" blade which is as sharp as you would want it to be. I can see this particular blade wearing many different hats, batonning,chopping,cutting,cleaning game, personal defense and many more! I even tried peeling an apple a little while ago, was not perfect but it did it ok. The sheath is also well made and can be configured for those lefties among us, the only issue that I do have is that the sheath is quite reluctant to release the blade, I am not a small man but I have to give it a hearty pull to get blade out, a bit annoying but that's it. I am now conflicted as to which knife I like the best, the BK9 or the BK2???? Well, for now I guess they will both accompany me when going out in the wilderness!
B001TW68HC|5.0|Within the Realm of the Dying Sun is the third release by Dead Can Dance and one of their very best efforts.  It was released in 1987 and follows another excellent album of their's, 1986's Spleen and Ideal (also recommended).  A somewhat somber effort by Dead Can Dance, it is almost symphonic at times in its use of percussion and brass.  The album is divided into first Brendan Perry's songs which are followed by Lisa Gerrard's beautiful vocalizations.    Definitely one of Dead Can Dance's best efforts and should be part of any fan's collection.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I'm really in love with this album, Adele did such an amazing job!  It is very soulful, but yet still moves along quite nicely.  My favorite songs on the album are \\"Someone Like You\\", \\"Turning Tables\\", and \\"Take it All\\".  These songs are so comforting and emotional, they are played on repeat in my car haha.  I'm also in love with the music video she made in her home for \\"Someone Like You\\", her interview almost made me cry (and I'm not single), and her accent is adorable!  I also love that she's not a sellout, but stays true to herself.  This is defnitely one of those albums worth purchasing the entire album for, not just 1 or 2 songs.  Adele makes beautiful music, I can't wait to see what else she comes out with for a \\"23\\" album!  YOU ROCK ADELE!!
B005COO1X6|4.0|Old fashioned fun horror. Only the kids are dumb enough to believe and survive. King at his best, lean, direct and smart. Always a useful commentary on the present. Keep writing.
0756405890|5.0|Gripping. Great story AND great writing. As page-turning as Game of Thrones but totally opposite style - rather than massive cast, all focus is on one character's journey. Unique style of that character telling the story of his life for 99% of the book - very little happens in the \\"present\\", but what does happen foreshadows excitement to come. Couldn't wait for the next one in paperback so I bought on Kindle.
B0058A11AK|2.0|This CD is just a total rip off, and I agree that the positive reviews and over the top adulation are just postings from company employees, who she probably DEMANDED they kneel at her feet.    As for releasing a deluxe CD with previously released songs, you can burn your own Cd from your own CD's and make your own deluxe CD !.    Hasn't she ripped off the fans enough over the decades ?. Why do people still buy ANYTHING she puts out. It's just pure money hungry greed on her behalf.    Her voice is raspy and the album is the same track after track. I would have preferred more Broadway show tunes and some big belted out numbers, but she is just lazy and money hungry. Don't waste your money, listen to it on YouTube for free.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|I was excited to see the original (and best) Star Wars films make it to Blu-Ray. I made a pre-order. I thought about how awesome \\"Empire\\" would look in 1080p.    Then I saw the clip of Darth Vader saying, \\"Nooooooooo!\\" like a drama mama, new for this release of The Return of the Jedi. A great scene totally ruined because George Lucas can't leave even anything alone. You wouldn't catch Peter Jackson doing this.    I've canceled my order. With apologies to Amazon, I can't buy movies that have been ruined by the filmmaker.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Years ago, George Lucas spoke out against filmmakers changing their art, going so far as to call it \\"barbaric.\\" Well, years later, George has become the greatest offender of ruining art. True fans of Star Wars will ignore these Blu Rays until they are changed back to their original form.
1594744769|5.0|I have fallen head over heels for my Kindle, but this is a book I purchased.  You have to be able to flip back and forth to the pictures because they do enhance the story.  Wonderful story and great twists and turns.
0452286751|3.0|A while ago, Sarah Palin and her band of tea party protesters started mentioning \\"going Galt\\" (a reference to Rand's book Atlas Shrugged) in their protest signs.. I don't think I need to explain how eye-roll worthy the idea was of Palin ceasing productive activity leading to society falling apart. (In Atlas Shrugged, John Galt organizes a creative strike of genius individuals which results in society's collapse, so that these geniuses can be free to carry out their ideas the way they want). This primed me to hate Ayn Rand, her philosophy, and body of work. I was as annoyed as I thought I'd be when I started reading, but as silly as her caricature characters and their drawn out repetitive speeches were, I still found myself thinking about this book a great deal.     I think to get something out of this book without getting extremely annoyed or overzealous, you need to have an understanding of Ayn Rand in the back of your mind as opposed to taking the work completely on its own. This is a very emotionally written book; as much contempt as Rand might have for emotion, someone doesn't get this dogmatic and rigid without having an emotional reason for it... it's not rational! (Sorry Ayn) As another reviewer pointed out, her family fled Russia after the Bolshevik revolution, and they fell into terrible living conditions due to the communist overtake. After coming to the States she found success after some hard work, its no wonder she hated communism and respected capitalism. Not sure where her violent sexual fantasies come from but I'm sure there's something behind that too..     There are some very irritating flaws that I need to vent about before I can go on. She seriously needed to learn more about architecture. So many of her descriptions were just calling buildings brilliant, clean, and rational and telling us to take her word for it. Could she not open a freaking book on architecture? What really bothers me about this is that she doesn't allow the reader to form their own opinion on these buildings, but to accept that this pinnacle of modern architectural achievement exists and that Roark was the one to bring it to life (hypocrite!). So basically Ayn couldn't actually fathom these buildings to describe them, so we must accept that they are so awesome. Not impressed Ayn, but ok, architecture is a metaphor and not your point, fine. Whatever.     Story-wise, I don't see what the point is in her characters being so absurdly tunnel visioned except that perhaps it reflects her own refusal to more fully understand people she disagrees with, or even agrees with. Out of any protagonist I've read, Roark grows such an incredibly little amount. He is perfect (by the way he is not perfect), therefore must not be questioned. Again perfection cannot really be fathomed by Ayn so he is not given much dialogue, and we're not able to get inside his head and empathize with him. He is a hero to be worshiped by the readers. Rand herself has said however, that she creates her characters this way intentionally so that they are almost purely vehicles for her philosophy as opposed to believable people. Thus explaining why Roark seems more like a sociopath than the ideal man.     A bigger problem that sticks out to me is how easily this philosophy can become hypocritical for people who buy into it. It is so easy to think of oneself as a misunderstood genius and to shun away people that disagree, but real people are not infallible. They have to be able to take constructive criticism so that they can improve. When someone isn't able to grow, we get the ugly Grecian buildings in this book that symbolize mediocrity (can't imagine what Roark's response to post-modernism would be). I mean, Sarah Palin is the shining beacon of mediocrity in America and if she can use Rand's philosophy to justify her beliefs then I am scared. I personally was very individualistic till I saw how problematic it is when taken to Rand's extreme. This level of egoism will prevent one from making positive change, even if they have something of value to contribute.     So. Let us take a few steps back and reflect on the good. The individual is a wonderful thing, and people should strive for greatness and to be as un-compromised as possible. Nietzsche does a much better job of explaining this I think (though he's just as sexist) and also is adamant in pointing out that people must constantly question, and struggle, so that they can grow. I'm pretty sure he'd refer to Roark as an inverse cripple, people who have too much of one thing and too little of everything else, and are called great by the people around them. Dominique thinks society is the reason Roark can't reach his full potential, but that is just an excuse for Roark to not truly self actualize by achieving well rounded perfection. Reason is also a wonderful thing, the most wonderful thing. But reason without humanity is really boring (as evidenced by brutalist architecture). All in all, this book made me stay up and write a long review on the points I've been obsessing over, meaning it made me think. And what is more important in a book than that? It has its merits, could have been better, and is abrasive enough to force one to formulate their thoughts on what exactly they love and hate and why.

B004T5R2HQ|5.0|I am picking up that some g2 users are having troubles getting CamScanner Free to work. That is not the case with me. Maybe the version on Amazon is somehow different than the one on the Market? I am not sure. I will say this: I have used both the free version of CamScanner and I found it to be so useful, that I bought the full version. Certainly by now it has paid for itself. for example, at the courthouse, I needed a copy of a document, and they wanted to charge me for the copy... No Need! I just whipped out CamScanner and bam! Also, this other time I was designing a book... I wanted to scan some artwork from this old original book, but it was too fragile to place on a flatbed scanner... bam! CamScanner to the rescue! I have used it for creative projects, situations in which I wanted to keep a copy of the document I signed but couldn't keep for some reason.. and many other things. all this on my G2.
B004T5R2HQ|5.0|It's amazing how useful this thing is... I use it even for business. Scan a signed contract,  a document on the fly... It's great!
B004A8ZX28|2.0|First, I really like Liam Neeson and wanted to love this movie. I didn't. It had serious pacing issues, to the point where a good 45 minutes could have been taken out of it. The acting was okay, and despite the amount of stars in this movie, there were more wooden scenes than interesting ones. This type of movie has been done better, and I won't mention by who in case you haven't seen it yet. If I tell you which movie takes the prize for this type of storyline, you'll instantly know \\"the secret\\" of the film. So I won't.<br /><br />My family, who usually loves a good action adventure, was bored with this one. I have to say, I was too.
B005KGPC4S|5.0|I saw this first at the Cobb Energy Center screening in Atlanta and loved it the first time. If you are not a Kevin Smith fan then that is ok (kinda) because this movie rocks. It is like nothing he has done before. It has the raunchiness of his films however, though the thriller aspect of the film is really where it stands apart. If you love indie-film then it is easy to get behind a film like this one. I only give it five stars because 6 stars is not an option. Seriously...pre-theatrical.....rent it.....or pre-order the blu-ray....just watch it.
B004SH40BQ|1.0|i bought this thing cause it said it would work with my ipod touch 4th gen. on the package however says it only works with 1st and 2nd gen ipod touch. if you say otherwise i hooked it up to my 3rd gen touch and it even said it didn't support it. so basically i just spent money something that is completely useless to me.
B004P4S4NM|4.0|Dispatched fast and I love it already. A few tracks are filler but you expect that on any album to be honest. Overall it's definitely worth buying.
0439023521|5.0|I recently finished all 3 books and have found myself still so connected to the story. After much pondering I have come to realize how much \\"The Hunger Games Trilogy\\" relates to living with cancer.     First of all,if given the choice I would have asked that it be me to carry this disease instead of someone in my family. And so it is.     Once you begin treatment you are definitely thrown into an arena of obstacles and hardships unfamilair to your life as it once was. Survival is your only focus now. Although cancer patients do not set out to kill each other, once you have developed a comradery with other  patients in the arena (chemo room)as the months pass some of them do not return. Reading their obituary is like The Capitol flashing their image in the sky. You live with the thought that you could be next, but then instinct takes over and your only thought is to fight like hell to stay alive one more day.    I related district 13 to that of the change in your life when you choose treatment in a clinical trial.....the treatments you became familiar with no longer exists and the latest technology is there for the taking. But no one knows what the long term affects are. Is this the answer? Or am I just being thrown into a different arena.     Many of the trials Katniss went thru forced her to maintain her sanity in order to survive. Anyone living with cancer has the realization that a horrible death sits in waiting. I now call these thoughts \\"brain mutts.\\" Some days they show no mercy and rip you apart thought after thought until you are so weak sleep comes from mental exhaustion.   Just like Katniss, I am forever more a changed being. Carrying scars way too deep to forget. And loving someone carries with it that same question. Is it real or not real?    September is National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month. Know the symptoms to keep you out of the arena.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Works great. I have downloaded a ton of videos for my Coby Kyros MID7024 for when I don't have Wi-Fi to hook to. I also have this all on my phone and never had any prob, have download tons of videos as well as mp3s on it as well.
B004SDSSFY|1.0|I should have read reviews first but I used the free version on another tablet and full editting worked.  I liked the product.  the version on my Acer did not allow editting, so when amazon put it out at half price I decided to buy it.  it would not install.  I have to assume this is because the yahoos at Acer bloated their tablet by including it in the rom.  thanks Acer.  first bad thing I have to say about your tablet.  the rom should be for the os not bloatwhere.<br /><br />I am still waiting on amazon to respond but if documents to go is pre installed on your device do not buy from amazon.  apparently your only choice is to buy direct at inflated price.  guess I will look for a better alternative.
0670022411|4.0|I enjoyed \\"A Discovery of Witches.\\" It was a fresh view point, and offered well rounded characters and an interesting plot line.   I would warn anyone reading the book that it is obviously the first in a new series, so they may want to hold off until the next book is published. Personally, I am eager to read more!  Were some things a bit too easily resolved? Sure. But it was an enjoyable read with some lovely romantic moments and thankfully the main character wasn't some lovesick teenager.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|\\"They're his movies....\\" blah blah blah.  My pre-order was based on what was advertised: the Star Wars Saga - NOT a \\"new version\\" of the Star Wars Saga.  The SE included many unnecessary changes that I could live with, but these changes are shoddy in their execution and reveal that Lucasfilms knows nothing about character arc, subtlety or quality.  Someone who works there needs to say 'no' to George.  I recently heard someone say Lucas added the \\"nooooo\\" because of his laughable \\"it's like poetry stanzas\\" excuse.  That would be like saying  \\"since I used the word 'night' at the end of the 3rd line, I need to make sure I use that same word at the end of line 6.\\"  Good poetry is not a sing-song rhyme.    I was looking forward to the archival discs, but there's no way I'm shelling out even $90 just to have those.    I'll Netflix those or wait til these are clearance-d somewhere.    If Lucas was DaVinci the Mona Lisa would now look like Lisa Simpson
B003ZSJ212|1.0|At some point George Lucas needs to decide that these movies are finished products and not something to be continuously tinkered with any chance he gets. These most recent changes only work to demonstrate how out of touch he is with directing and film making. With this he's taken what was a incredibly anticipated release and turned it into a PR nightmare and a huge disappointment that only continues to build resentment towards him and his \\"product.\\"
B004XJHBCE|5.0|I got my HTC Thunderbolt five months ago and have filled it since with a lot of apps. My tastes are rather eclectic so the apps cover a large range of genres: office, gps & maps, music, pictures, games, food & wine, and many more. So much so that it all got quite unusable - that is until I stumbled on FolderOrganizer. After downloading it I spent one afternoon organizing my mess and order emerged from chaos... great app! It should be part of the Android OS.
B005COO1X6|3.0|Stephen King's novelette, MILE 81 tells the story of an abandoned rest stop, or rather the peculiar car that chooses to park there, and what that car does when the curious get too close.<br /><br />Ten year old Pete Simmons, brushed off by his older brother and his gang and looking for something to do, decides to investigate a nearby rest area, which, once a popular stop for hungry and weary travelers on the I-95 stretch of highway, is now little more than a dilapidated hangout for local teens looking for somewhere safe to get high and get lucky. Once there, Pete finds a bottle of vodka and samples it, which proves enough to knock him out for a few hours. While he sleeps, a mud-coated Station Wagon \\"of indeterminate make and vintage\\" shows up and parks outside. The door swings open, and nobody steps out.<br /><br />I won't say much more about the plot, because the story is too short for that, something I wish the publishers had kept in mind when coming up with the sales copy. Because unfortunately, if you've read the synopsis of the book, you know 75% of the story already, which, like movie trailers that give away major plot points, is annoying. One could argue that the \\"deaths\\" were mentioned in the publisher's synopsis because there's a lot more to the story. The problem, though, is that there isn't. We get a nice setup, which reads like it would for a novel, in which Pete is introduced and sets off looking for mischief or adventure, whichever comes first. Then we get the car and the ensuing creepiness, and then (and this is my main beef with the story), we get a hurried, unsatisfying ending.<br /><br />Which is unfortunate, because for the majority of MILE 81, I felt like I was a teenager again, reading CHRISTINE for the first time. The style is vintage, good-old fashioned King, and MILE 81 will inevitably draw comparisons to that novel, although it probably has more in common with FROM A BUICK 8 (both feature cars with questionable appetites), with a dash of the slow, creeping death of \\"The Float\\" (from SKELETON CREW) thrown in for good measure. And as is typical of King's work, the characters are handled with the author's trademark skill. Within the space of a page, we know them, which makes us care about what happens to them. And while I had issues with some of the children's dialogue (both internal and external) not ringing true at times, I was willing to forgive it because in my experience, such minor issues are quickly forgotten in a King story by the time the real fun starts.<br /><br />But sadly, the fun is all too brief in MILE 81, and in the end I felt as if I had read the opening chapter to an abandoned novel, or perhaps a FROM A BUICK 8 prologue that was abandoned in favor of not making the car so obviously homicidal. There are some great scenes here (one involving a tire is delightfully creepy, and the death scenes are pretty clever), but while I agree with the author's contention that the novella is the perfect length for horror fiction (and FULL DARK, NO STARS is proof of his own mastery of that format), here it feels constricting, as if King had someone standing over his shoulder reminding him of the word count restrictions when he wanted to write a novel. It's jarring, because everything to that point promises more of a payoff, which doubles the let-down when it doesn't come.<br /><br />Still, I recommend reading it, particularly if, like me, anything King writes is an automatic purchase for you. You'll enjoy the ride, even if it doesn't handle as well as the overenthusiastic salesman promised, but when it stops abruptly enough to give you whiplash, don't say I didn't warn you.\\"The Float\\" (from SKELETON CREW) thrown in for good measure.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|I been waiting forever to buy the bluray edition but sadly changed my mind after seeing the throne room clip.    When I was a kid, I used to think he was a genius  but now I'm starting to think he just got lucky.  The first movie had a great story but also had a lot of cutting-edge special effects that really got people's attention.  Then he was fortunate enough to get good directors for the other two.  When he's in full control and able to express his ideas without any limitations, his stuff really isn't that good.  I do hope he stops his constant fiddling with these movies.  I fear that his next change will have Darth Vader saying \\"No, I am your father\\" followed by him whipping off his helmet to reveal Howard the Duck.

B003L77G6A|5.0|By far the best show, can't wait for season 5. Yes, season 4 took a different direction, but I don't think it harmed the show in any way, it is still nerdy and lovable. Plus, the season finale really ended with a bang!
B004US4K2C|5.0|great themes, great visual options, fluid transitions, built-in task killer, amazing folder options (in the app drawer and home screen). one of the many who wants a fully customized home replacement. Go Launcher EX is the best. Updates have made it from great to phenomenal!!!! If you want to make your Android device you from top to bottom look no further.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|I purchased the Fiio e5 headphone amplifier for use with my Sennheiser HD-201s. For that purpose, it is excellent. The audio spectrum of the 201s lend themselves to monitoring, with an overall flat response. In addition, the 201s never really seem to get to a loud volume. The Fiio e5 ventures to fix that, and succeeds immensely. Now, I can utilize the very formidable gain the amp offers, as well as the excellent bass boost. I can lose myself in my music like never before. How is this kind of power available in such a small, discreet device? An audio engineering marvel.     These are not only excellent for headphones, but for desktop speakers as well. I have a *very* cheap, 2 speaker 1 sub stereo set-up for my desktop computer, and this amp elevates them to incredible levels for the money invested. Bass is extremely present, and the clarity and attenuation of the mid-to-high ranges is remarkable in comparison to the same system without amplification.    Note: A number of reviews address hissing. In my experience, this only happens while the amp is connected to the USB charger it comes with. When the amp is off the charger, it is free of hiss. I do find, however, that I can charge while listening on my desktop speakers, and the hiss is not nearly as audible as with headphones.    Overall, the Fiio e5 headphone amplifier is a versatile, effective, and affordable solution for an entry-level, budget-minded audiophile.
B000G1ALRK|5.0|Good material breath of fresh air in generic radio. Would like to play bass at a sound check with him. Looking forward to more material in the future.
B005KGPC4S|5.0|Fantastic film, unlike anything Smith has done before. Absolutely riveting from beginning to end. Do yourself a favor and skip the trailer, the best way to go into this movie is completely blind. Great twists and an unprecedented mix of comedy, action, and horror. I saw this with my girlfriend (who has never really been a Smith fan) and we talked about it for weeks (and still do now that it is out on Instant-View). Check it out, you won't be disappointed.
B0041I0N9A|5.0|What can I say, I saw this randomly while looking at Legos and I just had to get it. Took me about 6 hours to put together. Pretty easy build, no missing parts or anything. Looks pretty cool on display when finished! Definitely a must have for Star Wars Legos colectors.
B0055PMUSU|5.0|Simply perfect. A truly inspiring movie with a very heroic young girl.  Does not get any better than this one.
1932073221|1.0|I didn't like this book. First, it had spirit guides. Second, it was too dense and complicated. Third, I didn't feel interested enough to try any of the exercises. There was too much written about why the Law of Attraction might not work if you did things wrong. This made me tense and stressed; just what I didn't want. Attracting abundance should be a simple process which can be adapted to each individual. By making it so complicated, it became useless to me. In all fairness, there were some interesting ideas in the book. Examining beliefs about money derived from childhood and dealing with them could be of use to many people. If you want to change your life and abundance, I recommend [[ASIN:0738720046 Blissology: The Art & Science of Happiness]] by Baggett. Baggett expects the Law of Attraction to work and shows you non-stressful ways to make that happen.
B0000C3I6U|5.0|What can I say? This video was history in the making... Nothing I could say would do it justice.     As far as the quality of the dvd I bought on Amazon - it came well packaged, in great condition, and just as advertised.     If you haven't seen this movie......you MUST. It will change your life, the way it changed Hollywood and the WORLD as we know it.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|opposed this version of theses Hollywood master piece because of the cgi added characters, views, and star ships. Lucas ruins our favorite childhood movies with added cgi gimmics. Literally boycott this movie
B0055SWM08|4.0|Glad I got it free. Nice little game to waste some time with with a minimum of thinking. Certainly would recommend for the money.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Once again, Lucas fails to understand what Star Wars fans want.      More mindless, deliberately jarring additions in this release. The examples being the now famous Vader line, Obi Wans scream, and the magical rock formations that sprung up around R2.    A continued inability to correct errors.  From out of place pink and green lightsabers, to crushed blacks, and a blue (not white) planet Hoth. Keep in mind that most of these were introduced either with the '97 or '04 Special Editions so they were deliberately screwed up years after the original theatrical releases.    Katie Lucas, George's daughter, possibly helped to shed some light on Lucasfilm's attitude towards this on her twitter page.  \\"haters gonna hate. And then haters are going to buy the bluray set and keep complaining\\".    Allow me to translate; \\"We don't care if you hate it, you will buy whatever junk we put out there anyways\\".    Awesome attitude.  I hope Lucas turns the keys of his Empire over to his children one day so we (the fans that lined their pockets) can continue to enjoy the abuse for years to come.

B0052VI2V6|2.0|I just received this SACD from Amazon a few days ago and played it today on my Sony XA5400ES SACD player and was immediately taken back by how average it sounded when compared to the regular stereo red-book CD edition. In stereo the Eagles Hotel California SACD seems to be tipped up in volume but sounds no better than CD. I don't like surround sound and I don't have a surround sound set up. I have a High-End Stereo setup at home and have been very disappointed lately by many of the expensive imports coming from Japan. I've found the majority of them to be bright sounding compared to their American equivalents. The one good thing I can say about this recording is that it isn't bright sounding at all. Instead it just sounds like a regular CD, nothing special, certainly not worth paying the upscale price. However I just purchased The Who's Tommy Domestic SACD and it sounds fabulous. So does the Domestic Elton John Tumbleweed Connection as well as Mad Man Across The Water. The only Japanese SACD I've heard that is great is Elton John's Goodbye Yellow Brick Road on Universal Japan. It stomps all over the harsh sounding American version and is worth every penny IMHO. For comparisons sake today I played my old trusty copy of Hotel California on vinyl pressed by Mobile fidelity in the Early 1980's and it of course bettered both the SACD & CD in every area of sound, better bass, sound stage, dynamics, midrange and so on.     This review is not meant as a put down of lovers of surround or multichannel sound. If that's your cup of tea then go ahead and enjoy. However, If you are into stereo I would suggest to stay away from this one.
B004O86JZ4|5.0|I love the Foos and every album is a treat. However without calling them \\"filler\\", I find myself skipping songs on a few of the other albums. I listened to WL front to back several times and when I wasn't able to listen to it, I wanted to. Very easy to put this on and let it repeat. White Limo is a little out of place but after watching the video for it, I was hooked....Top 3 Foo Fighters record for sure.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|The latest alterations to the OT are to much to stomach. The greatest moment of redemption in film history Takes place in The Return Of The Jedi when Darth Vader throws the Emperor off the scaffolding to his death. Everything about this scene was perfect, but not to Geor- He who shall not be named.  He who shall not be named has completely destroyed this scene buy dubbing Darth Vader saying \\"no, NOOOOO!!\\" which damages and ruins the movie. Somebody must stop He who shall not be named Before he decides to reanimate the corpse of Alec Guinness and start re-filming the movies from scratch.
B005FUTBWS|5.0|I found this movie to be visually arresting and emotionally gripping.  There is not one single bad performance in it and the characters are realized as real people; not caricatures of good or bad, left or right.  Well worth the viewing.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|I, like many, am spurred to voice my disgust on this site in hopes someone, somewhere, will try and find the good still in George Lucas and turn him from the dark side. Like many who love these films, I remember the thrill of seeing the original Star Wars upon its release (at the ripe old age of five). It remains an experience unparalleled in its excitement, wonder and joy. I even enjoyed a great deal about the oft-maligned PT, despite Jar Jar, groan-worthy romance and the total mishandling of a character that likely should have been a lot more Han Solo and a lot less whiny Twilight reject. Regardless, for the most part I have loved most things Star Wars since that first trip to the theater all those years ago.    As far as the changes to the movies, I have been mostly neutral regarding the 1997 and 2004 Special Editions. In all honesty, until the last few days I have been neither a Lucas hater nor an apologist. I even leaned in the direction of those who have sided with George in that these movies are his vision to do with as he pleases. And I was at least mostly okay with the majority of the revisions, the obvious exceptions being Han shoots (not first, because he was the only one who did) and the truly horrible Jedi Rocks (arguably the single worst sequence in the entire Saga).    Now recently we have confirmation of even more tinkering. To be fair, I am not overly bothered if Yoda is CGI, Ewoks blink and Han Solo gets inexplicably iradiated.  However, Mr. Lucas has proven that even the most patient and forgiving among fans have their breaking point. He has found mine in the already infamous \\"Darth says no\\" additions. Honestly, I wonder if the man is a sadist and is now rubbing the collective noses of those who made him what he is in his foul poodoo of \\"perfecting\\" his vision. I mean, surely he is aware of the widespread criticism of the similar \\"no\\" from ROTS. Why else would he essentially replicate that absurdity in ROTJ unless it is to basically \\"shoot the bird\\" to those who have (rightly) claiimed ol' GL lost his grip on Star Wars a long, long time ago? I am certain he would claim otherwise, but this for me was the final insult added to the already egregious injury.  Of course I have not even mentioned the changes that should have been made (all the color issues from the DVD release) and were not.    So it is with heavy heart (but lightened wallet) that I cancelled my pre-order today. One can always hope against hope that if enough of us raise our voices eventually we will be heard. But to be honest, I don't see anything changing until Emperor Lucas is somehow removed from power. It seems he shares an unfortunate trait with his counterpart from the Saga: Their overconfidence is their weakness, and neither seems capable of admitting they were wrong.
B005KGPC4S|5.0|A very good movie by Kevin Smith (Silent Bob). It was not made or released in typical Hollywood fashion, and the end result is something much more entertaining and riveting than your typical Hollywood movie.<br /><br />I went into this movie knowing nothing about it other than it was directed by Kevin Smith, and it was not a comedy. I was not prepared for how riveting this movie was going to be. However, I was pleasantly surprised. I recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Kevin Smith, action movies, or anything well made.
0812979656|5.0|It was an absolute pleasure to read this book. I loved the way the story is weaved with the present and the past merging in so well in alternate chapters. At many points, I found myself re-reading pages to absorb Arundhati Roy's beautiful metaphors and vivid descriptions of human emotions.I recommend this book as a must read for anyone who thirsts for emotionally intelligent writing.
0671449028|5.0|I have a 2-year-old son and I got this book for him when he was about a year old.  Since then we have read it every single night before going to bed and he never tires of it!  It is a cute story about getting ready for bed, and as all of Sandra Boynton's books, it has a good sing-song type of rhythm which keeps younger children attentive.  As my son has gotten older he has memorized the book, and while I can't get him to actually \\"read\\" the book to me, he finishes the sentences on every page and gets mad if I finish the sentence without letting him.  We've had to start doing this with all of Boynton's books that he has memorized.  He loves his Boynton books the most out of all of his books!
B002KKCWP4|5.0|These sandals are just great. I can hike in them, wear them to water events like crossing streams or water parks. Use them for walking around town, or just kicking back in them. Extremely comfortable with lots of padding. Great fit and great traction. I love to hike in them. Great on trails with excellent traction and I can go right through creeks with no problem. They even comfortably fit by big 'ol fat foot! Got rid of my water shoes for these. Just a great all around outdoor adventure sandal.
B001FZ0A72|5.0|I love all the albums of Dead Can Dance.  The basic instrumentation of this one album has Violins, Violas, Cellos, Trumpets, Trombones, a Tuba, an Oboe, and Timpani and Military Snare.  Though, this sounds like it would just be some tiresome classical music, it has a beautiful ancient Gothic feel.<br /><br />Brendan Perry has a deep rich voice that sounds harmonious with the rich strings behind him, and Lisa Gerrard's high pitch chanting offers some necessary tinniness to accent all that surrounding bass output.  Since I've upgraded my Dead Can Dance collection with the latest remastering release from a couple years ago, my stereo has really been put to the challenge of capturing the true sound of every string, and drum vibration. And of course, Brendan and Lisa's diverse vocal outputs.<br /><br />If only I could play my stereo in a huge cathedral.  I believe I would see God.
075640407X|5.0|This is one of my favorite books.     All too often fantasy novels involve uninspired tropes and mediocre writing.  I love language, words, and poetry.  And this book made me very happy.  The world-building is also excellent, and includes some intriguing exploration of class differences.  I also very much enjoyed the author's creative take on his world's system of magic.  It weaves together different elements of folklore in a way that keeps it fresh and interesting.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I have heard complaint after complaint on how George Lucas ruined his saga.  However, in honesty the critics ruined the series, not Lucas.  For those who do not recall, Phantom Menace featured a character (who I thoroughly enjoyed watching) Jar Jar Binks.  Now for some odd reason, supposed fans of this movie took it upon themselves to start an \\"I HATE JAR JAR\\" campaign against the film.  Oddly it was not started by those who first watched the film (It received very high remarks as a \\"return to the original style\\" that made the original trilogy famous).  But many hated it and e-mailed Lucas about their grievances.  When it was time to produce the second of the prequels, Lucas took these complaints and used them to create the weakest film of the saga -- \\"Attack of the Clones\\".  Although Lucas attempted to make fans happy, many were critical of the films name.  Something that Lucas stood by from the upstart.  In the finally of the Prequels, \\"Revenge of the Sith\\"  Many raved that the film was the best of the entire series.  However, overtime, many began complaining about the NOOOOOOO!!!!! comment made by Vader in the films ending.  So it does not surprise me at all that people are going to complain about anything new Lucas adds to his masterpiece.  So considering all these complaints, I have it on good word from Lucas that the best addition to these films, will either be added before distribution, or just before the next round of redistribution.    In this never before seen NEW footage, Darth Vader screams NO! after seeing the Emperor attack Luke and before throwing him over the rail and down the shaft of the Death Star.  However, this is not actually new footage.  The restored sound actually returns the phrase originally in the 1983 theatrical version of the film.  From the sound of it though, I think Lucas added one additional No before throwing the Emperor over the rail.  Anyways the new footage happens immediately after this crucial scene an d marks the return of Jar Jar Binks!!!    IN this new footage, we discover Jar Jar has been working with Anakin and the Emperor on the Death Star.  He has been crucial in gathering up every Jar Jar Bink hating critic across the Galaxy ad placing them in a special detention center that was once used as a docking station.  After Jar Jar hears the Emperors screams, Jar Jar gets a force message from Anakin that it is time to press the release button on their hostages.  However, in typical Jar Jar fashion he hits the wrong button and sends these critics into the dead of space.  Now many would figure that the Rebels would rescue these helpless people.  But Lando Calrissian remembered how many of them called him a traitor for turning Han over to Boba Fett.  So he accidentally fires a few rounds into the critics who hated him most for his actions.  Although unable to get them all before the Death Star explodes, never fear, for the Super Death Star also gets its revenge on those so critical of this storyplot and when it blows up, it sends millions of pieces through the survivors of Lando's attack.   Back on Endor, Luke, Han, Lando, Vader, Qui Gon, Jar Jar, the Emperor, Yoda, and Obi-Wan all make a toast to the end of the critics of this highly successful franchise.   OR AT LEAST LUCAS SHOULD INCLUDE THIS SCENE IN THE MOVIE!!!!!        No matter what people state about the Blu-Ray release, STAR WARS will always be one of the greatest films ever made.  And I am sure on Blu-Ray it will still remain great.  If critics really want to complain about something, then why didn't they get angry when Paramount changed their beloved Star Ship Enterprise in the Special Release of Star Trek The Original Series????  They made the once bold looking ship look like something found in an early Buck Rodgers film --- A true disgrace.  What few so-called flaws by Lucas will generate more sales of these films (one more time) for those who are looking at the perfected version of this film saga.    What is even more of a disgrace for me (and I include myself in this list for making fun of the Starship Enterprise) is do any of us really recall why we loved these films?  Or are we just attempting to compare them to the more recent film hits  (like \\"The Matrix\\", Harry Potter, or Avatar)?  I have never seen anytime that Lucas has ruined these films, and as many know, he will rerelease this set once more, and include in the original films.  So why complain critics?  You know you will still buy this package just like you have purchased every package since the films rerelease in the early 90s.  That is my opinion of it anyways.   AND YES, I DID LIKE and still LIKE JAR JAR BINKS!!!!  That was probably the only character who was close to being what every young Star Wars fan looked forward to seeing in every new film.  And notice I stated \\"Young Fan\\"????  These films were made for eth young and young at heart.  So no matter what changes Lucas does to them (without erasing the film altogether) will not hurt the films true fans --- The KIDS!!!!
0061433047|1.0|Up until now I've liked everything I've read by Terry Pratchett  but this is the last book of his I will be buying.  One of the things that I have enjoyed so much about Terry Pratchett's work in the past  is the number of well-developed, interesting, female characters that he creates.  That, along with his wit and humor,  should have made him a great choice to write a series for young adults, particularly teenage girls.     Unfortunately the beginning of the book involves a great deal of time spent on the topics of spousal and child abuse, and the way that Pratchett chooses to handle the topic is offensive and potentially quite harmful.  Every awful stereotype  I've heard about battered women is rehashed.   The protagonist seems to see the batterer as more redeemable than his victim.  The batterer places flowers on the grave of the fetus he caused his daughter to miscarry, and Tiffany consequently describes him as having \\"something good\\" inside of him.  Nothing positive is said about his poor wife who he has been beating for years- she is dirty, promiscuous, a bad mother, a bad housekeeper.  At one point Tiffany and another sympathetic female character sit down and discuss how she is worse than an animal.        Teenage girls are particularly vulnerable to dating violence.  This is the last thing that they (or anybody)  should be reading on the subject.     Other portions of the book are engaging and fun, but Pratchett's thoroughly terrible handling of such an important topic that is sadly going to be relevant to many of his reader's lives ruined it for me.  The sheer meanness of his portrayal of survivors of domestic violence has also unfortunately  put me off the rest of his work as well.  I just don't think I can enjoy anything else by him knowing that he's capable of this level of victim blaming and flat out cruelty.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|I love the Matrix Trilogy, but the price point was what made this a must buy for me.  These films must be seen using blu-ray technology.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|This was the best movie I have seen in a VERY LONG TIME!  It was fun and kept with the spirit of the comics....  Reading these reviews I can tell those who read the comics from those who haven't!  I am sooo glad they didn't change the character or the story to be more Hollywood....  I would Have been devastated!

B001FBSMW6|5.0|Great CD; continues to exemplify Keane amazing sound and style. If you like British bands, you'll love Keane. They're all so incredibly talented and I hope that they continue to create and record their music.
B004HO6I4M|4.0|Most of whether or not someone enjoys this movie is going to be really subjective, so I'll stick to what I consider to be objective: the look of the animation.  Put simply, this is a visually stunning film.  If they were looking to showcase the possibilities of high-definition animation to dazzle the sense, they succeeded entirely.  It has a neat, fairly charming, and even refreshingly (somewhat) original story that I should think any adolescent or younger child will love, and it's got enough \\"ooh, shiny\\" factor to keep my two-year old entranced.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|This movie was so great, I'm send it to all my girl friends for Christmas. Loved it! Witty, sarcastic, and painfully real. Loved every moment!
B004GYY714|4.0|It does all it promises and more. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it missed a major local station and I still have not figured out how to manually search for it (or if there is even a feature to do so). Other than that, sound is good, buffering is good and it offers enough choices to keep me in music for a long time. I would *almost* ditch the XM except there are long stretches where I live when lose signal to everything but the XM.

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|The U.S. is still a big, greedy kid that apparently won't grow up and become responsible, if it ever does, until it's undergone some real threats to its existence.  The country is still playing at fulfilling the romantic frontiersmen image, and this is enabled because it hasn't yet used up all its natural resources, filled up its land with cities, and been invaded by marauding armies.  European nations long ago went through all that and have realized that their survival depends on efficiency in using what resources they have.  Michael Moore's film very clearly shows how this country's immaturity manifests itself in its outrageous \\"healthcare\\" system.  If I were several years younger, I might well decamp to Canada and become a canuck.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|People who alter or destroy works of art and our cultural heritage for profit or as an exercise of power are barbarians, and if the laws of the United States continue to condone this behavior, history will surely classify us as a barbaric society.    In the future it will become even easier for old negatives to become lost and be \\"replaced\\" by new altered negatives. This would be a great loss to our society. Our cultural history must not be allowed to be rewritten.    Attention should be paid to this question of our soul, and not simply to accounting procedures. Attention should be paid to the interest of those who are yet unborn, who should be able to see this generation as it saw itself, and the past generation as it saw itself.    1988 Mr. Lucas' speech to congress.
B005COO1X6|3.0|Mile 81 is a great way to distract yourself for 15 minutes. And it's also a great way to freak out. A short and terrifying read. An abandoned rest-stop, a broken down station wagon covered in mud, and a bunch of kids - it's a Stephen King story, what could possiblly go wrong? :-)<br /><br />I would have rated this a bit higher but I'm not quite sure of the end. My complaint is that it seems rather abrupt, but that could also be because I just want more of this story (something that routinely happens when I read Stephen King). Definitely worth a few dollars and it's a nice little break from that larger more dense novel that you're most likely reading. Good for a lunch break or a cup of coffee. Enjoy.
B000IY06CK|5.0|Julia Fischer is one of the finest violinists around, and this recording is one of the best of Tchiakovsky's popular Violin Concerto. Ms. Fischer plays with great fire, equally from emotion as well as from intellect, while most others are capable of only the former. To her, this music is worth doing as well as it can be, which means emphasizing the archetecture of the concerto and the relationship of the three other pieces on this disc to it. Ms Fischer plays the complete, uncut concerto with all the repeats in the first and third movements intact, which displays the formal balance of the work. Other violinists cut these repeats, which seems to say they merely want to barnstorm through the piece, placing emphasis on themselves. This is frankly what Heifetz and many others do, not taking the piece seriously as the interesting work it is. By the way, most of Ms Fischer's other recordings are of an equally high value, such as her recording of the Brahms \\"Double\\", also with Mr Kreitzberg and the Russian National Orchestra.         For many years before I had heard this disc, however, this work was just a fashionable warhorse I never listened to anymore. I used to own the Heifetz/Reiner, but I got tired of it and of the music itself. Gradually, though, I wondered if there might be a better way to play the piece which presented it as music rather than emphasizing it as a collection of tawdry tunes you've heard a million times.  The wind parts seemed important for their timbre, for example, but it seemed no one focused on them. No one, that is, until I heard this recording, the reviews of which seemed to describe a performance of exactly the sort I wanted.  Think of Mravinsky's classic accounts of Symphonies 4,5,6 with the old Lenningrad Phil on DG with their lean textures and attention to detail. But, you also had to bring out the winds. That is part of the accomplishment of Yakov Kreitzberg, a conductor I'd never heard of, but who was obviously one of the most outstanding young conductors of his generation. (I say \\"was\\" because tragically, Mr. Kreitzberg left us in March of 2011. What a loss to music!)  Here, this Russian-American master leads his excellent Russian orchestra with great skill and aplomb, presenting this music in a completely convincing way. This is the performance I'd hoped for, because it lets the music speak for itself, and it speaks very eloquently with no need of any exaggeration. We shouldn't forget that Tchiakovsky's favorite was Mozart.               The three companion pieces on this disc are all just as well played in performances which  simply present them as interesting in themselves as well as for their connection to the concerto. This is particularly true of the last of the three, the lesser-known \\"Souvenir,\\" which begins with what is apparently the original slow movement of the concerto, and which is very well played by Mr Kreitzberg's piano accompaniment of Ms Fischer's beautifully played part. All of these brief works are more than just fillers, and they're all played as well and as interestingly as the concerto.          Finally, the SACD sound is a great plus, and it increases the listener's enjoyment and understanding of music that should be taken much more seriously than as just virtuoso fodder, and Ms Fischer and Yakov Kreitzberg must be congratulated for accomplishing this. This is the recording to live with.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|Went through several cases before trying this one.  All the others either cracked, did not fit well or were not acceptable quality... this one is perfect.  Great quality, fits very snugly, all slots are aligned exactly with ports/ plugs, and is flexy to provide some degree of shock protection.  Also makes it immune to cracking.  It is a bit thicker than the other cases I've tried and that might bother you if you want something super low-profile... but personally I think it looks and feels great.  I can't speak to the screen protector as I already had one one there... but otherwise I'm very happy and so glad I got this phone case business resolved at last!
161720238X|5.0|The universe lies in every one of us. Everything you need is within yourself. You will not find it at church, you will not find it at the mall, you will not find it in your spouse. They will bring you some happiness, but they are not binding. If you want absolute happiness, you need to create it within yourself first, before you can be happy with anyone or anything else. If you want absolute success, you need to create it within yourself, decide what you want, live it until it manifests. I have used the Power of the Mind to pull myself from the gutter of severe drug abuse and poverty and bitter negativity from an abusive childhood to one of sincere joy, happiness and success. I still have plenty of scars, and they will be with me forever, but they serve as a reminder to stay grateful for everything I have now and keeps powering me forward. I now own my own business that has been booming through this economic downturn. In my former job, I received bonuses that doubled my annual salary for two years in a row! I am debt free, own a beautiful home, and am with the love of my life. I live every day charting my own destiny. I still pinch myself sometimes because as a younger man, thought I was doomed to failure, that I was a born loser. I could fill an ocean with all my tears. The darkness nearly consumed me. The stark contrast from my former like to my life now is simply breathtaking. And I give gratitude to God everyday and stay humble and respectful and try to help others thru charity and donations and random acts of kindness. I never take anything for granted and use understanding and hope when things don't always go right, removing fear from the equation. This book is one of the best books out there to help understand how to achieve these things. Emerald Tablet - That which is below is like that which is above that which is above is like that which is below to do the miracles of one only thing. I feel everyone has the ability to unlock this potential, but most are too fearful and skeptical, or suffocated by those around them that are, to find their power within. This doesn't take weeks or months, it takes a full lifetime dedicated to building a healthy respect for yourself, life and God.

B001E45XT4|4.0|Sound:  I was a little skeptical as to weather the sound quality would be any good based on a few of the bad reviews given.  When I got it, as mentioned in other reviews, the sound was extremely high pitched, it sounded good but there was just no where near enough bass to call them \\"gaming\\" headphones.  I looked into getting a headphone amp, but didn't want to pay the money.  Looking at a few of the reviews for some cheaper \\"amps\\" I saw that some did little more than change the pitch.  That's when I realized that all it really needed was an equalizer.  I used this old, RCA equalizer (I think the brand is \\"Dimensia\\") that you could probably get at any yard sale for a few bucks.  Anyway I hooked it all up and played around with the equalizer until I got it to sound right.  While it's not boosted base it still sounds really good for cheap headphones.    Comfort:  As far as comfort goes, my head is larger than \\"normal,\\" wear glasses, and I have had no problems with to much pressure on my head.  The padding is really good for long term use, and as of yet I have not had a problem with them being to hot.  While physically quite large, I have yet to have a problem with neck strain due to the weight of these headphones, they are actually quite light for there size. Then again, as a welder I am used to having large, heavy objects of my head for hours at a time, so others may have a problem.  My only real complaint is that sound dampening is non-existent so you can hear everything around you, but I consider this minor.    Portable sound:  Just for the heck of it I also tried these on my psp, while I wasn't blown away by the sound, the little thing push them pretty well.  And they didn't sound to bad without the built in equalizer on, but they sounded really good with a bit a bass boost.    Microphone:  The mic is only average I could hear quite a bit of distortion, but for gaming or voice chat it works fine.  Summary: good for the money, need an equalizer to be really good though.  Edit: 2 months into use I can start to hear a bit of distortion.  It is most noticeable when nothing is going to the speakers, there is a highish pitched static that gets worse when the mouse is moved.  It might not be noticeable for some people but for me it is very annoying.  Lowered to 4 stars

B003Y74AXO|3.0|These were a little more difficult to put on than the screen protector films I am used to, but once on they stayed in place.  (That is the high score for functionality)<br /><br />What I disliked about them was the texture.  It seemed to make my screen a little harder to see and read from and that is the sole reason I would not purchase these again.  If that improved, I would choose these over the brand I normally use for price alone, because all other things being equal, they do their job.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|I have grown up with the Star Wars canon ever since the seventies, and I've seen and enjoyed them in their various incarnations over the years. To my taste, they have continuously been upgraded and tweaked for the better. The 1997 versions as well as the 2004 ones on DVD. As they now appear on Bluray, I have seen the various alterations to be expected in the films.    Generally, I don't see what everyone keeps fuzzing about!!! Just face it, the films are the director's / producer's creation and he has the sole right to do what he wants with them. He simply stays true to his vision. I can certainly see that the limitations of the time when the early films were produced, made Lucas compromise with what effects he could achieve. This also applies to the retouched Yoda of TPM, which wasn't achievable in 1999, the early days of CGI animation. Today, when the possibilites and finances are there, he simply goes ahead. What Lucas does may be strange compared to many other modern film makers. But in a way, he is working like many classical music composers of the past, for example Brahms, Sibelius etc who worked on their symphonic work for an entire lifetime; they issued a premier version in their youth, withdrew it, changed it, relaunched it, withdrew it, changed it, relaunched it, and so on. Meaning that today their symphonies exist in a number of versions that a lot of contemporary classical labels want to record and release for the first time. Like these composers, Lucas has a vision that he wants to fulfil, and feels free to update his work whenever he feels it is right. Star Wars is the man's Magnum Opus, or lifetime achievement, and he seems set on spending a lifetime with his films. I cannot blame the man for this.    I don't personally mind the tweaks that Lucas offers with the Bluray release. I don't even mind Vader's added \\"Noooo!\\". That it entirely spoils the impact of the ending is, in my view, an exaggeration. People have complained about the flat acting in thenew trilogies, and claimed that Vader's added exclamation goes along the same lines of alleged second-rate melo-drama. Well, Lucas has mentioned before in interviews that his object with the Star Wars films is to create them in accordance with the old-fashioned matinée serials broadcast in the 50s. Which undoubtedly all were cheesy and contained less-than-stellar acting. The core of the problem is that the inclusion of old-fashioned melo-drama just does not rhyme with the way films are done today, nor with a modern day film audience. Modern film makers tend to prefer an understated, subtle portrayal, and let the audience use their brains. Watch any old film from the 40s-60s and you will notice how un-subtle and overstated the acting is; it is not easy to become emotionally stirred by those old films. So, in that respect, giving Vader a \\"Nooo!\\" before he tosses the emperor, goes exactly in line with how films were done back in those days, which, in fact, is what Lucas wants to achieve.    So, quit complaining about the Bluray release! I am, like many others, looking forward to these! Stop comparing the films (the prequels in particular) to other modern films - these are shaped differently, according to a 50s serial blueprint. Accept these versions as they are - they are the director's vision. If you want to recreate something you were obsessed with in your childhood, go back and watch the old versions on VHS. The Blurays present Lucas' vision, an adherence to old-fashioned film making, but with modern day technology, and on the best digital format today. Alike my examples with different versions of old symphonies, another studio may someday hunt down the old versions of Star Wars, remaster them and issue them on Bluray - or whatever format may be the optimal home video experience in the future.
B0007MWZEK|2.0|It is very difficult to insert the long pieces of the handle together.   Also, I charged the battery for a full 24 hours to start and it worked for 15 minutes before needing a recharge. I would have been better off to purchase a light vacuum cleaner than this noisy broom.

I've watched the movie on my laptop, portable dvd player and our PS3 and that scene skips every time, even the first time we watched it. The disc is flawless, no scratches, not any visible dust.

B005IZLPMY|4.0|I'm a big time comic book fan, so I knew I was going to see this in theaters ever since it was announced. However, I was never a big Captain America fan; he just never appealed to me in the way that other iconic superheroes like Spider-Man and Superman did, which was largely due to never feeling the character's personality was as clearly defined as it should be for such a premiere superhero, even after reading most of Ed Brubaker's run on the title, which is considered one of the most definitive runs on Captain America.<br /><br />What sold me on the experience and made me excited about seeing this movie was that moment in the third trailer when a grenade is tossed amongst Steve Rogers (Captain America) and the rest of the super soldier candidates and everyone else runs away from the threat while Steve's instinct is to protect others from it. This was the moment when I said, \\"Oh, wow, they nailed it.\\" It will also undoubtedly go down as one of my favorite all time superhero movie moments.<br /><br />Chris Evans did an excellent job carrying the essence of that scene with him throughout the entire film, which makes Steve come off as genuine in a role that could have easily oozed corniness. I had faith in Evans ever since I saw his portrayal of a no-nonsense astronaut in Sunshine, and I'm glad to say he's silenced any critics who thought he couldn't dial back the wisecracking that he's known for and given Cap a different feel than Human Torch, having played both superheroes.<br /><br />You can say the same for the performances of the film's other stars like Stanley Tucci, Tommy Lee Jones, Hayley Atwell, and Hugo Weaving. There were a lot of moments and lines that this movie could have fumbled based on their concept, but the actors and creative team clearly bought into the idea of Steve wanting to serve and fight simply because it was the right thing to do.<br /><br />There are really only a couple of negatives with the film, the first being I thought Cap's fighting scenes could have been polished up a bit more and the second being I wanted a little more screen time for Red Skull.<br /><br />All things considered, I'd definitely say the thing that makes this the best Marvel Studios production since Iron Man is the heart, and I mean this in multiple respects. Too often a studio will churn out a big budget film like this and concentrate more on effects and merchandising than story and character development. After being disappointed by the lack of heart in DC's summer offering of Green Lantern, I'm hoping other superhero films and blockbusters in general will try to have as much substance to go along with the flash as Captain America.a bit more and the second being I wanted a little more screen time for Red Skull.

B0057A6GA6|5.0|Great game play.  I recommend this game for tower defense lovers.  Fun graphics.  Only thing I suggest is a shop to buy some upgrades or something. Other than that this game has lots of levels and hours of play time!
0470503696|3.0|The book is good for someone with no experience in Visual Basic. The examples are very manageable, however, I would have liked to have seen some more complicated code. But, I realize that this book is for dummies and it does fulfill the needs of a laymen.     I would suggest this for anyone who is excel savvy and wants to learn the basics of Visual Basic. I have enrolled in a Visual Basic programming class, since reading this book, and it has given me a good foundation for understanding this Windows based programming language.

0618680004|4.0|Richard Dawkins is brilliant. This book is a great road map for anyone who may doubt their conventional beliefs. For anyone not British, he will add a few new words into one's lexicon. I personally think everyone should read this book.
030788743X|5.0|All night. Rock the night away.<br /><br />A started this book at 6 pm and I finished it early next morning.  All I can say is, \\"fun!\\" I haven't had this much fun reading a book in a long time.  The plot is engaging and never slows down for a second.  All of the 80s pop culture takes me back to my childhood. I loved this book so much that I almost started reading it again right away.

0800141660|5.0|Love Sense and Sensability. It would be so nice if people were required to be courteous and well mannered as they are in this movie.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Talk about adding a cheesiness factor. Look, I'm not saying that it's not what Vader is thinking, but adding things at this point is just wrong. Stop, back off, and give us the originals like we want them.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I'd only heard about the story PERSUASION. I was not disappointed in the movie...glued to the set. I just wish their getting back together lasted longer.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Pre-order cancelled, as an avid Blu Ray and Star Wars fan, I was counting down the days....      Until I saw a sneak peek at the latest changes, which for me was the end.      It says a lot when most of us here value our VHS versions, over Blu Ray releases.      Have a word with yourself George Lucas.
0061997811|5.0|Love this book; it's so bright and colorful and has a lot of stuff on each page. I'm about halfway through so far but I do wish that they had more of the casts' personal stories/memories from filming. Overall, very pleased! Worth it!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Episodes I-III are all fine, I never really had a problem with these, despite being a bigger fan of the   original trilogy.        However, I simply cannot defend Lucas anymore, these latest changers are beyond stupid now, I've put  up with the 97 and 04 versions, but the scene at the end of Return of the Jedi is now ruined.      Pre-order cancelled, WILL stick with the DVD's.
B004EQAVHI|4.0|I watched this film thinking it was a love story...trying to score some points with my wife.  There may be love in this story, but I would certainly not call it a love story.  I absolutely loved this film.  My wife did not.  This film has the potential to scare the pants off you but not in a \\"SAW\\" sort of way.  The idea of this film stayed with me for days after I watched it.  I have a small collection of films that I don't watch often but feel I need to own.  Examples of this collection are Brazil, GATTICA and Kafka.  Never Let Me Go will fit right in with that collection.  Being careful not to let the cat out of the bag, I will just say that you should give this film a try.  It really says something about how our society could stray if we don't keep a close watch on it.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|4-Boston-Boston   Ok, cliche' time, this album rocks from front to back! And this was the First record that introduced that patented guitar sound that made all other Boston albums seem like copies of the first. But, here it was new and fresh, and mindblowing to say the least. One of my alltime favorite songs is \\"More Than A Feeling\\", when that pretty guitar fades in, you know it immediatly. You can't help but nod along. I don't think many records at all could start right out of the box with a song this strong and this good. There are so many levels to this song, so many shades of color, that even today after thousands of listens, I can still hear stuff in it, I never did before. If This had been their only song, it still would have sealed theor fate as innovators and true legends. And all this around a re write of \\"Louie Louie\\" absolutely amazing!  \\"Piece Of Mind\\" and \\"Rock And Roll Band\\" are just pure good rock songs about life in the real world, and trying to be a band when everyone is telling you either to \\"get a real job\\" or \\"Do your job, hippy\\".  The 1-2 punch of \\"Forplay/Long Time\\" is hard to beat anywhere, the bass in \\"Long Time\\" in the right system, will make the gangsta in the car next to you, (with \\"Boom Boom\\" in his system making his car shake and shiver at at a dead stop) look over at you in envy and defeat. I LIVE for that moment in that song when at the third chorus, the acoustic guitar is replaced with that razor sharp one, awesome does not even begin to describe it. \\"Smokin'\\" was the hardest one for me to get into, as it is so keyboard heavy, but once you get past that and realize it is just a great jam, the song comes together nicely. \\"Take You Home Tonight\\" is probably my least favorite, as it has some timing issues, but I will listen to it occassionally.  But the REAL gem here is \\"Gonna Hitch A Ride\\"  My God, this song is Beautiful! The writing and arranging here is the best bar none. The dueling guitar solos are unbelievably good. The melodies and Harmonies all come together in this song to really come very close to what Jimi Hendrix once described his music as, which is \\"sound paintings\\". This song is the absolute best song on an album full of top shelf stuff.  This moment of brilliance on these guy's.parts could and almost does outshine \\"More than A Feeling\\", but I gotta go with the \\"show opener\\" as the one coming out ahead, but believe me, it's close, VERY close.     R.I.P. Brad Delp, he of the angelic voice. You will be misssed, brother.

They look cool but most are just not possible. I have tried again and again to create the structures and i have steady hands but its no use. The kids got annoyed when they couldn't make the structures but they still play with it.

The author has a very engaging storytelling style, and it was fascinating to see the interweaving of various stories/incidents.  Whether you are runner or not, this is a great book to read.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Great cooler.  Dropped my temps 8-10 degrees from stock cooler.  This was my first aftermarket cooler and I found the installation to be pretty easy.  Watch the installation video and it is straight forward.  I have a i-7 930 and a cooler master HAF 932 full tower case.  If you don't have a mobo cut-out in your case you will have to take out the mobo to put the backplate on.  It is very tall so make sure it will fit in your case.

B005ILYW1E|4.0|Pretty typical rogue cop handles crime his own way in this suspense film of a police serial killer with some revengeful issues he's aiming to satisfy. The film makes no effort to hide the identity of the killer but weaves it's story around a few of the murders and Jason's attempt to identify and find the killer. Pretty straight forward but what makes this film worth the time is the acting for all involved was good+ enough to be entertaining and engaging. To illustrate, visualize Jason's usual disheveled raw urban persona during his interview of a witness.  The witness asks, \\"Ain't you gonna take any notes?\\" to which Jason replies, \\"Do I look like I carry a pencil?\\" That sums up the movie but of course you have to see and hear it to appreciate it's import.
B005KGPC4S|5.0|Easily one of Kevin Smith's best works. Exceptional writing, awesome acting, and thought provoking. Definitely a film like you've never seen before.
1439170916|2.0|As a medical historian and physician, I sat down with Dr. Mukherjee's book and, as the title suggested ,expected to read a comprehensive historical review of the topic. The book was informative and written in an easy style yet the contents were extremely limited and disappointing.    For a supposedly authoritative work, it is unconscionable that the seminal role of Memorial Hospital in New York,(since 1948 Memorial Sloan Kettering) the epicenter for cancer treatment and research for decades, was completely ignored. Reading this book, one would get the impression that nothing of value in cancer treatment ever occurred outside of Massachusetts! James Ewing, the most important figure in the history of cancer in America, is barely mentioned. Fred Stewart,Chief of Pathology at Memorial, a giant in his field and the first editor of the journal CANCER is not mentioned at all, neither is pioneering surgeon Hayes Martin nor a host of other seminal figures. George Pack, perhaps the most complete oncologist of the twentieth century, is written off as \\"Pack the Knife\\".    The history of radiation therapy, still one of the backbones of cancer treatment, is notably undertreated, in fact it is virtually absent. Gioachinno Failla, Edith Quimby and those that established the principals of dosimetry that are still utilized today are nowhere to be found.     Obviously, Dr. Mukherjee's practice is based on chemotherapy and this aspect is addressed quite well, but essentially ignoring the value of surgery and radiation therapy is an unexcusable flaw in any work that professes to be a comprehensive treatise. A far more approriate title would have been \\"A History of Chemotherapy\\".     Aside from this, there are numerous factual errors that an uninformed reader would not recognize. For example, Streptomycin was not discovered in 1949 as Dr Mukherjee states, the first human dose was given at the Mayo Clinic in 1944.     Perhaps some day a truly authoritarian work on the history of cancer will appear. This work does not qualify as such.
B003YBUSMW|4.0|*I have made some changes and updates to my review*<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Quality-The wheel feels good but the rest comes off as toyish. There is some weight on the wheel that makes it feel solid and sturdy.<br /><br />Wireless-Only one wire to the pedals. Easy to put up and put away. There is a 5v 1 amp jack for an ac adapter. The description says that it is included but it is NOT. The batteries does have an okay life IF you don't use it all the time.<br /><br />Steering-Although no vibration or force feedback, it still feels better than any other wheel with no force feedback. I prefer this over certain games like arcade racers or for drifting. By the way, always dial-in the dead-zone if you can. Racers like Forza or Shift (especially) needs some adjustments.<br /><br />Design-The wheel looks sharp. Madcatz has come a long way compared to their other wheels. One of the better looking wheels in my opinion. The pedals are toy looking and feel cheap and bulky though. They should have put more effort into them. Waste of plastic. They do work fine though.<br /><br />Table/desk clamp-Very important to have. Should be mandatory for all wheels. The clamp mounts the wheel very solidly. World's better than sitting it on your lap. For the best experience you don't put a wheel on your lap. Get a cheap desk, table, chair, etc. Better yet, build or buy a cockpit if you can. One obstacle would possibly be the center clamp. It only clamps in the middle and hangs down between your legs. This design can get in the way of your legs and cockpits that are designed with a center post wheel mounting plate. It will not work or you will need to fabricate something. A good design would be something like Logitech. There are two clamps on each side and is low profile and can be mounted on any cockpit out there.<br /><br />Shifting options-Paddles feels good and it is nice to have an option for left or right handed shifting. Great to simulate any car you're driving. It is responsive. There is no 'click' sound when shifting and that is what people will usually prefer.<br /><br />Mounting holes-It is there if you want to hard mount it. No need to drill into the equipment. The odd thing is the screws will be at an angle and not level when mounting to the wheel. You would actually be using the mounts that are made for the lap mounts. It will still get the job done. Just don't over tighten. There are four screw mounting locations to the wheel and four to the pedals. The pedal mounts are on the removable foot rest itself. That definitely will not give you a solid mount. Hard mounting would require to drill the pedal base and add a nut inside the pedals and then bolt it up.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />No force or vibration feedback-Makes the racing experience numb. I own a Microsoft force feedback wheel, Logitech Driving Force GT, and tried a Fanatec CSR Elite. It is kind of hard to go back to a wheel with no feedback whatsoever. In some games I do prefer without force feedback. This is something that I don't really have a problem living with. At least a vibration would nice. But it is still better than a controller for most racers. A good sound system or headphone could compensate it a bit. A tactile transducer would even be better too.<br /><br />Pedals-It would be great if the gas and brake was just a bit closer. I am a size nine and have already adapted. When they sit on a flat surface the angle is almost horizontal. For a good position they need to be at an angle. It wouldn't take too much effort to address those issues. Everything on the pedals is cheap. So much plastic and the feel is generic. They don't even look nice. It is a waste and looks like it came from their parts bin made for a different product. It is cheesy and goofy. As I said before, they do work fine.<br /><br />*edit* I have switched the pedals out to an old Thrustmaster Nascar pedals. All you do is just swap out the wires and solder them to the pots the same way like it was in Madcatz pedals. The travel is exactly the same. They feel and look better. Huge improvement for me. The old ones was just an eyesore.<br /><br />No click when shifting-A little click would be good to have when changing gears. It can also come off as a bit mushy since it makes no sound at all. But so far the gear changing has caused no problems and never had skipped a shift. Maybe the only good thing is no one around you would be bothered by the constant clicking sound. I do believe that they went with this route was because of using cheaper switches.<br /><br />Cost-This should be $115 tops. I paid $130 when they were first released here. Now these are going for $160? That is ridiculous. If you want force feedback then pick up a used MS wheel $50-100. Or save money for a low-end Fanatec (new or used). If you don't care about the lack of force or vibration then this wheel would probably be the best. Usually wheels that offer no feedback or vibration are also very poorly built.<br /><br />Reliability-Had it for almost a year and then the D-pad crapped out. Keep your receipts! I feel that the wheel they replaced it with could possibly be more reliable from the one first one I bought. The pedal attachment foot rest is different. It has a plastic lip (flange?) in the opening. The color looks slightly different. The wheel was purchased shortly after the release the states. Hopefully my replacement wheel is improved over the 1 batches they made.<br /><br />No power supply adapter included-They need to change their description! It will save you money on batteries for the long run if you use it all the time.<br /><br />I can only recommend the wheel if you don't mind the lack of vibration or force feedback. My wheel and pedals is now properly mounted to a cockpit and I can tell you that it is sweet. It makes it that much better. Before it was mounted to a desk. But the price too high in my opinion. You can purchase second hand but then you will have to gamble it's reliability. Buying new at least you have 2 years.<br /><br />*Customer support can use some work!

B005COO1X6|5.0|Entertaining read, short and sweet. If I enjoyed it, you will too. Stephen King delivers yet again. Truly a great read, with a cast of memorable characters with an invigorating plot make Mile 81 a short story worthy of your attention.
B001Q8FRNK|4.0|And I say it again....  GREAT!    After stumbling upon these guys I see why so many folks wonder why they are not given more attention.
B004V5QWU2|5.0|Im a \\" white noise\\" kind of guy and I love all of the customizable sounds. The sounds were far better quality than I had expected. I will have to agree with those who say some of the clips are too short which can sometimes be noticeable as they loop. Overall, I really like the app and use it alot when studying. I would have gone 5 stars if it had a save feature.  UPDATE  With the latest update, they have added a SAVE feature! Awesome!!! So I've updated to 5-stars as well, Now...if we could just add a 4th or 5th sound, I'd give 6 stars!

B003ZSJ212|1.0|Like many here, I grew up going to the theater to watch the Original series (Episodes IV-VI), and THOSE are the only true episodes I care to see again, and in their original form. George Lucas has bastardized this series -- his own series -- in a way that degrades their quality and makes them practically unwatchable when you know what really happened (such as Han just taking Greddo out; he's a scoundrel, right?).    When Lucas gets off his throne and really listens to the customers -- the people who lined his pockets -- then and maybe only then will we ever see the original episodes. I doubt that day will ever come. I have given fat-head George enough money over the years (hey, I saw the original Star Wars over 20 times when it was in the theater), and I don't care to buy this crud either.    Good luck, George. When you die, I hope Alfred Hitchcock's waiting to bitch-slap you.
B001TH7GT6|5.0|Looked locally but again, turned to Amazon for this product.  Cable worked great . The TV was older and finding a cable was proving to be difficult. We saw it on Amazon and ordered it.
B000PKLSCE|5.0|This album consists of some of the first work of Elton John and Bernie Taupin.  Really great music and lyrics!  Amazing story behind how these songs came about as well!  You'll find this to be a taste of Elton John that you might not have had the chance to experience if you haven't been introduced to his early recording years.
B00456PKG4|5.0|Based on the Prince Of Persia: The Sands Of Time video game released by UbiSoft, Walt Disney Pictures and Jerry Bruckheimer Filmsstrike gold yet again. They Bring us an action-packed romance where most (if not all) of the stunts are exactly like what you see and do in the video game. Jake Gyllanhaal does a credible English accent and thereby acquits himself very well as Dastan, an orphan boy adopted by the King Of Persia (Ronald Pickup; the BBC miniseries' \\"Fortunes Of War\\" and \\"Sir Walter Scott's Ivanhoe\\"), Gemma Arterton is excellent as Tamina, the Princess whose kingdom has been invaded, and Academy Award winner Sir Ben Kingsley (\\"Gandhi,\\" \\"Schindler's List\\") is terrific as the King's brother who may or may not be what he seems. Very good storyline, and terrific action, comedy and romance. Alfred Molina co-stars. If you loved the video game, you'll love the movie. Should have been rated PG.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|But Dave and the band has DONE IT with Wasting Light. And after seeing their documentary \\"[[ASIN:B004XCUEXY Foo Fighters: Back And Forth [Blu-Ray]]]\\" (also absolutely excellent), I learned they not only recorded one of the greatest rock and roll records in the last two decades, they did it on ANALOG TAPE! These days bands just don't record like this any longer. Technology has gotten to the stage where anyone can record a really good sounding album with very low overhead. Hell, you can do it in your garage and end up sounding just as good as one of the big (LA, NYC, London, etc.) studios. The did it all on tape! Just amazing. For those of you who don't know much about this type of thing, recording to tape is a much more involved process, and a form of art all on its own if you think about it. Sadly, it's nearly lost one at that. In today's recording world, you can fix problems on the fly. Pitch correction, re-amping, , timing issues, etc. can all be fixed just like that. With tape, what you record is what you record. Literally. Sure, you can redo things but it's a whole difference process and can require physically splicing, lining up, and taping pieces of audio tape together. It's tedious at best. But Dave Grohl decided this is the kind of recording/sound he wanted and he got it.<br /><br />They leaned on Producer Butch Vig (who also produced Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\") to handle this album, and from what I can tell from the recordings... they got their money's worth! This album sounds fantastic. I don't wanna get all tape-is-better-than-digital on you here because I honestly can't tell the difference. At least not enough to carry on an intelligent and deep discussion on the topic. I've never been THAT guy. All I can say is it sounds great. Whether that is because it was done on tape or not is beyond me. It just rocks :) Sounding good sonically is one thing, but a 5 star album it does not make! What drives this baby home is the songwriting. Dave has always been a uniquely talented and gifted musician, but I've never been totally blown away by any of his albums as a whole... until now. Sure, he had some great songs, but he's written several so-so tracks as well. THIS album is different. I know opinions are subjective but this is my own. Every single track on this disc is great! Even my 10yr old loves this CD and that's a rare thing for her to get so into the music as much as she has with this album. From the opening harmonics of Bridge Burning to the closing power chords of \\"Walk\\", the album just never lets up. Even throughout the more subdued and dark \\"I Should've Known\\", we're reminded just how powerful the songwriting is on this disc.<br /><br />On the topic of \\"I Should Have Known\\", Nirvana bassist Kristt Novoselic makes an appearance on bass guitar. Stellar performances all around on this track, as with every other. Bob Mould also makes an appearance on vocals for the song \\"Dear Rosemary\\" as well, which is another stand out track. \\"White Limo\\" was the only song on the entire CD that I just didn't care for at first. it just seemed a little out of place in the flow of things, but it's a grower :) If I had to choose some standout tracks on this album (and believe me it's tricky since it's such a stellar recording all the way through), these are my choices, in no particular order. In my opinion, they stand out as the finest songs on the new CD. Bottom line is if you like the Foo Fighters, GET THIS CD NOW!!!<br /><br />  - These days<br />  - Dear Rosemary<br />  - Rope<br />  - I Should Have Known<br />  - Arlandriated and gifted musician, but I've never been totally blown away by any of his albums as a whole... until now.

Bob Mould also makes an appearance on vocals for the song \\"Dear Rosemary\\" as well, which is another stand out track. \\"White Limo\\" was the only song on the entire CD that I just didn't care for at first. it just seemed a little out of place in the flow of things, but it's a grower :) If I had to choose some standout tracks on this album (and believe me it's tricky since it's such a stellar recording all the way through), these are my choices, in no particular order. In my opinion, they stand out as the finest songs on the new CD. Bottom line is if you like the Foo Fighters, GET THIS CD NOW!!!         - These days       - Dear Rosemary       - Rope       - I Should Have Known       - Arlandria
0312330871|4.0|I agree with the other reviews, And Then There Were None IS one of the best mystery novels of the 20th century. It is well written and went into such details that I really got to know each character. Some parts had my hair standing on end, it was that chilling. I highly suggest reading this! Definitely worth it.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|George,     I appreciate your attempt to clean up matte lines, wonky lightsabers, and improve sound and picture quality in your Blu-ray release.    However, I don't understand why you want to make jarring changes to your characters that make once powerful cinematic moments now creepy or distracting.    A lot of people have made the case for Han shooting first (as in the theatrical cut) in Episode IV being a much more interesting and accurate characterization, so I'm not going to touch that.    This review is going to be principally about the changes you made to scenes with me in it.    For instance, in the original cut, when I throw Emperor Palpatine down the death star's reactor shaft, there is a moment of silent deliberation where, oscillating my expressionless masked face back and forth, I decide whether or not to sacrifice my life for the life of my son.  The lack of dialogue allows the viewer to read more subtlety and indecisiveness into this act, and the silence is truer to my character's previous dialogue in films IV-VI.    In this release, you decided to have me scream \\"NO! NOOOOO!\\" at the very beginning of the scene, removing any of the subtlety or conflict, inserting a goofy, lamely comic line not befitting of my badassness, and consequently dulling the emotional significance of a father's redemptive sacrifice of his son.    What's worse, you replace Sebsastian Shaw's peaceful and redeemed ghostly image on endor with Hayden Christiansen's garish, creepy, pedefile-like smirk.      Not only does this not make any sense, because the last time I was alive (on the Light or the Dark side) I looked like Sebastian Shaw, and Obi-Wan and Yoda's ghosts look exactly as they did before they died... but again, Hayden's horrible acting and the visual unevenness of the three actors blunt what could have been a great, emotionally significant scene.    The scene starts great with Mark Hamill's excellent contemplative stare, coupled with peaceful acting from Sir Alec Guinness, but it ends with Hayden Christiansen's disgusting smirk, ruining what was one of the emotional high points and one of the key resolutions of the trilogy.    I keep trying to Skype you - please pick up so I can force choke you and prevent you from making any more changes to your movies.    Sincerely,  Darth Vader

I enjoyed the well acted story that wasn't to over done.  The landscape was beautiful and in keeping of the time period.  I was happy that there was never any lulls in the action.  I would recommend this anyone who wants to enjoy Jane Austin's story about a girl who tries to be a matchmaker and fails and as a result almost misses out on her own match.  Very enjoyable.

B004LWZW4C|5.0|Caution: Mild Spoilers Ahead    Unlike the original \\"X-Men 1\\" movie which I went to watch on the opening weekend, I almost didn't catch \\"X-Men: First Class\\" in the movie theater in time, because it was more of an afterthought on my part, given that \\"X-Men 3\\" and \\"Wolverine\\" were big letdowns. Imagine my surprise when I came out of the movie theater thinking, \\"OMG, that was actually a really good movie.\\"     The core of this movie is the unlikely friendship between two mutants, telepath Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and \\"master of magnetism\\" Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender). The two men couldn't be more different, with Xavier growing up in the lap of luxury while Erik is incarcerated in a Nazi concentration camp being experimented upon by a camp doctor. When we next see the men as adults, Xavier's just received a doctorate from Oxford, and Erik is a globe-trotting Nazi hunter. Their meeting and friendship send both men down paths they don't anticipate, and they end up both making and breaking each other.    Both McAvoy and Fassbender's portrayals propel this movie beyond the average summer action film. Fassbender in particular is gifted in showing a stoic exterior with a palpable sense of rage and pain lurking beneath, and this movie ends up being a tragedy (in a literary sense) with trappings of super powers and cool special effects. Xavier and Magneto's relationship as both friends and enemies has always informed the X-Men comic and movie-verse, and it's great to get a film that focuses on the beginnings of the X-Men and how that relationship came about. If I had a criticism of this aspect of the movie, it's that we really don't get a strong sense of Xavier's side of things. Xavier has a powerful argument to make but doesn't get a chance to make it here. In that sense, this is very much Magneto's movie.    Because the focus is so much on Xavier and Magneto, the other characters end up getting short shrift. The only other relationships in the film that get real attention would be between Charles and his adopted sister and fellow mutant Raven (played beautifully by Jennifer Lawrence), and the twisted revenge-filled relationship between Erik and the tormentor from his youth, Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon). But in a two hour 11 min. movie, it's unfortunately impossible to give everyone as much time as they deserve.    I'd also mention if you're a person for whom canon is important, this film could be problematic. While not officially a reboot, it does directly contradict things from the original four X-Men films. It also does not align with comic-canon (the original X-Men lineup was completely different with the exception of Hank \\"Beast\\" McCoy\\"). But honestly, considering the number of retcons and alternate universes present in the comic canon, I personally think it's more important to tell a good story than to overly worry about canon, given that a goodly chunk of the viewing audience won't know and won't care.
B004EPYZXK|3.0|Was Apollo 17 the last manned lunar project?  Not if you believe the underlying premise of Apollo 18.  I just returned from the theater and talk about a split personality of a movie.<br /><br />Why haven't we been back to the moon?  Because there is life there....and not necessarily friendly live either.  That much is given away in the trailers.  The problem comes in the Blair Witch Project way the film was shot.  Over done at this point for a method of filming a movie.  But that's not even the main problem.  There is also an X-Files element to Apollo 18.  Government \\"conspiracy\\" raises its ugly head in this movie.  I found that to be a bit insulting as a movie goer.  Leave that element out and you have a winner story.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong.  There are quite a few moments that will make you jump in your seat.  The movie also does a good job at delivering a sense of despair and isolation that the main characters must feel in their situation.  Their excitement at landing on the moon gradually turns to fright as the realization of their true situation becomes apparent.  Good job on this front.<br /><br />This could have been an above average flic had the producers/writers avoided the DOD conspiracy aspect.  If you haven't seen Apollo 18 yet see if you don't agree with me after you do.<br /><br />Three stars is all I can give on Apollo 18.
0439023521|3.0|I was captivated by Collin's writing from the first page. She has incredible character and plot development- withholding information and revealing it at just the right time. However once the \\"Games\\" began, the violence was just too much for me. I was thinking about it in the middle of the night and truly disturbed. While the story is unique and compelling, it is not for a young audience. I'm a 25 year old woman and it's too much for me. As much as I have come to love the characters in The Hunger Games, I will not be reading the sequel.

0439023521|5.0|I really enjoyed the Hunger Games trilogy.  The concept of the story is pretty messed up but the characters are engaging and entertaining.  These books are addictive.  I flew right through them!
B005KGPBM6|5.0|How ironic it is that a movie seemingly rooted in religion can be both violent and thrilling? I think Kevin Smith's \\"Red State\\" is a dazzling homage to exploitation film and character study, and it's one that any adult can both appreciate and enjoy. From the opening shot, there's an unsettling, uneven tone that propels the rest of the film along. And there are plenty of twists to surprise the audience.<br /><br />The primary character seems to be Cooper's Dell: a \\"compound\\" is defined as two or more similar substances that can be separated into simpler substances. And Cooper's Dell has a little bit of everything-spiritual hope (in the oddly peaceful scenes within the altar), tension within the population (as characters come and go), and lots of unpredictability. This religious compound is definitely the star, and its' landscape slowly unfolds as we wind our way through its' maze.<br /><br />Two characters that deserve special recognition: Abin Cooper (Michael Parks) is so down-to-earth and sweet-hearted that you might not see the monster behind the eyes. And Special Agent Keenan (John Goodman), while handling much of the film's plot development, still manages to turn out a fine performance, even as the climax subsides. Both men undergo a \\"conversion\\" of sorts--one towards insanity, the other towards enlightenment.<br /><br />If you've followed Kevin Smith on Twitter anytime in the past year, you'll already know that this film is a departure for him. Believe it or not, it's oddly similar to \\"Cop Out\\" (translation: fast, fun, and a complete left-turn). But it does touch close to documentaries like \\"Jesus Camp\\" and (gasp) \\"Waco: The Rules Of Engagement\\", so there's a shred of truth.  It definitely deserves an audience of adults to discuss afterward. If you like what you see after renting \\"Red State\\", the story doesn't stop here. You can search for Kevin Smith's podcasts about the making of the film (Google it!) to learn more.<br /><br />(One note: I watched wirelessly via Roku, renting the HD version. I connected wirelessly @ 7MBps, but was still streaming @ low quality, so you might consider renting the SD version for $1 less if you don't have a speedy connection.)ion.

B005KGPC4S|2.0|Not campy enough to be funny and not smart enough to be thrilling or scary.  I'd say it was trying too hard to be different things if it felt like it was trying at all.  Smith picks an easy target (religious fundamentalists), makes some ham-fisted (and OBVIOUS) observations, and throws in a few jabs at the ATF which felt extremely dated.  There's nothing edgy or new here.  Pedestrian and predictable.    Goodman and Leo are decent as always but the script doesn't give either of them much to do so all we get is one note performances from both.  And Stephen Root, Kevin Pollack and Anna Gunn are completely wasted.  I wasn't exactly looking for nuance in a Kevin Smith movie, but still...  there's a lot of talent here and you want them to do more than run around and yell or get shot in the face.    Ugh - the more I think about it the worse it gets.  Save your money.

B000002L9W|5.0|In this 30 minute workout record, David Lee Roth, Steve Vai, Billy Sheehan, and Gregg Bissonette explore the boundaries of thier indvidual insturments. When I first listened to the record I sensed that all four band members were trying to outdo each other, however, the music flowed extremely well and was entertaining to say the least. Check out Bisonette's drumming on Elephant Gun and Shyboy a true high watermark for the decade. He, unlike Vai and Sheehan, would stay on for Roth's 1988 effort Skyscraper and A Lil Aint Enough, all of which are MUST have albums for any fan of virtuoistic guitar work, with Jason Becker on Enough who was unfortunatly diagnosed with ALS at the age of 20 ending what could have been a brillant career. As always, Roth stayed true to form only working with the top musicians which he continued on Your Filthy Lil Mouth which features Terry Kilgore on guitar who is not nearly as talented as Vai and Becker, but not too shabby either. Being a guitarist myself I was always envious of Roth's ability to work with some of the finest muscians the world of rock has ever known. I have heard a rumor that as of August 2011, a NEW Van Halen album, with Roth, will be released on October 31st? Hopefully this is true as I was too young to ever see the band when I was a kid. Although, I have loved VH since the 1984 album came out. This album, as with ALL Van Halen and Roth albums are a Must Have for ANY guitar player or lover of fine music.

[[ASIN:B002W6Z0UK The Fame Monster]] which had 8 measly tracks was an EP and her best until this strangely inviting album came along. At first after listening to the samples, I wasn't so sure I was gonna love this album because some of the production seemed second rate. The choruses to \\"Judas\\" and \\"Americano\\" weren't helping either as they seemed thrown together. And they are. However, this album is just short of being a masterpiece.

I just get it now.<br /><br />My least favorite track is actually the mix to one of my favorite tracks on the first disc called \\"Schei&szlig;e (DJ White Shadow Mugler)\\" which is on disc 2. Worst track on disc 1 is probably \\"The Edge Of Glory\\" which is just an alright bunch of lyrics slapped to a dance beat. I just don't really think it's a classic like many think. It's OK though.<br /><br />My favorite on the deluxe version by far is \\"Fashion Of His Love\\". I've played this wonderful track as well as \\"Judas\\" the most so far. The former is an all-out 80's dance dream about being insecure about love but at the same time being faithful. There are many references to her late fashion designer Alexander McQueen which the song is also about and dedicated to. Other favorites are the extremely catchy \\"The Queen\\", the infectious \\"Black Jesus + Amen Fashion\\", the ride-or-die anthem \\"You And I\\" (Beyonce might have found inspiration from this one for her mid-tempo \\"Rather Die Young\\") and \\"Judas\\" with its mean beats.<br /><br />Surprisingly, unlike her first album [[ASIN:B001GM28HO The Fame]] there aren't any bad tracks per se, just 2 average ones which were mentioned at the very beginning of this review.<br /><br />Lady Gaga is a fierce force to be reckoned with in the music industry and this album shows that.

You wouldn't know it was a sad song without the lyrics though since its strangely upbeat. The only problem with the song is its chorus which seems like she wrote in 3 minutes. Same thing can be said about Americano's chorus. Well, maybe not. That one seems like it was thrown together in 30 seconds!

B000U55YIS|5.0|So now on to Baccara, When I saw 30th anniversary edition I just thought it was another compilation but when I received it in the mail I was amazed that it was three Cd's with a total of 50 song's WOW!!!! 1st off I love their music and those voices and Spanish accent's very much. Im a sucker for accent's and heavily broken english. When ever I see footage of these 2 gorgeous women I think of Charlie's Angels. When playing this CD, the quality is descent it has good bass witch a lot of older music seems to be lacking. The bass is full but not really deep but it does the job and matches their misc just fine. Their voices are distinct and not muffled the pitch is just right. And most important to me, there is not allot of hiss in the back ground that I seem to be finding in older music. I give the audio quality of this CD 4 stars, it is not going to blow you away with it's audio quality but it is well done for the age of the music and they did a good job on this CD and the disk it self gets 5 stars from me.

B000MG1ZFQ|5.0|Now on to The Soft Parade, I used to own the 1990 version of this CD but it has been lost throughout the years and I just recently bought this version. Jim Morrison has always been one of my favorite musicians since I was around 7 years old and a soon as I was old enough and started to really get into music I went out and bought all of the Door's albums on CD. I have loved them all and cherished them very much. So I put this CD in and was amazed at what I heard!!! It sounded like Jim was in the room with me.... Seriously. I have never heard his voice this distinct and with this much clarity  all the sounds in the music and instruments have such a large sound stage and none of the sounds are mushy or meshed together all interments are very distinct. I can hear every little detail and sound in the music like I have never heard before. Bass is nice deep and full I found myself lowering the bass a bit witch I normally don't have to do with older music or albums usually they lack good bass and punch and have almost no deep bass at all. Hiss is completely absent in the back ground witch is amazing to me since I seem to be finding it alot in older music. And the extra 5 tracks witch I have never heard before are beautifully I love them and find myself playing this CD over and over again starting out with them 1st sometimes. The audio quality of this CD to me rivals most new Cd's. I give the audio quality of this CD 5 stars and the CD it self 5 stars.
0765322889|3.0|This book is great bedtime reading: the plot is interesting enough to kind of want to know what happens, but not interesting enough to keep you up until 2 AM to find out.  The many story lines and plethora of characters are a little hard to keep track of, especially with soul-hopping sorcerers, and after a while I stopped caring; it would have needed a diagram to keep it all straight.  Enjoyable, not fantastic.
B0002EXH40|5.0|No this isn't Peace Sells, or Rust In Peace.  It's not a play as fast as we can album, but that doesn't mean it's not a damn good album.  It's my absolute favorite Megadeth album, and a lot of that is sentiment.   I just started listening to the radio at the time when this was released, so I got to hear a few songs off of it, and had to get it.  This isn't a thrasher, and if you know that going in you'll enjoy it that much more.  This album, like Countdown, focuses more on rhythm, and genuine songwriting, and it works nealry perfectly.  In fact my only real complaint is that there could have been more diversity in the song tempos.  I'd love to have had a couple thrashers, to compliment what's here, but oh well.  No use crying about something that happened over 15 years ago, damn I'm old.       When you consider what they were going for on this one, you have to admit they did a really good job.  They seemed to just want to create an album of good songs, and they did that.  EVERY song on here is solid, with many stand out tracks.  The production is excellent.  Dave turned in one of his best performances of his career, and I was pretty much happy with his vocals from Peace Sells through Countdown, not bad on Killing, but they got better.  The guitars sound good, the drums crisp.  And, hey..  I can actually hear the bass on here.      Reckoning Day 10/10, an upper mid tempo song.  I love the drums in this one.  They have this thunderous quality to them.  The guitar riffs work very well with the drums.  Dave's voice sounds really good, and the melodies, solo, acoutic guitar layering during the solo are all fantastic.  This is a song from my youth, and a Megadeth classic.  Also gotta love the fade out with the drums still thundering in the forefront.    Train Of Consequences 10/10 Love the muted guitar riff.  This is the first Megadeth song I ever heard, and I still love it to this day.  It's a little faster than the first song, not by much.  Again, great melodies.      Addicted To Chaos 9/10 doesn't have the personal connection, well not as much, as the first 2 or the next song would, but it's still a damn good song.  It's a bit slower than the first 2 songs, but it kicks just as much ass.  Well almost i guess since I rated it a point lower.  Love the opening drum beats, give it an epic feel to it.  Love the vocals and the melodies again.  Again very solid guitar playing.    A Tout Le Monde 10/10 why Dave chose to remake this 13 years later is beyond me.  At least the Hanger 18 remake was more a sequal, same song pretty much though.  This is considered a ballad, which is kind of funny to me.  Sure it's softer than most Megadeth songs that came before it, Countdown To Extinction, and Foreclosure Of A Dream being the exceptions.  Love the lyrics.  The French part in the chorus was kind of weird to me at first, but then I was also 15 when I first heard it.  It helps knowing what he's saying.  Love the sound of the acoustic guitars.  This is one of those songs that brings me back to my teenage years, fond memories anyways, and reminds me of a world of new discovery in a way.  I'd just started listening to music, late comer, and there was so much out there, Megadeth, Metallica, Ozzy, Guns N'roses, Van halen, Rush, Alice In Chains, Aerosmith, Zeppelin, Pearl Jam, STP, Soundgarden.  Heck I didn't even learn of Iron Maiden or Dream Theater until a few years later.  More surprises.      Elysian Fields 10/10 this one didn't have the personal connections the 3 singles did, but it's still one of my favorite songs on here  It's an up tempo song.  Love the vocals, should just assume that for every song on here I guess.  Same goes for the melodies, getting tired of writing that, but not listening to them.    The Killing Road 9/10 something about the verses bug me just a little, not even sure what, otherwise I'd give it a perfect score.  Love the chorus.  I guess the guitar riffs don't quite fit the verses as well as they could.  It's another up tempo song.  And it's a really good one.    Blood Of Heroes 9/10 another fantastic song, starts with an acoustic intro.  Soon after it becomes a little more mid tempo of a rocker, than the last couple.  Still a very nice song, love the build up to the chorus.    Family Tree 8/10 starts with an electric guitar intro layered with acoustic guitars, before a drum and bass verse, that later brings in some guitar licks.  I'm not sure if this song's about incest/rape or not, but that's part of the slightly lower grade for me.  Not a big fan of that subject.  Still a very good song I listen to whenever I listen to this album.      Youthanasia 7/10 eh it's a pretty good song.  It's much slower, and has a very slow flow to it.  If that last part makes any sense.  Well I like slow songs, but usually they flow much better than songs with this type of tempo, Alice In Chains used to a little too much on Dirt as well.  Dave sounds like he's got some vocal effect on this one.  Overall it's the slowest song on the album, by far.   Still it's decent, definitely worth listening to, but there was something missing from it.  The instrumental picks up a lot of speed, with some very fast leads.  Again, it's ok, but not the highlight, actually the lowlight of the album, and a pretty good lowlight at that.  Seriously the song's barely over 4 minutes and it feels like 6 or 7 at least.    I Thought I Knew It All 8/10 this little mid tempo rocker seems down right fast after the last song.  It's a solid song, but there really isn't a while lot to say about it.    Black Curtains 8/10 has a different tempo to it, from the rest of the album.  Well part of it dows anyways.  It's kind of slower mid tempo.  Still a very good song, and one I actually knew when I got the album.    Victory 8/10 Probably the fastest song, and they chose to put it last instead of mixing it in, to break things up some.  How many Megadeth song titles from Killing through Countdown, heck you could add Victory since he does say that in the song, can you name?  This song actually has an end of an era feel to it, like the classic Megadeth was done, although we'd get Hidden Treasures which is awesome too.   But, after than the band would never be the same.    Overall this is a very good album.  Those without the personal connection I have to it, may not enjoy it as much, but it's still a very good album that every Megadeth fan should own.  Sure it's not an 80's thrasher, but it's also not the pop  crap they'd later put out.  It's more of a middle of the road album, but it's worth your time to get and listen to it.  Oh I haven't heard the remaster, but I really don't understand why this one was remastered.  It sounds fine on the original.  Get that one if you can, I recommend that with all the 04 remasters.

0307272702|5.0|I've read his other book, \\"Good Calorie, Bad Calorie\\" and it is a handful! It took quite a bit of time to wade thru as it's pretty technical. But \\"Why We Get Fat ...\\" is sorta like the Cliff notes! Very good information in a smaller size. I've been on a ketogenic diet since I started reading \\"GCBC\\" and I'm down just about 30 lbs. And my bloodwork is very good.  I highly recommend this book, BUT, I ride a bike quite a bit and this mode of eating has made it harder to ride long distances.
B003L20ICE|2.0|The actors are great, but what's up with the writer-director?  Is she trying to say \\"I don't really want to be mean, but ...\\"<br /><br />(a) I can't help it, I'm an American.  (I loved the review that explained how the French would have handled the plot's conflict!)<br />(b) Hollywood makes me do it.<br />(c) The movie-going public makes me do it.<br /><br />Anyway, the film as much as says it's intended to be conventional, so it must have a moral, right?  Let's see, that would be \\"Sex is bad for you -- no matter what your gender, orientation, or state of confusion -- because you might become a mature, warm, happy person and it has no place in marriage.  Oh, and you might have orgasm.\\"<br /><br />One good thing about public art that totally misfires as this film does, is that it elicits good, negative feedback from the rational fringe.  Although I don't really keep count, I feel like I read more perceptive, informative Amazon.com reviews of this film than of practically any other product I've looked into.  These reviews are nearly all in the one- and two-stars columns, and I'm happy to be in their company.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|Dear George,    Stop tampering with timeless classics. We appreciated the hi-def VHS back in 1995. We tolerated the CGI extras in 1997. We gagged on your prequels, and wretched at your DVD edits (Hayden at the end of ROTJ, seriously?) and now these blu-ray hacks (and that is what they are, hacked-apart masterpieces) will succeed in turning even the most loyal fans against your blatant profiteering and utter callousness.    But hey, your George Lucas. People will buy whatever trash and cheesy merchandise you churn out. I should have hoped that South Park episode would have taught you a lesson a few years ago. Which timeless classic are you going to edit-into-ruin next?
B004XWLN20|4.0|...But if you look at it at the DVD set that it's intended to be, it sounds like it should be a really nice package. An episode guide will be included with production art and behind the scenes photo's, as well as the Daily Planet special looking at some of their biggest storylines over the years. And a 90-minute series retrospective is nothing to be sneezed at, ditto getting to see the 2010 Comic Con panel. The Superboy pilot doesn't interest me in the slighest I will admit, but apparently this set will include the Aquaman pilot starring Justin Hartley. I'm surprised that hasn't been used more as a selling point, instead of some failed pilot from the 60's LOL. By all accounts the pilot for Aquaman actually showed a lot of promise, and it will be interesting for Smallville fans to see Justin in that role so that extra I am really looking forward too. The packaging looks nice as well, so I think people are being a bit unfair and nitpickety to leave reviews acting like this whole release is just thrown-together carelessly unless it consists of blu-ray. It's pretty clear they've put a lot of thought into it    Of course I would rather this collection be available in blu-ray, but that hardly makes the DVD deserving of 1 star. I'm really looking forward to a complete series rewatch. In my opinion the best seasons are seasons 1, 3, 5, 6, and 8. And the worst for me were probably seasons 4, 7 and 9. But hey nearly every season still has something to recommend it. I probably wouldn't have brought it for the original price, but for around $200 I'd say it's a pretty sweet deal when you consider that there's enough content here (10 years of Smallville!) to keep most fans busy for a very look time
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Claire Danes does a fantastic job portraying Temple Grandin, a high-functioning autistic woman. Julia Ormond (mother) and Catherine O'Hara (aunt) add wonderfully to the mix, with characters that are challenged by Temple yet do whatever is needed to provide her a life worth living.<br /><br />And it is a life worth living...we see a 4-year old girl unable to talk grow into a highly-educated woman. Temple Grandin deals with bullying, teasing, prejudice and ignorance. She struggles to interpret social cues. She has difficulty relating to people. However, she also has an uncanny talent for interpreting patterns, a keen mind and a drive to succeed. Her story, and this movie, is an uplifting look at a person who capitalizes on her differences and achieves.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Star Wars was a groundbreaking film.  Not the best young cast ever, but a truly revolutionary piece of storytelling.    It's been over 30 years since, and George Lucas can't stop screwing with it.  I was 11 when \\"A New Hope\\" was released, and I saw it over 50 times over the following months.  But it's not the same movie any more.  He's not just screwing with his film - he's trying to re-write the past with a broad brush, marginalizing all the brilliant strokes in the original release.  He's worth billions - as a \\"job creator\\", he should be willing to spend a million or two, clean up the original releases with 4K scans, and do his myriad of fans a huge favor.    Pre-order cancelled.  I'm just hoping someday the original will be re-released, as I so vividly remember it.
B004EI3ON4|5.0|Oh my god.  I have watched Tron three times, and I loved the soundtrack each time.  Only now (when the price dropped to $5 - FINALLY), have I decided to buy the soundtrack.  It is absolutely stunning.<br /><br />My other favorite soundtrack is John Powell's Bourne Identity soundtrack.  I've always felt like it puts me in the movie without having to watch it.  It's a motivational force that helps me complete projects, push through rough times, and more.  The Tron soundtrack does the same thing... but possibly even better.<br /><br />I have only heard one or two Daft Punk songs, so I haven't had hardly any previous exposure to their style, but after hearing this album, I'm going to dig deep into their archives.<br /><br />This album is ridiculously good.  If you're on the fence whatsoever about buying it, come on in, the water's more than fine.  This soundtrack has character like almost no others do.  This is one for the history books.

B004RSCWZ2|5.0|I heard the song \\"Midnight in Harlem\\" and knew I had to have this CD. Susan Tedeschi has such a beautiful voice and the slide guitar riffs bring me back to my memories of the Allman Brothers Band. The former Derek Trucks Band is much much better as the Tedeschi Trucks Band!
030788743X|5.0|Ready player One posits a dystopian future America, not so dissimilar from our present, in which forty years of recession, environmental depletion and energy scarcity have made life in an elaborate virtual reality system far preferable to life in reality itself. This virtual reality system, called the OASIS, is free to all as guaranteed by its inventor -- a sort of Bill Gates-like uber nerd/super genius named James Halliday.<br /><br />The conceit: Halliday dies, leaving his entire fortune to the first person to find a hidden \\"easter egg\\" planted somewhere in the OASIS. The conflict: pleasant, good-hearted people like main protagonist and high school student Wade Watts are searching for the egg, but so is heartless mega-corporation \\"IOI\\" who, if it finds the egg will convert the largely egalitarian and free OASIS into a commercial nightmare, fraught with barriers to all but the most privileged users. Can Wade and his friends find the egg before the evil IOI and its extraordinarily well-funded minions? Sounds hokey? My description might but rest assured that the story's not. This is a ripping yarn.<br /><br />As others have observed, this book rewards you if you're a child of the 1980s. Why? Because the deceased James Halliday, a man who is described as never having had an intimate relationship and was painfully uncomfortable in social situations, instead formed a deep bond with the pop culture of his youth. He had the highest regard for those who shared his picayune obsessions and nothing but scorn for those who didn't. Consequently, it turns out that the egg hunters (or \\"gunters\\" as their called) must have the same arcane knowledge of 80s science fiction films, video games, music and TV shows to be successful. Each stage of the egg hunt relies on a deep knowledge of each.<br /><br />This is, of course, a nerd dream. Finally, being able to recite every line of Monty Python and Holy Grail from memory could be rewarded with the greatest monetary pay-off in world history. Thought all of that time spent memorizing the Star Wars films, the songs of Rush and playing Joust at the local video arcade was a waste? Well, not in this world it wasn't!<br /><br />In addition to being a good \\"quest\\" story with likeable and clever characters, author Cline explores the interesting side-effects of a culture living primarily as avatars in a virtual reality world. In the OASIS, you never know who you're really interacting with. Is that female avatar you're talking to really female? Are they really 18 years old? Or is it some old guy named Chuck? What happens when you can't make any assumptions about anyone? None of the normal rules apply. It's not a new examination of the topic, but it's a well-handled one.<br /><br />Then, there's the imagined world itself. Cline has a knack for making you feel as if you're as fully immersed in the OASIS as the main characters themselves. And the OASIS is interesting. It's as big as the universe where any rule that can be imagined can exist. There are zones where rules of magic apply, zones where only technology can be used, zones where both exist, zones where neither exist and zones where players cannot engage in combat with one another. It's a mash-up of fantasy, science fiction and a few other genres all in one big bag.<br /><br />About half way through the book, I got the feeling that Ready Player One might actually be considered YA fiction. I double checked the Amazon listing and found that it wasn't. At least not officially. What that tells me is that this is a book which should have wide appeal. There's more than enough to keep a younger reader hooked and there's plenty for us old 40-somethings too. Go out and get a copy of this book and enjoy running through the OASIS searching for the egg.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|It steals their ideological thunder, just like selected other worthwhile literature, including another George.  (Orwell....)    For people who want to go political, I'll just refer you to Leo Strauss' \\"Dangerous Truths vs. Noble Lies\\" dogmatic obsessions, please drop it there as the title is just an attention getter.  I know it's open to debate.  Look on the bright side, at least it reinforces a work ethic for the young......      I don't especially care about the \\"Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!\\".  Would I have left it out?  Yes.  Does it ruin the narrative?  Not really.  It's just a storyline that had its sights set low to begin with as an hommage to Saturday morning matinee serials. To the naysayers, I say get a hold of yourselves.....    There's more than a smidgen of the Bible in these allegories (just to tick off Theocrats) as well as world history.  This is something that the franchise owes (along with a pile of other inspirations not given proper credit) to the so called \\"liberalisms\\" Star Trek.  Do I live, eat and breathe either?      \\"Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!\\"    It's pleasant fiction that has positive messages set in a kid friendly format.  There are worse manifest destinies.  Just ask ole' Luke Whathisname.......    Buy it and pray that it's the last version you'll be snookered into owning.

B00308SOA2|3.0|Meryl Streep was amazing, I truly felt that Julia was alive and in front of me, but then again, that woman could read a phone book and make it sound like Hamlet. On the other side... Gosh, Amy Adams played a role of a very annoying histerical girl and it was just too much for my taste.     Let's be honest here, we all saw this film because it was about Julia Child, her life filled with passion, not because someone wanted to learn to cook by trying all the recipes in her cookbook. It is too bad that we will now never have a film about Julia and only Julia (and fantastic Meryl in it).

I have not read through all the reviews of this DVD yet.

B001PPLIEG|4.0|This may not be up there with CASINO ROYALE and SKYFALL but for me is a good Bond in todays world of corporate control of the planets natural resourses. Marc Forster has made the shortest running time Bond but has put a lot of complex technical work in the film. It is basically a raw, visceral action film on land, water, air and fire.<br /><br />The film deals in todays politics where corporations are willing to deal with the Left or Right as long as they get their interests. The West is prepared to tolerate corporations in removing Governments who refuse to give corporations their cut. Daniel Craig for me is the definitive Bond. He seems like a real spy where previous Bonds relied on silly cartoon action and writing. Craig is a complicated Bond and in SKYFALL admitted to using homosexuality in achieving his goals for God and Country. I doubt previous Bonds would have accepted the ploy of homosexuality in their missions.<br /><br />My only problem with QUANTUM OF SOLACE was not enough satisfying expostion on the Quantum organisation and Mr White was the only dubious villian to get away. Will Mr White be seen in the next 2 SKYFALL sequels? Like I said this is a lesser Bond to Craigs other Bonds but is better the most earlier Bonds.

067182449X|3.0|I read this book as a kid and found it good enough but more of just a kids book. From my understanding, this is Otto Franks edited version in which he pics and snips through the different versions of Anne's diaries. He makes her seem much more childish than the original diaries do. Anne went back and edited her diaries in hopes of being published after the war. Try reading the Definitive edition or if you can find another. Anne Frank was a much better writer than she is given credit for and this edition is more like Illustrated Classics version instead of the real diary.
0307716511|5.0|Last summer's theme appeared to be books about adultery. This summer it's all about sisters.  The \\"Weird Sisters\\", the \\"Bird Sisters\\" and now \\"Sister\\".  All three are outstanding, however, I saved the best for last. This book is for everybody. Readers of the suspense genre, readers who appreciate well developed characters, readers who appreciate an unpredictable plot and a never saw it coming ending. For me it was also a 318 page love story to and about family, and the hope that it is never to late to right a wrong. A breakout first novel.  My favorite of the year so far.
B0000VD04M|5.0|Johnny Depp stars as Ed Wood, arguably the worst movie director of all time, in this amusing and at times, touching story of Ed's career in the fifties.  Ed was an unparalleled optimist, enamored with movie-making; he possessed little talent, expertise, or money, but he and his little group of pals made cheap and very bad horror/sci-fi movies and loved it.  The only star he ever worked with was Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau), decades after his success as 'Dracula,' now drug-addicted and in failing health.  Wood and Lugosi made several films together, the most (in)famous being, \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space,\\" which was actually made after Lugosi's death.<br /><br />Depp is extremely likable and sympathetic as the effervescent Wood.  His quirky, driven personality and penchant for wearing angora sweaters seem entirely believable.  Landau won a Best Supporting Oscar for his portrayal of the washed-up Lugosi; he's pathetic and grotesque and absolutely mesmerizing.  Watching Ed throw together a whole movie in a few days is hilarious.  For Ed, quality was in the mind of the beholder and he loved his movies.<br /><br />This is a sweet, amusing, lightweight tale about a fascinating Hollywood character that may inspire you to see some of his movies.  Recommended.

On the thought of killing half of China's population, Mao claimed that half of China's population had been killed several times before.To a person who's never read about Mao, this book is beyond reproach.Mao and Stalin, to use the authors phrase, \\"died in (their) beds\\".Is the Earth hell?

In addition to the live performance, this cd also includes small bonus clips featuring the band backstage prior to hitting the main stage at various other concerts around the world.<br />The second cd included is an audio cd consisting of 11 unreleased tracks, including the Avenged Sevenfold version of Pantera's \\"Walk\\".<br />Great purchase! Will NOT disappoint!
B004V7XWEE|5.0|Had to return product because it was a duplicate, and vendor responded immediately. Will definitely buy something else in the future.
B001608QVS|5.0|This is a fantastic collection...all the Dirty Harry classics in one beautiful box set, with very cool production notes booklet and of course that outstanding Blu-ray picture quality. Highly recommended.
1594744769|2.0|I dove into this book excited about the possibilities. But within 24 hours and mid-way through I was left with a sour taste in my mouth. I did not like the main character. I did not like his family. I did not like the \\"peculiar children\\"... I wanted it to end. I was bored. My expectations were far from being met.<br /><br />I have never met a more boring, spoiled, un-remarkable character in all the fiction I have ever read. And how fitting that his little escapade to the UK could so easily come to pass, seeing as his family was bloody rich and had greens to blow. Yawn. I did not believe that his \\"relationship\\" with his grandfather could have been all that great. It didn't really seem like the kid cared much about anything... I was bored before he even met the little ghostly kids. And they didn't even do much to make the story more interesting. What was the point of the whole story when most that is \\"revelations\\" that come about in the end were things you already knew from the very beginning anyway?<br /><br />Yes, a grossly overhyped story, indeed.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|This is just a really original idea for a dark comedy. I love the dialogue, and the relationships between the characters trying to survive such a horrible crisis. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are perfect together as always.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|DEAR GEORGE LUCAS,    I wanted this Blu-Ray set more than anything. Hi-def original trilogy?! SIGN ME UP!    But no. Beyond Greedo shooting first. Beyond crappy CG Jabba. Beyond abysmal ROTJ Musical number. Beyond three mediocre-to-awful prequels. Beyond insertion of Hayden Christiansen. Beyond the solar-ring Death Star explosions.    You added crap that looks and sounds like a 6 year old's youtube fan edit, George.    To quote an old friend of yours, \\"George, you can type this s***, but you sure as hell can't say it.\\" Harrison Ford was referring to your script, but the same definitely goes for your newest additions.    I wish you liked the original films as much as I do... or did, anyway. They didn't need this kind of facelift. People love them for the stories, the characters, the action, the comedy. Han Solo the badass, Luke the noble Knight. Lando the token character, but still COOLEST man in the galaxy. The powerful, emotionally charged lightsaber battles. The space wars. THIS IS WHAT WE LOVE, AND WE LOVED IT SINCE THE BEGINNING.    But you obviously hate the originals. Why else would you inject these juvenile changes? We were already disheartened by the \\"enhancements\\" in 1997, then in 2004 for the DVDs. Now, you've lost me as a fan.    I wouldn't have minded the deleted scenes, and will probably watch them and them alone at some point. But you did a disservice not just to fans, but to the films that made you who you are. Most people would have respected that.    I will not buy this set, and have cancelled my preorder. I will either have to pirate the ORIGINAL-original somehow or simply let the films remain untarnished in my memories.    Goodbye, Star Wars. It was good while it lasted.
B0007G89G4|4.0|I've loved this movie since the first time I saw it...what's cooler than a group of buds heading out on a road trip (unless it's also to hunt down a body)? Great acting from all the kids, nicely directed.
B0053F042G|5.0|The plot holds back information from not only the main character, but from the audience.  The cool thing about the development of Gyllenhal's character is that he has an intuitive intelligence that tends to better his situation and his apparent fate.  Not just an action-adventure film, but a thought-provoking journey in quantum mechanics and ethics.  Nicely done.
B00005JPMZ|5.0|This game keeps my son challenged.  He is now in love with the classic TMNT that I watched as a kid.  It's great for an old time classic to still be current today.  I have definitely got my monies worth out of this one.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  It made me think of JC Dugard.  It's unimaginable that things like this happen.  It's written beautifully and you can hear the child's voice. I found it happy, sad and scary.  Worth the read.
B004UQPM4E|1.0|You have to buy EVERY superman movie? Including 3, 4, and Returns, which are terrible?    That's really sad. The Theatrical Cut of Superman is an iconic classic, but the extra stuff that Donner added (the cheesy Lois Lane jokes, the lame \\"action\\" sequence at Luthor's lair) really detract from the original.    Sometimes cuts are good cuts.    Now, you CAN'T get the original theatrical cut of Superman, unless you have an old Laser Disc player. The original cut was BETTER. Better flow, less stiff bad jokes, and act three really cooked.    I will NOT buy all of these terrible superman films, just to get that original Superman cut. I'll wait.
B0037TRVHQ|5.0|This is a fine collection / sampler of music from the Linn Records catalog.  Six of the fifteen selections are popular music and the remaining nine are classical.  Once gets nearly fifty-five minutes of interesting music by a variety of artists recorded in audiophile quality sound.  The sound is indeed superb whether listening in 5.1 SACD surround, two-channel SACD or ordinary two-channel stereo on the CD layer.  The surround sound tends to be more of the \\"ambience\\" style were the main sound is located in the front soundstage and the surrounds add a feeling of the room.      I highly recommend this disc and the whole series of Linn SACD samplers to audiophiles and/or music lovers.
