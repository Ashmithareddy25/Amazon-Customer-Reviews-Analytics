B0046B8GEQ|4.0|I thought the movie was very nice in that it had a great balance of warm moments with comedic moments and a bit of crude or harsh humor.  In all, it was a good family movie that championed the values of love and family.
B007REV4YI|5.0|lots of action. a great addition to our Bond collection. I would definately recommend this movie to anyone who likes action films.

B0050PYNO4|4.0|This was a funny movie,however, i would not recommend this film to anyone under the age of 13, because of the nature of it.

B00BEPVAV8|4.0|The fun, childlike graphics and colorful scenery make for a great game. It's the kind of game you can't play only one round of.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I love games where you get to build parks and such. This is one of the best ones I  have found for the Kindle Fire. There is money you can buy with real money but if you aren't impatient the dinosaurs make money pretty fast. I love it

B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Oz the movie was awesome and now thers a new game to match I just have to say that temple run people have out done themselves
B0036OODFU|5.0|I love this movie!  This has become my favorite movie!  In fact, Rolling Stone magazine brought me here.  I love the music in it and I love that it is all about the music.<br /><br />I am an avid reader of Rolling Stone magazine and often check their website--by often I mean everyday--and saw one of their lists.  The list was the Top Thirty Rock 'N' Roll Movies, and Almost Famous was number three.  I then saw another list entitled, Top Ten Music Movie Moments at number eleven with the &#34;Tiny Dancer&#34; scene.  After reading about it, it made me really want to see it.  So, I can really say that, Rolling Stone magazine made me want to see it.<br /><br />The movie is about fifteen-year-old, William Miller (Patrick Fugit), who is an aspiring music journalist, and lives with his overprotective mother.  William starts out covering a Black Sabbath concert for Creem magazine, asigned to him by editor and mentor, Lester Bangs, when he meets Penny Lane (Kate Hudson) and &#34;Band Aids&#34; (a.k.a. groupies who care about music) and the up-and-coming band, Stillwater.  William covers the concert and interviews the band, when a few days later, he is called up by Rolling Stone to do a editorial on the band.  William ends up going on tour with Stillwater, as well as Penny Lane and the rest of the Band Aids, and witnesses the ups and the downs of this up-and-coming rock band.<br /><br />This movie has by far become one of my all-time favorite movies.  I love the story--and how it's pretty much a fictionalized memoir of writer/director Cameron Crowe's experiance of writing for Rolling Stone when he was seventeen--I really enjoy it everytime I watch it.  I have literally watched it everyday for a week, or two (but who's counting?).  It's a must-see for any music or Rolling Stone fans, even for future journalists.  I loved it so much, that I downloaded it on my Kindle (which is something I don't normally do, if that says anything).<br /><br />The only thing I would say bad aboutit is, is there are some questions about some of the characters that could've been answered (like, Penny Lane for example, what made her become a Band Aide, those kinds of questions), which from my understanding, is answered in the &#34;Untitiled&#34; Bootleg edition (I only have the regular DVD and Amazon Digital Download).<br /><br />I hope my review was helpful, and made you want to see it, like Rolling Stone did for me.  This is a must see, and you will not be wasting your money, it's worth it!  Rock on!
B0089LOKHG|3.0|This book was supposed to lead up to a big bang, and I was o.k. with the ending, I just expected a lot more.
B00AQM7T74|5.0|this is a cool steel book really god art work out side and inside as well if u like the movie and collecting steel books this one is a must get!!!!!
B00A9V2JSG|3.0|This is my favorite of the three books.  I am positive that the three could have been combined into one book though.  Just seemed like it had too much fluff, and not enough meat and potatoes.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Great movie, although I have to watch it in 2D blu-ray because my 3D TV and my 3D glasses (Sony) add up to often seeing fuzzy-double-vision scenes. I don't think it is the fault of the movie disc, I think it is my year-old 3D Sony TV or my Sony 3D glasses or my new Sony 3D Blu-ray player. hmmmm..... I've tried everything, but it just is fuzzy on every third or fourth scene. I think the 2D is fantastic, but I will leave 3D for the big screen theatres.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book so much more than the first (bared to you).  I want more, don't make me wait.... please?!

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Good story line. Great character development, a real page turner.  I would recommend this book.  It deals with some very painful subjects but is very well written.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I wouldn't ready nearly as much if it wasn't for this app.  I can open my books anywhere I want and not have to rely on having my kindle in hand.
B00BWJARHO|2.0|The book is a classic. This movie is not.  Too much made-up baloney straight from the lower intestine of Peter Jackson.  It's all done up nicely with special effects and the acting is good.  But there are too many unnecessary changes from the book.
B00846REIS|4.0|This was too short for me!  I liked it, but I felt it was a little thin in the story line.  I just hoped that the second book would make up for it and it did!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was extremely disappointed. It was an easy read & it held my interest but I HATED the ending.<br />I
B005MMJ84K|3.0|Delirium and Pandemonium could have been one book.  Too much fluffy stuff that filled pages rather than grit.  I caught my self skipping pages.

014312093X|1.0|John Le Carrë's Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy may be the most boring book I have ever forced myself to finish. Indeed, there were passages where I literally fell asleep every two to three pages. Altogether, the nod-off count had to approach a hundred. Now, this is not to say that it is the most boring book I have ever picked up. But those that beat it out I put down at some point and never finished.<br />Several factors combine to give it such a high sleep inducement quotient. First, there is Le Carrë's writing style, which can be most kindly described as difficult. Long, convoluted sentences combine to make long, dense paragraphs. And at the end of many of them you feel like you need to go back and read it again because you are not sure what it said. After doing that over and over, you begin to realize that the writing is purposely thick and obscure.<br />Next are the characters. Le Carrë introduces dozens of them, often without explanation as to who they are or what role they play, leaving it to the reader to piece it together based upon the conversation and context. Moreover, most of them are far from vivid. As a result, they are imminently forgettable and when you next run into them it is quite a challenge to remember who they are. George Smiley, the story's protagonist, is short, fat and bald, allows himself to be cuckolded, and seems to have absolutely no enthusiasm for work or anything else in life. In other words, he is purposely boring. And he is the most interesting character in the book.<br />Then there is manner in which the action unfolds. Granted, this in no action thriller and does not intend to be. That's fine; I don't need a fight scene, chase scene or killing in every chapter. So this is not a complaint that it is not a modern action movie put to the page. But to the extent that there is action, or perhaps I should say activity, it is told in Chekhovian style. That is, the action takes place \\"off stage\\" and is then later discussed or related by one of the characters who was involved. This saps the narrative of any sense of immediacy and infuses it with tedious passivity.<br />Finally, there is Le Carrë's extreme dedication to realism. Now, don't get me wrong, realism as it is generally practiced is all well and good. But most \\"realistic\\" authors, such as Hammett and Hamilton, realize that narrative fiction cannot be one hundred percent realistic without becoming an incredible bore. Many compelling legal thrillers and dramas have been written over the years. But as an attorney, I can attest that if they described the practice of law in all of its truly realistic detail, not many books or tickets would be sold. There is nothing very exciting about wading through thousands of pages of discovery responses in search of useful tidbits. Yet Le Carrë does the intelligence agency equivalent of just that, devoting chapter after chapter to file reviews.<br />So what did stop me from putting this book down? Much of it was reputation. It is such a well- known and highly regarded work that I kept expecting a big payoff. That never came. Also, because of its reputation, I thought that as a student of the genre I owed it to myself to get the book under my belt. But in fairness to the author, the basic plot − uncovering a high level mole in the British intelligence agency - is compelling. The book reads like a whodunit and the desire to learn the identity of the culprit did keep me going. Unfortunately, the answer was the obvious one and the revelation was as quiet and understated as the rest of the book.<br />So, read this book if you must. But keep your pillow close at hand.<br /><br />SecretAgentFanForum.blogspot.comne of the characters who was involved.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|Super happy with the ending!  I am among the millions of women that can't wait until the movie gets under production, and see who is cast as Mr. Grey.... although there is a lot of speculation already.
B003Y5H574|5.0|Watched it 10 times, always funny. Showed it to a bunch of family at different times. Shipment came fast too!
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|Again, I really liked this story.  However, there were times that I caught myself skipping paragraphs because it seemed worthless to read.
B005HSL626|4.0|Good game that you don't have to think to hard to play.  I like that there are a few different options of playing.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Everything I expected from Stana Katic. A very touching and shaking experience. Only the two episodes ending Season Five were better in that Castle's father was better - and I actually shed a tear! Even the Bourne series couldn't compare to this!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|You got to love angry birds.  Entertaining,  Different options for games.  Wish I were better at it but that doesn't seem to happen.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|The actors did such a good, BELIEVABLE  job  - especially Stana Katic. It did not change any of my opinion of her acting abilities, but made them stronger if anything. I could not wait for the next season to begin to see the carry-over acting! Couldn't wait too, to see where it went from there.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|I wish amazon had more music choices.  Several songs I looked for were not available. I like that daily deals.
0140544518|5.0|I had this book when I was younger and my son, who is 3 was getting into the big bad wolf.  So, I ordered this book and he loves it just as much as I did!
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|The movie is fantastic.  The kids loved it and so did we.  Unfortunately, this is now the second movie in a row that we streamed from Amazon that buffered.  This movie buffered two times and after the second time the video quality was very grainy.  Usually, when this happens after a minute or so the quality comes back.  I am really starting to re-think streaming videos through Amazon.  Redbox and Netflix are starting to look good again.  At this point, I might stop paying for Amazon Prime.
B008N1V11U|5.0|I played this game from start to finish and the graphics are great the combat is unbelievably awsome make not batman games like this please :) this game is worth the money you buy it with
B004T4KQJS|5.0|I started reading it for the second time by accident. My Kindle opened it for me when I thought I was reading another recent purchase and the two seamlessly co-joined for a chapter before I realised my mistake. I found it too interesting to put it down however so I am reading it for the second time and enjoying it even more.
B008GXHOFW|3.0|It's nice but sometimes the web slinging is kinda egy but the missions are a good challenge :) although the combat is bad ass
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This movie was great. It had comedy and family values.  Not only did it make me laugh, but I even teared up a bit.
B000002J03|5.0|My mom loves it.. She listens to it alot.. She really loves Thank You.. My dads song to her..I just love them in general..
B000AGTPUU|4.0|I seen this movie on tv and I like it and thought I would like to have it so I bought the dvd.Good movie for the kids to.
B005NA3B8U|5.0|This game is one of the best 2D shooters out there.  Now it works for the Kindle Fire HD 8.9!  I like that you can either control the ship by touch or by using a simulated control pad.  More and more games are doing this on the touch screen and allows for very precise control just by using your finger or stylus to move the ship. Auto fire is on unless you touch and hold the charge for a mega blast. I got as far as the boss on the fourth level and love it that you can continue the level where you left off once you get there without starting from level one.  For 99 cents, nostalgic awesomeness is available for the Kindle Fire HD 8.9.
B001NLL93W|5.0|This book keeps you in suspense. The couple last chapters are the best and I'm ready to read the next book!
B000W93CHC|5.0|There is something for all readers, men and women and tor those that like history and learning what life was like hundreds of years ago.
B005JR4K28|5.0|One of the most sm a rtest and funniest comedies in a long time. Top of my guilty pleasures list.
B0034G4P4O|3.0|OK for kids but slow for adults.  We gave it to our grand kids and their kids to keep.  GM
B009GX6TMA|5.0|The new episodes are just the best, I love that Nick and Jess are going to the next level and it was surprising that it was not even in the endof the season.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I love reading the adventures of Tom Sawyer. It takes you away to a fun time and all of the adventures he enjoyed. So glad to be able to read this as an adult and enjoy it.
B0049U4NQO|5.0|This book was AMAZINGLY AWESOME! With twists and turns, the action never stops. I definitely suggest reading it. Anthony Horowitz has done it again.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love this series, quality program. My office co-workers are addicted.  We can't wait to catc up to current season. Fabulous.
B00A8KJK7G|4.0|Victor loves his dog. I mean, what kid doesn't? They do everything together --- from science projects to making homemade horror movies--- they are the very best of friends. But one tragic day, all that will change. After Sparky's untimely death, Victor immerses himself in his schoolwork, taking a particular fascination in the sciences. Inspired by one of his eccentric teacher's electric lessons, Victor decides to test his theories the only way he knows how--- by trial and error with gruesome experimentation. And what do you know? It actually works! He's alive! He's really alive! There's just one problem now that Sparky's back... how do you make people accept what they don't understand? Victor and Sparky are challenged to prove that despite his terrifying looks, Sparky is still the loyal pal he's always been. And behind-the-scenes, unbeknownst to them both, there are more sinister forces that want to wreak monstrous havoc to the town. Can Victor and his undead friend stay in tact long enough to save the day?<br /><br />I am an unabashed fan of Tim Burton's movies. Big Fish, The Corpse Bride, Edward Scissorhands, The Nighmare Before Christmas --- all works of cinematic art. I'm here to tell you that Frankenweenie is no exception. Pretty much, the man is a genius, especially when it comes to animation. For all the limitations that animated movies have to offer, Burton excels at creating an essence of creepy originality and gothic creativity. You'll find that Frankenweenie is much inspired by some of the more classic horror films, only its told in a more kid-friendly manner. That's not to say that the movie is completely age-appropriate (it does delve into death, afterall), but Burton does a decent job of dealing with the more serious issues in a darkly humourous way.<br /><br />What I really love is that Burton wasn't afraid to examine his debut short and re-imagine it into this grandiose and ultimately captivating film. I will admit, at times there are those familiar echoes, script-wise, but it's touched by Burton's unusual eccentricity which keeps it from feeling too monotonous. In it you'll find the usual cast of characters, of course---the social misfit with a good heart, the quietly weird girl, the eccentric sidekick and the dastardly villain--- but what makes the film so unique is the addition of Victor's loveable, yet horrifying dog. Seriously, the reanimated Sparky will steal your heart with his adorable mannerisms and gruesome quirks. There were two key moments where I had tears in my eyes. I guess if I had one big criticism of the film, it's that there wasn't enough characterization into Victor. Frankenweenie barely scratches the surface on questioning his actions which renders the plot as somewhat hollow.<br /><br />The voicework was outstanding, featuring the return of several Burton alums and the music is eerie perfection. I loved the dark atmosphere of the stop-motion which adds layers to the story's creepiness. And perhaps even more remarkable is subtle homage to films of horror movie's past. If you look closely enough, you'll also find some clever referencers to Burton's other cinematic achievements. Though I wouldn't say Frankenweenie was my favourite Burton film, I found the ending be a bit too empty, it still found a place in my heart with it's quirky charm and extraordinary vision. At best, I felt some of the feels and was very happy for my own fuzzy canine friend!<br /><br />Food for Thought: Frankenweenie is basically, you know, Frankenstein but for kids (sorta). The story might be just as ugly as the original, but its definitely not lacking in heart .Featuring some stellar voice talents, remarkable animation and one very cute puppy, this film is a winner for families and those that share a mutual appreciation for classic horror. Not quite a masterpiece, but still a wonderful achievement for one of my favourite directors.echoes, script-wise, but it's touched by Burton's unusual eccentricity which keeps it from feeling too monotonous.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|really fun. I don't really play games. But I really like to play this one. I wish the horses would cost less though.
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|I loved this movie start to finish and the music is heavenly! I do think that the casting people made a terrible mistake having Russell Crowe in such an important part. While his acting was good, he cannot sing and many of his songs were key to the story. He took the film from a 5 star rating to a 4 star one.  The landlord and his wife were so badly cast that you could not understand the words of the songs they sang. If someone didn't know the lyrics beforehand, you just had to guess what was happening. The direction and editing caused the film to feel choppy. We needed to be moved through the years smoothly and cohesively. Therefore Tom Hooper was not nominated for best director. BUT this music is so fabulous that we are transported by Hugh Jackman and the rest of the cast to another time and place and my tears flowed and I sat motionless for the entire 2 hours and 40 minutes. Bravo!
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This review was made on march 24 2013<br />This is listed to make sure you see the time it was made in so incase the dates get messed up or anything you can see when it was posted<br />updates may pop up after this review but the review will stay the same.<br />Now lets start the review<br /><br />Notebooks may come expensive. why buy them when you can get them all free?<br /><br />The app simple and easy to use app called notebooks is what you can use to make easy notes and get them free.<br /><br />Lets give you all a lesson on how to use the app Notebooks<br /><br />- on the right side of the screen of when you open the app Notebooks, there should be a sign that is a + addition symbols, click it to make a digitle notebook<br /><br />-when making a notebook, there should be a tab that says title, put your title there<br /><br />-there should also be a tab that shows ..., click it to change the notebook cover<br /><br />- the bottom tab should be the number of pages the notebook you making should have ( I don't know the limit of pages allowed to each notebook but I think it is all you want but the more pages, the more memory will be taken up )<br /><br />Those were steps on how to make the digitle notebook, but how about using it? to use it is simple. well first, while holding your finger on the notebook, the options to erase the notebook, send the notebook to a email or change it to a Pdt file should come up. but when you open it, there will be a tab on the very top that says title, there you may put whatever title you would want. Then tap the bottom it to type whatever you want. I cant remember all the tabs at the bottom but I can tall you the ones I remember. The tab that shows a pencil is to lock changing everything in the notebook so instead you may only read your notes. The other tab I remember is the tab that shows a pen, that can be used to make charts, graphs, and things like that. It should also contain tabs in it to change the Colorado, erase it, send itto email, etc. this is what I have remembered.<br /><br />So to conclude this review, I used the word tab to describe pretty much all the buttons or whatever, GET OVER IT!!!<br /><br />Hope you enjoyed the review

B009K86D86|5.0|Watched this twice. Compelling and thought-provoking without being sensationalist. If you thought you knew about food production, think again. Everyone should see it.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|This was one of the top rated documentaries in my book. Loved the path it traveled. My fervent wish is that Rodriguez gets the recognition in this country that he deserves!
B00BETX5PS|5.0|We have really enjoyed Streaming movies from Amazon (either purchase/rent or free) from Amazon through our Tivo box. Very easy & convenient. Couldn't decide on Skyfall or the Denzel Washington movie and went for Skyfall. Good action & enjoyed the story.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I love the 20min workouts, they are challenging and make you feel like you worked out despite them being only 20-25min. Good way to start the day.
074358158X|5.0|A great read, moves the reader along, and takes the Stephen King road less traveled.  Highly recommended to any fan of King, or of a great story
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Absolutely riveting story...Excellent acting by all involved. The element of enjoying and taking life as it comes inspite of all handicaps echoed well with me
B00AC8ZA3M|3.0|I bought this movie to watch over the weekend in Europe.  Where I am there are no English language stations and my French isn't all that good, so I bought this movie to have something to pass some time with.  The sales language never said anything about the films only being available within the Continental US, i.e. I can't watch it 'til I get home.  I've already expressed this disappointment to the folks at Amazon and they've said they would make it more clear to whomever else may be wanting a movie in Europe.
B0058DRUV6|4.0|Collins makes a lot of very good observations about assembling teams and putting the right people in the right places.  My workplace adopted his strategies hook, line and sinker a few years ago.  You could see where the benefits started while the strategies were being followed, and you can also see where the train ran off the tracks when poor decisions started being made.  Good strategies, but not the end all be all of management especially regarding public service.  Finding the right people is more difficult in public service, and it is especially hard to get rid of the wrong people.  Success when following these strategies in such an environment will largely be due to either chance or a lot of really hard work in maintaining the strategy through thick and thin.
B0091REZMW|2.0|its an alright game but you have to spend money if you want to get anywhere with so and then it gets expensive
B0032UYFA6|5.0|I don'y have anything bad to say about this show. The stakes are raised every episode. No idea how they're going to end it all.
B000OT8GCQ|4.0|Nicholas Sparks is a great author. I've read so many of his books and have not been disappointed yet! Dear John was a great book!
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Bring back Matt Damon!!!!!! Sorry it's OK as a entertaining film but lacks direction. Paul Greengrass would be the right director for the next Bourne film. Let's go with a well tried formula!
B005GIS1WA|5.0|I rented this for my grandson and he loved it.  Has watched it several times and his family has gotten him the dvd for Easter
B00BP4X7TG|5.0|Unlikely story, but excellent acting and direction.  Well worth seeing this subtitled French film. A glimpse into the same social issues every country faces.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|The other diary of a wimpy kid books are more satisfying (and longer) overall, you should buy a better book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It is the best show I love it .  Hopefully there will be more of this series, I love maggie smith.
B008I3RARW|3.0|it is very hard to drive in this game because it is so tilt sensitive and when you go in reverse it doesnt work that well.
B003G4W49C|5.0|My Dad recommended this book to me. This is one of his favorite books and it proves to be just as enchanting, tragic, sci-fi packed he said it would be.
B008YU0AOE|2.0|its a normal calculator app. you can pay for different backrounds but, that costs money and there are calculator apps that do that for free
B004CEUEWE|5.0|&#34;The Town&#34; is one of my favorite films in recent memory. The ending is a little to clean, but the acting is fantastic. Ben Affleck is a so-so actor, but his direction is worth the watch.
B007A6XLDU|5.0|this app somehow has Microsoft Office on it! it has powerpoint, word, and exel! all compadible by reading it from your kindle via-pc!
B00AE2I4WK|3.0|Only reason I watch these movies is for the dancing. On that front, it doesn't disappoint. The storyline is trite, the dialogue painful, but if you ignore the &#34;story&#34; and just watch for the moves, it's a fun flick.
1582701709|5.0|iN MY HEART I KNEW THAT THE WAY YOU THINK, YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS HAD SO MUCH TO DO WITH HOW YOUR LIFE UNFOLDED, BUT I DID NOT REALIZE HOW THE LAW OF ATTRACTION WHETHER GOOD OR BAD WOULD INFLUENCE YOUR LIFE. i NOW AM LIKE  A BABY AT 56 YEARS OF AGE TO LEARN MY THOUGHT PROCESS ALL OVER.  I HAVE HAD MORE NEGATIVE THAN POSITIVE IN MY LIFE, BECAUSE MY FATHER ALWAYS TOLD ME, YOU ARE HERE ON THIS EARTH TO SUFFER, THEREFORE I SUFFERED NOT REALIZING HOW THOSE WORDS RANG TRUE.

B007TK77QE|4.0|Very readable and quite gritty and realistic in its portrait of village life in a north England town.  The characters are believable and the interaction between them is fascinating, as it covers a wide range of ages and types.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|I have used it numerous amounts of times and for  different reasons. I used it to remember something. I also used it to make notes during church service.
B00B1E6FF8|3.0|I will say it.. Not that great of a movie.. I was able to get through it but it did not impress me much.<br /><br />Katherin Bigelow has a very hard time understanding that there are more ways to create a sense of urgency and drama and stress in a movie than just having a handheld camera and shooting it gonzo style with a very unstable image..Seriously.. It is just distracting. I can understand a scene on a bus or driving down a road that a camera would be bouncing some for effect but when two people are sitting in a restaurant and the camera cannot stay still? I felt like there was a fly buzzing around the lens the entire movie as I tried to figure out why the camera was bouncing along the entire time. Anyone that saw Hurt Locker will realize this is apparently How Bigelow will shoot her movies now until the end of time.<br /><br />This movie is and should be one of the greatest stories of our time.. It should be an epic movie.. It failed miserably at that.. It is way too long at 2.5 hours. The most pivotal part of the movie, the raid, is scattered and slow and just odd. They say this story was told from actual facts from people who were involved.. What it seems like to me was that the information provided was sparse and broken. So instead of trying to fill in the 60% of the facts and details and story that was missing the director and writer tried to keep it 'real' by just not adding anything in that dead space. So the story is splotchy and just feels like it JUMPS from the start of a scene to the end without any kind of build or facts.. It is just all over the place.<br /><br />I watched this movie in it's entirety and it is not a horrible movie.. But considering Independence Day was a great movie about the world being saved from aliens. I would at least think that a movie showing one of the greatest feats in our Military's history would be able to match up. It did not.<br /><br />Katherin.. If you want to keep shooting movies like this just put them on Youtube so we can watch for free.
B008M87GJK|5.0|I am not from the US, so it is quite satisfying that I can keep up with the international news.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I got it as faotd. Pretty cool. I wouldn't pay for it. Don't know what else to say to take up the words that's need to review the game

B00846REIS|5.0|I love how quickly Amazon actually processes your order. It is not worth getting in your car and waste gas and time shopping for items your looking for. I will continue to recommend buying from amazon to all my friends.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great acting, costumes, story line, location...surprises galore......just everything is superior about this production.  Can't wait for Season 4. Hoping the same actors will return.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I have come to appreciate Amazon's service and reliability. I will continue to use Amazon every chance i get. I continue to be amazed at the efficiancy in which they process orders.

1567184855|2.0|The topic is interesting, but the interview format just did not work for me.  It is a personal preference thing--some will be enthralled and others, like myself, will find it too detailed and a bit too academic in tone
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have this game on my Kindle fire, phone and tablet.  I've been playing on one of these since Dec 2011 and haven't had any problems.  Thr Ads do exist but all you have to do is click out of it.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I could not put this book down.  The images will stay with you long after you finish reading the book.  Lots to think about.

B00A6PD9I4|1.0|*WARNING THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS* I just finished previewing BRAVE because I had heard good things and was considering buying it for my 8 year old niece and 6 year old nephew. I really wanted to love this film. I'm glad I watched it first. I would not consider buying this video for anyone under 12 and even then, I'm not sure it has much redeeming value at any age. Why? Several reasons.<br /><br />1) MOST IMPORTANTLY, THIS FILM IS VERY VIOLENT. I can forgive lame story lines etc but there are too many violent scenes. The most upsetting violence makes up most of the second half of the movie in which a bear (the mother, under a spell) is being hunted by a mob of nobles with flames, ropes, arrows etc -- and the audience knows the bear is the child's mother. The daughter is trying frantically to save her mother.  Horrifying.  Any child watching this is going to be frightened by this and fearful that the girl's mother will be killed! Also there are a lot of scenes of rowdy Scottish clans who erupt into fighting each other when they get bored. This is almost all the father does in the film, besides hunt the bear.<br /><br />2) ALSO IMPORTANT, THE HEROINE ISN'T VERY LIKEABLE OR A GOOD ROLE MODEL beyond her horsemanship, skills at archery, and of course her hair (which is beautifully animated and for most of the movie looks like a living thing -- a lovely sea anemone drifting in the current). Selfishly, she seeks a spell to transform her mother (granted, she doesn't know what the transformation will be) who is trying to get her to do something she doesn't want to do - get married (BTW, it's 2013 and women are outpacing men of the same age in education and earning power - are we still railing against marriage (even if it is arranged) as the great oppressor of women? yawn.) Why didn't she seek the spell for herself instead of her mother? When the spell goes horribly wrong, she simply does what she should do in order to save her mother's life. This doesn't seem to me to be particularly 'brave' -- just decent. She doesn't even apologize to her mother for turning her into a bear until almost the end of the movie! She spends much of the first part of the film flouncing around, running away on her horse (also beautifully animated!) and rolling her eyes at her mother and her good-natured but absent and slightly stupid father. I suspect this is to establish her 'independence' but it doesn't. She just looks like a prideful brat. That's not independence nor did she learn any.<br /><br />3) OTHER BOTHERSOME BUT NON-FATAL ISSUES INCLUDE that the plot doesn't live up to the billing and is REALLY THIN. The father is a non-existent influence, the brothers are also non-persons (both disappointing because I thought this might have something more for a little boy). This girl changed her 'fate' (maybe) by nearly destroying others (her mother and her brothers who are inadvertently caught in the spell). Was there another way to get her mother to listen to her and to avoid getting married? Probably. Even if she had run away and faced some trials (maybe killed the other bear that took off her father's leg years past) that would have been better -- SHE would have suffered and grown and when she returned home it would have been believable that she had found some independence and her own path. I don't see the growth in this plot.<br /><br />Also, the theme of a young princess who doesn't want to be in an arranged marriage is unlikely to be grasped by a younger child or to get their attention. The character is too young for this to be a believable storyline. She looks like she is @ 10 years old. An older princess character might have made this story line more believable. In short, I am very disappointed in this film and won't be buying it or recommending it, but if some hairstylist can figure out how to replicate that hair - then that would be something.
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|Typical Steinbeck style in both writing and content.  Bc it's a novella, reads quickly, more condensed than some of his longer pieces.
B000068NOV|4.0|Overall, the build quality is good. I did have problems with the two chromed strips below the doors coming off while handling the car, but those were the only two items with that problem, and it was easy to glue them back on again.
B00BF11STU|3.0|Decent film.  Was a little disappointed about the actions near the end of the film and now I understand why it's called zero DARK thirty.  Don't want to give spoilers so I'll keep it at that.
B001NLKT60|5.0|The author, Stieg Larsson, followed up his first best seller with a great book.  I could not stop reading it!
B001SGEULU|5.0|My personal Oasis list: \\"Morning Glory\\"; \\"Definitely, Maybe\\" & \\"HEATHEN CHEMISTRY\\"!  Oasis could have taken the easy path, churning out more \\"Morning Glory\\"'s & \\"Definitely, Maybe\\"'s with some chord changes & different lyrics.  But, these guys're too talented & creative for that.  And, it continues to show & shine in HEATHEN CHEMISTRY!  Oasis has proven that they are exceptional...what stops a lot of great bands is they become too closely identified with one particular decade's style of music - not Oasis; they sound like they could have come from just about any decade (except, possibly, the 80's).  They've done this, because their work has evolved, while they've remained true to their souls, which has also enabled them to maintain their original fan base, while adding new fans with each new CD/album. (Check out \\"Dig Out Your Soul\\" which continues this journey, prior to Noel's departure).<br /><br />More bandmembers do more songwriting, I believe, beginning with \\"HEATHEN CHEMISTRY\\", and do quite excellent at it.  Liam proves he can write more than ballads (Little James, Songbird) with \\"Better Man\\"...a rocker!  Gem (Archer) hidden \\"gem\\"...fantastic rocker \\"Hung In A Bad Place\\"  It's the bollocks!!  Manchester to English dictionary = it rocks!!!!!!!<br /><br />Never a big ballad fan myself, Liam changed that, especially on \\"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\\".  If there's such a thing as a \\"power\\" ballad, this is it.  His voice undergoes such a dramatic transformation on ballads, becoming so pure & clear (not adjectives normally associated with Liam Gallagher!), they're achingly beautiful.<br /><br />Definitely noteworthy: on HEATHEN CHEMISTRY, Johnny Marr (formerly of The Smiths and Electronic) guests on guitar, slide guitar & backup vocals.  Intrigued, I did research on him & he's another great talent.  Ended up purchasing Johnny Marr & The Healers \\"Boomslang\\" (haven't rated it yet) but it's great!  Zak Starkey (Ringo Starr's son) is on drums.  Zak did drums for Oasis on \\"Definitely, FOREVER\\", Live At Glastonbury in '04.<br /><br />Even though Noel quit in '09, Oasis fans; don't despair.  Both brothers formed their own projects.  Liam has all the Oasis bandmembers on Beady Eye.  Please see my review of \\"Different Gear, Still Speeding\\".  (All rock fans, check these bands out, too: Jet, Black Box Revelation & The Hives.)<br /><br />Meantime, we're awaiting the release of Beady Eye's sophmore CD this year, 2013 & maybe we will be fortunate enough for an Oasis 20 year reunion in 2014 (still can't beat the brothers when they harmonize)!  If you haven't already done so, get ahold of \\"HEATHEN CHEMISTRY\\" - you won't regret it!  Nice one!finitely, FOREVER\\", Live At Glastonbury in '04.<br /><br />Even though Noel quit in '09, Oasis fans; don't despair.  Both brothers formed their own projects.

B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Not as &#34;fresh&#34; as the opening 2 seasons, but the writing and characters are still engaging; setting and costumes beautiful.  Maggie Smith is brilliant as always, an, thought the season end annoyed my, I look forward to Season 4!
B004OZZ624|4.0|Very intense and moving story.  Keeps you interested throughout, all though I hated seeing him beatup!  I'd watch it again.
B004SKLFJS|5.0|No words to describe! It is important to check that the Blu-Ray region is the correct one for your country.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|Mathew McConaughey was super, showing his ego faults and  his quick conclusions with the evidence. Not very realistic but entertaining.
B00BF123WG|1.0|My husband and I both disliked this film. We though the movie was too dark, slow moving and difficult to follow.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I had bought one at walmart and it looked the same but was not the same it would not charge my kindle so it was worthless got this one it works great
B004H6G0TI|3.0|This game has great graphics and is tons of fun to play but on my Vzw GS3 running CM10.1 there is this weird popping noise when you select options in the game. The popping doesn't go away even when the device volume is turned all the way down. It gets a little annoying sometimes.
B004SKEHP2|5.0|I listen to this album all the time.  I hate that it took me so long to figure out what a terrific band they are!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This last book of the series was somewhat unexpected but enticing. I'm not a huge reader but really enjoyed the whole series.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|i was expecting more action<br />i m such a fan of the series i still love it.<br />hope part 2 will be better
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Joffrey Baratheon is such a little sweetheart! Definitely one of the most lovable, likeable, all-around GREAT characters in fiction. With all of the smut and violence and cheap shocks and glorified anti-heroes that you find in the modern media, its refreshing to see such a morally upstanding, unambiguously -good- character to root for. He's such a good role model for my children, and everyone I know is inspired by his compassionate heart and unwavering moral compass. 5 stars just for this character. Long Live King Joffrey Baratheon!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is awesome .one minor problem though ;it let me play it but then whenever I. clicked on it it doesn't work.tell me how to fix it.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|It's a tie with Batman: Under the Red Hood, but if you like other Batman Animated movies, you will LOVE this one. It does have quite of a bit of adult-ish content, however, and I certainly would NOT recommend it for anyone under 12.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|My 4year old loves this game and has such a fun time playing it. The controls are easy. Good free app!
B00787IR2Q|4.0|I should have complained about this movie, as it stopped and started multiple times, and not due to our internet of buffering. It was the movie itself. It even stopped for a couple minutes at 2 different times. I like the movie a lot, so I have it 4 stars, but the quality was terrible.
B0013FBS20|5.0|I personally loved this movie. While I would not say it is a classic it is a very good movie about how man begins to tinker with things they should not and the ramifications of it.
B009X01C64|2.0|Sorry to say it was a nice case except the stand is very unstable to the point<br />of being a disaster many times. Returning.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|THe only problem is when I purchased this the computer it was on died, and I have lost access to the app entirely,  THis has been discouraging, why pay for something on the cloud you can not access?
B004SIIBGU|4.0|The app functions but is structured differently than the site. Some options are buried and have to be searched for.
B003YNFYD8|4.0|Has some of the Beatles best songs without buying all the albums. Nicely showcases that period of the Beatles work.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Love the series it is absolutely fantastic so enjoying the second series very much.  Looking forward to getting the next one when it comes through.
B0063M22QO|4.0|It's just plain mahjong with different layouts.  It's fine if you want to just play mahjong!!!  It's nice to play on the kindle fire because you can use your fingers!!
B000FC0SIM|5.0|I never imagined this book would include such personal experiences by the author. If, it had resembled a textbook about writing that would have been fine, but it was filled with great practical advice about writing, personal stories, and excellent examples of the major writing topics. How can a book about writing be a page turner? It was. Thanks for the good advice and interesting stories.
0066620996|4.0|This book has some great concepts, kind of comical that several of the companies mentioned as long-lasting and good business models (Circuit City for example) have gone belly-up.  I would still recommend the book.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I think Colleen did a nice job developing the characters.  The young romance was sweet and genuine and was developed in a realistic way.  The story was intriging and kept my interest.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|this app is so fun but then I got to the point that it unlocked tricky but then it had a spas out moment on me and I literly wanted to throw the kindle out the window but I didn't so this is my second time it did that to me and I well.....just b prepared to slap ur device cuz I did.  it hasn't happens to my sister yet so it might just b my kindle but its a fun game if it spent cause u to slap it and about brake a finger
B009GENZKS|3.0|It was dark, hard to see, and I did not know it was not &#34;live&#34;. The plot was ok, though.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|temple run 2 is fun but I think temple run is better but I recamend getting this app cuz its fun and different then the first temple run....different effects:)
B009VB7P6G|5.0|Cute kids movie, but as adults, my children and I all enjoy it. It just made us happy and definitely worth sharing with younger children as well.
0670023329|5.0|Great fine loved it swell good nice twenty three more words to go now only four to go ahhhh done.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I loved this book from the moment I started reading that first page to its very last. I struck hard from each of the charactars and fall instinly in love with them. It was such a beatiful story that I am going to love reading it over and over again. =)
0385523912|5.0|Great fine loved it swell good nice twenty three more words to go now only four to go ahhhh done.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this story. I was attached to this book from the moment I started the first page to very last page. It was unbelievably one of the most romantic story's ever! I cried and laughed and smiled my way through.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|so very relaxing...just love when i am stressed out from a hard day at work or when things at home are working on my last nerve.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this series! Can't wait for season 4!  Once i started it i couldn't stop watching it!! Wish I could fast forward time:)
B000FCKGPC|5.0|This book goes into such great detail of minor characters and I felt as though there was a lot of plot movement and character development. So far this book was the most interesting of the series. Now it's time for me to explore a dance dragons
B0027MJU00|5.0|I loved it. It's gritty, engaging, and has enough detail to be interesting without monotonous. I can't wait to read the author's other books
B005UBNKWO|3.0|I bought the 6100 and a m5a78l-lm-plus , built it and wasnt very happy , yes it overclocks<br />like crazy , I had it up to 4.0 without increased voltage , but its slow still .<br />I tried everything , upgrading the bios and other tweaks to no avail , its slow on the<br />internet and loading video , I know your looking at a video card bottleneck ,but the<br />card worked great on my previous build .<br />I had ordered a 955 phenon on e-bay , used , as a backup , so I pulled the new M/B<br />out , installed my old m3a78-cm ( i had a phenon 2 x3 720 before) installed the 955 on it,<br />Bam , Im back in business , faster than I need , and my needs arent complex.<br />The 6100 overclocks like no tommrow and runs really cool , but its slow.<br />The only other things that might have held it back : Im running XP pro , Using a 760<br />chipset instead of a 900 plus motherboard .<br />Its possible the motherboard wasnt a good match , even putting the 955 on it didnt<br />speed it up , only placng the 955 on the old m3a78-cm did it come to life.<br />Turbo off as well , had to manually boost the memory in bois to get the 1600 advertised<br />by the memory specs.<br /><br />Update 05/2013<br /><br />After using unleashing mode and backing off to 3.6 , this processor seems much happier ,<br />me too its faster than its replacement .<br />At this pint in time , I probably would be happier with an eight core , or at least a 6300.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|I like the beautiful scenes, interesting Indian customs, and funny animals. The story of Pi with his tiger is unique. The reason I give it 4 stars is that at the beginning of the movie, although there were a lot of interesting animals and Indian customs, I was impatient to get the main theme of the story. The story starts actually from the family decision of selling the animals and ends when Pi lands.
B00A83075M|1.0|Not sure where all these positive reviews are coming from, but this is one boring movie.<br />Starts out reasonably well, but as soon as Sarah Silverman's character is introduced the<br />movie just gets bogged down in story-telling mire. Even John C Reilly, who I like a lot<br />as an actor, seems terribly bored with his role, and voice acting is utterly lifeless --<br />sounds like he's reading a newspaper or texting someone while he's doing Ralph's voice.<br />The animation is spectacular,as you would expect, but it really is wasted on a cliche, drab<br />and far too long story. My diagnosis: Skip-it Ralph.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|I am always impressed with the writing and acting in this show.  How they manage season after season to keep things fresh and new and never seem like...oh just another crime drama is amazing.  The new cast dynamic is great and I was leery at first of the changes to be honest.  The plot arc this season with Dr. Reed and the stalker elements was great.  I love the show and will keep watching for more seasons to come.
030716327X|3.0|The box holding the book and bunny was dented on the side. Not exactly nice for gift giving. I was a little disappointed in the size of the bunny.I thought it would be bigger. Of course, that's my fault not yours.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Star Trek-love it~! Can't wait for this summer's sequel! Woo-hoo!!The actors portraying the characters jumped right in where my favs have let them. Never thought the original could be improved on. I was wrong. Way to go, JJ Abrams!
B009KEN87O|5.0|This is a pretty cool game, I've enjoyed playing it for the last week or so. It definitely gives you a warm fuzzy feeling when thinking about the old days in the arcade.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|this is an alright game wish the horse ran smoother. other than that I find it quite entertaining. and s
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love the game.  Its so much fun to play. The horses. Are adorable and fun. I names my horse beauty and she is fun
B000BYA5GE|1.0|I hated this movie.  In fact I threw it away as a total loss.  If I could rate it less then one star I would.
B00BI73CVI|2.0|It was painful to watch, starting with Russell Crowe singing. I know it's a musical but couldn't there have been some dialogue that's not sung? I couldn't make it through the movie.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I read a lot but don't often review. I'm very particular about books but this book deserves 5 stars. I.could.not.stop.reading.<br />First of all, I loved that it was written from a child's perspective. I thought it would irritate me but it didn't- it was insightful and gave a perspective that few people think about. I also loved the character development and the fact that the mother was strong, but not perfect. I wish I loved all books as much as this one.
B00B23O96A|1.0|I was HUGELY disappointed in the CD. Not ONE song is written by Eric. The first 2 cuts are nice (only nice, not good) and the rest of the CD is garbage.<br />I'm going to either give mine away or leave it someplace.<br />P.S. I recently had the privilege of seeing Eric in concert. I couldn't help noticing that he only performed one song from this album during a 2 1/2 hour concert.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I CHOSE MY RATING BECAUSE IT'S SO AMAZING!!!!!!and I LOVE IT!!!!!I JUST WISH YOU COULD INCLUDE THE THREE<br />WITCHES!!!THAT WOULD BE AWESOME!!!
B00BHMETKC|4.0|This was a good movie and great story but not an Oscar Award Winner for best picture. Still recommend this movie.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|It was great, I love reading classics.  This book really deserved five stars.  I was in the Broadway musical of this show.  It was great.
B006LSZECO|3.0|As others have indicated, the ending is bad...really bad. I enjoyed the flow, but wished it ended sooner with realism and reader delight.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|When traveling with my granddaughters (15 & 4 yrs old) it keeps them occopied.  They are in different age bracket but both can enjoy it.
B00BI5IXL4|1.0|This movie was a big disappointment. The previews give the feel of a spectular musical. It was totally lacking including acting.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|fun game just dont like having to buy things with gems keeps my little one occupied as well. dont have to spend real money if you play your cards right
B00BF11UM0|4.0|This gave a good fictitious yet real account of the capture of osama bin laden. The depiction was close to what was reported.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's amazing I love it awesome additive fun super cool beyond awesome king polish hub uhh th lingo hubby Intel mogul
B00BF2RTO2|5.0|REALLY wish this included the 2012 Maiden England tour as well. As much as I love the 88 release, the revival tour last year had a somewhat better setlist and incredible pyrotechnics. Bruce also sounded better in 2012 than he did in 88 (of course..they toured much more back then).<br /><br />UP THE IRONS!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing. You go nonstop through Rome without stopping until a train hits you. I recommend subway surfers for everyone.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I really liked this book. It isn't the best book I've ever read, but it did make me realize that I have a great husband!
B009NXV2RK|4.0|Alamingly plausable, Clancy has done his homework well to provide us with yet another exciting read. A great book for that long haul flight.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I can't stop playing.  I think I am addicted and I may have to be deprogrammed.  When i can't fall asleep i sometimes play until 4-5 am in the morning.
B008220D7S|1.0|I've been a huge fan of Judd Apatow's films since \\"The 40 year old virgin\\", however \\"This is 40\\" fails to deliver what one would expect. It's a spinoff to Apatow's 2007 genuis comedy \\"Knocked Up\\" and follows the couple Pete and Debbie through an age and financial crisis period. Where this movie fails to deliver is it doesn't know what exactly it wants to be. Is it a comedy? (I wasn't laughing) or is it a Drama. The characters aren't interesting enough to have been given this spinoff film. The movie falls straight flat and isn'what we've come to expect from Judd Apatow. If you want to see a great Judd Apatow movie save $15 and order \\"Funny People\\".
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This amazing game with crystal clear graphics and amazing resolution. this game is so far in my opinion the BEST Modern Combat game so far. i hope Gameloft can make more games like this
B000002UZU|5.0|I'm a big fan of johnny Lee as well as Canned Heat. These to together make an out of site collection of tunes. I'd recomend this to anyone that is into John Lee Hooker, or Canned Heat.
B003QSMCKO|5.0|This movie was a great family feel good movie. No matter how many times we watch it, we still love it as much if not more than the 1st time.
B003XRELGQ|5.0|....on human folly.  I have read it many times.  It is almost beyond praise.  Drink in the sweet foma.  It is not possible to make a mistake.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much more than I expected.  I would highly recommend.  It was a good bookclub choice, too.
B007HACDLK|4.0|The Last Man was a good book.  It wasn't the best Flynn has written, but it was a page-turner and I couldn't put it down.  Unless you have some problem with Flynn's style, you'll like the book.  The story was great, the characters were decently developed and it was a good length.  I recommend this book.
B009LDD5E0|5.0|i love the season and i cant wait till season 4 comes out and i don t care what other people think to me it a good show
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|This book, along with other Mark Twain stories, should be required reading for young people.  It was great to reread one of the old classics.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This is a fun game. I'll give a game 5 stars if it keeps my attention for more than a week. Very nice graphics and music. It's challenging and it lets you go back and keep trying to improve your previous score. It's fun to race against the clock but it not so fast paced that it makes you nervous. No trouble installing on the Toshiba Thrive. I got this on the Amazon free app of the day, but it's worth paying for if you missed it.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I am enjoying this book immensely.  Although not &#34;action-packed,&#34; it does provide interesting insight into the lives of Lincoln and his contemporaries.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Everyone has a few games that you go back to over and over. This is one of them. Simple but very addictive because you always try one more time to see if you can beat your fastest time. I like the music, the graphics are great and the play is very responsive.
B009KEN87O|5.0|I'm a big fan of retro gaming. This 1 is excellent.  It has the right feel, almost like the original space invaders.
B0095P31L6|5.0|I streamed this from my Prime membership, thinking it'd be a good kids movie to watch with my one year-old. It's a bit much for her at that age, but she did watch parts of it with great interest. Me, on the other hand, I watched the WHOLE THING with great interest.<br /><br />It started out very cheesily, but got going pretty well.
B0050R0XEG|5.0|Got this for my daughter who is a big lego fan. It took a good amount of time and concentration to assemble and has great play value once it's all together.
B00514HDNW|5.0|And now I can read it anytime I want, anywhere. It was my into to Richard Matheson's work, along with The Incredible Shrinking Man.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Let's get it out of the way that this program is a soap opera. Now to what I like and don't like.<br /><br />The setting and costumes are very rich and beautiful. After the first time, watch it a second or third time to look at the background and costumes. Notice that Lady Cora's morning tea service is Herend porcelain. The production crew includes a history consultant to try to get the correct the historical context. The two minor negative I might say are the characters' behaviors and verbal idioms are not always correct for the period.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Works really well great time waster adds a nuisance but tolerable keeps mind active  easy to play kids love it
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Cute game. Very cool graphics. I like the way the game allows you to interact with your horse and the challenges can be a little tricky.
B000OXHRRC|2.0|Extremely weak compared with the book by the same title by Peter Mayle. In this movie they left out all of the most exciting and funny parts!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|My sister read Proof of Heaven [[ASIN:1451695195 Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon's Journey into the Afterlife]  by Dr. Eben Alexander and highly recommended it for me to read.  It is written by a medical doctor - a neurosurgeon -- with top shelf credentials who nearly died from meningitis and who traveled from this plane of existence into the next.  Dr. Alexander gives a very compelling, straightforward account of his illness, his experiences on the other side and his life today.  Obviously, this experience effected him greatly.  Dr. Alexander's journey was very reassuring and comforting: You can do no wrong was a feeling he kept on receiving.  Also, he realized that love is the currency of the after life.  This book is extremely compelling in it's presentation and delivery of the message.  While I don't know if  I will experience an after life exactly like Dr. Alexander's experience, I do know that there is an after life and that the only thing we can take with us is the most value commodity in existence - love.
B007SOQBCM|3.0|It is a good app if it worked half the time.  There are some times when I try to watch a video but nothing plays.<br /><br />Also dont like that you can't find all channels, only the top channels.
B00007GZR5|5.0|Maybe my opinion is skewed because of my deep love for this underrated movie.  I don't know.  All I can say is I'm a pretty big, 6'4&#34; male that cries like a baby every time I watch this movie.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I really really enjoy this app! I had all the previous Shark apps and liked them so I went ahead and got this one too.<br />The Shark is soooo much more realistic on this one. The point system is real cool too. I think anyone over 4 would enjoy it.
B0042816YK|2.0|Pretentious, boring, and way too predictable.  Julia Roberts, being the incredible actress that she is, could really start choosing her roles a bit better. Would not recommend.
B007N6NGYG|4.0|I enjoyed the fact that it starts out rather easily and then builds up to more engines to be aware of and also having to be aware of where they have to gol  Thank you.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|I am a huge bond fan, especially the Sean Connery days.  To say that a movie beats Goldeneye or Octopussy, etc. is a far stretch in this franchise, but thats exactly what im saying. It was clever, fast paced action like you expect from a Bond movie, Heineken or no.  A must watch for 2013.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I like it and dis like it.I don't like it because:no animals no mobs no dark no survival you cant sleep because there's no dark time and you cant set off Tnt.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|Best version of Mahjong I have found on here. I have tried many versions and so far this one has caught all my interest.
B001BC2ZS6|4.0|This was an entertaining book, with a lot of twists that I never expected. 9/10, would recommend to anyone. LOLWORD
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I had to delete the game....it glitches and freezes on me. Maybe if it didn't do that; maybe just maybe...i would have kept it!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I like that I can save a song as an mp3 to my phone.  Sometimes you don't need a video, just the audio and this app is handy in that situation.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I started watching this on Netflix and now i'm a hardcore walker...lol. I cannot miss an episode...i just have to see Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus). It's good...real, real good!! :)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|and always read the bible.<br />that's why this app is so good<br />you have the Bible where ever you go<br />and share it to others.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I replaced my n52 which I really liked but I needed more buttons. I was a little worried that the feel would not be right. I have to say that it took a little time to get used to this coming from the n52, But I am really happy with this purchase, I actually have too many buttons.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I read A LOT of books...I kept hearing from everyone to read this one....people that know I love to read, people in the grocery store discussing it, sisters, colleagues, friends....  I do not and cannot fathom what the big deal was.  I skipped chapters in the book!  I struggled to finish it -- and that is only because I kept wanting to find something that made the $10 purchase worthwhile!  It was repetitive, twisted, awful -- downright pathetic!  I guess this type of dark, bizarre 'romance' is not for me.
B0041D843M|5.0|This book has already, definitely, changed my life. His argument for a more plant based diet becomes more compelling as his evidence unfolds - and there is so much of it. And it makes such good sense: it kept me nodding in recognition and then often being surprised by those 'Ah-ha!' moments where Campbell has revealed the bio-chemical reality behind some simple but significant changes we can make in our diet. I have been telling all my friends and family to read this book.
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|I downloaded this game and loved it.... until it was erased... 2 TIMES!!! I went from having almost everything to NOTHING! Both times it got erased occurred right before I had enough money to purchase the Great White Shark. I told my children I wasn't paying REAL money to get back to where we were (well over $50). I will never get another game from this company EVER again.
B000AP04OM|5.0|I grew up watching Sound of Music, so I was happy to be able to share this wonderful classic with my two boys!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Was a little different from the movie, but that made it even better. I love Nicholas Sparks' books and this one is no exception.
B0094K1MH2|5.0|So maybe I'm a child at heart.  Sometimes you really get tired of blood 'n guts etc etc etc.  Sometimes a good ol' cute good guy mean bad guy lots of action adventure is just the thing.  So this is for those times.  I wouldn't mind watching this again.
B007OCD1OO|5.0|Anything Simply Red does is amazing!! Loved this, it is nice to see him in the earlier days, he still has the voice, much richer now.  So buy this and add it to your library, it's worth it.  Sadly, I will not get to see the perform live so this is truly the next best thin.  It's not as good as the Albert Hall concert, but a good one none the less.
B00A23MYCC|4.0|Wasn't what I was expecting, but in a good way. Let me just say if anybody has a problem with alcohol or other drugs, then this isn't the movie for them. I appreciated the movie for what it was, essentially just another family guy type of film.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so fun i love it<br />I like this game because i love horses or say it like this i&lt;3horses
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Started slow and got  better after each page! Can't wait to read the next book and find out what happens next!
B00BESJYAY|4.0|Good for all ages. Would love to have seen more relationships between the main characters and their family members.<br />Made me investigate more of the story online.
B0042MDAL8|5.0|Good story line that the spouse likes. Looking forward to further episodes in the series. Wish there was more action.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|GREAT PRODUCT,EASY TO USE.I WAS LOOKING FOR A PRODUCT FOR MY KINDLE FIRE TO DOWNLOAD YOUTUBE VIDEOS.THIS WAS PERFECT.I WAS ABLE TO DOWNLOAD AND WATCH ALL OF MY VIDEO MUSIC CLIPS FROM THE TEMPTATIONS MOVIE ON MY KINDLE FIRE.
030758836X|1.0|Forced myself to finish the book.  Was really disappointed with the ending and much much of the f word.  Don't waste your time reading this one.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Not Up To 007 Standards.  Just started warming to warm to Craig as 007, and then the plot deserts him.
B002A9VJ40|5.0|Top Gun is the quintessential 80s film, it has everything from action to romance to a homoeroticism volleyball scene! Not to be missed.
0525953728|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Saw &#34;Zero Dark Thirty&#34; about 3/4 of the way through reading it and it made it even more enjoyable.
B0079XNWQA|5.0|Very good lots of guitar sounds Jason Mraz delivers good vocals. Lyrics are great the music carries you away as you listen it's a holiday packed in to every song.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I liked it because it wasn't preachy about how one should live. It was Cheryl's story will victories, screw ups and process of life. We all should experience a journey such as this to truly evaluate what and why of life.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|Amazing! I really enjoyed this book! The characters are like able and the story is so unique. With so many crime/court shows on TV showing how the court system works from the prosecution's point of view, it was refreshing to be on the defense side.
B000MCIBB6|5.0|Some really great tracks on this album.<br />The album artwork is great and the outtakes give the<br />listener a more intimate listening experience.<br />Definitely recommended.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I've spent many wonderful evenings solving crime with the Lieutenant since receiving this set of dvds! How wonderful to have the whole collection in one set! Highly recommend to any Columbophile!
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Great little game for those who like mindless entertainment. More fun if you have friends who play it also so you can compete for high scores and weekly ribbons.<br /><br />Only one &quot;level&quot;, so if you like variety this isn't for you. You play the same short timed game over and over trying to do it better. Great for mindless entertainment.<br /><br />I have had no issues downloading or syncing with Facebook, unlike previous reviewers.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I looooooove this game so much!!!! It is so super fun and i could play it all day long. Every time i get a new high score, i practically start screaming and jumping up and down to celebrate!!!
B002BW7A58|1.0|Heard one track from this album (Drop the World) and decided to buy. This one song is pretty good. The lyrics are raw. The music has a great undertone.  However the remainder of the album was pathetic and weak. The rymes were a complete joke and the use of effects on the vocals were completely over done. Was not a Lil Wayne fan before hearing this album and certainly am not now.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|received on time ,and was exactly what we expected.. no problems at all with any part of the order .
030745455X|5.0|what else can be said of this fantastic writer.  i am so sorry he passed away as i would have bought every one of his books.
B009MO57H6|5.0|received on time ,and was exactly what we expected.. no problems at all with any part of the order .
0307454541|5.0|i love all of his books about this girl, but this one i love the very best.  will there ever be a writer who can hold me as transfixed as stieg larsson has?  i am transfixed from the first to the very last page!
B004U8VWLE|5.0|This is a great movie, don't watch any of the gross parts with the hands and feet mutilation. Watch the lesbian sex scene twice. Also watch the final black swan performance twice, you'll be a better person for it.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|It took my daughter nagging me to watch Mad Men.  Since she had the first 4 seasons on DVD I took them all and when I finished watching I was hooked.<br />The writing is smart and gives a look at the 1960's in NYC at a advertising firm.
1451696191|3.0|I love crime dramas but do have a secrete weakness for young adult books. This one however with all the hype I was not totally impressed. it was a quick read. As it has not been a month since I read it I can not really tell you anything about it. Whether it was the lack of impact or the fact that I have read 7 books since. take it as you wish
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I enjoy playing this game when I have some time to.  My grandchildren also like playing when the come to visit.Thanks for offering it
0307341550|5.0|I really wanted to read gone girl but seeing as she has two previous books I decided I better read those first and needless to say I was not disappointed and very impressed so I cant wait to read Gone Girl. The first two were so good and I didn't really hear about them so I can only imagine how the third will turn out!
B005CRY2O6|3.0|I keep flipping through this looking for something that I'm dying to make, but after a few weeks nothing has called my name. That's probably because after reviewing each recipe I've had the everything but issue...and usually I have no clue where to find it.<br /><br />On the Kindle version the setup is kind of crappy. It looks like a word document with images plopped in the middle. I'm really not a fan and it doesn't help to make the recipes enticing.
0316223239|5.0|Oh I don't know where to start. At first when I started reading I had to reread things. But just keep in mind it is written in a five year olds perspective so when random thoughts come in you didn't miss anything and just to keep going. I am a firm believer that I wish I lived back when times were simpler and this book only reminded me of that. I believe all teenagers should read this book. Whether it be for the girls and a warning or for them to appreciate everything in their lives.
0060589280|5.0|I love this book so much that I've literally given it to all of my friends.<br /><br />Sure, at first glance, it's a book about sex, but once you dig a bit deeper you'll find a book about the complexities of love. From love of self to romantic love.<br /><br />Coelho bravely attempts to tackle questions such as: what is love? how do I love? how do I receive love? how do I not confuse sex with love? how do I use sex to show love? Each answer left me pondering my own ability to love.<br /><br />I found this book moving and filled with moments that required a highlighter and some prayer. At it's conclusion, I found that it really changed my young views on love for the better.<br /><br />I dare you to give it a try.
0307341577|5.0|I really wanted to read gone girl but seeing as she has two previous books I decided I better read those first and needless to say I was not disappointed and very impressed so I cant wait to read Gone Girl. The first two were so good and I didn't really hear about them so I can only imagine how the third will turn out!
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|I didn't love this. Sure Denzel's performance was flawless, but the plot moved slowly.<br /><br />At the end of the day, this really wasn't what I expected and maybe that was the problem.
1419705849|4.0|For a kids book it was pretty good and probably would keep one entertained. but as for me there really didn't seem to be a start and an end. but It was highly funny.
B00913P6G0|5.0|Oooooh yeah! This album is full of good beats, & awesome lyrics......  Kendrick Lamar is now one of my favorite rapper just because of this album. I would recommend this album....
0439796644|5.0|This book was a fast read but on the other hand it had more emotion then most book I have read. You will find yourself smiling and most of all you will find tears in your eyes and not just for sad moments. I believe everyone should read this at one point in their life! Very uplifting!
B001QXCYZY|1.0|As others have noted, this mic does not do a good job of picking up sound. If you do buy one, test it immediately to see if it works and return it immediately if it doesn't. Also make sure you register for the extended warranty, you will probably need it. Judging from the reviews, only some of the mics work. Kind of like a lottery. I got stung. I hope I can save you some frustration and grief.
B0047GNCSU|5.0|I loved this quick read! Usually I only go towards the Crime Dramas but I thought I would give it a try! I will however WARN anyone who reads this to make sure you have book 2 ready to go as this book just ends in the middle of the story!!! I was scrambling to order book 2!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I grew up on metaphysical philosophies and a belief in a Universe that hears you (and sometimes answers you), but this book helped me to solidify those beliefs.  The experiments work/worked.  For instance, I hadn't seen butterflies in months, but when it was my turn to do that experiment, my friend sent me an email (out of the blue) and it was peppered with butterflies.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed hearing the stories of Napoleon Hill, Michael Bernard Beckwith, and Gerarld Jampolsky.<br /><br />The book is written in a fluid style.  I often felt as if I was reading letters from a dear friend.  It offered information in a fresh way, instructing without preaching.  LOVE THIS BOOK!!!!
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|Great Movie! This is a funny movie for the whole family to watch. It brought back some memories from when I was a kid when we played all of the old school video games.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|This is my favorite Tv series. Nathan Fillion and the whole cast are great! The combination of comedy drama & romance is perfect. So fun to watch week to week. Even more fun to watch all over again on DVD.
0143116053|3.0|The first third of this book is funny, especially if you are hard-of-hearing.  Then the author gets side-tracked by other life problems. If you order the book to laugh about hard-of-hearing problems, you will be rewarded briefly.  I guess it's worth it just for that.  But be forewarned.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|This is a perfect combination of comedy drama & romance. The storyline is very intreging week to week.. I love the whole series !!
B001CDZZI6|2.0|The primary reason that I purchased this here was to get the online code that was &#34;included&#34;.<br />If you are really interested in this, head down to your local bookseller and buy a hard-copy.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is awesome. I got this free but if it was not free I would still get this!! This is 5 stars for me!!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Would be a 5 star app but after playing like 5times it wouldn't start. So I can't use I don't recomend it to kindle users but for other devices this app is Awesome.
B0064X79JC|5.0|I love this book and I love the movie based on it!  A good read, a must read!!  If you love cars, and noir, you will love this story!
B00338QENI|5.0|Excellent price, quality, & service. Order was delivered quickly. I would order again from Amazon and recommend your service to everyone.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Enjoyed this. Would suggest this to all my friends. Am amazed how this truly relates to our world right now.
B00BRR66SA|4.0|Justin hit out the park with this album.  His production on this album is next level.  You can put in the album and just let it play...  Great album for any occasion.
B00BI745AA|5.0|It is a crime that this movie did not win the Best Picture oscar.  I saw Argo and it was very good, but this version of Les Mis is in a whole different class of greatness.  The acting, cinematography, music, story - all outstanding!  The whole theater broke out in applause at the end, when does that happen?
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This a very readable, have you on the edge of your seat, love story.<br />Although I wouldn't rank Nicholas Sparks as being the best writer around, he certainly can tell a story!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very common and good . Learning for kids that want to own one some day<br />Love this app and I am sure other children will to
B000K4WPCM|5.0|This is one of those movies that while many may not like others like myself will always enjoy! I wouldn't call it the best nor the worst you decide? I like the intensity that it brings overall. Many may call it a movie about a bunch of good looking guys and girls with no talent, while others would call it a cool little flick with a bunch of kick-ass witches, you decide!!!!!!
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|love it on the weekend I play it every single minute good game good for sleep overs love it if you have a child get it ages 5-100 also good for long trips for spring break also you can dowland a setting cooler than temple run.
B003SHYVO8|5.0|Can't call dance movies Oscar wining performances, but the dance moves in these movies will definitely wow you!!!! This movie was a great treat just like the 1st one!! Anyone who likes movies about street dance etc, will definitely love this one!
B004QX07G4|5.0|A wonderful pick me up for anyone that loves Ellen as we do. Any where, any time of the day, this book will for sure make you laugh out loud!
B003SHUMRI|5.0|Let me just start by saying channing tatum can dance his butt off wow!! Anyone who likes him as an actor will enjoy him getting his groove on! This one is definitely worth watching if you're into street style dancing, kind of brings me back to the old b-boy era where going to the clubs and and getting together with old friends was worth it!
B001NEK2GE|4.0|The G13 works pretty well, I have it configured for my Starcraft 2, Battlefield 3, Diablo 3, and my World of Warcraft.  The only drawbacks is that the software profiles by Logitech, don't always do what they say they do.  I have had to fix a few errors on the mappings and some arent fixable, I've had to create a whole map from scratch.  So if your serious about your gaming, set this up yourself, dont do pre-mapped, its just a headache.  The lighting on this pad is amazing!  If it wasnt for the mis mappings on the keys, this would earn all 5 stars.  Aside from that, I love it, its perfect for my gaming needs.

B00A4EDAN6|5.0|When this album dropped, I obviously knew it would have a mesh of fans that were more loyal to the previous sounds Tegan & Sara had and not this new electronica sound. I love the album though. It took me a day to get used to, and this new sound is great for them! All the songs are well written with interesting parts instrumentally. Great production and vocals! All in all, I give it an 9/10

B002GJT4XM|5.0|Since my original version of this movie was on it's last legs I decided to upgrade to the Ultimate Edition, and I'm glad I did. I now have a brand new copy of the original movie, and the extended version has a lot more new footage than I expected, it didn't change the movie, but if you haven;'t read the books it brings a few more things to light.<br />  I'm very happy with my purchase, and I'm glad I waited and didn't buy at the original price of $40.00 + for this set. It's nice but it's not worth that much.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Probably the best ever book for anyone interested in getting his/her health back.

They split that original edition into 2 parts.  The final book of this series (which should now be called part III) has not been written yet.  I bought the book on the assumption it was the conclusion of the Way of kings, but it is not.

B00BI5IXL4|5.0|This is a fantastic piece, and I say that as an avid fan of the show, as well as a former performer in the show, on stage. Vocals were unique and well adapted to the screen. It's a new kind of musical movie. The era of Rogers and Hammerstein's Sound of Music, with Julie Andrews, and Bernstein's West Side Story were beautiful. But it's a good day for something new.
B008YKRRIQ|5.0|The five star rating here doesn't mean that the performances of Romantic music in this box are the only ones you need of the works in question -- heavens forfend!  But if you're a serious collector, and if you like playing and comparing different approaches to substantive pieces of music, then look at the price of this, and don't hesitate -- 10 discs at under $5.00 a disc!  The performances are very strong -- Klemperer obviously knew what kind of sound he wanted (quite solid, with winds well in the picture) and Walter Legge and company knew how to put that on record.  The only Klemperer disc I've heard recently that disappointed me as sound was my 1990 pressing of the Bruckner Sixth -- not in this box.  Everything that I've sampled in this box so far has been fine, and I've enjoyed the performances even where I've been aware that there are other approaches, and that's because Klemperer's own approach is so well-realized -- strong rhythms, moderate tempi, great wind sound, with the textures of the different winds (wood and brass) clearly distinct, and a grounding in the lower strings and brass that seems to put what you hear on a rock-solid foundation.  \\"Graceful\\" isn't the first word you would use about it -- and yet the phrasing often IS graceful, even as it is robust.  The Mendelssohn Fourth Symphony is weighty here -- but it's rich and full of rhythmic life.  The Midsummer Night's Dream music is marvelously done (with the young Heather Harper and Janet Baker too!).  In the insert booklet there's a story about how Klemperer tried to persuade Walter Legge to omit or alter the coda of the Scottish Symphony, Mendelssohn's Third.  Legge would have none of it.  I was interested, then, to see what Klemperer did with it -- and it just about makes your hair stand on end.  It's as if he said, \\"You want 'Allegro maestoso assai,' I'll give it you\\" -- so he slows notably into the coda, lower strings at full bore, and by the time the trumpets come in, it's just tremendous -- not as airy as the great Maag recording, but very impressive in it's own right.  The box also contains a very fine Schubert \\"Great\\" C-major, a surprisingly good Symphonie Fantastique, powerful Tchaikovsky (especially the Fifth), and a fine Franck.  I haven't sampled the Schumann yet -- the box has all four symphonies.  In sum, a marvelous bargain.  I guess I'll just have to get the Beethoven box!ot as airy as the great Maag recording, but very impressive in it's own right.

B00B5HQLMI|3.0|Just when I'm finally getting used to Daniel Craig in the role of James Bond - and Skyfall is indeed his best performance in the role - the Bond franchise owners seem to be building a case that he is getting for the role.  But in Skyfall they are simultaneously building two other age-related discrimination cases:  the case that secret agent 007 James Bond himself may be too old to do his job effectively; and the case that the Bond franchise itself is a dated relic of the Cold War past.  There certainly is a case to be made in each of these areas, but the question is why would the Bond filmmakers make it and thereby undermine their own money-printing machine?  By doing so they deserve kudos for facing up to reality (and they avoid mockery), but one wonders where the Bond franchise will go after Skyfall, even though it doesn't appear to be the end of the road for James Bond.<br /><br />The primary reason I don't rank Skyfall among the all-time best Bond films is that it falls short in the formulaic aspects.  Bond films always contain death defying action sequences with multi-vehicle chases, a demented evil villain, beautiful women (the Bond girls), and gizmos.  All these are present in Skyfall, but none of them is quite as memorable as the best of Bond from the past.  Several times, as when Bond resurrects one of his blasts from the past, it seems that director Sam Mendes is gratuitously following the formula with a wink and a nod to the audience.  The action sequence finale of Skyfall also does not measure up to the best of Bond purely due to the plot, which left James Bond defending himself and a couple of very old folks from the onslaught of a madman's private army.  Bond comports himself admirably, of course, but the old folks can't and don't add much to the action at the end.  The net effect is that, at the end of the film, the Bond formula appears old and tired, and this viewer was left wondering how it is going to be revitalized in the future.  Is it time already to retire Daniel Craig, magically rewind the clock on the age of James Bond, and start anew?<br /><br />Even if that is the plan, the Bond franchise faces challenges, the chief one being creating villains that worldwide audiences root against.  Skyfall makes the argument that the villains of the future are not countries but individuals, which may indeed be true, but Skyfall also plays it safe by not having its evil villain come from an \\"Axis of Evil\\" region of the world.  This might work for one movie, but where will the next Bond villain come from?  Another challenge is the waning influence of the British empire and hence its secret service, which is even directly addressed in Skyfall.  The world, and the U.K.'s position in it, look a lot different now than at the end of World War II.  Where will this lead the Bond franchise in the future?  It may be worth watching the next Bond film just to find out, but it certainly appears that they heyday of James Bond is past.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I received this cable from Amazon with my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\" (purchased mid-December 2012). It is 5 ft. long and works well for charging. However, I need a longer length to comfortably use Kindle while the batteries are charging. I tried a 10 ft cable from StarTech [[ASIN:B0017JY5F4 StarTech 10-Feet Micro USB Cable - A to Micro B (UUSBHAUB10)]] which fit the ports but didn't charge or power the Kindle. I hope Amazon will make this cable available in a longer length, like 8 ft. If anyone knows of an extra long cable that charges the Kindle Fire HD, please leave a comment!
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Hollywood definitely likes Argo more than I do.  Don't get me wrong - I think it is a fine film with some impressive aspects, chief among them the recreation of the takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, Iran and the street scenes within Tehran, which is a city that few Americans ever see.  But I wouldn't rank it among the best films of the year, and I doubt that it will achieve the title of \\"classic\\".  Years from now, the film Argo will likely pale in comparison to other more substantial films, just as the events portrayed in Argo are but a footnote to the overall Iranian hostage crisis.<br /><br />There is a simple, plausible explanation for why Hollywood is so enamored with Argo: the Hollywood filmmaking industry plays a crucial role in the storyline, and it is a role in which Hollywood literally gets a chance to save the day (and lives) and have a direct influence on political events.  In other words, Hollywood (for once) gets a chance to do some unalloyed real-world good.  But the CIA and other spy organizations create many cover stories for their agents, and the one portrayed in Argo happens to be the best alternative for the circumstances, so I felt it to be fairly logical, all things considered.<br /><br />Like all movies that are \\"based on a true story\\", the filmmakers have a certain degree of freedom to enhance events to increase the drama, and my impression is that director Ben Affleck took advantage of that.  There are several scenes at the climax of the movie that are a bit hard to believe, two of which involve the incredibly fortunate simultaneous timing of events on opposite sides of the world, and a final chase sequence on an airport runway that is quite ludicrous.  If these events actually happened exactly as portrayed then I retract all these comments, but I think the odds are in my favor.<br /><br />Argo is worth a viewing if you are at all interested in the subject matter, and in particular if you can remember the Iranian hostage crisis, but don't expect it to make your list of all-time classics.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|This series is one of the best produced, skillfully directed and expertly cast and acted shows we have ever watched. It's addicting, you cannot wait for the next episode. We force ourselves to limit our watching to one episode a week because we don't want to run out of shows. Actually I think we could spend a whole day watching all of the episodes available, but then it would be over. We highly recommend Downton Abbey to anyone who likes great stories, quality acting and impeccable directing.

Delta Machine marks a landmark album in the later years of their career.<br /><br />David Gahan's voice has aged like fine wine in this album, growing deeper and darker as well as hitting the higher notes on \\"Should be higher\\" which is one of the best songs.<br /><br />Enjoyed this album, definitely my favorite behind Violator and Black Celebration.

B00BF2RTO2|4.0|Maybe I'm old school, but I miss the Maiden classic line-up. This show is the Mighty Maiden during the tail-end of their extended musical peak. As many of you all know, a few short years later, we'd lose Adrian, then Bruce, and by the time these guys returned, Iron Maiden were a band of 6. Still rocking and going strong, they're simply not the same as they were.<br /><br />But the best reason to buy this DVD release, is the concert editing of years past. How I miss the days when camera angles were limited and shots lingered enough for my eyes to actually focus on the image. Steve Harris, notorious for hyperkinetic editing, apparently took the reigns on this one, but it may have been one of his first projects and he certainly didn't go nuts (like he has in videos of late). For example, its refreshing to actually see Dave and Adrian strut their stuff during their solos instead of seeing an unnecessary split-screen close-up of Nicko's bare feet during that time. Watch this video in comparison to En Vivo, and you'll understand, what I'm referring to. It's such a pleasant change. Yeah, it's in lack-luster \\"standard def\\", and presented in 4:3 aspect ratio, which to me is the worst part, but I'll take these shortcoming over the ADD editing anyday!<br /><br />As for sound quality, the concert audio itself is a little disappointing, particularly the 5.1 surrounds of both the Dolby Digital and the DTS. I honestly expected better. Not knowing what they had to work with as a source, all I can tell you is that it certainly doesn't impress like modern day recordings. No speaker work-out here. If anything, I actually found the PCM stereo mode to be the most enjoyable and a step-up from my VHS version.<br /><br />Lastly as for the extras, I always enjoy the \\"History of Maiden\\" installments, as they give us a nice if not nostaglic look at the days long past and a peek into what the band was feeling and thinking back then. I don't think this one was done as well as Part 2, (This one has an over-abundance of slide-show style pictures of the era) but it was still fun to watch. Oh, and you get a nifty folded poster too, great for your bedroom wall if your like...uh..twelve!!<br /><br />Overall, a fantastic effort. Not quite full stars due to the lackluster audio, but still worth every penny. Cheers!<br /><br />UPDATE: I've since been able to significantly improve the DOLBY DIGITAL audio quality by changing the settings on my PS3 to output in \\"bitstream\\" rather than PCM, thereby allowing my receiver to do the decoding. Big improvement. But DTS and Stereo options were not affected by this change. (Since I watch Blu-ray 99% of the time, I have my PS3 outputting in PCM since it's the only way to obtain lossless HD audio. Bitstream output from PS3 will give you truncated data from an HD source such as blu-ray's DTS-Master Audio. However, you'll get the full bandwith of anything (DD or DTS) encoded onto just standard DVD). Understanding that everyone's equipment differs, your experience may vary!has an over-abundance of slide-show style pictures of the era) but it was still fun to watch.

B0094BB4TW|1.0|Facebook has some of the world's best programmers out there but you would never know by using this app. The default FB app that comes preloaded on the KF is better than this and operates smoothly.

That is what earns the one star for this review and that is the only time I will ever use this app if I don't delete it first.

B00B69UQEO|4.0|I'd been streaming Delta Machine on iTunes for the last couple of days, so I already knew I liked it.  For me, the Mode albums from '97 forward seem to alternate between \\"just good\\" and \\"great.\\"  True to that pattern, Delta is truly a \\"great\\" record.  If I'd change anything I'd ask for more blues and for more solid synth beats to move to.  4 stars, and I think this record belongs on the upper end of the canon.<br /><br />Amazon: you get zero stars.  If you can't (won't) deliver an album on its release date than you ought to offer auto rip.  I live in CA, there's an Amazon facility in my city, but my order shipped from back east and MIGHT arrive tomorrow.  WTF?  Seriously, now we have tax AND shipping to shop on Amazon, but I could have driven down to Best Buy and snagged a copy of Delta an hour ago for less money.  Amazon, if you want to remain competitive then you need to step it up.

B00ADS90EQ|1.0|I love this movie and decided to stream it, buying it through Amazon.  My TV had to be on level 60 for volume in order to hear it.  I'd rather return it and buy it on a physical Blu-Ray.  We checked all TV settings...it's the streaming that is faulty
B0044DEAUA|5.0|My wife purchased this blue tooth option since she does not like any of the ear bud blue tooth devices out there. It was a little pricey but works great is safe and no worries of getting pulled over for being on the phone!
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|Movie was great for adults and kids. Wasn't too long or too short. I might even buy it at a later time.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|A little long but good enough to read to the end. Anyone who likes Stephen King will enjoy this book.
B008C20TDG|5.0|I wanted to started the paleo journey and a friend recommended this book. I am SO glad that I read it. It explains the science behind paleo and gets you really excited to start. I made myself read the whole thing before jumping in, and I'm glad I did. They explain it won't be easy but it's definitely doable. They talk about meal planning and give you good starter recipes. I can't wait to try out the barbecue sauce recipe that's in here. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to try going paleo!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I tried to buy this same video (for more money) through iTunes.  Their download would not work on my computer for some reason (they have agreed to refund my purchase).  I downloaded from Amazon - it was easier and less expensive and great quality.  I will be using Amazon in the future.  I live in Mexico and frequently by videos.
0679805273|5.0|It's Dr. Seuss.....what's not to love? We keep giving this book away over and over as graduation presents. Yes, we will buy more!
1878424939|5.0|so Simple..you cant ask for it to be any simpler! Choose these 4 tips, and diligently work them, for 21 days, and you've created a new perspective, hence a new life!
B0071FBARY|5.0|An Amazing group of songs, heard a couple songs I liked so I decided to lesson to a few more! All are worthy so I ended up buying the whole MP3 album!
B007FLHW3K|3.0|I would give this device 5 stars, but for one pretty major issue:  The low battery indication (red flashing lights) comes on WAY too early.  For example, my lights have been showing blinking red only for probably the past 30-40 hours of riding.  No matter what pattern I choose or power level, they start to blink red.  Unfortunate.  It would be nice if the low battery indicators just blinked red a few times when powering on, and then let us get back to our light patterns.  I've actually had these in use now for 4+ months now and changed the batteries once, and it's happened twice.<br /><br />Still, red blinking lights are better than nothing.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|I DONT UNDERSTAND THE 5 STAR REVIEWS ... CANT DO A THING NO PICTURES NO GAMES SOMETIME NO STATUS OR EVEN REPLY TO PEOPLES POST. NO EVEN WORTH THE SO CALLED FREE. I AM DISSAPPOINTED.... SO WHY ARE PEOPLE GIVING IT 5 STARS.  EXPLAIN. AM I MISSING SOMETHING
B008XG1X18|5.0|I had no idea what i was missing before this.  when i did finally discover it, it became a quick addiction that isnt going anywhere soon.  I love it!!!
B005OT2YVA|3.0|Not a big Transformers fan. Maybe being in my late 60s, I'm too old.<br />Never got to read Transformer comics.<br />But, the CGI Bots in this movie were great. The battle sequences, outta sight!<br />As always, the best part is the hero's GF.. :)
B00009Y3L4|5.0|They don't make movies like this anymore. Liza Minnelli is fabulous. Seems like she inherited many talents from her famous mother.
140131046X|5.0|I did not read this book. I heard it on books on tape in the CD form. For an agnostic like me, I found it to be very interesting and thought provoking. The 4 CDs I heard in the car to and from work. The book is read by the author.
B005BQTUVI|5.0|If you like science fiction and suspense then the movie Mimic is for you. It combines science with fiction at its best.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Diggen a hole just one more time until I score this strike rich on diamond , iron , gold and make our digged out fortress
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|I am not a huge animation fan but this movie was GREAT!!!!  Great plot, great movie all around i would recommend to any one even if you don't have kids!!!
B003DT19F0|1.0|The dvd arrived quickly, but does not work. We tried cleaning, and different dvd players, but still will not play.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|As a restaurant veteran myself, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I think you will too, whether or not you have worked there yourself or not.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|The whole family enjoys this movie over and over! So glad we have added it to our collection this year.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I think this is a great game, but today when I was trying to rename my dragon,the keyboard was acting up. They need to fix that.
B00A7OJ0DC|4.0|3 year old enjoys this, but it does not seem like a Disney movie to me. Name calling and &#34;I hate you&#34;? Those aren't typical Disney things... all in all, entertaining and unique. Happy to add it to the playlist.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Great book for the zombie lovers - no love interests in this book - strickly interviews.  Very well written book.<br /><br />Great book.
B008220C38|2.0|The scriptwriter and director got in the way of this film--oh, weren't they clever staging a film on a stage and putting the stage in a film?  Confused? Well, so was I.  Thank you, but please save your cleverness: we came to see Anna Karenina and what we saw was obscured and corrupted.  The very best fiilms are those where the director goes unnoticed, the music in unheard, and the end credits come too quickly.
B00B69UQEO|2.0|I am no doubt in my head, I'm the biggest DM fan ever! This latest release has a couple moments of classic DM. I just could'nt get past the the overall production, which could be made with a Casio electronic piano, beat macine included, and even classic video games like Pac Man or Mario Bros. This is the 1rst time in the last 30 years of listening to DM that I thought could be improved with production. # 1 fan. Peace.
B00BESM14U|5.0|loved this movie..lost in the characters before I knew it....shoved in the story... Very believable, and witty coming of age type movie..
0307719774|4.0|I like the idea of having a journal, but don't have the time and energy to keep up with a traditional journal.  This book has a question to answer each day of the year, with spaces for five consecutive years for each question. Since I probably won't answer a question each day I'm betting this book will last me longer than 5 years! The book is hardbound with what seems to be high quality binding and gold on the edges of the paper.  It is smaller than I thought it would be, but it is the perfect size for throwing in a suitcase for a trip and still allows for plenty of space to answer the questions.  The only reason I am rating this as 4 stars instead of 5 is that my favorite gel pens tend to smear on the pages. But as long as I remember to let it dry before closing the book it shouldn't be a big problem.
B00AYB0SX4|1.0|Story not the worst , but not the best.. kinda obvious in places .cinematography terrible...glad this wasn't the theater i watched it in..
B0056BMK6K|4.0|This was a pretty good read. It is very informitive and I hope I can follow his instructions. Thanks alot.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Liked the way the character's thoughts added to the suspense of the story. I admit I saw the movie before I read the book, but I completely enjoyed it and couldn't put it down. Can't wait to read the next book.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|How is it possible for a book published in 1953, dealing with giant saucer aliens looming over major cities a la Independence Day, seem even more prescient now in the 21st Century?  Almost as astonishing, the renowned writer, Arthur C. Clarke, who foresaw in precise technical detail the coming age of satellites and space probes, was careful to insert before the Prologue of Childhood's End this cryptic sentence: &#34;The opinions expressed in this book are not those of the author.&#34;<br />Here, and throughout the book, is teasingly more than meets the eye!  A full half century before late-night talk-guests like L A. Marzulli or Thomas Horn began to suggest that the UFO-nauts - for all their vaunted, &#34;We're just here as midwives to ease your transition into your golden age&#34; - might be of a nature or agenda less benevolent.  At nearly the midpoint of the tale, when the alien &#34;Overlords&#34; finally revel themselves, their image turns out to be, indeed angelic, but unexpectedly sinister. The transcendence out of planetary childhood they promise then turns out to be nothing any mortal might have anticipated.<br />Having gone through multiple printings in many languages, this is a classic no thoughtful person should ignore.
1616550414|5.0|If you love Zelda in any way, you MUST have this book. The hardcover edition just makes it all the more sweet.
B00633W614|5.0|The entire 2 books are entriguing and keep you interested and wanting to read more .  After the 2 book I immediately ordered the third.  I can't wait until it is ready
B00BEIN9VO|4.0|So I purchased this understanding that it is being mass-produced for the masses- this isn't a limited edition Mofi pressing.  In the past this has frequently meant sacrificing the quality of the vinyl.  Luckily the vinyl here is much better than I expected!  Both discs suffer from slight \\"dishing\\" but not bad enough to prohibit clean playback.  I have listened to all four sides of the two discs and did not hear a single pop or click or crackle or anything(aside from when it is part of the song).  Overall, very good sound on this album.  The music is also pleasant.  JT isn't reinventing the wheel but that's ok cuz this is good music.  4 of 5 stars for the quality of the vinyl, 4 of 5 stars for the tunes overall.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|When I did have time to sit and read it definitely held my attention! It's a good love story...can't wait to read the next one.
0345525558|5.0|The Language of Flowers makes a great book club read. Although, it was heart wrenching at times, I liked how flowers and their meaning were a big part of the book.  Ann author of Grandmother's Flower Garden  [[...]]
B004JN1CW4|3.0|These books had some good initial ideas but became overburdened with difficult to describe/imagine &#34;things.&#34;  Each book seems to re-hash the same initial ideas with nothing new and the characters aren't good enough to keep me coming back for more.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|What a lovely yarn....great twist at the end. This book left me with a smile. Off to the movies now!!
B00ADS98FC|5.0|This movie was very good. We thought it was funny and entertaining. Can't wait for part two if they make one.
B00BI73CVI|4.0|I loved the music as usual, but this version was more concise than previous versions.  So much easier to follow!
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|Ted was hilarious. Mark Walberg and Teddy Puxspin were sensational together.  Many Times I saw Teddy as a real person.<br />The direction was superb.  The language was insensitive, but only inappropriate for younger children.
B00000J7S8|5.0|I have played this cd every night since I received it. If you are looking for something relaxing before bed this is it. Also you could play this during a romantic evening. Pull your partner close in your arms and dance to put you both in a romantic mood. I liked Let's face the music and dance and I'll string along with you. Her suprise song at the end of the cd is not listed in the name of the tracks. But it is a really great song. It's from the movie True Crime with Clint Eastwood. It's called Why sould I care and it is my favorite song on the cd. I highly recommend this to jazz lovers.
1616550414|5.0|After a long wait for america's release, finally got my copy. The presentation is superb, the book is huge, the cover is gorgeous with the door of time design in shiny gold and the paper quality are really great. Overall a breath-taking item that any Zelda fan MUST own.<br />If you are willing to buy this, you already may know what to expect in the contents. If you don't know, don't expect to read just the story only like a tale, it's more like a huge special issue of a videogame magazine.<br /><br />Speaking of contents, it is divided in 4 main sections, the first one is an explanation of the creative process and development of Skyward Sword from the scratch (take in mind that the original release of this book in japan was almost at the same time of the Skyward Sword launch, so you will find a lot of SS oriented content), the second one (the most interesting IMO) is about the long waited and polemic chronology in the series, briefly explained with a lot of pictures, the third section is a compilation of design sketches from all the games and the last one is a really well done manga, a prelude to skyward sword.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you know what Zelda is and what to expect buying this book, it won't dissapoint you.<br /><br />PS: A lot of people complain about the packaging in Amazon, i live in Mexico and yes, it came with a little damage in the corners, but i know that the people at aduana (i don't know the term in english lol) have no caution with this kind of packags, is not Amazon's fault.
B00BF11STU|1.0|there were no closed captions available on amazon. this movie needs closed captions as there is a lot of talking and it is hard to understand what the actors talk because of the background noise. I ended up purchasing rental on att uverse for the same amount, but with closed captions so that I could follow the movie. amazon does state clearly whether closed captions are available for not.<br />very disappointed with amazon video in this case.
B00ARX2W24|5.0|Herb Alpert made one of the best works with this album. You'll enjoy it because it has the essence of the TJB and the amazing trumpet of Mr. Alpert. Songs like &#34;Fandango&#34;, &#34;Route 101&#34;, &#34;Push and pull&#34;, &#34;Quiereme tal como soy&#34;, etc. I recommend this album to anyone who likes latin sound.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Incredible easy read that doesn't feel like a novel.  The perfect blend of life meets fiction.  the perfect flow for any reader.
178022219X|3.0|interesting concept. nature vs. nurture. and do we know who are children really are. what are we willing to believe?
B00BEPVAV8|1.0|All other games on my Kindle Fire work except this one. Deleted it off Kindle and reinstalled. Still does not work.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I enjoyed the way the story opened up at key turning points along the way, several times.  Story hooked me in and I read the collection over 4-5 days.<br /><br />Get it if you enjoy post-apocalyptic science fiction and fast-moving, light prose.<br /><br />I'd buy it again!
B004TI5N38|3.0|Rather boring. Not a cliff hanger. Finished it but not worth the time. First 3/4 had nothing happen. I've read decent Baldacci's but this wasn't one of them
B00BI73CVI|5.0|Saw this on Broadway and loved it. After that I didn't expect to be thrilled again. But I was!  Plan to see again and again!
B004SBQAN8|5.0|Ever since I originally caught this movie on Direct TV, I have wanted my own copy. One of the better, entertaining Sci-Fi movies I have seen. I like the humor and soft romance combined with action, similar in balance to the Transformer series. It doesn't break any ground with respect to plot, social message or acting. Just a light hearted, fast paced fun movie to watch and feel good about after its finished.<br /><br />I hope they make a sequel to follow up on the characters fate in the future.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|No disrespect here - my parents used to call him Old Man Bowie because I became a huge fan of his work when I was only eight years old, and they couldn't understand why I would like someone who was their age :)<br />Bowie has made a wonderful album. Very diverse, and it is the kind of album that has to grow on you. On the first listen, I wasn't convinced the latter part of the album was really my cup of tea, but as it was with 'Where Are We Now?' (which I wasn't wild about on the first listen either), these songs stick to you and won't let go. I keep playing it while writing, driving, reading - and it just keeps getting better and better. Well done. I hope he'll release more stuff, because he clearly hasn't lost his touch yet!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I'm so glad its here ive been sick of the cheap versions of minecraft pe. so thank you minecraft pocket edition.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|I started watching this show because I love Sons of Anarchy and that show's creator Kurt Sutter was a writer on The Shield. I have also discovered that many cast members from The Shield have guest starred on SOA. The Shield is a great twist on the police drama!
B0063GORYU|3.0|Just the average spider game. It seems to be right in step with the ohter games. I would probably get it again.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|This was a really good book.  It had me on pins and needles.  Somewhat predictable, but I find just about everything I read that way.
B0091REZMW|3.0|its a pretty good app. wish you could get dimonds without having to spend real money other then that it is fun to play.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|I Enjoyed reading this classic over the summer holidays. It still makes me cry. I dark and twisted love story.
B00318CV28|2.0|The DVD looked great. However, it took a long time to arrive and then my DVD would not play it. It displayed \\"Wrong Region\\" . Maybe my DVD does not recognize EURO region format.
B005LCYR7Y|4.0|Enjoyed this books interesting look back in history and the 1950's - 1960's in America. Stephen KIng at his best but ending a little weak.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I found this book very informative on the possibility of life after death. It was a more compelling argument with scientific backup for what happened. It was more comprehensive in its description than most near death reports.
B008EKOO46|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much because it forced me to look at my own life and modern society in a different way. I was inspired by the simple ideas and systems of dealing with life's problems that have existed for thousands of years in smaller societies, but now to us seem almost profound in some ways. Also, seeing life's challenges in relation to survival of the individual, the family, or the group through the eyes of this book made me take a strong look at the way that we as a group (and myself as an individual) in a modern society have been overly judgmental towards others for their own practices and beliefs, for no good reason. The recognition of the &#34;degradation of health and well being&#34; in our own WEIRD modern societies was also a strong wake up call that all of us should heed, if we want to avoid succumbing to the modern plagues of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Overall, one of Jared Diamond's best books that provides for introspection and thoughtful insights!
B00BEZTMQ8|1.0|Again this is another Ultraviolet copy with no itune file. The studios are complaining about lower DVD sales and then they shoot themselves in the foot by not offering an itunes file. Who's minding the store? Not anyone with forethought.<br /><br />I saw this movie in the theatre and was suprised that some parts were very slow and boring. No wonder! The studio is treating us like saps expecting us to watch 3 different movies made from one book. The could have made as 1 movie or 2 at the most. I guess they're greedy, or think we're ignorant, or both.<br /><br />What a bummer!
B002SAUCBC|4.0|i had read this book years ago in hardcover and bought it again for my kindle  did not disappoint re reading  as with all King books it holds your interest from start to finish
B004TI5N38|3.0|I DO miss the David Baldacci who wrote Absolute Power.  That book was flawless and I could not put it down.<br />I recently re-read that one (his first)—SO incredibly good!  Many of his recent books have been lackluster and I rarely feel that I cannot put it down—a couple of them I never even finished. I had not read Zero Day...thus I recently ordered it from Amazon and felt  sure it would be a winner.  Alas!  Not so.
B00005QGAT|5.0|This is one of Michael's greatest cds  wonderful music makes you want to dance and sing along. Just love Michael
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|I love my Kindles but resent having to pay for necessary connections....I don't understand what an outfit, so customer savvy in so many ways, stoops to doing this....
B00005QGAX|5.0|Another great cd - wonderful music makes you want to dance and sing along. Just love Michael Jackson's music. Wonderful!
B007BFSYMS|4.0|I downloaded this app cause it was free, ran the setup tonight,  customized it (or at least tried) but the one flaw for me prevents me from using it over the stock alarm clock that comes with my Samsung Galaxy S III and that is the ability to create custom names for different alarms.<br /><br />I have alarms set for different days of the week at at different times and by simply looking at the phone can see by the name of the alarm why the thing is going off,  medication time, time for work, ect. This app doesn't allow that and that won't work for me no matter how cool the thing sounds.<br /><br />I am rating it 4 stars as a result, change that and I will reinstall it.<br /><br />I can see this as being a first class app for someone who just needs a simple alarm clock though.
B000WS4QJG|5.0|This is his greatest CD of all.  Love it, love it, love it.  Makes you really want to dance, dance, dance.
B009XY97VC|3.0|OK for background music, but not as outstanding to me as other reviewers describe.  The mix was not that good either.
B00BWI3NIU|3.0|I've been listening to Dido ever since \\"No Angel\\" and I've generally loved all of her albums so far. And while I do like this one, it's unfortunate to me to say that this album is a mixed bag.<br /><br />The highlights of this album for me are \\"Love to Blame,\\" \\"Go Dreaming,\\" and \\"Loveless Heart.\\" The song \\"Loveless Heart\\" would fit in with Dido's first album, it has the exact same vocal style, something I haven't heard from Dido in years. \\"Go Dreaming\\" is one of those songs I want to turn up loud whenever it is on. \\"Love to Blame\\" is great as well.<br /><br />But the other songs are a mixed bag. The lead single \\"No Freedom\\" is bland and somewhat boring, especially for a radio single that's supposed to make us want to buy the album. The other song that could be technically classified as a single is \\"Let Us Move On\\" which starts out great, but all goes downhill as soon as a rapper comes on and ruins everything. Kendrick Lamar (the rapper who guests on the song) reminds me of a drunk uncle in an otherwise beautiful wedding. A wedding on a beautiful day, that's otherwise perfect, and the drunk uncle comes in and ruins everything. Like the drunk uncle, Kendrick Lamar in \\"Let Us Move On\\" is unwanted, unnecessary, and ruins something that was otherwise great.<br /><br />Another song that is a pain to listen to is Blackbird. The song starts out with Dido stuttering (literally). After 20 seconds of stuttering, Dido sings lyrics that could have came from a five year old (\\"He put the coffee in the cup and with milk he filled it up. He added sugar and I never knew he liked it like that\\"). Just what was she thinking? The rest of the song is actually great once you get passed the embarrassment of the beginning.<br /><br />The rest of the songs on the album are average. I can't say I'd recommend the entire album, but you could do a lot worse than this one. There are some songs that are just hard to listen to, but there are some songs that are great. I highly recommend streaming this album first before buying it.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I could listen to this one CD forever!!!! Keep up the good work I can wait for more!! More please!!!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|it was an awesome game, but one day when I went to go play it, didn't let me!!!!! :( but other then that it is a great game
B008AK8FHM|4.0|For those who want to believe and feel science is working against believers. The doctor's experience rebuts science and the culture of the medical profession to only believe the science
B00519YRH2|1.0|Its the worst Magic-gives-kid-what-he-wants-then-discovers-its-not-right movie ever made. If you think about long enough you'll throw up, a thirteen yearold gets a mans body and uses it to get a 30yr old girlfriend. Even after she discovers hes a child, she continues the physical asspect of the relationship. I hated it, hope you take this advice and steer clear of this pedifiles wonder.
B0091REZMW|4.0|great eye coordination response. keeps you looking and your imagination in high gear. keeps your interest and continued vigilance at all times
B002E66C6E|3.0|This is your typical submarine movie with long intervals of complete silence and random shots of sweaty dudes, then someone yells, &#34;DEPTH CHARGES!&#34; and the silence erupts into sweaty dudes falling and loud explosions... this cycle continues for a very long time, honestly quite annoying.
B00BYOEZTI|5.0|Movie was great and long...That's what she said. Can't wait for the next one to come out! Hurry up Peter!!
1439153663|5.0|This is a fabulous book of historical fiction. I am almost sorry that I am almost finished with it. I think about it each day and can't wait to get back to it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My 5 year old daughter and I play this together. She just started real horse riding lessons and this game mirrors the things she's learning about care, grooming and competition. Amazing game.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|You get hooked from the very beginning in all the seasons.<br />so if uve seen the first 4 season u better not miss this one
B000FC1AGG|5.0|Sophie Kinsella writes light comedy and is very entertaining when you want to laugh as you read;  I've enjoyed all her books so far; they remind me of the Bridget Jones stories with a heroine who is flawed but accepting of her flaws and very funny in her take on life and companions.  Always looking for her new novels to read after a darker or more serious read.
0811879542|4.0|Very cute idea for a book; my 11 year old loves it! She asked for it for her birthday and was really happy that I got it or her.
B001XUIBNO|5.0|The picture quality was excellent and the film is a classic. I would watch it again and I would recommend it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is fun, but not as fun as I had hoped.  I play it occasionally, but nearly as often as other games
B000065V3H|5.0|This is a must own movie. Very reasonably priced and received movie in mail very quickly from merchant also. Great buy.
B0086700CM|4.0|I still play this from time to time, but I got bored of it very quickly.  There are worse games out there
B004G600A4|5.0|This is one of the cutest and must have movies ever. I bought this for my seventeen year old daughter and this is one of her favorite movies ever. Highly recommend.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|best book i ever read so yeah get this series and you will not regret it trust me..... get it
B005LAII62|5.0|Very reasonably priced movie and quick shipping for Christmas. Cute movie to add to your collection but probably for older kids viewing because of zombies. I would recommend adding to your collection.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This game was a fun waste of time. I especially liked the movements of the monkey. It was creative to have him interact with the game format not just the game itself.
B00AEFXXMI|5.0|Who could go wrong with this eighties flick? This is a must have that even our kids love. Very quick shipping and reasonably priced movie.
B00BEZTMQ8|1.0|I really liked the movie, but would prefer more options when it comes to the digital version.  I dislike UltraViolet and would prefer an itunes version.
B008CLI3TE|5.0|GAME OF THRONES IS AMAZING!!! I LOVE IT!! GET IT RIGHT NOW!!! ITS EPIC!!!! STOP READING THIS REVIEW AND BUY IT NOW!!!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This book was such an unbelievable novel. Its plot was simple, but that only further enhanced the clarity of its message. The message is one that many people think about constantly, but this book captures it and puts it into words. I will say without hesitation that this book changed my life. Even though I am always thinking, thinking about time, how I used to (and sometimes still do) want it to go faster, how later in life (and sometimes now) will be longing for the past, to turn back time, and how there never seems to be enough of it, I realize now that the truth is that there is. There is always not too much or too little time, but just the right amount, and each moment is precious.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Awesome game i like zipline and graphics quality BUT on Kindle Tablet its pic shows for a second before it turns to a grey square on the Carousel... still five stars for game quality even if it's the app and not the kindle's fault
B008M36EEI|5.0|I am a huge Ewan McGregor fan because of his sensitive portrayals and he doesn't disappoint - in fact, his acting was superb! Emily Blunt also has a beautiful inward spirit which shines through during the whole film. The subject matter was an extremely powerful one, where people are trying to bring others a better way of life. Tim W.
B00BYOEZTI|3.0|See above. Movie is good tho not able to finish since getting Content error warning at 40 minutes into video. Please address~!!<br /><br />I could get this video elsewhere at cheaper rate and maybe it even plays all the way to end.  I also am frustrated as it appears I was billed twice for a movie i can not see all of since the content error notice keeps me from viewing most of the show. Please contact to assist!!!!
B009K86D86|5.0|Food Inc. sheds light on the unscrupulous practices in the agribusiness. You will learn things industry would rather you not know. You might even go vegetarian like me. This film finally pushed me over the edge.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|If you are searching for a movie with a good story, great action and an awesome ending.....this is certainly  it!
034580404X|5.0|I liked the books because they were a great read, takes you out of the box!!!!!!!!!!!<br />Try something new, you just might like it!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|The movie is a real thriller keeps you on the eage of the seat also a real eye opener if it would ever come to real
B002Z58GQS|5.0|This is a great product. I used it everyday for school to bring my files back and forth. I love the fact that its purple. couldn't be happier. i actually lost it awhile ago but i am planning on buying a new one soon. totally worth the price!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is such a good book, one of my favorite (and, I read a lot)...I would highly recommend this to everyone.
B005LAIIGC|4.0|This movie was super cute and I think it had a great message of strength, patience, and the power of one. I gave it four stars because it was a bit rushed and I don't think each character was represented equally. I suppose every movie has its heros but it would have been great to get a little more information about each character. All in all, a great movie for Kids and a few laughs for adults as well. I love that all of those holidays heros got a make over. I think it will give a new coolness to our younger generations.
B00368CQ6Y|5.0|The main advantage of this engine is the magnets both on front and back. Because of this you can use another battery  engine up front and put this one five cars back and make for a super long train. Does ok on hills too. I'd like to get another to make for a massive convoy.
0439023521|5.0|Okay, I don't know why, but for some reason I thought of this as a book geared toward children when I picked it up. I know, crazy. Because there is so much violence and action in this, it can't be for anyone under the teenage years. Once that was established, I was more than happy to begin. I've been meaning to read it for a while and have heard nothing [NOTHING] bad about this book. I was not disappointed at all!<br />To start off, Katniss is a very likable character, if a little harsh. But that's to be expected, fending for your family after your father dies. She is very independent, doesn't take no for an answer, and isn't afraid to stand up for herself. I loved reading from her point of view.<br />There were several points of this book that could have turned very, very cliche. Because, I mean, Katniss is the main character. That means she can't die-right? Well, you have to read to find out, because luckily Suzanne Collins saved the day by crafting interesting plot twists that took the book to new levels and leaving me hungry [haha] for more.<br />This book was addicting from the start. I started it Saturday night, and finished it today, Wednesday. If it wasn't for school, this would have been finished much earlier. I'm already itching to read the next one, while \\"The Hunger Games\\" only ended for me mere hours ago! I need to get to a book store...<br />\\"The Hunger Games\\" gets 5/5 stars. It is excellent and should be read be anyone and everyone.
B0086449YA|4.0|Good two CD offering, good price. Anything by Mark is acceptable or better. He's beginning to sound like Bob Dylan, and compared to previous songs, even a seemingly simple one like Boom Like That, there's not as much guitar rift magic lately. He can probably roll off the newer songs more quickly? Still, I welcome his &#34;stuff.&#34;
B0083J3JMG|5.0|Connelly has created a great character-part street-lawyer (out of the back seat of his beloved tricked out Lincoln Continental/office), and part financially successful criminal attorney. Early in the series the reader had to wonder about a cash-only criminal attorney who cruised the streets in his office-on-wheels. But, the man is ethical and professional, and untiring in his devotion to his clients receiving all of their legal rights. By this most recent novel, a reader's doubt about his style of practicing law is way in the back of the mind, and the focus is on the story. Which has the twists and turns of big city streets.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Very addictive! Just wish there were lighter color backgrounds<br /> available.Can the ad location be on the opposite side to the pieces?
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|&#34;Wreck It Ralph&#34; is a terrific blend of kid/adult entertainment (although you may have to explain to your kids what a &#34;video arcade&#34; is!). This should have won the Oscar over Brave, considering its 100x better.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Book was a good read... but not a page turner. I would recommend to read. Interesting facts about the Pacific Coast Trail.
B00AOMR2S2|5.0|Great movie. Lots of one liners that are hilarious. Great songs too. Will occasionally watch the end sequence as a pick me up... Lol.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I thought that with a title like that it would be crappy.  I really enjoyed.  The Zombie war was the backdrop for the story about war, human reaction to major catastrophe.  DO NOT be put off by the title
B00BSBXZDY|5.0|Good movie for adults with a bit of adult humor thrown in. A very sweet, funny, heartwarming film. Plus Hugh Jackman is great as the Easter bunny.
030758836X|1.0|From the opening through the painfully predictable storyline and up to the pitiful ending this is one of the most ridiculous books I've ever wasted time on.<br />Unbelievable and totally unlikeable characters set within an equally unbelievable scenario.<br />There are no twists, no turns and absolutely nothing unexpected - total drivel without a redeeming feature.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|Save your money.  I was hoping to use this while offline as well as hoping an easier way  to print. No such luck. Plus there are times the app doesn't open at all.  What a waste of my money.
B001VTTRC6|3.0|This is a very long movie. That seems to drag but it you can watch it it not bad.<br />Sean peen plays a good role in this movie.
B00BF11STU|4.0|the intelligence gathering part is why I watched it...that part was great.  I wish the end would have been a little different.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Love this game,  got it for my kindle, and since I downloaded this game, I hardly ever read.. which is why I got the Kindle.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|love love love this trilogy...there is a really great story in there.  I am really interested to see how they will make a movie that will come even close to how well the books are written.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|trick of cleaning all of the junk off of my Kindle Fire. The Clean Master cleans your tracks on the WEB and cleans your Cache, Unused files, privacy and app package. It's a keeper!!!
B0053TMP24|5.0|I thought that it was a good book. It also is better than the Percy Jackson series. I thought it was a little bit better than the first book. I really want to get the next book as soon as I can.
B007HACDLK|5.0|My first ever Vince Flynn novel and it lived up to all the other reviews and went beyond my expectations.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER.  IN MY OPINION JUST TOO MUCH DETAIL IN THE SEXUALITY.  LOVE IS GREAT, BUT TOO MUCH EXPLICIT SEXUAL CONTENT SEEMED TO MAKE ME WANT TO QUIT.  GLAD IT'S OVER.
B00C0OOV5O|5.0|Ah!  Zombies and their rotting and its awesome because they eat people that cant run very fast.  Stupid if they dont get food from the store but nobody stocks the shelves if zombies eat them!  Ah!!  Theres electricity so thats good because if there wasnt they couldnt have food that was hot and the zombies can smell smoke so it makes them even scarier!  I like this show because its about the way people are when their being eaten by zombies and nobody some people want to die but they have babies too!  I SURE AM GLAD THERE ARE NO BABY ZOMBIES BECAUSE ZOMBIE SEX IS GROSS!!!  Watch it so you can see what its like if zombies eat everybody except for a couple people who should learn to eat the zombies back!  They need more boobs because sometimes they make the story more real and I would understand because if I was living with a lot of zombies who want to eat my brain I would make sure there were more boobs because WHY ELSE WOULD YOU BE ALIVE EXCEPT TO HAVE MORE PEOPLE TO KILL THE ZOMBIES!?!
B007OV9EYG|5.0|This review is mostly about the 3d effect and not the story.  Last night we watched this fun  movie on our 3d tv and we were quite impressed with the technology of home theatre 3d tv. The videography is terrific, rich beautiful colors, vivid images, little to no crosstalk, non stop action and countless out of the screen effects that synced well with the deep in screen pics throughout the majority of the flick. Some of the movie is staged in the world surrounding their life in a bubble and is much less colorfull and slightly dark, but is still very good and entertaining as can be. The 5.1 dts+dolby surround sound we have really added another dimension as it was produced very well for this movie.  The movie in 3d is a must for showing off your 3d tv capability, its was very entertaining for us adults and I'll bet will mezzmerize our grand kids ! I know this movie will be viewed over and over again!
0375714839|5.0|Anyone who thinks that a graphic book must be nothing more than a cartoon would be well advised to read \\"Persepolis.\\"  It's an extraordinarily moving work, possibly all the more so for being in graphic format.  It's also funny and scary and just wonderful.  I'd had it on my shelf for several years and decided it was time to \\"tackle\\" it, and I'm glad I did.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Bad app. Always saying network error and then when you reset you'd WiFi modem it still gives you problems. I don't like the app.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I'm very happy with Feedly as a replacement for Google Reader. I find I'm processing all feeds faster than I did with the Google Reader interface, effectively spending less time in the RSS weeds. I should have switched a long time ago.
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved these books! Just wish the new one came out this fall instead of next spring! Either way I will be buying it too! Can't wait to read more about Mr. Christian Grey!
B003TTKB5I|5.0|Great entertainment --fun--a bit sexy, a bit overly dramatic-just enough medical correctness to keep a nurse happy! Yes, I know I am the last one to find out that this series is a keeper!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is lots of fun. I really st enjoy it and it's like my favorite game. I'm glad I took my brothers advice and downloaded it!! I think if you like fun racing games you would really enjoy this game!!:)
0756666937|5.0|My 7 year old grandson loved knowing the background of the lego system. He continues to enjoy the pictures and the family story of the lego company.
B00003CXA6|5.0|I have had the movie Gettysburg on VHS for years and wore it out. So as not to lose it I purchased it on DVD.<br />I watch this movie on a regular basics about once a month.
B0055B7IPE|4.0|Yes, it is billed as a kids movie--but us old folks enjoyed it! Nothing too strenuous or sad just light and easy.
0061684384|5.0|Kat Von D have a confuse history but who care I bought The book cause this and I loved her history and her fight for The world art.
0307463745|3.0|A friend had me read a chapter of this book on workaholism and since I agreed with every word, I decided to purchase the book. Unfortunately, there were only about 3 of this &#34;AHA&#34; moment chapters - the rest were not things that could really work with most employers or they were nothing close to &#34;AHA&#34; moments. I wouldn't spend the money a second time around.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I picked this book for my bookclub month. Everyone in my group loved it and we have some reluctant readers. It really generated some great discussion. I even baked the cake at the end of the book and made brandied peaches to go with it. All the girls liked it as well.
B004BDC9F6|5.0|I am enjoying the music on my kindle fire hd.  While I play a game, I listen to it.  It gets tiresome listening to the same music and sound effects with games.
B004YOEFG8|3.0|It's fun for demonstrating 3D in Space and that's about it. One of the collection but I'm afraid it won't be viewed too often.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Really enjoyed this.  Am watching other seasons.  Thanks so much for being able to watch season 2 of such good programing.
0553582445|3.0|I read the original assassin series and haven't finished Fool's errand yet, and even though I have<br />alot of respect for Ms. Hobb's talent, I am already annoyed even more than I was before by the obvious fact that Fitz is not a male character, but rather a female who appears to be a man.  He is described as being very interested and attentive to domestic and logistical details, that leave male readers puzzled as to why they are in the book at all, but more importantly, he does something that is a hallmark of feminine as opposed to male mentality -- in his thinking he continually places himself in a nexus of relationships, or memories of relationships that frankly, a man wouldn't do, or if he did, it would be quicker and less sentimental.  Before I get labeled as a sexist, I am not saying judging either mentality as better or worse, etc. they are simply different, and Fitz definitely has a feminine mentality.<br /><br />Another thing thats annoying; Nighteyes appears to have the thought vocabulary of a human being -- so he's also not a wolf. So my point is that there are numerous beings in the Farseer books that seem to have completely different genders and species, but are actually human females in disguise.  Does that invalidate the stories or make them less interesting as a whole? Not really.  But I find the chacterizations to be so far off the mark that it interferes with the telling of the story. Perhaps an author such as GMM makes corresponding errors in describing women, but somehow I think not.
B0007MWZEK|4.0|Love the sweeper. But...the battery charger doesn't work. Fortunately, had an old battery charger. This is second sweeper I've had.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|*-have always loved this movie as well as Jon Heder! Glad to finally own it :)) Vote for Pedro! lol
B0062OCNAI|5.0|I really enjoyed this book very much. I'm not usually a fan of contrivance, but the depth and beauty of the writing here really had me taking a second read many times throughout the book. I was sad to reach the end. I liked it even more than her first book, so I look forward to a third!
159562015X|3.0|we bought this book for each employee where I work to find our strengths - it may have been accurate although when it is yourself looking at it, you tend not to think so.  In any event, accurate or not, it didn't seem to have any long-term affect on our ways of working with one another - which was the point of the exercise - so not sure it was worth it
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|this game rocks but every time I advance sharks it just puts me down to thenlast shark and starts.me over

B0010SKUYM|5.0|Good read no great read..love the play of words in this book. Please buy and appreciate cause its worth it
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I love this movie, its a DVD, its great. Got here pretty fast! One of my fav movies and i even read the books after i watched the first one.
B0012X69SG|5.0|Sinopoli is an overlooked interpreter of Mahler, I believe. His opera conducting experience should be expected to give him more credit with the listening public when it comes to Mahler's symphonies and song cycles, which have such a great vocal element. This set has wonderful production values, and I find the comments of some that Sinopoli's vision of Mahler is too slow or eccentric, etc is undeserved. I felt he kept the rhythm tight, and the music benefits as well as my insight into Mahler. I also have the two Bernstein cycles, some of Jansons, the Abbado, and I put this cycle right up with any of them. I would highly recommend
B00BF11STU|4.0|Development pace was a little arduous given we know the outcome of the movie. We done and authentic in scene.
B007PP2J9I|5.0|Of the two books I have read from Mark Russinovich this is the best book I have read so far.  This book was very hard to put down.
B0062P3392|4.0|i ordered for my collection of jason statham tapes and was pleased.he played a good part in the c/d.larry natelli
B00AW0KHMY|5.0|Blue Ray is so much better. One has to see both versions to really appreciate the difference. There's no comparison.<br /><br />Having the digital version in addition to the discs is a major plus... no more having to pack around DVDs! I can watch it on my iPad or iPhone!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Done very well.  I never cried so much.  Makes you feel you were right there.  The music was great.  The actors and actresses were great.
B002QW7ALM|4.0|Dennis Quaid is one of today's great actors. He is such a versatile actor too.... contemporary, sci-fi, drama, thriller, very good at any roles.
B00A7OIXW6|3.0|A game that was played on the computer.  More for kids than adults.  A game that wrecks things and the other fixes it.
0785134352|4.0|I would give this item a 5 out 5 for the novel itself but mine came with a few damages to the paper cover over the actually hardcover, but i truly recommend this item to any kick ass fan or comic book fan in general.
B003E2UQMS|4.0|I love the story because it is so real to me. I can relate to the characters of Pat and Tiffany. As a bipolar myself, it was very encouraging to see beautiful normal looking people like Pat and Tiffany can be affiliated with mental disorders as well. So God is not totally unfair, not that I dare to judge God. I know they are beautiful because Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper played those characters. Ha ha ha. Like Pat, I spent a considerable amount of time in the bad place but have amnesiac experience of it all losing consciousness of time and space because of a series of ECT treatments before I was stabilized with medication and accepting my condition and who I am. The book teaches many gems for happiness in life. Leaving the past, accepting reality and moving forward and excepting the silver lining that God has installed for us and not the one we expect. The other gem is life does not always have happy fairy tale  endings. Sooner we learn this the better equip we are with life. Nevertheless, Pat has good things going for him on his path to recovery. 1. Supportive and loving parents and brother and sister in law and friends. 2. Good therapist. 3. Doting beautiful fellow mental girl who loves him 4. and last but not least good long term medication.
B001ANSSDC|1.0|Very easy reading and kept interest throughout.  Having this available on Kindle is the best since I can take with me anywhere
B009FZHYKU|5.0|You know, I only recently started watching this show about 3 weeks ago now. I am all caught up to current and have found that this show has improved quite a bit with age.<br /><br />The acting, the makeup, the story lines ... Impressive.<br /><br />I wanted to give 4 stars because the constant and ever-flowing drama that these folks have can be a bit frustrating and unbelievable but I guess it keeps the us watching.<br /><br />5 stars for the dramatic improvements especially to the way the zombies behave and move.
B00785P2QC|5.0|virtual city playground has been fun so far. it was very easy to start playing and the hint feature leads you along
0316056898|3.0|This was a bookclub pick. I am only accquainted with Tina Fey through her imitation of Sarah Palin since I have not watched SNL since the early days of the program, or Thirty Rock. Reading the book was like reading a cleverly written Christmas letter from a casual acquaintance and not knowing knowing anyone she was talking about. Not for people over a &#34;certain age&#34;.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Very interesting game to match up everything to get the cards gone all at one time. Not as easy as it seems.
0307341550|2.0|I have to admit that I'm only on the 3rd of 8 audiobook discs, but finding it agonizing to continue this macabre, joyless story. Even the prime character has an extremely troubled past and present. The narrator is stellar though. Her haunting presentation transmits the utter despair of the story. Honestly, I think the author needs some professional psychological help. No one should have this much experience with sadness, depression and pain, and also think it's a good idea to write about it...
B006MW3V6U|5.0|can't wait to watch season 3! Such an addicting, witty, smart and educational show about the times and history! love it
B00BRR66SA|4.0|I really thought this was a well put together album.  I really liked the extended tracks and it makes for an album that you can sit down and listen to all the way through.  Very impressive.
B005IQZB14|4.0|I thought that maybe there would be slow spots in this book, but was pleasantly surprised that every page held my interest.  Even when nothing was happening around her, she always had something very interesting going on in her head!  I really liked the way she wrote.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|The movie went beyond my expectations! I can't wait to order the second season....Game of Thrones has got to be the best tv series i have seen in a long time!
B00B69UQEO|2.0|Discovering that your musical heroes have lost their sense of quality control feels strangely like when you discover that your parent has started to \\"lose their marbles\\".  And I thought their last one was a masterpiece.  This would have been better as a single with the 2-3 good songs from the sessions.  Please don't let this be their last.  They can't go out like this.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|The movie went beyond my expectations! I thought that the producers went beyond my expectations in the first season but this 2nd season was even better than the 1st.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love that there are nearly endless possibilities with the combinations of sounds with this app. I have used it to promote relaxation in many environments, for meditation and even to help a nervous 10 year old get to sleep. Very useful.
B009CPJHY4|3.0|I enjoyed watching this movie for the most part.  However, it did drag a little in places and it also got a little tiresome when they kept focusing on everyone's angst.  It was very colorful and the location shots were fabulous.
B0081336FO|5.0|Not a bad or mediocre episode!  Always a treat to watch!  Keep 'em coming.  I can't wait for season #3!!!!!!
B00APUQT7I|5.0|As in all he Ice Age movies, this was again a funny, belly laughing ride.  My children are all grown up but still like these movies.  Also made a hit with my Grandson!
B00499NHLC|5.0|I hope there are many more &#34;seasons&#34; in store!  Benedict & Martin work so well together & off of each other!!
B001NKI60W|5.0|Never got around to seeing this movie when it came out.  I wasn't sure I really wanted to even though I love the actors.  But now that I have seen it, I'll be buying it!  It is one of those movies you can see again and again.
B004XWLIJS|4.0|I've been a fan of Jason's since &#34;Lock, Stock....&#34;  and have rarely been disappointed but this one is probably my #2 favorite, right after Transporter.  Way to go, Jason!!!!!!
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|I chose this rating because i think the Jane Austin movies Persuasion and Sense & Sensibility had move action in them..
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Everything about this movie was special.  The cinematography was incredible as well as the story. Do yourself a favor and watch it.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This book is amazing, I finished it in 2 days.  You will literally not want to set it down until you are done. It's the perfect balance of love and evil.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|I started the book and decided that I couldn't keep up so I said, &#34;WATH THE SHOW!&#34; Best decision ever!! I brought my husband in and we subscribed to HBO so we could catch up and now watch live starting March 30!!
057809665X|5.0|This book is very insightful for anyone who deals with other people as their profession.  Most sales training books are focused on topics that don't really help that much.  This one cuts through and will help you to identify what your client/patient/customer/suspect is actually thinking.
B00005AXKF|1.0|This DVD was not made to be played on machines typically used in the United States. The company refused to reimburse the money paid and said they could not provide a product that would be used in the USA.<br /><br />A great disappointment to the grandchildren who were anticipating it.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Lacked continuity of first. Left me confused and wanting better explanation for certain events.  Glad series is finally over, can't take another book.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|So many options of sound to sleep or relax to. I have enjoyed falling asleep with this wonderful app. Thank you!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|First book I have read and finished in years!  What a wonderful read! I will be reading more Nicholas Sparks books. He does a wonderful job of keeping your interest throughout the book!  I cannot wait to see the movie.
B003O86FMW|5.0|love it!!  love ALL the books and characters.  Got my family and friends to read them- love everything about the hunger games!
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Would a DA really lie and hide evidence in a case?  I certainly hope not.  I always knew what was coming next.  No surprises.
B00AEBB8ZG|3.0|The only parts I like were the spa treatments & shopping she does in the movie; it could have been edited more
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|wonderful graphics and hunts. it was just challenging enough, but not so hard i wanted to give up. great story line.
B00000IREA|5.0|A must-own for all Jane Fonda fans; she was glamous and the musical score in the film was brilliant, too
0062238868|5.0|What I love about this book is that Chris Kyle is brutally honest.  Whether one agrees with his point of view or not is a different matter entirely.  However, I do have tremendous respect for his (or anyone else's) blunt talk, on the war and being a SEAL.  I don't care much to listen/read people who concern themselves with politically correctness because it is not honest - it's like having a muzzle on.  As such, Mr. Kyle paints a beautiful mess by sharing his experience(s) and highlights that despite all the training and bravado that comes with earning the right to be called a SEAL -- they are very much mortal.<br /><br />When I read this book, I can't believe people waste time reading non-fiction thrillers...this book has it all.  It may not be as articulate but who cares - it is true history.
B0007MWZEK|4.0|The sweeper delivered was an older model, not the model I expected. This was replacing a newer model with a swivel dust bin that had broken and the batteries  had given out. The sweeper works well and the price was right.
B000FCKIFU|3.0|This book is ok, just not as exciting as others. I found it did not hold my interest as his other books do.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think that this app is a great way to spend  your time. It has great graphics and is really fun!!!!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I like it because its a great time killer and its actually a lot of fun.the only reason that I don't love it is because is takes a little wile to load:(
B00BHMETKC|5.0|GREAT movie wish I hadn't waited so long to watch it however seeing on Amazon through my TV was just as GREAT.
B008MM9630|5.0|This game is total fun and cute. I love the little animals and I love to garden. This is my fave game.
B009AMANBA|3.0|The anticipation with which I awaited this film was greater than any other in recent memory.  As a great-great-great grandson of a Union soldier of the War, Lincoln held particular interest for me.<br /><br />Two things happened while I finally was able to see the film:  I waited, and I waited.  In one sense, I waited with vague hope as the minutes passed by that this would be a complex biography of a man intertwined with the unimaginable drama that was the Civil War.  Instead, I was greeted by snippets that satisfied this hope -- if but for a few minutes -- like the scene at the beginning between Abraham and the soldiers, the scenes with solely Abraham and Tad, Abraham and Mary, or Abraham and Robert.  These scenes were gems, and the story should have been based upon these interpersonal relationships.<br /><br />Sadly, the focus was shifted to the often yawn-inducing political drama of passing legislation. It is then, the majority of the movie, that I waited for either the end, or another satisfying snippet, mentioned earlier, to break the monotony. The title is a farce.  To claim the portrayl of the end months of Lincoln's life trying to pass the Amendment as worthy of the title \\"Lincoln\\" is not sufficient, in my opinion, and not as grand as should be required.  Portraying earlier times of his life, earlier struggles, earlier days of the War, more vivid depictions of slavery, a better fleshing-out of Mary Todd's character, and less political emphasis, would have made this film worthy of its title.<br /><br />That said, the film is saved, in some ways by brilliant period sets and costume and pure acting talent.  I thoroughly enjoyed Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Robert Todd.  Sally Field's Mary Todd was both overplayed and underplayed, but she looked the part.  I am reading a great biography about our former First Lady, and a greater emphasis on the depiction of her role on her husband's development was a sorely missed opportunity in the film.<br /><br />In a nutshell, lavish praise for aesthetics and good acting is in order, but the film should have drawn on the success of  its scenes that depicted the personal development, characterization, and family life of Abraham Lincoln, instead of relying on the Amendment's passing as the backbone of a story titled \\"Lincoln\\".<br /><br />I would recommend one to view this movie as a rental before buying, and, if satisfied at all by any portion of the film, to give careful consideration to buying it, as I doubt we will see another attempt at telling this tale in any motion picture any time soon.

B002OSY2T6|5.0|This toy is the best toy I have purchased for my infant.  We used it for Tummy Time with my niece and it works great.  The baby is stimulated and I get to take a little break.  The snail will talk if it feels the slightest vibration.  So if I walk past the toy it will talk and sing to baby without me having to bend down and move it.  She enjoyed playing with this toy up until her first birthday when it got passed on to the next little one in the family.  I recommend it for any new parent and I will be getting one for my little one on the way.

0783228007|5.0|Great movie - my husband watches it at least once a week. He enjoys and owns almost all Clint Eastwood movies.
B00A85EMVK|5.0|I find it ironic that one of the best 3D conversions I ever saw was on a catelogue title. They used an all new transfer, cleaning up issues with the previous Blu-Ray and HD-DVD releases, and the 3D depth is incredible! There are a couple of scenes where it seemed that they had some issues, mainly the ocean scene after they ejected (the 3D of the water looks weird), but the rest of the movie is absolutely incredible!<br /><br />The audio was also a surprise. There are several tracks to choose from (a huge upgrade from my HD-DVD copy), and they are agressive! The 6.1 track even took the 80s pop-music and pushed it to every single speaker. I have never seen that done on an 80s movie before. It sounds terrific, highly recommend.
B004S5FW1U|3.0|I found this rather average, almost had that thriller aspect to it but just didn't quite make it. An 'OK' read.
1401940676|5.0|This was an incredible book, and very much follows along the same path of self-awareness I have been traveling for the past year or two. Anita is well spoken, and I love that she read the book herself, as I think it lends to an understanding of what she went through. My feeling on the reading of this type of book is this: if you've chosen to read it, you are probably looking for something more in this life or looking for a different way to have this human experience. You can take what you like from this, and leave what doesn't serve you. And in the end, if she (and many others who carry this same message) was wrong, would living your life full of love and compassion for yourself and everyone around you be so bad? I'm going with no on that, for me personally. Happy Reading!

B009S33I68|5.0|This should be mandatory reading for all of the soft citizens and bleeding heart pacifists of this country who believe that we do not need a strong military and most of whom have already forgotten 9/11 because it is easier to forget and wish that everyone would get along than to be strong and defend the principals we were brought up to believe in.  It is evident that the politicians in this country would rather destroy our principals and rights than to stand up for right and risk there cushy jobs as we see this trend developed and evolve from Vietnam thru today.  ENOUGH SAID

0061692042|5.0|The reviewers of this work who seem to consternate over the seemingly drawn out digressions and pre-pubescent ramblings and insights that Richard Ford presents here as our protagonist, a very disoriented and unsettled fifteen year old boy, to me, miss the entire intent and scope of this otherwise monumental story by this cherished and awarded American author who is a Pulitzer and PEN/Faulkner winner. Herein, I found this work to be a very dark and melancholic tale told in an otherwise appealing third person voice of a seemingly detached sixty six year old who becomes, finally, ready to disclose the horrific episode from his long ago past with an alacrity and cleansing spirit that begs for exoneration while admitting culpability to a pair of horrific acts committed in the summer of 1960 without his acknowledged participation or concurrence, but with his certain knowledge and first hand view.<br /><br />Dell Parsons is our purveyor of the story and the subsequent window into the realm of what is morally right and wrong. Through him, we're lead into the the only real action in this novel but more importantly, through him we see the true introspective worth of this book in the very action that Dell takes as he, at fifteen and still figuring out why life deals him such complications, attempts to understand first why he's here and then, as he settles, attempts to understand the myriad personalities surrounding him.<br /><br />Ford to me really reaches his literary zenith here when he probes Dell's misanthropic yearnings as a misplaced Canadian, attempting to settle into his newfound surroundings. Displaying a maturity perhaps a tad beyond his years, Dell nonetheless provides us with introspective insights that carry this work and lead the reader along to the next literary epiphany. I believe Ford's ability to delve into Dell's inner being while probing his inner conflict, albeit as yet misunderstood due to his young age, are somewhat prodigious while still being entirelydismissed by reviewers as filler or insignificant. Readers here really need to delve into this prose and this section of the book as principal as it leads to important points further in the story.<br /><br />Two important physical occurrences go on to frame the book and are responsible for our protagonists' outcome, but my opinion still is the self-analysis and reflection that is pervasive throughout. I loved Ford's ability to probe the human condition even though it initiates with a fifteen year old. Also to my surprise and joy, the prose continued throughout the book to tell the story in an almost Cormac McCarthy-esque language. The verbage was spare but filled nonetheless with wisdom and erudition that took many pages of reading to appreiate. My view also, of this work is of a stark and abandoned human drama beautifully told and laid out...Richard Ford, to me, continues his dominance over these small town/small people stories with Canada.
B000059GEI|4.0|Some of the songs got on my nerves--- very repeating. But the classics are Marilyn and the Hot number, Lazy--- but Donald in the dancing with the fountain statues is great.

B008220DIC|5.0|people will love it , hate it or getting bored soon.<br /> After watching two times I am absolutely convinced that I love it. For me it's the most complex and unusual Thomas-Paul-Anderson so far.  Phoenix and Hoffman are acting congenial. There should be a new Oscar categorie  \\"Best Couples\\".  This movie is not about Scientology , it's  an emotional reflection about power, megalomania and addiction.<br />Every single cut or shot , every single dialogue or word sits and is perfectly arranged. The technical quality of the blueray is stunning. The analog to digital transfer is just spectacular here  ( Oppo BDP93 to Panasonic Z1)<br /><br />a true master!

B00BGIC2J2|3.0|The movie was funny - always easy to find humor in the things we deal with every day. BUT - the language is absolutely terrible. I will never understand the need for such frequent and repetitive use of so much profanity. The script was no funnier because of the foul language. As a matter of fact, I would have found it much funnier without it. Of course there are some sexual situations and nudity as well, but you expect that from the creators of &#34;Knocked Up.&#34; If severe profanity doesn't bother you, this is the movie for you. If it does, wait for the TV version or pass and watch something with a PG-13 rating.
B00BSBXZDY|5.0|From my 4 year old daughter to my 8 year old, 9 year old, and my 30+ year old self we all gave it 2 thumbs up! That's 8 thumbs!!!
B009H442DG|5.0|Apologies for the late review. When I pre-ordered this CD...I knew this would be good. After listening to it...it put me in a good Holiday Season mood. If you enjoy duet albums ...this is one of the best. There were critics who said that this album was sappy. Sorry to say that these critics are too young to ever have a memory. What can be mentioned of this reunion of John Travolta & Olivia Newton-John...golden. They have not lost their harmony. Sure, all musical acts have a Christmas Album. If one has a choice between Glee and this album....the choice is this album in your holiday collection. This Christmas Album Rocks, Jams, and Do-Wops better then Glee. The cameo performers also make this reunion special for Holiday Music listening. Olivia is still a Diva, John is still the Cool Crooner. It's a Cool Yule that will Grease Up the Mistletoe every Christmas.

B00AS1Q8FW|3.0|I was completely underwhelmed by the B- feel of the Jack Reacher Movie. I've read all of Lee Child's Reacher books and generally enjoy them very much. This movie felt like a low-budget Mission Impossible, and I in no way felt that the character on the screen was the same one as in the books. Also, there was very little chemistry between the Cruise and his female co-star. Speaking of stars, other than Robert Duvall (who I loved), why was the movie staffed by people who no one knew? What happened to the budget for this movie? I took my wife to it and had to apologize as we came out. That's not a good sign.
B008ASGP3U|4.0|Still reading it and liking it very much. He's a smart clever writer and I like the challenge of trying to figure out &#34;who done it.&#34;

B009VMN3RA|5.0|Sachi Parker's memoir is funny, poignant, honest, interesting, cultural, insightful, and well written. I don't care why she wrote it -- that's her business -- but I certainly liked reading it. Parker depicts a troubled mother-daughter relationship in a very believable way. Maclaine was always on, even when the curtain went down: she made sure to appear sacrificial and loving while insidiously sabotaging her only child. When Maclaine sent -- ahem, dismissed -- the two-year-old Sachi to live in Japan with her father, it was self-servingly cast in martyred terms in her own memoirs. Her mothering sounds worthy of an Academy Award winning performance.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Lincoln is magnificent film-making! This was the best movie last year and should have won the Oscar (with Life of Pi in second place.) You literally feel like you are a fly on the wall in the White House during the end of the Civil War. I mean, you are there! At several points, the camera seems to approach Lincoln and look right over his shoulder from the back.  This was both chilling and intimate as it reminded me of what John Wilkes Booth's view of Lincoln at Ford's Theatre entering the President's box must have been like on that fateful night. The supporting performances were wonderful but this film belongs to Daniel Day Lewis and to the Ages!  He doesn't portray Lincoln. He is Lincoln.  Speilberg's directing is flawless.  And the message (that politicians need to compromise or nothing will ever get done) is brilliant and certainly applies today.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I'm a newcomer as a Jane Austen fan...Started with Sense & sensibility with Emma Thompson a few years back and that was it. I bought this film on a whim and I'm either in great need of romance in my life or there's nothing interesting on TV cause, since I bought this movie, I think I must have watched it every night eversince, it's pathetic or not !!! I can't help myself cause I think it's such a beautiful story and I wish I could snatch a Mr Darcy of my own !!! I think these two center caracters have a certain \\"je ne sais quoi\\", an undercurrent, a chemistry that keeps me hooked...The proposal(or insulting !!!) in the outdoor monument of somekind, in the pourring rain(which says a lot of Darcy's bewichement), is incredibly electric, they're both very passionate in their debate and I think on the verge of maybe kissing but pride and prejudice keeps them from giving in into their passion about each other....My other favorite scene is the dance at the formal ball, Lizie consented to dance with Darcy against her better jugement but manages to torment and tease poor and sooooo formal Darcy...You could feel unercurrent's going on right then, already...Isn't the scene where Lizie, on a trip with her Ant & Uncle stands on the verge of the precipice beautiful ??? I think this version(Unfortunatly, haven't yet seen the version with Firth) shows such  beautifull scenary, make's me want to definitively to go to England before I die !!!), and the music is heavenly...I fell in love with ALL the caracters, especially the Bennet family which reminds me a bit of my own, nutty and funny and loving !!! And Mr Darcy, under all that frigid exterior has an most ardent core, dont you think...Well, for me this is a beautifull movie and I can hardly think to find such \\"amiable\\" qualities in the version with Mr Collin Firth(no malice intended), but I LOVE the pairing of Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen and their's is magical, funny, corky, I would say smocky but in that century passion wasn't a thing to show(some, tough, were outside the mold like Lizie was I think and Keira portrays that very convincevly).wasn't a thing to show(some, tough, were outside the mold like Lizie was I think and Keira portrays that very convincevly).
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|I had been hoping for a movie musical version of Les Miserables since I first heard the original Broadway soundtrack soon after it hit the stage.  I have also had the opportunity to see it on stage three times, and I was moved each time.  I was afraid that I was going to be disappointed in the movie that I had been anticipating for so long.<br /><br />I am happy to say that I thought the movie was very good over-all.  Hugh Jackman was great as Jean Valjean. He developed a character that was powerful and real and kept it throughout the whole movie.<br /><br />The three actors I was most impressed with were Anne Hathaway, Eddie Redmayne, and Samantha Barks. All three gave such raw and powerful performances that I was in tears at least once during each of their songs. \\"I Dreamed a Dream,\\" \\"On My Own,\\" and \\"Empty Chairs...\\" are fantastic.<br /><br />The first time I saw the movie, I was not as impressed with Russel Crowe as Javert as I hoped, but after watching it a second time, I focused more on the acting than the singing.  Crowe has a nice voice, but I think there might have been other actors with more powerful voices to fill that role (Brian Stokes Mitchell comes to mind.)  However, Crowe does an excellent job in portraying a man who is more and more conflicted about his beliefs as the movie progressed.<br /><br />I was also a bit disappointed in Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter as the Thenardiers.  Maybe it was because I have seen stage versions where these characters were so vocally powerful that the less powerful voices of these two actors seemed anti-climatic.  I also thought that Carter's performance was a bit too close to her performance in Sweeney Todd. However, they both were able to show the comedic elements of the characters.<br /><br />Finally, I was blown away by the cinematography. Director Tom Hooper and Production designer Eve Stewart created a world which was breathtakingly real.  I thought the opening and closing sequences were especiallypowerful.<br /><br />Just a note: I showed the movie to my high school drama class.  A number of the students are not big musical theatre fans, and a few are not theatre fans, but were put in the class anyway.  It took three days to finish the movie, and each time I had to stop it, there were complaints from the class.  I could tell that they were not just watching it, but watching it with interest.  Two boys actually liked the beginning so much that they went out and bought the DVD so they could watch it at home.  To me, that is the best \\"review\\" of them all.
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|The different take on a zombie movie that was in Paranorman kept this movie very fresh and interesting! The characters were great and at times laugh out loud funny! The fact that this was all made using stop animation just makes it that much more amazing! Looking forward to Laika's next film.

B00AZKCU7G|5.0|Steven Spielberg outdoes himself with his new classic about Abraham Lincoln and one of the biggest and most important moments done by him in all of U.S. history. It is an unbelievable due to its fantastic cast and well acting. It is slow-paced throughout the film quite often, but a lot of it is unnoticeable. However, due to the times you do see them, it can ruin a bit of the scenes for you.<br /><br />- I'd give it a 4.5/5
B009X01C64|5.0|Awesome stand/case for the kindle, made watching movies, browsing, and reading very easy.  Most importantly it protects your Kindle, and keeps it clean.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|I did not even order this book, I was just browsing all the books and next thing I knew I had two Oxford dictionaries.  I am not happy about this as now I have gotten my limit of books for the month and nothing to read now.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Great story and devilishly well-written.  Usually I am not a fan of gratuitous flashbacks.  However, this book maintained a great pace and kept me turning pages (with generous doses of foreshadowing).  Were it permitted, I would give it 6 stars.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|Another book that I did not order. It was just there after browsing. I'm not a happy kindle owner. Now I need to go without any reading material for the rest of the month, hit my limit over two lousy dictionaries...
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I stumbled upon this show and can not stop watching!  Great characters and the actors are fabulous!  Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys British Television!

B0075MFS9Y|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy this album.  I really liked that I was able to immediately download a digital copy of it.  Everything about the purchase was excellent.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Thank-you
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|One of the very best books of this genre. Seamless, endearing, captivating and exciting. I loved reading it but didn't like it that I had so much emotion to deal with while trying to read.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Thank-you
0525478817|2.0|This will be a bit hard to explain without spoilers, but I'll do my best.<br />Maybe I was expecting too much from this book, with all the 4-5 star reviews and comments from everyone, but I did not like it. At first I must admit I was really hooked, but torwards the middle and end of the book, there are story lines that I think should have been explored deeper, or at least make them more significant. Even when Hazel has an important revelation by the dutch writer, her reaction was what...maybe a paragraph? I feel like the author didn't deliver. And it's not that the book is mainly for teens and I'm 26, because I still cry every time I read Bridge to Terabithia, the book simply caused no emotions in me, and it's a real shame becaue the characters are likeable, but all the details and events of the book are vaguely portrayed.Some chapters start with random information the author uses to make a point, that turns out really isn't that important (Maslow hierarchy...really?)  I think teenagers are perfectly capable of exploring deeper, darker emotions and situations in a book, and if the Fault In Our Stars had done this, it would have been truely amazing.
B009O2XY12|5.0|Thank-you
B00BESM14U|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. There was a review and it had a list of movies everyone should see. This was one of them. I am glad. It wasn't a typical, flaky teen movie. There was great characters, great acting, a great movie for an &#34;outcast&#34; to see. Everyone fits somewhere. It just can take awhile to find your place.
B00BN2NY48|5.0|Not Like Being At The \\"O\\" In Vegas But Close. Loved It Had To Buy It To Watch It again
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|That is what I was prepared for but was pleasantly surprised. It was deep and meaningful and seriously though out. I was happy how it was not at all as &#34;sexually based&#34; as it thought it would be. The best part was the ending. People have so many different ways of looking at things. I watched with another person and at the end she cried and I smiled. I thought it was a happy ending, she saw it differently. That's what made it a must-see.
B006X5L6VS|3.0|Fun to play with. Once you start finding items in the sky abyone around you wants to take part. Camp fires have a new feature to them!
B00BLGXL3U|4.0|I had heard it was not based on Scientology but everyone I spoke to did not believe it. I finally had to watch it to make certain and am glad I did. I did not want it to be about that. I found it very interesting and profound. Not predictable and something that would draw me in and make me want to watch more. I am tired of all the stereotypical movies. Thank you.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|5 star game!!!!!!!! I Love this game it's awesome my favorite character is Frizzy and the best location is Rome. This game is almost like temple run just way more fun!!!
0684824906|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin was right on target. I especially liked the development of the characters from their early childhood until their demise. This book is chock full of History but it reads with the ease of a novel. The ten years that the author spent to complie and write the story produced a  true masterpiece.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book really grabs your heart. Loved it and wished it didn't have to end. It was truly a great love story
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great show that I have enjoyed watching.  Is really easy to view on amazon instant view.  It has been fun getting to know the characters
B0017XD3OY|2.0|I was disappointed that only the alternate ending played on the rental version.  I would have preferred the original, and nowhere was it displayed that only the alternate version would play.  I would not have purchased it.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This game is great and is a great implementation of mobile touch screen controls. The visuals and audio are really well done, and the different gameplay scenarios will keep you entertained for quite a while.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved it, I wanted more. Do they rebuild the store, have children of their own?<br />Write a sequel to this novel.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Well-written, well-acted. Julianna Margulies is terrific and Christopher Noth does his usual usual good job. I would recommend it to all.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Dunno what I'd do without this headset... Well, I wouldn't be pouring me cereal while listening to lectures on a different floor at the very least.Great sound quality, interesting drivers/program. Very sturdily build, and really well made all in all. Fantastic product for gamers, but great for just music quality too!
B0097C8XL0|1.0|Well like I recommend it to 10 and under. But it gets old fast if you are older. So I will play it if I am really really bored.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|well I think that it is an ok game but It gets boring when you run out coins and I think their should be more things to do other than putting coins in that little slot!
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I didn't finish because of personal reasons. I would like to read it again in the fall. I think the grandkids would enjoy it.
B00AHTYGRW|4.0|I was only 10 when it happened but it had a profound affect on me.  I found this movie to be an interesting portrayal of one of the critical moments in this story that still impacts American foreign policy today.  And it was entertaining to boot.  Definitely deserved the Oscar nods.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Oxford Dictionary of English-language . I used this to  check root words food lesson plans .I looked up definitions for classroom. I looked 15th century words.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Awesome game! More twists and turns. Better graphics and much better than Temple Run! Enjoyed it thoroughly! Want to buy full version of Brave, soon!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I saw the movie at the cinema totally worth it. It is so cute and video fans from the 70s to the 1990's will get the jokes. Many of the adult jokes will go over the kids heads. The animation is amazing, the storyline is thrilling, fun, and Ralph loves his mama.<br /><br /> \\"Wreck-It\\" Ralph(John C. Riley) lives in a video game, but is sick of being the villain in his video. In his video game, he destroys a hotel and \\"Fix-it\\" Felix(Jack McBrayer) repairs it. After working hours, Felix has all the friends in the hotel and Ralph lives in a garbage dump with bricks. He goes to meetings with other video game antagonists in the big electronic outlet plug. One day, he hears about a medal he can win in an action game to repair his reputation. After 3 decades of being the \\"bad guy\\" he can finally be get admiration and recognition from his peers.<br /><br /> He game jumps, and then Felix has to go find him. But he makes friends with his commanding officer, Sergeant Calhoun(Jane Lynch/P.E. teacher from \\"Glee\\"), and her and Felix decide to stop bugs from ruining the other video games in the arcade. Then he game jumps into a racer game, where he meets Vanellope von Schweetz(Sarah Silverman). Who's game has been over-taking by King Candy. Him and Felix choose to help her, and the ending is very happy and amazing. Worth the ticket and worth seeing. I won't tell the ending, but it is one of the better and thankfully a movie you can see with children.
B007REV4YI|5.0|....and excitement to the core. It paves the way for the BOND to come in NEW assignments under NEW &#34;M&#34;.<br /><br />Fantastic visuals, stunning action sequences and subtle yet a bold and touchy climax!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun when you have nothing else to do and when you travel a lot. I have a good time with this game it helps a lot when u need some thing to do so you don't watch the roads and get sick.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I use the weather channel on my desktop, and this is the same information only in a Andriod app. All the same features; put in your address, and get all the various forecasts, daily, weekly, weekend, etc. Great reference app.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I was surprised how often I use a calculator on the Kindle Fire.  I like this one much better than the app on my phone.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I have all of the seasons so far and this is one of the best of British drama's. I cannot get enough of it.
B006C3Q6GG|5.0|I read Master and Commander straight through. And then Post Captain. And more and more- finally, I was waiting for each next novel to be published.<br />I speak as someone addicted to Horatio Hornblower in high school.<br />The best wooden ships and iron men fiction of all time. Addictive.
B007THA4FI|5.0|As a huge Harry Potter fan it was only natural that I would buy another Rowling's book.It was very well written and I did enjoy it.So different than the Potter books.
0375831002|5.0|I heard about this one on NPR and had to read it.  I'm so glad I did. I highly recommend it!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This now the second time I've read &#34;the Way of Kings&#34; and I enjoyed it as much this time as the first. REALLY looking forward to the next installment.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Having read all 5 books sequentially in less than 6 months,  I can honestly say that each book, including #5 is as good as the next, the story never waivers, the feeling of fear, dread and joy always fresh. Best ride ever, can't wait for the next and the next and the one after that and....
B0040I09RM|4.0|This is a Good show acting is a bit mediocre at times, but the story lines are good and keep you intrigued.
0399160450|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the read. Although the book is long, Clancy kept me invested from start to finish. I recommend this book to anyone that enjoys an adventure.

B000S57KVO|3.0|This is a highly subjective review which you should treat accordingly.  If you like Jazz, you'll probably like this CD.  Personally, I don't like most of the songs on the CD, but please view that as a reflection of my personal tastes in music rather than quality or anything of the sort.  You see, despite my mother's repeated assurances that I would one day embrace Jazz as the music for &#34;evolved&#34; :-) listeners, I have not yet reached the threshold where most Jazz is appealing to my ear. I bought this CD for its rendition of &#34;Sinnerman&#34; from the movie (if you remember the museum scene toward the end with all the men in overcoats and tophats, that's the song that was playing.)  Unfortunately for me, I've found that &#34;Sinnerman&#34; is pretty much the only song on the CD that I like.
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|I had to pick this up when I saw it! My god children loved thier last copy to death<br />This set has a disk for every room in the house: 3d, blue ray, DVD,& digital copy.<br />Watching this classic anywhere and everywhere is awesome

B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I bought 2 of the other shark games and the imagery on this game is better.  This games makes you feel as though you are in the water with the shark.  This game also allows you to move up too a bigger shark.
B002ITWSUQ|5.0|the movie talks about not judging on appearance in a non preachy way. Peter Dinklage is clever as a determined reporter. and Reese Witherspoon is a hoot as Penelope's friend. with some of the sweetest romantic moments, this is a movie you can watch whenever life is letting you down.

B00BCOGM78|5.0|More upbeat and rockin akin to Blast Tyrant or Rock Fury than there last to offerings, same producer- Machine as BT. Niel's lyric are as sardonic as ever, crunchier guitar tones from Tim. Good Stuff!

B0094BB4TW|1.0|full facebook version not available for kindle fire. on the tablet it would be better to be able to access the full, original version
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Scifi western. Who would ever guess that this would be the best scifi show EVER. Best stories, best ensemble cast, best writing. My regret is that I didn't discover it until after the show's cancellation. I would have watched this show forever!! This was only one season long but it still contained some of the best lines ever conceived! I would (& have) recommend this to everyone. Brown coats unite!
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|this game is great fun.  the graphics are cool, the rewards keep coming, and the bad guys are endless. I've been playing for days and there hasn't been a dull moment yet. I may even go back and try the first one!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is my favorite game. Now u need 2 add the other games by Wooga,they have other games that I love,so put the other games on here

1442444053|5.0|I am probably one of the very few plus-40 people today who have never read Watership Down. When a friend told me about his experience with this book (and suggested I read it because it had some elements similar to my own recently-released all ages fantasy), I followed his suggestion. Watership Down as most people who have read it will agree is an allegory that is very much relevant to today's global society and our constant struggle for dominance. The uncommon characters (rabbits both domestic and wild) are more than rabbits. While each individual introduced in the story behaves pretty much the way &#34;real&#34; rabbits do in nature, they are also shown to have reasoning and planning abilities comparable to humans flawed by the same inability to see the long-range impact of their actions. The rabbits in Watership Down as characters in an allegory force the reader to take a good, long look at themselves and the effect of their actions on society as a whole. The book poses a very important question: What is the value of constantly fighting with other people for land and resources when there is more than enough of each for everyone if we would all share and share equally? The answer is: None. Wars only destroy; even the winner pays a huge price in terms of loss of life and loss of innocence.  Watership Down is one book I will be re-reading and re-reading for some time in the future. (P.S. The illustrations are a story in themselves - excellent choice of subject and execution.)
B00BHU9BV6|4.0|I loved the way this was filmed, very creative and unique.  The story is always a bit depressing, but the movie, costumes, set and lighting were exceptional.  I loved the actors in this version.
B00136Q6DA|5.0|I have heard Sara on the radio a few times and have really enjoyed listening to her. I finally decided to buy this mp3 album and once  I listened to it, I realized that there are quite a few songs that I recognized that I didn't know it was her! Very pleasantly surprised overall!
B004GTKP3S|5.0|I really enjoyed it...I love British period dramas and this one was up to par.  I would watch it again
B0011Z51QG|1.0|Okay, this shows my age. I have this same music, on cassette! Needless to say, it is worn out and I needed to replace it. Since I  have been doing the majority of my music listening on my pc, I downloaded the mp3 version. BIG MISTAKE! The audio quality is horrible! It almost sounds as though it was recorded with a microphone from a turntable! I think I will by the cd instead and make my own mp3 of this cd.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved the story.  Couldn't put the book down.  The story is keeps your interest like more than any other book I have read this year.
B00136Q342|5.0|A great cd! A very good collection of songs. Audio quality is very good over all! It is very good to hear some of these songs again!
0452289963|5.0|Eckhart reminds me of a little Buddha man who goes togreat detail to explain how to be in oneness without experiencing the flesh.  He teaches us that God is total in every one of us and he points out how to recognize the ego right away. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn how to connect with Spirit and to learn how to adjust yourself into spaces that you want to be in, an not o put your self in a space where it is uncomfortable.
B00A88FLI0|5.0|Bought this for my nephew for Easter. Haven't given it to him yet but he has had his eye on this for months already. I know he is really looking forward to getting this and building it!
B003UESJF6|5.0|I first saw this movie with average expectations thinking it was just another kids movie. When I left the theater, I was very happy. MEGAMIND has a great original story! The idea in that the villain wants to be something more than being a bad guy and the hero who is tired of being a hero.<br /><br />When the movie came on TV recently, I saw it again and still makes me laugh.<br /><br />Great story, plenty of humor, fantastic voice overs, sound, and music.<br /><br />Funny thing is the DVD is hard to find in stores. Where I live Target and Bestbuy don't carry the DVD. Blu-Ray is available everywhere. But here on Amazon.com, I can purchase the DVD.<br /><br />This is a great movie for all ages!
B00138JB3U|5.0|Another great P!nk CD! Great audio quality, great selection of tracks, a different take on her music. I have enjoyed listening to this cd.
B000001FLI|5.0|I bought this album on a whim, and now I am a full fledged Roy Buchanan fan.  Blues and Country mix?  Who would have believed that was possible.
B0073RSVMC|5.0|I got this for my son's birthday since he is obsessed with dinosaurs. It is the same size and quality I was expecting and was $15 cheaper than buying it from the store! He loves it!
B0047A72E6|4.0|I guess I was expecting a more mellow album from a legend.  To many screaming guitars for my Blues tastes, though he can play.  Update:  Updated the album from 3 stars to 4 stars as one of the commenters stated that his sound is closer to Hendrix's.  This made it click for me.  Even though its not my style, the album is solid.
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|I love this movie, watched it a few times and will watch again, but was very disappointed with DVD picture quality. It's not crisp, and colors seem too be - what's the best term - overexposed, washed out. In photography such thing happens when aperture/exposure is set for darker object, than is actually photographed - too much light kills the fine details. I don't know what would do it to a movie.<br /><br />I have different DVD's, some are not very new - and they have much crispier picture. I made a few screen-shots - the size turned out to be normal for DVD (853x480). I don't know what's causing this.<br /><br />May be it's just my copy? :/<br /><br />Ultraviolet copy quality was poor too, pixilated, but I didn't expect it to be good - it's not a real digital copy, I bought this product for DVD.
B00821OX98|5.0|Just started watched this series and It's got me hooked. Survival of the human race along side family rescues, what more could be said.
B00BRUYQFC|4.0|This is one of the most solid albums in awhile. I can listen from the first track to the last track without skipping through half the songs.
0517223546|5.0|Fantastic book . Edward Rutherfurd is a great writer. I like him as much (or more) than Ken Follett. Hope he keeps writing.
B000I9WW72|4.0|I first saw this movie when I was maybe nine or ten and loved it. A fantastically simple plot with great characters. I was surprised to learn Peter Jackson was the director. I would basically advise anyone to watch this movie.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. It's totally awesome and I can follow my minister on line in church service. It's great.
0345803485|5.0|Enjoyable read. Obviously its very popular. I would suggest this to others. Got me sappy to read other romance novels
B000TEPIQS|5.0|Is there any bad music from Sia? Nope. The more you listen the more you want to listen. It's addicting.
B003MYYJD0|5.0|Great buy looks great already had lot of compliments Swiss movement gold plated could not find better price for watch like this.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|It was a little difficult finding the word I was looking for,but I found it eventually after a little whIle.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This cover is thin but protects well. It gives my Kindle Fire a very sleek look. It fits snugly and does not add any bulk to the devise. I purchased a more &#34;artsy&#34; looking cover when I first got the fire and it began to look worn very quickly. I truly believe I will not have that problem with this shell. I would recommend it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is really great. I can finally build my dream home and  get it . You should get the game now so you can see.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book is one of my favorites. If you love football, dancing with the stars, or a touching story, (all 3 in my case) you will love this book too. I highly recommend it!
B005DOKM9M|5.0|it's really nice easy to get devise in and out with ease. love the color. light weight and very sturdy
B000001ESJ|5.0|I had purchased this as a gift.  It arrived in a timely fashion and was in an excellent condition.  This CD has been played countless times since it's receipt.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|If you are looking for action, that's the movie for you. Some scenes are hard to believe, but the main actor's charm makes you forget those minor details.
B000001ESF|5.0|The CD arrived in a timely fashion and was in an excellent condition.  This was bought as a gift and was and has been appreciated every time it's been played and it has been played a lot.
B003F3NEBG|4.0|A nice &#34;period piece&#34; that is very well done.  It has an intelligent script, good acting and direction, great costumes, and beautiful sets and locations.  It really brings Jane Austen's story to life.
B008NW67E0|5.0|I watched the grammys this year and after hearing I Will Wait performed by Mumford & Sons and I was impressed.  I purchased the cd and love every song.  Some more than others, but every song is excellent.  Not very often do I purchase an cd and can't stop listening to it.  Love hearing the banjos and accordians in a folk rock band.
1616550414|5.0|This is required if you are a Zelda fan at all. It gives much more story and behind the scenes than I realized it would.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I LOVE Nicholas Sparks books. He never seems to disappoint. It's one of those books that I will read again later.
B009NPA3MS|4.0|Phillip is pure talent.  Very easy to listen to hopefully his career will skyrocket and we will get more from him
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Game is terrific!  Wish glu credits weren't so expensive.  It is very addictive and fun to play.  I like the kindle version much better.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|THis story is great can't wait for the next season.  Pure entertainment,  cast is great.  get more to watch.  Perfect
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Loved it. Lots of action but easy to follow. Quick read fir the length if the book. Very well done.
B001L83PLQ|4.0|I came away thinking that Ms. Adichie must have known someone who lived through the Nigeria/Biafran conflict. She was born after the war, so she couldn't have got it first hand. This is the beauty of the novel, she really creates characters that are very real and believable. I think her perspective is mostly balanced and lays bare the horror of war. Her prose is sometimes lyrical, but always smooth as silk. This book is a good read and will enlighten and entertain. I would suggest this to all who like good writing, an interesting story and a little history.
B005T87QCI|5.0|My son who is 7 loves this game....It's a little hard for young kids but lots of action and good graphics
B000K7VHQE|1.0|Iwaited 4 weeks for the arrival and had seen it in hmv  half of the price i paid and the worst thing ,it looked like a cheap copy, even the box it was in ,it would not play on my player, although it would play on my lap top.  what a disaster
B009DJB8I2|5.0|My package came in the mail perfectly and it was lightweight!<br />I listened to the music and it was completely worth the wait, and the money!<br />It came with 2 codes, a Dota 2 Invite which also allows Dota 2 Test, and a &#34;What's in the Portal 2 Soundtrack box?&#34; code.<br />As long as you buy a new one from a trusted seller, A.K.A. Amazon, then you will get those! comes with a fun mini-comic also with all the musics listed in correct order on the back, too!
B004WR125O|5.0|Ordered this item for my uncle who has a wifi receiver. He loves it. It works perfectly with his toy..lol
B0013UIUBC|2.0|The blurb lured me to watch this movie, but what a waste of time. The problems it presented had potential but they were all dealt very superficially. Aaron Eckhart singing the opera was the highlight of the entire movie.
0767827791|4.0|While it was good to see this movie again ( I saw it at the movies when I was young) the quality of the print wasn't the greatest. For a remastered version it wasn't that great.
B000683VI4|5.0|Best romantic movie of all time. No love story has ever come close to having this much chemistry and passion between 2 people. There are many stories that have come along and claim to be similar or even better but none of them come close. The main characters face their fair share of trials and tribulations but they still end up together. Life has a way of constantly trying to pull them a part but they manage to fight for their love. Over time their love will prove to stand the test of time.
B00005V9IL|5.0|One of my favourite movies. Love the visuals and the premise behind the movie. The actors performed well and an excellent story line.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|EXCELLENT book with a well thought out complex plot.<br />The author stays a step ahead of the reader, but  everything makes sense with the next step.
B0073PPKNM|1.0|I was a big fan of Melody Gardot and waited impatiently for her to release a new CD. The Absence is dreadful.  I can't stand to listen to it.  I have seen some live performances of songs from her first two albums on YouTube.  Melody has amazing talent and can really change up how she presents a song. I do not understand how or why the Absence was released. To me she could have done much better but could not have done much worse.<br /><br />I read that some people are complaining about the extended break in the music on the 11th track. I thought the silence was the best part of the CD.
B004H6G0TI|1.0|I played this game on the ipod touch a while ago and loved it.  I was excited to see that I could download it for my droid razr maxx.  Unfortunately, the touch screen control fails after playing for more than a minute or two.  In a game that requires quick movement at avoid the plane hitting the ground, a momentary lapse of control will get you killed.  It is unplayable
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I liked that Pat Peoples attained the silver lining he deserved and that I finished the book with a smile on my face.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|My BFF plays in a band, and when they toured last, the band leader picked this up from the local library as an audio book for their trip.  My BFF came home telling me more about why I need to read this book than about their tour, so I bought it for my kindle.  I had fun reading it, there was good humor all throughout.  I also really liked the way it ended.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I already had an app for the Bible but it did not read aloud.  I love this because I can listen and not stumble over the pronunciation of the difficult words and names.
1616550414|5.0|This product is absolutely stunning!  It is filled with gorgeous concept art from all of the Zelda titles, and the binding itself is as beautiful as it is secure.  The additional content was an unexpected surprise and furthered our enjoyment of the product.  Especially considering the reasonable price, any Zelda fan would be out of his/her mind to pass this deal up!
B004T5K3OK|5.0|Great smartphone application.  The ability to &#34;scan&#34; documents without the use of a printer is awesome, especially when traveling.  Yes, the quality depends on your phone's camera and your steady hand, but the convenience factor outweighs some of those cons.
B00846WWVM|3.0|It is not the best app it has a few glitches with the water hose and your little sprinkle is fire
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book was cute but very predictable. A very easy read which I enjoyed. Who wouldn't love a free book for your kindle?
B009X2CVXA|3.0|I had read the Secret Garden by Kate Morton and so decided to read another one of her books.  This book was quite disappointing and not nearly as good.  I skipped through most of it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Wonderful game &amp; you aren't spending real money for it like you would be at the fairs! It's also cool that you play for puzzle pieces which keeps the game going!
B009UX2YAC|1.0|This game is the exact same thing as temple run. The only difference is that in this game, the people look like mutants and you run in front of subways, which in real life, if you got hit by a subway/train there would be no body. It would be splattered all over the place. A train crushes a car like a car crushes a soda can,so Imagine what a train could do to a human. Terrible game.
B0094K1JPC|4.0|This was a cute story... Harrison Ford is good in his role as a grouchy old news anchor at the end of his career.We were entertained.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|The creators of American Horror Story have the most twisted minds but they have been able to depict it in a very constructive way. This show is amazing and will have you hooked. I would recommend this to anyone!
0739366408|1.0|I'd love to download this to my iPod. I read the book via Kindle and loved it and hear that the audio book is worth the hear but I bought a new Mac and oddly, it has no cd drive. Blegh.
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|Will not download to my kindle cloud despite may attempts.  First time I had this type of problem with any application.
B003JTHWJQ|4.0|The quality of writing and the wide range of arguments or points as to why God does not exist make for a fascinating read.  While I don't personally agree with him, in many ways, I found this to be an insightful read, and I'd recommend it to anyone interested in the atheist viewpoint.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|First of all...Thanks Dr. for writing that book. I have lost my lovely mother and your book made me feel lighter. Your way of writing is beautiful and sounds very true. That is the point. You for sure is a special kind of people. I have read more than 2000 books about the subject. Yours is top. Here in Brazil lived a kind person called Francisco Xavier. A gentle man. Medium. More than 400 books and thousands of people he helped. Without receiving money. A kind o very special man. Very rare. I am saying this for many things you have report about what you see agrees with the teachings of Xavier.<br />Thank you VERY MUCH....<br />Dante Ameni Jr<br />Brazil
B007IK44CK|4.0|good action movie, nice way to spend some leisure time; will watch more movies in the future; like that I can stop and return to where I left off
B00B89WXYS|5.0|Since I first bought Dreaming Out Loud I fell in love with OneRepublic. Ryan Tedder does an amazing job as songwriter, singer, and producer and every time I can get my hand on a song that he wrote/sang/covered I do. This album is NO exception. Absolutely amazing, it is a great reflection of their evolution as a band with the same traits we have all loved about all of their other albums/songs. I highly recommend this album to anyone who has ever enjoyed listening to a OneRepublic song!!!
B0028IDXDS|5.0|Great use for nap time. Gives my son something to hold onto as well as keeping it from rolling away. Still easy to clean and sanitize.
B00AE2IJIE|1.0|Previews showed all the good parts.  This movie was just boring and not very funny.  Could have been better written.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Read my feeds from here all the time. Easy to use. I would rank it up there with flipboard for my news reading on my Kindle Fire HD.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|for those of you out there like me who read all of these books when they were little, i am sure you will love this one.  i wouldn't say it was quite as good as the other three movies, but i am still anxiously waiting for the second half.
B008ZCWFEE|5.0|This app was recommended to me be 2 separate friends as a way to help my kids learn math in a new way. I haven't played it myself at this point, but I know that my kids fight over who gets to play it.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I LOVE THESE BOOKS. THEY HAVE ACTION, STRATEGY, AND SOME ROMANCE. PLUS YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO THUNK ABOUT STUFF IN THE BOOK FOR  IT TO BE GOOD. The thing I love about Rick Riordan is that he fits so many small components and makes a mesmerizing, modern, appropriate book. His latest series, The Hero's Of Olympus, is so epic I finished the series in a week from reading so much. I read The Kane Chronicles like, 7 TIMES because their soawsome. I am also currently reading The Lightning Thief out loud. GET THIS BOOK
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Just your basic app game.  It is fun and it helps to pass the time at doctors appts. and so forth.
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|This is my first time really playin an online battle game for awhile and when I do I don't get on it for a long time or just forget my password but when I saw this game at the store on my kindle, I was like I'll give it a try and right after I created an account I learned how to play the game fast with easy steps and battling with other players. I recommend this to people who like to battle online with other players.
B001LA3LYU|5.0|The maestro at his best backed by an excellent band.  Good selection of songs from his classic albums and a few new ones.
B007A2O3FO|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie, I think people will like it. I like how the character moves through time. A must see.
B000FA675C|4.0|I see why the book was controversial back in the day.  I guess controversy sells.  The book was a nice distracting read on the commuter train.
0374275637|4.0|This book was a lot more technical than I anticipated. The author is an Israeli economist with a good deal of the sociologist in him. He is also a very good humanitarian, it seemed to me. There is a lot of academic jargon from the fields of economics, sociology, and psychology and that made things a little dry at times. The author is reporting results of research experiments and some of the contents seem to come from academic papers written for journals in those fields. So I found it slow going at times.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I came away from the book having learned some interesting things about the fallacies in our perspectives, in the ways in which we think and see, and with respect for the kind humanitarian who presents and explains them to us in this book.
1616550414|5.0|An amazing book! High quality materials. The history of most incredible game produced by Shijeru Miamoto! The Legend of Zelda!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This show is hands down the best show on tv right now.  I'm a fan of the books, and I think they have successfully brought the books to life.
B0060D0OKW|5.0|Alice In Wonderland is one of my all time favorites that Disney has covered ;-) Definitely worth a watch ;-)
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Excellent. Use it nightly, very simple and easy to use. Soothing, love the clock features too. Has a lot of different settings with very good sound quality noises that can take you to dreamland in several different vehicles. Bravo!
B000JQU1VS|4.0|This set of short stories is full of interesting puzzles that seem impossible until seen from a different perspective. I quite enjoyed them.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|After 12 albums, untold millions of fans and album sales, and a legacy firmly cemented in the annals of electronic rock, Depeche Mode could've have called it day.  Yet here they are, 33 years on since \\"Speak and Spell\\" with the release of their 13th studio album.  And by golly it's a good one.  So good, in fact, I daresay it's their most exciting record since \\"Violator.\\"  Not since the band reached it's zenith have they sounded this secure, confident and energetic.<br /><br />If you were a bit worried after \\"Heaven,\\" rest assured the rest of the album bears little, if any resemblance, to the first single.  As such, it strikes me a bit odd that it was the first single.  The follow up single, \\"Soothe My Soul,\\" is a much better representation.  \\"SMS\\" is classic Depeche.  It's hands-in-the-air electrorock that's gonna blow the roof of the place when the play it live.<br /><br />Familiar themes and images twist and snake through \\"Delta Machine's\\" 13 tracks - sin/redemption, love/lust, good/evil, etc.  Yet despite the familiarity, they've not grown stale.  Dave's vocals are as strong as ever as he moves from snarls to falsettos with relative ease, with Martin always in perfect harmony.  There were a few genuine surprise moments (\\"Alone,\\" \\"Should be Higher\\") that reminded just how underrated Dave's been throughout his career.<br /><br />Musically, \\"Delta Machine\\" is somewhere between the dark grooves of \\"Ultra\\" and vintage synth sounds of \\"Sounds of the Universe.\\" Ben Hillier, despite the protestations of many Depeche fans, came back for a third go around and he's done a fantastic job producing the album.  Flood, who produced \\"Violator\\" and \\"SoFaD,\\" is back to mix \\"Delta Machine,\\" which probably explains why it feels so classically Depeche.  Outside of \\"Heaven,\\" there's not a dull moment.  From the opening \\"Welcome to My World,\\" to the blues-infused \\"Goodbye,\\" \\"Delta Machine\\" is amazingly consistent and exciting.  My favorite tracks are the aforementioned \\"Welcome to My World,\\" \\"Angel,\\" 'Broken,\\" Should Be Higher,\\" \\"Soft Touch/Raw Nerve,\\" \\"Alone\\" and \\"Goodbye.\\"  The 2nd half of \\"Delta Machine\\" is a stone-cold classic.  If I had to choose a favorite, right now it'd be \\"Alone.\\"  It's an incredibly sexy song, dark and mysterious, with undulating synths, spooky atmospherics and a great vocal by Dave and Martin.<br /><br />Yes, I'm a bit of a fan boy.  They've been my favorite band since I was 15 years old and I'm now about to turn 40.  But even so, \\"Delta Machine\\" strikes me as such a fantastic record.  I've had it on repeat for a week straight (that hasn't happened since \\"SoFaD\\").  I can't recommend it enough.<br /><br />There's that line at the end of \\"Field of Dreams\\" where James Earl Jones' character says, in effect, \\"the one constant through the years has been baseball.\\"  For those of us of a certain age, the same could certainly be said of Depeche Mode.<br /><br />Here's hoping that never changes.rld,\\" \\"Angel,\\" 'Broken,\\" Should Be Higher,\\" \\"Soft Touch/Raw Nerve,\\" \\"Alone\\" and \\"Goodbye.\\"  The 2nd half of \\"Delta Machine\\" is a stone-cold classic.

B004DLPXAO|1.0|It won't even let me sign in to my account! Every time I try it just says that there is a network error. I've tried it in different places with wifi, always with the same result.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I like this game and play it everyday at home. It is nice to have it on my Kindle while I am out too :-)
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Very interesting series.  I would recommend it to anyone.  I can hardly wait for the third season to come out.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Cant wait for the next one! Got some extra features watching it through my xbox! Apparently not on the computer!
0425263916|4.0|I ordered this book because I was missing 50 Shades of Grey.  This is a more mature &#34;50&#34;.  It was an awesome read and I can't wait for the last book of the series to come out!!
B008602KQI|4.0|It was entertaining! Not as close to the book as I would have liked,but it got the story across.I would recommend to anyone that likes action movies.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Great ending. I was worried that it could mean the end of the world.  Peers proved himself as a true hero.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|nice movie to pass the time, it was good, just not great... you're not gonna be inspired or anything.<br />and now i am just filling in sapce to get the submit button. this is why i don't do reviews.
B00916TBZE|5.0|I couldn't wait for the US version of Olly Murs CD which should come out in April with Olly touring the US in support of it.  Olly is well known in England as the X Factor runner-up a few years back.  He is currently on tour.  Hopefully Americans will discover his talent.  Troublemaker (the song and video) have been getting some air play here.  This is a good album.  I like pretty.much all of the songs.
0525423656|4.0|Ten Likes/Dislikes:<br /><br />1. (+) Cassia, the Protagonist - Cassia is so much stronger and wiser in Crossed than in Matched.  You can really tell the difference and see how much her character has developed so far in the trilogy. There are several times when she wants to give up, but she doesn't, and what I found even better was that she knew her mind.  Though there still is that sort of love triangle, Crossed is very much a Ky book and the book where Cassia seems to choose the type of life she wants to have and is willing to fight for that until the end.<br /><br />2. (+) Alternating Points of View - Crossed didn't have much for it in terms of actual plot-- I can think of Matched and a few specific things that happened in it to advance the plot, but Crossed is much more of a character book, and it shows in the alternating points of view.  A lot of the most interesting things you learn about from Ky's perspective and he too sets the stage for suspicion about the Rising and what the third book will entail.  I loved reading about how he saw the world and what had happened to him--his journey, in many ways, was much more fascinating than Cassia's and his character development more thorough.  Fantastic decision on Ally Condie's part to give us both POVs.<br /><br />3. (+) The Poetry - Ally Condie's writing is also a lot like poetry, but what I really, really enjoyed about this book was again the incorporation of other poems into the book.  The poems from Matched become really important explanations for how Ky viewed Cassia and how the new characters view the two of them... and for the rebellion against the Society. I just love how Ally Condie makes every word count--that these poems, which had only seemed like words whispered between lovers in the first book, became so much more meaningful.<br /><br />4. (+) The World-building - Okay, first off, I love Ally Condie's capitalization - the Rising, the Carving, the Warming, the Outer Provinces... I love that she doesn'texplain some of these things like the Warming, that her capitalization basically tells you all you need to know about it.  Secondly, I was fascinated by the history of the Society and the story of the farmers and the Rising and the way Ky's parents factored in and the Archivists and the blue tablets and the Enemy vs. the Rising and ah!  All of it.  So many more details were added to the world already established in Matched and I can't wait to see how the third book will bring them all together.<br /><br />5. (+) The Romance - You guys know that I am not a fan of love triangles... but as I already said, this book feels very much like only a Ky book, so I'm disregarding the triangle and saying that wow, the love and romance is done so beautifully.  So, so sweet and agh, there really are no words to describe Ally Condie's writing and how wonderfully this was done.<br /><br />6. (+) New Side Characters - Four side characters are introduced who all have different stories to tell and who all are very interesting and integral to the plot.  I cannot wait to find out more about them and see the rest of their character arcs unfold.<br /><br />7. (--) Old Characters - Because this book takes place in the Outer Provinces / the Carving / outside the Society, you don't get to see some of the other characters introduced in Matched.  For one, Cassia's parents and brother Bram are not in this book (except in Cassia's thoughts)... and her friend... (I can't remember her name now? Emily, was it? Or??)  Cassia didn't think about her at all and she's not in Crossed either, and Xander makes only one appearance.  (Side note: though he is not physically there, he's in Cassia's and Ky's thoughts quite often, and he is perhaps more mysterious than I had ever guessed from Matched.)<br /><br />8. (+) The Setting - Ally Condie, on her website, has written about how Utah (I think) influenced the setting for Crossed, and I must say that I don't care what influenced it, only that I want to go wherever that is.  Even though the setting is treacherous and hard to survive in, it is beautiful, and as is typical of Ally Condie's writing, it seems to have a life of its own.<br /><br />9. (+/-) The Pacing - You can expect the same pacing that you get in Matched and the sense that things are slowly building to their end... but for someone like me, sometimes it does seem a tad too slow, even if I had expected it to be that way.<br /><br />10. (+) The Cover - You learn what the blue tablets do... and though I thought that this cover was beautiful and symbolic when I first saw it, I now think it's even better and more representative of the book.<br /><br />I loved Crossed just as much as I had loved Matched. Whatever Ally Condie writes, I will buy because one thing's for certain: she knows how to write and tell a beautiful story.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|If you don't already know who Imagine Dragons are, please check out their CD and their music.  They are incredible at their live shows too.  Their songs tend to have great lyrics backed by excellent musicianship.  Lead singer Dan Reynolds has a great voice and delivers on each and every song.  Imagine Dragons is destined to be one of the most popular bands in the world.  This album is one you should own
0312641893|4.0|Ten Likes/Dislikes<br /><br />1. (+) Cinder, the protagonist - snarky and strong but realistic. I loved that this book was more of a story of Cinder coming unto herself than anything else. It made me like her much more as a character too to see her struggling with what she is. Also, her strength is to be admired, because even though she goes through some incredibly tough situations, she doesn't break down. She also doesn't do anything immature even though she's clearly provoked by the stepmother. A teenage protagonist for the older crowd.<br /><br />2. (+) The World-Building - loved the world-building!  Lunars vs. Earthens and the Lunars's powers as well as their government and history, leutomosis and the research facilities, the ID chips, New Beijing and the market place, the emperor and the traditions, the way the Earthen government became the Union... I want to know more... particularly how the Lunars became so cruel.<br /><br />3. (+) The Romance - it was nice, and I liked that the Prince seemed to like her for she who is and her mechanic tendencies, and I enjoyed them having their little chats--the Prince talking a lot about what's going with the realm... but I think I would've liked more of an explanation. Cinder is \\"easy to talk to,\\" yes, but that's not unique enough for me. I want to hear more from Prince Kai. For one, it almost seemed unprofessional of him to be telling Cinder as much as he did. I get that he's not that old yet and hasn't really led anyone, but he surely should know that revealing that much isn't right. And secondly, of all the things to say about Cinder, he says \\"easy to talk to?\\" There must be thousands of girls who chase after him; I doubt that he can't find another one who's also easy to talk to.... But I really liked Kai as a romantic lead and since this is the first book and Meyer is setting up the romance for the next three books, I thought that she did a pretty decent job with it. It seems like it'll be slow-burning romance and happily it was not one based on love-at-first-sight or anything like that.<br /><br />4. (--) Character Stereotypes - I know it's a fairy tale and she's following it but she didn't need to make them so much like the stereotypes... the stepmother and stepsister really bothered me - they were clearly cut from the fairy tale, and honestly they didn't seem like real characters/people to me because of that.<br /><br />5. (--) Not Enough Reflection - There was a part of me that wondered why Cinder could still feel emotion. First off, it's the first cyborg book I've ever read... and secondly, when I saw how much machine invaded the human, I thought... well... why? Are there ever times when she can't feel emotion? She can't blush or cry and there are temperature controls and whatnot, but I wanted to know more. How does being a cyborg affect her? Is it really just the inconvenience and the second citizen-ness? (And something else which I won't spoil for you)... Other than that, Cinder's perfectly normal? No super strength or?<br /><br />6. (+) The Take on the Fairy Tale - That was a pretty funny take on Cinderella's ball and the lost slipper. I didn't completely see that one coming. Really loved the ball scene in general.<br /><br />7. (+) Predictability - In this case, I think the predictability worked for Cinder. It was obvious what the big reveal was going to be, but the tension of not knowing how that would fit in this new mold carried me through the novel. If you're someone, though, who gets annoyed with knowing what's going to happen, maybe this isn't the book for you then.<br /><br />8. (+) Pacing - Pretty fast-paced and enjoyable to read because of that. Book was split into four parts but each part was appropriately paced.<br /><br />9. (+) The Writing - Her writing is pretty seamless. It didn't strike me but it didn't pull me out of the story. Occasionally you hear from both Kai and Cinder, and though their voices didn't seem that different, it was nice getting to see the world from both their viewpoints (especially getting to read about the villain from Kai. The villain is top-notch, dangerous, and realistic because of how much she believes in what she's doing... Her minion, meh. But I suppose that's something to find out later.)<br /><br />10. (+) The Cover - Captures both the essence of Meyer's take on Cinderella and the original fairy tale.<br /><br />I really loved Marissa Meyer's world-building, and all in all, Cinder was a fun spin on a classic fairy tale. I'll likely keep my eye out for the sequel and recommend this book to all fairy tale lovers.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Nice &#34;twist&#34; at the end....I guess!  I really couldn't stop reading even in the middle of the nite...that's when I finally finished it!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This Series was on over the weekend. I had never seen the beginning. This is so much fun to watch episode after episode. I had viewed the movie more than a year past. Enjoyed the movie especially River. The bad guys outstanding. The crew is fun even with the various differences there is a strong bond. The Series cleared up how the crew was formed and the various adventures experienced. The Alliance WOW.

B00A3AYI50|4.0|From American Idol, I liked Phillip Phillips' voice and the spin he put on familiar songs.  His first album does not disappoint.  The only complaint I have is that many of the songs sound alike. I'd would enjoy a bit more different types of songs.

B00768D664|3.0|The book gives you an overall picture about stock investment in the US. The book may be suitable for someone who has decent experience with stock market. For anyone new to the stock market, I am afraid the book is not quite useful beside gaining some general knowledge about the stock market.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The relationship is unrealistic. Instead of weeks to gain a relationship they jumped into it head first without thought. The story develops too fast and is too predictable.

B000N6U0E2|5.0|Fictional or not, &#34;The Pursuit of 'Happyness' is one of those films that takes a look at the other side of single parenting and does a good job at it. I was particularly touched by the realness of what it is like to be 'homeless' and with a child in a big city but more important at the resolve to make things better by the Will Smith character. No struggle is without hardship.

B000S9HVZU|5.0|Despite the dark tone of death, and disillusionment presented throughout the story. Michael Cunningham crafted a clever depiction of the deteriorating lives, and relationships, of three women, uncannily connecting them to a single, tragic, ‘bright June day.’ Cunningham’s The Hours pays tribute to the triumphant hours that each of us sift out from the mundane, claustrophobic, and sometimes tragic other moments of human existence. The novel is a replete with figurative language, similies, metaphors, personification and symbols, coming together in associations, similar to a lyrical essay. The author’s brilliant mimicking of Woolf’s modernistic style in the use of internal monologue, stream of consciousness, original metaphors, and carefully chosen words, creates an almost poetic quality, and connects a pattern of similar images, of different women, at different times, each struggling with the dilemmas of middle-age; the novel come together as a metaphor of Woolf’s own tragic life.<br />Laura Brown, a housewife at on the cusp of middle age, pregnant with her second child, tries desperately to connect to her three year old son, and struggles with depression, disillusionment of living a stereotypical female life, and suicidal ideation, mirroring the demons that afflicted Woolf herself prior to her own suicide, in 1941. Clarissa Vaughn, dubbed Mrs. Dalloway (a character from a novel written by Woolf), by her ill-fated, bi-sexual, lover, Richard Brown, who not only is similar to the tragic character Septimus Smith, in the Woolf novel, but her story mirrors Woolf’s real life bohemian lifestyle where she had an open relationship with a man who had a separate gay lover, and where Woolf herself had a same sex relationship with Vita Sachville-West. Cunningham cleverly sets the tone of the story by weaving elements of the famous author’s own life, as tragic metaphors—of Mrs. Dalloway (Vaughn) and Mrs. Laura Brown, comparing them with Woolf’s own life in 1923, as she recovers from mental illness in the suburbs with her husband while writing her novel, Mrs. Dalloway, and planning a tragedy, that foreshadows, Richard Brown’s demise, in Clarissa’s story.<br />The clever use of language, and stream of consciousness similar to a modernist style, and the precise, vivid, descriptive language, that paints pictures into the mind of the reader, captures Woolf’s own unique style and enhances the melancholy tone of the novel. The author uses his character descriptions, not only to set the tone of the story, but to foreshadow its tragic ending, stating:<br />She straightens her shoulders as she stands at the corner of<br />Eighth Street and Fifth Avenue, waiting for the light… She<br />still has a certain sexiness; a certain bohemian, good-witch sort<br /> of charm; and yet this morning she makes a tragic sight, standing<br /> so straight in her big shirt and exotic shoes, resisting the pull of<br /> gravity, a female mammoth already up to its knees in the tar,<br />taking a rest between efforts, standing bulky and proud, almost<br />nonchalant, pretending to contemplate the tender grasses waiting<br /> on the far bank when it is beginning to know for certain that it will<br /> remain here, trapped and alone, after dark, when the jackals come<br />out.  (Cunningham, 13).<br /> Through Clarissa’s story, Cunningham cleverly crafts his theme into the first few pages of his novel, “she loves the world, for being rude and indestructible, and she knows other people must love it too … Why else do we struggle to go on living, no matter how compromised, no matter how harmed?” (Cunningham, 15).<br /> Like Woolf, Cunningham is able to develop original, fresh metaphors that capture an image, and compares her madness, and debilitating headaches to a “scintillating silver-white mass … like a jellyfish.” (Cunningham, 70). Cunningham use of a cake to represent ‘disappointment’ in Laura Brown’s story is Poignant, and reminiscent of the manner Woolf takes the mundane, in Mrs. Dalloway, and makes it remarkable. It compares the cake to her ‘life as a mother and housewife.’ Laura’s ability to bake a simple birthday cake for her husband transcends her success or failure as a wife and mother. “The cake will speak of bounty and delight the way a good house speaks of comfort and safety.” (Cunningham, 76).  When she begins the process, Laura is filled with anticipation of a great accomplishment, “she hopes to be as satisfied and as filled with anticipation as a writer putting down the first sentence, a builder beginning to draw the plans” (Cunningham, 77) but in the end, Laura Brown is disappointed, “[t]he cake is less than she’d hoped it would be.” The cake parallels the disillusionment she has for her life, “there’s nothing really wrong with it, but she’d imagined something more. She’d imagined it larger, more remarkable.” (Cunningham, 99).  Cunningham goes even further with his metaphor. He compares the disappointments in Virginia Woolf’s life, with the failure of Brown to make a remarkable cake. “Would she rather …have her cake sneered at? Of course not … she wants to be a competent mother … a wife who sets a perfect table. She does not want … to be the strange woman, the pathetic creature, … tolerated but not loved. Virginia Woolf put a stone into the coat of her pocket, walked into a river, and drowned.” (Cunningham, 101).  Further, the subtle reference to an unknown illness revealed in Brown’s story of her neighbor and (wanton lover) Kitty, is metaphoric when compared to Clarissa’s allusive love interest in her friend and former lover, Richard Brown, who is dying of aids.  Additionally, Cunningham places subtle references to the influence of the sexual abuse that plagued Woolf throughout her life, into the stories of these different women, as well as her homoerotic nature.  Brown, kisses her child and feels something more than motherly love stirring, Clarissa’s kiss of her daughter Julia, and Woolf’s strange kiss with her sister Vanessa, stir restlessly below the surface, like the “innocent kiss” in the kitchen that “feels like the most delicious and forbidden of pleasures.” (Cunningham, 154).<br /> Cunningham also sets up a metaphor where Brown’s suicidal ideation, as she rents a room to read a novel (ironically by Woolf) and is directly compared with Woolf’s own ideations, “She could decide to die… She imagines Virginia Woolf, virginal, unbalanced, defeated by the impossible demands of life and art, she imagines her stepping into a river with a stone in her pocket. …it would be as simple [] [] as checking into a hotel.” (Cunningham, 152). Through it all, Cunningham manages to eke out a positive, message from a dark theme of death, disintegrating relationships and disillusionment, by comparing the hours of ‘brightness’ in each story, Brown’s joy in her son’s tender moments of love and endearment, Clarissa’s romanticism, and love of nature, and of flowers—set in a natural way, compare with Woolf’s sudden realization that life hold’s precious moments that make all of the other dismal hours seem worthwhile, “there is this hour, now, in the kitchen” with her sister Vanessa, drinking tea, “[h]ow could she bear to leave all this?” And the forbidden pleasures of a “Kiss.” (Cunningham, 154).<br /> Like a lyrical essay, with its poetic language streaming in the reader’s imagination, Cunningham ties his story together with delicate associations, and subtle metaphorical images that mesmerize, and leave a reader with a better understanding of modern literature; so immutable, touching, squeezing, and stimulating the soul of each of us with a unique, ascent of the manner Woolf takes the mundane, in Mrs. Dalloway, and makes it remarkable. It compares the cake to her ‘life as a mother and housewife.’ Laura’s ability to bake a simple birthday cake for her husband transcends her success or failure as a wife and mother. “The cake will speak of bounty and delight the way a good house speaks of comfort and safety.” (Cunningham, 76).

0385333846|5.0|Slaughterhouse Five, by Kurt Vonnegut is a classic of American Letters.  It is a semi-autobiographical work that is also a scathing social critique of American and British Militarism, and the story is told through three separate ways.<br /><br />The central character of the story is Billy Pilgrim, a Chaplain's Aide who is captured by the Germans during the Battle of the Bulge after which he is taken to Dresden where he witnesses the firebombing of the city.  This is one third of the story.<br /><br />The second, third of the story is also told through Billy Pilgrim's middle years.  In the late 1960's Billy lives a prosperious middle class life working as an optometrist.  However, he is troubled by his war experiences, occasionally getting drunk alone.  During these binges, his breath smells like \\"Mustard Gas and Roses\\" and he occasionally drunk-dials war buddies.  On the night of his daughter's wedding, Billy is captured by aliens who house him in a zoo with a porn star, Montana Wildhack-this arc is the final, extremely important third.<br /><br />The aliens, Tralfamadorians from the planet Tralfamadore live under a different interpretation of time.  Instead of viewing the passing of time through the present moment, where the future can be changed by present actions, they view the life of a person as something more like a mountain range.  The mountain range is pre-established, and the person living on this mountain-range/timeline can move from one moment to the next in the same way a hiker can move from one peak or valley to the next.  There is no way to alter the range/timeline and the circumstances of each moment happens as it is fated to be.<br /><br />The three stories move together each one expressing Vonnegut's outrage at the firebombing of Dresden.  Indeed the altered view of time makes the outrage so much more intense.  The reader senses that something terrible will happen, but there is nothing that one can do about it.  The firebombing is forever enclosed in the amber of history-it cannot be changed.<br /><br />Through the book, Vonnegut explores moral and religious beliefs from the \\"Man-from-Mars\\" (or Tralfamadore!) point of view.  Is the lesson of Christ on the cross one of redemption for mankind or \\"don't lynch the wrong man?\\"  Is the American Economic system really just or do American's hate their own poor?  Most importantly, is bombing one's enemy really right?  Is there really such thing as a \\"Just War?\\"<br /><br />Published at the height of the Vietnam War, the book was an explosive critique of contemporary American Military policy.  It's theme however, is beyond timeless.  It explores PTSD, flashbacks, morality, fate vs. free-will and other metaphysical issues head on.  Truly the best book about warfare ever written.n the amber of history-it cannot be changed.<br /><br />Through the book, Vonnegut explores moral and religious beliefs from the \\"Man-from-Mars\\" (or Tralfamadore!) point of view.

0316228532|1.0|I think Rowling needs to stick to Harry Potter.<br />She seems to be trying to use her reputation for that series as an entree to \\"adult\\" fiction but fails.  This story isn't even realistic... she has dragged in every conceivable dysfuntion and perversion known to try to weave a story.  Leaves one wondering if she thinks there are no normal people or families in the world.  And why the constant use of the F bomb?  Does that constitute an \\"adult\\" novel? If it wasn't for her known name, this book wouldn't even get a glance from critics and many people would never bother with it.  I wish I hadn't... what a waste of time.  So unless you want to read about dysfunctional families, societal failures and people with physical and psychological issues for 500 pages suffused with repeated profanity, read something more worthwhile.
B005UBNL0A|4.0|My first budget gaming PC build to play SWTOR under $500 came out nice with this CPU.  Probably went a little overboard with quad-core for this game lol.  I don't overclock but the AMD Catalyst software overclocked to 4.4 Ghz with the stock heatsink.  Most posts I seen only had it up to 4.2 Ghz so thats not bad at all but 3.6 GHz is fine for what I'm doing.  The WEI was 7.2 or 7.3.  I did get at BSOD (Windows 7 Ultimate) while performing the overclocking test most likely from processor working OT (didn't bother to check the error code and it never came back).  First CPU had a squeaking noise and was easily replaced through Amazon (Thank you for the 30 day return).  Check the price for the 6-core since its better priced at the time of this comment.<br /><br />Some of the items you can get for cheapter if your really tight on a budget but I spent a little more on RAM and could of bought a cheapter disk drive or less of a vid card.<br /><br />AMD FX 4100 - $111.16 (with Tax)<br />G.SKILL SNIPER 1866 8GB - $57.99<br />Seagate 1TB - $79.99<br />GIGABYTE GA-970A ($10 Rebate) - $79.99<br />MSI R7770/OC 1GB ($30 Rebate) - $99.99 (Initial settings on SWTOR is set to High)<br />RAIDMAX RX 530SS 530 WATT POWER ($15 Rebate) - $31.99<br />COOLER MASTER Elite 431 ($20 Rebate) - $34.99<br /><br />Total=$496.10
B00AWQEKIK|5.0|\\"I want to play, I want to sing.  I want to make good records.\\"  Stephen Stills.<br /><br />Most everyone reading this knows Stills' music, so here's the bottom line.  If you're a deep fan of Stephen Still's music-his writing, his playing, and his expressive, time worn voice-you'll want this set.  Even the unheard different mixes of already released songs are worth hearing.  But I do wonder why so many were included, especially with all the unreleased studio and live tracks, both solo and with band members that have never seen the light of day.  Some may quibble about tracks included or left off (the lengthy version of \\"Bluebird\\" that Stills apparently dislikes is one example), but I suppose this is Nash's, Bernstein's and to some extent, Stills' ideas of what songs he wants in an overview of his music.  And Stills' writing does seem to take a slight dive beginning in the third disc, but as an overall statement this is a weighty collection.  It's evident (especially with headphones) that a lot of time was spent getting the sound just right-it's smooth and well balanced, clean and without any harshness.  All the music here-both familiar and perhaps not so familiar-is a testament to Stills' well spent half-century in music.  From just an acoustic guitar and vocal, to full electric band, Stills was (and is) always identifiable.<br /><br />From the very first track, \\"Travelin'\\" from 1962, his voice and approach to a song is already in place.  Even the 1964 song \\"High Flyin' Bird\\", with The Au Go Go Singers, shows his individual style.  From that point there's music from Buffalo Springfield, some of which are previously unreleased mixes that can stand on their own.  And some unreleased solo songs and demos (\\"Who Ran Away?\\", \\"49 Reasons\\"), into CSN tracks, an unreleased demo of a Manassas tune (\\"So Begins The Task\\"), and a good unreleased demo of \\"The Lee Shore\\" from CSN&Y.<br /><br />From that point it only gets better.  The songs you'd expect to be here are, but it's the unheard tracks that elevate this collection to something special.  The relatively short (2:39) \\"No Name Jam\\" between Stills and Jimi Hendrix is pretty cool.  Why hasn't the rest of that music been released?  I keep hearing (from Stills) that most of what was recorded is formless, aimless \\"junk\\".  Hmmm.  There's also the guitar dueling between Stills and Eric Clapton on \\"Go Back Home\\".  The tune \\"The Treasure\\", from the first Manassas album is here in an early 70's unreleased studio version with Fuzzy Samuels-bass, the great Conrad Isidore-drums, and Stills on piano/organ/guitar/vocal.  And speaking of Manassas (a personal favorite), \\"Song of Love\\" and \\"Jet Set (Sigh)\\" among others, are also here.  And listen to the well known \\"Change Partners\\" (with Jerry Garcia on pedal steel) in an unreleased but good mix.  Yet another gem is the live unreleased \\"Find The Cost Of Freedom\\" by CSN&Y from 1971.<br /><br />From 1973 there's \\"Little Miss Bright Eyes\\", an unreleased studio track featuring Joe Lala-percussion, Dallas Taylor-drums, and Stills-everything else, which is another good unheard studio gem showing Stills' skills as an all around musician.  And listen to \\"Now You Got To Run\\", an unheard live version from 1975, with Stills on vocals and banjo.  Or the live \\"Crossroads/You Can't Catch Me\\" from 1977.  But be aware-the edited version of Traffic's \\"Dear Mr. Fantasy\\", clocking in at just under six and a half minutes-is here instead of the longer version found on the CSN box set.<br /><br />The mono \\"Welfare Blues\\" from 1984 is Stills alone with electric guitar and vocals-yet another fine unreleased song.  The live unreleased version of Dylan's \\"Girl From The North Country\\" from CSN, in 2012, shows the trio still has that great sound.  The collection finishes up with a couple of live songs-one from CSN (\\"No Tears Left\\") and CSN&Y (\\"Ole Man Trouble\\") from 2002.  The final song, \\"Ain't It Always\\" is a great way to end things.  I may be quibbling a bit, but why wasn't anything from the 1968 album \\"Super Session\\" included?  Because it's on another label?  Too bad.<br /><br />As for the packaging, the hard back, wallet-style cover is slightly larger than a standard jewel case (5 3/4\\" across X 5 1/4\\" tall X 1 1/2 \\" thick), and has thick stiff front and back covers.  In between, the four discs  snap into connected, individual trays (with some great photos underneath) that unfold like the plastic card holders in wallets.  There's a slot for the 116 page booklet.  Included is a short piece by Graham Nash and Joel Bernstein.  A longer essay on Stills' career by Michael Garcia, and an in depth essay by Daniel Levitin.  The remainder of the booklet is track-by-track information, and a final essay on Stills by friend David Bender.  The booklet is also filled with a number of photographs (color and b&w), many new (especially the early shots) to most fans.  All in all, like the music, this is a nicely thought out package to present music of this caliber.<br /><br />So, if you're hesitating about purchasing this collection-do it-you'll be glad you did.  In the end every track shows Stills doing what he does best.  Worth the money.<br /><br />Stills fans should look for a blues album (\\"Can't Get Enough\\") in the near future featuring Stills and Kenny Wayne Shepherd.  Stills says it's smoking hot and he can hardly wait for people to hear it.ything from the 1968 album \\"Super Session\\" included?  Because it's on another label?

The night display is far better than most watches I've had. There is absolutely no drawbacks with this watch, and the thought that it will keep going like that...for ever is amazing. What am I going to find as excuses to buy more watches now?

B006LSZECO|3.0|Up until the last 75 pages, I thought the book was really great and even recommended it to people.  The plot line was so clever and intriguing.  From one second to the next you didn't know what the truth was and who did what. But it's obvious that the author couldn't figure out how to end it.  It was just preposterous.  Without giving away the story, I can only say she would have never gotten away with it because there were too many clues. I hate when things don't add up and that describes the ending to a tee.
B0060FXBNM|5.0|ITS LIKE GETTING 2 movies FREE! because u can pay that for just one flick!lol get this trilogy NOW.best action trilogy behind star wars orig flicks.awesome quality pic&sound too OMG crank ur sound system up!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|The only problem is that you have to go back to the start every time you crash. You can save your spot by using jewels, but I never seem to have any when I need them. That doesn't stop me from playing though, as this game is highly addictive!
B000FGGE7C|4.0|I am a sci-fi fan.<br />This film has a different take on vampires. Sometime in the future, vampires became a result of infectious disease. As a result drastic measures were taken to rid the world of this plague. I am not a fan of vampire movies, but I liked the unique storyline that vampires were a result of infectious disease. With so many recent unusual diseases on the planet recently, vampires as a result of infectious disease made the possibility of vampires a much more plausible storyline.<br />One of the things that I loved about this movie is that it was very futuristic and visually stunning. The only other film that is on a similar level visually is Avatar. The sets and colors in this film were amazing. The costumes designed for the star Mila Jovovich  were also part of what made this film so visually stunning.<br />I also love action film with strong female leads. Mila Jovovich delivers a strong performance and there are some great stunts in the film too.  I definitely would recommend this film to sci-fi fans.
B009G41CG2|2.0|I cannot change the look of the tiles so that I can feel comfortable playing this game. The background also cannot be changed.
B00AWQEKIK|5.0|Never a darling of the critics it seems to have been the fate of Stephen Stills to be unfavorably compared to Neil Young for most of his otherwise illustrious career. This compilation certainly helps to showcase that not only is Stills a world class guitarplayer with a distinctive sound/style but that he is also a prime songwriter.<br /><br />His 3 first solo records and the classic Manassas album just brims with great and often rather complex compositions with influences ranging from latin and country to classical music. And ofc his work with Buffalo Springfield and CSN(Y) spun out many sublime songs from his hand. In fact he was very much the leader of CSN(Y) in his heydays.<br /><br />Unfortunately the well went dry, his songs later becoming more formulatic and mainstream, the inspiration eluding him. And with so many others the prime reason being the rock star life, the drug use turning into abuse, alcohol taking their its toll too.<br /><br />Perhaps not a great poet he can certainly pull out some personal and intelligent lyrics. And always surrounded by superb musicians and even some famous guests like Jimi Hendrix, Jerry Garcia (\\"Change Partners\\") Herbie Hancock (\\"Spanish Suite\\"), Jimmy Page (\\"50/50\\", perhaps Stills' last really great tune).<br /><br />Graham Nash and Joel Bernstein has done a great work assembling this collection. Finding the gems from Stills' later days  and unearthing a host of unreleased tracks, mostly alternative versions of already known works, amongst them a fun \\"Lee Shore\\" with Stephen on the vocals.<br /><br />The true Stills fan do ofc have much of the material here already but will find enough stuff to make this interesting. The casual fan will find a treasure stove of great and essential music.

B00288KNLS|1.0|I love this movie.<br />But when I got the DVD the case was caved in. The DVD itself didn't look too bad, so I didn't return in. BIG MISTAKE. A couple of months after having bought it, I finally watched it... and it keeps skipping, is unwatchable.<br /><br />Lesson learned --&#62; make sure your DVDs are watchable within the return window<br /><br />And return badly shipped items no matter what
B0007ZIYM4|5.0|If you are a bit of a rock fan, you'll likely enjoy the small group approach used on this and prefer it to most other versions.<br />The large ensembles smooth out the very sonic detail most audiophiles buy an SACD for.
B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|A slow movie, good for time pass, nothing exiting in photography or special effects. The dragon gimmick was really lousy
B00BKEMX28|5.0|All I can say is, if you like Portishead, Massive Attack, Bjork, etc, this is definitely worth the buy. Its very unique in style, but keep in mind, its different from the popular NIN's material. It may be little slightly heavy for some, but its certainly not head banging stuff. A good approach to it would be to listen to it on some decent speakers or headphones and soak up the complex sound mixing.

B00571F26Y|2.0|The only really new ideas to me found in this book were that even whole wheat has a high glycemic index and that the genetics of wheat have changed so much in the last fifty years.  Otherwise I agree with the other low star reviewers that the final advice at the end of the book is to go low carb to lose weight.
B007Y5IAV0|4.0|This CD Surpassed my expectation by far, am always leary of buying a &#34;lead singer&#34; from a broken up band, soad. But it is great, my 14 year old daughter loves it too!
B003WUYOQ6|4.0|This, and his other book, Good Calories, Bad Calories, are well written, well researched and very entertaining (considering the topic).  This is all information we learned (if we were around then) in the 60's and 70's, and reading the book was a good reminder of what I knew then, and what worked for me then.  If you are looking for a different way to think about your weight and health, different than what is being preached today, that is, I highly recommend this book.  It could actually change your life.  Besides that, it's a fascinating look back at how we've come to be where we are today vis a vis obesity and the current incorrect explanation for how we got there.  What's astonishing is the scientific/nutrition/health community's tenacity in hanging on to ideas that don't work, even in the face of the mountains of flesh Americans have piled on in the last 30 years or so.  It will make you think about other (non health related) ways that we get attached to ideas, either for emotional reasons or because we're just too lazy to think for ourselves.
B0012GTZC0|3.0|Read winter of the world first. Mistake. Characters were not as capturing.  Always enjoy follett's  involvement in history.  Alsaws a good read
0061452068|5.0|Everyone --- EVERYONE (and I'm specifically thinking about those yahoos in Washington) should read this book.<br />Well written, totally engaging and plenty to think about (and yes, even to make you feel optimistic about humankind ... if not for the short term, certainly for the long term.).  As a side note, I bought the book AFTER listening to the Audible version (which is really well read) because I wanted it to refer to -- but the Audible version is really great.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|These batteries fit and worked perfectly.  The price of this 5 pack was a bit cheaper than the price of a 2 pack of another brand.  Now I have extra batteries on hand for the next time I need a replacement.
B0000C9ZBW|2.0|It looked and felt right - except that it was dead on arrival. The instructions were very small - small enough to appreciate the printing technique - but the package didn't come with a magnifying glass to read  them. Returned it promptly.
B006M9NJFG|4.0|This canteen holds an ample amount of water (1 L) for your hiking trip or to prepare a dehydrated camp meal.  The cup is a great addition and is very handy to boil water in if you find yourself in an emergency situation.  However, when boiling water, I noticed that the coating on the handles was damaged a little from the heat.  Nothing too significant, but if it was used often to boil water, it could be come an issue.  Thus four out of five stars.  Highly recommended.
B009ZQC7MY|1.0|The plot got way out of hand with an unnecessary degree of unpleasant subject matter, wayyyy too much tragic death and too much unrealistic focus on homosexuality. Not even enjoyable to watch any more.

B008X9Z37A|5.0|The case meets and exceeds my expectations.  It is durable and lightweight.  I would recommend this case to anyone who has a Kindle Fire.
B005LAIHR2|2.0|I love the 80's and was hoping for an experience with this film like that in 'Mama Mia,' which is fine silly feel-good bubblegum pop with a tissue-paper thin plot.  'Mama Mia' was mostly an excuse for enjoying ABBA again, because your hair's gray now and you don't care anymore that ABBA wasn't cool then and pretty much isn't cool now. I was disappointed in this film for a a number of reasons.  The young leads were fine and most enjoyable.  Catherine Zeta-Jones was tolerable as the moral-crusading former groupie of the mega popular rock star, Stacee Jaxx.  I always like Alec Baldwin and Paul Giamatti and they didn't disappoint as the club owner and the rock star's manager, respectively.  Stacee Jaxx was supposed to be, as I guess, a fusion of Axel Rose, David Lee Roth and Steve Tyler.  Tom Cruise did a fine job acting the part of the decadent decaying and brain-dead rocker.  His voice, however, wasn't there for the music.  To be fair, he sang remarkably well considering he doesn't do that for a living, and as far as I know hasn't ever done something like this.  It wasn't that the vocal delivery was bad.  The voice was just wasn't right.  He isn't a musician and being able to sing the notes doesn't make you one. He's also a highish tenor, which doesn't work with the music he was singing.  That's fine in Journey songs but not heavy metal anthems. The way I thought about his performance as Stacee Jaxx was similar to the way a lot of people who are serious musicians and singers felt about Anne Hathaway's perforance in Les Miserables: beautifully acted and sung with a lot of emotion, but didn't do justice to the music (if you really loved the music.)  Although it's not as common for rock singers to be given credit for having real musical chops, especially metal hair band rockers, the best ones really do have them and it's not an accident. Also the sight of almost-50-year-old Tom Cruise walking around very buffed out and shirtless pretty much the whole time was not as impressive at it might have been. At this point it's self-parodying in a way that I don't think it was meant to be, and made him look both dated and sad, when the emphasis was supposed to be on his being still viable as a hard-rocking sex god.  Trust me, the girls don't love Mick Jagger anymore because his looks are sexy (it's only because he's extremely rich.)  Axel Rose looks freakish since his facelift, David Lee Roth is old and balding.  Both are paunchy and plainly Past It.  Steve Tyler looks like a hairy pregnant pencil, with streaks of gray in his long thinning locks.  However, unlike the other two, he still 'has it.'  Pity Tom couldn't have emulated that quality, although I think that's what he was trying for.<br /><br />Put your shirt back on, Tom, and SHUT UP.

B00A6I87UQ|5.0|I bought this atlas after seeing it referenced in several articles and reviews.  As a manual Dobs telescope user, I depend on star-hopping.  The one-hand format of the atlas, and the easy navigation to the correct map, make it very useful when one is looking at the chart, then the eyepiece, then the chart, etc homing in on the faint fuzzy target.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This series took me a minute to get into.  But a few chapters into book 1 and I was hooked!  What a electrifying, imaginative series.  Someone asked if I thought they could continue the movies after seeing the first one, she thought there was nothing left to tell.  I said read the books - once she did she understood :)

B008JIFJ4W|5.0|This is a terrific collection of songs.  The blend of styles makes for an incredibly unique sound.  The chorus and hooks will stick in your head for weeks.  Bright shiny music about emotional and mental turmoil speaks to the common experience of a generation.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I down loaded this because it looked like a fun and more kid friendly alternative to some of the others that are out there.My kids like the game and so does my husband. I wish it wasn't about vandalizing and running from the cop though, that is kind of negative behavior that I don't really want to encourage.
B00BBW15R8|5.0|\\"Intouchables\\" is so real - if Hollywood had produced this story, there would have been several opportunities for excessive drama, even violence. However, one of the great things about this film is that it does not feel forced at all. It drew me straight in and kept me hooked the entire time (and not just because I had to be sure not to miss subtitles).<br /><br />I know other reviews have already mentioned these words, but I find myself listing the same simply because there's no other way to describe this film! Beautiful, touching, poignant, moving, unique, real, well-acted, well-written, and how cool is it that it's based on a true story?? Love it.<br /><br />If you, like me, tend to shy away from movies that appear to require a giant box of tissues, fear not! It's more of a sweet movie than sad.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I love this movie, I seen it million time on Demand, and so glad to have it for my collection.
B0045HCJRG|5.0|My parents love this film and it was nice to find it here since it has not been found in our local area.
B009AOFNU4|3.0|I play a lot of games. However, when it comes to gaming, my Samsung Galaxy S Blaze doesn't get a lot of use. I've been a console gamer since the NES and I guess the majority of games on the Android market lack a certain... let's say polish. In addition to the shortcomings of the games available, the size of my phone is anything but ample, making the touch controls a bit problematic. When the SteelSeries Free came across the Vine I thought it'd be a good opportunity to broaden my Android horizons. Unfortunately, a myriad of issues, none of which necessarily the fault of the manufacturer marred my experience. Even though SteelSeries doesn't have much to do with any of the problems I faced, I still have to review the product and either recommend or disuade you from spending your hard earned cash on this controller. The following is reviewing the controller as an Android device. I can't speak for iOS. In terms of PC gaming, I can't imagine anyone would use this over the plethora of PC game controllers including the wired and wireless versions of the 360 controller.<br /><br />Issue the first! (little Simpsons humor for ya) Google Play. I read an article by one of the Ticket to Ride creators about their mobile version of the game. There was a section that I found interesting about why it wasn't available on Android. He said that first and foremost the hardware was an issue. Each iOS device has a specific hardware configuration. It's easy to develop for specific versions of the iPhone or iPad because each iteration is fundamentally the same. Android devices run the gamut of hardware configurations so it's more difficult to develop for without alienating a large demographic by distributing a game that won't work for some, will work poorly for many and fine for the rest. The other concern he cited was that studies (who knows what studies or who they were funded by) showed that Android users are less likely to pay for apps than iOS users. Now, we could go on discussing average incomes, e-conomies and the like but what it boils down to is really the Android OS lacks the caliber of games that the iOS does. Without a large library of quality games, a gamepad's value is greatly diminished. Take into account the games that are built solely for touch controls and will not work with this gamepad (Dead Space Mobile) and then factor in that only CERTAIN games (found on SteelSeries Free's website) actually work with this gamepad and you may not get as much bang for your buck as you had hoped.<br /><br />Next: Android version. I think you'll find that a lot of the negative reviews stating that this product doesn't work can be attributed to outdated Android versions. The SteelSeries Free requires Android 3.01 or later to work with many games that don't have configurable controller options in their menus. The problem is my carrier isn't big on keeping up with the Android versions, especially if it's not on their latest models. Because of this I had to download software to my computer so I could manually upgrade my Android version which took far longer than it probably should have. I'm a software/computer savvy person and this was still annoying. Again, this further reinforces my point that it's not SteelSeries' fault, but I would assume that the majority of Android users aren't updating their OS every time something new comes out. Based on the reviews, it sounds like I'm right.<br /><br />Lastly, the price. Eighty bucks is pricey for a controller no matter what it's for. Eighty bucks is probably more than most of us paid for our phone and definitely more than we're used to spending on games. You would have to be a pretty hardcore mobile gamer to be able to justify this price but, ironically, most mobile gamers are casual. The fact that there's a not too lengthy list of compatible titles, the cost is even harder to swallow. At the end of the day this is a compact, plastic/rubber, bluetooth controller and nothing more.<br /><br />Honestly, it's not abad controller. It's very responsive. It feels comfortable even in my large hands. It's solid and doesn't feel cheap or low quality. It comes with a nice cloth carrying pouch to keep it safe during travel. The problem is its aspirations, at least within the Android side of the market, are too high. I can't speak for the iOS, but if I had to pay for this, I can't say there is even one game on the Play Store (and on the compatibility list) I would deem worthy of the lofty price tag. The game I was hoping to use it with, Dead Space, isn't compatible. I knew before receiving the controller and I think most will do their research first before picking it up, but I would find it hard to believe that any Android user would look at the list on the Free's website and say, \\"Yes, I need this controller!\\".bad controller.

1481130331|5.0|Though we journey through this work with fictional characters, it is evident early on that this piece is comprehensively researched - the thoroughness of detail in no way detracts from the story told through the different personalities the author has created and placed within such a turbulent time in history. I particularly enjoyed tracing after the protagonist Greta as she evolved (like the other cast members were forced to do so through their rapid changing lives) through her sweet, simple, early romance, then downward through the complex unveiling of the hate, intolerance, and abuse ramped during the Second World War, into painstakingly sacrificial, full-sprung womanhood.<br /><br />The author writes a clean-line prose that is comfortable to read and easily (within the first few sentences) exports the reader to another time and place, another level of desperation and despair - and most importantly reminds the reader of the utmost depths that hope can actually reach when faced with hardships such as the ones chronicled so historically poetic in The Luck of the Weissensteiners.

B00A11AN6O|3.0|I would give it more stars if it supported more versions of the Android os'. Too bad it only works with 4.0 & 4.1  Take care of that problem and I'll give it more stars. That's a real bummer.  :-(
B0094BB4TW|5.0|facebook is a easy way to communicate with friends and family. facebook also has a ton of games to play and interact with.
B009KEN87O|4.0|I have an older HTC Incredible 2 and this game really taxes its processor. Other than that it is pretty fun.  A good reboot of space invaders.
B005HSL626|5.0|it is a good family game to play.i would reccomend this game with friends with children. it is very entertaining.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|3 words. I.Loved.it! Such a great book can't wait to read the second. Well written and made me cry. One of my favs!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Everyone should read this story so true to life what obstacles some have to except in life and be excepted by everyone . The book of the year for Fairfield CT in 2013 was Wonder every school is reading it to the children from elementary and up it is a book of KINDNESS.
B00B6CUO6Q|5.0|I hadn't heard of the series until the fuss over the finale in season 3. I felt as if I were missing out on something many knew about so to catch up I bought the series and have become hooked.
B002UM5BXW|4.0|I love his writing, although I didn't understand a lot of the French & all since I'm on the outside looking in. A must read for fans, foodies & those with interests in becoming a chef. I can't wait to read & to see more adventures of Mr. Bourdain!
B00BI745AA|4.0|The singing is not up to what I have seen on the stage, but still a good production.  Broadway actors would have been better than the Hollywood actors.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this game is very fun...more fun than most of my other games. It looks realistic. I think I will like it for a long time.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I got this game when it first had a free 'taster' version.<br />I got totally hooked, and bought the full version when it was $4.99. I never pay $4.99 for a game, and I held off as long as I could, and ended up buying it. A week later, it was the FAOTD, but ...ho hum!<br />Its levels get frustratingly hard, I've been up till 3am before.... which means, in my books, it's a good game.... well worth the money!<br />It's not  just a kids' game......I'm in my 60's....and I love it.<br />Great graphics, and a great time-waster!
B0095VPBM2|5.0|Good performance and pretty decent integrated graphics.  Very satisfied and have no regrets choosing this over Intel, particularly with the increased graphics performance over Intel's integrated graphics.  Plus, if you add a discrete card later, it will still use the APU to help with some of the lifting, so it's a good long term investment too.
B0091REZMW|3.0|it doesn't replenish energy fast enough.  a lot of things require paying with diamonds and you don't get enough.  wish there were more opportunities to earn diamonds.
B00AXVIBKW|4.0|I thought this was a great album! The songs are in true punk rock form, short, sweet and to the point. To me, True North feels like a return to classic Bad Religion. Well done guys!!
B0063HC7EQ|5.0|I jumped in to this book with several flowing reviews from the outset. The first few chapters had me expecting the typical disappointment surrounding such scenarios, but Pirsig was quick to recover.<br /><br />The lead in to heavy intellectual consideration of pivotal concepts surrounding life, the universe and everything was gradual, but only enough to introduce the laymen to concepts they might otherwise be unexposed to.<br /><br />This book is definitely targeted at the critical thinker, and does well to make compelling arguments - some in favour of buddhist ideals, others in favour of science and human development. He eventually brings it all together by bridging the gap between art and science, compelling the reader to reconsider how far pure rational thought, or pure romantic experience can take someone in this world. He uses a variety of compelling tools to unify the commonly differential points of view and demonstrate how they will improve outcomes, quality of life and peace of mind.
B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|I've been a clutch fan for many years but I have to say this album exceeded my expectation. Every single song made me wish I was driving a hundred miles an hour to nowhere! This album is easily in my top three clutch albums of all time. Thank you Clutch  for another great piece of work!
B00BYOEMTQ|5.0|I love they had this version with the bonus features! This was the same cost as getting the version without bonus features
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Love this movie. Enough to actually buy it even, and that's saying something. Comes with DVD, Blu-Ray, and digital copy redeemable on Itunes, flixster, and even amazon instant video.
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|Quality was great, just wasn't the greatest movie, but the kids liked it well enough. I enjoy the ease of not having to drive to Redbox to return, even if it costs more.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is really awesome. I love to play their games the are fun and entertaining. Anyone who plays this will love it.
B000FC13Y0|3.0|This story is good, the movie was better. He doesn't tie things up very well and kinda glosses over a lot that happens
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved it i recommend it to every one i couldn't stop reading it best book i have ever read
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Great great story! I love how involved you get into the life of the character, and the ending made me really sad that I couldn't read the next one yet!!
B0011Z939M|5.0|Has been on constant rotation on my iPad. Can't get enough, it's entirely satisfying. Would recommend this to any rock fan.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a great game. you should definitely get it. it is a lot of fun and great pass time.
B001GXF2YY|5.0|Great mystery. Kept me guessing until the end. Love the Harry Bosch novels. Would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good mystery.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Loved this book! It constantly had me guessing at what would happen next. I recommend this book for everyone!=) great read!!
B0027MJU00|5.0|This one, like Gone Girl, was hard to put down.  Highly recommended!  I am looking forward to other works of Flynn's.
B000KIE11Q|2.0|I SENT IT BACK BECASUE THE FACE WAS TOO SMALL. WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED. NOT VERY STYLISH FOR THE PRICE.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved the title ...  and it's multi layer meaning. Young love, tragic circumstances, fate, true love, friendship .... it's all here. And the author made it all so seamless and believable. Loved reading and re-reading it.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|I would highly recommend this show. It is intriguing and filled with many twists that leave you waiting for the next episode. It is like no other show on TV.....one episode will get you hooked!
1400067820|3.0|The structural concepts introduced by the author are quite similar to Resiliency theory, common in industrial and aviation safety.<br /><br />The notion is that that systems are far too complex to understand and control all the variables, and complex systems are self forming.  Over regulation of the complex system ends up increasing rigidity and, when problems arise they do more damage.  Resiliency allows less rigidity and the ability to adjust and compensate when trouble arises.<br /><br />While the book is interesting and the language caters to a more 'economic' or 'financial' bent.....the concepts have been around in the systems studies and industrial safety (aviation, nuclear, etc) for a long time. Eric Hollnagel has written some great books on the topic of resiliency and systems safety.
B0033AX1YG|5.0|There is only one thing better than listening to the late, great Gary Moore...decorum prevents me from mentioning it here.  Moore is a true guitar axe master and he lives on in these recordings.  While there are some lows on this compilation, the highs more than compensate.  Listening to Gary do Texas Blues and pay homage to Stevie Ray and Billy Gibbons is true magic and his interplay w/ Albert Collins brings tears to my eyes.  If you don't know Gary Moore and you love the blues, I would simply ask 'Where the hell have you been?'
B005BY3XHC|4.0|Excellent book. I refer to it whenever I need to be reminded of the simple truths it espouses.In fact I'm about to pull it off the shelf again right now.
B009KEN87O|3.0|eh ok for the Kindel Fire. it helps me kill the time while I am traveling or waiting in the doctors officeeh ok for the Kindel Fire
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I sincerely suggest this game to  whomever is looking for a good game it is so good whomever wants it will love it you earn coins to buy stuff like another char. Never Ever think of this game as a lame game I may be 12 years of age but I have a very good game sense so good luck and good gaming!
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|I was looking for something quick and easy to use while I was traveling. This was not the application I needed.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|It starts in a sort of confusing way. Didn't know quite what I was getting into. The characters are complex. Each episode is shocking and unanticipated. The acting is wonderful.  I'm looking forward to the next season.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I loved this book! I have never read anything like this before and I have read hundreds of books. I couldn't put it down!
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|It was sometimes a little slow for adults, but the cultural references were fun. I especially liked the Oreos riff on the Wizard of Oz.
