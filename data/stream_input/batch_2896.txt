B00683T41E|3.0|This item came in a timely manner and the packaging was exceptional. My problem is that when I went to watch it, it said could not play in this region so I went back and looked it up but found no indication of a region stated for this item. I'm sure I could have sent it back but felt it would end up costing me more then the price I purchased for it. Enjoy
B00821OX98|3.0|I cannot really give a fair review because I have only watched two shows.  Looks like a okay sci-fi series.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Netflix and Google Streaming is just OK as the quality of content drops. Chrome Tab casting is just pathetic, not sure whether thorough testing was done before releasing the product.
B000OV85AW|5.0|Timeless. Incredible performance by Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman.<br />One of the all time top movies in the world of movie making.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I love action movie because it does not trash in it. It takes away the long day at work.  No talk just action
B006R1T40I|5.0|In this era of slapped together pre-packaged music...this cd is a ray of sunshine!  Earthy and delicious , these songs are thick with the traditional country/rock/bluesey sound that Bonnie is famous for. Even the old Gerry Rafferty tune \\"Right down the  Line\\". If your a fan,you MUST own this...if youre not familiar with Bonnie's work...you HAVE TO buy this!
B00E0MCYPS|1.0|Alright this game is terrible!!! It is supposed to be great but u have to turn your device upside down to turn!!! This is one of the worst games ever. No more to say.
B00E0MCYPS|5.0|Graphics are awesome. Gameplay is fluid no lag. It's rally racing so expect drifting. Steering is sensitive but not out of control, skip the tilt functionality and opt for onscreen buttons. Hardly any ppermissions. For FAOTD it's a great app.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|just fabulous.  can't wait for season 4. the scenery an costumes are gorgeous. the stories absorbing. the characters are just so real to me
B0024FA9IM|5.0|Do wish they would make a sequel to this show. Maybe even a new series! Ordered on a whim. Liked!
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|I did get to see it. I pushed play and it took me. to the page were I had to pay for the movie again
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|This album is just Genius. It reeks of originality and creativity. Its indescribable.<br /><br />Singles so far are not ones I would have chosen. Best songs are All Time Low & Satellite.<br /><br />You know that guy who always drives down your street blasting ear splitting guitars and vocals? (Every neighborhood has one) This month you'll be looking over wondering what that Phat beat is!! LOL
B00AB7HESI|5.0|this game is awesome.you amagene it.create.and do what ever you want with. but all you should know<br />is that this game is amizint!
B001LYD2K4|5.0|I really like this record, its  a great follow up to the debut and with tracks like Axe man and Never trust a stranger you get some awesome Schenker moments within really great songs, no waiting through an OK song to get to Michaels leads the whole composition is a pleasure to listen to. A gem from when recordings were released with the intent that the listener would pay attention to each song.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|So far so good.  I have never setup anything so easily.  Did pretty much everything on its own.  Once I gave it access, it found the network on its own and connected to it using the password as well.  Has been mostly using the iPad to cast, as my MBP sort of freezes up because of Flash player on Chrome (sigh!!).  Streaming Netflix, Youtube goes very very smoothly.  The control with iPad is a bit cloogey, and it takes a bit of time to respond, a dedicated remote wouldn't have been bad.  But for the price and the free 3 month Netflix subscription, it is very well worth the $$s.
B001LYD2JU|5.0|This album was great when it debuted and with the addition of the bonus tracks its even better. I still prefer Schenker with UFO but this is different, his vision and a diverse well written debut. I have re-discovered this release now and it is once again in regular rotation.
B000I9WWCM|5.0|The Best Romantic Comedy !!! Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts together make you fall in love with Anna and Will. I have watched this movie over 1000 times and it makes me smile each and every time.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Finally a show for adults that is smart and isn't full of nudity and cuss words.  I love the actors and the writing.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love solitaire and have this on my Kindle and my Galaxy S3.  Makes waiting in airports, riding the metro, etc pass quickly.
B000ICKPOQ|1.0|Once again Amazon's India unit has totally screwed up one of my favorite series.  They have episodes from different seasons appearing in the first &#34;season', just like they did with Stargate SG1.  Thanks, Amazon.  Bring the jobs home and maybe you'll get better results.
B00ECUARO8|3.0|I just thought the movie was a little boring.  I found myself fast-forwarding through some parts.  I heard that it was a great movie, so I was really excited to watch it.  Needless to say I was disappointed.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|This is a great book and even better series!! Morgan Rice builds the characters well and leaves you wanting more at the end of every book. I would recommend this book to people of every age.
140006922X|5.0|Zealot is about the history leading up to the birth of Christ, his life in ministry, and after his death. It's fascinating reading and has opened my eyes to why some things in the scriptures don't seem to fit with other things written.
1451695195|4.0|Overall it is a good book that gives &#34;food for thought&#34;.  The negative is that it was written by a neurosurgeon in a very technical manner which makes it a little difficult for a layman to follow.  Overall, I would highly recommend it to skeptics and those seeking answers.  Just keep a medical dictionary on hand.
B000X2H8G4|4.0|You get what you pay for.  No background noise reduction but it does well amplifying sounds and for the price you can't go wrong.
B002XBVQKW|5.0|This had always been one of my favorite musicals. I really enjoy this title. My daughter just watch for the first times and liked it<br />Thanks.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Its really neat. I do like it, but with all the rubbing, I rubbed a hole in my iPod screen, lol
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I LOVE THIS..SOOO ADDICTIVE.Play this game if you love horses. Okay well i ran out of things to write so bye.
B00B4804KS|4.0|Watched in 3D, although it was good it did not have quite the same effect as if it was filmed in 3D.
B00DJLLO0M|2.0|I was a bit worried when I heard that Steven stepped away from Blackfield as being a co-writer. And disappointedly so, my worries were confirmed. Sadly, this is not my type of music. The lush string arrangements, the weak and more pop oriented song writing suffers without Steven's collaboration. I've tried several times to listen to it, but it's just not my style. I feel that Aviv is going to be searching for his own mark on this band in the future, but I'm not going to hold my breath for anything inspirational. If I need a Blackfield fix, I'll gladly put the first two remarkable cd's in my player. They were superb!
B00B19G01C|5.0|I watched this movie alone on my kindle and boy did it scare me.  Great horror movie. I love this one
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|For what it does, and what it will be able to do in the future, it's low price makes it a great value.  I use a PS3 as my primary Netflix device on my main HDTV, but the Chromecast lets me watch Netflix on my secondary bedroom TV.  I ordered my unit in time to receive the (now discontinued) 3-month Netflix credit, giving me an effective cost of $11, which is a steal.  When (not if) they come up with a way to play locally stored content, this thing will be even better.  (And it may not seem like it, but the fact that this is controlled by your phone/tablet/laptop and not with a separate remote is actually a big plus.)
B0000024YL|2.0|I only give more than one star because the songs are great ones, and some of them are decent recordings. However the album is completely inconsistent and the sound quality on some of them is terrible.  It really does sound like a bootleg.  Pick a different one.
B000002J6H|5.0|Lots of wonderful Stephen Still songs here with some interesting guests. Jimi Hendrix plays on Old Times Good Times. The album was released two months after Hendrix died and is dedicated to James Marshall Hendrix.
B002ASY6Q4|3.0|As I started to get into the book I began to encounter blurry pages at times. Other than that it is fine.
B00C81AVNU|5.0|Terrific music really well produced?  First timer Cyndi Lauper turns in an amazingly tuneful and inspirational score. Well deserved Tony!
B00BI73CVI|5.0|I love musicals. The music in here is to die for, just as the plot is.  I recommend it to everyone. I watched the movie with my brother, and he's not much of a musical guy, and he even enjoyed it.
B00ACP3OOM|5.0|the players with ear buds sound great but the buds cannot keep your ears from filling with water and blocking the sound for long. (I swim for 1 1/2 hours). Other bone conduction headsets were unreliable.  This is working great and sounds great too.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Reading this book now on my Kindle, enjoying it, had read reviews of the book that encouraged me to purchase it
B008EKMB82|5.0|Ozeki always surprises me.  She finds a way to weave very complex themes, such as bullying, suicide, zen practice, the ecological disaster of Fukushima, the immorality of war, the distinct cultural differences and rituals found in Japan vs. a small BC island, etc. into one story.  The journey through the characters lives was rich and profound.  The sign that this book was deeply meaningful to me was that I did not want the story to end.  I wanted to jump into the world that she created because it offered me so much insight.
B00CA6WLAE|4.0|Great continuance of the first book! Characters grew and the story was just as intriguing, if not more, that its predecessor.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Now if they could only pull off a Batman show along the same lines it would be awesome. If you get a chance watch it
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is a great game of you are a horse lover I recommended this game for you.<br />Best game ever!
B00E66QPCG|5.0|Let me start by saying that I write financial blogs for a number of small websites.  I'm don't, and have never, been a day trader but I understand the terms and the theories behind the market.<br /><br />That being said, I believe that I'm going to start day trading soon, right after I read this book another 2 or 3 times.  Not because it was hard to read (it wasn't) but because the information in \\"The Simple Strategy - A Powerful Day Trading Strategy For Trading Futures, Stocks, ETFs and Forex\\" is very complex, even though the way to USE the information is very simple.<br /><br />That's the catch.  Just like a person who knows what a hammer and nails are can't just build a house, a person who reads this book (and has no other experience) won't be able to start day trading right 'out of the box'.  This isn't a beginners guide to day trading, it's a book that someone who has already been day trading (possibly not successfully) can use to make their day trading easier and more profitable.<br /><br />Author Markus Heitkoetter is definitely an expert day trader and, even better, he's an expert at explaining how to use his system. Anyone who has experience in the stock market is going to quickly understand what he's talking about as well as all of the terms that he uses. A beginner will not have such an easy time however and will need to do a little research and take a good bit of time to practice in order to be successful.<br /><br />To his credit, the author recommends practicing as well and using caution, and he doesn't hype his strategy as the end all and be all to day trading. Rather he's very honest about what his system, if used correctly and followed specifically, should be able to provide.<br /><br />Again it's a very well written book and Mr. Heitkoetter definitely has an excellent system to offer. For anyone looking to be more successful with their day trading it's a must have.  For beginners it is certainly a book to have but not the 1st book that they should buy. (Not that he alludes to that in any way but the nature of humans is to see the word 'simple' and think 'anyone can do it'.)<br /><br />If you're a day trader looking for a simple yet powerful system that's better (probably) then you're already using (if you even have a system) then this is the book for you.  I enjoyed it and it will likely be the jumping off point for my own day trading activities. Highly recommended.<br /><br />PS  If you purchase this book you're going to get a great surprise however. A FREE copy of the author's other book \\"The Complete Guide to Day Trading\\".  THAT is the book all you newbies should read first and it's an excellent gift to be sure.buy.

0345803485|1.0|I don't like writing negative reviews of books, but I feel that this book deserves it.  Cutting to the chase,\\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" is poorly written, lacks character development and caters more to a vanilla/conservative crowd. Most of the BDSM folks that I am acquainted with guffaw in it's general direction. Honestly I feel that it has earned it's place in the donation bag for Good Will.  Thanks.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. it is easy but it is all about timing. it is a great horse game.  Love it! !
0385339100|5.0|This book will be given to a friend who also likes John Grisham's books. I don't consider it his best work, but even the worst book that Mr. Grisham will ever write will still be heads above most other authors. I received it quickly and it was noted to be as described by the sender.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I've had a good time with this game. Good for the young & ol'  brain to keep figuring a way.
B009K0P10K|5.0|I thought after season 1 the plot couldn't get any better but boy was I wrong! Me and my fiance both are obsessed with this show! It has enough suspense and drama that isn't over the top but leaves you wanting to watch more. A wonderful series
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This game is well done.  Story adds to the  fun. Colors, details &amp; animation<br /><br /> are  fantastic . Also it is responsive .
B0097HSS4M|5.0|Like editing my photos on here. Easy to use like instagram and you can share instances as well. I don't have an instagram so this is a great alternative
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|This cable was a replacement for the original that fell apart.  Seems the plastic outer coating was not manufactured correctly and within a few years just broke and crumbled into little pieces.  The best thing about this is that AMAZON stood by it's product and replace it free of charge.  I can't say if this one will last longer but I do hope they did fix the problem.  Kudos to AMAZON for standing by their product.  The original I would give a 1 start for Amazon service I give a 5 star that is why it stands at a 3 star.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Great time to pass the time and get ideas. Love the inspiration I get as well. Overall great idea and app!
B00991TCOG|5.0|Her music is excellent to write to, to relax to, even to meditate to.  Stirling meshes the classic sound of the violin with the modern swagger of dubstep.  The lyrical quality is such that even people who hate 'dubstep' can still enjoy this CD.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I am so glad to have found this app! I watch a lot of videos and I got irritated by all the ads YouTube plays. Their is ads and some commercials on this but not as bad as YouTube.com. also it plays videos really fast
B008469DGY|4.0|good graphics entertaining fun easy to play but you can increase your play and create fun twists to the flick
B0030MM68O|4.0|The realism was incredible.  How sad that we have to have so much violence in our lives.  I felt for the main character who is so into violence and putting another notch on his belt.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I find most of today's writers , so lacking in those writers of the classic's. I guess people have been dumbed down by the educational system of today and the pitiful television and movies generated in Hollywood, that they really do not know food writing when they see or Do NOT see it.
B00CMYRVAO|4.0|I love this CD!! I hate how underrated Joe is, he always puts out quality albums and his voice is perfect. I love the throwback vibe of this album, I just hate that's its so short!! Top 5:<br /><br />5. Sexy - Yes this song is sexy and knows how to keep it sexy and classy :)<br /><br />4. Doubleback - Nice song, its different for Joe but it suits him just fine.<br /><br />3. Love and Sex - Wow, Joe and Fantasia sound awesome together! I love this song!!!<br /><br />2. Something For You - This one is classic Joe. Sounds like it belongs on \\"Signature\\" but its a perfect opener for this album.<br /><br />1. Mary Jane - OMG! When I first heard this song it reminded me of \\"All that I Am\\" Im in LOVE with the sound and tone. Classic Joe at is best!
B00DHKKN6Q|2.0|Even though you clear a level, you lose and can't go to the next level. It tells you that your score is too low.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I reaaly reaaly love this game hope all people who play really lime it to hope this helps u to
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is so addicting once you start you cant stop! I've been playing nonstop for days! Such good graphics and its not too easy.  Great game for all ages!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Loved it! Can't wait for the next season to start! So sad about Matthew though, He will be seriously missed!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I was concerned about staying the course in this 700+ page book, but Stephen King is a fabulous storyteller and this was a long, but captivating story. In addition to wanting to see it through-to see if the mission is actually accomplished-the premise of this book really does get you thinking. I think the question is, if given the opportunity to change history, which tragedies would you try to change? Personal tragedies? Global disasters? Events of political and historical significance? Looking forward to chatting with other readers of 11/22/63!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|This show is the best that HBO has ever done, you never know whats going to happen next, I am looking for fall to start the next run++++++
B004X80QNG|1.0|Horrible interface that doesn't match screenshots. Learning curve is fairly steep. Very complicated...  Save your mmoney even if free app of the day.
B007D2XSW0|2.0|I have not been able to save the edited pictures, even though there is a floppy tab meaning the save symbol. It is not clear where it save, if it does.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|It's still an excellent family film! This is one of those top ten &#34;classics&#34; I intend to watch with my 5 year old son and 11 year old daughter.  Not to mention my wife, who has never seen a bunch of american classics (from our generation).<br />Classics I have recently exposed them to include:<br />Top Gun<br />Karate Kid<br />Can't Buy Me Love<br /><br />Others I intend to expose them to include:<br />Back to the Future<br />Terminator<br />Better off Dead
B005544TRQ|5.0|After watching the first episode, I was immediately hooked! I love the characters, as well as the story lines. Great writing!
B00C0IYPRY|5.0|I hadn't re-watched this movie in over 20 years and it still has the same affect now as it did then. Awesome movie! The best part is my 11 year old daughter seemed to really enjoy it; so did my wife who had surprisingly never seen it.
B00E5Q1HJS|4.0|An interesting film that gives great performances and leaves you wanting more. Star Trek fans will enjoy the different take that only a parallel universe can provide.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Very good story. Characters are well developed and interesting.  It is a very interesting tale with a rich texture of the times.  I recommend it!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I really liked it, has a different point of view and leaves you trying to understand Charlie, some will identify, some will wish they could write in such a way and others might think he just went nuts, which reader are you?
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great show, always suspenseful. Gets better with every season.  Can't wait for season 4 to start.  Amazon Instant works great for this show but the HD version isn't worth the money.
B008476HBM|5.0|Can you read anything bad in Classics? If you liked the movie, you'll love the book more, no one can replace a good book for a representation of it.
B000PAAH3K|5.0|Informative, coherent, fascinating, and difficult to put down.  How many times in person's life do we make what seems like an instantaneous decision, think about that decision, change it and then we were right with the original decision.  The capability of our senses to instinctively process input is far greater than our ability to think
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|Wasn't what I expected. I really could not get into it. It wasn't my type of game. Just didn't like it.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I love it when spirit and science get mixed together. I've tried 3 experiments so far and yes there are miracles happening all around me.After reading E-Squared, I'm paying more attention to the world around me and having fun.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|Good movie and the fights were pretty good. Ther actors did a  better job then what i thought they they were going to do.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|It works very well, so far no problems with it.  Very user friendly, my grand daughter loves to play it.
B002361MLA|5.0|This book is my Bible !!!! MUST READ for anyone that wants a better life. You can never read this book to many times
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|My new series addiction!!! Be prepared to be sucked into Jace and Clary's world, and not surface in the real world until it's time to buy the next book!
B0018BB20W|5.0|I have owned this album in all the various formats except MP3. The rendition of The Animals song &#34;please don't let me be misunderstood&#34; though not on the original recording but featured in the bonus tracks is magical. Everything about this album is a masterpiece of progressive rock.That you can seriously not own or share this album is tragic.That you can find no pleasure in listening to this album is a true tragedy.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|This is a fun game, but it has too many issues.  It freezes a lot, doesn't give you your rewards all the time, goes to lobby or starts over when you are playing the daily tournament or the slots. Have thought about uninstalling the app. May happen soon.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|It is very entertaining and its free with amazon prime! The hulk is my favorite character. It is very worth whatever it costed to make the film.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|After seeing the film twice, I wanted to share with friends who missed it or were housebound. They loved it so much they immediately ordered the film plus cds. Now my son has taken my dvd so I may need to order another if he won't give it back or passes it forward!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Wonderful writing, great acting, English humour, and no foul language, nudity or violence. There is always a new twist you don't see coming. All this, with a bit of history written in, for those who aren't history buffs. It's a great series. I am anxious for Season 4.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|If you are looking for a different story line, this book is for you.  If you are a flower lover, you will find this fascinating.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Wasn't sure if I would like, but I was hooked after season 1.  Now, I can't wait until season 4.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|I agree with &quot;Shamus&quot; in that to truly thrive (or even just survive) one would have to pony up $.  But I can't fault Gameloft for this as that seems to be the current trend, offering a game or app for free, then charging real money for 'in-app purchases', some of which are necessary to advance to high levels or unlock certain features.<br /><br />But the gameplay is enjoyable, with a look just like DH3 but with more of a story.  Granted, it ain't Skyrim but it also isn't $60 either!  The graphics are quite good, vivid with a good flow.  The combat is simple but fun to unleash special powers when surrounded by a demon horde.<br /><br />It's the shop, however, that can kill you, since the most common currency for potions, armor, weapons and such are gems, oddly the ONE thing you almost never find in your quest.  You find gold everywhere but I don't know what it is good for!<br /><br />All in all, I have enjoyed GH4 enough that I always keep an eye out for other Gameloft offerings.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Lots of fun and somewhat challenging.  Better than any other marjong game I have played.  Lots of variety to keep it interesting.  Only con is that the quest mode ends really fast, needs more to it.
B00B5P37IG|1.0|there are no good stations.  the US stations are just religious or government and I am not interested in foreign stations.<br /> Nothing worth watching.
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|With the different tables available with this purchase it turns a good program into a really great game, wellworth the money
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The story unravels slowly, almost to the point where you may fear it's just another Grisham novel with the same story line and want to stop reading it altogether... But hang in there. The second half of the story takes twits, turns and leaves you with unexpected surprises.
B0023SDPS6|4.0|It takes a while for Longmire to grow on a person. As for me, i sort of plodded along through the novel until I realized that it was like visiting with an old friend. There are subtle twists and turns that keep ones interest until it rapidly builds to an unexpected climax. Longmire comes across as a believable character in spite of 'Artistic License' taken by the author throughout, but who cares. The non-existant Wyoming county suddenly become familiar. Having spent a number of years in Wyoming, the scenes depicted may not be factually accurate, but Craig Johnson manages to capture the 'feel' of that Big Sky Country. I would recommend this as a starter for the series. If you like this one, you'll enjoy the follow-up stories.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Loved the entire story and the description of afterlife was amazing.  It was very comforting and totally endorsed what I  already believe.  When the author got into the medical and scientific aspects,  it got a little boring.  It was like reading a thesis.  The photograph he received at the end of his story was the cherry on the ice cream sundae !
B00005KAQP|5.0|I remember when my family took me to see this movie at a drive-in movie theater in Noblesville,Indiana when I was 3 years old. I had rented it on video twelve years ago because I didn't remember alot of it and had forgotten how funny it is. Last year, I was in Wal-Mart and I saw the DVD on sale for $5 so I bought it because I have waited a while to have It in my collection. A couple of days later, I bought the sequel which I had previously on VHS but was getting all worn out so I now have both movies on DVD. I also have the CD soundtracks. Great movie For the whole family!!!!!!!!! Peter Smith
B0074MZSWW|5.0|Who doesn't love music! This is a great CD to add to the collection.  Very happy with my purchase and look forward to added more.
6305433909|5.0|I bought this DVD to replace a VHS tape that was getting all worn out. Now I have both movies on DVD. I wish they would make a \\"Sister Act 3\\", that would be really something!!!!!!!!!! Great Family Movies!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Peter Smith
B00D4FDNIO|5.0|I absolutely love this album, best electronic album of the summer in my opinion.  I am too lazy to break down my thoughts on each track, but I would estimate I absolutely love 80% of the tracks and \\"like\\" the remaining ones.  The vocals are great, I love the sultry vocals, loops and hooks peppered throughout.  A dance album that works for the dancefloor, but has the depth to be appreciated in the car or through your headphones.  If you love independently produced dance music, and tire of the constant deluge of derivative DJ drivel, I can't imagine a better album to pick up this year.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|The first time we played it we kind of messed up with the rules but it ended up being very enjoyable! First game we played for hours, very fun!
B005NQ5LQ4|4.0|Very happy with this item. It was a good deal. I look forward to the rest of the movies to see.
0810979772|5.0|Book was perfect for my 9 year old brother. Loved how the book asked you questions about yourself. Great interactive book.
B004GTKP3S|5.0|Light entertainment, and the actresses were brillant.  A good way to pass a weekend at home.  Good for kids too.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is great if you like puzzles. It is a bit short and leaves you wanting more. Can't wait for part 2
B00006YXJ5|5.0|One one his best recordings. Sound quality s great, the songs a sweet, and have you singing along with him.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This book was amazing!  Very dark story line but beautifully written. This was my first book by this author and needless to say I will be reading many more by her.  Seems like most books these days have the possessive love interest that turns into a happily ever after, but not this one.  Kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. I would recommend this book to anyone!
B003AYBC6E|5.0|My favorite Tom Waits lp.. Love the recording, truly a vinyl recording to have in any collection. Vinyl is quiet .
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this app ..so much fun to play in your spare time  .. I like how it has more games than just bingo
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I bought this as a gift for someone.  My niece had given me one.  Loved it so much, I just had to pass it on.<br />Drumming and base in these songs is phenomenal.
1451696191|3.0|I really thought I would never say this but I thought the movie was better. The actors were great,funny and played their parts with great pathos.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is a very fun game with all the challenges, missions and prizes. Also the different sceneries and characters you can play with. The one problem was I wanted to get a character and it was only available for a limited time and I was not able to get enough coins to get it.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed it - only disappointment was that the movie was not part of it, but I found an episode or two I had never seen.  I still believe that this is one of the very best since Roswell....
B006LSZECO|3.0|A quick read, but it didn't offer many surprises and the ending was disappointing. It felt like the author couldn't think of a good way to end it and just put together a quick ending.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I am supposed to thank the author for writing a book I couldn't put down when I had so many important things to do? Yes. Thanks!
B00A9ET4MC|4.0|After a slow start, I was once again completely into her story and could not put the book down.  Already looking for the next Adichie story.
B0078ZTWP4|5.0|This lantern is not very big in size, but it lets enough light to light up a whole room, which is what I was looking for.
B00E978FGQ|5.0|My teen sons and I both love this movie. We saw it twice in the theater and bought it for home. It's one of those movies you can watch repeatedly and still enjoy thoroughly.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book was amazing. I could not put it down. Kyle's writing makes everything seem so real without romanticizing it. I would recommend this book to any war veteran, historian, or just someone looking for a great read.
B00B1MHXY2|5.0|Will more than likely purchase more of Fleetwood Mac for this medium. I have their music on different medium vinyl, CD' s and now my kindle .
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I do love it. It is fun. I recommend it for ages 10+ years a through adulthood.  It is a challenging and promotes problem solving.  It has a variety of games in it to keep it fun.
B008469DGY|2.0|it was fun at first, but I got bored with it fast, pretty big app for what it is. I don't play many games,this is a good reason why.
B003YUUL5M|2.0|Sole very thin. whole  thing feels flimsy. no room for insoles. sent them back. I think Crocs fell short on this one.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is addictive.. really enjoy the animation. This most recent update fixed all the issues that I have run across.
B00AECGQF2|3.0|It keeps the kido entertained for a little bit, but the noises the girl makes sounds like she is having intercourse
B005HSL626|5.0|It is very exciting games for the family. We play it hours at a time.Its games you can play very day.
B00280LYIC|5.0|such a good book! I love it soooooo sooooooo much! It was so exiting I could not put it down for the life of me! Percys adventures are so exiting. as one review on the back says &#34; electrifying moments chasing each other like heartbeats.&#34; I totally recommend it.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It is a fun game to play, lot of action, you have run for your life to stay in the games.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|First time user.  Will not go back to using former site easy yt? o use all information at a glance.  My favorite  feature is the humidity gage
B005LCECU6|5.0|This is a great addition to any huge RUSH fans collection.  &#34;In The End&#34;, &#34;Need Some Love&#34; and the &#34;Drum Solo&#34; are the best tracks on the disc.
B009B1UZ7C|5.0|Just when I had gotten depressed about the future of music, seeing Lady Gaga or Miley Cyrus selling far more albums than their talent would imply is possible, I found this album. Every track is melodic, well written, and well sung. Though I'm generally a fan of the singer-songwriter genre, this is an exceptional example of it. Just listen to the sample tracks. It's like the early Beatles and Nick Drake had a musical lovechild. Just buy this, you won't regret it.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Fantastic program. Smart, witty, suspenseful, well-acted drama. Well written, well directed, well produced, and very well acted. I highly recommend that you watch it, just watch it!
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|This game is fun for being free not a lot of story line but you can come back and play daily your energy and other special items regenerate after a certain amount of time all in all an ok game
B0041JLUIM|5.0|This movie had a little of everything for an action/drama/sci-fi/gross out type movie. Acting was awesome and the story was actually pretty good. Little dark on the cinematography in some cases.
B00EQUP3Q6|4.0|Stands up well with other albums.  After listening to it, it's definitely one of the better albums.  Excellent production work.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Not much I can say that hasn't already been said many times over. This is the best value CPU cooler on the market.
B00ESZYDOM|4.0|A good performance by three competent musicians.  Great renditions of ELP pieces.  Tarkus is worth the money.  The solo tracks work.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|Plugged into my Surface Pro, worked instantly. I Will be using this in China where not all hotels have wifi.
B00E5INZ82|3.0|It really is a pretty good drag racing game,the 3star are strictly a personal opinion. I must have misread something before dwindling, l simply didn't see anything about drag racing.l thought it was a traditional racing game like asphalt or real facing
B00EDF43MY|5.0|My nephews love this adorable game. They love getting stickers for their suitcase and they won't stop asking me for my kindle to play it.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Of all the things I have got to date I think I like this one the best and use it the most...it really helps knowing what your actual battery level is...I got my kindle to use hunting and fishing and it sucks getting out there with a low battery because someone else was on it. This is easy...effective and a very useful program and highly recommended
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I used to just have the normal version and I would love to watch the time travle vidios (and I still love watching them) but I was wandering the app store and saw this app! it is sooo worth your dollar.<br />(sorry bout spelling eras)
B0097HSS4M|4.0|This is fun to play with but the one big beef I have with it is if you modify a photo with it it will not create a new photo...the original is lost and changed forever. Be sure you changed it the way you want it to start.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|I remember the original series from the 70s it was good but this one is much more exciting.  Worth the time.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Well I just love this game in general and this one is fun to play...I prefer the classic but there are other game modes to play here as well...If you like this game you will enjoy this program.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Not how I expected it to end, could've done without the beginning recap. Entertaining nonetheless.  Looking forward to the movie.
B0047SKR54|3.0|Not a bad movie really...just an odd twist on a controversial era that has had a huge amount of films made about it...It seems to be fairly low budget but yet remains entertaining to watch just to find out what is going to happen in the end. I enjoyed the movie yet can't say I will be sitting on pins and needles wanting to see it again.
B000P0J09C|1.0|This is a five-star film distributed in a zero-star format. Regardless of the tangled history behind the decision to release the film this way for home video before the advent of widespread widescreen television  (see the JT comment at http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WRJVNJJXV7IT/ref=cm_cr_dp_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000P0J09C&nodeID=2625373011&store=movies-tv#wasThisHelpful), Stanley Kubrick's shot composition does not deserve the kind of treatment Michaelangelo's La Pieta sculpture got from the maniac who took a hammer to it. Note that this crucial \\"modified to fit your screen\\" factor is left off the basic product description, nor will you find it on the cover or spine of this unit. The widescreen version is now available, so do yourself and the film a favor and spurn this damaged version. Maybe Warner Bros. will see the light and withdraw it from distribution.
B004TI1WME|5.0|This works just fine...would work for things like grocery shopping or others when your trying to keep track of a list of items and just as a basic calculator
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very entertaining for myself and 3 kids. Only thing is more levels is needed to be added so its not repetitive
B008P1EWIM|5.0|this program seems to stay up to date no matter where I am...very happy with it.I go on a lot of hunting and fishing trips and am glad to have this program.
B009RX85N0|5.0|My daughter to completely hooked on this series and the price was great.  She can hardly wait for season three to begin
B0017SWSCW|5.0|I love Jeffrey Archer's books. he is a great author. The characters were interesting and so was the story line.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Google did an awesome job with this product. Now I get to enjoy all the good YouTube videos on my TV. Wating on more apps to be available.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|I happened to like this movie a lot.  I received as ordered in the condition as ordered and all is well.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|You should get this game if you have Facebook you can challenge your friends and it's totes FUNN!!!! @nd totally FREEE
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Same as the first...the story is interesting enough to keep me reading, but it reads as if the entire book was written with a thesaurus. Weird...to big words when they aren't needed.
B0035QUXWQ|5.0|Finally watched it with my 14 and 12 year old girls.  It does contain more strong language than I remembered and some sexual content, but they survived it (and enjoyed it).
B00DPKQ60A|4.0|Longtime fans of Grande will rejoice and continue worshiping. This review isn't for them, because they'll buy the album anyway. For those of you tottering on the edge: yes, the album is worth it to hear the freshest voice in pop at the moment, but try a couple songs first.<br /><br />It didn't disappoint, and even exceeded expectations. Good original songs with a couple of tracks previously released. Nothing to complain about there. However, her \\"original\\" sound has been tried and true by many other artists. Half of her music is piano ballads, the other R&B. While it's somewhat different because of her voice, various songs across the album are strikingly similar and after a while they all seem to blend together. Honeymoon Avenue, Piano, and Almost is Never Enough are all distinct standouts, but the rest are generally passable. That isn't to say that the album is bad. Taken as a whole, the album is a strong debut but with a good amount of room for improvement.<br /><br />She's already being compared to Mariah Carey, but obviously she will never have the musical influence or talent that MC did. Nevertheless, the album is solid and worth a listen.
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|I just started playing but was impressed from the beginning. The graphics are awesome and it is very easy to follow which place to go to next. The strategy guide is easy to access if you need it but the hints help a lot. Pretty expensive but I think it will be worth every penny.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|This is a great album, it's absolutely a must buy for anybody that really enjoys the bands already released singles.
B007C12RDS|4.0|I was quickly enchanted by the Timmons family, Dorcus, Laura, Twister, Queenie, et al. It is a quiet series and a great way to wind down with a glass of wine at the end of a busy, loud day
B008VVT51U|5.0|A fun movie for all of us to enjoy.  A movie with a lot of heart.  A must see for all.
B000002MP2|5.0|Looked as if it was bought brand new from a music store 20 years ago.  Even the insert is complete. Love it. Will definitely use Amazon again for future music purchases!
B001DJLCRC|1.0|I see this is quite a popular series but it was too raunchy for us. We only watched one episode and were a little shocked at a couple sex scenes and the language. We saw enough in one episode to realize this series in not for us!
B000003TA4|5.0|Looked as if it was bought brand new from a music store 20 years ago.  Even the insert is complete. Love it. Will definitely use Amazon again for future music purchases!
B002E0JL4A|5.0|well played... intellectual...comedy...super genious...innovative...kind hearted movie...watch again and again... never get bored... willing to watch again to get mrore from strory
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Great app. I u use it every day for guitar lessons in YouTube.<br />Thanks for it. Keep me posted on app like this.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This game is so much fun. It makes you think. And there is a lot of comedy in those sign posts.
B008469DGY|5.0|This is not a golf game. Since it calls itself one, it is tempting to dock it a point or two for misrepresentaion. However, it is a game that could conceivably be played on a golf course, so in my view it narrowly escapes that penalty...albeit only on a technicality The game really being played here is horseshoes, although these are horseshies with rollers that allow you to apply backspin and other &quot;english&quot; to the shoe. Thats really the only distinctive Golf aspect to the game. That being said, it does horseshoes right proud in terms of gameplay and enjoyment, and technically it's very polished as well, with nice graphics--can't comment on the sound necause I own a phone that doesnt ring due to a broken something-or-other--and nary a bug or glitch in sight. My only complaint is that distances are hard to judge on my little phone screen (my problem, really) and that a little more guidance about curving shots in the tutorial wouldnt have hurt. Nevertheless, this remains, in my view, (by the skin of its teeth) a five-star game and that's the rating I'm giving it.
B0058VW36U|4.0|Om nom is addictive. That is all I feel like saying. And that Momentum is key to everything, please remember that always.
B008YW5RH2|5.0|Straightforward, visceral, challenging, very enjoyable tennis. If you want absolute realism, look elsewhere, but if you want fun this is the game for you. Five stars.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|If you look at the stores, you can see all of the different types of blades, should I feel like I need to speed slice fruit all of the time?
1451695195|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. I do research and write in the field of bioethics and found this work helpful both professionally and personally. The author is a truly remarkable and exceptional person. In this case the author himself is just as interesting in what he writes about.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Fun even for an adult<br />The only thing is to really progress you need to buy pearls<br />It is nice to get the characters from the movie
B00BIPCY14|5.0|Well, can't say much about it.  You will either love it or dislike it.  Not much for the middle ground with this series.
B00003CXI1|5.0|This is a great movie and a great edition of the movie for less than it cost to get the Non-special edition!  My kids have watched it a couple dozen times and I see it being watched another couple dozen more.  Great story about friendship and magic.  As the story goes on from year to year the tone gets darker and I find everyone gets a little nastier so we like to escape into this one.  Still pretty good for little kids, not TOO scary but good for adults as well.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|No matter how you doll up this story, it's still about people with too much money and time on their hands... yes, it's relevant to today and yet, I felt Baz used over the top visual elements to distract from the fact that most of the main characters had very little moral fiber or compassion... UGH!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Always be aware that what ever you post will become public, having said that I enjoy being able to keep in touch with friends and relatives frequently.
B005HSGB6W|5.0|A gripping and engaging story on human nature, violence and free will. Mostly written in Nadsat (a fictional slang), it requires a lot of devotion to read. A real classic literary adventure through Hell.
B00E5INZ82|5.0|Game will keep you on the edge of your seat. It's worth it. Awesome game but you will run out of gas and money fast.
B007SGM084|5.0|I really enjoyed the love story and reading about two people with different upbringings coming together and learning how to be a couple into a husband and wife. This was a great book and I can't wait for more.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Just like all of her books, keeps you interested and wanting to read the next chapter. Was sorry when it ended.
B008Y6WMEY|5.0|Classic.  Great cast, who doesn't love Peter Sellers?  And Slim Pickins - one of the most memorable film scenes in history is him riding the bomb and waiving his hat while he does.
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|Incredible novel...it took me home to my childhood and visits to family in the Prairies. Beautifully written, fascinating tale of disappointment, loss and survival. This story haunts me on many levels.<br /><br />Canadian in California
B004UFEJXK|5.0|How to resist to this little robot? Did I say robot? Wall-e is an exception to what a robot could be.. able to recognize emotions and feelings, even when having his mother board changed.... gotta give it a chance &#60;3
B003DS9ECQ|1.0|Inane plot, poor animation, not the least bit entertaining.  Bill Murray delivers the only funny line in 90 minutes of otherwise unwatchable dreck.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|These songs are perfect for the person who enjoys romantic music.  there was also a PBS broadcast named &#34;Love in Portofino&#34; which set the tone for this album,
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I was so engrossed in this book from the beginning, couldn't put it Down. I went to  sleep 2 : 30 am because I had to see how it ended. Unbelievably, I woke up this morning wanting more. I am so ready for the movie!
B0081336FO|5.0|Great suspense-  Once you get past the British accent you'll love it. the casting is wonderful and the plot as well.
B001NFNFNA|5.0|I like that this movie is a true story.  The acting is great and the story is really good. I would recommend this.
B0052AC8C6|3.0|It was a cute movie. The characters were designed well, especially the girl. You really wished there was a good ending for them all. Very illogical. I didn't think about it at all after viewing it. I wouldn't see it again but I was curious enough to see it once.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is an amazing game. any one like games were you think a lot this is the game for you
B004KKX814|5.0|They boys recently discovered these and have spent hours pretending while they &#34;rip&#34; the beys into the arena(purchased separately). They are as expected and will buy again.
B000EXDS5M|4.0|The movie and Paul Newman, a great actor and philanthropist that<br />never disappointed the movie-goers.  &#34;Raindrops keep falling on my head&#34;<br />while riding a bicycle and looking at Miss Ross in all splendor- Excellent!
B003K16P3M|5.0|Ok, I know this might sound cheesy, but this is THE BOOK. You know, that book that has EVERYTHING included; or the full package.<br /><br />It includes:<br />» a mystical main character who is a strong and brave heroine,<br />» powers (but different than a wizard's magic),<br />» romance that you lust for in your life,<br />» kings, queens, princesses, dukes, and princesses,<br />» and action that is gory, but not fully described... if you are a person who hates the sight or reference of blood like I am, and are hesitating to get this book, let me say this;<br />It is detailed enough for you to understand and comprehend what is happening, but not a lot of gross and revolting descriptions (so not as gory as it sounds)<br /><3<br /><br /><<<<<DA PUT-PUT HAS SPOKEN>>>>>
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|i'm actually rather disappointed i didn't see this in theaters now that i've seen it on netflix. this is one FUN f***ing movie to watch! like Pacific Rim it's not deep or thought provoking, just FUN!
B001MSMULG|5.0|I was promised a good read, beginning the Gabriel Allon series. I was not disappointed.  Looking forward to the continuing series; I understand the historical elements are well researched, a very important criteria for me. Thank you Daniel Silva.
B008469DGY|5.0|this is a great game to play even if your not a golfer. i'm having a blast playing it.its fun to play.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This g game is the best app ever created!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I cannot wait for the next update! Game is cool about how you stranded on a world and must survive by making,placing,and destroying blocks.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Must read for all of my friends and a book  club favorite.  Made  me excited to read the other ones
B00633W614|5.0|Loved it ..eloquent and with great imagination..this story is about redemption ..victory and the human condition with and without God ..will read everyone of this mans books..yet they are addicting! in a good way ..stories of hope
0984183523|5.0|I strongly recomend This book for anyone who want to get a job as a consultant! This book has good tips for those who does not want to memorize a lot of frameworks.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|A great no BS read. I loved it! Totally confirmed I am on the right path. Watch out here I come.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|THIS IS A GREAT GAME FOR THOSE WHO LIKE TO USE THEIR HEADS.  SOME PUZZLES ARE HARDER THAN OTHERS BUT THEY ARE FUN AND I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO OTHERS.
B005LQ6UE8|5.0|A tribute to the human spirit and the will to live. The story shows how strong of mind and body a person can be. Don't ever give up!
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I started streaming this after binge streaming &#34;24,&#34; so I was coming off of the pacing and suspense of that series. It took me 5 or 6 episodes to get into The Good Wife, but now I'm hooked. The writing is good and characters are complex and 3-dimensional. I'm on season 2 now and really enjoying it.
0321928482|5.0|I wanted to post a partial review in advanced (before I have actually read the book) in response to the only other review at this time (posted by H. J. Beth).  H. J Beth's review warned others that the online download content was not accessible.  I received my book today (9/6/13) and I just successfully downloaded 11 lessons worth of content.  So whatever problem may have existed (if any), it has been corrected.<br /><br />For now I will leave my rating at 5 stars just to counter the 1 star rating.  As I go through the book, I will update my review.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|Excellent and addicting show!! Good quality and am watch on iPhone. Great purchase and keeps you on edge of your seat.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I love this game. it is my absolute favorite. I play it everyday. its the first thing I do in the morning.
B00E0MCYPS|2.0|The graphics to the game look great which is why ai decided to try it out but unfortunately there is no tutorial on how beat to use the game.  There should be something to explain the mechanics of the game and bit found nothing on how to steer. Plus, it's way too sensitive and constantly taking you off course amd making it very difficult to get back on track. Once those issues are fixed it would be a great game.
B00A2H9OZS|4.0|Almost on the same level as Pitch Black and a huge return to form after The Chronicles of Riddick. Vin Diesel in his best role delivers memorable lines and lethal kills. The CGI is very good and the movie has a good build up and payoff. The ending could have been better than the quick one chosen, but Riddick is a worthy action/sci-fi/horror hybrid that reminds us why Vin Diesel was a star to watch after 2000's Pitch Black.
B00CIAZ04G|5.0|This is for true Kung Fu movie junkies. The fights are fantastic! Of course it's English subtitled... the words are not very accurate and they might move too quickly for some viewers.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Probably our favorite show of all time! Awesome! Funny, smart, exciting- all of the characters are great, and every episode is fantastic.
B00CHIM0VU|5.0|The fight scenes are fantastic just like the first IP Man. The story continues..<br />It's subtitled in English and the words may move a little fast for some people, but the story is just as good as the first in the sequence.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|Merlin the series is the first TV series I have ever purchased on DVD. I absolutely loved this show, and have watched it numerous times. I do not watch reruns so when I couldn't get enough of this show I had to purchase it. My 5 year old granddaughter loved it as well, and it was a safe show for her to watch because there was never nudity or foul language.
B002O6FBW0|2.0|I think I am too young to get the value that people hold in this film. I am not a fan of old film so it should come as no surprise to me that I didn't enjoy this one either. I respect people's choices to their own preference so I hope not to offend but, the production value of this and almost all early film is, is bad. I don't really mind the sub-titling, or the added in music to a pre-talkie film. The fact that this was supposed to be scary just makes me laugh. And the super over acting is ridiculous. I bet that fans of plays would enjoy this type of thing more than the rest.
B008JF8O9M|1.0|I used to have a better print app and with my new phone I could not find this app.  I tried the PrintBot and quickly deleted it because it will not do what I want.
B00E978FGQ|5.0|This was a very great movie, pretty good twist at the end, one of the best movies I have seen.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really enjoy this game.  its funny and fun at the same time.  I recommend this game to anyone and everyone.
B00AA0U05A|5.0|One of my favorite CD's which I take in the car when leaving home.  Brings back a ton of memories in my era especially....Very happy with my purchase.  Thank you
B00AESN8XY|5.0|If you like strategy games, this is for you. I love this game so much, and I just keep playing.
B005H9B44A|5.0|Great all around movie, being a huge Marvel fan. I love the fact they are doing their comic book movies right.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The characters were fascinating, the dialogue realistic, and the plot nearly perfect.  This author is new to me, but I'll look for more by her.
B00DGKQF2S|5.0|This is a great offering from what I would consider a &#34;super group&#34;. There isn't a bad song on it. If you like real rock and roll, then this is for you!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is is very fun and it never gets boring there are many thing you can do I recommend it
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Grabs your interest right away, about two young boys finding a fugitive hiding on a small island.  McConaughey is very good in his role, but I couldn't see how a man with his &#34;smarts&#34; could not see through the Reese Witherspoon character.  What kept my interest were the two youngsters who gained my empathy through their down-to-earth acting, both seemingly at ease in their roles.
B00AVPYT8I|4.0|I would like to see more current best seller authors available.  I've just started using the product and can write more when I use it more.....
0553328255|5.0|the whole series of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is all into two books. the stories are interesting. the language used seems to be more of the old English style.
B000ZECQ08|1.0|I only received the special edition disc (Disc 2) and the online code for the online copy was expired so I didn't even receive the actual movie that I paid for. Really disappointed because I bought this for my girlfriend for her birthday.
B00E0MCYPS|5.0|I can't write 3 paragraphs on an app like the rest of these psychos, but I did enjoy the game.
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|Buddy Guy has the talent that makes him a timeless artist who will be making listeners happy for years and years!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Excellent story! Couldn't stop watching.from the opening Titanic scene to the season ender, a gripping tale of life and love.
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|We tried to watch it through our Sony Google TV but could not get sound. It froze at the start and did not get through. We turned it up a few times and tried different things but in the end we just watched another film.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|Nicely surprised by RED - starring Bruce Willis (smirk firmly in place) as Frank Moses, a middle-aged guy in suburbia, living on a pension, who keeps calling the pension office to lie about his monthly checks not arriving because he has a bit of a crush on customer service rep Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker). Sarah is bored and lonely and wanting adventure in her life ... and gets more than she could ever hope for when someone from Frank's past sends a battalion of commando-like assassins to kill him - the bad guys going after Sarah, in turn, as she's been the only person Frank has contacted in some time! Frank, forced to sort of kidnap Sarah just to rescue her, goes on the run, but is soon forced back into his old \\"line of work\\" when he has to put together his team of deadly agents from the past - all of them now classified as \\"RED\\" (Retired, Extremely Dangerous) - to stay alive and find out just what the hell is going on.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this film, filled with action and suspense but also humor. John Malkovich, the brilliant Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman, Karl Urban, and Richard Dreyfuss round out one hell of a supporting cast, and even with a slightly hokey ending this is still an enjoyable romp that provides both thrills and laughs. Hope the sequel works as well!
B00B19G01C|4.0|I liked how there weren't a lot of special effects to get in the way. one of the better possession movies.  worth a watch.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|So far so good.  I like it!  No crashes or bog-downs.  Considering the limits of my tablet. This game works pretty well.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|If you watched the series, you may be interested in the book like I was. I have always been intrigued with the prison system and whenever I pass by a prison surrounded by bob-wire fence, I look in wonder what it must be like inside. Piper Kerman shares her unique and personal experience through her book. The movie is somewhat aligned with her novel, but has taken liberties with the story to make the series more tv worthy I suppose. Piper tells her true story and it is fascinating. She gives us a glimpse of the system, its corruption, its inhumanity, its unsustainability, and more. I enjoyed the novel and felt she did a good job. It left me wanting to learn more. I wish she could have gone more into some of the other characters/people in the prison, before and after.
B000002L9Y|5.0|Following the good but commercially disappointing `Tusk' in 1979 and its unremarkable 1982 follow-up `Mirage', the five members of Fleetwood Mac went their separate ways and didn't play together for several years.<br /><br />`Tango in the Night' was the band's 1987 come-back, originally planned by Lindsey Buckingham as a solo project. It marks a return to form, and was eventually FM's second-best selling album worldwide after `Rumours'.<br /><br />The strongest songs are from Buckingham and especially Christine MacVie, who wrote the best two of the album's four hit singles, `Everywhere' and `Little Lies'. Christine & Lindsey also co-wrote `Mystified', `Isn't it Midnight' and the album's excellent closer `You and I part 2'.<br /><br />Stevie Nicks' contributions to TitN are more modest, as due to a persistent and unresolved cocaine habit she didn't show up to the studio for most of the sessions. `Welcome to the Room, Sara' is one only two songs penned by her, themed on her experience in rehab.<br /><br />This is the final collection from the classic line-up of FM prior to the departure of Buckingham and Nicks for several years, and a fine album. Christine MacVie (after 30 years on the road) finally left the band, moved back to England and retired from the business, but the remaining foursome is still touring in 2013 and many classic numbers from TitN still grace their sell-out stage performances, as popular as ever.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My wife and I started watch season 3 and once again found the first 2 episodes to be very entertaining.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|If you ever wondered if there was compassion and caring in combat during WWII this will without a doubt prove it.
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|The acting was sophomoric and the storyline was ridiculous.. Watch this if there is nothing else to do and you need a mind numbing no brainer..
1453814388|5.0|We are a big reading family, going through 4 books at a time (one for car rides, one for after dinner, etc). We loved 'Pollyanna' so much, I ordered this one the day we finished Book 1. While one could argue whether book 1 or 2 is the best, it's a bit like arguing about the Godfather series (could the second one be as good as the first, without having seen part 1?).<br />The first 1/3 of the book starts with Pollyanna in about the same place as book 1 ends. Then it suddenly takes a HUGE leap and we meet up with 20 year old Pollyanna, who has to deal with grown-up issues: death in the family, financial issues, how romance can affect friendships, etc. She deals with them all gracefully and continues to use the Glad Game to improve her life and others around her.<br />All the characters we love from Book 1 are back again, each more grown up than before: Jimmy, Jamie, Sadie, Aunt Polly (she does get a bit morose in the sequel), Mr Pendleton and Nancy.<br />I love how Eleanore Porter was able to reconcile a grown-up Pollyanna and the Glad Game, not an easy feat. And I must admit, there were several moments that the storyline drove me a bit nuts, but it was because I was eager for resolution to the difficulties Pollyanna faced! While the ending was fairly predictable, I'm a sucker for a happy ending where all loose ends get tied up. Even in its predictability, Ms. Porter gives us a few surprises.<br />Only wish there was a third 'Pollyanna' book!
B00E0MCYPS|4.0|The game works flawlessly on the Verizon Samsung Galaxy S3 handset. There is different control schemes to choose from and they all work great.  Thank you dev for a very fun game. I love the replay feature. It just needs online multi player which is why I took off one star.
B001BANK32|5.0|Quality read. Keeps you riding on a suspenseful caravan. King is a master storyteller, and he never leaves you sitting down for long.
B008469DGY|4.0|This is a good game to waste time. Be advised, it is not a true golf game as you only make 1 shot per hole.
B00340LM8C|5.0|Very entertaining and enjoyable movie. Refreshing to watch a movie that does not  employ the vulgarity and gratuitous violence used in most current movies.
B009HEISJU|4.0|One of the best underrated sci-fi movie I have ever watch, the special effects was great also the storyline, The microwave gun concept was cool. I give the movie a 4 star rating, the only thing I didn't like about the movie was the ending, the writers should of added a little more excitement for a sequel, I would of like to see a part 2. Other movies I recommend...The fourth kind, intruders, they, Cowboys and aliens, Prometheus<br /><br />.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Absolutely fabulous show! The writing, the actors, the story line arr wonderful and the settings are beautiful! The only negative thing I could say would be is that there needs to be more episodes! I can't wait for the next season!
B00BIPCY14|4.0|Excellent writing. Excellent characters. Compelling drama. Clever humor. A great show... I'm hooked.<br /><br />I tire of one or two characters from time to time when they're made to be too aloof/cold repeatedly for too many episodes in a row. But there are enough engaging and intriguing characters and compelling courtroom cases in every episode to off-set the threat of disconnect. By the end of every episode, I'm hungry for the next one. The writing is smart and the cast is even smarter.<br /><br />I dearly miss Law and Order and this is one show that helps ease that void. The Good Wife is a winner.
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|Great addition to the series!!  A little weird seeing them as people but my daughter loves it. I definitely reccomend it.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I really enjoyed reading The Husband's Secret.  I read it in two sessions because I couldn't wait to find out what happened next.  Honestly, I had a little trouble keeping up with all the different characters/families but overall I really enjoyed the book.  I would recommend it to others as a good read.
B00A0NOF7G|5.0|Enjoyed it .  Characters l  would like to meet. Great mystery and who doesn't like cupcakes and doing something you enjoy doing.
B006S01GH2|5.0|Great movie.  Watched it a long time ago and always find myself watching every once in awhile.  Thoroughly enjoy the sense of humor.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I was overwhelmed by friends and family suggesting I read 50 Shades trilogy but when I read the reviews I heard the Sleeping Beauty trilogy was exceptionally better. My end result was reading both trilogies. I agree completely with the majority of the 50 Shades reviews and disagree completely with the majority of the Sleeping Beauty trilogy. Meaning 50 Shades was horrible and Sleeping Beauty was far from outstanding. The S&M might have been on point but the story plot and character development were disappointments. Save your money. I do not recommend either of these trilogies.
B00992CF6W|4.0|IT ISN'T REALLY UPDATED SO IT DOESN'T HAVE TO MANY THINGS :<br /><br />NO MULTIPLAYER<br /><br />NO MAGIC ( needed to go to neather)<br /><br />IT IS VERY HARD TO FIND DIMONDS so it's ok just not awesome =( .
B005HJU7HA|4.0|This collection has a lot of content, and the stories are very engaging. It's especially fun to contrast the stories with the BBC reboot of Sherlock.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|I love love love this soundtrack.  It totally destresses me while driving home from work.  The songs and music are so soothing and haunting.  I have a lump in my throat just typing this review.<br />If you buy it you will love it.
B00D6M86RS|5.0|Within the first 5 minutes of playing I was hooked. The only down side is you have to each table. But heh if you are a big marvel fan you will love this. The graphics are amazing! Well worth 99 cents.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Great show the entire family can watch! I can not wait until season 4 starts! hooked from the first episode
B002W7J3SO|5.0|They don't make 'em like they used to. Elegance, superb story-writing and suspence that'll have you on the edge of your seat without the need for lots of violence and special effects.
0679805273|5.0|I gave this as a graduation gift fora very dear friend of mine and it was a success<br />it is a pretty big size fora gift so i had a ton of fun finding boxes and bags to wrap it and make it fun
B00E0MCYPS|2.0|I played this game as Free App Of The Day and I can say I don't like it. Controls are very iffy. Hard to steer. The game runs ok. Graphics are pretty good. Uninstalled after first race...
B00EH6SK78|4.0|This is a good album. I was quite surprised to find that DevilDriver covered &#34;Sail&#34; by AWOLNATION. It is a pretty awesome cover.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Looking for a free app that's worthwhile? Well this one is totally fun! If your looking for something to relax to or just want something to pass time with. Give it at try.
B00EQRMAJW|5.0|Great voice. Great production. As an artist he continues to evolve and take chances that pay off big for his fans.
B008K6HN8I|3.0|ES File Explorer helped me play Animal Jam on my Kindle Fire HD. So, it's pretty bawesome sauce. Thank you very much.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This is an engaging well done movie.  Great entertainment value as well as educational.  Dispels the mystery to behaviors and thought patterns we all encounter.  Well dramatized biography
B000XA5K48|1.0|Sorry don't mean to be a snob, but intensely disliked this movie.<br /><br />Too much action at the expense of any semblance of a plot.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I like my guns, bullets and steel.  But I don't like the idea of 2 hours of over the top unbelievable stuff lacking any plot whatsoever.  Guns are guns and it's cool when the good guys need to be careful too.  Is it meant to make fun of stupid action movies?  Possibly, but it also doesn't really look any different than the movies it makes fun of.<br /><br />Now, I figure that lack of substance is precisely the point here, but that didn't make it any more enjoyable, to me.<br /><br />And noir, the more I see it in its modern incarnations, is not my thing.<br /><br />Past dislikes in similar movies:  Boondock Saints (which I hated even more), Hardboiled.<br /><br />Past likes on action movies:  Man on Fire, Die Hard, Dirty Harry, Scarface, Devil's Rejects (horror), Payback.<br /><br />Why the likes and dislikes?  Well, I ain't dissing Shoot Em Up just because I dislike violent movies in general.  I just hated this one and would have liked my 2 hours back.<br /><br />Your mileage may vary, to each her own ;-)
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I have enjoyed this game. The over all look and feel of the game is excellent. The only thing I wish they would change would be the added ability to make the hidden object screen ever bigger when you pinch the screen. These old eyes aren't what they used to be.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|Not the first novel I've read in which alien spaceships appear in earth's skies. However, I believe that this is the original and also the best. This is a really good read that keeps you guessing from beginning to end. Also a forerunner of the future of world government - perhaps UN leaders should read it as well.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Have heard about Dr Who for years and watched some of the older stuff and some was good and some was horrible.  This show is similar but it seems that the writing is a lot better. The characters are fun and I still like this doctor better than the other ones....  but I have a few episodes to go in the other seasons.<br /> If you are a science fiction fan, then you will like this ...  most likely.  If you are a deeply serious person or have never read books for pleasure ... or if you are not interested in shows that require you to use a bit of imagination, well, this will not be your thing.  Anyway, that's all for now... I think you will enjoy these first season shows!
B00BX50UEC|5.0|Can't wait for the annual Eurovision Song Contest.  All new music from mostly new (to me) artists.  Like opening a surprise package where every gift is good.
B005DJREJS|5.0|Loved this show! Witty and meaningful all at once. It's smart and addresses a lot of great issues. I loved it!
159463176X|5.0|As all of Hosseini's books, this one met all expectations. Outstanding protrayal of characters and life in Afghanistan's small villages and cities.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I only meant to play a single run and I ended up playing for a couple of hours. It is very addictive
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I, like many others I'm sure, think the original (with William Shatner and cast) would always reign, but this version with Chris Pine is well worth watching and equal to or better than the original. I'll watch Star Trek into Darkness many more times.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I am so addicted to this game I just wish you could earn energy instead of having to wait. It's very fun other than that
B009RX85N0|5.0|Arrived in stated time. Such a good series, glad to have the second season. Have just started watching it, and so far I am so pleased.
B008Y212PI|3.0|This is a fun game if you like these kinds of puzzles. It isn't the most difficult I've played but still fun
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I enjoy the graphics, gameplay mechanics, and the competitive aspect. It is a fun game for kids or adults in my opinion.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|This book is amazingly helpful I can see every word I needed to find you should get this book now
B000FBJAEG|4.0|Twist and turns everywhere. I am becoming a real fan of Mr. Baldacci. I couldn't put this book down now I Sam ready for the new king and Maxwell.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|Like the security feature.  Categories make it possible to limit the time it takes to find the file you need.
0143124544|1.0|I don't understand why this book has such great reviews.  I found it to be rather predictable.  What's worse, I thought all the characters lacked depth, especially Will.  The author just seemed to coast along the story line (which I could've guessed easily) without really making the reader understand and feel for the characters.  A big thumbs down from me!
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|This book was awesome! I love Jeff Kinney books. I dont know why Rodrick always picks on his brother like that.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game fun to play kills hours of time! !!! Hours if enjoy ment kids can play to for hours
B000FCK8ZK|4.0|TV show is better, in my opinion. However there is much better insight into how Dexter thinks, and how his &#34;Dark Passenger&#34; rules his life. It's very much like an addiction.
B008OOYALE|1.0|My five year old grandson didn't get it and it wasn't entertaining at all for him.  Looked like there was money involved all of the time.
B009E3EY38|5.0|This Blu-Ray captures what is perhaps the last live performance of the still-living members of the band. The performance was remarkably good and energetic given the age of the musicians and that they have been on the stage together only a few times since John Bonham died.  I feared that perhaps Jimmy Page was all washed up by now but his guitar skills proved to be still amazing.<br /><br />An annoyance with the Blu-Ray is that it defaults to stereo PCM sound.  Make sure to enable DTS playback if if your audio system is up to the task. Play it loud.
B00BWI3RTA|5.0|This is an amazing album.  Not as good as her first one which I think was the best but still really good. The only thing I don't understand is how this be a 2 disc album when all the tracks can fit on one CD.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This game has to be one of the most fun games ever made! I am 11 and I love Pudding Monsters. It works great on my Kindle Fire and my Kurio 4S. If you purchase this game, you will not regret it I promise! I hope my review was helpful!
B005GIS1WA|5.0|This is a cute movie the whole family can enjoy.  The soundtrack is addictive.  Loved it!  You can't help fall in love with the characters, this is one the kids will really enjoy.
B004GKMV16|5.0|Although it is a very long story I am finding it fascinating tracing the history of London from the very beginning of time. Not letting me get my work done!
B00DQR26EC|3.0|The game was a lot of fun to play. Nice graphics and easy controls.Even the story was interesting enough to pull you in.<br />The only thing that bugged me about this game was that on my Kindle Fire HD it would hang up and freeze quite often which was a little annoying.If it were not for that I would have given it 5 stars.
B0068MNO4S|5.0|This is the story of my long ago relations.  The argument that this man is the true Shakespeare makes so much sense when the facts are examined.
B0063GORYU|2.0|Would like this removed as I am not happy with clarity.  Preferred the original version my phone had and will be looking for another version
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Really like this game. It's fun but I haven't had to spend any money on it which is awesome! Patience is a good thing to have on this game but it's well worth it.
B000003TSP|5.0|One of my favorite all time albums. It's sexy, slow, and deep. I love Portishead. This album is my fav!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game was a fun challenge! While annoying at times, i would still recommend this game. i will be looking for more levels and similar games in the future.
B000WYCF6Q|5.0|On time, in new conditon,, as expected.  This mirror is small and magnifies and is useful for seeing cars in the distance before making a lane change.  It is not helpful or intended for fine detail.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|Let me first say that I'm not a big Tom Cruise fan generally.  Oblivion is a well told story with enough drama and action to satisfy most people.  The acting meets the quality of the screenplay.
B003U4UPHG|5.0|We are on our third time re-watching LOST from beginning to end. This time around I have seen things we never noticed before. I won't give it away. I just highly recommend it from the First season on. It's not your normal plane crash movie though. There are strange goings on, on this Island. If you don't mind a bit of sci-fi and fantasy thrown in to a Fantastic Drama, this show is for you! I suggest everyone give it a try. It's very thought provoking in which you'll be trying to figure<br />it all out. The characters and the actors who play them are just Terrific! The cast made this show so wonderful to be a part of. Hope you love it as much as we do.
B00129H7VS|5.0|Great series.  Loved how actual interviews with veterans were used to launch each episode.  This really provided an accurate historical perspective.
B00992CF6W|2.0|next update mineshafts ; redstone ore bug fix; flint and steel creative;wolf's;enchantments ; PUMPKINS; emerald ore;villages ;redstone; JUNGLES; nice work mojang!!
B0028KF4ME|5.0|Simply put, I'm a Dexter fan. Every season is very good. The one running series on pay cable channels (HBO/Showtime) that lasted for 8 years and is still interesting.
B007N8RULO|5.0|This  game plays like my large desk top PC  version but can play anywhere with out the big hardware and screen.
B0027I93U6|5.0|After season 1, I wasn't sure where I stood with this series in terms of \\"great\\", \\"very good\\" or just \\"good\\". But season 2 kept me hanging in there.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|This is an Awesome love story. Leonardo DiCaprio is such a great actor.  I enjoyed the costumes and the parties,  and the sound track is great too.  I'm really thinking about purchasing this movie.  I think I can say with absolute confidence that this was as good as the Note Book!
B005D643PO|5.0|Simply put, I'm a Dexter fan. Must watch series. The 4th season was a tough one to follow but nonetheless, this was successful.
B008MM9630|5.0|My granddaughter and I play together she loves it. Very nice music and the character is cute. Colorful enough to keep a child's attention.
B002QNEJT2|5.0|BEST season ever for Dexter and I've watched all (while reviewing this, the 8th season is ongoing). HUGE shocker of a season. That's all I have to say but, it is not to be missed. Make sure you catch the first 3 seasons before watching this one. I was floored!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Lots of fun for grown up children over 65 yrs.  Helps out when the tv shuts off,  helps you wait for mealtime & keeps your hands out of the potato chip bag.
B008IYSMLY|5.0|Season 6 could have been better as the story had more potential than what was revealed but, that is not to say I didn't enjoy it immensely. Must watch.
0307593312|1.0|I'm in wholehearted agreement with the most recent reviewer, who suggested that this was agonizing to get through. Some books I find boring or fluffy, some I love and zip through; most fall somewhere in between and most I read through to the end -- but not this one. Because of the numerous positive reviews, I persisted in reading this until the three-quarter mark and then finally gave up because I realized that it was not going to get any better and I just could not stand the book for another second.  It had an interesting premise that never went anywhere, and the Little People and their \\"Ho Ho Hos\\" were so annoying I wanted to squish them flat!  This book must be for fans of Murakami; having never read any of his work before, I can say that I am not in the slightest bit tempted to read another of his books.
B002ELIXCA|5.0|I had to see what all the fuss was about in reference to this series. Season 1 was very good but I wasn't sure if I would have classified it along the same level of fame with HBO's \\"Sopranos\\". But I obviously I enjoyed it because, I continued to watch the rest of the series and am now currently watching and enjoying season 8.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Neat story but very predictable. It was enjoyable. I would recommend this for an easy read where you don't have to think.
B00E5Q1HJS|3.0|Could have been better. Love the actors and the \\"youth\\" movement on the Trek community. Great special affects.  But the story was just average and quite predictable.
B004LROUNG|5.0|John Grisham is one of my favorite authors and this book shows he only gets better with age. It's one of those &#34;you can't put it down&#34; books that I can re-read many times.
B00AC8ZJ6K|4.0|I am very critical of most movies.  I didn't find anything to annoy me in this movie.  It was entertaining, easy to watch, and devoid of the typical nonsense. . . Nothing spectacular to recommend it.  Just pleasant to watch.
1936608898|5.0|Years of trying the latest fad diets, ending with weight watchers which didn't work for me and I had sworn off anything other than balanced earrings....whole grains, fruits, veggies...to no avail.<br />My blood sugar fasting was averaging 115-120, pre diabetic, and abdominal fat was increasing.<br />I found the Whole 9 website which led me to this book and way of eating. Organic meat, veggies, and healthy fats. No gluten, dairy, alcohol, processed foods, sugar...see what happens to the body.<br />I am doing the Whole 30 clean eating. At day 14, fasting blood sugar was 83...and has been there since. I'm on day 20, have lost 11 pounds, and more importantly the fat is beginning to burn off, energy has increased, and I am satiated between 3 healthy meals a day. No points, no counting...just healthy foods and portions. I highly recommend the book...and then taking the action to see what it might do for you.
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|Great game, the best airplane simulator ever. It is the funniest game I have ever played. If you don't download it you're missing out.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|My husband and I have watched this movie dozens of times!!  We love, love, love it!!! Captain America is a real American hero who starts off as a tiny 'lil man who is 'transformed' into a super hero. The world is a better place for having him in it. There is also a sweet love story here, just enough to tough the female audience!  Top notch movie!!  A++
B003B96AOW|5.0|This action figure is complete with beautiful dark colors with a hint of an airbrush finish. The detail in the figure and weapons are just Amazing! I recommend this to a die hard Deadpool fan!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Excellent. I anxiously await the last one in the trilogy.Well developed characters build a credible story within the historical backdrop.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|Watched this concert on PBS a few months ago, and again a few weeks ago. Had to have the cd. This double cd is one of my absolute favorites. Soulful-bluesy songs with really unusual instruments. Love it love it love it!
B003O86FMW|4.0|I don't read a lot of books but this was kept me wanting to keep reading. A great read. a+
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I bought this for my nieces, but quickly found it enjoyable as well.  Sadly, I even told my nieces to wait and let Auntie finish her turn.  Hey, it's my Kindle!
B000NY12LO|5.0|A look inside a school shooting....a tragedy, and inside a social hierarchy and its cruelty to those not allowed to fit in.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|love it. great way to connect with friends. fun to play. amazing. awesome. nothing else to say.<br />ugh really. I'm done now.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Great story exposing how imbalances in a relationship can have disastrous effects. Whether imbalance occurs due to a bigger than life personality or a personality overshadowed by a secret of deep shame, the result can be surprising or shocking to all.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This is a good game, but if you do not have facebook it is very hard to advance.  It seems that Hinton is sopposed to be a \\"group \\" activity.
B005LCECU6|5.0|Considering that these concerts took place when I was only just taking my first breaths, it's hard to listen to this album (cd) without the knowledge of the legacy that Rush have given us over the years influencing my judgement.  What I wouldn't give to have heard my first Rush song coming through radio back then or even better, seeing them live in 1974/5.  Generally being a listener of music beyond my years I can only remember &#34;Panama&#34; by Van Halen and &#34;Welcome To The Jungle&#34; from Guns 'n' Roses striking a chord with me and turning me on to new sounds at a young age.  I'm sure hearing &#34;Working Man&#34; for the first time would've stirred me in a similar way.  Hearing that song here in an early, raw live incarnation leaves me desperately wishing I could've seen these bands, with Rush at or near the top of the list, making their way back then.  No, the sound isn't the greatest or clearest you'll ever hear but for me that's part of the pleasure.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|Film looks to be set in near future (no high-tech weapons or gadgets) and almost entire movie was filmed in a 200 story slum building. Basically, Dredd & rookie go in on a simple call and end up in lock-down battling through thugs, gang members, and other judges. Halfway through the movie I started skipping ahead 5 minutes at a time just to find myself re-watching the same thing. Couple guys come in, they get killed, some struggle happens w/ main characters, then they move on. Bad guy dies, good guys win. I was hoping for a good movie & got an okay one. Glad I didn't pay to see it or even rent it.<br />If you're looking for a remake of Stallone's Dredd movie, this is not it. Only consistency between the two movies is the female counterpart & Dredd's character himself. I'm a bigger fan of the Stallone version, although it is a bit more campy, it was better made. This film would be good for background noise or just to half-watch while you're falling asleep.
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|This was a sad season with two main characters dying. I hope season four can keep the characters alive to go through all the trials and tribulations.
B0040I09RM|4.0|I lived in nor cal and new some people like what this mc is supposed to be. It is not much like the way they are in real life, so it is actually entertaining.
B00C28J2VQ|4.0|Bought for my husband and he really liked it as much as the 1st one. he said the 3d was very good.
1451695195|4.0|Interesting in light of other such books because his experience was quite different.  I think maybe because he was not a believer.  But as my son said, &#34; it is only proof to him because he experienced it but is not proof to any reader&#34; so maybe the title should be changed a bit.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I now have a new favorite author. A wonder read! Read it on vacation and couldn't put it down til I finished, and then wished I'd stretched it out!
0894803123|5.0|The recipes are easy to use and most of the ingredients are common grocery store finds.  We are working our way through the book and have not made a &#34;bad&#34; ice cream yet.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Let me begin by stating what this book is NOT before I state what it IS.<br /><br />It is not some ground-breaking body of scientific evidence of the divine. You will not find pages and pages of physical manifestations of God or any 100% conclusive proof that the afterlife exists. If that is what you are hoping to get from this book, you will be sorely disappointed. (And don't you think if that's what this book offered, it would be far more widely read?)<br /><br />Just as in any matters of faith, if you believe, you believe; if you don't, you don't. Those who want to discount Alexander's claims will find ways to do so, and those that approach this book with an open mind can read his story and judge for themselves.<br /><br />Eben Alexander is a neurosurgeon who, before catastrophic illness took place, was a Christian in name only. He attended church with family on occasion, and never officially labeled himself an atheist or even an agnostic, but he did not truly believe in God. Alexander comes to us, his readers, as a man who had every reason to doubt his own senses, which makes his message all the more compelling.<br /><br />He suffered from an extremely rare form of meningitis which ultimately put him in a coma for seven days. The fact that he is alive is incredible enough, but the way he has completely regained all of his physical and mental faculties and his memories is the true miracle. The brain-eating bacteria should have rendered him a vegetable. Instead, he came out of the coma 100% healthy.<br /><br />During his coma, Alexander had what we call a \\"near death experience,\\" or NDE. This book is his journey into the afterlife and what he experienced there. Throughout the book, he also details his medical reports and explains why he firmly believes his experience was real (or \\"ultrareal,\\" as he puts it) from a scientific standpoint. (For example, reasons why what he experienced couldn't simply be hallucinations.)<br /><br />I enjoyed this book and found it fascinating. I think it is a great read for anyone who believes in the afterlife or is questioning. It is always good to have perspectives besides our own, especially when it concerns spirituality.
B007R0XF3U|5.0|What a performance - going back in time and knowing she is talented, what an artist! I do recommend watching.
1609611543|4.0|Taking wheat out of my diet did help me get past a plateau I had hit, but it is scary.  He believes in good fats, coconut oil, butter without additives.  We'll see what my chlosterol does

B00CL8D83U|3.0|Wasn't anything special to write home to mother about.  Sad too cuz I'm a big fan since before they were widely known.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I purchased this on a kindle sale, and am I ever glad I did!! I'm even considering purchasing an actual physical version of this book to keep on my shelf! The story has so many twists and turns, it just sucks you right in! The ending was quite fast... and left me wanting more! I can't wait until the next book in the series!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Nice solitaire game. but the pop ups between games are very annoying.<br />Wish there was a way to reduce or limit the pop ups.
0525953728|4.0|Only reason i did not give this book a 5 was because there are better books out there to read. This book was a great read and was interesting from cover to cover however i did enjoy reading Roberts Ridge, Lone Survivor, and American Sniper more than this book. This book would probably of been my number 1 if i was to have read it first however i read it after reading many other war stories prior so it just kind of blended in VS sticking out to me like Lone Surivor did. Not sure but definatly worth the time to read and guartantee you will enjoy it. As an active duty military member the coolest thing about this book was the &#34;good idea fairy&#34; they had to put up with like we do everyday. It never ends as well as that it was extremely cool learning about how much funding they get for KITS, weapons, and the extent they went into building a MOCK house of Bin Laden.
B007HVBW2A|4.0|Instant streaming with prime. Good to see that some quality movies are available for instant view (unlike Netflix).  Can't wait to see what else is there
0871137380|3.0|Was very excited to read the book due to movies HOLLYWOODING films up and getting off track from what the true story is. However; this was not the case and the movie covered every single aspect and interesting thing that the book mentioned. Really wanted to learn something new and different from the book and the movie but, was greatly disappointed. Would recommend you reading up on the snipers whom inserted as the only rescue team because their story was not portrayed in the movie or book as well as some of the after action reports were.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I spend so much time on here. From diy projects, gardening tips, recipes, art, quotes, fashion, make-up and everything in between! It's so helpful in all aspects in life!!!!
0062082353|5.0|Must read to believe. Chris Kyle had an amazing life and even better career. It is a shame to what has happened to him after this book was published but makes it that much more worth reading. All current &#34;snipers&#34; like myself and military members should read this book to motivate and refocus our goals and aspriations.

B008P1EWIM|5.0|This is  a really good app, it has a lot of good features like knowing how fast the wind speed is. Pretty useless information if you ask me, but it's so cool that I know these kinds of things
B00CEQ1JOO|5.0|This doll is a good toy to add in your monster high collection or any toy collection she comes with a pet rabbit called Dustin and it is a cute name because it is a dust bunny and a special detail was added her eyes can glow if you put her in direct sunlight for 30 seconds then put her in a very dark room and watch it glow she is the same size as how keen that means that she is smaller than the grown ups like franke and lagoona ect. Other accessories include a three piece stand and a black hair comb don't for get the diary filled with private happenings about Twyla's daily life thanks for looking but I don't really recommend buying her for 20.00 or over because she's in every shopping toy store !
B000P6PVLC|5.0|Seven years after its release with nearly 600 reviews and the average rating is 3 stars?  Really?  Have you been to the movies lately?  Lame, stale, uninventive, CG instead of intelligence.  Babel may not be the perfect movie, but it is riveting, intelligent, inventive, superbly acted, directed, and filmed.  And it really sticks in your mind.  A truly interesting film.  I would call this one of the 100 films released after 2000 not to miss.  Any serious fan of film has to have this film in their repertory.
0985557834|5.0|J D Lenzen is not the new Ashley but he's a breath of fresh air.  I have over 48 books on knots and don't buy new books much anymore but I've bought all three of J D's books.  New knots, new materials, what's not to like.  The illustrations are clear, easy to follow, and beautiful to look at.  Great set of books about knots.
B009B1UZ7C|5.0|I first saw him on &#34;Last Call w/Carson Daly&#34;. I love his style and &#34;catchy&#34; toons.  I also love to hear him talk.... (He had a humorous response to a comment Carson made regarding Taylor Swift and young contemporary song and dance talent in general).  I'm sure we haven't heard the last of Jake Bugg.
0061714402|5.0|For those of us who were lucky enough to witness the birth of metal/thrash metal in the early eighties and are interested in the lore of the Mustaine/Megadeth/Metallica relationship, this book is for you. I mention three entities because I believe that even though Megadeth is Mustaine's band, a vehicle for Mustaine's fiery restlessness, he is on his own is quite unique. Unfortunately once again we see the effects of a broken home, and the deep scars that result. It makes me appreciate my parents and reinforces my commitment to be a responsible parent. I believe that poor parenting will be the downfall of the American civilization, but that's another story! Back to the eighties, you know the big rock shows in smoky arenas, \\"To feel the warm thrill of confusion - That space cadet glow.\\" Mustaine could have easily trashed Metallica and any of the other people he has encountered on his journey, but he has not. Instead we get the honest to god truth, with him acknowledging his own weakness and downfalls. Who would not be devastated, kicked out of undeniablely thrash metal's biggest and most successful band. But if that never happened, Megadeth would never be. One might be quick to choose sides here, but you really have to understand all of these guy's were caught in the explosion of the thrash metal scene. They were young and impressionable, like we all were, you really do not gain perspective and wisdom until later in life. So the way things went, in retrospect it makes sense. Metallica and Megadeth are both great bands. Mustaine is still alive. The weed in California must really suck because everyone seems to be dancing with Mr. Brownstone.
B007HACDLK|5.0|The last novel by a great writer ! Vince passed away about 2 months ago. My heartfelt sympathy goes out to his wife and children. If you have not had the pleasure of reading his other books they were all good and you will enjoy them. My favorite was the take over of the White House by terrorist. Sorry I don't remember the title but if you are interested you will find it when you read about the book on Amazon.
B00AYB1RGG|1.0|With the problems of shootings in schools and public places, Hollywood needs to stop producing movies that glorifies and promotes violence and drug use. This movie does all that and I know there are people who revel in it. My review will probably even draw them to it. I feel disappointment for those who are. If you're reading this, do you really want to fill your memory with scenes that will haunt you for the rest of your life?
B006GKHE6G|5.0|Great game. When will Riptide 2 be available for the Kindle? It is already released on Ipad. It looks like a big improvement over Riptide1.

0634089358|5.0|Lots of cool bits in this book. Walking lines, turnarounds, intros, endings. There's a number of standards that get called at every blues jam that are transcribed in the book. Accurate transcriptions. Both Tab and Standard notation with chord symbols shown above.

B004SIIBGU|5.0|It makes it super easy yo navigate in and out of ebay. Simple to use for buying and selling and just viewing.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Great movie.  Lots of twists!  We thought we had it figured out until the very end.  Full of suspense and action.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|A story that intertwines fictional families over true events and people during the epic period of World War II makes it exciting to turn to the next page.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|boring.  a sleeper.  Couldn't watch it all the way through.  Don't bother getting this one unless you need a sleeping aid.
B000VOC90Y|4.0|This is a great backpack for carrying large laptops and cushions it well while still having lots of room for school books and anything else.  I realize that this backpack is made for 17&#34; laptops but not only is mine a 17.3&#34;; it has a pretty hefty aluminum body that is difficult to properly fit in many other cases or backpacks.  Only downside is that (and this may just be because of the heft of my laptop) when carrying it full with a few books and the laptop the straps become a bit uncomfortable after a long day (I typically walk about 9-15  miles a day at college, minimum 7).
B0040I09RM|5.0|Sons of Anarchy is very engaging show once you get past the excessive violence and the fact that they are performing illegal activities.  Characters are well developed and you get a sense of both good and bad in them as in normally present in all of us.  The show is decieving in a way, you tend to like the main characters even though they are criminals.  Hoever, the Sons have a family code and take care of their own, which is to be admired.  Maybe, brutally honest would be a good description?  For most of us, little exposed to corruption and behind the senes politics, the show is revealing.
0316247545|5.0|SO GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! VERY INFORMATIVE!!!!!!!!!!!!! PRACTICLY PERFECT!!!!!!!!!!!!The only bad thing is the episode despriction thing for  each episode, didm't really love that.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|It's a tiny bit bad but only from lack of guns obviously they will add more so still really awesome app plz add cool guns LOVE this app I would definitely recommend it
B00CPTUNBK|4.0|As a long time Brony i was doubtful hearing about this movie and setting. I will be honest when I say I thought it was going to be utterly terrible. And while I can't say it's 24 Carat gold, I will say that it far exceed my expectations.<br /><br />Plot: Arguably the weakest part of the story in my opinion. While on a visit to the Crystal Empire, newly crowned Princess Twilight has her crown/Element of Harmony stolen by a strange mare and taken to another world. To retrieve it she must travel to this other reality and face the challenge that awaits...<br /><br />High School.<br /><br />This was where I thought the movie was going to crash and burn. I expected something about all the trials and troubles of high school and how with good friends you can get through them and stuff like that which I have seen a million times before. To be far while there is a hint of that, it's not the general 'thrust' of the story. The message seems to be more about finding ways to accept everyone and how everyone can pull together with a common goal in mind. This is rushed and along with the villains plot it all feels a bit too much shoved together with underdeveloped plot lines that do little or go nowhere. This is perhaps because the time limit Twilight has is just three days. If it were a full week (and the movie had been two hours or more) there would have been time to explore these plots more thoroughly.<br /><br />Characters: With the exception of one new villain all the characters are really the same as those from the show, just taking on slightly different roles. In that sense it's enlightening to see how these individuals can be just as interesting as humans as they are being ponies. Pinkies antics in particular were quite amusing, as always.<br /><br />Music: This was the biggest selling point for me after watching the movie. Some might call the music generic pop or rock, but I found most of it it quite enjoyable if a bit easy to forget with the exception of one or two songs.Still overall the soundtrack was great and I am personally hoping for a collection of music from this and and the show to be released soon.<br /><br />Moral/Lesson: Like in the show there is a lesson to be learned from Twilights adventures. I don't want to spoil it for those that haven't seen it, but the general message seems to be that a leader is one who can inspire by standing /with/ those they care about. The writers have said the movie is canon at least in so far as that this was teaching Twilight how to be a leader. She had leadership qualities in the show, but she only had to manage five close friends. This was about inspiring individuals she knew almost nothing about and bringing them together with a common goal. Even if it doesn't seem all that strong it's a good message all the same I believe.<br /><br />Final Analysis: The movie is far from perfect. Focusing on the plot too much gives the whole thing a faintly rushed and underdeveloped tone. On the other hand, if you can turn your brain off and not ask questions too much about the 'why' and 'how' of things that are happening it still can be quite the enjoyable experience.
B0068857QA|5.0|I watched this when it came out on HBO and bought it for a short Airplane trip I was going on. I watched it on my Kindle Fire and was great quality. Just make sure if you are watching on the plane that you have headphones on because there is a lot of gunshots and explosions.
1781162646|5.0|I have always been a huge fan of Stephen King and this book is just as captivating as all of the books I've read previously! He tells the kind of story that you can't put the book down as I want to know what happens next! The fact that it's an old amusement Park setting makes it even more intriguing to me. Loved it!
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Found this movie to be pretty interesting with many unexpected events.  Nice action and good story line.  A attention getter for sure.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Great TV in a beautiful setting. Wonderful visually. And not a bad story to boot. Love that amazon video available across devices, too.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Not only is it a classic, but my son four year old loved reading the the Wizard of Oz before bedtime. And, it is public domain, so the price is right!

B004TI5N38|4.0|Classic David Baldacci book, hard to put down, you won't be dissapointed reading this book. This book is a great read and will keep you guessing until the end.
B005HGKWLO|1.0|5 of the most disgusting characters in movie history compete to see who can be the worst human being. In the end the only thing I was rooting for was for all of them to catch a communicable disease.<br /><br />Watch as the star of Once Upon a Time betrays her childhood friend to steal her fiancé, who seems determined to string both women along for all eternity. They rationalize the affair by making one of Hollywood's most likable stars the most horrible woman possible - a lying, cheating, arrogant, self centered, vapid sociopath. She has an affair with her fiancé's friend, who the movie sets up as a foul mouthed, but otherwise good natured dude. Hilarity and pregnancy ensue.<br /><br />The guy from The Office also stars as the girls' childhood friend. His only purpose seems to be to encourage one friend to betray the other, while participating in a running gag where he avoids sleeping with the 3rd girl in the group because she is 2.7 pounds overweight and is not a horrible enough person.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|it is kind of a dirty book but not realy. If you are sensative forget it. A lot of people seem to be reading it
B00CL6HGIK|2.0|I felt like a confused old man the entire movie, hoping it would all click eventually. After about an hour and a half, my confusion turned to frustration, and the pay off was a very 'meh' ending. Great cast, pretty good acting, except Wahlberg and Crowes accents. And Zeta-Jones character being pointless. And Barry Pepper's gay for his campaign manager? Ah, screw the cast, it sucked. Waste of time, my lady friend came over and she chose this to spend our evening together. Almost dumped her.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|I'm a fan of both the HBO series and the book. Saw the show first, so that perphas helped me in keeping the multitude of characters straight in my head. Never bothers me when there are differences between a book and a screen adaptation. If anything, it gives an interesting difference of interpretation to think about.
B006QF61VA|5.0|Well done movie.  Great intro to Vietnam issues and conversation starter with kid.  Williams is funny and tragic.  History lite.

B00CPTUN5G|5.0|Awesome movie, with a great story and a lot of really funny references, plus some great songs.  I know a lot of bronies didn't like it but personally i loved it as a MLP movie.
B00AEFY6ZQ|4.0|Love this movie! The animal captures were amazing. I understand that the actors did most of the animal handling. Love the elephants and song.
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|It would be five star if you did not need to spend money to play. I won't play it as often because it cost money.
B0094K1WZE|1.0|Very predictable and too much computer generation. Weak story and too much Tom Cruise. The middle of the movie was just dull.

B004AKCMD4|4.0|It is a really great story that shows how easily people turn on each other when power is at hand
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Loved it. A touching story about a dog and his love for his family. Some parts were cry worthy, but not because they were super sad, just tragic.
B00D6M86RS|5.0|Really enjoyed playing with my son's.What an excellent challenge.  Really a lot of fun.  Can get caught up in it very easy.
B0093H8HXS|5.0|I bought this CPU for my first build ever and man does it do work. When coupled with my HD 7850 graphics card I could run games like never before on higher settings and with smoother frame-rates. I am very happy with it because it was so much better than what I had before in my old desktop. (AMD Athlon X2 250) Simply a great product that is a work horse and will make your comp feel like your own personal gaming machine. Or whatever machine you want it to be. A processor that is fast and affordable, you can't go wrong.
B004LWZW42|4.0|a pretty good movie but not fantastic as the other xmen movies i like nick hoult and james mcavoy ok
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Just when you think you can't like another set of Star trek characters. They again come up with a combination of actors and actresses that deliver above and beyond.  I really hope this cast makes a third movie.
0143119680|4.0|this book has too many details and not enough of a love story which is really between the lines ok
B008EZVNFE|4.0|The British singer Lianne has such a beautiful, silky voice. Very special and for me hard to compare to anyone else. It took me 2 to 3 times listening before I really liked the CD. It's not everyone's taste. Actually it takes me back to the beginning of the 70th. Very nice lyrics! Almost like poetry.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|this is a great movie mathew mcfayden is awesome and it is so romantic i have watched this movie several times

B0067Q42BY|4.0|It's fun...if a little throwing when you switch to a new area and it's sink or swim as you learn to match new tiles...and I swear it seems like each location gets harder and harder. &#62;.&#60; Anyway, it is certainly enjoyable if you like a challenge, though I wish the little comic in between games made more sense. Sure, I get the point, but...it's barely good story telling.
B008220BLG|5.0|i love this movie if you like the twilight movies then you will love this movie more of a love story than a zombie story

B004XANKVO|4.0|I travel a lot and rely on my backpack to carry a lot. I've been through a lot of backpacks over the years and this one is holding up nicely. It can hold a 17 inch MACBook Pro, iPad, and various other pieces of equipment and clothes if need be. You get what you pay for and this good example of that.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|Great movie! Definitely buy this if you love action packed movies. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's got great acting and really captures the personalities of the different characters.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love love love this show! If you like period pieces or shows about the class system then this is for you!!! Historical events set up this show and dwells deep to show how they effect the upstairs aristocratic family and the downstairs servants who wait on them.

B001L63JC8|5.0|I enjoyed this when it first came out, an engaging concept album, one of Genesis' last albums with Peter Gabriel. It brought back many pleasant memories to listen to it again. And again. And again.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Just go ahead and order it, arrived 9/6 I ordered it on 7/26 way too long to wait but that is not the products fault.<br />Anyway, nice simple packaging, simple instructions, easy set up. (unless you are a moron, which I suspect most of the one star people are.)<br />Works nicely with Netflix, watched two entire TV shows, controlled one from a Galaxy S3, the other from a laptop.<br />Watched a little steaming from a chrome tab, quality had to be turned down to get it to work right but it worked OK.<br />Netflix worked.<br />You Tube worked.<br />Google Play Movies worked.<br />Google play Music Worked.<br />That what I was promised, that is what I got. What more can you ask?
B008602KQI|5.0|I usually think that movies made from books rather than screenplays are not as well done, but this was a very good adaptation of the book.  I would recommend it.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|It does not work.  We cannot set the windmill down anywhere.  My granddaughter spent 20 frustrating minutes trying to play the game.
B00BSBUZT6|1.0|These are great discs, and best of all is the concert disc. I'd give it 5 Points, if it did not have a Code A Encoding. Since the European blu ray buyer does not get the complete set with the concert disc, it is  noch understandlble why there shoud be  a fixed code A. The DVD Edition with compressed surround Sound does not make up for it. Sorry to rate this Grand item so low.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|Can you get any better than a romance that has stood the test of time and still has a relevant feel over 200 years later?  Absolutely not!  I love reading this any time my life gets too hectic because I know it will draw me into a more simple time, and put perspective on everything around me.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is a much better story than his second book. I was hesitant to purchase this but it delivered a powerful tale about one family and the lives it intertwined with giving the reader one last gasping revelation in the end.
B008Y73IV4|5.0|U like Danny mcbride then this is for u !!!! A must see for all , funny , action , over the top cheese .
B002UM5BXW|4.0|Bourdain tells an interesting, and sometimes humorous story about how he got started in the business.  This was enjoyable to read.  The rest of the story flowed, and who doesn't like to talk about and think about good food?
1449433251|4.0|I simply love Calvin and Hobbes (got 5 tattoos of them).<br /><br />If you are reading this review, it's probably uselles to describe the cartoon itself. So I'll review the this collection instead.<br /><br />High-quality paper, colored sunday strips, comes in a nice, protective box.<br /><br />However, they could come in hard covers, and I really missed some extra information or bonus materials. There are 3 or 4 pages introducing the material, but that doesn't add much.
B0039O8AQK|5.0|The novel was written in the 1940's and Orwell accurately predicted our world today. To watch this movie and see what our government has done to take away our constitutional rights for &#34;the good of the people&#34; and do it with technology is very frightening. Read the book if you haven't and realize we could all be Winston Smith. Think of Richard Burton's character as a fatherly and caring US federal official looking out for the welfare of society.<br /><br />&#34;If you want to imagine the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face forever.&#34;<br /> - George Orwell
B000KUD2G4|5.0|My guitar gear used to make a lot of noise, especially because the electric system in Brazil is not grounded.<br /><br />I decided to purchase a couple of these beauties and it really did its job!<br /><br />Main features:<br /><br />- very, very light (feels like there's nothing inside it)<br />- very, very small (same size, if not smaller, than a regular pedal)<br />- does not require a power supply<br /><br />Today, I'm going to try it with my ear monitor system.<br /><br />Definitely recommend it for all and any types of gears.
B009NX61JY|5.0|One of my all time favorites! Barbra at her best! A romantic comedy that melts your heart.  A home run!
B007712XAU|5.0|Loved it! Also bought Season 3 and can't wait to see and then purchase Season 4. The costumes and setting are outstanding.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is really awesome! it challenges my mind a lot...i always play it before bed so my brain gets tired :)
B00ESY77LO|3.0|It was fair.  A lot of hype but I did get a free credit from Amazon after watching it.  Also, it was 2 and half hours long..... too long.
B001AMNL2Q|5.0|One of the best Viet-Nam era movies out. The basic training sequence is very accurate as to the actual training to our marines. The combat scenes are very graphic and the interaction between the men is also very realistic. I have watched it numerous times and it never gets old.
B009R659L8|5.0|I have read all of her books and also her daughter's and I can't put them down until I've read them cover to cover!
B00021R7CG|5.0|Great storyline. The visuals are good and characters are also good. Very impelling movie, you wont want to miss a second of it. This was broadcast by HBO many years ago and I always wanted to see it again.
B0099RFVXQ|2.0|I'm waiting for someone soon to make an original sci fi that has something to say besides making noise so the audience can rejoice over a glorified shoot em up techi western!
B0039O8AQK|5.0|This movie  has a great story to it as to what could be should another power takes over. It is dark, sad, distroughting, but a great movie that will keep you watching.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Helps to pass the time while standing in line at the store or waiting on someone you're playing taxi for. :-)<br />Should have been free, tho. It is on other devices.
B00DHHWYAW|3.0|A visually spectacular feast for the eyes but lacking too many of the most important aspects of the book. In fact the CGI is so spectacular that the human actors, despite the dramatic story line, just seem like props that have been dropped haplessly into this glitzy, CGI infused extravaganza. The wild parties are a sight to behold but the story takes a back seat to the glamour, glitz, and ultimately garish visuals. Here Luhrmann shows himself once again to be the master showman as the movie is still entertaining to watch but in the final cut doesn't do justice to the power and complexity of the original story.
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|Fun game so far! So far have not had to pay for coins!  When it comes to that I will quit.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|It's fun, just wish they gave more energy.<br />I also wish I did not have to write such a long review. Lol
B005DJREGQ|2.0|I would not watch it with my kids.  It is too raunchy for my taste.  Prefer shows like In the Middle.
B007RQ6WCA|3.0|Glad it was free because I'm not sure it will be as useful as I thought it would when I read its description.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|You Version Bible app gives access to many translations at a moments notice. The programs they provide allow you to keep up on bible studies, verses of the day where ever Internet service is available. This is helpful to me when I'm working out of town. Thank you!
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|Just keep on playing it. Have to force myself to put it down. Sooo many levels and options! Totally worth it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Amazing. I could barely put it down. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good read.  The best I have read in a while
B005XQLBU4|2.0|Was promised 50 points for rating the app. Didn't get my points. So new rating with less stars. Don't lie to me.
B00ECU2RGY|2.0|Oblivion was oblivious!  Excellent acting, poor script.  The stars wasted their talent, time and energy. Hollywood reaped dust when reaching for the stars.
B00026WU64|5.0|Classic; none like it. The foundation of the sixties, but don't tell Bob!<br /><br />Great Music, arrived fast, as described.<br />Happy!
B008YKGQR4|1.0|This a'pp does not work on my  polaroid tablet.  Current version is no longèr supported ? Very unhappy customer right now<br /><br />I am not sure how to proceed.
B00C2C637I|4.0|A story that has stood the test of time, by a master writer also proven to be among the greats.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Excellent read!!! I love this story. And the kove triangles that happen!!! Cass has a great story in these books!
B0049U4NQO|5.0|I personally think that this is th best book in the series. I was sad when jack died it was something i never would have guessed would happen
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Thought I was going to be the cool kid by being the first on my block to get the new Google Chromecast. Was all excited with my new gadget when it came in the mail yesterday. Installed it and got it running today, only to find out that one of the main features, streaming from your Chrome browser to your TV, is not yet supported on Android devices!! The browser plug-in for Chrome is supported on Mac, Linux, and Windows, but not Android!! WTF? Its made by Google for god's sake!! Why would they release the hardware without having one of its main features supported on Google's main platform.  Especially considering it has already been on the market for 2 months this should not be an issue. The whole point of the thing is to stream from your device to your TV!!! Epic fail Google!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great game.  It's got all the right components, and I like being able to change the deck.  Nice feature of larger faces on the cards, too.
B00CTESTA8|5.0|good plot lines an a lot of comedy mixed in to this show. hot babes good looking men my wife says
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Best book ever!! I can't believe how well this book is written! Warning if you start this series you will never get out
0553386816|4.0|are just as gripping and entertaining as his books, just a lot shorter.  Definitely worth the read if you're a Grisham fan.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Honestly it was the best series I have read do far and can't wait for the third to come out!
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Great app at a great a great price. Nothing bad to say. User friendly and accurate. Would definitely recommend it.
B006TKP2B2|5.0|It is completely baffling to see all the negative reviews this book has received. This probably says more about science-fiction readers than it says about the book. I mean, when you give this book 3 stars or less, and you do read sci-fi, then I assume that there must exist sci-fi books that you would rate higher than the Windup Girl. Which are those books?<br /><br />Personally, I would rank The Windup Girl on level with classics such as Brave New World and 1984. Its vision of the future is equally credible, dystopic and detailed. Indeed, the level of detail in this book is pretty much unsurpassed. Bacigalupi has so many ideas, and this alone makes the book worth reading.<br /><br />Other sci-fi authors, ranging from Ian Banks to the Kollin brothers, also have lots of ideas, and it makes their books worth reading as well. Bacigalupi stands out because of two reasons. First, his ideas are more credible. Who cares that the concept of a kink-spring isn't fully explained? We can all understand the basic idea to some extent, and it is a credible invention in a post-oil future. Second, Bacigalupi writes much, much better than any other sci-fi author currently alive that I know about. He writes in present tense, and this may put some readers off, but there are good reasons for it. OK, there are limitations to what I have read, but I can recognize good literature when I read it.<br /><br />Many of the complaints that can be found here on amazon.com are simply misleading. One reviewer claims that you need to know Thai to read this book. Utter nonsense. Other reviewers have claimed that he misrepresents current Thailand. Well, of course. It isn't current Thailand, but Thailand 200 years into the future. If Bacigalupi can be said to be too optimistic in any way, it is in expecting some level of intelligence from his readers.<br /><br />Irrespectively on whether any of Bacigalupi's prophecies come true, I believe that this book will be remembered as a masterpiece for centuriesto come.
B002S43V3Y|5.0|It's a wonderful dark comedy but you have to listen carefully to completely understand the plot.  I've watched this film many times and this DVD was the only one that gave me a clue as to why the kid engaged in phony suicides.  You gotta have a broad sense of life to enjoy this film.
B00D6BQPMM|1.0|I'm glad that I did not waste money to see this at the theater, and wish I had not wasted my money renting it from Amazon.  This film might possibly appeal to kids, 14 years and younger.  There is no plot, no storyline, nothing that makes you burst out laughing, and Nicholas Hoult is a poor actor.
B000HZGNH2|3.0|It was just ok I guess, I like watching it from time to time! The stars had pretty good roles.
B003FHMHPQ|5.0|This book has been such a tremendous aid in discovering my true self and my life's work. You can feel the Love and support the author provide though her words and experience.
0316067598|5.0|Thank you to all members of the military. This book arrived in excellent condition and I am excited to read it before the movie comes out.
B0042EJD8A|5.0|I watched this on netflix , and i learned more than i wanted to know. Thanks to greed and any sign of intelligence our country is being attack, not by terrorism but that of the gas and oil corporations. please get call your rep or write them , this has to stop.[...]
B004KKX814|1.0|The low rating is due to way to long for delivery I ordered on 1 September is now 7 September still No bay blade  but the toy maybe fine the service from the distributor is terrible. I paid for three day shipping. Very disappointed! I will avoid this distributor In the future. And They should credit me for The shipping charges
B0080XN3C6|5.0|unique soulful eclectic sound. you can hear the influences of stevie wonder and prince. good job kimbra keep it up.
B003R0MF1W|5.0|Patrick Jane and the team fighting more bad guys, and a potential love comes looking for Patrick, what a surprise!
B000SW4DV2|5.0|I highly recommend this video because it's one of the few things that comes out of Hollywood that shows the Dad in a positive light. Funny. Clean. No language or use of God's name in vain. Very strong father/son relationship throughout movie. Love watching it over and over.
B00C8RDYUQ|5.0|I love Emily Blunt and the Star Wars guy in this film.  It has excellent view points and shows differences of culture.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Thoroughly enjoying. Colors...graphics certainly makes this game a keeper...esp when you're having to wait..drs office, airport.<br />I'm glad earlier issues with slowing down kindle and needing internet access to run has been fixed.
B0018M6J90|4.0|not a best seller but it was good enough to buy and watch a couple of times. I like the soundtrack in this film.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Really makes the time fly by and love that it speeds up!  El Macho's Lair is a great addition and very challenging.
B00004RFCM|5.0|Carrie and the girls are so awesome, they really give women something to be, and that is to not be ashamed!
1400095204|4.0|It is a lot more horrific than Purple Hibiscus.  Some of the sex and violence seems gratuitous.  The Biafran war is so far in the past, but yet it reflects on our current dilemma in Syria.
B000JCSPG0|4.0|This is a good movie, I love the idea but wish it had more information in it so it would last longer.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Very good book. Enjoyed the suspense. Thought you knew what was going to happen but then completely surprised. Would highly recommend
B0050PYNN0|4.0|not as funny as bridesmaids and the humor is certainly more vulgar but it was still funny and cool to see natalie portman in a comedy.
B00A8OWOSO|1.0|Too much dialog, story line hard to follow. After a while did not care about plot or movie itself. Goodfellas was a good mob movie.
B00003CXRP|5.0|Tom Cruise is amazing in this film, if it were anybody else then it would have been a terrible joke.
B0091WNK8M|1.0|This was a low budget poorly made movie. Supposed to be for kids, but movie starts out with a male statue with too much focus on the statues penis. Gratuitous. No reason for this kind of stuff to be in a kids movie. Also the pirate named &#34;one eyed Willie,&#34; wow if we didn't know what that joke was about. They could have left out the penis stuff and references to drugs. Of course that is Hollywood for you.
B00008G7UF|3.0|not what I expected from meg ryan but it was alright.  I could hardly understand kevin kline in this film.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|My son's enjoyed the movie, they can't wait for part 2.  They keep asking me when is it coming, and can their friends come over and watch it with them
0783235380|4.0|Sandra Bullock and Ben Affleck are so good together, this movie shows a different side of each individual, testing their abilities.
B00AECGQF2|4.0|I wish you could turn down (or off) the volume, but my granddaughter doesn't mind, just me.  Also, I wish there were a few more choices for the &#34;people&#34;.  The products and ability to cut, curl or color hair is great.  2 year old and 7 year old love it.
B004V9MU86|5.0|Captivating read, it hit home as a post war baby whose parents migrated from Germany post war, I loved Papa.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|The book gave a great look ok not the Federal Prison System, mainly the minimum security prisons. There were times the reading dragged but all in all, this was a great read
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is an awesome app! I have found no bugs whatsoever! So far, I am level 21 and have many ponies ^-^ My Gameloft LIVE username is mlplover6101.
B0091TGWYE|5.0|This case fits perfectly; and with the hard case feature, I feel more confident having my iPhone in this case!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Fast paced reacher thriller.  Surprised he took no one to bed,  cant wait to read next book. Want to catch up with him in virginia.
B005ZOBNOI|2.0|I was so excited to read this book because it is so many people's favorite book.  I read it in one day.  However this was not b/c it was so good as much as I just started wanting to get it over with.  This book was just silly.  It seems like it was written by a hormonal teenage girl with a lack of imagination.  Not very well written, not very interesting or engaging, and not much of a plot.  I am honestly baffled at the amount of positive reviews.  I know that John Green is on YouTube (and I like his videos I really do!) so maybe all of his fans are writing positive reviews.  Or maybe I'm just too old (20 years old).  Maybe this is meant for like 12 year olds.  I don't know.  Would not recommend if you are well read.  Sorry, I don't usually write negative book reviews but this was just really bad.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I love it, it's well structured to make you have fun for hours without get bored and it's just what I was looking for so long, a great game without the regular style of a character running and dodging stuff.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Game is very fun and addicting. Can't get enough of it the updates are great, smooth playing and overall awesomeness.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Love it even tho I can't create a game and u should be able to earn gold coins from 1st place wins
B006RXQ1L6|5.0|Richard Gere is a favorite.  So is Catherine Zeta-Jones and I do like musicals.  I was impressed by the depth of character in what seems like a very shallow story.  The music is super, the song-and-dance very cool, basically I loved it!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It's what I look for and I can catch up on all the gossip, spiritual,pictures and lots of fun. Kindle works for me .
B0081336FO|5.0|I so look forward to another season!  This series is much better than those I've seen on US networks.  Love it!
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I was able to go through so many categories about my favorite book and to receive information alerts is a good thing.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I enjoy both of these actors, and the plot lines are terrific.  The accents are occasionally difficult, but that adds to my enjoyment.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|Sometimes it works very well but then when I go on it again everything freezes and does not work..but overall it is fine
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Its an awesome experience!! :-) i like the fairy tale part of the book. Ana and Christian! love them !!!!
B00B7Y0206|3.0|I don't like it as much.as on the computer it lacks a lot.uther that it rocks.love the video's so much.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I just love \\"escape\\" games, and this one was a great break from other overly serious escape games. More please!
1475143389|4.0|This is the second book we purchased.  The first was either \\"borrowed\\" or misplaced.<br />I don't follow everything in this book,but It's well written and loaded with common sense information.<br />It works for beginners to advanced trainees.
B003Y6EL5W|5.0|I rented this movie expecting it to be a silly comedy.  I came away loving its creative and take on the superhero genre.
B002U3CCKQ|3.0|Gillian Flynn is amazing, but I guess I had already read her better works... This one too had a great plot but somehow I didn't find it as fascinating as Sharp Objects or Gine Girl
B006RXPUR2|4.0|It was a very intense movie and had surprise ending . A lot of my favorite actors were in this movie
B001S86J1C|4.0|This Matthew Broderick comedy is absolutely legendary now. The 25th Anniversary Edition (Bueller Bueller Edition) contains roughly 75 minutes of bonus content. The picture quality is average but the audio is above average. My only real complaint is the lack of deleted scenes and a director's commentary.<br /><br />Getting the Class Together<br />- The Cast of Ferris Bueller's Day Off<br />- The Making of Ferris Bueller's Day Off<br />- Who is Ferris Bueller?<br />- The World According to Ben Stein<br />- Vintage Ferris Bueller: The Lost Tapes<br />- Class Album<br /><br />Buy this Blu-ray.
B0063GORYU|4.0|The game helps to keep my mind active and sharp!  It makes you keep thinking and watching for more moves.
B0079KGAOY|2.0|This collection contains 4 films in a 5-disc set. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover have great chemistry in this series. The picture and audio quality are fairly good in this Blu-ray collection. The films included are the theatrical cuts of the films and not the director's cuts. There is almost 3 hours in bonus content which is light for a 4-film collection. The bonus disc isn't exactly jam-packed with extras (what is provided is good but not great and did not need a separate disc). Fans will have to decide for themselves if this Blu-ray collection is worth the upgrade. Since the longest featurette is 31 minutes it does leave some fans longing for more. A 4-hour retrospective documentary on the franchise would really complete this collection. I rate the films 4 stars and this collection gets 2 stars.
0142418471|5.0|This bbook was for my daughter, she is 14 and loves to read. She has read John Green´s books and she has loved them all.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Great prediction and now with swypelike function,  awesome comes to mind.  (the rest of this is filler and the end)
B0074QGGK6|5.0|Written like the author is giving advice to his younger self; This book is a great introduction to remixing, or rather, stealing ideas to imitate and emulate.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|I'm to Season 3 already.  It's a funny, entertaining and easy show to watch - 21 minutes long.  Not too cerebral, but enjoyable to watch.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|On droid 2, it opens, then closes immediately. No error. No force close. It just goes away after downloading the 26 MB or so of content.
0345529057|5.0|came fast and in good shape,was bought for my wife to fill all the gaps between episodes in the seasons 1 and 2.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Amazing story! Value life not things and there is true love for all! Go to NC and visit! So inspiring!!!
B004EPZ06Q|5.0|Much better than the second movie.  Really liked it.  Not sure why I have to write any more words than the foregoing but that's what this sentence is for.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|lot of action, decent plot good action, they want 17 words.  decent movie you will like it enjoy the movie
0307476464|1.0|This book is way too tangent-y. I felt like the author had a collection of short stories that were about to expire so he threw them all in as rabbit holes. I was so sick of the main characters at the half way point, I really didn't care to leave it unresolved. I feel like I'm walking around in a bad mood and need to move on from the book to spare my family.
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|The graphic and needless display of violence in the first ten minutes was downright sick.  What is wrong with Hollywood?
B0030ZOYJ0|1.0|I avoided this series for a long time because I thought it would be nothing but giant robots fighting monsters, which is cool and all, but I could never commit to a whole series based on that alone. But when I heard that it's actually more about character development, I became hopeful, and decided to check out the movie at least.<br /><br />And... it was pretty much giant robots fighting monsters. It is real clear that this was the driving force of the film, as these scenes were beautiful. But the characters that I were promised were amazing... They fell completely flat. There is no depth to them at all, and any development seemed extremely forced. I could not get invested in them at all, and did not care if they lived or died. It was a chore to finish this film, and I do not think I shall be watching the others.<br /><br />Now, to be fair, I STILL haven't watched the series. This review is for the film itself. For all I know, the characters in the show are GREAT, but if they are anything like they are here, then I will surely be avoiding that as well.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Good game that progressively got more challenging but not too much! Would like to see some harder levels in the update. Well done!
B0042MEQVG|2.0|I bought this for a friend.  I am not a fan of the Twilight Saga or the sparkly vampires... She enjoyed it though.
B003Y74KCK|2.0|It was not as white as it looks in the picture and is not sturdy enough. I would not recommend it.
B000B5XOSO|4.0|I like the first two batmans the most because I am a Tim Burton fan. It's not his best work, but they are still enjoyable and Danny DeVito plays a great penguin!
0553801473|3.0|OK, it's book 5 (after thinking I had purchased the entire story with the first 4 volumes), and I have less than 200 pages to go, and it isn't apparent that Martin can end this tale in this book.  Too many stories, with too many characters that do nothing to move the story forward.  One gets to feeling trapped in an endless soap opera, even though there are so many elements of masterpiece in this work.  I think Martin needed the firm hand of a good editor.  The story is basically superb, but your reader would appreciate the discipline of cutting non-essential descriptions, characters, and side-line stories.
0679809015|4.0|My 2 year old son loves to lift the flaps and see the animals.  He makes the sounds of the animals he sees and it is great for his development.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This book is packed with action, murder, betrayal, mysteries -so packed that at times I felt overwhelmed. However, I can't deny how much I enjoyed it. I cried, I gasped, I chuckled (a little) and spent a week completely engrossed in the story. I have no idea how this series will end but I'm enjoying the ride immensely.
B00COGY2P2|5.0|I'm not one to praise movies... and especially Tom Cruise movies... but this one took our breath away.  All of us.  Including my wife, who generally hates Tom Cruise movies.  And my son, who thinks Tom Cruise is just some old dude who was famous in the eighties when he danced through the house in his underwear.  But this movie grabbed them both by the throat and didn't let them breathe until the last frame.  It was a superb storyline with great performances and fantastic cinematography.<br /><br />It was shockingly good!
B000FCKGPC|4.0|In this book, Martin introduced so many new point-of-view characters that I found myself struggling a bit at times. Even though the story was still compelling, the scope was too broad in this book. I missed checking in with several of the main characters (including my favorites). I can only imagine how frustrating it must have been to have read this book when it was released only to have to have waited six more years for the fifth book.
1616550414|5.0|Dark Horse Books and Nintendo team up to bring you The Legend of Zelda: Hyrule Historia, containing an unparalleled collection of historical information on The Legend of Zelda franchise.

B008CPRLP2|4.0|I've used WinZip in various configurations for years.  This is the first Android WinZip I've used, and it delivers just like it's Windows predecessors.  Very good, intuitive, easy to use...and it's FREE.  Highly recommended.
B0017M413M|5.0|For those of us who felt disappointed in the series finale for Stargate: SG-1, our ship has come in!  This movie helps to truly conclude the Stargate series, with the climactic ending to the war with the Ori.  A must-see for Stargate fans!!
B0050DIWFC|2.0|Read this with a book club.  Characters were not developed which made me very uninterested in the outcome.  Waste of my time
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I really like this application.  I especially enjoy the way you can combine different sounds to make a unique new sound of your own.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|A very intersing story without violence. Good actors. I'm waiting for the next season. I want moré atoréis like this.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It was very intense. I enjoyed this book.  I only wish there were more books; I liked the twists in the plot.
0307120007|5.0|A classic book for kids. There is a bit of a dated feel to the content of this one for the adults, but that doesn't seem to stop the next generation for loving this interactive book.  The furry bunny, putting the finger through Mommy's ring, all the interaction seem just right for 1 year old (or so) and seems to pull words right out of them.  Our girl probably said 4-5 new words from this book.  Hey, that's more fun for a parent than a book with modern content!
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|I loved this movie, this is such an inspirational story.<br /><br />Bethany Hamilton had every reason to be mad at God.  Instead she learns to rely on her faith and her family to pursue her dream to become a professional surfer.<br /><br />This movie is so amazing and Bethany's story is so amazing.  I love what she is able to accomplish with one arm! I don't think I could do half of that with two!
B00E0MCYPS|5.0|You get impressive graphics and tons of options, whether it's soundtrack, control mode, view, number of opponents and laps, speed of the race, you name it.<br />It's NOT difficult to control though the traction on a dirt track is lower than I thought it should be. Well, this game isn't played by pedal to the metal alone , slow down - that's that arrow on the left side - when going around bends. I won the first race I set up without problems but you can make it as challenging as you want.<br />The first challenge is a time trial, and it's not a walk in the park. If you make no mistakes like Spinout, you will pass, but ONE such mistake and you better restart.<br />I found tilt control best, and you rarely need to brake, just turn auto gas off and ease on the gas when needed.<br />Good for beginners and pros, just get used to NOT going full speed all the time like in most racers. This isn't Outrun. Easy does.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|I have loved the writing in all his books. None of them make for easy reading but they are very real and so human. No neat tied-up endings and lots of human frailties. Don't miss it
B007DIQC90|4.0|It filled my need for catchy, quirky, smart, thoughtful, fun music. Check it out -- it's the Lumineers meets Bjork
B004S5C91Q|5.0|I really like that this story didn't go in the expected direction. It made you go on thinking about it for days after you'd finished reading it. The effect on the child was so different from that on the adult
0988936402|1.0|I read between 2 and 6 books a week, the majority from the free selection here on Amazon.  It has been years since I didn't finish a book and this book broke that streak.  Plot was totally generic and uninterested.  Characters were not well developed and felt one-dimensional and utterly failed to engage even the slightest shred of interest or empathy.  I made it 22% of the way through the book before I just couldn't read any more.  There wasn't a single aspect of any character or plot that was in the least bit entertaining or enjoyable and I finally found that reading it was becoming a chore so I stopped.  I have no idea how other people have rated this so well.  This was by far the largest difference between the general rating and my personal rating that I've encountered so far.
B0058W74UY|2.0|Not a good app for me.  After I opened it I became confused, and I couldn't find a help screen.
0679735909|2.0|The purchase is too small to make a fuss about but I do have some questions and comments. The book, an old paperback of Possession, was billed as &#34;New.&#34; It was described as &#34;still in shrink wrap.&#34; I really expected a NEW book. But I got a book that had breaks in the edge where the covers and spine meet, strongly suggesting that it had been used and read. &#34;Still in shrink wrap&#34; seems strange since when it was newly published and on bookstore shelves it was never shrink wrapped to start with. AND if it has been shrink wrapped then why all the pages browned for an inch into the book from oxidation. How does it get oxidized in the absence of air in shrink wrap. I must say that my old copy (which I am replacing because of a flood at home and water damage) still had very white pages in spite of it sitting on my library shelves all these years. I have been quite mystified by the gradations of books on Amazon. How can so many copies of this and other books be sold as &#34;New&#34;  with a description of various degrees of use. I have also received a valuable book described as Near Fine that was stained and bore what I interpreted as mold damage on the cover. Another marked as Very Good came all battered, but that could have been the terribly inadequate packaging. I have also received truly New, unused, unread, mint copied of books with older publication dates. I don't wish to belabor the point, but I do want to ask, What does &#34;new&#34; really mean as applied to old books with yellowed pages with or without shrink wrap.
B000P0J024|5.0|These old guys can rock!  I love it. Glad I found it on Amazon. This is a Great CD, even &#34;to the end of the line&#34;
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Loved this book. Perfect follow up to The Fall of Giants. Loved how he kept the characters from Fall of Giants and weaves them into this story. Just brilliant!
B00B7Y0206|4.0|Love YouTube. I love to play gospel videos from there. I use l the time. I would recommend to others
B00E0MCYPS|5.0|I don't understand the complaints, this game plays great, graphics are fantastic, steering works well. Iwwould like faster progression in the game but otherwise very well done.  My biggest complaint is that it is addictive.
B0098460O4|5.0|The English, young adults are awesome.  I listen to it often and enjoy it each time.  If you like this type of music you will enjoy this CD immensely.
0385528787|4.0|`MaddAddam' is the final volume in the near future dystopian trilogy that started with `Oryx and Crake' and continued with `The Year of the Flood'. While the events in the first two novels about the end of the world as we know it took place at the same time, albeit with different casts of characters, `MaddAddam' moves us forward in time and unites the two sets of characters. Jimmy, once Crake's best friend, now deathly ill with an infection, is in the care of the remnants of God's Gardeners, an ecological/religious group, who also find themselves the caretakers of the Craker's, those innocent, leaf eating people who Crake created as replacements for the fatally flawed human race. The group is also imperiled by two of the Painballers- former prisoners who earned their freedom in gladiator style fights that burned out their ability to feel empathy and left them with a huge appetite for torture- who are lurking in the forest that surround their home and garden.  An even bigger peril they face is the fact that food and other supplies are rapidly running out; it's getting harder and harder to find anything useful in the remnants of the city, and they have no ideas how to survive in Stone Age conditions.<br /><br />While the plot that moves the book along is how the group deals with the Painballers, it really doesn't take up much of the text. The majority of the story is Zeb's history: how he and his brother (who became MaddAddam) grew up tortured by their father, the head of the Church of PetrOleum; and the close calls he had after running away. This history serves to tell us about how the world right before the apocalypse was functioning.<br /><br />It's a horrific world that God's Gardeners and the rest inhabit, but t he real horror is that humans already possess the technology to make all the creatures in this book, including the deadly diseases that wipe out humanity and the Painballers with their inability to care about anyone other than themselves. We are already on the course of megacorporations taking over our lives and government. Ice caps are already melting and permafrost thawing. The gap between rich and poor widens.<br /><br />`MaddAddam' is brilliantly written and serves as a warning about the path we're headed down. But it's not preachy; it's a damn good adventure story. My only complaint was with the character of Toby; in `Year of the Flood' she is an incredibly strong person, focused and capable. In `MaddAddam', we witness her relationship with Zeb turning her into an insecure, jealous woman, tortured by doubts about Zeb's feelings for her and whether he is having sex with other women- especially one who is putting on a display of her sexual readiness for all the males of the camp. This bothered me a lot to see Toby reduced to this state, but later I wondered: was she written like this to compare her to the Crakers, who have no sexual jealousy? Or to show that in a situation where the world has ended and must be rebuilt, the fertile woman is reduced to her ability to repopulate the world? Or perhaps just that no matter what happens in the larger world, human beings will be human beings. I don't know, but I found it very irritating.<br /><br />The best part of the book is the way that big parts of it are told by Toby to the Crakers in their nightly story time. You only hear Toby's voice; what the Crakers are saying and doing is implied by her answers. I found their naivety funny and felt sympathy for Toby's frustration with their incessant questions. One of the most surprising things in the book is who became the allies of the God's Gardeners in the end.<br /><br />While it wasn't the most satisfying conclusion, it's still a very good book. It's a standalone novel and has a `the story so far' section in the front, but I recommend reading the first two volumes before this one.n the course of megacorporations taking over our lives and government.

B00EQUP3Q6|5.0|to every album under the Nine Inch Nails monaker. I've had my reservations about some parts of this album, but after 5 days I can honestly say I've enjoyed every single re-listen I have given it. This album most certainly continues the story that thrives beneath the lyrics and musical narrative in all main Nine Inch Nails album aside from Ghosts and Year Zero. It encompasses sounds that pull from With Teeth, Fragile, Downward Spiral, and The Slip. Everyone was skeptical when \\"Everything\\" was released, but honestly this is one of my favorite songs. Placed, pretty much smack dab in the middle of the album, it's a breath of release and fresh air for the album. Fast and simple, but with a more bright sound than the usual nine inch nails brooding and dark. It starts off a little iffy, but every second that goes by the song gets better and better. My favorites off the album are \\"Copy of A\\", \\"Satellite\\", \\"Disappointed\\", \\"Everything\\", \\"All Time Low\\", \\"In Two\\", \\"Running\\", \\"While I'm Still Here\\" and \\"I Would for You\\"...Yeah thats pretty much the whole album. If you're not a big Nails fan...you might want to give the album a listen after you try some older stuff. If you can get big into music you have to dig deep to understand and enjoy, this is a good album by a really meticulous individual. And what's cool for Nine Inch Nails fans is, alot of Trents band was involved in the album in some way. Which is sort of rare. Adrien Belew is on the album as well. He's actually on  a good majority of it. This album is more of an electronically based album however, so anyone looking for alot of track like ones you'll find on the first half of The Slip....might want to think twice. It's Nine Inch Nails all the way. More like pretty hate machine and Downward Spiral than The Slip. Don't get me wrong it does carry a sound that defines all the past albums.<br />This is quickly becoming one of my favorite albums. If you're open minded, give it a shot.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|LOVE this game but unfortunately I haven't been able to play in a couple of weeks. It crashes while loading. I tried deleting it from my Kindle &amp; reinstalling but that didn't help either.  Please fix whatever bug is causing this &amp; I'll update this review &amp; give you 5 stars.
B004X80QNG|1.0|As soon as I opened it I was told to download it again from amazon, then it crashed.  It was free and even that was way too much
B00A6WSTIW|1.0|You will never get back the hour and a half that you waste watching this movie. Just pick something else.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Good graphics. Enjoyable and entertaining. Easy to use and works well with their kindle fire. I would recommend this especially if you enjoy horses.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|This is one of the coolest tower defense games I've played on the tablet. Easy to learn and easy to use hours of fun. Only thing I don't like is that upgrades cost allot of gems that take awhile to earn. You can buy gems but who wants to do that?
B00EH6SK78|5.0|Killer riffs,melodic intros,insane vocals,another triumph for the metal titans! I nor you should expect less! Dez fafara has proven him and devildriver are masters of metal!
0321934318|4.0|It takes you step by step in clear language through the program. Good resource for beginners and intermediate users. Liked it
0790729350|5.0|I was at Woodstock.  Now my kid is learning all about it, and we watched the movie together.  How cool is that?
B00CL68BK2|4.0|My gf rented this movie after reading the book. When prompted with the question &#34;how would you rate it?&#34; The reply was &#34;I don't know...3 or 4. I liked it, but it was really slow&#34; there you have it ladies and gents. Also you must take this with a grain of salt because it seems like anytime someone reads a book before watching a movie they must slam the movie because they want people to know they read the book.... Just my opinion.
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|I googled &quot;how to download candy crush saga to my kindle fire&quot; and Yes!!!! I now have it on my kindle fire connected to facebook works fast SOOOOO HAPPY.... just to it! it's so easy! reliable site! now just want Gardens of Time and I'll be fine;)
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Lots of variety within the game. You don't have to spend a lot of your time to trying to figure out what to do next. I liked it.
B0019IIPXQ|1.0|I mean it just did not work at all. It came up as a black screen and then absolutely nothing happened.
B00EDF43MY|5.0|Our son is learning about the airport process and we're glad he gets to do it with a game instead of watching us, his parents, who are usually short tempered and stressed out during a real-life airport experience.
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|It's fun but sometimes they don't make sense but you will never get bored with it at all. Just a little confusing
B00785P2QC|3.0|I'm addicted to this game. I just wish you could get investment points quicker without havin to buy them. I highly recommend it though.
B00BC5I6Q2|3.0|Shows the inner workings of congress, senate, etc.  The power plays.  However, too sexually explicit for me to recommend. They didn't need to show all these things and you could still get the picture of whats what.
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|Anything having to do with STAR TREK is about idealism more than anything else, and that includes this film.<br /><br />That being said, before you decide to purchase this, please read this:<br /><br />[...]
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Very interesting in seeing this kind of living in this period of time.  No explicit sexual scenes (good).  Seeing into the servants' lives who lived in these large mansions in England is really interesting.  You get into each character and hate for the series to end.<br />Highly recommend it to those who are not looking for violence and sexual scenes.
B009AY04A8|5.0|I like hidden object games and this one is pretty good.  Silly dialog, but hey, its a story and it goes with the theme.  You need to learn to not take your finger off of the screen to look around in zoom mode or it counts against you. (This is a common problem with this type of game, so not surprising.)
B000FA5SMK|3.0|too long to much the same stuff took a while to read i was bored so i didn't even finish it.
B0058VW36U|5.0|My son said its awesome! He would highly recommend this game to his family and friends. Just gotta love it!
B00AA0U05A|4.0|This is pretty good but I'm not sure I'm in love with it.  I have been playing it pretty often
B008JFUO4U|3.0|as concise a review as i can manage is - it's okay- i watched it once and had no desire to watch it again.
B00B2GK4KW|5.0|I rated this item because I really like it.  When I first saw the demo on youtube I was inspired to create something different.  My good friend Ruth recommended that I check it out and now I have four additional punch designs.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Look below the surface of this outstanding work of fiction. So many dilemmas to consider. One of the best books of 2013, if not The Best. Highly recommended. Five star plus!
B00633W614|3.0|Good until the last chapter . I hate when a book doesn't end though. I don't like to have to read another book to find out what is going on.
B000KIE11Q|3.0|A truly great looking watch but very bad strap design. The strap is only held together with very flimsy plastic/rubber. Mine has broken numerous times. Bought a spare strap to butcher the parts which I have now exhausted. Need buy yet another for over 30 quid!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this series and cannot wait for next season! It is beautifully done, down to the silverware! The costumes are amazing.
B004LB59VE|2.0|This is a story that counts down the life of a dying man, interminably rambling backwards and forwards, and believe me, never did a character take sooooo long to die. I, for one, was very relieved when he finally shuffled off the mortal coil! It would be unfair to say there weren't any interesting bits, but they were too few to make this a page turner for me. It reminded me of the exercise writers are given to clear a writer's block... i.e. write down anything that comes to mind and never mind what drips out of the nib, or taps off the keyboard! I am not tempted to read another Paul Harding.
B003QSEKTU|3.0|We did not watch it but used it as an evening entertainment for pre-teens.  They seemed to really enjoy it.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Never have been much of a series watcher, so really like the idea of having whole seasons presented.  I had never heard of this one but thought the political bent might be interesting, given what we hear coming out of Washington these days. Am approaching the end of season 1 but can't warm up to some of the characters. Maybe &#34;The Good Wife&#34; was a tongue in cheek title as I find Alicia to be &#34;chilly&#34; and self-serving (in a quiet & devious way). She is more likely the good political wife (great portrayal there).  However the court cases depicted are varied and very well done - really have enjoyed the investigations by Kalinda and her ability to cut through the bs in short order.  As a conservative, have enjoyed the &#34;Marlboro man&#34; ballistics expert and his interaction with Diane - enough humor there to make me laugh. There are other characters being introduced that hold promise to add spice to the show - Ely Gold & Patti (cryptic lawyer w/new baby) are 2 that I hope reappear. Intend to continue with the series and recommend the program to other viewers. Checked google and discovered  a season 5 is coming, so Amazon Prime has done a good job in offering all 4 previous years to its subscribers.
B006LS7DQE|1.0|the game is amazing on other platforms... sadly it doesn't work on my tablet... it keep crashing at random interval during game play :(
B00AKYRCNY|4.0|Any puzzle game is liked by both boys. This is too simple but builds confidence with the older boy and simple and accomplish able for the younger. As long as they both go to it frequently we'll keep it around
B004DLPXAO|1.0|It worked for 3 months and then simply stopped. I'm guessing that some new 'update' for the app rendered it inoperable. I cannot get it to work again! I contacted Amazon and they were unable to help me. Apparently the Kindle app came pre-installed on my phone and can't be completely wiped. There might be a way be gaining root control of my phone but I'm a little leery about trying this. I suppose I'll have to take the phone (HTC ONE android) somewhere (who knows where) to see if I can get this issue resolved
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|My husbands favorite series as a kid next to Star Wars of course. Very nice box set looks great in our collection. And we got it for a steal awesome!!
B00ANAC32U|5.0|This bumper should protect the phone and it looks like it is part of the phone.  I object to this word requirement and will not comment on the next product because of it.
0062278096|5.0|My husband got this for me because he knows I'm the biggest Benedict Cumberbatch. I think hands down he makes the best Sherlock Holmes. I like Martin FreeMan too. This book is chalked full of great information, for the most die hard fan of the series. Oh by the way the 3rd season is suppose to begin again January 1, 2014 what a way to begin the new year!!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I highly enjoy these types of games and it's refreshing not having to pay in order to have the full game. The only issue I have is the energy, I love losing myself in these games for hours. But with the energy I can play for maybe 10 minutes, then I have to wait for hours for it to recharge.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I really like the tracks with the remarkable violin playing absolutely amazing. Whenever I pick up a Celtic Woman Cd I know I'll never be disappointment. My favorite track is track 8 it's titled butterfly
B00992CF6W|5.0|So I have a kindle fire. And my bff has an IPod. I can connect to her IPod, but she can't connect to my Kindle. Also...sometimes when I try to join other players...it won't even show a screen name to connect. Also when destroying blocks...sometimes it glitches and goes super fast....then normal. It actually happens ALL THE TIME!!!! I enjoy this game ALOT and play it 24/7 but there are glitches that need to be solved.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|It was a two step process to search the internet before the google install  now it is a one touch app and faster time as well.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|This series is hard to stop watching.  It has so much action and a rich story line.  If you love drama and suspense then this is the series for you!
B0017IKR7K|5.0|This is a really good collection of Brad Paisley's work. He really demonstrates what a great musician he is. Great guitar!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Awesome app. It really learns your typing style very quickly and the predictive text works great on my Galaxy S4. Also, it can almost always get what I'm trying to spell, no matter how bad it is. All in all a really nice keyboard which happens to have some really good looking themes.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|She's awesome singer love this song! Along with others she has sang! I would buy this if I were you! ;D
B003ASLJK4|5.0|beautiful love story, Clint Eastwood is great as a romantic lead and Meryl Streep never disappoints, would recommend this DVD
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|As an author of over thirty books, it's hard for me to not guess every plot twist and turn.  Broadchurch delivers - what a ride!<br /><br />Alane Ferguson
B007THA4FI|3.0|J.K. Rowling is a phenomenal writer.  However, &#34;Casual Vacancy&#34; was not one of her best.  Check out &#34;Cuckoo's Calling&#34; for a really great read.  You'll never guess 'whodunit!'
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This was recommended by my reading group or I may have missed it and that would have been a shame.  The main characters unfold and change as the story proceeds, an effect any good pilgrimage will accomplish.  However, this author captures it so beautifully in  language that is well crafted and rich.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game is so spectac and I won't stop playing it until the next comes out. I love it my boyfriend loves it my besties love it. We can't wait for it the other it's gonna be totes epic
0307474275|4.0|Great read. When this was released I was very excited to read it, but saved it for a much dreaded flight- I hate planes. Hate them- and it did exactly what I had hoped. I was able to lose myself in the story & hardly noticed the storm & turbulence. I felt that The Da Vinci Code wasn't so much of a great story, but a mediocre story attached to a sensational & scandalous subject. However, he owned it, the book was well marketed, and he enjoyed wonderful success. I give him respect for that. It is both sad & amusing that so many people have changed their religious beliefs based on a fictitious story, but that is what makes it so great.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|You have to work to gain up your points and do stuff but I like it! My daughter and I love playing it together.
B008K6HN8I|1.0|This was the biggest waste of time all  I wanted to do was find out how to watch youtube videos but if you want to do that with this app its impossible.
B00E0MCYPS|1.0|This game is so horrible! It sucks at steering and also its very hard to control. If you push the buttons or barely tilt it, it goes outta Whack! I DO NOT recommend this game for people who aren't patient.
0143122916|5.0|Its such a shame that this is not in the main stream media. More people should know about what is happening around them.  This book gives some insight.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Awesome gameplay once u get going keeps u occupied for a while all around pretty good but making major battles whit multiple people would be awesome
0345803507|5.0|im half way through the book but oh my god it is very incising and is hard to put down just like the first two books in the series. it is full of hot steamy passion and playful love scenes definitely worth buying
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Good eye and hand coordination, and exercise for the brain. I like the story line easy to follow and you can use your own imagination and be looking for the artifact and go as fast as you can to beat your time. Fun for me anyway<br />ele ross
B00AHJL7BK|4.0|I like the way you can change the numbers that do not work . Iwould suggest that you start at the 5x5 for several tries before advancing
B000001F76|4.0|Hank Williams led a short, but productive life.  These songs were originally recorded in mono on 78 rpm records, but the producers have managed to give them a stereo sound.  This is an encompassing collection of most of Hank William's hits.  He is definitely worth a listen as his music is a part of America's musical heritage.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|This shows nothing of words that people need to learn. I am sick of this y'all do not know what a dictionary is at all. How about them apples
B00BG08FKK|5.0|When Les Miserables was filmed, they decided to record the singing while the performers were acting rather than in a studio.  I believe this is the first time music from a movie musical was recorded this way.  The result is a rich, vibrant sound making you feel like you are there with them.  It is a beautiful two CD set.
B0087YYHZU|5.0|It's as good as the genre gets and as perfect as a movie can be. It was a crime that it did not win Best Picture for 1952 and an even bigger crime - imagine this - that it was not even nominated! It's the fanciful story of how Hollywood adapted to the advent of sound in movies, but that's only the pretext for some of the most wonderful song-and-dance numbers you will ever see, particularly the immortal title song, probably the most sublimely happy sequence ever filmed, one that composer Leonard Bernstein once described as \\"a reaffirmation of life.\\" In one of the most memorable moments of my life, I once attended a screening of the movie at the American Film Institute at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., with Gene Kelly in the audience. When the title song began, half of the audience started to clap and cheer, while the other half began shushing them so they could enjoy the number - the shushers won. Then, when the number ended, the entire audience erupted in a prolonged standing ovation for Kelly - who walked out on stage after the screening and promptly praised his co-star Donald O'Connor, whose performance of \\"Make `em Laugh\\" is equally classic. The two female leads - the young Debbie Reynolds and the versatile Jean Hagen - are sensational, as is Cyd Charisse, who dances a duet with Kelly that's as sexy as musical interludes get on the screen. This is a joy from beginning to end, and like The Wizard of Oz and It's a Wonderful Life, it's something to be savored again and again. Don't ever consider your moviegoing life complete without seeing it. Reynolds, in a 2004 interview with Turner Classic Movies host Robert Osborne, described the grueling ordeal of rehearsals for the dance numbers, which went on for days and days under Kelly's tutorage. She said, \\"But he must have taught me well, because here I am 52 years later and still in the movie business, and it was because of Gene Kelly's teaching.\\" [[ASIN:B00HU8VK4K Phil's Favorite 500: Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime (2014 edition)]]
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I found &quot;Can You Escape&quot; to be enjoyable and not without challenge.  I would recommend for some fun time<br />Gatsbysmom
B000T4EDXC|1.0|hollywood franchise:<br />1.  take beloved icon<br />2.  change beloved icon to not resemble said icon, except in name<br />3.  fans complain.  screw them, who needs fans.<br />4.  fans complain.  do minimum to appease them (aka godzilla was missing atomic breath, so put one small scene (only) of him breathing fire, for no reason, to appease said fans).<br />5.  directed, produced, and starring people who have no idea who godzilla is.  recipe for perfection.<br /><br />a crappy movie worthy of a robot chicken parody (and done! \\"That Hurts Me\\"), which sadly, the parodies are better godzilla movies.<br /><br />godzilla by (movie right) name only.  Change the name, it would be a big budget syfy movie (dino-iguana).
B00DP3IESY|4.0|Tom Cruise does his usual stand up job at playing a hero. Morgan makes you actually care, unlike number 42's wife.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|like so many others, I hate the upgrade. It is hard to see, hard to understand, and not User friendly. I will be deleting this app after using it daily for over a year.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I am enjoying this game very much. I Played for about two hours before I really started getting the hang of it. Don't spend those diamonds too freely.  They are not cheap!
B005GIS1WA|5.0|I, as well as my 2 year old son, love this movie!  It's so funny with a such a wonderful cast of actors; however, the music in this movie is really what makes it so great.  Whenever the songs come on, my son and I have to dance because it just makes you want to get up and shake your booty.  I just think everything in the movie is wonderful . . . the story, animation, comedic banter, actors, and music.  I definitely recommend purchasing this movie for everyone of all ages!
B0058VW36U|5.0|I gave this game 5 stars because the interface is well done, and the game is very fun and addicting. I liked that there is a lot of puzzles to do, and for mobile games I love puzzles because they can entertain me for hours. I would recommend this game to anyone.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I gave it 5 stars because every single song in this album is awesome. Stirling is awesome. Anyone who has a wide range of taste of music, that includes from classical to the latest in music should listen to this.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I gave this app 5 stars because it does exactly what it says it do. So far I haven't have any problems with it, and thanks to it I can listen to my favorite youtube vids even when I'm out of wi-fi range.
B00CFYAT6O|2.0|This album is stronger than their previous album (Revelator), but as a longtime Derek Trucks fan, this band and this album still leaves me flat, bored and disappointed. Susan Tedeschi's vocals are extremely grating-- she belts, yells & screams at the top of her lungs on every song, and it's exhausting (and annoying) to listen to. It's way too much and not musically pleasing or tasteful at all. Fans of her will like it, but if you're listening to this for Trucks' guitar playing (like me), you'll have to suffer and cringe through Tedeschi's in-your-face vocals. Someone needs to clue her in that \\"less is often more\\"... Save your money and skip this album (and stop financing the lumbering beast that is Tedeschi Trucks Band)
B002ZG9968|3.0|This movie is great but the info should be changed some, I bought this movie because it sounded like threw the whole movie she hides her bun in the stomic....... she only hides it like for 10 minutes or something it shoulf of said how Jennifer gets pregnate and how the guy agrees to still be with her and how its challanging but he refuses to leave but its still funny
B001GF1XN6|4.0|the quality of the dvd was excellent color was sharp and the sound was clear I expect it to become a cult classic
B007ZD17XO|5.0|The art and color in this game are stunning! It is stimulating and yet does not require my 100% attention, so TV can be playing on things that don't require full focus, and I can do both. It is the most gorgeous game I've gotten free. Someone did a lot of work to create it. I am glad I got it.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Not a bad read. My 12 hours of flight just flew by, exactly the kind of page turner I was looking for.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|A little predictable but that's so easily lost in the magic of broadway each character is relatable in their own right
B009UX2YAC|5.0|We love this game. My kids and I play it together.<br />Even my 3year old son can plat it. He love's trying not die.
B005PK57NU|5.0|fun to see the characters evolve from season to season. I also love the legal stories they tackle, very thought provoking
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I got suckered in and read all 3 books.  All that time I wasted, I could have done something constructive.
B002MFULQO|3.0|Rather than provide a an intriguing story with some plausibility as to who else could have been involved in the assassination, we get this. There are too many theories introduced and way too many characters. It all gets wrapped up with a long winded diatribe that everyone was in on it. Castro, the CIA, the Dallas Police. Olive Stone is truly a nut job.
0880794968|5.0|If you are familiar with and like the Universal Waite Tarot Deck (and most people are who read tarot) you will love this new incarnation.  It is exactly the same as the original except the colors are brighter.  Makes the cards easier to read and frankly, they just appear more cheerful.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|A must read, it's an  AMAZING story about a young college student named Anastasia Steele, she meets a rich alpha male Christian Grey with 50shades of crazy. E l James is a great story teller, in detail she will lead you into a dark world full of lust, passion and true love. For me it was a incredible story.
B00AEFZ6V4|4.0|The story line was really good and fun to watch. The cast preformed the rolls well. Michelle Pfeiffer played a great wicked witch. It was exciting and kept your interest.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I loved The Kite Runner.  Second and third books were disappointing. Tribal Afghans are good story tellers. This book was missing something.  Maybe it jumped around too much and tried to tell too many stories at once.
B007THA4FI|5.0|Haven't finished it but I find it well written and good character study of life in a small English village.  Interesting people with paths that cross in the geographic place they are planted.
B001S49AQW|5.0|From the first to the last, this novel has all the best--great & funny characters, fast paced plot, a villain and a wonderful ending! The heroine, Hero, is just a ditzi doll. Anthony \\"Sherry\\" is a bit selfish but funny hero, and treats his wife like one of the guys. The scrapes she gets into keep him and his friends hopping! Add the pickpocket, Jason, who \\"forks\\" almost everybody and you are guaranteed a laugh a minute. This is one of my top 5 faves !
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I do really enjoy the game. However, there are a few things that need to be fixed. 1. It cost way too much to buy things in the game. 2. It's way too easy to accidentally spend gems. There really needs to be an Approve/Cancel option when spending gems. 3. Customer support are not the best for this game. I've submitted several issues with the game, reported bugs/glitches, & tried to get back my gems and no one has replied too me on any of them. The game is fun though. It just has it's fair share of issues. They have been slowly working on some though.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was admittedly a bit skeptical that a self-published book could really be this good.  I'm happy to admit I was wrong.  This was a well-conceived and written story that kept me engaged all the way through.  Fans of other dystopian-style novels will definitely enjoy this great book.  I'm excited to read the next two volumes in the saga!
B00E193TM2|3.0|While an improvement over American Capitalist, this album is still a disappointment when compared to their first two releases.  Songs like \\"Lift Me Up\\" and \\"Anywhere But Here\\" are terrific, but there is just too much filler and repetitive stuff.  What other band would put the same songs on their album twice?  Some people may argue that this is \\"unique\\" or \\"interesting\\" - I think it's just lazy and an attempt to force a double album release for more money.  In fact, if you throw in the awful cover song and \\"instrumental / spoken word song,\\" you could argue this is only a 9 song release.  Here's hoping Volume 2 is where all of the good songs are hiding.
B00BAB6CNC|2.0|I've been a fan of Stone Sour for years.  I loved their first few releases.  They all had the perfect mix of hard rock/heavy metal & slower, more melodic rock.  I would even have argued that Stone Sour was a better vehicle for Corey Taylor than Slipknot.  Unfortunately, the House of Gold & Bones releases have let me down.  Stone Sour has become another band in a recent line that either don't know how to trim the filler from their songs to release one solid album or just don't care.  I realize this is meant to be a &#34;story&#34; or a &#34;concept album&#34; but the music just doesn't work for me.  There's quite simply too much generic rock.  It's a shame because the best songs off of both releases would have made one incredible album.
0897502027|5.0|This book sums up not only the style of fighting and training in martial arts but the way that someone should live.<br />It offers great perspective in life as ofcourse martial arts are not for fighting but to provide a balance in our way of living.<br />It was written by a man who understood the limitations of specific philosophies and martial arts training in order to help the reader/practioner to overcome those limitations and create something of their on and for themselves.<br />As a psychologist I recommend this book along with Emotional Intelligence by Goleman.<br />Give it a try and you won't be dissapointed.<br />It's easier to keep an open mind when you already train in some kind of martial art (preferably an eastern one).<br />A great book by a great man who still had much more to give.
B00AGE20ZI|5.0|It's a Wonderful Life -- A Christmas Story are grand movies for the holidays . The Bishops Wife is outstandingly  different and a holds a special place in my heart .  It reminds me of my mom , whom I miss dearly , as you see I watched with her many times.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|Is a perfect gift for Dad who is from Linden TX and has grown up with the Eagles music all his life.  Perfect music to while away the evening hours.  Gotta love all that great Don Henley prose put to music.
B00DBSZEH2|5.0|It's about time someone made a childhood story into a movie that adults can enjoy.  It met both my husband, and my own preferences for a movie.  It had the fantasy I enjoy and also some great gory killing moments for my husband.  All in all we both enjoyed this movie.
B0036S4B6M|2.0|Little disappointed. She reminds me of a spoiled rich girl who got caught.  She constantly reminds you she went to Smith and says she is educated.
B000TERI3O|5.0|Good music and just what I was looking for.  A great compilation of hits.  Music you are only going to get  by Merle Haggard.
B003G4W49C|5.0|What a great book! Reading Enders game for the third time made me realize what a masterpiece this book truly is. The story is so well put together that it is hard not to compare it with today's present time.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I'm just happy having a keyboard that can autocorrect my horrible writing. Being able to learn over time and pick up the words i use at work is just an added bonus
0446699616|3.0|I like Nelson DeMille but this book was too long and honestly the main character's continuous smart -- comments really wore thin.
B001BANK32|5.0|Tightly paced and solid characterization. Must-read for fans of horror and thrillers. This book is much better than the movie!
1434441636|1.0|I love this book. And ordered the physical book.<br />But in this copy, the reprint is very bad. It is crooked and faint.<br />The quality of paper is good, but the wording print is not even on a straight line, and look italic even though it is not.<br /><br />To keen buyers out there, please get another copy of this wonderful book instead of this reprint.<br />I am from Singapore, and it certainly make no sense for me to send this book (costing $4) back to Amazon.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's nice and different from typical games. It's a bit simple, but I enjoy it! Great for family use! There isn't any profanity, and the directions are easy to follow. The only thing is I wish I had a choice of which breed I was given. Other than that, I love it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game ever!!!! Everybody should download it!!!!!!!<br />Great game definitely appropriate for children I let my kids play it all the time. Love the game. Wonderful graphics! Great game.
0321934318|4.0|Another Scott Kelby success. Has a very practical approach which cuts through the technicalities and enables one to produce results.
0064471837|5.0|This book was introduced to me in my sophomore year in high school by my then best friend. I loved it so much, I almost didn't return the book to my friend! That was almost 15 years ago now. Every time I travel overseas, Sabriel is the one book I absolutely must have in my backpack. I am the kind of person who absolutely hates to rewatch a movie because I can still remember a plot, and the same applies to books. This book is the only exception to that rule.<br /><br />I have Lirael, Abhorsen, and Across the Wall and I tend to read those consecutively. I loved reading An Extract of the Journal of Idrach the Lesser Necromancer, heard about To Hold the Bridge but not sure how to find just that without buying the whole book. Absolutely cannot wait for Clariel, even if it's a prequel. September 2014 can't come soon enough!  ~Allie
B00CEZJT2E|3.0|A really nice looking battery pack--solidly built but three serious flaws.<br /><br />First,the battery pack controls the charging rather than lets the device you are charging to do the controlling. As a result, won't allow you to top off the device or to keep it at 100% during overnight charging. It required device to be significantly discharged before it starts the charging sequence. Then, charger turns off before device is fully charged and thereby doesn't keep it there when left plugged in overnight.<br /><br />Instruction sheet included with battery pack says that you can damage the charger if you leave it plugged in after it's fully charged. Therefore, battery pack doesn't have a protective circuit to prevent its own overcharging.<br /><br />Lastly, the chubby end of the built-in micro USB plug interferes with the most minimal of cases (Poetic case on an HTC One). If you don't remove the case, only plugs in partially and falls right out.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this battery pack but ended up sending it back.<br /><br />UPDATE: After returning this item and receiving a full refund, Anker, on their own, sent me a new battery pack--the 5600mAh model. It's working perfectly and is nice and compact. Doesn't have a built-in cord, unfortunately, but still better than the 6000mAh unit. Anker is a really great company when it comes to customer service!
B00ECU2SGS|3.0|OK story about two boys who befriend a stranger named Mud.  it's never made clear why Mud is hiding on the island or why the bad guys are after him.  Good photography though.  It got a 98% liked rating on Rotten Tomatoes.  Everyone in Arkansas must be voting for it continuously.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Season 2 is a gripping as Season 1 with many twists & turns but leaves you with a good feeling in the end.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I read this book in just one day because I couldn't put it down. I fell in love with the main characters so much so that I started talking and laughing out loud (my husband thought I was crazy). It was also a thought provoking book on a topic that is definitely controversial. I won't give away anything but along with being prepared to laugh and cheer for the characters make sure you have some Kleenex handy.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this great game reminds me of a game when I was younger I can't. put my finger on it, well I'll. ask my brother Mario when he calls me.  ha,ha.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|I picked this up to add wired network support to a Microsoft Surface Pro tablet when docked at my desk.  I'm running it through a HooToo® HT-UH001 SuperSpeed USB 3.0 7-Port Hub along with all of my other devices.  The device was recognized without installing any drivers and has performed perfectly for the two weeks I've owned it.  I haven't benchmarked it, but it is noticeably faster than my wireless connection.  I would recommend this to anyone needing to add a wired network connection.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I like any movie that is set in England and stars some very wonderful actors. In addition, the story was engaging and relatable and the music was wonderful. See it!
B001TH7GT6|5.0|High quality, low price, and does what it should.  It's exactly what I expect from the Amazon Basics electronics line.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Like the gradual buildup to loud and the large numbers. I can see the numbers with out my glasses on. I would recommend this app.
0375851569|5.0|C'mon, it's Dr. Seuss!  I grew up with him, my kids did, and now it's time for the grandkids.  Timeless, fantastic...
B00E0MCYPS|2.0|The title sums it up.  Racing games always seem like fun until you play them.  Gets an extra star for graphics.
B0091REZMW|5.0|love trying to get all the items and puzzle pieces. completing each task is fun and very challenging. it makes my brain work and keeps me trying to figure out how to get the next piece. LOVE IT.
B000MD7OKY|3.0|Excellent actors, great location shots, weak plot, some good dialogue but not enough, pedestrian directing by Hitchcock  who I think is vastly overrated.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|I followed instructions exactly how to use the and my kinect wouldn't work at all.  The second I took it off the kinect work so I thought I was doing it wrong did this a couple of times with the same results.  I would not recommend this item.  We ended up putting the kinect higher and that so far has seemed to work.
B003O86FMW|4.0|It is a good book to read, it could have ended a bit differently though. I would recommend this book.
B000I0XLYO|2.0|I watched this against my better judgement. There is nothing dumber than watching people being dumb....<br /><br />Were there laughs, yes a couple, but mostly just dumb is as dumb does... how any \\"famous\\" person was convinced to participate in this movie is beyond me... maybe just ego stroking.<br /><br />I suppose this would be a good movie to watch if you are having a booze party where the movie is just back-ground noise, but otherwise you may as well find something more worth your time, like a documentory on the many shades of pure black....<br /><br />Yeh, I know, that was dumb to say but, then the movie is still much much much worse.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|All the books in this series are good books to read, it would be a good to find more books like these
B00D3V5V7U|3.0|This album was everything I thought it would be. It's dark, heavy, and very straight forward. My two gripes are that there are some editing issues here and there throughout. The other, the band, especially Ozzy, really shows his age.  Lack of energy. If you do listen to this record, it needs to be at 11.
B005DJGMQE|5.0|This is a compelling story and has many great actors in the movie.  The backstory of Abraham Lincoln's assassination was complex and unsettling and this movie made it all seem so real.
B0049VZ222|5.0|This show is great. It's not all hype either. I really could care less about the whole zombie craze, but this series is more about survival... There just happens to be zombies in it. Watch this show.
B0002XH9Z4|3.0|Unfortunately, this was not packed very well for shipping, so the box holder got smashed in and one of the plastic CD holders busted.  Also the DVD seemed warped on the top.  Luckily it played on the computer alright.  On a more positive note, the CDs themselves looked brand new and the shipment arrived on time.
B00CWM3F4C|4.0|I honestly didn't care for this album when I first listened to it. However, the more I listen to it, the more I seen to like it. It really grows on you.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|This camera is fine for taking self pictures, but unlike the iPad, it only has one lens which does not allow you to see what you are taking a picture of if you face the lens towards another object.  This is disappointing.  Time to come out with a new version of Kindle that allows you to actually take photos.

B0047WJ12K|5.0|This is a great movie, if you haven't watched it already, DO IT!! It's absolutely brilliant! One of the best movies ever!
B000SEIDR0|5.0|Anything you didn't know(or wanna know) is in here..<br />Sometimes a bit elaborate but nevertheless scary..<br />I am not gonna say it changed my life but...just read it!! you'll see!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book left a lasting impression on me!  It brought home the message of the Golden Rule ans I will never forget it!
0345803485|3.0|Yes, I am guilty of reading the entire trilogy. As an observer of human behavior and an analyst, I needed to know why so many women were flipping, blushing, and obsessing over this book.<br />I found the writing primitive, redundant, and BORING, but I had to go on reading, however reluctantly, to make sure I didn't miss anything.<br />I have to give E.L. James credit for her creativity and the extensive research she had done to inject validity into her fanciful story.  It is not to say that sadomasochistic relationships are uncommon, but E.L. James, perhaps unintentionally, but nonetheless successfully, makes it all seem safe and acceptable by framing it in a tale of idealistic love, and sprinkling it with titillatingly resourceful eroticism to keep the reader inspired and longing.<br />At the end, I realized that the story resonated with women who craved to be loved by a man who could seduce them, take charge of their needs, and ultimately awaken their sexuality.  I had always believed that women were capable of enjoying their sexuality as men did.  Alas, E.L. James has cleverly seduced and introduced so many women to the ONE man who can release their sexual inhibitions and lead them to \\"ecstasy\\".
B004G600A4|5.0|We love this movie.  Its a great family movie. I have suggested it to friends and they love it too.  Its not just for kids.  Adults will love it too.
B006FK7SZ4|3.0|Has some good free features. Didn't offer any thing ground breaking. If you're in a small area like me, people on the site can be spread out.
B001O5LVPI|5.0|We love Lilo & Stitch.  My 4 year old boy and 2 year old girl would watch it everyday if I would let them.  When we were moving we misplaced the movie and we had to go out and buy a replacement.  We bought the blueray combo that has the second movie with it.  The disc itself works awful.  Constantly getting stuck in the blueray player.  And the second movie is okay, but the first is SO much better.  This movie is perfect and a good price.  I wish there was more merchandise to buy of Lilo and Stitch.

B003YTPS7O|5.0|There is so much going on here I had to see it twice to get most of it, and I still don't understand parts of it.  Maybe I need to read the book.  Unlike Blue Jasmine, this move leaves you feeling great.

B008JFUO4U|4.0|4 stars cause it's a little over the top...dont want to give it away but somethings don't seem right. Still Tom Cruise is good and the rather small cast of charectors do a decent job. Entertaining and the sound is great on a BluRay with a home theater system.

0380725398|5.0|Du Maurier can set a mood, draw you in and take you on a ride.  When you read fiction by a brilliant writer you have no idea if the book was written in 1936 or 2013.  I want to see the real Jamaica Inn after reading this story.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|I have purchased the MIB movies in multiple formats and now I have added them to my Blu-Ray collection.  These are a awesome set of movies.
0380778556|5.0|The writing is excellent and the story line keeps you in suspense.  After reading Du Mauier you know what a good writer can accomplish in creating the mood, bringing you into the setting and involving you in the characters.  I'll never forget Manderley.

B005GY0Y8S|1.0|I generally don't write bad reviews, but this one was so poorly written that I cannot believe it won an award.  Weak characters, relationships poorly handled, jumpy plot, too many things left unresolved. Was a waste of my time. Glad it had been a freeby. Sorry to have to say it, but wish I'd listened to the bad reviews before I'd bothered.

0064471837|5.0|The reason why I loved the Old Kingdom Trilogy when I first read it, and the reason why I still love it. Is that this series breaks so many stale conventions in fantasy in ways that are exciting and compelling.<br /><br />*Two of the strongest female protagonists I've seen in fantasy.<br /><br />Sabriel, and later on Lirael, are written with a sense of humanity. Not as accessories to a masculine power trip, not as a feminist dialectic. But as young women finding their place in the world, with all the beauty, texture and flaws you would expect from such characters.<br /><br />*A creative duality between technology and magic.<br /><br />A sophisticated lore pervades all of these novels that sets up and explores the ramifications of interaction between magic and technology. Similar themes are explored by the likes of Ian Irvine or Ragnar Tornquist to great effect. Indeed here, such themes form the basis of natural political conflict as well as dramatic consequence during the narrative.<br /><br />*A blurred line between good and evil.<br /><br />Most of the conflict in these books are centered around the idea of necromancy, magic to do with raising the dead. Traditionally the domain of villains, here we see it as a neutral force steeped in fascinating mythology and construct. Taking that gothic sort of Frankenstein story and mixing it with a concept of an Egyptian like afterlife. Combine this with the use of music, and you simply haven't seen magic that works like this before.<br /><br />*The best arcane library ever.<br /><br />I'm sure a lot of people who read this review probably hold a fantasy library special in their hearts. Whether the Unseen University of Discworld, or the Hogwarts School Library. The Library of the Clayr is one of the most richly descriptive and and compelling locations to ever be framed in a fantasy novel. If you love your library, this book will make you love it a little more!<br /><br />Garth Nix is honestly one of the most talented and refreshing writers in fantasy. If anything I've said sounds the slightest bit interesting, give these books a go, you're in for a treat.eshing writers in fantasy.

0316056898|5.0|This book was very well written. She combines humor and sensitive topics very well which allows for a good flow throughout the novel. She writes truthfully which makes for a good connection with her words and she talks about common things women around her age would have grown up with. This book is very suitable for anyone with a sense of humor! I really enjoyed this book and I hope everyone else will too!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I like it. It is advantageous!!!!!!!!  It has many different and fun stuff,games,and it looks like 3D!!!!!!!!! It's a cool game
B00BEYX7TW|5.0|great actors and great movie i was impressed, i will definitely recommend this movie to my friends and family. thank you
0062255657|4.0|Eccentric and beguiling - two of the characteristics that I could associate Neil Gaiman and this book with. Though this didn't appeal to me as much because it typically belongs on the super young section, I still loved the story's oddness; something I would give credit for.. Something that I have always been fascinated with.
6305622957|5.0|The historical accuracy of the film was most impressive to me.  It is a well made film that portrays the  different  factors that compelled Japan to attack the United States.

B00CSR2J9I|3.0|i loved this game for kindle fire but it stopped letting me play. i had gotten really far in the game and i was sad that i had to delete it to play. but about 2 days after i redownloaded it wouldnt let me play again!!! very disappointing.
0385342039|3.0|Another Sophie Kinsella stand-alone novel that I pretty sure did enjoyed too just like the others but The Undomestic Goddess still tops among her works for me.
B00E9PXI3S|2.0|Truly a terrible movie. Had no idea why this woman sleeps and wakes up all the time. I think the director was &#34;inspired&#34; by Deception. Anyway, the only shining point was Rachel McAdams. But the movie is not worth trying...
0380807343|4.0|Being able to watch the movie gave me much desire to read this because the movie was phenomenal for me! The movie was really good. :D I was able to watch the movie first before I got the chance to read this so I was able to skip the part of being all creeped out with the whole story. But the book is really good too. Perhaps, should I have been able to read this when I was much younger, this might have been part of my best list. But being an \\"eccentric-bizarre\\" fan myself, Neil Gaiman still never disappointed me with my \\"odd\\" whims.
B005SEZUJE|5.0|This show was so poorly marketed when it was on the air that I just dismissed it at the time.  But it is actually a really interesting and original concept, not what you would expect given the advertisements.  If you are a fan of good story telling and compelling concepts regarding the future of humanity, you owe it to yourself to give this show a watch.
0385342055|3.0|I was able to read the Confessions of a Shopaholic years ago and I wasn't able to finish the other parts after. I've always liked the fun, light readings of Sophie Kinsella so I decided to finish her Shopaholic series to give me a positive boost on my \\"freakish\\" month. :D It's nice to delve into feel-good-funny novels once in a while. :D

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I had to buy the book in paperback after reading on my kindle I love it that much!<br />What happens when two damaged people meet? They collide in a magnitude of emotions and explode. This book shows that. How you mess up, you hurt each other. No matter how hard to try, or you think your doing something for the other, you cant force things. Sometimes no matter how much you love someone it just doesn't work out. And sometimes no matter how much you try to pretend you don't love them, you cant stop.<br />Everyone should read this book. Period. The end.
B0031R5K72|4.0|I got to know of the book after watching its movie trailer recently. I had to read the book. Now I can't wait for the movie more!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Seems to be a tad predictable but a very good read none the less. Will finish series out as it'd is interesting
B008469DGY|4.0|This app requires little knowledge to play and is a fun version of golf.  It's a one stroke attempt at a hole in one, no putting or chipping involved, but it can provide some challenging shots.
B00114RKT8|5.0|This movie only reinforces this amazing hymn/song. The history behind the efforts taken to eliminate slavery in England and the slave trade.

B00BSBY38A|4.0|A wonderful story of struggle, survival, and the human spirit. PG rating makes it quality entertainment for most age groups.

B009NH6AOQ|5.0|For anyone who likes zombie movies, this entire series is a must have.  This show should set the standard for any zombie fare to come from now on.  No more tongue in cheek efforts or low budget crap for me...except those done so bad that you can laugh at them, (such as Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies).  Season Three of The Walking Dead is as good if not better than season 2, which is as good if not better than One.  Of course, I found season One to be outstanding!  I don't get cable tv, so I have to wait a whole year to see what happens in Season 4, but I'll bet it will be worth the long wait.  I haven't read the comics yet either.  The included extras are very entertaining as well, especially the added side video story of the Bicycle girl in Season Two.
0062511408|5.0|I read this book and English and loved it. I bought it in Spanish to share with my family so they could have a better understanding of it. The book opens up your eyes to the possibilities of life. It's a quick 200 and something page book that's easy to read and understand through the story of a shepherd. Definitely recommend for all readers.
0553593714|4.0|The book was very good but there were so many characters it was hard to follow. I'm sure the series will get better and better as I get more comfortable with who everybody is.
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|Outviews by Brandt Legg is an amazing story.  It's a mystery that never quits. I was hooked by the first couple of paragraphs and simply couldn't stop until I had finished.  Classified as visionary fiction it has all the hallmarks of a classic coming of age tale wrapped expertly in a paranormal tale reminiscent of Dean Knootz or an early Stephen King. Brandt's characters are deep, well thought out and skillfully blended together to keep the pages turning in this thrilling tale. Jk Rowling has nothing on Brandt Legg when it comes to weaving an intricate tale that will keep even the most critical of reader engrossed in the story. I look forward to Brandt Legg being a favorite writer of mine for years to come. Five Stars.<br />\\"For me writing allows my dreams or nightmares to see the light of day!\\"<br />---Author Cliff Roberts

1451695195|1.0|This is the most narcissistic, egocentric NDE \\"witness\\" I've ever had the displeasure to read about. It's more like an overview of his \\"experience\\" padded with pages and pages of blathering. If it were an option, this book and its author would have been awarded 0 stars. Biggest disappointment? I can never get back my time (a one sit read), wasted turning its pages. My advice? Read up on an author's reputation (and reviews), with regards to this and other similiar subjects before wasting your money and time. Sure wish I had done so with this author because the only \\"proof\\" he offers is his word.
B00D2K40WY|3.0|GOOD game but I would not say that it is a great game. Good game but now stellar game to end all games
B001FES0IE|3.0|I love the music but the warped album was a surprise. I have a very high end system so it plays okay but was expecting better quality control that prevented the warping.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|As a pet owner, you always wonder what your pet is thinking and how much they really know.  This books takes you inside the mind of a dog and how 'he' views his family and life.

B00498YZH8|5.0|Jennifer Lawrence is my favorite actress! I have yet to find a movie I don't like that she's been in. This movie had a right amount of heart and drama to make it one of my favorites! Worth the purchase, either for rental or DVD.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Cool game. Can't wait to try part 2. If you like hidden object games this is a good one. Give it a try.
030746363X|5.0|This book has an amazing amount of information. These fields of information are always advancing fast so some of the information can be a little out of date. Such as it is probably a good idea not to try the daily sleep cycle of 6 20 minute naps a day. But still interesting and provided motivation for me to look more at current studies on naps which is very interesting.<br />This book was a very fun  read for me. Fascinating information.<br /><br />A little about me. I am now 58 and was looking to recover some health and lose some weight. I have successfully used the Atkins diet to lose 55 pounds down to 158 at 6'1\\". However due to a health problem I gained it all back. I have since come to the belief that it is not good to do such diets over and over. I have also been into fitness since I was a teenager. Boxing, karate, yoga, gymnastics, bodybuilding and weightlifting.<br />I got a few nuggets out of this book that were very worthwhile. the slow carb information was great. Using this and a once in awhile cheat day and using the minimum amount needed to put on some muscle I have lost 30 pounds in less than 5  months and also put on some good solid muscle. My wife was very surprised I was able to do this. I am now 183 pounds and must turned 58. utilizing slow carbs to  not be carb starved has been great and is the  missing piece to the controlled carb diets. I just use what seems like okay portions and don't count anything. Due to hip and knee issues I swim and machine bicycle. For swimming I use 'Snorkle Bobs' Moflo2 snorkel as I don't like swallowing pool water, and wanted more oxygen than a regular snorkle provides (dead air space) as I am training for my general health. However this snorkel does leak some but a forcefull outward breath now and then while swimming clears it out no problem. As for working with weights the Colorado experiment I believe was totally true and the key part for us mere mortals is to not over train.I bought a few more books here on HIT (high intensity training) and for me a 20 minute workout twice a week has worked great. I have shown steady strength and muscle gain. Plenty for me as I am really looking for healthy maintainable muscle size for the long run. I also just started alternate day fasting experimentation which he also talks about under living forever and life extension. A free kindle book The IF Diet speaks more to this. Great stuff and I have hopes for this. At my age being within my BMI and fitness and health is most important in my opinion.<br />This has been a great book with a wealth of information. My only complaint is you should get a free kindle edition as there is so  much information that it is hard to put this into a plan for yourself health wise and it is a little hard to skip around finding what you want But there is so much great information for such a reasonable price that it deserves no less than 5 stars.<br />As a small reward thing the looks I got at the pool on vacation felt great. Hawaii and Vegas both.<br />For my weightlifting purpose just do 1 set each movement with good form and full range of motion to failure twice a week or once every 4 days. sometimes 3 days and sometimes 5 days. Do a cardio workout or at least a 10 minute cool down cardio workout of some kind after lifting weights to avoid artery hardening as recent research shows. No one knows why yet. Listen to your body and if some joint starts hurting then change the exercise and/or your way you do the exercise.<br />There is so much fun information and inspiration that my review cannot really do it justice.<br />If you are looking for a fun inspirational read to get you going on your own health program again this could be it for you.
B0018PH3L0|1.0|The packaging has a closed captioned logo on the back. I bought it at Walmart, not amazon. Here on Amazon, the product description doesn't mention closed captioning, only the dubbing. Since I'm hearing impaired, the DVDs are worthless to me. This mini-series is one of my favorites. It's dubbed in other languages. HUH??? Can someone help me out and tell me if their version is closed captioned? I'd like a widescreen closed captioned version of this fine mini series, full screen if that's the only closed caption one available. I'm not trusting the product description at this point. No stars would be more appropriate since I can't enjoy it whatsoever.
B00B32X786|3.0|Lots of big names in this pic but that didn't keep it from dragging in parts.  It was interesting enough to keep my attention, though.  My favorite part was when Rosie was in the grocery store shopping with the two guys following along behind her and she did a whole monologue about men and their proclivity for beautiful girls.  Pretty funny stuff.  There's a young Natalie Portman doing a great job acting in this, but the dynamics between her character and the main character creeped me out a bit.  I understood what she represented to him in the movie, but it was still a little &#34;pedophilic&#34;.<br />Overall, I don't regret watching it, but I wouldn't do it again.
B00AW57L96|3.0|I was engrossed with this story for a start but as it progressed I lost interest and found the second half monotonous and somehow it lost its momentum.
B00D8RYV52|1.0|I tried to open it up but it just went back to the store I'll try it daily to see if it will work but it was disappointing  having to spend my money that way.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|I was captivated from the first page with this delightful story told in a simple but eloquent way.  Having travelled extensively through England I could imagine all the places and felt the pain Harold felt with his feet.  The incredible power of the human mind was evident and I will read this again and again.

B00CATSONE|5.0|Very interesting book which tells the real history of the AC/DC competion.  Without Paul Tesla we would still be in the dark ages.
B004EPYZXU|4.0|Finished watching this just now, on a slight binge of watching mildly scary horror movies that aren't particularly good.  I've little knowledge on astronaut training or if it's in any way similar to the military, (nor any real modern military knowledge) so I can't vouch for whether the characters were particularly authentic in their speech or demeanor, but overall it was fun, \\"atmospheric\\" and thrilling.<br /><br />The only flaw I find would be the end sequence which, without spoiling, suffered from a bit too much in the way of talking.  Not quite exposition, but it felt similar to it, with an awful lot of dumb \\"YOU KNEW!\\" shouts.  The vast majority of it works when there's little to no dialogue.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|OK movie, but the actors seemed stiff and the plot was predictable. Even Tom Cruise could not save the movie.
B000QRIGJY|5.0|Fast paced and s leg up on past Bosch novels. This is a different side of Bosch and really emphasizes the lone wolf inside of him! 5 Stars!!!
0679882820|5.0|This is an edited version of the original book.  It's still great.  The board book is perfect for my toddler who loves to make the noises that mr brown makes
B003WUYRGI|4.0|When I'm annoyed by a friend's sibling I can just search the word they are. :-)<br />And also this book is annoying
0671449028|3.0|Bought this because my daughter loves &#34;Barnyard Dance&#34;.  This is not nearly as good of a book.  It's good, but not great.  If I only purchased one of her books, it would definitely be &#34;barnyard dance.&#34;
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I was in tears at the end of this book. This story reminded me of that first teenage love and how magical it can feel, and I almost forgot at times that the characters were ill. I would definitely recommend this book.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|David Tennant will always be my favorite Doctor.  The writing and the other actors who have accompanied him on his journey and been great.  As always . . . . you can count on British TV to keep you entertained.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This is very much like Garden Spells but slightly darker. Not your conventional happy ever after but good nonetheless. I couldn't put it down, but left slightly unsatisfied, and I can't put my finger on why.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Once again British TV has rocked it.  The actors and the story draw you in and leave you breathless and wanting more.  I hope there will be more of Broadchurch once this story has ended.  There has to be!!!
1594746036|4.0|The best part of Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is the authentic old photographs. Ransom Riggs creating a story that connects all of the odd photos and odd people in the photos is brilliant. That said, I thought the story was good, but not great. It was tense and scary, but also dragged in parts. The children from the Home were very one dimensional, but the protagonist was a realistic, confused teen on a quest to keep a promise made to his beloved grandfather. I liked how the reader doesn't know until well into the book if it is going to be a ghost story, fantasy or suspense thriller, but the ending was contrived and obviously set up for a sequel. Tim Burton is making the movie.
1612680011|4.0|Funny but precise, an excellent point of view, Anyone looking for being a businessman should read. It explains a lot of things that were beyond my understanding.
0385736002|4.0|The Alchemyst is a great choice for readers who like books that start out with a bang - No really, it starts out with a huge explosion and the action never slows down. Although I enjoyed reading the Alchemyst, it is a pretty formulaic fantasy quest, save the world YA novel. Its plot is a little more complex than most in the fantasy genre, which I appreciated, but the characters are fairly one dimensional and predictable. Since formulaic and predictable do not bother fans of YA fantasy, the Alchemyst and its sequels are hugely a popular. Don't understand why the series has not been discovered by Hollywood.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I loved this game.  It is challenging and offers many hours of fun.  The graphics are amazing.  I will definitely buy  more games from this publisher.
B000MV9026|4.0|My Grand Daughter thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this movie.  It made a good baby sitter.  I would recommend it.
B00CEQ1HOQ|5.0|Exactly as described. 7 year old daughter loves it. This one is one of my faves too. Love her colors!
B00D7NWTSI|5.0|Bringing comic book adaptations to life on screen seems to be a difficult balance for anyone that's not Marvel it would seem. Could they do it again here? The answer to that is a resounding YES! Other studios and some directors think that translating content which is mostly successful on paper through to a live action takes some extra clever handling or major changes. Marvel knows that nothing could be farther from the truth. Trust the material for the most part and the movie will blossom. Sure, Marvel can change and adapt within their own universe when the need arises. The Mandarin in this very film is the perfect example of change done right. Mandarin needed more than a tweak to work on film and what they crafted here was brilliant. Thankfully, director Shane Black and Marvel worked well together because the team up resulted in a film true to Marvel's heritage but also something new and fresh.<br /><br />Iron Man 3 is a fun big-screen blockbuster with heart but also brains. It's smart and benefits from an amazing screenplay. It wonderfully blends experienced, award winning actors with a balanced mix of story and action. The comedy works so well on many levels. There's the \\"hit you over the head\\" type humor and then there's the drier, sarcastic comedy that Robert Downey was born to deliver. Everything meshes here for one of the better film going experiences of the year.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|really time consuming! love the fact u can play with friends or against the Cpu.  long games arencommo. with ranked players
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I have loved this trilogy.  A tremendous love story well written with depth and expertise.  I fell in love with both Christian and Ana.  Not trusting a happy ever after kept me as insecure and emotional as they were.  It made me feel closer to them and their story.  Definitely a keeper for rereading.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|You'll laugh, you'll cry. This book really draws you in and brings the characters to life. Read it, you'll love it.
B00BXLU1EU|1.0|It says what it's like and it was a big waste of time and crash the applications and still won't do
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Excellent......can't wait to see the book turned into a movie later this fall.......money very well spent......loved this story<br /><br />Buy it already
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I was doubtful but I downloaded the Kindle for Android to my cheap tablet and it not only works but it will synchronize with other Kindles/computers so that you can start reading where you left off on any kindle software.  Works like a charm and gives me the same font/lighting options.  I'd recommend this to anyone that likes to read.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is a great series! Suzanne Collins is great!! I can not wait for the movies to come out, even though they are never as good as the books!!
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Probably not going to win an oscar but good movie overall, kept me engaged throughout and I totally didnt see the ending coming.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|A great story, timeless and full of heart. Many questions are left unanswered but this is one of those rare times that I actually like it. It's a trick of your memory trying to remember the past, remembering the fondness, and forgetting the bad.
B00DU74U74|4.0|The beginning was really slow for me personally, not a lot happening, even the start of the story was confusing and lackluster but after about midway, it got much better.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I generally abhor self help books. This one? This makes a difference in every single relationship you have. Once you can speak the language your partner speaks, communication is a breeze
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|very good movie, loved the costumes, the settings, the story line held your attention, you found yourself wraped up in it
B004J4WKTW|3.0|This is well written, but I didn't fall in love with the subject matter. I would definitely read other books from this author
B00BEIYL6G|4.0|\\"Jobs\\" is a biographical drama film based on Apple Computer co-founder and I.T. innovator Steve Jobs.<br /><br />The narrative takes various extracts from Jobs' life, but the main focus of the story is set from the mid-1970s to mid-1980s.<br /><br />Jobs (Aston Kutcher) is presented with some idiosyncrasies such as the stoop of his walk, his endless drive for perfection, displaying an own boss mentality in appropriate and also inappropriate situations, and in some instances demonstrating ruthlessness towards life and business.<br /><br />The transition of the narrative from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s was abrupt, which could cause some confusion for viewers as to how Jobs has found himself in such a new situation. The viewer though can make reasonable assumptions, but a few extra scenes or flashes of events could have gone a way to eliminate any possible misunderstandings.<br /><br />Apple's reinvention as a company and subsequent breakthrough products could have also benefited from a few more scenes or a highlights reel of key events in the 2000s up until its 2012 market leading valuation. Therefore if the running time of the film was increased by eight minutes (making the total 130 minutes) this could have eliminated some gaps in the narrative. That said the movie does present many exciting, anxious and satisfying stages in the evolution of Apple and also the personal growth and development of Steve Jobs.<br /><br />The film was well acted and the costume and set designs takes the viewer back to the 1970s and 80s with some decent authenticity.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author
B00BE97ONM|1.0|This books starts off with a mechanical type of reading. Like every word was hard to write.  No free flowing. The writer seemed to have a hard time keeping the story interesting.<br />Only had gotten to chapter 6. Couldn't take it any more.
B0051SDM5Q|5.0|I learned a lot and enjoyed reading this book, which is a nice combination. I have also read other books and scholarly articles that reference these authors repeatedly, so it makes me feel like these ones are pretty credible
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|I like it so much. I found the story interesting and well written. In the future, I would like to see more movies like this movie.
B000OYC7A8|3.0|Good dvd if only for pink floyd or david gilmour nostalgia. Too much smoke! This caused visualization issues. I dont understand why david crosby and graham nash were part (very small) of this. Love Gilmour...hate the on stage smoke. David Bowey was impressive. Good dvd for crazy P.F. fans like myself...have to own all cds and dvds by these icons.On a 10 scale...give it a7.5.
1616550414|4.0|this is really cool. anybody loving the world of The Legend of Zelda is going to love this book. Even bought a couple for other people
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Ive played it on a friends iPhone and I enjoy it alot. Now that ive found it here im really excited. Some of tye physics are iffy but an all around awesome game.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I have always loved these books and as long as Rick makes books I'll read them. Four more words yeah.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|i am in love with this series. This book Amazing even better than the first. I am dying waiting for the next one that doesn't came out till 2014! Ahhhhhh.
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|Its okay, for a copycat movie, but I just would not be able to say much more than that; period.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a fun and addictive game fun for all ages if you are looking for something to entertain you or a child get this app
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|The is the best racing game ever the graphics r amazing and the online racing only boost the the things to do I would recommend this game to anybody
B004UID2LC|2.0|I was sincerely happy when I first got this, but my Kindle started to slow down and it wouldn't allow me to delete it. So I used my file manager and deleted the files from my Kindle then I deleted the app now my Kindle is running as quick as it used to.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|I'm struggling to find the words. Put it this way, I shouldn't have watched the original version (with Robert Redford and Mia Farrow) right before watching this version. There is no justice to the book or the original movie. I felt like I was watching a cartoon. It was so bad I couldn't finish it. I was at least expecting the visuals to exceed the original, but it just came off as harsh. No subtlety or beauty. It was a total trash effort of a classic book and the original film. Very, very disappointing. Don't waste your time on this. Watch the original movie again, or just read the book. SO much better than this effort.
B00CJKW4WQ|3.0|so far looks real nice next to my I mac, works good as far as blue tooth hook up, I wanted it to use as a regular calculator, only thing I do not like is I figured it would have the multiplication symbol and division as well, I will have to tinker around with it a little to see how it works, and I will update my findings, It is a good looking calculator,update 09-15-2013 this is a nice looking calculator, thats about it, I have messed with this smart calculator and I do not like it, I can not get it to work properly, all in all to me its a waste of money, I will purchase another type that works like a regular calculator should, I am not gonna waste my time sending it back, I will just chock it up for a loss, no biggie, maybe this one is defective, all I can say is it's pretty!
B00E978FGQ|1.0|The movie had me going for about an hour and then I realized the movie had no idea where it was going. They left too many things unexplained and it's just not plausible. They didn't explain some of the important points and the ending just left more questions.<br /><br />If you're the type of person who likes your movie flashy that make little sense, this is one for you.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a cool game and very fun to play..... it is better than temple run.....I love it a lot I play it all the time. I rate it like 5 stars
B0011MRKHW|5.0|Queen Liz was trapped by her obligations!! Being a bondservant to The LORD & a crown couldn't have been easy. Pretty good, Shakur.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Did everything you would expect. it could have more than 1 song to set for alarm. Worth having for travel.
B00BE97ONM|5.0|From page one, this book had me hooked. This is a dark story, full of pain and anger, with brilliant and devious characters, to make this one of the best thrillers I've read this year.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Several friends are avid fans so I decided I needed to catch up if  I wanted to be a part of their conversations. Love it!
B00EBBQXZ0|5.0|An excellent look at the 1983 Al Pacino movie. I wish there were more quality film books like this. The 5 star reviews are all accurate: this is absolutely a must have for film lovers. Very well done.
B003G4W49C|5.0|With the movie coming out shortly, this is a must have for your book shelves (virtual or otherwise). Orson is an amazing story teller, and this story is an epic that stretches across time and space, crossing and joining emotional boundaries and spiritual concepts in the wake. One of my most favorite stories of all.
B00CEF014E|5.0|I loved this. My heart was in my mouth as I turned the pages and I didn't notice the time go by. The twist was great. I am anxious to read more by this author. I wish it was longer. Is there a sequel?
B0054R6BFM|1.0|I'm not a proffesional critic, as I'm in my early teens. I don't have a grand intro to this review, but what I can say is that this book was a personal letdown.<br /><br />I heard so much hype over this book that I HAD to read it, and read it I did.<br />Starting off with the double narration, I was quite pleased with how it was portrayed. I was a little confused at first, but I caught on quickly. But the whole leadup to what Clay was going to be held accountable for was just boring and I found myself groaning and rolling my eyes when it showed that he really didn't do ANYTHING!!<br /><br />The placement of the character of Clay's mother was a little more than awkward for me. She didn't serve a necessary purpose and just seemed too extraneous.<br /><br />Suicide is a very heavy topic, and some authors portray it in their stories very well. But with this story, I just wasn't impressed and I failed to see the heartbreaking beauty of this book. Would I recommend it? No.
140006922X|5.0|Having read Aslan's \\"How to Win a Cosmic War,\\" I had high expectations for this book, and I wasn't disappointed. Reza Aslan brings his research skills to recreate a picture of the world in which Jesus lived, showing the fallacy of what is taught as literal truth in much of Christianity. The tiny country of Palestine is occupied by a powerful Rome where Jewish insurgents regularly rose up against their oppressors and where many of the Jewish elite, especially the priests of the temple, make their peace with the occupiers by exploiting their own people.<br /><br />Not until Rome burned the temple to the ground and destroyed Jerusalem and most of surrounding countryside sending most Jews into exile, did the writers of the New Testament begin to create the mythology that became Jesus the Christ. Decades after the death of Jesus,these writers, many of them living in Greece and, who had never known Jesus, told the story as they, themselves, saw and chose to believe it.<br /><br />The question becomes: Can Christian believers come to terms with the probable origins of their religion and still be loyal to what the church has become today?
B00005JMXX|5.0|This is a great movie! im a huge fan of most of the talent in this movie! This should have won a ton of awards!
B001CTGQBK|5.0|Of course I'm giving this 5 stars.  Best fun 50s musical movie.  Love Olivia Newton John and John Travolta and an amazing supporting cast.
B00422LESO|4.0|I enjoyed the story, having a Mr. Darcy crush myself. Sometimes it seemed slow,gently plodding at a steady pace but entertaining enough to keep my interest. Most of the book felt predictable but I LOVED the end. The truth about who was acting and who wasn't, was worth the wait and the ending was exactly what I wanted, without even knowing it possible. I suppose it helped me remember to keep myself open to all possibilities because the unexpected are the best kind. Enjoy!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|After reading the first book I was hooked.  I had to find out what was next for Christian and Ana!
B0064MGU98|3.0|It's a reasonably good show, on the order of Law and Oder. Developing an affinity for the characters is what will carry you from episode to episode.the Good Wife is a watchable legal drama.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|After reading the first two books of the trilogy I was hooked.  I had to continue.  I loved how Christian and Ana's relationship develops throughout the 3 books.  I am eagerly waiting for the next book in the series.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|Really enjoyed the book! It was really well written and I kept wanting to read it till it was finished!!!
B00ANTX3HA|4.0|But did our &#34;leaders&#34; learn from it?<br /><br />Something that stuck with me, and overshadowed everything else McNamara said in this film was (paraphrased) &#34;if you don't like the question, answer with what you wanted to hear&#34;.<br /><br />Even so many decades after Vietnam, the hubris still shows.
B005UT29Z0|1.0|Something bad is going on, the result will be horrible, lots of people will be fired and a few will make a sinful amount of money, but nowhere is it explained what the heck it is. The acting, even Kevin Spacey's, was mediocre at best. And then there was<br />Demi Moore!  I think they brought her in because of her role in Disclosure, but in this movie she merely behaves like a bimbo in a skirt way too short for her age. If this had been recorded on film, it would have been a tragic waste of celluloid!
B0089LOG02|2.0|It started off good and then something just went wrong.  there were many things in this story that didn't ring true.  our book club read it and we all were rather disappointed.
B006GECE9Y|5.0|This mobile browser is packed with features and runs smoothly. I would recommend this browser to anyone looking for an easy to use browser.
B009RX8MQ0|4.0|I haven't enjoyed a tv show this much in years. It's in my TOP 5 but I won't be buying this second season because first it has no special features and most of all, I want it on Blu ray. Why is this show not on Blu Ray? Will I hv to wait for the box set?
B0079IEPHA|5.0|The actors are great and the story lines are interesting.  Harvey is a brain with balls!  Can't wait for season 3 on DVD!
B00E0MCYPS|5.0|Amazon free download.  I have a kindle fire hd 7.  The control issues he can be solved by going into settings and scroll through the view options.  I found it helped to turn the auto gas check box off.  This allows you to lift and keep your car at a constant speed.  It also allows you to feather the throttle through the corners resulting in some cool slides.  Great game.
1934030554|5.0|Exactly what my husband was looking for in a power meter book. Easy to follow and lots of information to boot.
B008469DGY|5.0|This a really great game to pass time...works great on my Fire HD...not a golf course game, but a fun way to use your skills playing golf to see if you can better your best score....like the incentives to score higher and open new courses...hope they make it bigger....<br />Thanks
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this app is one of the best apps you will ever get! it has really good animations! My faviorite thing about it is that you go to diffrent places
B002SKZBQS|4.0|S. King's strong point is wonderful, complicated characters, although I kind of understood this one, I didn't completely agree with his way of handling things. Made a very good, tingly read.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game makes you feel like your taking care of an actual horse. This game is so fun plus its free
B007THA4FI|4.0|Interesting, good characters, did leave you hanging a bit at the end, could have used some closer on some of the issues at the end of the book
B0061QD82E|5.0|How can you beat a classic such as this. Such a wonderful story and great characters. Will watch this on occasion until I can no longer.
B008469DGY|5.0|Game play is excellent, very fun to play. The only thing I wish it had more of is the tour levels. I like the 9 shot high score challenge. Would recommend to anyone tho!
B0087ITBPC|4.0|Good story and acting. This is not a movie for someone who is worried about guessing the plot though. I enjoyed it.
B00AYHKIZ6|3.0|This album is as lame as Never Let Me Down. Maybe six songs are good and one is the instrumental. I also fast forward  some of the songs. Just not a good Bowie album after a 10 year wait
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I enjoyed reading E2 as it was a practical book on how to use the power of the universe. Thank you Pam xo
140006922X|2.0|Although the book delivered on explaining the 'time' of Jesus, I didn't feel that it had any more insight into the 'life' of Jesus than is common knowledge. The author clearly wanted to paint Jesus as no more significant than any other traveling magician in early Palestine. I was disappointed in how the book played out, as I was expecting more about who Jesus was,
B00CSYRHG6|5.0|This was wonderful, really loved the story and animation of it. Great addition to my Studio Ghibli movie collection! Looking forward to the other two historical types that are coming out soon from Ghibli as well.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|A story with so much \\"depth\\" you are not aware of; the more you read, the more you want to \\"understand,\\" seeking answers to questions not clear. My goodness, Christina McKenna, thank you for a great read!
B00B4VXQC8|1.0|I don't do a whole lot of reviews on Amazon for two reasons... One is because I really believe that almost everything (not just music) is subjective and that opinions are opinions. Two is because I write about music for a living.... So it's hard for me to justify doing this without being paid for it.  But I need to add that nearly all the time, I CHOOSE the musicians that I write about. Once in awhile, an artist or album comes along that I feel compelled to discuss but who I really dislike, so I would never choose to write about them.<br /><br />Bon Jovi is one of those artists. I've never liked him or his band -- either musically or personally (I've known several people in the business who have worked with Jon and I've obviously seen him interviewed). He's not really a musician; he's a businessman. He's also an arrogant guy who has even admitted that he cheats on his wife and who (let's be honest) would have been relegated to 15 minutes of fame at most if he didn't have two things going for him: good looks and an uncle who was a famous record producer.<br /><br />But getting back to the music...  For the past 25 years (or a little more), he's been turning out crap that is designed to get girls (and occasionally boys) in suburban America to wave their lighters and to wring emotion out of people with subpar intelligence.  To his credit, it's worked! Bon Jovi's music is basically average-to-poor arena rock. Nothing wrong with you if that's your thing, by the way -- but even in that genre, you can do better. Def Leppard, for example, do this sort of thing better than Bon Jovi, plus they're nicer guys. Jovi himself is a poor, heavy-handed singer who constantly over-emotes in an attempt to sound \\"soulful\\"; an adequate axeman at best (the main guitar chops in the band belong to Richie Sambora);  and a horrible songwriter. One of his main problems in the writing area is a shortage of original ideas. He isn't exactly visionary as a lyricist (to put it mildly!) and even thetitles of some of his best known songs were stolen from other artists. In fact, that's what promoted me to write this review; today happens to be the 10th anniversary of the death of Warren Zevon, the talented but self-destructive singer-songwriter best known for \\"Werewolves of London.\\" A number of years ago, Jon Bon Jovi had a hit called \\"I'll Sleep When I'm Dead.\\" I'm sure he made a lot more money off that song than Zevon made off HIS \\"I'll Sleep When I'm Dead,\\" which was recorded in 1976 and was one of his best early rockers.<br /><br />I could go on and on but if you've read this far, you get the point... On his latest album, Jovi isn't really doing anything new and he's not very good at what he's been doing for all these years to begin with. Everyone's entitled to their opinion and you're certainly entitled to disagree with mine.... but if you do it here, you'd better have something to back it up with. It's not enough to say \\"But millions of people buy Bon Jovi records!\\"  Millions of people followed Hitler too...
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|this has to be one of the worst movies the actors should all be made to give back whatever they were paid and to apologize for this thing<br />so this is the more words requried by amazon to post review should be able to just say it works or doesn't
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Good suspense, good character development. Good plot lines. Story lines a well made and each episode keeps you wondering what will happen next.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|great story and cast<br />thank God the incredible boring pedantic  over stuffed mr hoffman was behind the camera<br />so this is the more words requried by amazon to post review should be able to just say it works or doesn't
B00D8HNR2K|4.0|To put this album down for not being angry or aggressive enough is short sighted.  I love it when bands use guitars and instruments in unconventional ways to create atmosphere. The blend with heavy bass beats, beautiful synth/piano melodies, psychedelic sonic assaults... I like every song on it with Everything being my least favorite for now but it's still a cool song with some traces of The Cure which is awesome.  I don't find the songs repetitive because I hear things building up, it doesn't feel like a formula.  Actually I wish this had like 2 more tracks, it feels too short when you realize the album ends.  Probably NIN's best since *Year Zero.<br /><br />* one year later, maybe an 8/10.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Fun read. Way to many &#34;Oh My's&#34; and repetitive sex scenes. Makes the feminist in me want to bitch slap both Anastasia and<br />Christian. A redeeming quality  is the character arc in both of them however, transcending some of their stupidness. But for some reason, I just kept reading these until it was done, so there is some chemistry.
B0080SZ0V8|3.0|I really like this game but I am stuck on the library puzzle as nothing happens when you touch the coordinates on the map. Can anyone give me a clue.
B00C7JFIRC|5.0|This is a very awesome remake.. If you liked the original then you will like this version. I would recommend this movie.
B00006ADD5|2.0|Count me among the apparently clueless rabble who find this movie extremely overrated.  One of the few film 'classics' that just doesn't appeal to me at all for some reason.
B003L1ZWG2|5.0|I liked this movie and it is always better in Blu-ray and as usual it arrived right on time.. I would recommend this movie..
B00CUIVGZS|4.0|I think &#34;The Vigil&#34; was vintage Chick Chorea,&#34; (you've misspelled his name above), with a look backwards to &#34;Return to Forever&#34; and the future with his last Gary Burton/CC albums. I gave him four stars because the playing and arrangements are all accomplished, but some of them to reminiscent of what he's already done in spades. Needless to say his chops are magnificent as always, he looks good physically, which is heartening, after losing a good deal of weight. My suggestion would be that he explore playing trio again, to cut down the number of keyboards and let the acoustic piano shine. Teamed up with a great bass player and drummer, he'd have more freedom to go deeper into his feelings and produce jazz that's more personal. Aside from that, I thought the CD graphics were a little bizarre as was the title, &#34;The Vigil&#34;. It's a bit pompous. Bottom line, Chorea remains one of my favorite players, but I think he has and could do better with less and a sparer sound.<br />Jerry Mazza,<br />gvmaz@verizon.net<br />P.S. Amazon could use spellcheck in this review box.
B00A9ET4MC|4.0|Adichie's novel presents her readers with so many insights relating to race, history, class while cloaking them in captivating stories of the lives of her characters.
0425263908|5.0|This book is hot. It is intense and romantic too but i liked it  better than the other one because this one has sex but also a story behind it. I felt with the other one like they only had sex all the time and nothing else. Heresies feelings. Way better!!!!
B004FKGX8Y|5.0|This is a great edition of Inception, as I really enjoyed the movie and have always wanted the three disc steelbook edition and haven't been able to locate it in the UK. It is a fantastic addition to my collection of steelbooks and I am very happy to own it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is one of the best books I have in a long time.  It makes me wish I had a Christian Grey.  Once you get to know him you understand why he needs to have the control and the challenge.
159463176X|5.0|A wonderful group of stories about the Afghan culture and the connectedness of everything and each of us.  Brilliantly told!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I think that my five star rating says it all.  You can feel the love growing in the trust that he is placing in Miss Stleele.  You could tell from the first book that Miss Steele was already in love with Mr Grey she just needed to understand the hurt that he felt.
B0082Z447U|5.0|I could not put it down.  Now I rush to my Kindle to buy another Wilkie Collins book. You should do the same!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This game is a great way to avoid doing housework. More fun with lots of friends. Just wish it didn't freeze so often.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Very enjoyable and hard to put down! One of the classics that should be read at school.  Hard to believe that this was written such a long time ago.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|WOW! What an outstanding book.  This was such a good story.  The meaning of the key was so sad and the hunt was so &#34;edge of your seat&#34;.  The relationships that were formed and the ending were extremely interesting and warm.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great app!Absolutely love it!So does my sister!It's so funny and fun to play too! Can't wait to get new bonuses!
B00BE97ONM|5.0|Son of a Serial Killer is a well-told story of a young man in the depths of despair, being forced to do bad things, by the voice in his head and as a reaction to the actions of others around him.<br /><br />The author did a great job at conveying the character's inner most thoughts and fears. The plot was strong and the writing flowed well.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I love this cute game!You can buy your own pets and build your own houses!GET THIS APP NOW!!!!!!I would recommend this to anyone and everyone!
B00BQ1S0OU|5.0|Jane Hayes is a early 30′s single woman in Manhattan.  She numbers her previous relationships, referring to them as Boyfriend #1, and so on.  No real life man can compare to her dream of Mr. Darcy as played by Colin Firth in the BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice.  When her aging great aunt discovers this obsession, she confesses that her expectations led her to not appreciate the great man she was married to.  Upon her death, she wills to Jane a 3-week vacation to an English resort that reenacts the perfect Regency-era in costumes, etiquette and entertainment.<br /><br />The owner of the resort has a creepy amount of information on the guests, and Jane is deemed a lower status due to her \\"economic conditions\\".  Austenland is cute, funny, and surprisingly relatable. I struggle with knowing the intentions of the resort itself.  Is it arranging relationships for these dreamy women?  Or just a lively experience?  I would highly recommend this book to anyone, especially to read it before you see the movie!<br /><br />Austenland by Shannon Hale: I give it 4/5 Stars
B0039208JE|5.0|Just a quickie review - bought this last week in the blu-ray steel book version.  TONS of cool features including Tim Burton commentary - STUNNING picture (best ever) and awesome Super HD 5.1 audio mix which makes great use of the rear speakers.  Amazing edition of an amazing movie.
B001S86J0I|5.0|great movie that you must see to understand and enjoy.. very well-done! where it can viewed as a spoof, it also is great as a stand-alone film in its own right.
B003U4UPHG|5.0|Awesome series!  Love the mystery and constant questions...just when one gets answered, three more are posed! Great characters, great story, what more could you want?!?
B00DEG4Z1W|2.0|When I got this it started glitching on me. And the pictures for the came are impossible to make. So it's fine
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Could not watch them one by one. Had to devour in a few sittings. If a fan you wont be disappointed.

B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Aside from solving puzzles, failing to solve puzzles is fun, too. There is something about the animation--maybe the shocked look on the monsters' faces--that makes the game fun to lose.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|The knife came a day early for starters. Came razor sharp. SOLID knife very well made. The sheath is good, floppy belt loop makes it not great. No defects. A must buy for camping and survival. This thing is a beast of a knife. Feels awesome in the hand and doesn't move or slide at all. 5 out of 5 for me.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great for the kids! They all Love it either grooming or feeding or competing. It gets boring after a while though the kids play with it happily.
B00CTSDDVO|1.0|FIVE stars for the movie however the DVD release is a slap in the face of all Paramount's devoted Star Trek fans...a real rip-off...<br />I just cancelled my 3 month old Amazon.com pre-order for Star Trek Into Darkness (Blu-ray 3D + Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy) on 9/6 because 1) it hadn't been shipped yet and was scheduled to arrive at least a week AFTER the release AND (moreso) that Paramount is screwing us all over by releasing over half of the special features as \\"retailer exclusives\\" (half by Target, half by Best Buy) and the commentary by J.J.Abrams can ONLY be had via a special ITunes download (played separately from the full priced movie you have to buy). In order to get all the exclusives you'd need to spend well over $100 for each version. So I've decided not to buy any of these stripped versions and wait for the \\"platinum\\" release (if that ever happens).
B0058YPGSY|5.0|I am not telling you how I feel about this show (although I have loved every episode of every season) I get so sick of people doing that, almost telling you everything that happens.  Wonder if they know how silly they sound?  In any case, the DVD's arrived here in a timely manner and in good shape, other than that, if you like it you will buy it.  If not you won't.  What more is there?  :-)
B0031KE9C6|5.0|Smart, clever, touching, funny, suspenseful.  Kristen Bell is so appealing and the other actors are also excellent.  Veronica is whipsmart and got a great smile, but her appeal (to me) is her vulnerability and the tension she feels between doing what is right and doing what is going to get her what she wants.  She's conflicted in a lot of ways, and far from perfect, but a very sympathetic character that I am rooting for all the way.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|First of all I am not going to bore you with my opinion about this show.  I figured you wouldn't be here considering buying them if you didn't like the show.  I am so sick of folks giving you their opinion of the show when you already have your own opinion about it.  I received the DVD's in a very timely manner and in good shape.  Other than that what else can I tell you?  Except, enjoy your videos if you choose to get them, I know I am :-)
B007THA4FI|3.0|Writing is good, story chopped up and very depressing.  I finished it only because the writing was good, was my first Kindle read
B00DL47RQ2|1.0|This is THE WORST movie I have seen in years.  It was like watching mental patients barely functioning without much of a storyline and way too many flashbacks.  I really wanted to like this movie but it was impossible to empathize with any of the main characters - primarily vacuous shells of people.  The only decent acting in the movie was by Andrew Dice Clay and Bobby Cannavale with relatively minor parts.  Bottom line - Woody Allen needs garbage bag sized containers of antidepressants - stat!  And anyone watching this movie will need to watch something much better afterward (or go to therapy) to get this out of their system.
B001ECQ75A|5.0|I had only ever watched the very beginning of this movie, but had always heard good things about it. I decided to hold my breath and find out for myself and I'm so glad that I did!! This movie is so clever, filled with fantastic kung fu fighting animals of all kinds who are memorable for both their wit and their heart. I laughed out loud throughout the entire film! This movie is great entertainment for kids, teaching them that anything is possible if you just believe in yourself, and it's great fun for the adults as well!! Great for the entire family. We absolutely adore it!
B0036S4B6M|4.0|At first I thought this book was going to be written in a delusional and self indulgent style. However the more time that passed in this woman's journey, the more the story evolved. Ms. Kermans ability to write seemed to evolve as well. I think anyone will find this story heart warming and encouraging..even if they've never been caught in our nations broken judicial system
B0019IIPXQ|4.0|Pitch Black is great introduction to the Riddick character.  This movie in particular is much darker than the Chronicles of Riddick but that what I love about it.  It has that slight horror edge that keeps you on the edge of your seat
B00BUCXVPI|4.0|Good action and well delivered acting.  Surprised at screen delivery compared to expectations from having read books.  Actors selected worked even if a bi of a stretch.
B00E1LAS42|2.0|I generally like Baz Luhrmann and Leonardo but I just didn't enjoy this one it came off somewhat flat. Nice costumes and production design tho.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|I  ( was ) getting used to the idea that the idea for movies had all but run out , with the entering into the<br />/ superhero / genre to appease the beast was milking the public intelligence down to a puddling goo i sat in my home and was sweetened by the trailer of ( NOW YOU SEE ME  ).<br />I just finished this movie and i am now revived that there is life yet for the silver screen.<br />Allowing myself to be engaged and taken away like this was a long time coming , With perfect cast direction and a story to be unparalleled in a infinite amount of years past as iam now assured to come will be a new dream for the video mind as this is with out a doubt the best magic story to date.
B00637D114|2.0|My kids enjoyed this movie, but not enough to actually watch it the whole way through.  The use of the word smurf as a cuss word was just ridiculous.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. I have it downloaded on my phone, tablet and kindle. My son and daughter has it downloaded on their phones. The scenery always changes. A must have.
B005COO1X6|4.0|good plot.  well written good ending.  Stephan king is a sure bet for a good book.  I tried the sample first
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|It keeps bored kids interested. The fish are created just like in the movie. StormyWolfMoon add me StormyWolfMoon@yahoo<br />A definite must have.
B008QYT7DI|1.0|This review is for the Kindle edition only.  I love Saint-Exupery's creation and was excited to read it on my new Kindle.  My mouth fell open when I got an error message trying to download it.  I tried pushing it from my \\"Manage My Kindle\\" page but that didn't work.  I then tried downloading it from my Kindle itself, but got an error saying this edition is not compatible with my device!  Say what???  I can't really imagine why that would be or why Amazon would not rectify it.  Ended up reading it on the Amazon cloud reader.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I chose this rating because, it was  amazing and it has so much truth in it. This is a book I would read over and over again. It's a romance that ends tragically.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|This movie is a new twist on an old favorite. I really don't mind that things are so mixed up, it makes it more fun. My kids and I have watched this several times and we will probably watch several more times.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|I haven't listened to an entire album in forever. There wasn't a single song I didn't like. It's nice to hear something different for a change.
B005ZOBNOI|2.0|So many people talked about this book that i thought I might like it.  Unfortunately, even though it is very well written, I found it depressing and a complete downer.  I want to be uplifted by what I read and this topic cold not come close to that goal.
B00BI5IXL4|4.0|I knew that Russell Crowe has a rock band but never expected this title to be a musical. And it is just that: a musical, not opera.  The opening scene pulls you in before you realize it's a musical and from there on out you don't care.  The plot line stays true to the Andrew Lloyd Webber version of the story.<br /><br />Dislikes: some of the symbology was beyond my reach<br />Likes: everything else about the movie
B00B2G4O2G|5.0|A show that keeps you guessing and makes you wonder how they will do season 2. A MUST SEE if you like tv series about serial killers
B006UV8DJS|2.0|This program does some really beautiful things but it is not in the least bit intuitive.  In this day and age, programs MUST be intuitive if you expect to have people use it.  With a little more effort this could be a five star app.
B0095P31L6|5.0|This was a cartoon we can all relate to in our lives. Johnny Depp is a great actor and brought the story to life.
B00005JA8B|5.0|And to think I was watching a VHS tape of this great movie all these years!<br />Now I can really watch the movie!  Thank you.  Lance.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Good App if you want to download video. Love it would recommend it for persons who love to down load.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I believe that Hosseini is one of the finest writers of our time.This book is a very sensitive study of the lives of two women. It explores the cruelty and complicated relationship with their husband set in the background os Afghanistan. It weaves the powerful relationship that develops between the two women. It is beautifully written and holds the rapt attention of the reader from page one.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|What else needs to be said? It's free and it's fun. For a more detailed game use your pc. For the kindle this is a good option.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a good read with an interesting premise. This is the second Flynn novel I've read and I liked them both. I will say, however, that the ending left me a little flat but there was plenty of tension, twists and turns throughout the book.
B003IWZ1D8|5.0|What can anyone say that hasn't already been said — and shouldn't be said to anyone who has not yet seen this magnificent film. Pop in the disc, grab your popcorn, dim the lights, and feast your eyes on this beautifully restored version on bluray at last. And even if you can't find a copy of 'Psycho' on bluray, it's still worth it on plain old DVD. Nothing can diminish Hitch at his best ... and without question, 'Psycho' is one of his very best.
B009VMN3RA|4.0|This book keeps you very entertained and is fun to read.  Don't quite feel that all is absolutely true but who knows?  I have enjoyed reading it and would recommend it.
B007KUFDBY|5.0|Back in 2002, Disney made an animated film for boys, but sadly, the boys did not flock to the cinemas to see it. That's a shame, because 'Treasure Planet' is actually one of Disney's finest -- and one of the last great hand-drawn animated features (along with Disney's 'Lilo & Stitch', also released in 2002 -- in fact, both 'Treasure Planet' and 'Lilo & Stitch' were Oscar nominated for Best Animated Feature Film, which they lost to Miyazaki's masterpiece 'Spirited Away').<br /><br />The wonderful thing about home video is that it offers a second chance to great films that somehow slipped through the cracks. This beautifully animated film, with exceptional voice performances by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Brian Murray, and Emma Thompson, richly deserves that second chance.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers. It is an amazing game and I play it every day. The only thing that gets on my nerves about it is if you want to update you have to go to the store and click on the update.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|I love these movies. I wanted to see both before seeing Before Midnight which, in my opinion, was not as good as the first two.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is really cool. The game is well put together and it is realistic. I think it is a truly amazing game.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I love these books! Very few times I have read a book and cried or laughed out loud. These books do both for me. Love Jace and Clary!!
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Even though I have lived through the events from this movie, I had forgotten a lot of the details. It was very well produced and acted and I highly recommend it to anyone!
B0090P98Z4|5.0|My son is having a lot  of fun with this game. I was always a fan of Diablo so this game really has that appeal.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|First off, I like all the stars in this movie and I wasn't disappointed in the entertainment they provided. I had forgotten I'd seen this movie before but it was still fun to watch again. The violence is no where graphic to the point of being disgusting but you definitely get the point that these people know how to use a weapon. Would recommend to anyone.
1451627297|4.0|Time travellng is not a favorite of mine but this book was well written and enjoyable. It had an interesting ending.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Of course, Daniel Day-Lewis is brilliant in this movie which is why I watched it. I found it hard to follow even though, because of my age, I felt I was pretty well informed. I know Lincoln was known for his &#34;stories&#34; but I thought some of them were difficult to assimilate to the situation. It's a movie I think I would have to watch a second time to get all the details. Recommend for fans of Day-Lewis as well as history fans. Novice would have to watch at least twice
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Fun and challenging game . I wish it didnt take so long to fill energy or quests didnt use so much energy..i think maybe 5 energy points would be fair for a quests .im enjoying it while im sick in bed
093183841X|5.0|This is the most recent update to the best work I know on old still cameras. It adds considerable data to the earlier versions.<br />As film photography passes from everyday life to a specialist hobby and film cameras move from being utilitarian tools to being collectors' items, this edition of this book may stand (as there's been no update for seven years) as the definitive work for collectors and historians. I'm not sure the prices are at all accurate, but, as a collector, I don't use this as a price guide but as a research tool.
0783233477|5.0|I just love this movie and I have seen it at least 10 times, it is a long movie but so worth watching, product was in excellent condition.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Excellent book with many insights . Well written and well organized . Strongly suggested to anyone who are interested in North Korea .
0684803356|4.0|ok i thought it was on the same thing and i thought would be ok if I just wrote it
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is very helpful, I've tried at least four and this is the best I've seen yet thanks ,Amazon
B008602KQI|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. Great action and keeps you engaged throughout the entire movie. Saw it several times and I still have the same reactions. A must see!!&#34;
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Even though at times this show can be frustratingly slow, I love the character development and the acting is superb. My best friend and I watch it and we are always excited to see what's next!
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Ok if you are patient waiting for energy to restore. No need to spend cash can be done by playing strategic game
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|An enjoyable version of Cinderella. Makes you laugh, cry, get angry, and celebrate; multiple times and not necessarily in that order. A good &#34;movie night&#34; movie with girlfriends and daughters.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|Finally, videos and extras of my favorite musicians at my finger tips! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who loves music!
0783230079|5.0|A unique Rom-Com that we enjoy watching time and again. The movie that introduced my now college aged girls to Robert Downey Jr. They insisted we replace our worn out VHS with a DVD so we can continue to enjoy and share this movie for many more years.
B007IPJMCM|5.0|Vulgar is, from start to finish, an absolute masterpiece. Top 5 metal record ever. Possibly only Slayer s Reign In Blood can top it
B004BSFC46|1.0|Hardly rattled. Baby loved the colors. Hung it on her baby seat and she loved seeing the colors. But I purchased it for a rattle which was a disappointment
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's so fun and addicting I got this game when it first came  out and I still love it and all ways will it's easy enough for my brother and sister yet challenging enough for myself. I love this game I highly recommend this game who ever you are if your 3 or 103
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I can't even put into words just how incredible this is. I LITERALLY cannot. This is just so.... I don't quite understand how to breathe or live or function anymore. I don't know if these are tears, or my SOUL POURING FROM MY EYES. Can one even LIVE properly after reading something so beautiful, amazing, and heart-breaking? Honestly, there really aren't any words I can put together to share with you the beauty and impact of this book. No matter how hard I try. I just can't. All I can do is cry and hope that people will take away from this book, not that it was just a good book they were glad to stumble upon, but take away the, I don't quite know how to phrase it, really, the outlook on the the way things are. How things have to be. How things can't be, no matter how hard you wish for them. And, just how things are. To some, it may seem depressing or sappy, but I say that it's just.... well.... the only way to know how amazing this is, is to read it yourself. You will NOT regret it.\\"Okay?\\"
B007A4SDCG|5.0|I like this book because it is practical. This book provides the motivation needed to keep going in the tough times.<br />Unlike some other motivational self help books that beat the bush around with vague theories on human relationships this book provides practical step by step solution to getting out of comfort zone and doing the task that you set out for.
B009LDD54K|5.0|This season is awesome. I am glad they have shifted their focus on Richard a bit. I can't wait for season 4.
B006OCM0G0|2.0|Restaurant story does not give you the amount of coins you deserve!!!!... and it sucks i think im on the verge of deleting it!
B001AMNL2Q|4.0|Though vulgar, this is a funny and serious movie. As the journalist says, it addresses the duality of man. It's a classic that all generations should see, once age appropriate.
B005LAIIFS|5.0|the movie is great. my little guy loves this movie, he wants to watch it because of the big rabbit.
1422188612|3.0|I was looking for more general information and there are some very good ideas in this book.  Updated version was nice.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Best free game so far,still getting the hang of it but I like the graphics and the game play is amazing
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Like his other books, just wonderful characters and wonderful story telling.  An added bonus is his ability to help us understand another culture.
0930289234|5.0|As review #1200, I wanted to add my brief acclaim. What is amazing is that about 2/3 of the way in, six or so story lines unfold in a manner that neither a novel nor a screen can yet reproduce well. That is, the tales, the captions, the images all hover and as they flit across the page into your mind's eye, you \\"see\\" resonances in your imagination from the layered stories, in a most engaging and intricately fashioned way of verbal and visual narrative. The sophistication itself deserves acclaim, let alone the fresh way that the middle-aged and elderly crises of superheroes make for a new take on a by-now familiar genre.<br /><br />A second attempt rewarded. I had tried it years ago but found the pace slow as I was scanning each frame for context or clues. The density, as in an engrossing film or novel, rewards rereading or giving it yet another try.<br /><br />While near the end some genre limits of the force of compression needed as the tales came together, and certain surprises seemed to be tucked deeply away in what had been previously shown, this sort of tension, explication, and sudden revelation is standard for the well-told adventure. The complexity of this, and the coordination of the caption and image with the multiplying narratives build this up into a memorable experience. As if you get to read a novel and see a movie simultaneously, and best of all you still with the words spinning out keep your own vision of the story somehow intact. Pay attention to the newsstand, as by then, the levels of story piling up make this rewarding for the patient reader.<br /><br />I came to this in a different direction from perhaps most readers. I rarely read graphic novels but as I liked \\"V for Vendetta\\" on my then-teen son's recommendation, and even the film--which benefited by prior exposure to the printed story, I sought out Alan Moore's debut novel. I liked for a similar immersion into words spun out well the overlooked and ambitious \\"A Voice in the Fire.\\" I recently reviewed (8/2013) it; it too was recommended after I finished David Mitchell's \\"Cloud Atlas\\"; that left me wondering about similarly expansive linguistic novels and themes.<br /><br />So, I came to finish \\"Watchmen.\\" It kept me up late more than one night. As with \\"V,\\" and \\"A Voice,\\" Moore's talent is evident, and while the pace and theme of \\"Watchmen\\" may be less local and more global than his novel set in his native English city of Northampton, it shares the love of conspiracy, hidden forces, anarchic ideals, occult energies, and compassion for humanity and creatures which infuses so much speculative fiction nowadays--and in the inspirations for Moore and Bennett. I will seek out more from both.reviewed (8/2013) it; it too was recommended after I finished David Mitchell's \\"Cloud Atlas\\"; that left me wondering about similarly expansive linguistic novels and themes.<br /><br />So, I came to finish \\"Watchmen.\\" It kept me up late more than one night.

B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Good movie, awesome scenery, M83's music was awesome, more of a love story. Theme was Very much like The Matrix without the action
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Secrets. Amazing story of families and their choices. How what we do at any given time affects our lives down the road. Rachel lost her daughter at a young age and carries this burden her whole life until she is face to face with the murderer. Tess and Will have their own rocky marriage brought on by Tess's cousin Felicity. Only after having these lives mingle with each other do they know their true feelings. Slow at times but a very deep and moving story.
B0040HO16S|5.0|There are many Anglophiles among us here in the USA.  Some are direct descendants from an English parent and others want to be.  We all look at England as being very refined and gentle during the time of Lark Rise to Candleford.  This series is what we want to remember England as being.  It's what we want to see when we visit England.  England is known for her traditions and we just hope she can hang on to them.  That's why the Royal family is so important to everyone.<br /><br />PROS:  Casting is excellent and the storyline draws you right in.  The settings are well done.<br /><br />CONS:  Starting the series, I had to really zero in on what they were saying and get used to the accents.  Once I was \\"into\\" the episodes my ear got tuned in to the conversations.<br /><br />I love, love, love the whole first season.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|I think you should get more then one coin per answer or the hints should be cheaper... but the app is good and its fun and I enjoy playing  it.. basically I'm doing this for coins though
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|This is one of the best Pay_Changeling books yet. I read it in one day. Totally unable to put it down. When is the next one coming? I can't wait!
B000FBFMIO|5.0|This, as all the other books I have read by Robin Hobbs, was spellbinding.  I especially like the way her \\"series\\" all seem to join together.
