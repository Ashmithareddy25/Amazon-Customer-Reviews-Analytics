B0097GVJWQ|4.0|I really enjoyed the same ...I didn't even realize it involved not just one but two suspicious people and for it to end that way saying to be continued....I am looking forward to the next game.....
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|They look great in my 3 yo daughters princess room. She had a fun time picking out where to put them. They have been up for a couple of months now and no issues.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is the best free horse game on Amazon's store<br />And it's really hard to find a game that actually lets you play with the horse
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Good book for teens - my granddaughter asked me to read it.  She loved it and wanted my opinion.  We both weren't too happy with the ending and we texted each other with what we thought would be a good one.
B004QX07G4|5.0|Soooooo funnny every<br /> single page is hilarious. Ellen's optimism jumps up in every page. It's very life changing, and she gives great advice.

0446580848|2.0|In my opinion, this was nsothing more than a guided tour of Yemen and the excitement finally started near the end of the book.  I usually like Nelson DeMille's books...have most of them...so I was disappointed in this one.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Awesome game, happy with the selection of tilt device or touch screen to steer. All around, really no complaints about this game. Good job with graphics.
1409136612|5.0|I always love Maeve Binchy books and have them all.  Just sorry there will not be any more about her Dublin friends.
0896898288|5.0|I really enjoyed the letters of the farmer's wife life. I think back in the 1920's farmers were havwing a rough time and city folks thought that farm life was backwards and they didn't have any fun. Well let me a sure they did and they were also educated.<br />I cd along with book is also great. I am going to do three or four of the blocks for a quilt to give to a non-profit org.
B00BN2CY7G|5.0|How can you go wrong. The ballads are heart felt and the rock is still rocking. To those who think John can not still get up there in range, take a listen to &#34;Amen&#34;. 30 years and still getting it done!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|this game rocks its one of the best games I have ever come across.in my free time all I would do is play the game. it is the best game ever!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Fun concept. I like that you do not have to start over after having your brains eaten. The grandson(7 yrs) loves to help me play.
1400069289|4.0|I think i need this book! I definitely have some habit's i'd like to break (one in particular) however, i wish it was more like 100 pages and not 400. the most I've read is like 360 something, is this 400 page book worth it? will it help me break my habits. sorry i know this isn't a review, but i am really interested in this book. if anybody's read it and would like to answer my question that would awesome!
B000NA2BEU|5.0|As others have written, the 3rd season of Veronica Mars isn't quite as good as seasons 1 and 2, but then again the first two seasons were perfect, while the 3rd season in merely outstanding.  I guess when you set the bar so high that it's hard to compete.  Regardless, season 3 is really good and entertaining and a must see.  A open ended ending is the only downside, but then again the show was cancelled and wasn't able to address the final issues.  Fortunately they will have a chance with a new movie in 2014 to tie up the loose ends and maybe get a new series going.  Let's hope.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|While the writing style is decent, the story itself just had me rolling my eyes way too much - especially the last chapter or 2. The world building is almost non-existent, and what there is of it doesn't make a lot of sense.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Fun match three game.  I own a number of Playrix games on my laptop and love every one.  Would be nice to have Fishdom on my Android tablet.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|this is a great movie that all generation could enjoy gripping edge of your seat type love the move and is a ggreat movie added to my collection thank you
B009AMANBA|5.0|Some movies seem over-rated by the critics, but not this one.  I love Argo and Life of Pi, but if the Oscars were a true indication of movie greatness, this would have swept.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Climate deniers have tried to refute the facts.  Al Gore has made a movie that clearly shows scientific facts on anthropogenic causes of climate change. It's us! and here we find out what we have done and what we can do about it. Watch and be stunned. Then change your actions and take care of Mother Earth.
B008YWY0HK|3.0|Tangled is a better over-all movie, but not as good looking.  Are you buying for the artistry or the story?
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game is amazing. I love the strategy and how you can buy different soldiers to help America become and stay victorious.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|I never thought I'd LIKE an Adam Sandler movie, much less OWN one, but this movie is just to fun for words.  By the way, there are no children in our house- we bought it for ourselves.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|its realy fun its a lot better than temple run 1 even the monkey guy is upgraded he is huge and you can collect gems to save your self its so cool
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Hard times in the world during 1930-40. The well known families from the first novel are struggling to survive. Also recommended
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This app has many different options for games to play. I have enjoyed most of them. Being rewarded for game playing by being able to get new games is a great concept. The only thing that I consider a negative is that once you've spent points to buy a new game you can't change your mind if you don't like it. Other than that it's great and Free!
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Very well written novel about an interesting time. Nice to read about working class people as well as aristocrats.Looking forward to the second book. Recommended.<br />Lars Sunden Sweden
0439023491|5.0|It is hard to put down the entire &#34;Hunger Games&#34; trilogy, this being the second of the 3 books.<br />I am having withdrawal now from Katniss Everdeen who is a heroine with complexity,<br />strength and ingenuity. I could not guess at what would happen from one page to the next.<br />How will this end is constantly on  your mind as you read through as it feels to be a world as<br />real as our own. Suzanne Collins is a masterful story teller and writer and I hope she will<br />soon return to adult/young adult fiction to create another unforgettable story.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|As a middle school teacher - I was just about shunned for not having read these yet.  I purchased on a very good deal - and I can't put it down!  Read the first 2 books in 4 days.  As a mom of 3 - I teased that they were in their own version of the hunger games, since I did nothing but read for those 4 days!  So good - and so happy that I read before the movie!!!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It was nice to view American words instead of British words. It was rather fancy to view there slang. Thnx
B000JQUKKU|5.0|Who doesn't love the classic?  This version didn't disappoint and the price was great.  Great service by the seller as well.
B007DKNEI0|5.0|Also redone by Andy Pearce the set collects their later Virgin output and is a no filler of TD.Nice to have them together in one package, you get art cover work reproduction for the most part and all albums flow together nicely.This and the earlier Virgin set are worthy purchases for completists. Set comes in a Jewel case
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Read after getting hooked on Langdon's work.  This novel did not disappoint and I highly recommend it if you like Langdon's other books.
B00C1BV9Z6|5.0|This movie got me hooked onto dinosaurs ever since I was very young.<br />The special effects don't look as amazing compared to when it first came out, but it still looks very realistic.<br />The acting is great; the first half of the movie gives time to develop the characters and get an understanding of the characters. The kids in the movie might crawl under people's skin, but they don't really bother me much. The second half is where stuff hits the fan.<br />The movie also gives a believable reason why the dinosaurs are there; they just aren't thrown into the movie out of nowhere, expecting the audience to get over that fact they came out of nowhere.<br />The soundtrack is astounding; the theme of this film is one of the most beautiful pieces of music my ears have been blessed with.<br />The direction Steven Spielberg took near perfectly matches the tone of the original book. Not too corny or too serious, Spielberg does a fantastic job directing this movie.<br />What I love most about this movie is the magic it brings to us. This movie literally revitalised dinosaurs in film. Imagining these vast creatures roam the land we stand on sixty-five million years ago just blows my mind.<br />This is my all-time favorite movie. A fourth film has been announced for release next year, so I trust Spielberg to bring us the magic we got back in '93.
B0015DROBO|5.0|A friend recommended and the book did not disappoint.  Excellent story and told well by the author.  I would recommend to anyone who likes mystery/adventure.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The dialogue is wonderful with most of the best one-liners going to Maggie Smith's Countess Dowager. And she delivers them in a way only she can. The entire show is perfectly cast with engaging and hateful characters who alternatively show themselves to be hateful and engaging.
B005NPCUC8|3.0|A classic album, putting it mildly for sure.  Remasters are always exciting as they hold the proimse to make your favorite music sound even better.  Unfortunately, great deal though this was at $2.99 MP3, I hear no noticeable sound difference at all vs. my regular CD.  I think, if you already own a copy, you should stick with it as you'll just be paying for the same Thing.<br /><br />RM Tampa, FL
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|No problems with this USB Cable, works great. It just plugs in to the wall plug and you're ready to go..
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Keeps you on the edge of your seat. It is very realistic without being too gory. Excellent portrayal of the time period.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham keeps you in suspense until the end of the book. I really enjoyed this book, I have read just about every of John Gisham's books. This one is right up there as one of his best.
030759565X|4.0|This book would be a great purchase if just for the dessert recipes. Had it for less than a month and have already made several.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|This app is amazing. The graphics are clearly phoenomenal and it is easy as well as fun to play. Eventually, it got kind of boring for me. That is just my opinion, but otherwise, I love the game.
B003DXSXCI|5.0|Steve McQueen is a great actor. Action, suspense, a great chase scene, everybody should see this.<br /> Robert Vaughn has always been great to hate as well.  I loved it.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This app is great for people who enjoy puzzle games. At the beginning, the levels are very simple and as you continue, they become increasingly challenging. Sometimes, as the levels get more difficult, it is hard to want to continue because you may be stuck on a level (you won't be able to continue until you pass the level). Other than that, the app is a great puzzle game for a variety of ages.
B00BOLE7X0|5.0|This film is remarkable, for all of the emotions it stirs up in the viewer, including the sad emotions. This is not just a film about history  being made, or history itself. It's great storytelling, full of rich and rewarding and funny and human character, who just happened to  be real human beings, who made history themselves. Of course, the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis is astounding and I don't feel I am exaggerating when I saw it is also magnificent. Mr.Lewis truly makes Abraham Lincoln come so strongly to life. Mr.Lewis's Lincoln is human and flawed and funny and good-hearted; but also a political realist and a political genuis. My tears flowed at the end of this film, watching Lincoln die and the flashback to one of the greatestest speeches Lincoln wrote, which I have on my book shelf. I dare anyone to NOT cry at the end of this film. What a loss Lincoln's death was to this country, and now. Sorry for the spoiler, but I couldn't avoid. This film brings out the idealist in myself.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is a great way to enjoy yourself when you're bored. The screen doesn't need to be tilted, but rather you have to use your finger to move back and forth. The graphics are very modern and in a sort of cartoon style. Overall, this app was a great addition to my Kindle Fire.
B00BQPEIT2|1.0|This is game is for people who have never played the original temple run game, why pay for this disney reincarnation rather than play the far more superior original free temple run game, both this and brave are horrible.  Just don't buy it.  All disney does is screw up nowadays so just walk away from this game and get the better one..
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Very fun to read ! Never boring. It's a rare litterature event dont miss it. It's full of suspense and surprises in the story, but also the characters are very credible.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Love the show. So many story lines going on at once. I just love the characters too. Wish it was longer.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I love this game! Well executed, many options for upgrades, challenging, fast- paced, nice visual, and just very well done. Recommend to anyone who loves a good time management game!
1400069807|4.0|I found some of the history interesting as I used to work for Pillsbury.  I think the book is a good reminder to look at labels, even if this takes more time.  Frustrating to know the govt puts so little toward consumer health and awareness vs. support of big business and farming
B0034DGPEU|4.0|The author puts you right there in the story. Riveting. I enjoyed every chapter and could not out it down.
B0086700CM|5.0|THE FIRST TEMPLE RUN GAME I GOT WAS TEMPLE RUN2. TEMPLE RUN IS WAY BETTER THAN SPIDER MAN AND HULK
B0084B5TK8|5.0|I really am enjoying Dracula. I'm a teenager that loves to read but can never seem to keep a classic in her hands. This proved my opinion that all classic novels are dry and heartless completely wrong! It is very good.
6304712944|1.0|the dvd was supposed to be new and it did not appear new, it also did not fit the screen, it was elongated but short on the t.v., the picture was terrible.  I returned it with a bad review but was never paid for the shipping which I feel should have been returned also
B004WGIXX4|5.0|From beginning to end this movie and full of comedy and love.  One of my favorite movies.  I highly recommended!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is an oft told story of power and corruption-- well done.  Fairly light-- as these stories go--  I liked the characters and nuances achieved.
B0068THAGY|3.0|I liked the movie but not totally crazy about it.  Its ok to watch it once but I wont watch this movie again.
076790592X|3.0|The greatest takeaway from this touching account of the slow death of Mitch Albom's friend, Morrie Schwartz, is that you're not ready to live until you're ready to die.<br /><br />  \\"Aging . . . is more than the negative that you're going to die, it's also the positive that you understand that you're going to die, and that you live better because of it.\\"<br /><br />Over the course of many Tuesdays, Mitch visits with Morrie about \\"life's greatest lesson,\\" discussing issues of life such as self-pity, regrets, death, family, emotions, aging, love, marriage, and forgiveness.<br /><br />Everyone reads a book differently, through the filter of his or her own world view. And although I can appreciate the truth and sheer wisdom of each chapter as it relates to life, I couldn't help but think the book overlooks the potential insight life offers to the next life.<br /><br />  \\"Aging . . . is more than the negative that you're going to die . . .\\"<br /><br />Yeah, but you can't sidestep the negative. It's the most-certain event of anyone's life.<br /><br />I totally understand that the book isn't about the afterlife. I get it. Nevertheless, it seems strange to read a book about a dying man sharing distilled wisdom about life and death with no discussion about life after death.<br /><br />The book does a great job highlighting how death brings clarity to life. So you apply those lessons and have a great life.<br /><br />Then what?
B000JMLFLW|5.0|Pride and Prejudice.  I really enjoyed this book.  Have never read Jane Austen before and I loved her writing.  The characters were well developed and the story line interesting.  I do enjoy reading this time period.
1451695195|5.0|Well-written and easy to read through the chapters---the scientific language was a bit difficult to understand, but did not take away from the point or the emotion with which it was written.
B00ABO573A|4.0|This is an interesting movie.  Very realistic in what two people go through in a relationship when addiction is involved..
B002JTHFUS|5.0|U2 is one of my favorite groups. This is one of there best albums. Great to have the extra CD with outakes and extras. Nice package good price fast shipping.
B0050XFY4O|3.0|This picture is pretty controversial, especially by American standards.  It covers both homosexuality and incest simultaneously.  Not everyone would be up for it.
B008EKOO46|1.0|This is crazy, $19.99 for a Kindle book, this better not be the new norm for Kindle books.  I'd like to read this title,but I guess I'll wait a couple of years until the price gets down.<br /><br />My understanding of this problem is that its not the authors fault or Amazons fault, the blame lays at the greedy publisher.
B0042816YK|1.0|The Dvd started out fine and then half way through the picture freezes but the sound keeps going it was horrible
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|A bit tedious on some areas. but worth a little hassle. I wish the ii helped just a little more.<br /><br />I'm eager to try these new levels!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this game is fantastic. I play for hours at a time . the world is large and varied and the garphics are awesome. glitches lost my progress score etc. a few times but no problems since I reinstalled.

0061906220|5.0|This book is one of my favorites. I love it! A good lesson for kids and adults...it's all good. :)
B004QK5N5W|5.0|I purchased the adapter for my iPad 2. I used an HDMI cable between adapter and TV. At first did not work but was not the adaptor's fault, it was my mistake because I connected the adapter with the iPad on. I shut off the iPad and started again and the image appeared on my TV. Works perfect.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is one of those books that is slow to set up the scene, but once it is set......I had a hard time putting it down!<br />Great book for a trip, It has many twist and turns and a very surprising end.
030758836X|5.0|I absolutely have never read a psychological thriller like this ever.  How does this author get inside the heads of her characters?  There were twists and turns I didn't see coming.  I absolutely read this book in two days only because I could not stop reading.  I had to find out what happened at the end.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Best Keyboard i've ever owned amazing for gaming!!!<br /><br />No ear pain after wearing and good for everything!!!<br /><br />I LOVE IT!
0525952926|5.0|My husband read the book first.  I read it when he was finished.  We thought the bridge from one book to this one was very good as Winter of the World helped us to remember the character families in the last book.  I love sagas and this certainly is one.  The history that surrounds the characters is written so that I visualize each and every chapter.  I didin't want to read the book too fast.  When that happens to me, I know savoring the book is a must.  That tells me I loved the story.  When will the next book be out?  Has it been written yet?
B00BESM14U|5.0|{4.5 stars}<br /><br />THE PERKS of BEING a WALLFLOWER is extremely poignant, well-acted, and well-filmed. It begins, I think deliberately, with the usual clich&eacute;s and stereotypes of high school existence: Charlie the shy little freshman getting his class copy of TO KILL a MOCKINGBIRD ripped up by an arrogant senior, Charlie sitting alone during the big prom, etc. It quickly evolves, however, into something much more unique and convincing. Emma Watson and Ezra Miller particularly shine as Charlie's new friends, found seemingly by accident (as they often are), and their entire weird artsy kids' circle is SO immediately engrossing and believable.<br /><br />Understandably, many comparisons have been made with [[ASIN:B001BR5NN0 The Breakfast Club]], and, though PERKS is also set in the age of cassette tapes and typewriters, it appeals to the heart in the same timeless way, making it another film that's likely to survive and be watched many years from now.<br /><br />PERKS is not flawless. Elements such as sister Candace's tumultuous relationship with \\"Ponytail Derek,\\" Charlie's abuse as a child at the hands of his now-deceased aunt, and Charlie's mental illness don't always interrelate or seem to play significant roles in the story. Various details--e.g., while this is supposedly set in 1991-2, home computers are still apparently unknown--are also out of whack. Yet, these factors do not appear to bother many other people, and  PERKS is a good enough film that even the imperfections serve to humanize and perhaps even make it better. The more I think about it, everything that goes on here IS quite relevant simply in showing the complexities of growing up and being alive.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Just the intro to the show is creepy and inviting.  All I have to do is show the intro to friends to give them a peek into how the show is.  The story line and characters are great.
B0000042MY|5.0|First time I viewed this movie and heard that wonderful music for the soundtrack, I was definitely hooked.  The music is just so hauntingly beautiful, memorable and speaks to the soul.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|if the companies actually read the reviews, well lets just say I payed 2.99 fir 65 gems and it went through to amazon and went in as a payment and the game did not count them. so tthe gems I'm guessing are just a waste if money if you don't get what you paid for. I wish amazon could give me aa refund
B001P1MZNI|5.0|It's Sinatra...can't even elaborate on this.  You either love him or you don't.  I'm in the former category and won't apologize for that.  ALL wonderful classics.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|I downloaded the game and it worked fine but the sounds are messed up. It is NOT my kindle if that's what your thanking because I can play music on it and it would sound fine. : ' ( I love games like this but they need to fix the sound problem.
B0070Y46UY|1.0|This book was recommended by a friend. It was terrible. I kept reading it, thinking the best was coming and it never did. This book was a big waste of time.

B007ZXK08C|5.0|The plot was well crafted and kept me guessing, but the best part was the character development which managed to capture and portray an extreme version of modern marriage extremely well.  I haven't read any more of Flynn's work but I now plan to.
B0084AXZK0|4.0|I can see why this book is considered a &#34;classic&#34;.  It delves into the superficial judgments in society without being moralistic.
B005651RDS|4.0|The author uses an intersting device - a Charles Dickens novel - to draw out the story of a young girl caught in civil war on Bougainville Island in the Pacific.  While the question arises as to whether the author (a white male) has the right to speak in the voice of a young indigenous girl, I think Jones does an excellent job in highlighting this sad and forgotten slice of history, and treats the characters with respect and sensitivity.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I do enjoy this version more than the last.  There is more to do and so much more to choose from.  However,  there are some flaws. The energy level meter is one as invest points.  A lot people just want to build and not be hindered by the energy level (even though it does regenerate), or are unable to purchase one of the many new selections because they don't have enough invest points.  That Sufis because instead just building, you have figure out how to earn invest points by doing God knows what and at the end of day you can't afford it anyway.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great app, it keeps you busy, but it doesn't take up time you don't have. I like it! I wish that gems were easier to get, though.
006097625X|4.0|Scott McCloud puts into words (pictures) a standard methodology to looking at or creating comics. Its a great summary of the medium and gives great examples of the medium. He attempts to elevate the comic medium as more than just a children's entertainment with understandable connections. He takes his time to draw out what he means not only with words but images, that work along side each other. He also tries too hard to summarize a large medium, including American and European comics but even tries to explain manga (which he cuts a couple of corners on by adding in only a fraction of the discussion that can be made). But this is a great text to get a general sense of the medium for new time comic readers and even just simply put a logical standard for well versed comic readers.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|GREAT BOOK!! Fell in love with all the characters and all the twists and turns - sad to reach the end but happy with the way it ended.
B00B2G2RG6|4.0|Lots of twists and thrills, and a really excellent cast. Kevin Bacon is fantastic as the cursed Ryan Hardy, and James Purefoy is pure joy as the delightfully messed-up-in-the-head Joe Carroll. The supporting cast is fantastic and the storylines keep you watching...you really want to know what's going to happen next. Will be interesting to see how they stretch this into several seasons, but if they do, I'll watch to find out.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|after you get the hang of it, quite a fun game. I downloaded this on my kindle fire and have not had any problems with it at all. I do feel it is quite similar to Mario, like I had read.
B0049P1N3K|5.0|Love it, really good book,,, Recommend it to everyone. Help you see the world differently and clearly. Planing to read it again.
B0067TQQI8|4.0|Good product, except adapter for droid phone broke. The metal adapter loosened op and does not make connection to wire and therefore does not charge the phone. Without adapter, battery can't be used. Without better design, there are better options<br />After  telling company  about the  problem the staff acted immediately, were courteous,& immediately sent several replacement parts, not just one. The battery has worked very well and I have not had any problems with the replacement adapter.

B001N1DPDE|5.0|I believe this is a great choice to meet all your camping needs and most all demands for your BoB or even for deployment. I'm also a BK9 & OKC RD Tanto owner and have owned TOPS brand knives. I've used knives in a deployed setting, outdoors, and in a maintenance/industrial setting. I've beat up the old BK 2 and it's everything all the reviews tell you it is and more. I love it.....a lot! If you need a knife 6&#34; or shorter to take camping that can do most everything and you don't mind modifying the sheath (at least wrapping in 550 cord) then it's the BK2 all day. It gives you a great chop, has a comfortable handle swell, and is durable.<br /><br />Other things to ponder:  With less than an Andrew Jackson now between the BK2 and many of the OKC RD Series of knives it should give you some tradeoffs to think about.  I've recently got into researching and using OKC knives and I'm now a fan.  I don't think OKC knives come as factory sharp as KA-BARs but you can fix that w/a little effort. The OKC line offers a lot of great options that (just like the BK2) keeps you from spending too much of the kiddie's college fund on knives like ESEE and TOPS options.  Check out the OKC Ranger Afghan 5&#34; blade or the RD 6 and other larger blades.  They're coming at you w/.25&#34; thick 5160 spring steel blades, with micarta handles, better hardware for the scales, and a better/immediately usable sheath.<br /><br />For a few bucks more than the BK2 (or others in the BK series) you may need to sharpen some of the OKC knives out of the box but you get more value dependent upon your needs. The OKC RD series also gives you a great pommel striking surface which has a lanyard slot below the gripping surface vs. the hole in the handle section of the BK2. Another plus is that they have gimping along the spine for controlled finer work and this has always been missing (but very much desired by many) on the BK2. If you're looking for a tanto tip then the OKC RD Tanto is just that.....tanto tipped as many may prefer for tip strength and severely more puncture capability/durability. The OKC RD series knives also boast 5160 spring steel that gives them some of the most durable blades out there. They also have OKC Bush/Ranger series options w/1095 HC blades and w/thinner 0.185&#34; blades. I think 1095 HC is great steel but when you're looking for durability that you can beat to hell then you cannot go wrong w/the 5160 upgrade in this price range. I also like the OKC nylon sheaths because you get snaps (a plus over the old Velcro) and you get a piggybacked/buckled sheath on the front that I use for my smaller finer work/skinner/gut hook knife.<br /><br />Bottom-line: You will not go wrong with this knife anymore than you will with knives that cost 2 to 3 times as much. This thing is badass and there's no getting around that fact. You also will not go wrong w/the OKC knives I mention. If you get micarta scales for your BK2 then the OKC RD options are already cheaper for you....and if you get into time/effort/money to fix the BK2 sheath issues, well, there's no contest and at that point you can buy an ESEE w/out a sheath.  If you want to check out some of the OKC knives (w/kydex sheath options too) then you can check them out at Chestnut Ridge Knife Shop. Good luck and happy hunting/surviving.

B003O86FMW|4.0|Starts slowly but builds suspense well. The tension of the conflict between the capital and the district intensifies until the ending that is not an ending, but rather an invitation to a final resolution. If you liked book one, I think you'll like this one, too.
B00530FD54|5.0|P.G. Wodehouse is the only human being who can consistently induce laughter of the highest therapeutic quality. He is the master of plot, tone and comedic tension. His resolutions are always brilliantly satisfying. The underlying structure of his tales are tight and ingenious. One's appreciation of his structure only increases the hilarity.<br /><br />I'd recommend Right Ho, Jeeves to anyone who is stressed out and in need of strong drink. Instead of liquor, curl up in some quiet corner and give yourself over to the Never Never Land of Bertie Wooster and his all-wise Epictetus, Jeeves. It will remind you that even if all is not well in your world, you can always escape, if only temporarily, into a territory of soi disant comedic perfection.<br /><br />Who but P.G.W. could provoke gales of l. on every p? Do yourself a favour. Get this book and read it. Surrender to its inimitable charms. All your cares and woes will evaporate. You will return to the daily push with renewed vim & vigor.

I thought that I would thoroughly enjoy it. However, it was better than I thought it would be. This book provides a great overview of the glamour, creativity, charisma, and uniqueness of Michael Jackson the King of Pop. I recommend it for anyone who admires Michael and anyone who is interested in fashion, especially in the entertainment industry. This is an ideal book for your cocktail table or the bedside table in a guest room. Thank you, Michael Bush.
B0031Q0XCA|3.0|My wife put it best right after watching the movie, \\"I've already started to forget that I watched it.\\"<br />I was reminded of Pretty in Pink. But I won't say why because I hate spoilers.<br />This is the kind of movie youngsters can watch and find something meaningful in.<br />If you've grown past your earliest ideas of romance from High School then the minimum acceptable levels of comedy might sustain you.<br />The back and forth timeline was interesting, but only in so far as to shake and stir the mediocre movie enough to confuse you long enough to give in and watch it to the end.<br />This is an ok movie if you have gobs of time to spare, but if time is of the essence, watch something else for a dollar or two more-<br />then you'll save yourself our final thoughts, \\"Wish we watched something else.\\"

0399160450|5.0|One star was automatic being a Clancy fan.  Threat Vector is very well researched, and should be a warning to all of us on Mainland China's capabilities with cyber war.  A cyber attack coupled with an EMP weapon would cripple the United States as China executes a back door swing attack in the South Pacific and Taiwan while holding the US hostage.  We need to pay attention.<br /><br />Threat Vector was hard to read-slow, ponderous, more so than his earlier books.  I actually almost quit reading it a few times.  Such a novel should have short chapters and paragraphs with the action moving along at a fast clip.  To me, that was a big flaw with Threat Vector.<br /><br />The 5 stars support the research about a real threat we face if we don't defend ourselves against cyber war.  China sends thousands of students to college in the US and most go back bringing with them our technology.  They are brilliant-patient, and wrote the book on the art of war.  This book is a wake up call.

B00A8KJN14|5.0|When Tim Burton does something original, and not just a re-make of someone else's idea, it can make for a truly great and original film as is the case with Frankenweenie.<br /><br />This wonderful film is a homage to the low budget horror and science fiction \\"B Films\\" of the 1950 and 1960s such as Dracula, Wolfman, the Mummy and Godzilla.<br /><br />For those who have never seen the original versions of those films some of the inside jokes, and there are a number of them in this film, might be lost on you. Those inside jokes had me constantly giggling and laughing while my wife, who had not seen any of those films before, didn't understand why I was giggling and laughing at times.<br /><br />Tim often displays a macabre sense of humor and that can be seen here in this film as it was in Corpse Bride. If you love Corpse Bride, as I do, you will love this film for the same reasons. The characters here are engaging and the storyline for the most part is very well done, although there are a few missed opportunities for character development and interaction such as with Victor and the neighbor girl.<br /><br />From a graphic and technical perspective this film will also not disappoint. The graphics are extremely clear and crisp in blue ray, even though they are in black and white or shade of grey, which is very appropriate to the feeling and atmosphere of this film. The sound is also excellent as well and Danny Elfman's score is darn good and very appropriate to the film as well.<br /><br />The only negative point in this film for both my wife and I was the all too Disney style ending. I don't want to spoil it for you so will leave it up to you to see what I mean.<br /><br />I for one hope Tim will continue to make animated films of this caliber and not re-trench back to doing re-makes of other peoples original films as he did with Planet of the Apes, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Alice in Wonderland. While they were interesting films they were not great as Frankenweenie is.<br /><br />Highly recommended - especially to you Baby Boomers out there!
B000FVQLRA|5.0|The Pianist (2002) was directed by Roman Polanski and earned several Academy Awards including Best Actor (Adrien Brody), Best Screenplay, and Best Director. It was also nominated for Best Picture, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, and Best Costume Design.<br /><br />Wladyslaw Szpilman (Brody) is a twenty-seven year old accomplished pianist living in Warsaw with his family when Poland is attacked by Germany in 1939. The occupiers quickly introduce harsh regulations for the Jewish population eventually leading to their forced resettlement into the sealed ghetto district. Wladyslaw and the Szpilman family are forced to deal with the horrific realities of living in the ghetto. In the summer of 1942, most of the ghetto inhabitants including the Szpilmans are loaded onto trains headed for the Treblinka extermination camp, however Wladyslaw is saved by a sympathetic Jewish policeman. He is sheltered by several Poles until the Germans level Warsaw following the 1944 Uprising. Szpilman hides in the ruins where he is discovered by a German officer who surprisingly assists the starving fugitive. The Red Army \\"liberates\\" Warsaw in January 1945 and survivor Szpilman is once again able to perform for audiences.<br /><br />This is a superb film. The true story of Szpilman's survival in the midst of the world coming down around him is gut wrenching and compelling. Brody's performance is a tour de force. Beautiful Emily Fox gives an extremely sweet performance as Dorota. Don't blink or you'll miss several cameos from some very notable Polish actresses: Joanna Brodzik is the \\"woman shot in the head,\\" Maja Ostaszewska is the \\"woman with child,\\" and sassy Katarzyna Figura plays Szpilman's anti-Semitic Polish neighbor.<br /><br />Polanski, a Holocaust survivor himself, reveals in the bonus special feature, A Story of Survival, that several of his own personal memories of the Holocaust are included in the film. Are human beings really capable of such horror? Some parts of the film may be controversial for general viewers including scenes showing some Jews profiting from the ghetto, the Jewish Police collaborating with the Nazis, and anti-Semitic Poles but credit Polanski for not shying away from historical accuracy. The score, which includes several songs by Chopin, is marvelous. The Pianist is a Polish-French-German-British co-production and was filmed mainly in Warsaw.<br /><br />Although there were no references to it in the film, pianist Szpilman often accompanied singer Vera Gran in ghetto cabarets. He later accused Gran of collaborating with the Nazis. Szpilman's son tried to legally block the publication of Gran's biography, Vera Gran: The Accused (2012), which includes her counter-accusation that Szpilman participated in the deportation of Jews to Treblinka as a member of the Jewish Police.<br /><br />It may interest viewers of this film to know that anti-Semitism is unfortunately still very popular in Poland where it has deep roots. As just one example, a recent book by Polish historian Ewa Kurek, \\"Polish-Jewish Relations 1939-1945: Beyond the Limits of Solidarity\\" (2006), claims Polish Jews welcomed the Nazis and the forced resettling into sealed urban ghettos as an opportunity to create their own \\"autonomous provinces\\" separate from the Catholic Poles. She states that Jews were the ones who financed and built the walls around the ghettos to keep the hated Poles out. According to Kurek, Jews initially celebrated their cozy life in the ghettos safe behind their walls while the Polish Catholic intelligentsia was largely wiped out by the Nazis without a single helping hand from the satisfied, ghetto-dwelling Jew. It was only in 1942, writes Kurek, when the Germans began transporting the ghetto population to death camps, that the Jews realized they had been duped by their Nazi friends. Yes, this popular book is the kind of anti-Semitic filth that is still resonates with many Poles.e controversial for general viewers including scenes showing some Jews profiting from the ghetto, the Jewish Police collaborating with the Nazis, and anti-Semitic Poles but credit Polanski for not shying away from historical accuracy.

B00BEZTMQ8|3.0|This film shows clearly what happens when the commercial needs of 3D, coupled with a director's too enthusiastic fascination with playing with new technology, imposes itself over normal 2D. This film series seems to be following in the same exact steps of the mediocre Star Wars prequel trilogy, where special effects also overwhelmed the character part of the story and took over.<br /><br />In order for 3D to be viable and worth doing there must constant action of a specific eye popping variety that looks good in 3D. This is the reason that 3D does not lend itself easily to character driven films which is why you see so few dramatic films in this format. For those who only care about action, and pay little attention to the characters and their dialogue, this is your film.<br /><br />The strength of Peter Jackson's original Lord of the Rings film trilogy was the often dramatic character interaction and how that evolved over time. That is almost totally lacking here in this film. Both my wife and I found the constant \\"rollercoaster\\" ride imposed on the storyline tiring and much to the detriment of the overall film.<br /><br />In addition it was very clear to both of us that the director had vastly padded the film out with unnecessary side stories in order to justify having three films when, if he had stuck to the book, two films would have been more than sufficient. Those who have read and loved the original Hobbit book will find themselves constantly scratching their head and asking \\"where did that segment come from?\\" with this film.<br /><br />Technically from a special effects only perspective the film is excellent, as you would expect these days. It is in the script and character dialogue that this film really comes up short. BTW in viewing this film on my HD flat screen I did not see any problems with 48 FPS versus 24 FPS issue much mentioned in the press.<br /><br />I don't know if Peter Jackson reads these reviews but if he does he is what I would tell him: Peter you can do better than this! Great films are story and character driven first. Everything else should only enhance that and is a distant second.<br /><br />One note for those who have kids. There are a number of decapitations and various \\"slicing and dicing\\" actions in the many battle sequences. If the enemy had been human instead of goblin or orc, the rating probably would have been an \\"R\\" instead of the PG13 given to this film.<br /><br />I can only hope the other two films in the series will be better. Because of all of this I award this film 3 stars, although if it had been allowed I would have given it 3-1/2.

B001GZ6QEC|5.0|After \\"Changing The Game\\" that comes with making comic book Films in \\"Batman Begins\\" (2005), Christopher Nolan once again delves deep into Bruce Wayne's own tortured psyche and focuses the story on his own motivations for fighting crime as Batman in \\"The Dark Knight\\" (2008).<br /><br /> What can I say that hasn't already been said about this film? The acting performances are great, the IMAX SHOTS are excellent, Heath Ledger's Joker was quite simply hypnotic, Aaron Eckhart's Harvey Dent/Two Face was inspired, it fell in line with Jim Loeb and Tim Sale's \\"The Long Halloween\\" Comic Book. Eckhart's \\"Dent\\" wants to make Gotham safe for all its citizens and means business when it comes to Law and Order.<br /><br />The best part about Nolan's  \\"Dark Knight\\" is the fact that we get to see Harvey's own gradual but personal descent into madness. Even his own \\"flipping of the coin\\" motif is vital to Harvey and his character even before his transformation is complete. Christian Bale's Batman is once again on par (if not better) than he was in \\"Batman Begins\\"! Even though his \\"Bat Growl\\" makes him sound like he's got Throat cancer, Bale brings a seriousness to Batman, one that is welcomed among Bat-fans, like myself. We also see the tragic downfall of Batman as well, as his actions to save Gotham actually have real consequences for many its citizens, especially Rachel.<br /><br /> Michael Caine once again provides the suitable heart of the film as Alfred Pennyworth.  Alfred remains as the conscience of Bruce, and his warnings to him about being Batman provide some real weight and foreshadowing for the entire film's plot.<br /><br />  In Addition, Maggie Gyllenhall is very good as Rachel Dawes (even though I though that Katie Holmes was better in the role). I felt that she brought a warmth and cadence to her performance. Rachel clearly wants what's best for Bruce, despite the fact she can no longer wait for Bruce to resign as Batman. Morgan Freeman once again delivers as Lucius Fox. Freeman brings an excellent sense of comic relief (Caine does the same with Alfred as well). Fox supplies Bruce with a cool new Bat-suit that is both more flexible and grounded in reality.<br /><br />Other Notable Actors include Michael Jai White(who does a fine job as Gambol despite his small amount of screen time; blink and you might miss him), and Eric Roberts who does an equally excellent job as Sal Maroni. Roberts brings a \\"old style\\" flair to his performance, giving audiences the vibe of a distinguished Mob boss in a similar style, yet different way from Tom Wilkinson's Carmine Falcone in \\"Batman Begins\\"(2005).<br /><br /> David S. Goyer and Jonathan Nolan's story is well done, which pits Batman against an enemy that he can't \\"fully understand\\". The plot twists and turns make this film truly enjoyable to watch over and over again, and each time I see  it, the movie itself still feels fresh and new, even five years since its theatrical release. The Interrogation scene between Batman and Joker is an example some of the greatest conflict dialogue ever put on film.<br /><br /> My favorite scene in the film is still when Joker interrupts the \\"broad daylight\\" mob summit! \\"If we don't deal with this now...Soon...Little Gambol here, wont be able to get a nickel for his grandma.\\"-The Joker says during the summit. I love how he lies about his origin story to Gambol, Rachel, and even Batman himself during certain scenes in the movie, which is also in line with Joker's own \\"multiple choice origin story\\" aesthetic from the comics. Clearly Joker's arch in the film is to mess things up in Gotham, and break down Batman and Gotham's citizens, as well as destroying Harvey's reputation as the city's \\"White Knight\\".<br /><br /> The IMAX SHOTS (despite being few and far between in some moments in the movie)  bring a tremendous amount of drama and weight to the now iconic action and landscape scenes that have become synonymous with Nolan's \\"Batman\\" Trilogy. The  shots make me wish that the entire movie was shot in IMAX, instead of a 35 mm format with some special shots for good measure. My favorite IMAX sequence is when Joker is chasing Harvey's police convoy down the lower fifth street tunnel and the Tumbler joins the party! That was an amazing scene! Oh, and by the way, the Bat-pod is the coolest motorbike on two wheels. Don't leave home without it!<br /><br /> If you haven't seen this film, than what are you waiting for? This film wasn't just an \\"eye opener\\" for comic book films, it was the film that set the standard for future films in this genre, regardless of their characters, or their continuity. Nolan's \\"Dark Knight\\" was not just a good movie, but the centerpiece of a great Batman Trilogy. Without it, \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" would have no cause to exist. This is a movie that no fan should find themselves without.<br /><br />5 out 5 Stars! A Pure Classic!

B007J4T2G8|3.0|Doesn't deserve the hype. Not especially well-written. I suspect the titilation of a couple bdsm scenes overshadowed a rather weakly written psychodrama.

Actually if it wasn't for the last half hour when the SEAL team showed up I would say the movie was actually fairly good. The problem was the \\"climax\\" of the move was almost entirely dark. Every once in awhile there would be flashes of a view through night vision. But for the most part you are just watching a dark screen. I know what darkness is, I do not need to \\"see\\" it for 1/2 an hour. Maybe this was more dramatic in the theater, but not for watching at home. It ruined the movie in my opinion and everyone (we had 6 people over to watch it) were very glad when it was finally over.
B008B0QH5S|4.0|I've got to put my two cents worth in here.<br />I'm not a Pethead by any means. Did like some of their stuff that I happened to hear.<br />However, a few nights ago I watched their show, \\"Pandemonium, Live at the O2\\" that I had on PVR.<br />Wow! Blew me away. The staging, the music, just everything.<br />So checking the discography I bought Elysium - the newest work.<br />Now comes the strange part.<br />On first listen, I really didn't like most of the songs - found them downbeat and depressing - not at all like the Pandemonium show. However, gave it a second and third listen today, and I'm not kiddding, it seemed as if the album had transformed itself into something else! Now it seems positive and deep. I loved every track (well except maybe \\"Everything Means Something\\").<br />Quite an experience.<br />I've never had an album change that radically to my ears like that.
B00785P2QC|4.0|It's fun and kind of hard it a good game for the most part.<br />You'll find it kind of challenging.
B000OT8GCQ|4.0|I did not like how this book turned out!!!! This was not a disappointment but a bit unbearable at times.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Love this movie one thing why do all kid movies have to love<br />In movies but overall I thought this movie was great (I'm not very good at writing reviews)
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I am really enjoying this book.  I selected the 3 chapter read first, and I haven't wanted to put it down since.  And I'm not sure I would have chosen this book if I had known the subject matter, but it's so humanely described.  And a wonderful love story.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Great to get all 3 seasons to watch in a row.  Well done in direction and editing.<br />Actors are top in their field.
B004U8VX2M|4.0|Like most of the Masterpiece Theater productions this is very good. The relationship between the gentry and those that serve them is explored in a most interesting and dramatic way. The characters are delightful and the casting is outstanding. The writing is about as good as it gets in this medium. I did not see this series when it was originally telecast, but being able to watch the series now at my own pace adds to the enjoyment. I would highly recommend it.
B0018QCXH8|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie, you should give it a shot.  Great performances. Go to a movie review site for a real review.

B00328R21C|5.0|This was a gift. It was well received. Cool product if the kids like Star Wars and Legos. Millennium Falcon is next.
B007P6VM04|3.0|Very disappointed in this CD.  I actually thought it would have all the music that Bombshell has.  My bad for not waiting until Bombshell was released.
B000H4QD1O|5.0|I was so disappointed that this show had such a limited run.  What was Fox thinking?  After watching this wonderful series, I started the search for more Josh Weedon productions.
B0074VA2T2|3.0|This is a nice simple app for very beginning counting. The biggest draw back is that the same song plays over and over and over. It's a nice piece, but variety would be a plus!
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|I did enjoy the factoids about our nation's capitol and about the Masons but I don't know what is fiction or not. The book started great then just kinda fizzled, I think maybe I expected a bigger bang when it came time for the &#34;great reveal.&#34; Ehh.
B003O86FMW|5.0|my 20 yr old son recommended this series-so far great suggestion I highly recommend it. it's an easy read but great story.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I would have given a 5 star rating but for 2 things: First thing is the &quot;white noise&quot; sound that is used for the sleep mode. I found it t o be annoying, not soothing. The second thing is that the sleep mode couldn't be made to work with Pandora. Aside f r on these two complaints, everything functions as it should. Good app! Well worth the extremely high price of only $.99.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Great reading<br />Smacomber@myfairpoint.net income<br /><br />Could not stop reading. I wanted the story to continue ,can not wait to read the the next book. This book kept me o the edge of my seat.
B000SEGUDE|3.0|The reading of this novel came, for me, in a series of late-night, put-me-to-bed skiffs that, ultimately, did the finer points of the work an injustice as I rolled from wakefulness through the hazy in-between where one thinks one is awake but is not, really, then into full sleep. The characters and scope are immense and impressive. The interweaving of souls across time and the details that tie them together were, in many ways, lost on me. In the end, the Toynbee Convector ending felt a little heavy-handed and I failed to grasp the point of the soul or souls linked across the years. Beautifully writ, impressive characters and even more impressive handling of character voice and paradigm in the separate mini-stories. Will read again in full wakefulness in the hopes I glean more from the story's details and message.
B00BNWWVFG|5.0|Don't miss this fine film. Great performances from everyone: from Jude Law to the cameo of Peter Friedman. The screenplay is suspenseful and full of surprises. And as always Steven Soderburgh directs with class and integrity. They just don't make 'em like this anymore!!
B00AFROVQC|5.0|When I saw this book fo the first time I thought that it will be the same old fantasy book. But I was wrong. I am telling you, this book is different.<br /><br />This book has som fantasy and romance in it, but lets talk about the biggest theme first. Fantasy! This book starts off with a good setting. The boy lives with three brothers who are older and are all teasing and using him as a resource to train in order to enter the legion. He also has a useless dad who is helping the three brothers rather than the boy.<br /><br />Later in the book there are fantasy monster encounters and of course the boy saves the day. There is lost of magic and hidden messages in the book. I cant tell you more about the fantasy section of the story though, you will have to read that youself.<br /><br />There is also lots of Romance which makes it more exciting and ads a powerful twist to the story. The boy (His name is Thor by the way) eventually gets accepted by the king and becomes a member o the legion. He meets the Kings daughter and falls in love instantly. Same applies for the daughter, though it is rare for the daughter to take a liking to a boy. If you dont want to know to much about the book DO NOT READ THE REST OF THIS REVIEW!!!<br /><br />Right at the last few pages, the King beliefs that Thor is a traitor (Wont tell you why) and Gwen the daughter falls out with Thor (Wont tell you why that happens either).<br /><br />Surely a 5***** STAR Rating for this book, you have to read it if you are a fantasy and romance lover!<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------Visit my Youtube channel if you are interested in gameplay and other things: Mmoworld2013<br />Visit my website by clicking on the link on my youtube channel page.<br /><br />Thank You!!!

B007M45PMU|3.0|After hearing Hey Ho over and over on my local country and pop stations and on Saturday Night Live, I figured I had to have this album.  After Hey Ho... the rest of the music seems almost dijointed and of a lower production quality.  But that could be me.

B00BEZTMWW|1.0|Could not get the ultraviolet format to even download on my Apple products. I knew I was taking a risk on the format but did not expect such poor customer  service from Ultraviolet and Warner Brothers nor did I consider there would be such a high restocking free from amazon. Lesson learned, I will never buy DVD with Ultraviolet digital copy again.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Exciting, interesting and intelligent! Couldn't tear myself away. The writing, acting and action are amazing. Love the characters. Can't wait til next season.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|At first, I was skeptical about the story, thinking of the cliches and obviously how it would end. I was wrong! It was great!! I loved everything about this story!
B00BQUUH7E|5.0|If only it had stayed at 0.99 but whatever when a games this fun it's worth it. I had been waiting for a game like this to pop up. It has a somewhat easy control scheme but hard to perfect. It has a lot of different characters and they all play alot differently. The split screen is fun especially on the kindle. It has a nice twist to a hockey game. What is that twist, it is an actual amazing hockey that seems like the developer put in the time to make this a well polished game that seems like it's as fun as NHL games. This is a game that you can either pick up and play or play for a long time in one go. With the tournament mode and split screen this is a game you'll keep coming back to play.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|This perfect kids movie great comedy and enjoyable to for all ages love how they protraded each character must watch
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|Being from Pennsylvania, my opinion may seem biased to some.  The hard hitting sounds are here, and when you want to tone it down and go for the softer side, you can find some slower ones as well.  Also, if you listen to your music for the message, then you will thoroughly enjoy this cd. Being from Pennsylvania, my opinion may seem biased to some.

B00B2YH7BS|5.0|As both a musician and performer who spent the late 80's and 90's in the Valley Music Scene, and growing up on the great recordings of the period like Fleetwood Mac's Rumours and Tom Petty's Damn The Torpedoes, this documentary moved me personally and emotionally.<br /><br />Expertly shot and edited, well-written and with a true passion for his subject, Dave Grohl has given us a slice of history that thanks to him and his team, plus all the great recording artists and people who made Sound City what it was, will live on forever in our hearts and on our turntables (and I-Pods!)<br /><br />Thanks Dave for a great film - one of my most treasured!

B00BFUUMO8|3.0|Good: great variety of dinosaurs.  I even had to look up a few of them! Great time killer too. BAD: some of the more iconic dinosaurs cost real money to obtain.  I thought that was lame.  If you want the T-rex, be prepared to cough up 50 bucks.  If they fix that I'll give it 5 stars.

I AM NOT SURE IF IT IS MY CONNECTION OR COMPUTER. IT ALSO DOESN'T COME IN FULL SCREEN. I HAD TO HOOK IT UP TO MY TV FOR BETTER SOUND QUALITY EVEN THOUGH I HAVE SPEAKERS TO CONNECT TO MY COMPUTER.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|As a rule, the best place to go for reliable history is a first-person account.  Get the story from the people who were actually there.  This book fits that rule.  The author's skillful writing and story-telling ability just makes it better.

B009AOFNU4|3.0|For $80, I'd expect to be buying a controller that works well and plays every game I own seamlessly. At least the first part of that sentence is true for the SteelSeries Bluetooth gamepad.<br /><br />There's a lot of things to really appreciate about this controller. It's compact and well-formed, easily portable and feels solid in the hand. Setting it up and using it is a breeze. The instructions were easy to follow and everything I needed to charge it and get it ready came with it. Connecting it to Bluetooth on my Android tablet was a breeze - surprisingly, delightfully easy.<br /><br />And then I was ready to play some games - or so I thought.<br /><br />As it turns out, NONE of the games I had installed on my tablet previously were compatible with the SteelSeries gamepad. Bard's Tale? Nope. Temple Run? Negative. Galaxy on Fire? Nuh-uh. Defender? No bueno. Angry Birds, anyone? Out of luck. Words with Friends? YES! No wait...doesn't work either.<br /><br />I hunted down the list of the games that the SteelSeries gamepad is compatible with (not hard to find, it's on their website) and it's not a long list, and with the exception of GTA3, mostly arcade-style shooters and pinball games. Not a problem - I love both of those types of games.  I found a few promising candidates and downloaded them. Once I had them installed, configuring each to work with the SteelSeries gamepad was quick and painless, and I was soon shooting my way through asteroid fields and alien hordes again.<br /><br />Some games may develop compatibility for this controller down the road - it's good enough that i can see it happening, potentially. But for now, if you're considering this, make sure to check if it's compatible with any of the games you play, or you may be shelling out a lot of your hard-earned for something you can't/won't use.<br /><br />The upshot here is that this is a very easy to use controller and well-designed. Even though it's small, I don't have much problem using it with my big paws, and it feels natural to use it. But there's a price to be paid - literally. $80 is a hefty price to pay for a controller that only works on a fairly limited set of games thus far.<br /><br />I used this controller with a Dell Streak 7 Android tablet, and played several games with it.ig paws, and it feels natural to use it.

B0000VD04M|4.0|Tim Burton had a knack for picking a perfect cast for Ed Wood. I had heard of Ed Wood the man who &#34;won&#34; the title  of worst director. Johnny Depp was good as Ed Wood, the eager film, director,writer,actor. Martin Landau won a well deserved Oscar for his role as Bela Lugosi. this movie can be downright hilarious with Eds attempt to film his dream movies such a Plan nine from outer Space.the horrible mistakes he left in each movie.  I found it touching to see how Ed befriended Bela Lugosi toward the end of that actor's life.Tim Burton is good at those &#34;off the beaten path&#34; movies. this one is a good one.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|Anyone who really sharpens knives knows that the angle at which an edge is sharpened is a key factor in obtaining a real cutting edge as opposed to a blunt object. Most of my knives are sharpened at 25 degrees while heavy-duty knives are sharpened normally around 30 degrees. The thinner the blade, the steeper the sharpening angle.<br /><br />My EDC knife is an old Uncle Henry Schrade LB3 that I have carried around for about 20 years; it is razor sharp. My backup knife is a Gerber \\"FAST\\" and is sharpened to about 20 degrees.<br /><br />Using this sharpener effectively dulled the blade of the LB3 to the point where my EDC would not slice paper. I turned to the Smith's DCS4 - 4\\" Diamond Combination [[ASIN:B00009YV6L Smith's DCS4 4-Inch FINE & COARSE Diamond Combo Sharpening Stones]]; albeit a larger sharpening system, and within a minute the blade was again razor sharp. The Smith's DCS4 - 4\\" Diamond Combination [[ASIN:B00009YV6L Smith's DCS4 4-Inch FINE & COARSE Diamond Combo Sharpening Stones]] can be stashed in a cargo pant's pocket, briefcase, back pack or other carrying gear. I agree that the \\"Pocket Pal\\" is small enough to store just about anywhere, but I look at it as a gadget and not a serious sharpening tool. This is my opinion and I'm sticking to it.<br /><br />Seriously, if you want a mediocre cutting edge for your knife, continue on with this product. If you learn to use the angles and techniques for serious sharpening, better systems are at hand and smith's is an excellent product. I use the [[ASIN:B000O8OTKA Smith's DFPK Diamond Precision Knife Sharpening Kit]] for most of my sharpening work and I have other, more serious, tools for obtaining finer edges up to 15 degrees.
B000ICXQHE|5.0|I love Denzel Washington's movies. Unlike most cop movies, this one is low on violence and has no car chase scenes. Clive Owen is a smart bank robber who has figured out how to out-smart the cops. This movie is a clever &#34;how is this going to work out?&#34; suspense movie.  Can you figure out how the bank robbers plan to escape with the money?

B003F1WM2K|5.0|I never followed Patti Smith or Robert Mapplethorpe closely but was always aware of them since they first garnered fame.  Patti's well-written epilogue on their remarkable relationship was a real eye-opener. The book is both a Whitmanesque prose poem about New York as the epicenter of social and artistic reformation in the early seventies and a lesson in how to build a lasting, cross-gender friendship. &#34;Friendship&#34; doesn't really describe the multi-faceted relationship that was crucial to their development as artists and human beings. The last third of the story is lyrical and moving.  Loved it.
B007KWD7BK|1.0|I bought this album based on the many positive reviews and boy was I wrong. I love heavy music (Slayer, Megadeth) and I really enjoy the psycadelic heavy metal (Monster Magnet, Black Mountain, Graveyard) and I was hoping for something in the middle. This album is garbage....the same boring riff for over an hour. I've already traded it in to my local record shop and got something in return for it. This isn't heavy, it's just plain stupid. I would have more fun poking my eye out than giving this record another listen. Do yourself a favor and pass on this one!

B009IEXKXI|5.0|I read this book from start to finish in one day simply because it was too engaging to put down and read later. As an avid reader of many literary styles including sci-fi I very much enjoyed this story from various levels. With a background in Geology and having studied Mars as a graduate student I followed this story from the perspective as a reader as well as one familiar with the terrain Mark, the storyteller, dealt with on his way to being rescued.<br />I would not hesitate to recommend this book to my fellow teachers as well as their students - high school and above. In fact I can see a literature unit using this book along with the many online resources about Mars to track his journeys on Mars.<br />And for 99 cents this book was very well worth it.

B004J4WNL2|5.0|Self-described introvert Susan Cain speaks out to bring us Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talking (Random House; ISBN 0307352153, ASIN B004J4WNL2), a tome that resonates with and validates introverts. Describing the rise of the “Extrovert Ideal”, Cain also defines these two oft-misunderstood psychological terms, and asks how and from where such fundamental character traits arise, and what they are likely to do for—and to—their possessor.  Cain briefly examines introversion across cultures, and finishes with some illuminating helps for intertype communication, along with ways introverts can best harness their unique gifts.<br /><br />As a deep introvert myself, I found the book quite fascinating, and many of its concepts resonating strongly with me.  I’ve read some other works on personality types before, but this is the first major book of which I’m aware that sticks strictly to introversion and that is targeted at a popular audience.  While I’m not sure that it is likely to appeal to extroverts as much as it is to those of us who appreciate the validation it gives, I found there to be some interesting ideas in terms of how the two types of people can better communicate, including, for example, specific suggestions for introverts at work and for the extrovert parents of introvert children.  Nevertheless I’m conscious that some of the introvert cheerleading could be interpreted as extrovert bashing, and as such would be very interested to hear how extroverts perceive this work—there is value to it for such people, for as Cain argues, “if you’re not an introvert yourself, you are surely raising, managing, married to, or coupled with one.”<br /><br />Cain covers several of the numerous definitions for introversion before settling on a fairly standard working one for the rest of the book.  But while part of this is a careful explanation that introversion and shyness are not the same, this fact sometimes seems forgotten throughout Quiet, which appears to set successful public speaking as the highest ideal to which introverts should aspire.  I first recognized myself as an introvert when I heard a University of Utah psychologist suggest that such a person may actually be very competent in social situations, but will also be mentally or emotionally drained by their stimulation, and require solitude to recharge again.  This is the essence of Cain’s working definition, and while it is definitely me, I am not shy and I really enjoy public speaking.  With this perspective in mind however, I derive from Quiet that introversion is not a one-dimensional characteristic, or even one end of a personality spectrum: it is different things to different people, each of whom must take his own approach in adapting to the extroverted society in which Cain persuasively argues we live.<br /><br />Her term for this is the “Extrovert Ideal”, which she argues grew up in the early 1900s as the “man of action” became more prized than the “man of contemplation”, initially through the efforts of public-speaking icons like Dale Carnegie and others who held that “all talking is selling and all selling involves talking.”  As Cain readily admits, this ideal is particularly prevalent in the US, and while she gives a high-level contrast with a generic Asian culture that she says still prefers quiet contemplation, this is one area of the book I felt could have used some expansion.  For example, when citing studies that reveal one in two or three Americans is actually introverted, Cain somewhat reasonably concludes that “Given that the United States is among the most extroverted of nations, the number must be at least as high in other parts of the world.”  Though Americans are the prime audience for Quiet, I would have liked to read more about the breakdown in other parts of the world, and would have liked more than just the chapter about Asian-Americans in Part Three, “Do All Cultures Havean Extrovert Ideal?”<br /><br />Indeed, as a current student of global negotiations, I read this book in part seeking insight on best practices among cultures for integrating introverts.  Nevertheless, I found several interesting takeaways that could be applied in a negotiating context.  One such recurring theme in the book is learning to harness just what the subtitle indicates: the power of introverts, which is obviously substantial.  Introverts should be aware of their own strengths, and while most American introverts have already developed sophisticated mechanisms for faking extroversion (a necessity in a society that so values open office plans—which “have been found to reduce productivity and impair memory”—glad handing, and backslapping), others will want to be able at least to promote their particular abilities to those superiors who choose the members of a negotiating team.  For example, Cain tells of a Harvard Business School student who, when playing the group-oriented “Survival Game”, a B-school rite of passage, allowed his extensive knowledge of survival to go to waste by not speaking up forcefully enough in a group of brash would-be leaders looking to make an impression; his group had a dismal finish.<br /><br />Cain also tells of her own experience as a young lawyer in a negotiation across the table from a group of hard-charging lawyers and executives: after the initial shock to her system of this overstimulating environment, she silently coached herself to play to her strengths: listening and asking intelligent questions to achieve understanding.  Where bluster had previously failed to make headway, Cain’s quiet perseverance reminded me of the important concept of mindfulness in negotiations, which requires a high level of focus on pre-identified goals, and a persistent mental “presence” at the table, made possible through unusual levels of concentration and focus.<br /><br />Indeed, real understanding at a deep level can be key to successful negotiations of all types, from the purely distributive, or zero-sum kind, to more cooperative, expand-the-pie type mediations.  In the first case, paying careful attention to the signals given by the other party during, and perhaps especially before, the negotiation itself, can give great insight on the most appropriate strategies to pursue.  While it makes intuitive sense that an extrovert full of bluff and bluster would be best positioned to do well in this type of negotiation, the careful observations of an introvert could be invaluable, as could the patience that often comes along with this personality type.  At the other end of the negotiation spectrum, each party’s ability to gain more from working together to arrive at a solution than they could get either going it alone or to the law relies in great measure on developing a solid understanding of the other party’s perspective, from its perception of the underlying issue to its goals for resolution.<br /><br />So while I regret that Quiet won’t likely do much to slow the relentless march of the Extrovert Ideal, there is much here for both introverts and extroverts, whether involved in formal negotiations or just those we all encounter in daily life.  For introverts in particular, the validation Cain gives is valuable, and the advice, split infinitives notwithstanding, is worth remembering: “your biggest challenge may be to fully harness your strengths… You have the power of persistence, the tenacity to solve complex problems, and the clear-sightedness to avoid pitfalls that trip others up.”
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I LOVE this game. I can't stop playing....my household chores are suffering..... It kinda sucks that some of the Dinos cost SO many game dollars; getting one with the dollars you earn at each level up is impossible, unless there were like 500 levels. You shouldn't HAVE to put in real money to finish the game. Oh well, it's still a blast!  :-)
B004I9CXHW|2.0|As others have mentioned, I was able to charge my phone with this cord but was unable to transmit any data from the phone to the audio system in my Volkswagen.  The audio system doesn't recognize that a device is connected.  I've resorted to just using bluetooth to transmit the data.  I haven't tried to use a USB flash drive at this point, so I'm not sure if that would be possible.

We were not rocked like we were with the original trilogy.  We are looking forward to the next movie...<br /><br />That said... it's well worth the rental price... but for us... until the price comes way, way down... we'll wait for the trilogy to come out for this 2nd series.

B008A1NSTG|4.0|I was looking for a good movie with no undue violence, sex or language that makes you squint with every other word. Sometimes the mind just needs to relax and let a movie carry you to a adequate conclusion. I like Drew Barrymore as an actress so I was happy to watch her hope never say die attitude she brought to this film. It has a yes, hurrah, we can do this if we all cooperate and work together. It's a good movie choice when you are needing a little something to kick start that hope again and realize everyone can learn something from someone else. I recommend it as a family friendly move. :)

The horse was beautiful and the movie showed how horses suffered during the war times.  I liked the ending and all of the characters.  The music was great also.  I would see this movie again.

B00AYHKIZ6|2.0|The first couple songs ok, \\"Where Are We Now\\" is beautiful and a great hook to buy the album, but then he starts to whine and moan: \\"Who ever thought a small town girl would be the boss of me?\\" Where did he write that? on the toilet? and then think it was so cool so pushed it by his producers? What is the difference between someone like Bob Dylan who continues to play year round and write songs, almost all of his songs tight and well rehearsed versus Bowie, who has not been in practice for a long time, he is simply not ready. Perhaps his next album will be better if he does not wait another 10 years. \\"Dancing face to face, dancing out of space?\\" How profound! \\"I'd rather be high\\"? wow! Is this all you have? And yet so many great reviews here on Amazon and by pros. Nowadays beauty and art are no longer a personal choice, most people buy into the marketing hype and like what others like, or what corporations push, instead of listening to truly good music. Sadly I was a huge Bowie fan growing up and following his wisdom of being a teenage runaway. But I won't be listening to much of this album, thank you.

B00BHU2A7I|5.0|This film centers on the life of Alfred Hitchcock (Anthony Hopkins) and his wife Alma (Helen Mirren) during the production of \\"Psycho.\\" In many ways it was more about her than him. The couple turned in Oscar worthy performances. The film showed us how Hitchcock immersed himself into the production, balancing his professional and personal life.<br /><br />The film was masterfully written and directed utilizing the famous Hitchcock wit, sexual innuendos, profile, music, and asides.<br /><br />How great is this film? Consider the fact that Jessica Biel accepted a tertiary female billing just to be in it. James D'Arcy played an excellent Anthony Perkins and Scarlett Johansson did not disappoint as Janet Leigh. This is a must for Hitchcock fans as it shows \\"the master\\" in a good human light. The climax scene of Hitchcock in the theater viewing the audience during the showing of his film was worth the price of the DVD alone.<br /><br />I was however disappointed to find out the script writers missed on a factual point. Janet Leigh famously wore a flesh colored body suit during the shower scene. Her breast could not have possibly have shown in any film frame that needed to be edited. What were they thinking?<br /><br />Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.

The acting is phenomenal, the plot is well written, but most importantly it teaches us about mental illness and how it can effect an entire family. The stigma around mental illness is lessening but it still exists, and I applaud any director and actor that makes an attempt to showcase just how real a disease this is. Definitely worth watching.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|So i bought a 500plus page series deciding i would let myself enjoy it in my free time. Instead here it is well past 3 am and i was so anxious to see how it ended i was skimming pages.  Now i am determined to read it again in my free time to read what i missed in my mad dash to see how it ended.<br /><br />Now my actual review! Obviously i think this is a gem of a read. The characters are vibrant and tangible. Perspectives change but it only adds to the meat of the story.  Its a post apocalyptic story with some very interesting twists. I couldn't recommend this series more.  What a talented story teller and what a fantastic story!

B00BOLE7X0|4.0|Lincoln is a docu-drama that focuses on the 16th President's tumultuous final months in office. In a nation divided by war, Lincoln pursues a course of action designed to end the war, unite the country and abolish slavery.  This movie was not quite what I expected as I thought it would focus more on the civil war but instead focused more on showing the politics of both winning the war and winning the peace.  Daniel Day Lewis was excellent in this movie, a surprising choice I thought at the time but he does a convincing if not historically accurate portrayal of Lincoln.  Sally Field also does a convincing job of playing the distraught first lady.  Although at times, the movie seems to crawl along and be a bit too long, it is overall an excellently made movie and worth a watch.

B005LAII80|5.0|This film is a vast improvement over the big budget Stalone version and is very close to the original character portrayed for over 40 years in 2000AD and Judge Dredd magazine. Karl Urban was born to play Dredd. He has every perfected every nuance and even the body language of Dredd - all of this without ever once taking off the helmet!<br /><br />For Dredd fans this film is a huge hit and I've watched it several times since buying the bluray disk - it never gets stale. Sadly in the States the public are not familiar with the Dredd character so it wasn't the mega-hit it deserved but if you enjoy action, dark humor and bleak futuristic settings, this is the film.<br /><br />Judge Anderson is also brilliantly portrayed as the Rookie judge coming to terms with the brutality of the job. While Dredd is already a granite faced veteran, Anderson starts the film with doubts and moments of hesitation. In effect this is a &#34;coming of age&#34; story and again the actress (Olivia Thirlby) has nailed her character brilliantly.<br /><br />The only limitation on this film is budget; there are a few moments we are reminded this film was made on limited funds, however I am reminded of Pitch Black which in many ways owes its brilliance to the same combination of excellent actors and script-over-budget excellence.<br /><br />I can only hope that somehow everyone on this film gets picked up to make a bigger budget sequel. There are many rich stories in the Dredd magazine, and many which reflect on society today.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Loved this book with all the characters flaws and all!  Theirs was a definite maze and struggle of a love story but they made it work in the end.  Lots of obstacles kept them apart but the friendship that started at the beginning kept them thinking of each other through it all.

B00BOLE7X0|4.0|This movie is very well done but it is very slow in the middle. I had to watch the movie in 3 parts to stay awake. If you are thinking of turning off the movie because you are bored then skip to the last 45 minutes or so. The movie is also very dark. Similar to \\"John Adams\\" which I enjoyed very much. If you like the shows on the History Channel then you will enjoy this movie.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|I saw the movie before reading the book, and expected the story to be the same, with a little more detail.  It was hard reconciling the book's much older Tiffany with the youthful Jennifer Lawrence, although Bradley Cooper was the perfect &#34;Pat&#34;.  Once I got past looking for the movie, I started to enjoy the book as it was written.  So it ended up being a familiar but new story, set in a place I'd visited with people I'd met.  So if you've already seen the movie, don't let that keep you from reading the book, and vice versa.  The message is the same...there is a silver lining, somewhere, so keep looking.  I thought it's treatment of those who suffer from depression was enlightening and respectful.  It presents the humanity which is behind what appears to be inappropriate or whacky behavior.  A good read, whether you are looking for depth or just a good story.

B00BEZTMWW|5.0|The Hobbit: An unexpected journey was excellent. The story line was close to the original writings. The opening scenes were captivating  and devastating. The fights with the goblins and  wargs and orcs were tremendous. I thoroughly enjoyed this one and anxiously await what's to come next.

0156012197|5.0|Best short story ever. No wonder this is the iconic story of the French people.<br />This particular volume includes a short blurb about the author and his history. This is important when drawing parallels between the author's life and the plot of the story.<br />It's a cute children's book, and an intriguing study of French society and ideals.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Amazing just amazing! Possibly the best book I have ever read in my whole entire life. I'm so amazed and in love!
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|I love the choice of music and musicianship on this album. Very easy to enjoy with rich and almost stunningly crisp and clear vocals. Nice combination of pace throughout, seems like a lot of good music for the money.<br />On a side note, I couldn't help but wonder what some Boz Scaggs/Lucinda Williams duets might sound like, since this is similar to some of her best earlier music like Car Wheels...
B0091REZMW|4.0|Enjoy playing the game.Can be confusing figuring out how to get ahead in the game. Need more energy,  have to come back to game after using all energy supplied.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|This is so much better than the usual hidden object games - it's got a good story line, it isn't too easy or too hard, &amp; it lasts a good long time for the money. Love it! More like this one, please.

B00BWJARHO|5.0|I decided to go ahead and rent this, and I am so glad I did. I can't wait until the sequel to this one comes out. Great movie
B0090SI4LU|3.0|First, let me say, I'm not a \\"Twi-hard.\\"  I don't have any interest in sparkly vampires and ripped werewolves.  And as a heterosexual male who is not a teenager, that's not too surprising.  But I did really love the novel \\"the Host.\\"  For me, the concept is sort of like \\"Dances with Wolves\\" or \\"Avatar.\\"  But instead of having a human run off to live with giant blue smurfs, here we have a protagonist who is truly alien and learns to become human.<br /><br />I think there are three problems with the film:<br /><br />1.  The thing that almost sunk the movie for me was the way the character of Melanie Stryder was manifested in Wanda's head.  I didn't mind the use of voice-overs, but I did mind the way that \\"Melanie\\" came across...sometimes, she sounded like a petulant 14 year-old and not the 20 year-old woman she was in the story.  When Saoirse Ronan was in Wanda mode, I found her mostly more convincing and otherworldly (although near the end, she started sounding like a typical human girl with weird contact lenses in her eyes instead of an alien being that had lived multiple lifetimes in different bodies over a thousand years).<br /><br />I really do wonder if it would have been a smarter thing to have cast an older actress in the role (perhaps if Jennifer Lawrence had been free she could have done it better).  I think Ronan is a beautiful woman and she's definitely talented as an actress but as I said, when she was in \\"jealous Melanie\\" mode, she came across as very young...and not particularly likeable.<br /><br />It also would have been smart to minimize the internal dialogue as much as possible and convey a lot of it with just Ronan's expressions and flashbacks.<br /><br />2.  The length of the novel (600 pages) really was important to sell the development of the character of Wanda/Wanderer...specifically, how she comes to love being human more than being a Soul and how she developed feelings for the character of Ian and how she also came to love Jared.  But the need to compress the story into something that is movie length (about two hours) resulted in a lot of the \\"depth\\" of the story falling by the wayside.  For example, we see Ian and Wanda \\"fall in love\\" but it seems mechanical and formulaic in the movie as opposed to touching as it was in the book.  Perhaps they should have split it into two films.<br /><br />&lt;spoilers><br /><br />Even worse, when Wanda decides she wanted to give Melanie back her body and die, the movie will leave anyone who hasn't read the book scratching their heads as to why she would make a crazy decision like that.  In the book, Meyer set the stage for that intention by showing how much Wanda blamed herself for the death of one of her human friends, Wes, and how guilty she felt over the Souls displacing the human race (which set up the death of another one of her friends, Walt, who is missing from the movie, who died an agonizing death in front of her due to cancer).<br /><br />&lt;end spoilers><br /><br />3.  Another thing that fell by the wayside that was key to the book being so compelling is that it was told by Wanda using \\"first person narrative.\\"  You really got insight into how Wanda was becoming human and how she came to care for the humans she was prisoner of.<br /><br />This said, the movie was worth seeing and some of the reasons why included:<br /><br />1.  Saoirse Ronan's \\"Wanda\\" most of the time did capture the \\"alien\\" nature of the personality that was in Melanie Stryder's body.<br /><br />2.  William Hurt did a good job playing Uncle Jeb.  I was a little surprised that Hurt, who I best associate with \\"Children of a Lesser God\\" and \\"the Accidental Tourist\\" did so well playing the grizzled Jeb.<br /><br />3.  The \\"world building\\" (i.e. bringing the sort of strange post-apocalyptic world of the \\"Souls\\" to life) was pretty good and really did call to mind what I read in the book. The cave complex was particularly impressive.<br /><br />4.  Diane Krueger did a good job playing Wanda'spursuer.<br /><br />&lt;spoilers><br /><br />5.  Emily Browning seemed to be well-cast as the new \\"host\\" for Wanda's personae.<br /><br />&lt;end spoilers><br /><br />So to sum up, I thought \\"the Host\\" was worth seeing since I loved the novel so much.  I know I will read any sequel Meyer writes, and I probably will watch the movie sequels sort of curiosity to see how they bring any future novels to life.<br /><br />I figure at the very least, we won't see Saoirse Ronan arguing with herself in those films.r.<br /><br /><spoilers><br /><br />5.

B00AU15HPC|4.0|The legendary voice and beautiful guitar playing is as fresh as ever.  Some great tunes,and very moving and a must for anyone even vaguely familiar with the Moody Blues incredible catalog.  The country flavored tunes are also very moving, as is the feeling of spiritual longing.  Its great listening and evokes many different feelings and vibes.  The only anomoly is the dance version of I Know Youre Out There Somewhere, which doesnt quite fit in the context of the others. So great to see new work from this gifted artist.

B009O5CLZY|5.0|This game is so fun! I have gotten so addicted to it, it's now my favorite game on my kindle fire!
B00A7CI82I|5.0|Great standalone action based on the Bourne series. Hope the series continues and remains separate from the Jason story unless Matt Damon returns to join forces with Aaron Cross to right the wrongs against the two of them.  Now there would be a story for the big screen!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was a real joy to read. For a person who is not the reader I couldn't put the book down.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|The first time I saw this movie, the only opened seats were waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay down front  For the great majority of time, we were staring into the nostrilx of the actors!  Slouching down into the seats isn't good for the spines and backs of seniors but a funny thing did occur.  Beause my head was rubbing against the back of the seat, I noticed in the ladies' room that my hair had turned somewhat!  Oh well, enjoyed the movie anyway.  The following week, I took my daughter to see the same show.  I had told her how crowdedi it was the day we went so we made sure t get there early.  Walked in and voila......seats everywhere!  So we watched and cried during the movie.<br /><br /> Eddie Redmayne gave a heartfelt performance especially with his &#34;Empty Chairs at Empty Tables&#34; and Samatha Barks is a true pro.  Her diction, phrasing, etc.were all spot on.  In fact, I saw Cameron MacKintosh on stage telling her she got the part====very well deserved.<br /><br />As I said in my title, everyone put forth very good work.  I only wish that Hugh Jackman had won the Oscar for his performance.  He's told in interviews about the regime he followed to gain the gaunt look of someone of that time.  However, I am glad to say he looked more like himself as the movie progressed.  My husband's watching the action hero singing very movingly and wondering how one man can be so versatile.  I agreed with him but already know how multi-talented Hugh Jackman is.<br /><br />I expect to watch this DVD again so I can keep identifying the people I know are somewhere in the production.  I know the guard was Hadly Frasier as soon as he opened his mouth (great voice).<br /><br />In closing, I felt this movie was a wonderful piece of work where the emotions were raw and all the actors played them to their strengths.  I highly recommend this movie.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Like a horror movie with plot lines.  Great actors. Hope it never ends and can't wait til next season. The best.
B0067R0APK|4.0|The app updated today. I liked the previous version better. The new layout seems cluttered and I can't change the color like I could in the other version.

B0074VA2T2|4.0|My 3-year old granddaughter liked it, but moved up the levels quickly. It might be a bit too simple for a 3-year old who can already count to 15.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Great movie with moral and emotional situations.  It's clearly a John Lassater movie as it reminded us of Toy Story and Cars
B00BKTWBMA|4.0|If you like Clapton, it is good, but not special.  Some reggie.  I am enjoying it.  Easy to download into itunes.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Works great on my kindle fire. My 5 year old laughs so hard at the one that poops out an egg. Great variation and beautiful graphics. It was free too and I don't get all those annoying ads popping up.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|this movie has an Adult Theme, and nudity, so be aware, you may want to keep the kids away until the proper age.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|Works great on my kindle fire. I have not had any issues with it so far. Easy to use. I would recommend it.
B005LAJ212|4.0|By the time I was nearing halfway through the season it became hard not to start laughing at the melodrama - the Baywatch beach side scenarios, the millionaire's parties - and yet - I continue to watch!  It's like a B-movie. \\"B\\" for bubbly.  Soapy bubbles!  Go Emily, vengeant bunny!

B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved this book. I cried near constantly, and read near constantly until it was over. I really hope that I can take some of this books lessons into my daily life with me. This is the kind of book that changes lives, the kind that makes you a better person.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|This is what an album is supposed to be. Popular music has been stale for a long time now, but not this one. Not this one. This one is fresh in an ol'school way. A Motown album for the modern era. Timbaland and Timberlake take this neo-soul sound to a new level with beats that HIT, smooth high vocals, and clever/complex song structure. This is not a common album for modern music (hence the lower ratings), I can see a lot of this albums brilliance going right over the heads of many people. But if you know how to listen to old school music, or you've been a fan of Timbaland, you'll be able to appreciate what this album does. Songs are long, tempos shift, and to a generation raised on simple repetitive song structures this album must be confusing and uncomfortable. This is far less of a R&B album as it is a soul/hip-hop fusion album. Timberlake doesn't do too much lyrically that will blow you away but his approach, that ranges from playful to deep expressions of love, always sounds fresh and carries the listener through the song and album. This is one of those albums where whether you like it or not, you can't deny they achieved exactly what they were going for. No missed opportunities here.<br /><br />To wrap up, I recommend The 20/20 Experience without reservation. Even if your not really comfortable with it yet, if you let it grow on you, you'll really enjoy it. All my homies at this point are bumping this album through the city. This is a music listeners album. Get it.

B007W8S2MG|4.0|I have never been a fan of JRPG's, and can not stand turn-based action games. But this game is a must own for anyone that is looking for an enjoyable ride. It starts off a bit slow but is interesting none the less. But once you get to fighting and the story gets deeper you find yourself hooked and without realizing your spending hours on your little handheld vita. The fight system is varied enough as well to have multiple play throughs and try different combos. I am not a Final Fantasy fan and I think this game is for those of us who couldn't care about FF and those games. If you enjoy anime, cool characters, funny dialogue, pick this game up. You wont regret this purchase. Its just a fun game to play end of story.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was very funny. I enjoyed the story, POV, and art. It was a real page turner! Can't wait for the next book. :D

0802473156|4.0|The principles behind the 5 love languages are sound. &#34;Love is a choice&#34; rings as an all-too-true theme throughout the book. Focusing on loving your partner they way they want to be loved can make a huge positive difference in the relationship. All of these areas are vital to keeping the relationship healthy.<br /><br />However, the book could have been half the length and still related most of the important material. &#34;Too wordy&#34; is my first criticism. My second is: back it up. There are great principles at work here, but where are the communicative or scientific principles/studies that show WHY these work? I know they exist--being a Communications student myself--and would have liked to see a bit more proof with the grand ideals.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Like being able to watch what is happening in the city.  Woud like the ability to pay coins for everything even if a high amount.  Would like more long term goals and less play-by-play goals.  Would like to be able to skip goals to erase them from the list.
B000001E3V|4.0|This is a terrific live album, capturing early Clapton in extended jamming with a great back-up band.  But part of what really made the Derek and the Dominos only album one of the all-time greatest albums was the dynamic between Eric Claption and Duane Allman.  Alas, without Duane one can only wonder &#34;what if?&#34;
B007N8RULO|5.0|I sure do love this game....keeps all of us entertained for hours...would definitely recommend this game to all my friends
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Good character development. Puts a scientific spin on the &#34;historical novel&#34; and then adds in witches daemons and vampires!  Worth the read as a beach book or vacation novel.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I overlooked the typos, which there are plenty of.<br />This was not 100% terrible, hence the one star. I did keep reading until I reached the end, the awful, unbelievable, how the heck do I wrap this up end.<br /><br />In the beginning, I sympathized with Nick. I couldn't stand Amy from her diary entries. I questioned whether I should be feeling this way when Andie comes about. I just didn't seem to care about it. I hated Amy the whole time, so for that, I give a star.<br /><br />The two thieves were mechanical, abandoned by the author, and Iwondered  why they never came back into the story. I also wondered why why why did Nick suddenly turn flat, sheepish and scared in the last section of the novel.  Here was this character that I was rooting for to nail this psycho to the wall, with his cheerleader sister and professor like detective on his side, and Flynn decides to strip his building balls of steel, and turn him into a weak character. It felt like the author gave up at the end, so she made her characters do the same.<br /><br />I felt suckerpunched at the end when you learn what Amy's hold over Nick is. Seriously? It's unbelievable that is what resolves Nick
B008X6N1OA|5.0|If you like the Ice Age movie, you will love this movie.  What makes it even better is the 3D effect.  It is hysterical.
B006H5120E|5.0|This movie has it all:  Leonardo, Kate, love, mystery, scandal, sorrow.  What more can you ask for?  Oh yea, and the 3D makes it seem like you are really there which make the tears even bigger.

B0079M8R6Q|5.0|This was an eye-opening book. We often hear about North Korea in the context of foreign relations: its provocations and threats. What isn't often told is the story of the North Korean people. It is a story of horror, severe poverty and hopelessness.<br /><br />The book was very well written and was an easy read, albeit a very sad one. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.
B000Y7U98W|5.0|great movie. really enjoy the visual and audio effects. plot is very interesting and at most times edge of the seat.

B00B81B0HC|5.0|Some of the songs I knew, some I didn't, but I'd say that there are only 1 or 2 tracks I'd consider &#34;filler&#34; and everything else is awesome.  Even the filler tracks are still pretty good.  This'll be a band to watch.
B0086221SS|1.0|Michell Williams brought the film down like the sinking of the Titanic. Her character was as though she had zero acting skills. I would not waste my time with this one.
B00AW8VUDG|5.0|Holy crap real rock n roll is still alive ! I was hesitant about this new release from Krokus but being a big fan I had to grab it up and Im glad that I did. Marc Storace is still in great form and amid all the controversy of his voice he still sounds like Bon Scott and while others hate it I have allways loved it !<br /><br />  In fact the first two songs sound just like something from ACDC back in the Bon Scott days and theres nothing wrong with that. This cd just pure rocks ya back to the days of good ole rock n roll, and thats a good place to be.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This was an excellent movie.  It was slow to start but quickly picked up I found the action scenes very good.<br />It's hard to say much about the movie with out giving away to  much and spoil the picture.

B000HC2LI0|5.0|We missed The West Wing when it first aired. We watched a few episodes on DVD recently; loved the concept, tight scripting and acting. Now, more than 10 years on from the first season, the show is still amazingly--and sadly sometimes agonisingly --topical. Now we have the entire series in one nicely presented and well organised boxed set. The price was well under a dollar per episode including shipping overseas. It was estimated to reach us in 4 to 6 weeks. We had it in about 7 days! Amazing price. Great product. Fantastic service.
B006X415GK|5.0|The doll arrive ahead of scheduled delivery date and was in excellent condition. Our girls love it.... and since it is a monster high the price was well below department store prices.<br />Will definitely order more.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I 've been using Evernote for years, for business and personal needs. I have scanned in family recipies which are now searchable, to lengthy white papers for work. I email pictures, web links and clips, right into Evernote. It's accessible on all of my devices everywhere. Now you can even do speech to text, all for free! Evernote has it all.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This is a game with great graphics and a most entertaining theme. Had HOURS of play already and if they update as promised , this game is a keeper.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This bag serves the purpose I need --- to carry about six different lenses and my camera.  I like the other pockets where I can put my flash, extra cards, and batteries.  The &#34;amazon&#34; logos on it are sort of cheesy (there are too many of them) but overall is a great bag.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|After a slow and somewhat rocky start, this movie proceeds to develop the complex character of \\"Whip\\" Whitaker, an excellent pilot, a man calm under pressure, and an alcoholic. Probably the most compelling moment is when Whitaker decides to change his life. A good resurrection movie for Easter Sunday.
1451695195|5.0|I read this book in just a couple of days.  In my own search for meaning and afterlife, found this book intriguing and useful.  I particularly enjoyed the anecdotal experiences of his life and limited beliefs and how he was able to contemplate outside forces which couldn't be explained by the medical community.  Worth a read.
B00AECDDYY|4.0|There are a few levels on this game that will take a while requiring good stratagy. To make it better I think would be to add more treasure to accumulate. Maybe also introduce a &#34;Pirates! Showdown II&#34; as I have completed all the levels.
0307352153|4.0|What Is Quiet?<br /><br />How did we go from Character to Personality without realizing we had sacrificed something meaningful along the way?<br />- Susan Cain<br /><br />Quiet was Susan Cain's exploration into the world of introverts, of which she claims to be, and how the world undervalues their worth. The idea of the Extrovert Ideal is challenged and put to the test.<br /><br />During her quest, Susan interviews introverts and extroverts, discovering what makes them the way they are. Is it genetic? Cultural? Maybe it's environmental? She delves into these areas and so much more.<br /><br />You'll also discover whether being an introvert excludes you from having friends, being a successful salesman, or a vibrant public speaker.<br /><br />All of this is done in four parts. You'll go from the Extrovert Ideal to Your Biology, Your Self? to Do All Cultures Have An Extrovert Ideal? to How To Love, How To Work.<br /><br />Read my full review at [...]<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received a copy of the book from the publisher for my honest review of the book. The opinions shared are my own and not of the publisher.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Average book.  I wish I hadn't read it. I will spend more time selecting the next book.. I wasted my money.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like this game for kids because it is fast, fun and cute and not violent in any way. I would say 4+.
B004J4XGN6|5.0|His thinking is insightful, actionable, and inherently embracing its own improvement.  Interested to follow up on other books he recommends.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I think that. Hungry Shark Evolution was copied off of multiple times... that, or it os copying the hungry shark series. Either way, it's a great game. Totally worth your space. Warning though, it takes a long time to install. Otherwise, it's flawless. No lag on mykindle fire whatsoever.
B007Y36K46|5.0|It's been decades since I read the books, so I wasn't interested in how accurately they were portrayed.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this movie is visually stunning, and grabs your attention immediately.<br /><br />We saw it in the theaters, and purchased it on DVD as soon as it became available.<br /><br />Just watched it again this afternoon with the grandchildren, and they loved it.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|Great movie.  Singing wasn't as good as Broadway but the storyline in more complete and more easily understandable.  Tops my favorite list.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|You'll have to download 100MB extra.<br />You can, but don't have to pay real money, depending on your patience.<br />You start with a baby Triceratops, then expand.<br />It's a lot of fun but sadly, it cannot be played offline.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I found this book to be inspiring and believable.  It was an interesting prospective from a medical professional written in an easy-to-understand manner.<br />The story renewed my beliefs in the hereafter and left me with a good feeling when I finished it.
B008220C38|3.0|The film imitates a stage play in its presentation. I had to watch it twice to understand what the director intended. Even then it was a little too esoteric for me. I was expecting something along the lines of Dr. Zhivago. Keira Knightley didn't feel convincing in the role of Anna. Jude Law as her 'saintly husband' was too bland and his saintliness hard to believe. Her lover's character was irritating. I should have watched the trailers.
B00992CF6W|4.0|All in all I thought this was worth what I payed for. I had fun creating all my heart desired. Although this may not be the complete game, it is still a game the whole family could enjoy. As a bonus multiple devices may allow you to join together to create.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|My opinion for this game is.That it is for all ages. Its fun its like a carnival game.Thair are so menu prizes. plus lots of really cool coins.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:) :/)
B0063IH60K|1.0|I DO NOT HAVE THIS PRODUCT...I BELIEVE IT IS INTERACTIVE AND REQUIRES WI-FI ACCESS.  I MAY HAVE TRIED TO DOWNLOAD THINKING IT WOULD WORK INDEPENDENT OF WIFI...
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Love the movie.  This set has all viewing options, except VHS.  It even has a 3D version, if you have that available.
B004VQFQ2Q|1.0|I purchased the Import CD and the AUTORIPOFF was the US version.. I have been AUTORIPPEDOFF... Now I will wait to see if I get the Import Deluxe CD in the mail.  [[ASIN:B004VQFQ2Q Born Again]]
B00008S7KC|1.0|Bought this dvd for a good friend of mine, I have the same dvd and have had it for several years. He stated that it would not play in his dvd player. He also stated it looked like a bootleg copy. Do not by this dvd.<br /><br />UPDATE: So maybe this isn't a bootleg copy after all. In fine print on the add it states that this dvd is a \\"Region 2\\" dvd. It will only play in dvd players with the region 2 codec. So, if your dvd player did not come from Africa or Egypt or anywhere else in that area, the dvd will not play for you. You need a \\"Region 1\\" dvd (USA, Canada, Mexico). My friend returned the dvd and I have the correct copy being shipped to him. Apologies to the seller for the bad review, but seriously, you should have made the Region 2 information more visible.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I got this on the amazon faotd and it's probably not only the best game available on faotd but also one of the best games for my phone period.<br /><br />Music is surprisingly enjoyable and the game play is a lot of fun. Story line and cut scenes are pretty bad but game play is fun.<br /><br />I did get this for free, but I'd probably pay the $3 for the game if I knew it was this fun.
B000SJJCX4|4.0|My only complaint is that it takes a moment of two to register my E string.  I'm using it for my bass.  I haven't looked to see if there is an instrument selector.  That may clear up my problem.
B009B4ZEKM|2.0|I have been a Xtina fan since her &#34;Genie in a Bottle&#34; days. I was a teen when she first came out so I kinda feel like I've &#34;grown up&#34; with her music. First off, her voice is absolutely amazing. Some people may not consider her 'iconic' but her voice is one in a million. Most people that came up around Christina's time don't even compare in vocal range. She had such a big voice for a pop star who didn't get a chance to really show off her skills or her real personality with her first album. But Stripped was a chance for her to show the world what she could do on her own terms and in her own words. Stripped is my absolute favorite album of all time. She sang from the heart and great experience. She took us on a Journey of finding her own voice (in the figurative and literal sense), writing her own songs, and working with the people she wanted to work with. Teaming up with Scott Storch was one of the best things she's ever done career wise. I don't know what happened between them, but she hasn't been the same Xtina I fell in love with on Stripped. Though Back to Basics was successful and I did enjoy her double disced work; it didn't quite catch the essence of Stripped's Christina. Bionic was a huge fail, even though she had a couple of great songs on it that got overshadowed by truly horrible pop songs. Lotus was an even bigger fail that made me wonder if Christina's reign was up after Stripped. There may be a couple of songs I could tolerate on this album which is why I gave it 2 stars but they are nowhere near memorable. IT really sucks because Xtina is a truly talented individual. But either she needs to retire from music or get it together.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|Great songs and nothing loud and crazy.  Nice soothing music when you are lying on the beach or sitting at the pool.  I also play this CD in my office (on low) but great to listen to and get some work done.
B009P5S11G|3.0|Rihanna is one of very few artists who can release back to back albums successfully. Maybe this is mostly due to the fact that she's a Pop act who tries to stay more current than artistic. She knows the best people to contribute to her album and she oozes sex appeal not only to men but to women. This works for her. She's Mariah Carey or Celine Dion. Nor is she a Beyonce who can entertain even the most reluctant fan. She stays in her lane and this works for her. I own 6/7 of Rihanna's albums and I'd say I can listen to about half of them without skipping a single song. Unapologetic is probably the album that I skip the most songs (besides A Girl Like Me) is this is mostly due to the fact that I have absolutely no clue what's she talking about on some of the songs like &#34;Numb&#34; or even the smash like &#34;Diamonds&#34;. But the songs I do like, I really like. &#34;Pour it Up&#34; is one of those songs that even though you hate it, you somehow still manage to know every word to it. &#34;Phresh Out the Runway&#34; is one of my 3 favorite songs on the album because I love it when a female singer sounds 'gangsta' and she does. &#34;Stay&#34; and &#34;Love without Tragedy&#34; are lyrically the best songs on the album. Even if she didn't write them; they fit her because she can speak from experience. That is one of the best things I love about Rihanna. Even if she had absolutely no lyrical or production input on some of her songs; they still fit her. They were made for her and her voice meshes well with the melody of it all. I think this is what makes Rihanna such a successful artist.<br />My overall issue with this album is simply that I do not like about half the songs on this album. People raved about &#34;Jump&#34;, her version of Ginuwine's &#34;Pony&#34; and I absolutely hate the song and know not one word of it. The million remixes of &#34;Diamonds&#34; were completely unecessary and I can't imagine anyone wanting to listen to them unless they're a DJ that plays the songs in the club. &#34;No Love Allowed&#34; reminds me a lot of &#34;Man Down&#34; from Loud, mostly because of it's island tempo that crazy appealing. &#34;Half of Me&#34; lyrically is good, but the delivery is mediocre. All in all, Unapologetic is a solid album that I'm sure people will still listen to out of admiration of Rihanna the artist, but compared to her other albums, it falls very short on the scale of Excellent to Poor.

1475143389|5.0|I use to be an avid runner. I became 'addicted' to running and even completed a 50 mile ultra-marathon trail race. One reason for my continued need to run more is I was trying to get rid of body fat. I know what was missing from my routine was weight lifting. I have come down off my 'craziness' and am really trying to balance my cardio with weights. I like the simple weight training plans offered and 'supplement' recommendations. I also try to eat a clean life and always wonder if I would benefit from certain supplements. I resist the urge to fall for sales traps. I feel the simple formula for my balance of carbs/proteins/fats will help me lose the fat I need to lose. I also have a problem with wanting to work out for hours (remember the ultra-runs) but it really is not needed to achieve a nice body. One thing mentioned by Matthews is to split cardio-weight training-I struggle with this. I feel like I am giving it my all if I work out for two hours but I am trying to do cardio in the morning and weights at night. I am having success. I have maintained a 2 pound per week weight loss. Easy to read. Finished book in one sitting.

B008MM9630|4.0|its cute worth the price! would recommend for 6+ and adults too! its kind of like family farm! 4 stars!
1594481717|5.0|This book had such an interesting premise (that right-brainers and creative types are going to be in high demand in the future and eventually make the big bucks) that I just had to pick it up. The book did not disappoint. With each chapter, Daniel Pink supports his thesis with well-researched material and interesting anecdotes. I was so blown away by this book that I ended up buying it for all my friends as gifts.
0062231375|2.0|Honestly, don't waste your time unless you want to learn more about the deviant sexual behaviors and endless drug and alcohol inspired rantings of the author and every kitchen crew he has ever worked with. This book will inspire you not to eat out at restaurants, especially supposed swanky ones in NYC. It paints a really one-sided picture that all kitchen crews are degenerate in every way but they are great cooks.

B007I1Q4W2|4.0|This movie really succeeds in taking you to a different place and time, much like the movie Stake Land. The story is strongest when it sticks with the lead actor and his travels through a waste land of zombies and ruined farms. It's at its weakest in trying to weave in the subplot of a crazy Confederate general who is looking for someone who is immune to zombie bites. Its kind of ill defined and you're never really sure what he expects to do with the discovery other than to \\"restore order.\\"
1451695195|4.0|The story of Eben's illness and the details of his family,friends and pastor keeping him in their<br />loving embrace and prayers was very engaging.  Eben says that what many NDE survivors<br />say is that it is very hard to put into words what happened to them.  Many parts of this book<br />were a bit above me in just one go round of reading.  However,I truly felt what he was trying to<br />describe rather than understanding his vocabulary in his deep analysis of the entire experience.<br />This account of an NDE was by far a thousand times more credible than the book by the child who in part had been<br />so obviously fed the literal,bible as divine dictation story and the other part influenced like most little boys by<br />tales of super heroes.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love it! Works perfectly on nexus 7. Blah Blah blah. Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. Blah.
B0074VA2T2|3.0|I was disappointed that the game is so simplistic. I got the app for free so it is OK but I wouldn't pay for it. It keeps my 3 year old busy for about 15 minutes then he gets bored with it.
0316228532|2.0|I bought the book thinking it would be an interesting read, boy was I wrong. This is a 500 page book and it didn't leave with the \\"I can't put this book down till I know what happens\\" feeling until roughly 400 pages into the book. The first part of the book is terribly hard to understand what's going on because you get introduced to a multitude of characters and short stories that don't seem to come together until a lot later in the book. The majority of the book is based around one main theme and when it comes to the conclusion of that theme in the book it is very anti-climatic and basically ends the book on a whole bunch of other stuff that isn't even a part of the main theme of the book. I was very disappointed in this book but I had to read the whole thing because I wanted to give it a chance. Ironic as it sounds if there were a sequel to this book I would buy and read it because I feel like the ending of this book kind of leads you hanging on a whole bunch of subjects.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|I had no idea what to expect when I agreed to see this film.  It was a wonderful surprise!  If you just let yourself go, you can be easily swept up into this place, with these incredible actors.  I was blown away by Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman.  We bought the music and listen to it often and just picked up the blu ray.  5 big stars.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follet is a master storyteller!  I didn't think I could enjoy the second part of this trilogy nearly as much as I enjoyed the first...but I did!  The characters are carefully woven together over decades.  You will easily be drawn in to their worlds.  I can't wait for the final book.  This series could easily be turned into a great film!!  Awesome.
B004R2DS9C|4.0|Got that as a birthday gift for a little boy.  Didn't expect the box to be that small when opened and put together.  However it was cute and practical to use for playing and organizing.  The price was a bit higher than expected.

B00001U0E1|5.0|One of the reasons to love Shakespeare is a love for wordplay. Tom Stoppard is one of the best practitioners of wordplay in contemporary theater. Bringing both together in a comedic movie was a great idea.<br />The conceits that underlies Shakespeare in Love, is that Victorian England is much like today though perhaps with more mud, and that Shakespeare as a not yet recognized genius is poor, insecure, and dependent on the love of a woman for inspiration. Okay the writer specifies horny as another of young Shakespeare's defining characteristics.<br /><br />The plot builds around Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) seeking the romantic inspiration that will allow him to convert Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter into what will become Romeo and Juliet. Inspiration comes in the form of the poetry and theater loving innocent Gwenyth Paltrow (Viola). Her desires, in no particular order, are to love Shakespeare's poetry, act in one of his plays and avoid the titled husband (Lord Wessex played by Colin Firth) who has been bought for her by her father.<br /><br />This movie is built upon some of the best lines from Shakespeare, a variety of comic asides, word games and cross references. Lifting it above merely brilliant use of language is the fact that the supporting cast is superior. Cast members from the young Joe Roberts (the rat catching boy will become the playwright John Webster) to Dame Judy Dench, who will win an Academy award for her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth take turns commanding their respective scenes rather than merely supporting.<br />Shakespeare in Love is one of my all-time favorites. In fairness to those with young children and their own sensitivities there is perhaps a little more of Ms. Paltrow exposed than some viewers might approve. Other than this barest of cautions, this is an entertaining movie built on language, stage action, romance, comedy, and a bit with the dog.
B000VMBXNA|5.0|I loved this book when I first read it.  When my copy vanished during a move, I bought it for my Kindle, so I always could locate it when I wanted to re-read it.  I want to read the Queen's memoirs.

B00B5A9FLY|5.0|This is a great show and the last season. I have all four of the others and watch them quite often. They are funny and very entertaining. I wish the show would go on for several more seasons but like all good things it must come to an end. This is a great season with a lot of fighting and really good special effects. If you are a true Merlin fan you must have it to complete your collection! Colin and Bradley are great actors and work well together.

B00003CXB6|1.0|I had just listened to the unabridged book of The Lost World and wanted to have another look at the movie.  Very disappointed.  If the movie had followed the storyline of the book, it would have been much more enjoyable.  As it is now, quite a farce.  i gave the movie away to someone that wanted it after I viewed it once.  I am amazed I found someone that wanted it.

1449410243|1.0|I have to say I was looking forward to reading this book.  My kids were begging me to get it.  It was a good thing I got to read it first.<br /><br />There were only 4 pages out of the entire book that really had anything to do with the title. Those 4 pages were hilarious!  I mean just absolutely hilarious!  The rest of the book, not so much.<br /><br />There was also a great deal of unnecessary cussing.  Now look, it wouldnt have been the same if Rhett had told Scarlett he didnt give a darn.  But it was as if the writter (or editor) had literally said, \\"We need a cuss word on this page.\\" Then close their eyes put wrote a cuss word where ever the pencil landed.  It didnt add to what they were writing to & actually took away from it because it just didnt make sense.  Plus, what he wrote just wasnt that funny. And I am not sure if the author is homophobic, not out of the closet yet, or just obsessed with gay sex: really trying to understand why he felt the need to harp on it so much.<br /><br />The book could have been so much more if the author had just continued with the theme he put forth in the title.  But with only 4 pages out of 150, it just even isnt worth the time to read it......Ok the digging in the litter box to practice hiding bodies was funny.

B004P1JEXE|5.0|Book 4 of the series and you will find it difficult to know who is who if you have not read the preceding books. Some of the language and such would, in my mind, put it in the older teenager and adults reader range. Engrossing read as the lives, loves, lies and treachery take place in this game of thrones. You will find that you want to find out what happens to your favourite characters, as strange twists and turns take place in their lives. One of those books that are hard to put down.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Typical Bond movies have more action scenes, but this one less. Skyfall (IMO, great choice of title) was more tension filled drama, cat and mouse type plot. Great opening 15 minutes had me hooked into the movie. Nice song for movie title intro, sung by famous artist. Awesome finding out why the movie was named Skyfall. I look forward to seeing it again, but only if it's for free.<br /><br />Only minor bad thing about streaming movies through Amazon is that there are no subtitles available.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I have really enjoyed this game, it's Just hours and hours of shark devastation. Good game, I hope they can come out  with some updates as well. I recommend that everyone get this fantastic game. Have fun.
B0091REZMW|4.0|its very fun and addictive you only have to buy diamonds if your not patience enough to waif for your energy to build back up.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Really enjoyable reading, plenty of twists, excitement,Romance and every day living.I have enjoyed all of Nicholas Sparks.books so far.<br /><br />Ajaninemaynard@tampabay.rr
B0070Y46UY|4.0|This book was highly recommended to me by others...and I recommend it, as well.  It is very well written and interesting.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|This movie told a great story regarding a social problem.  It was well done and I have always loved Denzel Washington,
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Pretty good free app.Other than that its the best hungry shark of all and u keep upgrading to bigger and better sharks.But if u want to be the best , u can buy more coins from the app store.I don't recommend it for being a free app.
B009AMANH4|5.0|Lincoln told a great story regarding one of our historical heroes.  I don't believe the political side has ever been told before.
B005WUHAX8|2.0|I like the appearance of the case on the phone. However, I am very displeased for the amount of money the case cost, that it won't allow me to put the phone on vibrate with the button on the left side of the phone. I'm not sure if this is true of the cases, or if I got a defective one.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|This is a great game, but it crashes often and cost way to much money. Also you can't get pat one level without hearts. You can invite friends to get hearts but if they don't accept you don't move on. So sad my granddaughter was so excited and now so sad. Shame on you gameloft
0609610570|5.0|Arrive very fast. Very good. I haven't finish yet. But I heard that it is a good book to read.
B000002H6C|5.0|I used to have the tape, and wanted the CD. This was always one of my favorite Metallica CD's before they became a more mainstream sounding band, This music will get you pumped!
B0002TJGQS|5.0|Great price got here fast long lasting and work great and when I need more I will be buying again
B005HS00NW|3.0|After listening to the snipets and seeing that the reviews were overall positive I decided to try it out. The music is totally different there is a lot of that random noise and crap throughout both CD's but the actual songs were okay. It would have been better if it was reduced to 1 CD, I don't really like disk 2. If I was in the right mood (drooling and incoherent) I think the CD would sound better. If I heard this whole CD before buying it I wouldn't have bought it.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Awesome movie great story. Recommend you check it out. Beautiful scenes and and a good ending. Worth watching by the family
B00BSBY38A|4.0|This movie had some cool ideas and the way it was produced was definitely entertaining. It's a good story and the special effects were amazing. It's not a typical type of movie I watch but I enjoyed it.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|I am a sucker for a good love story and as always Nicholas Sparks delivers.  It has a little mystery to it as well.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|This movie started out great but slowly turns into one of those cheesy love stories. Ted was great, hilarious, after that ehhh.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved it!  The momentum continued right from the first book.Cannot wait to start the final one! A great , thrilling read!
B001EX5CMS|4.0|I first saw this concert on one of the music channels provided with my cable package. I enjoyed it so much that I bought the DVD for my collection. I've watched it several times with different people, all of which have equally enjoyed it. There's something on here for everyone, from oldies to current rock standards. One of my favorite parts is where Paul Rodgers plays tunes with his kids Steve and Jasmine. There are too many big names in this concert to name here. Check it out. You won't be sorry you bought it.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|One of the best TV series ever on FX . Keep up the good work such as Justified  and the Americans.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Supper addicting and fun! I just wish it was a little easier to level up. Also, getting the diamonds without paying is difficult as well. Despite those two issues though, this is my favorite game on my Kindle!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I downloaded this on the advice of a friend.  My kids like it too.  Great for waiting, especially when wifi is not available.
B0063IH60K|4.0|great way to pass the time........User friendly app. was easy to download. like the set-up. recommend using this application. thank you.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|So far I am enjoying this game. No problem loading and graphics are good on my Kindle Fire. I have enjoyed all the games I have purchased from G5. Excellent value for the price.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|very fun for passing time but how about you guys make it easier to afford upgrades instead of trying to rob people thanks
B009EAO38C|5.0|While we can't contribute all the melodies to these guys, they take them and make them better.<br /><br />While You Tube videos definitely capture an extra element that just the music does not, I still can't get these great themes and arrangements out of my head after listening and I don't mind.  They are very enjoyable to listen to and keep thing up beat.<br /><br />Thanks Piano Guys!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|The one stars that say you have to buy everything, true, but can be justified, this is a strategy game, very in depth and addicting, I've already have everything, WITHOUT paying any more than $0.99. Everything has a price with or without money. Twist your brain see how smart you can get with this! If you need help, go on the internet, there are sites and video walkthroughs.<br /><br />The point of this is to be a nano-organisim and wipe out all humantity, you people this is only a game, you can win and pretty easy too(if you know what to do)! Each time you win in normal, you unlock the next plague type, of you beat all of them on brutal, you unlock something special, and it's not always easy! While you play the game it's &quot;currency&quot; are DNA points, what you buy are transmissions, symptoms, and abilities. Sometimes funny news comes up and other tips come up on too. The game though, is noob-friendly, even with it's complex style and daunting difficulty to win sometimes, it is noob-friendly.<br /><br />I hope you all have fun, now, what I have to say, a tip. Invest in transmissions first, then when you infect everyone do the symptoms, keeps you from being discovered by the scientists.
B007PKOKTK|2.0|Kids enjoyed it, but I'd rather have them watch something I can enjoy as well.<br /><br />Acting was horrible and music was okay (would be better if I liked the rock genres more, I suppose).<br /><br />No morales taught per say and even the funniest moments were more haha funny than really laugh out loud.<br /><br />Will pass on paying more than $.99 on this type of show next time.
0307352145|4.0|In Quiet, Cain educates the reader Western society’s historical drift to value the extrovert temperament.  She indicates that with industrialization society has embraced extroverts and their outgoing nature as a signature of success and happiness.  Cain does an excellent job to review and refute this and other misconceptions of introverts while providing prospects for embracing and empowering them in our personal and professional lives.  The book covers a broad scope of subjects from nature vs. nurture, group think, to potential implications in cross-cultural negotiations.  The content is lightly peppered with empirical data supporting benefits and risks of introversion.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Love the storyline and the game is very fun and addictive!! Cant wait for the next one.. ^^ Totally recommend this game for those who love adventure and meticulous..
B009KNPNT6|5.0|A great edition of an even better CD. Some really great tracks including some really great live recordings that makes this CD a must have.
0307277887|5.0|I am an avid watcher of Dexter the show but I'm very much into knowing my roots when it comes to music/movies/tv shows, etc. So i bought the book to compare and see where the material for the show came from. I am still reading it but I am loving it so far! It is very close to the first season, even a lot of the dialogue is the same.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|Denzel Washington....That's all that needs to be said, he is a superb actor in an equally superb movie. A must for anyone's collection.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This is one of the most fun games I have played. However it stopped working after I bought the full version. I cannot find where to contact anyone. I have deleted the profile and am starting over hoping it will work now.
B005LAIHEA|5.0|A very funny and well written film by Jason Segal and his partner. Really shows the extent of the muti talented Segal's career.
B00A757EFW|5.0|This game is the best!OMG THE SAME AS way back then.when the regular version(in the arcade).I recommend YOU<br />SHOULD buy it.they are going to put this on most helpful reviews.
B005LAII8K|5.0|Surprisingly great sci-fi movie Joseph Gordon-Levitt was terrific in this film that he had been waiting to make for over 10 years.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Would recommend this game to anyone into horses. Great way to kill some time. I have even been playing when not bored very addictive.
0783219733|5.0|This is a very cute movie that I can watch with children, and not worry about the violence or language that is way too prevalent in many movies today.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I couldn't help but cry in the end, and also after \\"his\\" Death. I loved this book, but I feel exactly like Hazel did after she read her book, I want some answers! Does Hazel die?
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite movies.  Even though it is an old movie, it tells the true story of a real American hero.  My son watched it with me when he was young, and lately I've heard him quote bits of it.  A good movie to show young ones how war was fought in World War I.  Even though there is a lot of gun-fire during the few war scenes, there is no blood, or gory things to see.
B0067R0APK|3.0|Wanted to give this app 5 stars but can't since the maps won't load on my Samsung Note II.  Fix that bug and I will re-rate.
B00992CF6W|5.0|ya i love this game blocks blocks blocks blocks blocks blocks it is all made of blocks. u should get this app
B006362ZR6|5.0|Love this cd~~every song on it is good. I have really enjoyed listening to it. Would highly recommend it to anyone who is familiar with and likes The Fray.
B009C7JS14|4.0|I like it but it's not as good as weather.com, so I haven't used it much.  Thanks anyway, hope this helps.
B00BF11STU|4.0|Excellent job on this American tragedy turned to triumph.  Clearly there was some fiction in the interest of dramatic appeal, but this did not take away from the authenticity.  Highly recommended.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It was really intense and suspenseful.  I thought the acting was outstanding. I recommend it.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I luv this game one time I spent 6 hours on it! so i luv it<br />like so tucking much
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Excellent story sparks at his best, again!!it's been awhile since I've read a book that made me cry but at the end of this book I not only cried but was actually sobbing I highly recommend this book really brings out emotions that you forgot about.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game ever. Its worth your time. You. get to collect lots of coins and stuff like that. AWESOME! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This is the funniest game ever you can dye there hair cut it in layers and even shave there heads there are 6 characters to choose from and they all have a fun child like personality it's worth all the money you'll love it(:
159448385X|5.0|This book is one of the best I have read in a long time.  I thought \\"The Kite Runner\\" was the best but this one is even more better.  Actually, I loved them both.  When I finished reading \\"The Kite Runner\\", all I wanted to do is go to Afghanistan and bring back all the people suffering there.  Now, after reading \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\", the feeling is even stronger!  I can't wait till his next novel!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I enjoy playing this when I am bored and it also keeps the little ones busy too. great game. just wish it was easier to earn energy to compete
B00A757EFW|3.0|i love pac man.  the maneuvering around of the controls is difficult but with practice I'm sure i can master it.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love my Jillian Michaels DVDs.  She is a great trainer and good motivator as an alternative to a gym.  I find the workouts challenging, easy to follow, and have seen results when done consecutively.  You can customize your workout too which is cool.  She give clear and concise directions on all the movements and she talks you through it nicely.  I am always happy to work out with Jillian!
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|If you love the new ABC show Nashville like my family does, then you'll adore the music that it's also created! This is only disc 1 as they've recently announce they will be releasing a disc 2...can't wait!
1616550414|5.0|Love the book.  Quality made product with alot of informative info.  Plus there's the timeline!! Hell, i had to skip over stuff in the book because I haven't finished skyward sword yet.
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|I own every book written by Nicholas Sparks...and any film adaptation of his book is also an must see! It is, as expected from this author, a great romance story.
B008KMHFJY|5.0|This is the second time I read this book.<br />You can't help falling for these two. They are so much alike and different.<br />Abby is running from her past and Travis just happens to be right there center stage for her to meet.<br />They have so many struggles between them. They even make it difficult for each other to get along. Everybody around them know they belong together but they are both stubborn in their own way that it takes them through break ups, fights, attacks<br />and a fire before they reallize it. I can't wait for Walking Disaster<br />to be released so I can find out what they have been up and what bets will be happening between them.
B004EPZ070|4.0|I watch this one a few times a year since adding it to my library. It is a solid, watch when bored flick and has a twist that is not exactly expected in it.
B007E73MSY|5.0|An album that doesn't disappoint, great from start to finish. The band continues to evolve and they get better with each and every album.
B0000VAFNQ|5.0|I have the whole set so that says it all there. Worth adding to your library if you like this type of movie and especially if you are into the series.
B003SAF76Q|5.0|An album that doesn't disappoint, great from start to finish. The band continues to evolve and they get better with each and every album.
B002ZG9968|4.0|THis movie is a little different as it reflects changes in our Social structure and is therefore more suited to modern day circumstances, though it seems unlikely this would really happen, you never know. Cute movie though some of it is a little more then I wanted to see in the birthing segments.
B007F5SG22|5.0|I gained an understanding of the problems and difficulties faced by Muslim women. I also acquired some knowledge fconfronting political refugees and the dislocations they suffer
B00164KYV4|4.0|This really covers the angles of the confusing mix between men and women in the dating scene today. Good all around semi serious dating flick.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Seeing the series without constant interruptions by advertising, allows the viewer to concentrate upon both the story development and the characters
B004ZGI1V0|5.0|I like Liam Neeson so just about anything he does I like. But this is  a good saturday laze the day away flick and I have added it to my library.
B0089LOKHG|4.0|Great book. Loved the story. My daughter and I have both read the series. Definitely recommend the series to all ages.
0767836324|5.0|You can't get much better then this film for family entertainment. It is still a favorite of my children as well as my grandchildren and myself. My package arrived on time and in the stated condition. I would buy from this seller again.
B004EWEX9Y|5.0|Everything was packed well and shipped quickly. The video quality is really good when downloading them from my itouch to my tv.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|One simply cannot miss the conclusion of this series. My package arrived on time and in the stated condition. I would buy from this seller again. The movie is pretty decent as well :)
B0090SI3ZW|5.0|This is 2 thumbs up and I can Not wait for part two. The cast on this one was beyond great
B002K0WBXW|5.0|I like Sandra Bullock, as well as Ryan Reynolds so this was a no brainer to buy. However the flick is quite entertaining and funny as well. I recommend it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Period drama that is very addictive. As a guy, I am not fan of shows like this, but for some reason I can't get enough of it and can see why many folks like myself are getting hooked on it.<br /><br />Episodes per season are just like what you would see from a BBC series, nothing like the 20-22 episodes you get in a typical US series.<br /><br />Warning: If you binge watch these seasons like I did then you will hate the ending of Season 3, it will make you clamour for the next one. My advice space it out until Season 4 starts and watch the new season on PBS. (or PBS.org for Free)
B00177Y9ZC|4.0|The Extra Sensory angle in this film makes it unique however it's entertaiment value shouldn't be missed. Something different with a good screenwritter is always good:)
B002OFWG7E|4.0|Another addition to your music collection that you must have.  Covers most singles that were released with the exception of the last couple albums.  I would recommend this album to anyone who listened to this genre of music from the 90s.
B008AX18Y6|5.0|Rushdie's sense of humor is delightful. His absorption with his own condition was to be expected in a work that is autobiographical, but was somewhat disappointing considering the momentous and tragic happenings in his own country of birth that claimed the lives of thousands of innocent people. I hope he will write some day about the ruthless and amoral pursuit of power in India.
B0000C1733|5.0|Album contains the majority of the band's singles but lacks the singles released from the last couple of albums such as Aeroplane and Danny California.  This only due to when it was released.  I would recommend this album to anyone who listened to this genre of music from the 90's through the early 2000's.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I started this book just after ending the first one and I found myself once again in the world of Christian and Ana.  I loved this book more than the last and I found that even the draggy parts of the last book were gone and I was unable to put it down.  The characters were strong and the obvious hurdles they have to overcome almost seemed impossible.  I do like that this book was written appropriately in first person and liked that I was able to always know what Ana was thinking and was able to see things through her eyes.  Also, it allowed us to see Christian the way she would. I would definately recommend this book.  It kept me interested throughout.  I love Fifty Shades Darker.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Had trouble clicking on scrat at first, expanding is too expensive, the friend page glitches a lot but still fun.
B0010EM0O4|5.0|Not disappointed, and pleased at the price.  Will be a bit more gentle with the ball and socket joint.  Repeated disassembly and re-assembly will break the tabs in the socket.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|I'm still crying. This may be a short book but it us unbelievably moving and heart wrenching. Wow, a must read for sure.
B008EZVNFE|5.0|Liane la havas has a great voice and big personnality  ,so i really enjoy this record too !!!she can be proud of her production!!!<br />love this one too!!
1416914285|5.0|I couldn't stop reading this book. From the action scenarios to the witty remarks between the characters, my imagination definitely went wild. I've always been a sucker for the bad boy characters who have their sweet side and willlingness to protect the girl no matter what. I can't wait to continue to book two.
B009NYF2GQ|5.0|Just a classic movie that my wife loves. This is really really stupid to require a minimum number of words for a review!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This app is kind of like Temple run; but I think this app is better. I give it a four out of five.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I'm giving Fifty Shades Darker three stars because the book is not well written. On the other hand, it held my interest all the way through.<br />I'd recommend it to someone for a light, quick read.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|... the best upgrades cost either glu credits or real money, and the free glu credits thing isn't worth anything. Other than that it's an awesome Game.
B008WOULPK|4.0|Even though she must have had plenty of help writing this book, Grace Coddington did an excellent job packing in<br />her many adventures, a lifetime of notable friends, all seemingly listed in this book.  For someone interested in the world of fashion it is<br />a book to savor. My guess is that Grace: A Memoir, especially appeals to single women.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|this program is fun to keep testing yourself against your last best time. Thanks for such a fun and addicting game.
B00466HN72|1.0|Product was advertised as including a digital copy and ultraviolet. The code that was included in the package for the digital versions expired 7 months ago. Very disappointing as I specifically selected this version of the movie because of the digital copy.
B0063M22QO|2.0|you are locked in to repeat unsolveable puzzles with no option to go to next step, i have played other programs that are more reward of completion, and clearly marked to go farther.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is very addicting and FUN.  Thinking  ha  never been so FUN and challenging. Keeping the mind active is healthy and this game makes you think.
B000FA5TTW|5.0|I love the way to author changes point of view so casually.... Love it!!!!! The ending isn't the way u expected but still awesome
B0063IH60K|3.0|This classical game just fills time. Sometimes it  is hard to win but just reshuffle and play again. Just ok game
B009AMANBA|1.0|So were you hoping and hopping for a good movie. #1 The quality stinks. Half way through the movie you get to watch a replay of something you just watched. Poor quality.<br /><br />Mr. and Mrs. Prez just seemed to have an argument every five minutes.....<br /><br />Fore play?????? Or just getting to know one another. First date!!!! HUH!!!!<br /><br />Both are wonderful actors but they couldn't ride along in the carriage with the story..... MOI
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|gift for my niece, she loves the series and now loves the movie, will def.<br />shop for her on line again
B00AUU2KI0|4.0|\\"Life of Pi\\" has been sitting on my bookshelf for years, unread, but with the release of the film version of the story, I wanted to make sure I had the book under my belt before seeing the movie.  So to that end, \\"Life of Pi\\" is no longer unread.<br /><br />Because of the widespread acclaim for both the novel and the film, most people are already familiar with the plot.  For those who aren't, however, the bare bones are as follows: Pi Patel, a young Indian boy and the son of a zookeeper, has a fervent love of stories and practices not only his native Hinduism, but also Christianity and Islam. When Pi is sixteen, his family and their zoo animals emigrate from India to North America aboard a Japanese cargo ship. The ship sinks, however, and Pi finds himself in a lifeboat, his only companions a hyena, an orangutan, a wounded zebra, and a 450-pound Bengal tiger. Soon the tiger has dispatched all but Pi. Pi must use his fear, knowledge, and cunning to keep himelf alive until they find land.<br /><br />There is a heavy dose of spirituality in the story, with the first portion of the book devoted to Pi's pan-religiosity and love of God and gods.  There are a few instances when this can seem preachy, but it never crosses over into proselytizing, and can be forgiven for the sake of character development.  This part of the book can potentially be off-putting for readers expecting to find themselve immediately adrift with a Bengal tiger, but it serves the story well, and makes Pi's incredible journey more credible.<br /><br />Once at sea, the story - as one might expect - becomes considerably more gripping, as Pi faces starvation, dehydration, despair and a set of circumstances on his lifeboat for which there is clearly little precedent.  His journey with the tiger is engaging, entertaining, and somewhat amazingly, even believable.<br /><br />All of this sits well within the confines of good fiction, however, until the last portion of the book, when Pi finally makes landfall in Mexico.  It is then that he is interviewed at length by two incredulous representatives of the Japanese shipping company that owned the freighter which sank out from underneath Pi and his family.  It is here that a hidden layer to this story is revealed, which is open to interpretation in a number of fairly significant ways, and it is here that the story separates itself from the merely good to the very good.  (I won't reveal what this layer is in this space, as the reader deserves to discover it on his own.)<br /><br />I was not as blown away by this book as I thought I might be - perhaps the increasing presence of Indian culture in our own has softened the story's exoticism, and likewise, it is probably impossible for \\"Life of Pi\\" to live up to the hype surrounding it.  That said, however, this is a worthy read, and one that, in its closing pages, had me contemplating the tale for some time after turning the final page.  Definitely recommended.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is the best keyboard application around for android I love SwiftKey y'all keep up the good work you guys
B007RRFUHM|4.0|I got this CD because I love Kimbra with Gotye. I would recommend this CD and I really enjoy several of the songs!
B003WUYRGI|5.0|It was good for a kindle it had a lot of word's I could not find in other dictionaries. Good job
0790729350|5.0|I have watched 95% of this DVD and love it.  the Director's Cut is great since it has extra groups and info.  Even thoughI have never done drugs this was an event and was extrmely well done.
B00008G7UJ|5.0|I used to show the visual text of the play to my 9th grade English students.  They loved it and felt<br />Ike they better understood the play.
B002HFP0QU|4.0|Love the Bee Gees and never get tired of listening to them.  They did  a lot of great music over the years and I'm sorry it had to come to an end.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|since I am a fan of ian somerhalder, I had to buy this. I always thought the vampire tv shows were corny. it is 2013 and I finally had the interest and time to watch it. I love the storyline and how everyone is intertwined in some way or another. the fact that ian somerhalder and nina dobrev is a real life couple makes the show even more interesting. and the fact that ian somerhalder is utterly hot, it makes the story even more juicy!<br /><br />I am almost done with watching season 1 and will buy the other seasons. I am just hoping the vampires will not suck the life out of every human being in mystic falls. it is what they like but the fact that humans are still around makes the story even more exciting. at some point, I forget that the story deals with vampires. it is the love and personal issues that takes the viewer away from the whole vampire theme. this is what I like. seriously, if every scene had some vampire sucking blood, it would be so boring.<br /><br />I totally loved the very, very last scene in the 22nd episode of the 4th disc. I found myself rewinding the part where Damon kissed Elena, well for all of those who watched it already know who he was really kissing... but I couldn't care less. the fact that he kissed her just made it so romantic and the 1st physical step to their relationship. the way he pecked on the cheek first and then kissed her to the full extent would make any ian somerhalder fan convulse!
0894803123|5.0|This book is not just a recipe book... It tells their story and it is quite entertaining! Great recipes too.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|This was one of the best DVD and music videos I have purchased. It tells the story of how Adele put on one of the best concerts of all time. The songs were varied and I am enjoying the CD that came with the DVD very much. I would highly recommend this DVD/CD to anyone who loves this artist and her music.
B006X96PF6|4.0|I love Loreena McKennitt, and this album doesn't disappoint.  The quality of her voice and the songs she chooses is great.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Love. Love. I regret not reading this book sooner. Beyond excited for the series :) Love. Love. Seriously, where have I been that it took me so long to read such a vivid and imaginative story.
B00B6QXN56|3.0|After Joe B's Live at the Beacon, I experienced \\"I Woke Up Dreaming\\" easily the best acoustic performance I have ever seen or heard.  I think I set the bar too high hoping everything would sound as good as that on Joe B's new CD.  After only one listen I was a little disappointed, again, maybe expecting too much.  I have all of Joe B's music & I sincerely believe he may be the best guitarist in the world.  I figure after I listen a few more times I will be on board with the other reviewers.  His enthusiasm is next to none - along with his talent.
B00006ADFL|5.0|I got the dvd in create condition, though it had the tag that it was from Hollywood Video. I don't know if it was purchased there or if it was never returned since I have never rented movies there. There's no price tag on it so… yea. Anyway, it's a great film because it's based on a true crime in New Zealand back in the 50s.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I hate this game each time I get off of it, it delete my progress. Do not get this game.
B00000K31Q|5.0|You must have this movie. It arrived in good conditions and one time. It's a good 90s comedy romance movie and I love the the genius plot. A lot of manipulation, though.
B00C4QWDYY|5.0|This show addresses more issues than most zombie movies, some realistic and some dramatic. In any case it has raised the bar for cinematic dystopian fantasy.
0061950726|4.0|This is a story of 2 orphans who drift through the \\"system\\" in different decades.  Vivian was on the Orphan Train to the Midwest during the late 20s and Molly is a 17 year old in the foster care system today.  When they meet they can see themselves in each other and a family is made.<br /><br />I loved the characters and the storyline.  Molly and Vivian are meant to be family in every way. I could not wait for the next chapter and learn what the next development was.  The story flows smoothly from the present to the past with an honest look into the pros and cons of foster care, then and now.  Of course, the hardships of the 20s and 30s have been corrected today, but these are stories that need to be heard to ensure that the past is not repeated.<br /><br />Highly recommend!
B00991TCOG|5.0|Again- disappointed that I'm forced to give a certain number of praise words in order to submit my comments. Not cool!
B0050PYNN0|4.0|If you're looking at this movie, you're probably a Danny mcbride fan already and know what you're getting yourself into. If you don't know who Danny mcbride is, you can expect nothing less than a lot of debauchery, drugs, constant innuendo, and side splitting laughs. Definitely hilarious.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|A most believable history of an important--one might even say apocalyptic--war.  I felt that I had lived through it and was catching up on events in other places.  How I longed to be rescued, only my quick and decisive action saved myself, time and time again.  I recommend this to history buffs ,people who understand writers' craft, and to those who love to be teased.
B00846F1YW|3.0|My first time and I loved it. The wires were challenging. If you love finding many lost items,this is for you. The characters are weird, so let yourself imagine a town like this one,and you can almost find it freaky.
B00AHGSVKS|4.0|Clarke wrote well and held my attention.  The story works, and is as relevant today as it was when he wrote it.  Thanks again,<br />Arthur C. Clarke!
B007PVHMCG|3.0|So, I was fortunate to find this LEGO Minecraft set at retail price months after it became sold out.  Overall, it's not bad, pretty faithful to the source material, but there was one little problem that I'll get to in a moment.  Pros, again, pretty faithful to the source material, and it looks great.  Cons, it is, as many people have pointed out, smaller than you would expect for something that's 400 pieces, and $35 retail and $50 or more on eBay or other sellers on Amazon.  Not really worth the money if you're expecting something large at that piece count.  The biggest con for me was that it was missing a piece!  One of the 2x2x3 squares was not in my set, and that isn't something I've experienced with LEGO, ever.  MEGA BLOKS is good at leaving pieces out, but I was shocked to see a piece missing from this set.  Strangely, they did include an extra Steve face, but not a Steve body piece.  Overall, it's okay, it's a neat piece of memorabilia, but if you're looking for a toy for your kid, move on.  Get a box of regular LEGOs and let his imagination run wild.  You would get the same bang for your buck.
B00466HN6S|4.0|We saw this movie before & I knew the kids wanted it. Once the price went down I bought it & was just in time for Easter. Yay! Cute movie.
0062238868|4.0|I enjoyed this book quite a bit. I was expecting a bit more action and detail surrounding the battles and such (don't get me wrong, there is a lot of shoot 'em up stuff in here). I'd still suggest the book though.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Clancy's writing style is his alone. It pulls you into the story and makes you want to not put it down until the story is over.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|The writing is good and the story is good as well. Very creative idea. But the young author has missed the boat by ruining the ending. The ending he decided on is second rate. He could have--should have, done much better. It is a real let down to be taken along for a good ride, expecting an interesting and exciting climax and then to get this!<br />Very amateur--almost looks like he really did not know how to end it so he just patched something together to get it over with.<br />Could have been 5 star--instead only 3.
B004TI5N38|5.0|I like new characters from a favorite author and Zero Day fits the bill. I don't want to spoil the read but I guarantee it will keep your attention and keep you reading long into the night.

0307887448|5.0|Heard about this book from a podcast and decided to check it out. After I started reading it I found it harder and harder to put down. Great read! I want more!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an interesting game,I started to play this and I thought it was cool.I'm addicted to this.this is the first time I make.  Review so yeah
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I never thought I would buy a series since there are so many reruns available, but this one is my keeper, and I intend to have them all so I can enjoy Castle, Beckett and the rest of the crew whenever I want.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Fun to play and can be very addicting. Fun to try and build your army and defeat the other players
B0053O89KG|5.0|I'm a Castle fan, so what more can I say that other Castle fans wouldn't immediately relate to.  The series is always good for a laugh mixed in with a plot that rarely fails (and then, not really ever fails entirely).  The cast obviously likes one another, and the bonding is evident.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|not much to say here, if you love Lord of the rings than you will love the hobbit.<br />shipped in 24 hours (with prime) everything brand new in plastic.
B003L77FYS|5.0|Well, I am prejudice since I never miss Castle.  If perchance I am unable to watch it at its scheduled time, I record it.  I guess that hasn't been enough because I have purchased all the available seasons thus far.  I love the cast, the stories and everything else about this series, so you can call me prejudiced fan because I am.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's an awesome game but the scoring is much slower that Subway Surfers on an iPhone.Overall, it's a fun game to play when your bored.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|great series, even if it is killing off characters I like!  I find it fun to wait and watch a whole season in a couple sitting rather than the week to week drama.
0310263670|5.0|We received a non-English version, how did this happen?  Were we to designate a langage?  In the middle of the presentation the CD was corrupted.  We had to fast forwad toi get out of the corruption.  Thus we missed part of the movie. WTW
B000002GB4|5.0|This was an album of discovery for Styx. Tommy Shaw just came on board and gave Styx of power guitar player. This album became the launching pad for some of Styx's best albums ever.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i love the game! it is so awesome! but there is a game called &quot;survivalcraft&quot; that is such a rip off and notch should sue them!!!!!
B009KEN87O|5.0|I'm hard to please...but I really enjoy the look and feel of this game.  It's simple yet satisfying game play.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|We streamed the HD version and had no problems. The story revolves around the end of the US Civil War and the approval of the 13th amendment to the US Constitution and much of the politics surrounding those times in Washington. Some people have issues with this package, and I believe that Spielberg created a big, ambitious project doing this. The scope and story are large and to squish it all into less than a few hours requires some compromises. Viewers wanting a perfect outcome will be somewhat disappointed. Those expecting a happy ending need to brush up on US history.<br />The large collection of actors did a stellar job on their characters, I thought.  The dark undertones of the sets kept the War in my mind throughout the story. The raucous nature of the House and its collective, historical characters was expected and delivered!  Was this a condensed dramatization of historical events? Yes!  Was this well acted, well directed, and excellently produced? Yes!  It surely raises the bar for historical theater in my opinion. I would love to see a few more of these created for other major historical events.  Oh well, back to my books.
1616550414|5.0|This book is sweet! It's like text book sized, maybe a foot tall, includes a 32 page bonus comic in the back and all the other stuff is just amazing. It really goes in depth. Couldn't be more worth 25 bucks.
1594487154|5.0|This is a wonderful book.  Daniel Pink has such an engaging writing style and writes about such interesting topics.  I love how he talked about the changes that have re-shaped the way we work and interact.  In effect, these changes make non-sales selling a bigger part of all of our jobs.<br /><br />In addition to being engaging and interesting, this book also includes practical advice.  Advice I know I'll work to incorporate into my business.  Thanks Daniel Pink - I'm SOLD on your book!!<br />Bob Wilson
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Once I began to read the story of Enzo I couldn't stop until I finished!  The author captured the feeling of devotion that only a pet can give a family. The trials faced by the family and the unconditional love of their dog was so well written.  This is an excellent story. One I will never forget.
B00772M1F6|5.0|I grew up with parents that only listened to the \\"oldies\\" radio station, which meant while my peers drove to school listening to Britney and Back Street Boys on the radio, I had Elvis, The Temptations, Big Bopper, and all the other greats of the 1950s-60s rock and Motown scenes to nourish my musical tastes. I was raised on those sounds, and JD McPherson's album Signs & Signifiers is like mother's milk. It's more rock than Motown, but it's got a flow that carries you through every single track. Not since Amy Winehouse's album Back to Black have I been so taken with an artist and an album as a whole. In this age of single track downloads, this is one album that is guaranteed soul shaking, earthquaking, baby making rock throughout. And you can take that to the bank, cousins.
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved every minute of it (and I'm a loyal Fifty Shades fan & follower) WONDERFUL EROTIC & ENTERTAINING. Great love story :)
B004W2UBYW|5.0|a great book about a great entrepreneur well written by Walter Isaacson . It was a delightful reading experience about an exceptional human being.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|See the beauty in just this one moment.  Feel a breeze.  Watch petals float through the air. This is love of the most special kind. In dying there is true living.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|We really enjoy this case.  My wife has it on her Kindle full time.  It's really lightweight and convenient while still providing an acceptable level of protection for the case.  Best &#34;smart cover&#34; clone we've seen for the Kindle so far.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Fun so much fun but the landmarks could be cheaper than they are<br />Also they could give more land than they do
B0062IQNG4|4.0|I bought this one for my wife and she really enjoys it.  She says it's not as good as the soundtrack to the original movie, but it's still worth owning.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Addictive addictive addictive very very very very very very addictive but  need more coins  plus it was free get it and you will see
B009E2U7L2|4.0|My kid loves listening to this as we ride around town.  I'm not huge into pop music, but this has a lot of good rhythms and catchy lyrics.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Great product. Fast delivery. Fair price. I am enjoying this disc very much. I am a life long Hendrix fan and pleased to hear some previously unreleased material. Liner notes are great too.
B00A3OT34M|4.0|I've listened to a fair portion of this album and while a lot of the rhythms and beats are similar from song to song, it's still an enjoyable album.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|A good book is like a new lover; you can hardly put them down. Even in your exhaustion; body stained from each encounter, your mind still thinks of them in subtle ways. Patrick's words will stay with me for quiet sometime. Call me a fool, but I loved this book.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I bought this mouse as a replacement for a Razer Imperator that I have had for about 2-3 years.  The Razer mouse began double clicking instead of single clicking even with adjustments to the click speed.  This was an affordable many button mouse with cool features so I opted to give it a try.  It was definitely worth it.  The only thing I don't love about it are the weights it came with.  They aren't overly heavy so you can't really give the mouse a &#34;heavy&#34; feel.  I use it with everything in there and it's still pretty light weight.  That being said though, this is on of the best mice I've used in a long time.
B005LAII9O|5.0|One of the better movies I have seen in a while. I would recommend buying this movie. I would watch it again.
B007MU85D0|4.0|Folk music is all the rage these days and this one is no exception.  Was an enjoyable album that I caught on sale at Amazon mp3.  Great for the price.
0385344333|5.0|I haven't read the book yet, but if it is like any of the rest of the Jack Reacher books, I am sure I will be as satisfied with this one as I have been with all of the other ones.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|We got this recently and can't stop watching!!  Quality is great!  Would Definitely Recommend!  Can't wait to order next season!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|really awesome I love how this game is so realistic but they should have us get more coins. And they should have an easier way of getting friends. So great game but needs some improvements.
B000SP3DE2|4.0|A couple of things flop around in my mind's eye when I think about this movie. At least half of those reading this should understand what I'm talking about.
B0090SI42Y|5.0|only kung fu hustle remains more endeared to me then this new masterpiece of the brutal arts.  if you like cheesy kung fu movies with over the top violence and funny tongue in cheek moments, then youll enjoy this movie.

B005S9EK5Y|5.0|love this movie
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Some people said they were not happy with what happened to Peta, but I felt it made the story more dynamic, and I was satisfied with how Gale's life turned out.
1452658145|5.0|So informative and well written! Only suggestion - more practical suggestions like OneGoal for developing these skills in adolescents who haven't had them taught before.<br /><br />Thank you for writing this book!
B003O86FMW|3.0|The whole idea of the games with the previous victors was a bit of a cheat and a bit strange.  The ages of the past winners made the whole scene a bit absurd.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book taught me lessons that I never knew I had to learn. That's all I want to write. Thank you, John.

B00AEFXV3E|5.0|Excellent Movie and touching story!  Anthony Hopkins, John Hurt and Anne Bancroft were great.  Very similar to the book by Christie Sparks.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|story keeps on getting better i think i like book two better than book one i couldnt quit reading it!
B009F7ORQW|3.0|I wanted to get my three year old a car for her dolls and I didn't want to spend a lot of money. This car fit the bill. It's is just a plain plastic car- no sounds or moving parts (except for the wheels). It seats two dolls. My daughter has a hard time getting the dolls in their seats by herself, so that is just kind of annoying when she gets frustrated and I have to come in and help. Also, this car has seat belts, which is a nice nod to safety, but in practicality they just get in the way. I keep them undone because it is nearly impossible to fit a full size doll in under the belt. But I like the car for what it is. A three year old doesn't have a lot of expectations for a toy like this, so I didn't want to pay for a lot of features.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|love it quick download into kindle would buy again off seller,u really cant beat games of thrones great story ,cant beat kindle download quick and easy!
B00C1BUYX4|1.0|We rented this movie, but after 1/3 it stopped and then ever time we tried to restart it our Roku umped back to the Amazon menu. Please refund our rental so we can rent this at a later date.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Been using this app for about a year and a half now. I really like the option to simply shake my phone to snooze the alarm or forcing myself to solve math equations in order to turn the alarm off.
B003AIEOCY|5.0|For me, it´s the best Rolling Stones album ever. Great vinyl quality! If you like this old guys sound, you need to have this album.  I Recommend.
B008UTV6S8|5.0|Paul Simon is a phenomenon. He seems to be able to just keep turning out really great new songs - maybe not every album, but certainly this one is excellent. A great gift for anyone who enjoys Paul Simon.
193418070X|4.0|Audiobook Review:<br />A fantastic action filled book that kept me gasping and screaming inside throughout the entire audiobook experience. Emma Powell may sound a little monotonous when the story commences, but at the end do I only love her voice and how she manages to switch to each character's voice flawlessly. I will definitely be buying the audiobook of Fire to hear her lovely narration once again.<br /><br />To be one hundred percent honest, I've picked this book up at least 3 times from the library in attempt to read this book. Must I say, I hated Graceling's guts. There writing seemed too monotonous and quite not 'grabbish' at all. Graceling, like many other books, Finnikin of the Rock etc, seem to have a script more comprehend able for adults. So the audio experience was perfect for me. While the start was equally not too capturing my attention, 1/5 of my way through, I couldn't stop this masterpiece. I truly regret throwing nasty glares and frustrated punches at Graceling in the past.<br /><br />In a world of great fantasy, there are the exploited and feared, Graced. Katsa is graced with something most atrocious, killing. When the father of the King of Liend was mysteriously captured, Katsa is trapped in a sudden new perspective and goal. As she ventures for answers, she finds and uncovers more secrets than she ever expected.<br /><br />Katsa is graced with something vicious, fighting. She was absolutely the character I was expecting; kick ass, merciless and 'anti feminist' about herself. Exactly what I feared. Constantly, I felt like screaming at Katsa, \\"Would you stop being so annoyed about your ladylike-ness!\\" While it wasn't a big issue, I never like characters that are so anti about themselves, thankfully, a million amazing factors cover irritation up.<br />Bitterblue is one of my favourite characters in this book. She shows up at about halfway and she shows such great willingness and strength through such hard times. This just goes to show that supporting characters can be made even more likeable the main character, this is not bad nor good.<br /><br />Po is the love interest in Graceling. And a really superbly created one. He is like the control of Katsa, he kept her in line, kept her true to herself. Po, like Katsa is graced with fighting so immediately I felt like that connection clicked them together. I love this couple a whole lot and hope I will see them in the Fire of Bitterblue.<br /><br />Don't let the beginning deceive you, as when the story progressed I was literally in Katsa's world. The plot Kristin manipulated was astonishingly unexpected, I couldn't really register my awe at numerous scenes that crumpled me into pieces. I can close to cry 3 times and shredded a tear at the end because of the magnificent ending. Graceling promises gun loads of action, romance and dark revelations.<br /><br />I feel ashamed for turning this novel times before as now I'm regretting every second of it. Graceling tore my heart into two while throwing me into heart stopping action simultaneously. Recommended to lovers of action and Finnikin of the Rock.

B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game is great for people that love a good mystery.  I love playing these games. I will defiantly purchase this one.
B007ZD17XO|4.0|Great game to pass the time with. Very addictive and fun. Every one should have this one. Wish there were more games like this to play.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|this is fast becoming one of my favorites. beautiful graphics. a creative alternative to usual jigsaw puzzles. goes from easy to challenging gameplay. but most of all really beautifully put together which makes it a pleasure to play.
B004RUF9DC|5.0|As the title implies, it is a great telling of the Life of Jesus, made in a simpler time in the US
B005K17RU0|1.0|used this app all the time but the upgrade has ruined it.  I will be deleating it today.  take a hint don't download this app.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|It gives me something to do to pass the time.  It doesn't require any thinking, which is sometimes a good thing.  But we all need something to exercise our brains.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|Though this is not the actual play/operatta, the costumes, the acting and the music was enough to make you think you were there.  I've YouTubed &#34;Bring Him Home&#34; and listened to many other productions of this song.  Sorry, HJ, no one holds a candle to the clear, crisp voice of Alfie Boe.  The reunion at the end was heart-warming.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|In my opinion, this is one of Nicholas Spark's best books. I have read several since he is one of my favorite authors. This has the romance but is a thriller at the same time. I love the ending, I never would have guessed it.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Caught the end of the movie with Donald Sutherland.  Had to reread the book.  Excellent!  Am now going to reread his other spy novels.  As you know he is a fantastic author.  Well worth the time.
B0049VZ222|5.0|I just started watching the show and I cannot stop. Its scary as well as addictive. Can't wait to watch season 2 and 3.
1589946634|5.0|I'll start off by saying I'm a huge fan of the Space Hulk board game.  The combination of timed strategy with limited options in tight quarters against a vast hoarde of bloodthirsty aliens?  Doesn't get much better than that.<br /><br />I was a bit skeptical on how that sort of gameplay would convert to a card based game.  I have nothing against card based games - I love Race for the Galaxy and Cards Against Humanity, but it seemed like an odd choice for a direction to go with Space Hulk.  However, my worries were completely unfounded.<br /><br />The game is simple to play - by the 3rd turn you have a great grasp of everything you can do, and why you would want to do those actions.  But the game is not an easy one - it will kick your butt, and hard, if you don't think about what you're doing and why.  Make a mistake, and the game likely won't forgive you for it.  Make the right choice, and there's a good chance the game won't care, and still punish you for it.<br /><br />The element of chance in the game is probably the most frustrating aspect, but it's just as satisfying when the genestealers miss your guys on what should have been an easy kill as it is frustrating when you do the same thing to them.<br /><br />The nice thing about the game, and one of the reasons I picked it up, is that it is playable solo.  All of the rules are exactly the same, the only difference is you have control over all the characters, and not just some of them.  This makes the game slightly easier, as you can strategize a lot better between what you're going to do and how you're going to do it, but the game is still tough.<br /><br />If you like strategy games, especially those you can play solo or with friends, I would highly recommend this.  The game takes about 45 minutes the first time you play it, but that time will easily come down to 30 minutes once you understand the rules and know how the game plays on each turn.
B003I55BIA|5.0|Cute book perfect for young adults 15 and up. The story was entertaining. It's a clean book that's not offensive.
B003H6KRIE|1.0|I returned this the first time because the first movie kept causing my Blu Ray player to freeze. No other discs caused this problem, so I figured it was a fluke and exchanged it for a new one. The new set arrived and had the same exact issue. Not sure what the deal is, but it was very disappointing, and I'm not going through the hassle again.
0345803507|5.0|THIS TRILOGY WAS AWESOME!  DEFF NOT A TEENAGE ROMANCE NOVEL.  E L JAMES DID AN AWESOME JOB.  IF YOU WANT TO READ AN EROTIC ROMANCE GO FOR THE TRILOGY.

B009X01C64|3.0|I love most of this case, but I am considering sending it back for another. My main problem is what I perceive to be a design flaw. This is supposed to be a smart case, when you open it the Kindle screen comes on, when you close it the screen goes off. The problem is, it only works when the Kindle is situated the proper way. The Kindle can rotate in this case, the rotation is not difficult, but it is not easy either. When you rotate the Kindle to take advantage of the smart case feature you cannot access the charge port. When the charge ports are accessible you have to use the power button. (I know, I know, first world problems...) But it is enough to make me want a different case.<br /><br />I will decide in the next couple days if I want to send this back and get a different one.
1451695195|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  And I believe this truly happened to Mr. Alexander.  His story touched me deeply.  I'm so glad that I read it!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Very powerful app, and the best thing is that it's free! I like that you can create and save notes, which is a very important feature to me, plus you can compare different versions of the Bible to get a better understanding of what it's saying.
0553804367|5.0|I have a number of books by Stephen Hawking that I have enjoyed very much.  This book was no exception.  The book was greatly discounted.  It was packaged very well.
0061478784|4.0|Cute enough, but not what I expected at all.<br />Plot: 2/5 Excellent climax and conclusion to a barely existent plot line.<br />SPOILER<br />The romance at the end seemed a little out of nowhere.<br />Characters: 5/5 I can't deny it. I loved them all.<br />Setting: 4/5 Inventive and creative, but I wish the author had explained it a little more.<br />Narration style: 3/5 Cute, in a quaint, meandering sort of way.<br />Total: 14/20 A sweet story with people I loved and related to living in a beautiful world. If only it had a decent plot line...By the way, Studio Ghibli fixed that in the film adaptation, which was a darker, condensed version of the book in my opinion. Definitely for a younger, or at least less serious audience.

B007REW8DO|5.0|All the songs are good!  My husband sang to Jar of Hearts which we first saw on so you think you can dance.
0307236722|3.0|This WOULD have been a great bakers hand book had Martha decided to give us something other<br /> than average (at best) American take on yeasted bread. Keep all thr other chapters, rip out Martha's take on bread...insert Peter Reinharts yeasted breads. THEN you'd have a great bakers handbook.

If you haven't already heard Of Monsters and Men, your missing out on a fun Icelandic Sound. The two lead singer's voices are amazing. I hear this playing on the radio as well.

B00012QM9K|5.0|This story was heartrending.  My tears flowed as the end came.  Excellent mastery of black and white.  So true to the facts and truly shows the depravity of man as well as the depth of heart for the small number of heros. Never Forget!
B00005JNQS|5.0|Like so many children's movies, there is a good lesson behind it. I only allow the children to watch them with me though, because like almost all children's movies, there are a few words/phrases that I find unacceptable. However this is a cute movie about not giving up on your dreams and sticking by your friends.
B000683VI4|5.0|This was exceptional.  Took a while to catch on as to who was who but the end was something of a surprise, yet not, at the same time.
076421120X|5.0|You all know I love my devotionals, so when I find one that stands out I gotta share it. Friends, this devotional is absolutely beautiful! I received this devotional last week and just couldn't put it down. I have the hardback form and the coloring is just exquisite. The inside detailing and coloring is just as gorgeous. Its inviting and once you open it you want to remain there. I think it would be difficult just to stop at reading day one. Yes, it's that good.<br /><br />Why am I in love with this devotional? Well, the devotions are dated. This is just a little something I enjoy because on many occasions that devotion for that day is just what I need. Each month begins with a hand written song lyric from Darlene.<br /><br />For instance, in April, it begins with this song:<br /><br />Only thou art holy,<br />There is none beside thee,<br />Perfect in power, in love, and purity.<br /><br />Holy, Holy, Holy! Lord God almighty!<br />All thy works shall prise they name,<br />In earth and sky and sea;<br /><br />Holy, Holy, Holy! Merciful and mighty,<br />God in three persons, blessed trinity.<br /><br />Holy One, be lifted high!﻿<br /><br />I spent much time reading through April yesterday as it leads us through the death and resurrection of Christ. I can tell you that I was blessed to tears as I read Darlene's words.<br /><br />Each devotion begins with scripture. Darlene that shares from her heart and ends the devotion with a prayer. Here is an example from August 9:<br /><br />Don't Judge<br /><br />﻿Do not judge others, and you will not be judged. For you will be treated as you treat others. The standard you use in judging is the standard by which you will be judged. Matthew 7:1-2 NLT<br /><br />I know there is a right and wrong. In the spiritual realm, there is good fruit and bad fruit. There are true teachers and false teachers. Jesus himself tells us, \\"Not everyone who says to Me, 'Lord, Lord', shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven\\" (v21, NKJV)<br /><br />What are we to make of Jesus' command not to judge? It would seem that sure and active judgment is needed every step of the way in life. But just as not forgiving others blocks forgiveness in our lives, so judging others brings forth greater judgment in our lives. Could it be that when we take on the task of judging, we are trying to assume what God reserves for himself?<br /><br />When we become judgemental, we make the easy step to feeling self-righteous and forget how much we ourselves have been forgiven. We also make mistakes when we judge. We don't always get the facts straight, and we certainly can't see into some one's heart. We add anger and worry to our lives and lost focus on what matters. We even lose sight of our own shortcomings. Jesus says, \\"And why worry about a speck in your friend's eye when you have a log in your own? How can you think of saying to your friend, 'Let me help you get rid of that speck in your eye', when you can't see past the log in your own eye? Hypocrite! First get rid of the log in your own eye; then you will see enough to deal with the speck in your friend's eye.\\" (vv.3-5)<br /><br />Father, you alone can judge the hearts of men and women. I know you want me to live wisely and righteously, but help my focus to be on sharing the good news of your kingdom and trusting you to bring conviction to the hearts of others.<br /><br />The entire devotional is based on scripture. Darlene keeps the focus on scripture and how we can apply it to our heart today. I am currently reading through this devotional now with my Bible to begin each morning. This is fabulous tool for the journey to finding a deep and passionate faith.<br /><br />This devotional was a gift from Bethany House for my review.﻿My Father in heaven\\" (v21, NKJV)<br /><br />What are we to make of Jesus' command not to judge?

B003PBB4ME|4.0|I believe this accessory perform the job for what it was designed for.  This not a \\"stabilizing\\" shoulder mount, but a stabilizer when sitting on its feet or to use the handle to the side to better grip the camera.  It was a lot easier to use the handle than the hand grip which forces you to crock your wrist to keep the camera level.  I use the handle with the Canon HF G20, on and off the tripod this weekend, with a shotgun mike on top.  I like the mike better on the top of this handle than mounted on the shoe on the camera.  I personally do not like all the weight of a shock mounted mike putting on that pressure on the case of the camera.  The top shoe can be position in any direcction.<br />If the camera mount screw is too long, I would suggest grinding down the end to shorten the amount of threads rather than use washers in between the base and the camera. Shorten the threads allows the camera bottom to fit flush on the bottom to the mount, providing a better grip.

B000R9RGF6|5.0|I first heard parts of Divenire on cable TV.  I meant to purchase it sooner but never got around to it.  I rate this right up there with George Winston.  A pleasure to hear and I never get tired of it.  I will be playing it around holidays, as well.  If you enjoy piano you should enjoy this.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I chose a 5-star highest rating for &#34;Lincoln&#34;; it was just my kind of movie; I have to watch it again probably at 3 more times to get all the dialogue and mark down some names in my mind to look them up on the internet for the historical data on these characters; one or two I recall learning about in High School ha ha.  but seriously, it is a remarkable movie; Daniel Day Lewis was perfect as Lincoln and Sally Field had some wonderful dialogues and monologues (apparently she never held back on her thoughts!).  poor Abe was apparently born having infinite patience in all things personal and political.  THe congressional sessions were funny and irreverant; loved these scenes.  and they made made many of the characters and their dialogues funny too while keeping historical accuracy hopefully.  the main subject of the movie; passing the abolition of slavery amendment was explained so that I learned something; that the timing of the passage of the amendment was important as if Lincoln framed it in the light of it's passage speeding the end to the was.  If he waited until after the was, it probably would not have passed, even though apparently Jefferson David was ready to agree to end the war immediately; Lincoln insisted on passing the amendment beforehand.  so I learned some things (stuff they don't teach or didn't teach in my American History class I don't think.)  excellent movie in every aspect.  should have won for &#34;Best Picture&#34; except who can win over the glamourous tale of present day spies and running around Middle Eastern airports?
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I am in love with this movie!! It is so funny, I can watch it over and over. Product was shipped quickly and arrived quickly overall I am pleased with this purchase.
B00712Y28Q|5.0|While I haven't played Other M, and to be honest I don't plan to, I'm fully aware of the big Nintendo franchise, and have the Prime trilogy next to play after MGS. I think this outfit is the closest we're going to get the Prime design, and it's the best figure version of her to date.<br /><br />I'm very happy that Max Factory has taken the Nintendo franchise and spewed out Link and Samus. We're closer to getting a full Super Smash Bros. match-up, what with Nendo Sonic already out, and the Revoltech Snake coming soon. Now, if only I can get my hands on that Takara magnetic Kirby...<br /><br />Anywho, I was excited about this figure when they announced, and the promo pictures did not disappoint. I like the gloss paint they used to show off her armor, and the blast beams are great effect pieces. This is one of the better figma, and it's really no surprise at the astronomical prices this figure is currently asking for. I paid base price, and I'm more than satisfied.<br /><br />It has standard figma articulation, but some of the armor restricts full poseability, such as the head. Because of the oblong shape of her helmet, there's not much motion there, but there is just enough. When I cracked this box open, some of the joints were understandably stiff, but her blaster (sorry if I got the name wrong; as I've mentioned, I've still to play the game) is considerably stricter to rotate between opened and closed. The effect parts fit in smoothly, so there's little trouble there.<br /><br />As I've said, she's got the standard figma articulation, the exemption being wherever her armor restricts, so you can pose her in any dynamic pose you'd like. She includes the standard figma stand, which comes in great usefulness for her posing. She includes a healthy amount of optional hands, including a thumbs-up one.<br />It's a shame she doesn't come with a Metroid, and that you have to buy the statue of her Zero Suit version to get it, but oh well.<br /><br />The finish is great. I had no paint slops on mine, and the armor sheens brilliantly. All in all, it's a fantastic figure. I wouldn't pay anywhere near the prices some scalpers are asking, but it's up to you. If I didn't have her, I'd wait for a hopeful rerelease.no paint slops on mine, and the armor sheens brilliantly. All in all, it's a fantastic figure.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I grabbed this omnibus on a friend's suggestion, not knowing anything about the author or the story. By the end of Book 1, I was intrigued. By the end of Book 2, I was engaged. By Book 3, I was completely hooked!<br /><br />Howey has crafted a very deep, but isolated, little universe here, with characters with believable motives, dreams and aspirations. I only recently learned that there are more stories in this saga, and I can't wait to get started on them!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|if you hate this game and you cant figure what to say on how bad it was, you cant, because it's too good of a game. best graphics and it interacs well. I think vector unit Inc is the best game creator. you really need to try this game. seriously. try it.

0385360169|5.0|I had no idea what this story was about which made it better. I listened to the CD version in my car which made driving so much more enjoyable. This was a subject I did not know much about. Some complained about the writing style, which I really didn't care about. The author was not writing a technical paper for college. I was intrigued by this fascinating unique subject. I would not want to try it but enjoyed learning about it.

B00846REIS|4.0|\\"Bared to You\\" was a good read. You have Eva, Gideon and Cary all three have a past they'd rather forget but can't seem to move on from. Take the three of them and add drama, secrets, scandals, lust, love and ex's and it makes a fun, hot and sexy read. This book kept me interested and I read it in one day but it is not 50 Shades of Grey, which I've read and love. \\"Bared to You\\" is a series that leaves you wanting more of Eva, Gideon and Cary. You will love the characters with all of their flaws; this book will make you smile, laugh, get upset, and wanting to shake the hell out of all three of them but it is definitely worth reading.

B0091REZMW|5.0|love this game. always changing. never ending. challenging. if your looking for something ongoing with great graphics, this is a great game!
B000PDYVVG|5.0|I think you need to be both.  Those who don't self-examine usually end up old and cranky.  So, unlike many of the other reviewers, I don't find the character offensive.<br /><br />I enjoyed taking this journey with her.  I enjoyed her sense of humor.  I don't think I would have liked it if it were more 'serious', or more light-hearted.  Yet I feel just a bit let down at the end.  It is too \\"perfect\\" a romance.  I just don't believe it.<br /><br />And if she thinks she now has it pretty much all figured out, boy is she in for a bunch of surprises over the next 35 years!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I like this game b/c you get to take care of the pets &amp; play w/them. I recommend this game to others.
B00BBQXQFI|4.0|This was entertaining for kids and adults can enjoy it as well.  It was sugary and sweet but struck the right balance with enough humor, discovery, and wonder as to not be inane for an adult audience.  It doesn't have as solid a story or message as many from the Pixar collection, or How to Train Your Dragon, but it was good enough to be better than OK.

140130916X|3.0|I picked up the book P.S. I Love You by Cecilia Ahern because I was looking for a story for my daughter to turn into a monologue for her speech group. I had seen the movie and knew it to be a tearjerker. Just what we were looking for.<br /><br />It didn't really work for my purposes. Too many characters and too convoluted of a plot to cut down to 10 minutes. But more than that, I didn't really like it.<br /><br />The main character, Holly, has just lost her husband and best friend, Gerry, to cancer. Unbeknownst to her, he has arranged for monthly letters to be opened by her containing things she is to do. His goal is to help her get through the first year without him and move on with her life. His final letter gives her the needed permission to love again.<br /><br />This is Ahern's first novel and it shows. The idea is a great one and obviously she had success with the book - it was turned into a movie after all. But her characters are paper thin. I don't like any of them. Even her heroine, Holly, strikes me as someone I would not enjoy being around. Ahern was 22 when she wrote it and the characters feel like people you would conjure up when you are 22. Lots of drama, drinking, hooking up. Even the \\"good girl\\" Holly decides she'd love nothing better than to bar hop and get fall-down drunk for her 30th birthday. When her brother makes a documentary of the pathetic ladies' night out, it's a hit. Apparently these girls appear to be living a wonderful life, making fools of themselves and revealing their souls to a taxi cab driver. Do people really live this way? If so, why should I care about them and invite that into my life?<br /><br />I wish I could take this idea and rewrite it. It's interesting and certainly not predictable. (The \\"love interest\\" turns out not to be...) I found myself desperate for a character I could relate to, someone not so supremely superficial. Even the vaunted soul mates, Holly and Gerry, seem two-dimensional. We know they are soul-mates because, well because she told us they are. I wonder if Ahern herself would write it differently now that she is 9 years older and presumably wiser. If her life mirrors her characters, I doubt it.use, well because she told us they are.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It threw me when it sound like they were waking up from a dream.  I often wondered myself why I could not feel like Sky could not feel, now I understand my own feelings.  Don't you just hate it when the molester walks around holding his head high like he has something to be proud of and yet he has so little regard of the person or persons that he hurt.  No one has any regard for the victim who has everything to be proud of because she survived and tries to move on.  This girl was a hero in my eyes  the boy was a bigger hero.  It is said that you do not forget the voice nor the words but I can't forget the smell.  Was so pleased that this book had a good ending and not a cliff hanger.  My molester told everyone that I was a whore and slept with everyone for years to cover his ass and everyone believed him because he was the pillar of the community.  He hasn't gotten away with it because God will pay him back for me and three others.  He is suffering with cancer and skin cancer and has one ear because of it.  When he dies he will burn in hell forever.  Thank you Colleen for writing this book it has helped me.  I can't move on, only God knows how I have tried.
B008N1V11U|5.0|Very Impressive. This Is Better Than ANYTHING Except For Butter Because The Graphics Really Stink. This Is Like The &quot;Golden eye 007&quot; Game Because Your Playing The Whole Move But With A Little Bit Added On To The Game, And Also The Graphics Are Bad. This Game Also Reminded Me Of &quot;Batman: Arkham City. Some Of The Things You Can Do In This Game Are Very Simple, Like Butt Kicking And Fighting Bane And MISC. I Also Recommend This Game Because It Is Worth The $7.00 And Is LEGIT. So, When You Get The Money, Use It On This Game. As I Said: &quot;Its Worth The $7.00 And Is LEGIT&quot;.<br /><br />-Nolan.Pruitt
0141040343|5.0|I love this book it is so cute! I would recommend it to someone else. The cover is really nice.
030771652X|3.0|Eh.. it was okay. Someone recommended so I came here to check it out. The premise sounded interesting and it had plenty of positive reviews so I thought I'd give it a whirl. When I first started reading, I was like.. Oh I can't read this.. no way. But thankfully, I hung on and around about page 10 or 12, I was pretty engaged. It did start to wear thin after awhile. Slow moving at times, and towards the end I was praying for it to end.  I don't think there were any great twists , and it sort of all deflated for me. Still, parts were very enjoyable, interesting and I thought she did an excellent job of describing someone suffering from profound grief. Not sorry I read it, but definitely could not re-read.
B00AFYZDL2|5.0|These guys just get BETTER with age; the ENTIRE album ROCKS!!!  Even the bonus disc with updated versions of classics sounds FANTASTIC...  'Nuff said!!!
B00B69UQJY|5.0|I have been listening to Depeche Mode ever since their single Dreaming of Me became a minor hit in 1981. Although they constantly came up with great singles, I found their albums as a whole more as a set of songs that ranged from being great to being anything but great. This began changing gradually with Black Celebration showing signs of the band creating a distinctive and cohesive sound. Despite finding Music for the Masses being rather bleak when initially released, time has proved that it had a perfect blend of a dark sonic landscape but yet very melodic tunes. The album maybe more importantly at the time was a definite starting point in the masses taking Depeche Mode more seriously as an album act. When they thus followed it up with Violator and the MTV friendly Enjoy the Silence the group had evolved into being one of the biggest groups in the world and deservedly so. That album is still among my all-time favorites.<br /><br />While their less synth follow-up, Songs of Faith and Devotion, was from my standpoint an uneven project and somewhat a disappointment, I really loved Ultra, which was made in the shadow of David Gohan's drug problems and Alan Wilder leaving the band. Ultra was as if Depeche Mode had some point to prove and songs like It's No Good and Home are simply classics. After having hit such a high another let-down was in store with Exciter, a bland and unloved release. During the last decade Depeche Mode have released two albums, both in my view decent efforts, especially Playing the Angel. They were not great but still amazing considering how long the three core members have worked together. Their sales were, however, rather disappointing.<br /><br />Their latest release, Delta Machine, has thus not been extremely anticipated. The lead track, Heaven, may though have increased the anticipation because it is among their strongest songs ever, hitting a balance of raw energy and still the classic Depeche Mode synth sound. I pre-ordered Delta Machinenot only because it is a Depeche Mode release but have been excited about their new sound, hoping that Heaven is not a flux on the album. In the week before its release, Depeche Mode have made it available to listen on iTunes and Spotify, giving me an opportunity to listen to it several times. This is becoming rather common, adding excitement to new releases. This strategy could, however, backfire since if people's reaction and thus word of mouth is negative, some may pull back their pre-orders. There should be no such concern regarding Delta Machine.<br /><br />In short, this album is among DM's best ever release; how on earth do they still make such good music after three decades together? The production is brimming with energy, hitting a perfect balance between their classic style and yet with with new sounds still entering the frame. It is rather alike the sound on Ultra but slightly more complex, not as straightforward, and overall a more lush atmosphere despite having raw elements.<br />This is evident in the opening track, Welcome to My World, a slow stylish track that moves assuredly but yet has many instruments (and vocals) that work perfectly together. The next track, Angel, is not unlike Heaven, rather slow beat count wise but very strong melody; which leads to Heaven itself, one of their best tracks. The first possibly radio friendly track follows, the excellent Secret to the End, which is rocks in DM style and is practically impossible to get out of ones head. I do not think that any Depeche Mode album has started so strongly in their career.<br /><br />My Little Universe follows, a track that could easily have been on their previous two releases and would definitely had been one of the highlights of those releases. Slow follows, a rather bluesy track, not one of the strongest tracks on DM but yet among their stronger ones in their career. It is a grower. Broken and The Child Inside come next; these are the weakest tracks on DM, sort of come and go without an impact. Soft Touch / Raw Nerve gets things moving again, as the title indicates a rather raw and energetic track. Should Be Higher comes next; another radio friendly track with a fantastic chorus. Alone is very moody and lush while Sooth My Soul (a future single, with traces of Personal Jesus) is the opposite, both good tracks but not yet among the highlights, which includes the final song, Goodbye. The guitar in the song reminds me somewhat of Freestate, among my favorites of Ultra. Goodbye may, however, be even better, a slow track and probably the best singing of the whole album; what a way to finish it.<br /><br />Of the 13 songs on DM, there are in my opinion thus two so-so tracks, with the rest ranging evenly from being good to fantastic. Below is a list of my favorite Depeche Mode albums. Time may obviously change my opinion in either direction regarding Delta Machine but most often albums tend to grow on people. Ultra may gain the edge after a while; I have difficulties choosing between those two for second spot. Those who beg to differ on what constitutes great Depeche Mode albums probably may have different ideas than I do regarding Delta Machine. I may sound like a commercial, but those in a similar DM wavelength as I am should absolutely not let Delta Machine pass them by.<br /><br />1. Violator<br />2. Delta Machine<br />3. Ultra<br />4. Music For the Masses<br />5. Playing the Angel<br /><br />Addition April 11, 2013 - This rather slow & moody album has been in constant rotation since I initially wrote this review. It is without doubt their best release since Violator. Also, while the Deluxe version looks very nice, the extra tracks are obvious inferior B-side candidates.
B000002GBB|4.0|After hitting a new commercial and artistic peak with \\"The Grand Illusion,\\" Styx wanted to prove that they could rock it with the best of them. \\"Pieces of Eight\\" was well received at the time of its release, but it hasn't aged well. It peaked at number six, and was made while the band was still getting along with each other.<br /><br />\\"Pieces of Eight\\" also contains Styx's best rock song in the working man's anthem \\"Blue Collar Man.\\" Anchored by a huge organ riff and Tommy Shaw's vocal, it sounded big, made for the arena. Shaw also penned \\"Renegade,\\" the album's other hit and nearly as powerful. Problem is, Dennis DeYoung hadn't reached his ballad-meister phase and his two songs are the dopey \\"Lord of The Rings\\" and the title track. Led Zep had already done the Mordor thing and had done it infinitely better. The sword and fantasy bit had even been done better by Styx themselves on \\"The Grand Illusion's\\" \\"Castle Walls.\\"<br /><br />When the band lightened up a bit, they also showed a knack for delivering some decent material. The stately \\"Sing for The Day\\" and positive thinking \\"I'm OK\\" (James Young and DeYoung penned that one) were good, folksy pop. At the time, Styx were one of the most popular bands in America, and the solid rocking and prog-lite of \\"Pieces of Eight\\" made 1978 sound stately.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Great as good if not better than the first lots of story action and sex all actors do a fine job when I finished the series I started to watch again can't wait for the next one its showing now on hbo will buy the next from amazon
1401324649|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the 100 year old man.  I gave it to my husband,  he loved it.  I used it as a &#34;prize'  for a Christmas swap,  and it was the most sought-after prize (after a &#34;set-up&#34; by me describing the premise).  One of the women used it as a 'book club book'  and she reported universal good reviews.  I give it as gifts now!

Everything you need to start bodybuilding.<br /><br />I would have rated it 5 stars, but the binding isn't the greatest and the pages have already started to come out. I am going to put it in a large 3 ring binder with divider tabs for easy reference.

B001TCHDPS|5.0|Wonderful, I would like to see him in concert. Would like more music from Mr Rodriguez. Thanks you Mr Rodriguez

B0071XO8RA|5.0|beautifully written, captivating, powerful. highly recommended to anyone who thinks about humans and what they're capable of. looking forward to the film adaptation.
6305692572|1.0|This movie was supposed to be a new one not used well there is a whole section of the movie that is cut out and its freezes and skips in one spot and then just jumps to another section...  Not happy with this at all. And this was a hard to find movie I love it...
B00AB2NYNC|5.0|Cool packaging and book.  Although I already had Babel it was worth it for the live Red Rocks version.  These guys are great and I'm looking forward to seeing them in Sept at the Guthrie GOTR stop.

B0000VCZKM|5.0|best movie for my kids! They see it almost everyday! I have it in my tablet as well, so they can watch it whenever they want.
B00005JPCF|5.0|The movie was very uplifting and had a story of personal sacrifice and determination to help his people survive a lack of fish.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I laugh, I cry, I am addicted.  I love Jane Austin and period style peices so if you do too you will love this series.
B003UD7JEE|5.0|I love all the fight scenes and the interactions between Nikita and Michael. It cracks me up how he is sent to kill her, but every time he saves her life or she saves his. I love their chemistry. Shane West is so sexy.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|This has to be the best movie of the 007's for this actor.  I liked it much more than the others and it was nice to see &#34;M&#34; come back and bring in a few of the gadgets.
B000K7VHQ4|3.0|It wasn't all that I thought it was going to be but it was alright. I would not reccomend buying this unless your into this kinda drama
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love how there is an Easter egg hunt. But you should not have to collect so many character tokens.

B0079IEPHA|5.0|Chose this rating because I love the characters and the story lines. Very well put together. Awesome show. Great job
B000FCK65W|4.0|I liked the book very much.  Very true to life and showed just what goes through the mind of someone growing up.
1595827684|5.0|'Nuff said!Aside from the lack of credit to the artists, this is highly enjoyable fan art of the world's current-best game.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|I'm a huge action fan, so this movie was chalk full of it!  Since it's Sylvester Stallone, it can get a little cheesy sometimes, but overall I quite enjoyed watching it.  The plot is pretty basic:  bad guy kills one of their men, they get angry, they go after bad guys in massive attack mode.  I was unbelievably excited when I heard Jean-Claude Van Damme was in this movie, but turns out he's the bad guy.  I was really hoping to see him be a part of the Expendables team, but alas I was not granted my wish.  There is a really epic fight scene at the end of the movie with him though, so it is totally worth the watch.
0316017930|5.0|Recommended by a young smart teenager to me.  Really opens up your mind to looking at people and possibilities differently.  I recommend this book to everyone.
B005CRQ2DK|4.0|It was really good and the Americans could win the declaration of independence and keeping it was an aid to fight for the British
1449410243|5.0|My cat is, in fact, plotting my demise, so I appreciated the heads-up on how to spot a plot in progress.  The Oatmeal is hilarious.
B005SAXZYU|5.0|\\"It is not easy to suppress yourself to become another. Often I wanted to be myself and free.\\"<br />-quote from Akira Kurosawa's Kagemusha.<br /><br />Set in the Sengoku Era of Japan, Kurosawa's masterful (if historically inaccurate) story deals with one ambitious warlord's orders that end up severely straining and testing the very limits of his subjects' loyalty. In a society built upon the very notion of honor and duty, how much is one meant to endure in order to keep a promise? How much of our behavior results in a change of fate, or are we doomed to forever live in the shadow of our predestined fates?<br /><br />Is free will futile? If not, then to what degree is free will necessarily a good thing if it constantly torments us to do things we musn't?<br /><br />Deeper, unanswered questions such as these rise again and again, albeit in subtle form, interlaced with the film's surreal, beautiful cinematography.
B000ICXQHE|5.0|This is a terriffic flick, keeps you guessing, and trying to figure out ( like the dective) who and what's going.
B0058A11AK|5.0|Great!  This is a great album.  Barbara is at her best for sure.  I look forward to her next release.
B00009NHC5|5.0|A must see movie!! This is one of the most thrilling movies of all time to come out of Hollywood.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|Wonderful design.<br />Just about everything about the notifications is editable (if you can find the settings). The presentation is awesome with lots of visuals, and more information that I would ever need.
B0058YPGL6|4.0|The show is well written and keeps one entertained.  The visual quality and sound are very good.  Where were shows like this when they stopped showing Aeon Flux, years ago?
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I loved using Reader for reading my blogs and reluctantly switched to Feedly, knowing I would have to find an alternative eventually.  The switch was seamless, very easy, and now I actually prefer Feedly over Reader.
B0050DIWFC|1.0|The author develops characters that you can't possibly care about; in fact, you actively dislike them. There is no murder investigation and some details don't make sense.  Had to thumb through it to get it finished and behind me.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Christina McKenna captured loss and redemption.  The feelings of inadequacy and hopelessness give way to the salvation of connectedness.  In loneliness lies grief.  Only friendship and true caring assuage the pain. This book is well worth reading.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|This is one of my favorite musicals of all time. I totally adore this wonderful and great muciscal. Well worth the buy.
0226264211|4.0|Having been first exposed to Milton Friedman by way of his \\"Free To Choose\\" TV series (which now lives on in its entirety on YouTube), I was excited and fascinated to read his works.  This was my first Friedman book, and while engaging in many parts, I found myself having a hard time understanding several sections of it.  This was particularly frustrating as I was feeling pretty well versed in Friedman's school of economics, having previously read Thomas Sowell's \\"Basic Economics\\" and \\"Applied Economics.\\"<br /><br />I found his chapters on minimum wage, discrimination, social welfare, the alleviation of poverty, and government's role in education to be particularly interesting.  Where he talks about the control of money, international trade arrangements, and agricultural commerce, I had a hard time comprehending the information ... partly because I find these topics a bit drier personally, but also because I have a lesser understanding of these topics in general, which I think most readers share with me.<br /><br />Clearly this is an adored book, and the high reviews are what made me pick it up ... but if you're looking for a solid primer on economic philosophy that's easy to absorb and digest, I'm not sure this is it.  I'll come back and give this another read--perhaps after reading Friedman's more iconic work, \\"Free to Choose.\\"<br /><br />Friedman uses the word \\"liberal\\" in its classic meaning, which is definitely NOT the liberal of today, and much more aligned with conservatism and/or libertarianism.  In the first couple chapters it required a conscious effort to remind myself of his meaning, but I got used to it before too long.
B0063M22QO|4.0|When I have a few minutes I like to play Mahjong.  It is colorful and easy to play.  It is a game that does not requirea lot of thinking.  It is relaxing?  I think you will enjoy it if you try it.
B003Y3AZSW|3.0|Boards score deeply and easily. And we use the veg board far more often than the others. Would be great if the tabs could be interchangeable.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Loved the RACKETEER!!!!!! The story keep me reading until finished. My best friend read this book, first  GRISHAM, now he is HOOKED. Keep them coming. Thank you.
B0087GF8ZG|4.0|Sensitive to ambient light, but when properly shielded works well. Worth the price and effective. Wish there wew a bit more range.
B004SIP8BG|5.0|Martial arts action scenes excellently choreographed. Whole movie has a beautiful poetic quality enhanced by magnificent sound track. Leaves one pondering about heroism. Special features a real bonus.
B0091V6TF4|5.0|Great having all the themes in one spot (they should have figured out how to get Skyfall on this!)<br /><br />First disc all themes, second is all other music from movies--from previous compilations few items removed, that's too bad, but a great collector's item!
140053271X|5.0|My 9 year old grandson asked me for a NOOK for his birthday. I never heard of a &#34;NOOK&#34;! I bought this one and I am enjoying it so much that I want one for myself. I see the days of the text-book becoming a thing of the past. Get this, you'll be very satisfied. Easy on the eyes. Great Job B&N.
B001NHNG64|3.0|This book was not as exciting as the first Lee Child book.  It lagged in the middle of the book.  I am now enjoying reading his third book.
B00947N6UG|3.0|I was very disappointed to find out that the (ultraviolet)digital copy of this wonderful movie is only viewable on a desktop or laptop computer.<br /><br />You cannot save it as a true digital copy usable on a ipad or other portable devices.<br /><br />If you don't want 3d don't purchase the version that has ultraviolet digital copy.<br /><br />Other movies don't have such restrictions so beware.
030758836X|4.0|You can read the plot anywhere by now, but I will tell you my reaction to this book. It is good, even very good with twists, some of which are obvious.<br />The first half is wonderful and I was drawn in. The problem is that neither Nick nor Amy are likeable or worth caring about.<br />This story deserved an ending that kicks one in the stomach and leaves the reader reeling. but this is not a PD James or Tana French book. It dissolves into a soft puddle of acid. Not heartbreaking at any rate, just ultimately boring. Revenge here, who cares. a sequel could only be trite.<br />Yet, still that first half is so good!
B00B49L7JY|5.0|Okay this is an amazing film. You will have this story.. music.. and life lessons resinate in your core forever. What a humble man. What an amazing story. I bought the soundtrack as soon as the movie was over and re-watched the movie again. Which says a lot because I usually never watch a movie more than once~ Check it out.
B00AQMSJI2|4.0|something you dont wanna play all day but fun to check in thru out the day. Dont have to worry about something going wrong if you cant play everyday.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|First, I would like to say that although the topic nature of this book has been widely covered, the author's take was not cliche. Besides knowing Katie would have to face her past everything else in this book was surprising. I truly enjoyed the suspense.<br /><br />The book had a slow start and beginning of the middle but the ending was worth the wait! I would definitely recommend it to others. I look forward to reading more of Mr. Sparks books in the future.
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|I have no idea why there are such terrible reviews...my hubby and I laughed the entire movie!<br /><br />I think some of the scenes in the movie I've lived thru lol<br /><br />If you are married and/or have kids I think you can relate!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|There are lots of great challenging puzzle to figure out and I like that there is an interesting story line.
B00C10N3EW|5.0|Just an awesome performance. The musicians backing him are incredible. If you are a Joe Bonamassa fan this recording is a must have.
B0031Y9DCS|5.0|Awe inspiring. Helps the younger generations understand what veterans from all wars had to face in battle and in there hearts, both on the field and at home. Raw and real. Thank you
0439023513|5.0|My favorite of the series.  Much more intellectual and written for an older crowd.  Gets out of the girlish and turns Katniss into a leader.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|It is great album. I really loved the first cut,THE BOYS DOWN HERE. My grandson is sining chew tabaco chew tabaco spit.
B00846WWVM|2.0|Not very enjoyable. The game made no sense and it didn't seem to go anywhere. The character just jumped but I felt like there was no moving forward.
B005NQ5LQ4|5.0|Although this is a bit over the top in my opinion, & not necessarily reflecting the real life IP MAN (as in the 1st two movies), it is a bundle of fun from beginning to end - i like it - i'm keeping it!

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|How can I describe this book in words? Hopeless gives you hope, that there is such a thing as new beginnings.<br />Colleen Hoover has a way of writing that sucks you in. Reading Hopeless, along with her other books, I become very emotional. I'm crying and laughing and smiling whenever her characters are. This is a book that you'll want to read again and again. I've yet to find someone who evokes such emotion through her writing like she does.
B00B2TE7FC|5.0|Although they are known for their creative covers on Youtube, Walk Off the Earth is great band.  Other than Somebody That I Used to Know, the one guitar wonder, all of the songs are original.  They have a loyal fan base but are much deserving for a wide following.  All songs are unique and catchy.  Not a bad song on the album.
B008JF8O9M|1.0|This app would not work for me on my kindle fire. It installed ok, but just will not find my printer. Checked the available printers, but my Lexmark X4550 is not listed.<br />Guess I will be un-installing this app.
B0064NTZQ2|1.0|THIS review will be short and not so sweet. I watched this movie because I've heard that Ryan Gosling was such a big deal (to me - I don't see it). The first fifteen or twenty minutes I think five words were spoken; the plot was nonexistent. I wasn't sure what the hell the movie was supposed to be about but if a movie doesn't grab me in the first fifteen minutes it's  aloha!!! I could have stopped watching this movie after l0 seconds but thought it might get better--maybe it did but I wasn't willing to waste my time finding out. SAVE YOUR MONEY--THIS SHOW STINKS!!!!!!! I can't imagine why Gosling ever  got involved in this movie in the first place.
B001AQR3E4|5.0|love love love this wonderful spectacular movie. Great acting, time periods beautifully executed. I just want to watch it over and over and over again.
B000059GEI|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. I never remembered Ethel Merman being so terrific and Donald O'Connor so young. This must have been one of Marilyn's first pictures and Dan Dailey was a gem. The story is about the Five Donahue's - a vaudville act and starts off when the kids are little to when they grow up. in the musical theatre. The music is a pure delight; dancing is wonderful and well it should be - it is one of Irving Berlin's babies. He was a genius and created so many musicals and every single one of them is worth watching and enjoying.  I was particularly thrilled to be taken back to when I was a child and loved all these old musicals (and there were tons of them) and to see and hear and delight in everything the movie was about.<br />Whether you are familiar with the stars above or they are new to you I'll just bet you will love everything about this movie......there is nothing but nothing not to love--it is wonderful and well worth your time and money! (And...for Marilyn lovers this is a very young voluptuous Marilyn you don't want to miss!)<br />ENJOY!
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|The theatrical release of the movie didn't do well for so reason but I thought the movie was good.  If you like scifi I think you'll like this movie.
B008EQIEWS|4.0|Special Effects were great; acting was ok; but the story was a little weak. Worth buying just be prepared to watch multiple times to get it all.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Second season is even better. should be interesting what happens in season 3. So how soon will it be out on dvd to buy??
B00AKNYBRK|5.0|Back to the roots combined with some mellower influences. As usual Pet Shop Boys deliver! Very easy to listen to on long trips.
B00009AOBI|5.0|Cher & Sam Elliot are Awsesome together. I love how Cher Stands up for her son, and in the End Changes for better.. So Much Luv for Rocky... Brave
B004UID2LC|1.0|PLEASE give me a real YouTube app for my kindle fire!!  I tried  to download this app and my device would not allow it due to virus or spam or something. I also read other reviews with similar comments. I want the YouTube app and will not settle for less!
B000F8O35U|3.0|Ours was obviously a burn.  The cover was great, but the disk art itself was very silk screen looking, not vibrant at all.  Also it won't play on our PS3 or in the car dvd, but it worked on our computers.  At least the girls got to watch it.  The movie itself looked fine.  We really didn't pay much, so it's not a huge deal, but it's not a true copy.
B0052GACNM|5.0|Mr. Bennett remarkably is still the best make vocalist still singing.  He picked most of his partners well.  To my surprise, the best is Lady Gaga.  Great version of &#34;Lady is a Tramp.&#34;
B0071XO8RA|5.0|very happy with product, packaging, and the shipping. no problems encountered with this transaction. shipping was very fast. Satisfied customer
B000003S0J|5.0|The title of this review is a slight exaggeration, but nevertheless this album has a classical element to it. Violins take center stage here, and permeate throughout. This album is definitely an acquired taste; the songs have very complex structures and have to build momentum. In many ways, this album is very bold, in the form of being very different. The standout tracks are EXILES and LARKS TONGUES IN ASPIC PART 2. EASY MONEY is good too, and features great bass work. I recommend this album for those who want a very progressive sound, and appreciate something totally outside the box. The violin really carries this album. The second half of the album is unexpectedly heavier than the first half.
B00AA0TZTW|3.0|I received this cd as a gift and opened it with great expectations. I enjoyed the first track but then spent the rest of the time wishing again that Jimi had lived to hone his craft to what surely would have been wizardly. None of that here but fairly enjoyable.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is cool and fun. And yet very hard.I think this is better than the first temple run. It has cool graphics. I honestly think it is better than the first temple run.

B009YP9L7U|3.0|This book has everything both good and bad that you expect in a Harlequin. When you have read enough romance books, harlequins can feel a tad predictable. Boy and girl meet, boy and girl fall in love, enter a complicating factor, resolve complicating factor, happy ending... Having been said it is a good book and a quick romance read with all the classic love and butterflies that one looks for in a romance.

B004JXXKWY|5.0|I always thought the financial crises was due to a series of unfortunate events. Comparable to a plane crash.<br />A screw is loose, the inspector notices it and reports it, the report is lost due to a power outage, the backup report system is down for maintenance, the plane is allowed to fly, and it crashes due to the loose screw.<br /><br />The crises was simple. Many people didn't know how to do their jobs.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Everything about this novel flowed effortlessly and with perfect timing. If there was ever a \\"must read\\" for younger readers then I have found it in Hopeless.  The first person style writing and the angst and romance are very Stephanie Myers without the supernatural stuff.  Looking forward to reading more from Colleen Hoover.

0375703764|5.0|I've known about House of Leaves for a long time now but never got around to reading it until recently. I'm a fan of Poe (Mark's sister) and was curious to read the book because of how much it's referenced on her album &#34;Haunted&#34;. I'm so glad I decided to read this book at long last. It is by far one of the strangest things I've ever read but what an amazing read it is! The book is written in a very interesting way that engages and challenges the reader at the same time. At first I was a little worried by the size of it and the way it was written. It is a fiction book but it's written like a text book with footnotes, indexes and the works. But once I started reading it I found it easy to read and really got into the stories. The book is really two stories in one. I really liked reading this book and I liked how he referenced some of his sister's songs in the book as well. I think everyone should read this book at least once in their life. I'm really glad I did and I look forward to re-reading it in the future.
B007HACDLK|5.0|It is a pleasure to (again) read a kick- butt novel where good rules over evil.  It is unfortunate that evil (out there) does not get the message.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I had been considering reading this book for a while, but didn't actually pick it up until a season break on The Walking Dead and I needed my zombie fix. Once I did, I couldn't put it down. Brooks weaves a visual and emotional tale that really takes the romanticism out of the Zombie Apocalypse. He has a keen talent for leaving the most horrific things unsaid--cannibalism, genocide--but inferring in such a way there is no doubt that is what is taking place. The range of characters and their experiences truly gives a global view of War Z. I am still wondering about the fate of North Korea and can't get the image of the undead walking the ocean floors out of my mind. I'm sure I will read this book again.
B002WY64HA|5.0|you cannot help but love this album.  Even better that it is available on vinyl and comes with a digital download.

B009AMANBA|1.0|Just watched &#34;Lincoln&#34;. I was shocked how little it had to do with Lincoln. Should be renamed &#34;The 13th Amendment&#34; which is what this movie was about.  Not as it said on the back of the DVD &#34;the President's tumultuous four month in office as a visionary leader of the Civil War, unite the country and abolish slavery&#34;. Very little on Civil War, or the uniting of the country. Just another boring rewrite of history. Why this movie was nominated for anything is beyond me.

B0041D843M|4.0|I have to admit after reading this, I have become a convert.  Speaking as someone who was moderately overweight, \\"borderline high\\" cholesterol at 209 and had an overpowering love affair with both animal protein and processed foods, I have switch to a predominantly whole foods, plant based diet at the age of 49...  I have never felt better, felt healthier and never been so hopefully to live a full and healthful life with my family especially my 8 year old daughter!
B00BWJARHO|1.0|We rented this from Amazon.  The movie stops every 5 minutes to load.  This is an action movie and it was impossible to watch because it was always stopping.  At one point Amazon quit streaming and indicated that the movie was not available.  We didn't get to finish watching it that night.  The Amazon rental process stinks.  I won't be renting from them again.

B00AHTYI5M|2.0|Of course there were great expectations for this movie.  But it is very disappointing.  Downright boring.  Ben Affleck was poorly cast in the lead role as the operative.  He had one facial expression during the entire movie -- looking like he was thinking about something else.  It says something when Argo received \\"best movie\\" award without a best director nomination or any best actor nominations.  I think Hollywood/Academy liked this movie because a movie script was the foil for rescuing the six Americans.

0670026638|3.0|I really wanted to like this book. The New York Times review suggested the book has everything I want in it: character over plot, Japanese things and a reference to the 3/11 disaster. (Not that I want that, but as somebody who survived it, I'm interested.) I love the Japanese genre of the \\"I-novel\\" and am interested in intricate stories.<br /><br />Well. While I was more charmed than I'd expected by Nao's story, I thought the Ruth parts of the story really didn't hold up. I also had trouble with the time scale. At one point it's after 3/11, then it's back at 9/11, then...? I do realize this is part of what the author's trying to get at - time's fluidity - and fine, though it's a stretch. Then, though, there was the mushy mysticism of one part of the conclusion. Ultimately I ended up feeling cheated.
B0025T65GC|5.0|Not the prog-thrasher you would expect from the Dev, \\"KI\\" is a Dynamic and Deep release... at times soulfully sensitive and melodic, at other times its crushingly heavy.  The music, lyrics and vocals have the power to both unexpectedly tug at the heartstrings then bludgeon the brains, sometimes as seconds pass from one passage to the next.<br /><br />Its refreshing to hear the Dev take a step sideways from the trademark \\"Wall Of Sound\\" production and octave-driven riffing of his other works, instead favouring here a lean and clear, largely clean collection of songs.  Even though his approach and method here may be a little different, its still signature-Dev first class accomplishment all the way... well, most of the way!<br /><br />Basically Devin's discovered subtlety, and what we've got here is a clean album splattered with moments of shear unrelenting brutality, made to sound even more so when they leap out of the mostly chilled out, although still edgy-sounding, cruisy music.<br /><br />The opening passage \\"A Monday\\" more or less sets up the vibe of the record, with \\"Disruptr\\" and \\"Gato\\" hinting at how truly heavy this album COULD have been.  Those 2 tracks are sandwiched between the gorgeous \\"Coast\\" & \\"Terminal\\" before we get \\"Heaven Send\\" which mixes all the elements found on the album together in about 8 minutes.  With its blasting breaks and great use of lady vocals its the finest track in my opinion.<br /><br />\\"TrainFire\\" is the album's quirky and wierd oddball and probably the least accessible one here but it grows on you and eventually slots into the collection beautifully.  We get another gorgeous one - \\"Lady Helen\\" - then title track \\"Ki\\" with a truly phenomenal buildup and ending and the the fantastic sing along acoustic \\"Quiet Riot\\", which I think is where the record should have ended.  And here lies my only critisism - not only do most of the songs sort of burn up and fizzle out which is a bit disappointing, he fizzles out the actual album with the nondescript \\"Demon League\\".  After the 'finish-on-a-high' style ending of \\"Quiet Riot\\" the final track \\"Demon League\\" feels like an anti-climax.<br /><br />I've given it 5 out of 5 because \\"I Love It\\" but its really a 4 to take into account the elements that annoy me!nondescript \\"Demon League\\".

B007BFSYMS|5.0|This app has some very annoying sounds on it, but I can see how some people who live in the city might need traffic noise or people talking to sleep well. Personally, I like ocean waves (reminds me of being on the beach in Oregon) or frogs chirping (reminds me of being in the mountains after a rain). I seem to get to sleep faster and sleep better throughout the night.<br /><br />I route the sound through an amplified speaker system to help it fill the room.<br /><br />The only suggestion I would make would be to have a sleep timer that would turn off the sound after a preset amount of time.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is cool you can craft and kill creatures and animals you can get good armor for the big fights. It is good like ruleing a village and make it your kingdom. It is in a sweet block form and you can do some fun an cool stuff. I like to build what I want when I want.

0425252868|4.0|I read 'A Higher Call' with great interest since it provided a view of a conflict from the perspective of someone on 'the other side'. However, I cannot come away with the feeling that the actions of Franz Stigler were chivalrous in the true sense of the word and it appears that the people that thought most highly of his actions were American pilots, people who might have benefited from his decision to allow the crippled bomber to fly away from Germany. Other German pilots, those who went out of their way to see that enemy pilots and crew, in this case American or British personnel who bailed out of planes that they downed, were treated humanely, given medical attention when required or possible, were indeed chivalrous in their behavior. Allowing an enemy plane to return to its home base, or just escape with the possibility or returning to its home base, is not chivalrous. This action allows for the pilots and crew to return to other planes and continue to kill military personnel or civilians, on another campaign. The author even comments that towards the end of the war American and British fighter pilots were strafing German pilots in their parachutes or after they landed because the allied forces understood that they had to remove the pilots of the planes to be effective in ending the conflict; remove a plane and it can be replaced fairly quickly but remove a pilot and it takes 20 years to replace them. This type of action is far from chivalrous but it is condoned for the greater good; it is no different from the opposing side.<br />Franz Stigler indicated that General Gallant, his commander at the end of the war, said he was guilty of dereliction of duty when he found out what he did many years after the fact and would never change his opinion even though they remained friends. It is hard to think otherwise if you consider the consequences of his actions. Charlie Brown said members of his crew, together with their families, met Franz and thanked him for sparing them and allowing them to raise their children and grandchildren. Remember that Charlie Brown went on to fly almost 30 more missions over Germany and other countries in Europe and if you were to consider how many people would not raise their children or grandchildren because he and his remaining crew were allowed to fly away from Germany on that day in December and continue bombing, you may take a different view of Franz Stigler's actions.<br />The book is definitely worth reading and it is thought provoking but it should be read with an open mind. It clearly shows that there are good men who get put into bad situations by forces beyond their control but it is unfair to conclude that allowing an enemy to walk away from a battle is a chivalrous act just because that same enemy says that it was.

B00BYOEZTI|5.0|This met my expectations.  Beautiful motion picture.  Lots of gentle humor and fun adventure.  All of the fantastical characters we expect did show up, came alive and captivated me.  I'll watch this one again and again.
B00A83075M|4.0|Despite being somewhat derivative, and having underdeveloped settings and characters, Wreck-It Ralph ranks as a respectably entertaining second-tier Disney animated film. Wreck-It Ralph is not as compelling as Tangled, but considerably more so than Meet the Robinsons.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Okay most of the people may be miserable through the movie, but it is a love story that is brilliantly done. And I love singing which is just a bonus.
B00947N6D8|2.0|I suppose I could tolerate a sword wielding Santa Claus, a miltant kangaroo-like Easter Bunny, and a fairly dull tooth fairy for the sake of a really good story. Unfortunately, the story is very thin, and the theme is uninspiring. On the good side, the animation is superb, there's plenty of action, Jack Frost is fairly likeable, and the concept is very creative. Overall, I didn't really care for the movie, and I don't believe my three-year-old grandchild would like it (were she given the chance).
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|This movie has action, romance and some comedy. It is cool to see a little guy become a hero. And Chris Evans is hot!
1449410243|4.0|I've been reading the Oatmeal for a while.  Some of this seemed familiar, which is OK.  I don't mind giving the author a bit of my money, and now others who have never heard of him can read his work.  The book is well printed and bound, but the removable poster is anything but removable (at least in one piece).<br /><br />Perhaps that part was designed by a cat?
B001HBWY8M|4.0|It is a great romantic comedy. The perfect chick flick! And Colin Firth is in it, and he's awesome. Amanda Bynes is hilarious!! You'll love it!
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|that captures the fun, spirit, and randomness of the original.  I was also surprised at how original the aliens are, how well the time travel element works, and the chemistry of the younger agent K.  This is popcorn entertainment giving the folks exactly what they came to see and anybody who is too much of a snob to suspend their disbelief and just go along with the ride should stop watching so many academy award nominees and crusty old foreign films.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I was surprised little and much they fit into this movie. The book is phenomenal! And they do quite a good job with this first part.
B009AMANBA|4.0|and introduction of key players, as well as the weary mood the country was in after so many years of brutal war losses.  I do resent the usual Spielberg approach of weepy swells of music that try to dictate the audience's emotions.  I also question the need for such a long running time for basically one month in Lincoln's life.  However, the acting, sets, costumes, and subject itself are too interesting to give less than 4 stars.
B001BNFR6W|1.0|I have ordered this three times.  I am in the process of returning the third time order.  Every time they have sent it to me it has multiple defects and dvds that would not play and were defective.  It has been a waste of my time!
B00BF11STU|3.0|One day books will be written that much of this is total fabrication.  One lone young female CIA interrogator obsesses over a mythical courier years after all other agents forgot it.  A rich nightclub playboy in Kuwait gives up the courier's cell # in exchange for a $400,000 Lamborghini.  I respect Navy Seals but the mission as shown seems way too much like a video game.  My theory is Bin Laden ran out of bribe money so the Pakis sold him out.

B003UESJEM|4.0|I'm glad these characters could not be pitied like new MBA's with no savings AND huge student loans.  What kind of executive lives in a million dollar house and can't pay even two months' worth of bills?  Another is pushing 60 and appears to have no  savings.  Yet another is over 65 and financially secure but too industrious to sit still.  I wish it had been brave enough to end without wrapping their fates up so precisely.  In real life today, things seldom end up so black and white.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|love this game! everyone can play &amp; nobody looses! it's fun to breed your dragons &amp; find out what. you get. if you don't visit often its ok; nothing dies!
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Animation is at it's best showing worlds, objects, and action that cannot be realized any other way.  Anybody who was obsessed with video games as a kid will like this movie.  The characters are reasonably interesting and the plot is a good enough excuse to show us a variety of environments.  Minus one star because Q-bert was completely wasted.  I would have instantly bought a DVD titled \\"Ralph and Q-bert Save Candyland\\" or even \\"Q-bert Rescues Sarah Silverman.\\"
