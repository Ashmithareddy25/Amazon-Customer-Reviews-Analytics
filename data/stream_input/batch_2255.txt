1610390938|5.0|After reading this book I could not help but asking why it took sixty years of development research and policy to really start looking closely at the way the poor live, take decisions and react to incentives. It can only have been arrogance to think that our development experience can easily be replicated in the South. Banerjee/Duflo explain convincingly the constraints of the poor, their general insecurity and uncertainty and their - not always rational - ways of reacting to personal emergencies and outside incentives.  I found it quite sobering when the authors point out that the poor have to take conscious decisions where we can rely on a functioning system that takes decisions for us, be it with regard to putting chlorine into your drinking water, saving for retirement, sending your children to school. And what if the government in your country is not willing or able to provide these services and you are not educated enough to make best use of them? The authors do not have easy recipes for remedying the current approach to development but they instill a sense of the daunting task that development presents and the uncertainty if and when it can be achieved. This is an extremely important while eminently readable book. I recommend it very much.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This game is great fun for those who like hidden picture games.  The quality is similar to other G 5 games I have played.  It does take a lot of time to download and it uses a lot of memory on your device.  I would also agree that some of the pictures are hard to see as other reviewers have mentioned but overall it is very entertaining.  I like the story that goes along with it as well.

0393343405|5.0|This book will change the way you think about both the ancient and modern worlds.  Greenblatt is obviously a serious scholar (the end notes are many pages long), but his writing is very accessible.  It reads like a detective novel, especially in the beginning, then eases into some heavy-duty philosophy, but Greenblatt has a gift for making it very relevant to today's world.  This book truly deserved the Pulitzer Prize.
B00APKIN1I|5.0|When I saw the film I was blown away. The history of Sound City and the musicians who recorded there were the best of the best. I remember as a kid buying these albums and going to my room and playing them as loud as I could. hearing my dad yell Turn That Crap Down!! still rings in my ears. I loved it. and now we have Dave Grohl with his latest creation taking me back to my childhood buying this cd playing it in my house as loud as I can get it(Which is pretty damn loud!) and hearing my daughter screaming at me to turn that Crap Down!!  I just love it. This is a great CD. Thanks Dave for reminding me that Rock and Roll is still alive and well. And that it kicks Ass!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Am such a history nut,,love anything that has to do with Lincoln,, could not put it down,, helped me understand the movie so much more,, very educating
B001MYIXAC|5.0|I like vampire movies, the old Hammer films and all the rest, but this movie had a completely different tone to it. I think the fact that it is not an American movie made it so interesting and set it apart as something new. I won't go into the plot as I don't want to put any spoilers in here, but if you can stand to watch it in it's original language with English sub-titles, you may enjoy it like I did. I did try to watch it in dubbed English and gave up as it seemed to detract from the movie even though I wouldn't have to read sub-titling.

B000068FY0|5.0|There's so much good about this album, one doesn't know where to start.  Easily one of the best prog-rock albums of all time, I can only think of Dark Side Of The Moon eclipsing this.  Breakfast In America sold more, but this is their best.  Each song alternating lead vocals between Rick Davies and Roger Hodgson may have been due to competing egos but it totally worked.  You just can't imagine Rick Davies singing Dreamer or Roger Hodgson singing Bloody Well Right.  The piano gave this album a really unique sound, but all in the service of exceptional songs and melodys.  Man, there is some real drama here.  Meant to be listened to as an album from start to finish.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|It kept my attention  throughout the story.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book Life of Pi.  I would recommend it to my friends.

B0074VTHKM|4.0|I really thought this book was very intriguing. I still wonder what ever happened to Pete Duffy. This book had me feel like I was Theo and I was in the middle of the trial. It was just so good! You must read this series.
B00AFEY354|5.0|I fell in love with the book when it came out all those years ago, and this movie didn't disappoint! I love that Steven Chbosky directed the film, and I don't think they could have casted better actors and actresses. It is the absolute best book to movie adaptation I've ever seen. I love it. Favorite movie, hands down.
B007PS0DTI|4.0|It was a good movie but i wish Scott Speedman would have come back. THe story was very interesting. All in all a good movie to watc when you have nothing else to do.
B00338QENI|5.0|Really enjoyed this book. It's a balance of medical, history, and personal experience. Keeps your attention throughout. Rebecca spent much time making sure of its accuracy and committed to sharing each persons story as if it was her own.
B009VB97EY|4.0|THe story line was not that great and the love story seemed forced and awkward. However the dancing guys made up for that. Like i said this would be a good movie to watch while having a girls night and drinking alot of wine.

B00BBQXQFI|5.0|My girls loved this movie. We watched it twice in the last two days and they have already asked to watch it again.
0062082353|5.0|I listened to the unabridged version of the book as I have most of my \\"reading\\" since I am on the road often.  I have also read many of the 1-star ratings given to this story, and while I respect the fact they are expressing their opinion, I cannot agree with what they are saying about the man, Chris Kyle.<br /><br />Chris Kyle is (was) a hero ... a true hero that has saved many and fought evil without any regard to himself.  He is not perfect (as NO ONE reading this is), but was committed to a cause both on and off the battle field; if we could all have a little bit of Chris' passion.<br /><br />As far as the content goes, my only critique is the frequent use of the \\"F-bomb\\", but I understand the need to capture the true essence and factual nature of the point in time the story was delivering.<br /><br />As far as the story goes, it was fascinating as is many of the SEAL books I have \\"read\\", each story told from a different perspective, yet all have a common thread ... consistency, which validates these stories.  The story briefly takes you through BUD/S and then takes you with Chris from his 1st deployment to his last.  It chronics some the incredible shots he made to include the 2100 yard shot (yes, almost a mile and a quarter) which stands as the record today (to my knowledge).  Contrary to what some were saying in their review about Chris not being humble, he was the first to say this shot had luck involved since the computers didn't register that far ... I say it was all him.  Chris talks about the struggles with holding a family together while fighting the war and at times, placing his needs before theirs.  Chris briefly discusses life after the SEALS and his work with distraught veterans; you may or may not know, Chris was recently killed by one the very same he was trying to help.<br /><br />Chris was a real patriot, the EXACT type of person we want fighting for our Country.  He became a great husband and father and above all else, he became a Christian.  And while there is mention of his successes and medals earned, I do not get a feeling at all of this being a book to thump his chest ... although he has every reason to.<br /><br />If you want a book that reads like a Hollywood script, this is NOT it ... this is real and true, about a real man with real struggles and great accomplishments. About someone that most likely saved someone you or a friend know (6-degrees of separation).<br /><br />Also recommend Fearless and the Lone Survivor if you like reading real stories about real SEALs.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is one of my favorite books. It's a great story, and it's the best book of the trilogy. Would definitely recommend the book and the movie.

B00B1OWEVC|4.0|A lot of people will more than likely pick this up due to the involvement of Trent Reznor. Just know, it's not as &#34;rocking'&#34; as the Nails. It's more along the lines of Trent's soundtrack work (which I find to be fantastic). The album was most definitely intended to be listened to straight through, and what a listen it is! It rarely misses (I just cannot get into to &#34;How Long?&#34;), and it's only become more enjoyable with repeated listenings. If you do choose to purchase it, most definitely use your nicest pair of headphones. There are plenty of little audio goodies hidden in the mix for you to discover.<br /><br />The lack of a 5th star is due primarily to it not being a game changer or an absolute masterpiece, which is my criteria for a 5-star album review nowadays, however Trent and co have made a fine record.

Everyone got it on their tablets or phones and we all were playing. You know how games can get old after a while? Well, this game doesn't, as long as you play with people who actually play this game at least once a day. ;P Also this game make your think. It is like pictionary but over the internet and you are not timed. One last thing...this game is really fun, GET IT NOW OR YOU WILL MISS OUT ON A LOT OF FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! : ) : ) : ) : ) ; )  :-)

044661758X|4.0|The Concrete Blonde by Michael Connelly provides a look into the case that made Harry Bosch famous, which had only been briefly mentioned in previous books. The reason it's being brought up again is because more bodies are showing up, and it looks like Bosch was wrong all those years ago. Connelly weaves an interesting yarn as Bosch has to fight his own doubts and uncertainties even as he battles for justice, truth, his reputation, and possibly even his job. The author proves with this one that he also knows his way around a taut legal thriller as the courtroom scenes spark with tension and verisimilitude.
B001HN6922|3.0|skips a little in one spot.  looks like it was pretty well used.  don't know what else to say about it
0446401307|5.0|The Overlook by Michael Connelly began its life as a 16-part serial for the New York Times Magazine, which could account for its shorter than usual length for a Harry Bosch novel, but despite its slight frame, the story still packs a hefty punch. After two novels where Bosch was without a badge, and two working cold cases, The Overlook puts him back where he was born to be - Robbery Homicide Special - the best of the best chasing the murderers and monsters that Connelly's vision of Hollywood seems to breed. The plot is perfectly paced, and plays cleverly upon post 9/11 paranoia, while also managing to show just how dangerous that paranoia can be.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|I was not expecting to love this movie but I did! My whole family enjoyed this wonderful movie! There is something for everyone!
1455519650|4.0|The Black Ice by Michael Connelly begins with what the reader is told is a relatively common occurrence: a cop's suicide. Respect dictates that the investigation not be dragged out, but LAPD Homicide Detective Harry Bosch is dogged as always. When he finds incongruities and inconsistencies, he pulls on those loose threads until he finds himself plunged into more murder, corruption, and ties to the Mexican drug trade. Connelly doesn't disappoint in this second outing with his signature protagonist; it's a slick narrative that keeps the reader on their toes and guessing all the way to the end.
B006LSZECO|3.0|so I retread it. Of course I recalled it before I got there. So I quit reading.  Would I recommend d it to a friend?  Not really. Was it interesting? Yes.  Spellbinding?  No. One is left with the idea those two do, really do, deserve each other. This is one of those books that one could read if they had already read all the good stuff and nothing else looked interesting.
0440245915|5.0|John Grisham's debut novel, A Time to Kill, grips the reader from the outset with its depiction of the brutal and despicable beating and violation of a young girl. Such is the extreme nature of the incident that it raises the ire and indignation of anyone with a conscience or shred of humanity within them. Grisham then continues on with his narrative - adding interesting characters and plot twists aplenty, but deftly managing to never get on a soapbox to tell the reader just what is right and wrong. Grisham does raise some sticky issues involving race, prejudice, justice, and the potential morality of murder, but what makes this debut so clever is that he never provides any real answers; he just asks the pertinent and provocative questions. Beyond those larger elements, the small town world that Grisham captures feels authentic and lived in, his characters as real as my next door neighbor.

I just couldn't do it until the literal end letter of the book and its not because I should, it's because the situation also made me sad.<br /><br />Wow ... I was blown away with all the different situations and emotions portrayed int his book by more than one character.

B0015DROBO|1.0|Cannot get into the story.  Too many characters and too intense plot.  I wish it were clearer and easier to grasp
B0063GORYU|5.0|A great game if you have nothing else to do. One of those classic games that you can't get sick of.
B00BHMETKC|2.0|OK, I understand the movie is based on a true story, but what happened to the basics of movie making? It is basically a simple movie, told in the most simplistic way. Close ups and fast-paced editing don't let the viewer to understand the movie environment. You don't develop a connection with any of the characters. The final climax is purely laughable and I am not sure if it took place in that fashion in reality. Ben Affleck is his usual self. He doesn't come across as a CIA operative, let alone an exfil. If it wasn't for the historical background, it would be impossible to care for any of the characters based on the movie alone. If you watch the extras on DVD, you will notice that the real story has much more to it. I am disappointed that this movie stole the Oscar from other more deserving movies.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|Being a near 60 year-old, I have been in love with Tolkien's Hobbit and Middle World fantasy for a long time--since my teenage years.  I introduced the Fellowship of the Ring movie to my sons when it first came out and they became big fans too--seeing it repeatedly in the theaters and with great anticipation and a famished appetite, consumed the next two parts of the trilogy when they finally arrived in theaters.  We bought the VCR and DVD versions and would have marathon watching sessions together often.  They introduced it to my grandchildren so the tradition continues.<br /><br />Even though I no longer enjoy going to see many movies in the theater, I decided that I wanted to see the Hobbit with a full screen and sound of a theater.  I even went alone so I would not be distracted by conversation with anyone else.  I was prepared to see the \\"slow parts\\" reviewers warned would be there.  However, I didn't experience any scenes that were slow at all.  It was a story that had me engaged the whole way through as well as having amazing cinematography and other qualities that are best experienced at least once in a theater.  I have come to think that the reviewers lacked the understanding of how good conversation and narrations really give the heart and soul of a good story.  This movie restores that quality to the mix better than any I have seen in decades, including the Lord of the Ring.  Action scenes are there to enhance and illustrate the story more completely, but they should not be the foundation of it. If action and great cinematography is the foundation of the story in a movie, it lacks staying power and is hollow.  This is a movie I will enjoy and get more out of it each time I watch it.  This is a movie of great substance and balance that will also be wonderful to watch at home using any device we have available to see it.  None of the artists who brought us this product were lacking.
B002KT3XH6|5.0|Excellent and well documentated this book gives you an interesting outlook in the lives of the wife's of Henry VIII and of the conditions of women in Tudor times.
0060873175|1.0|I would be most interested to learn where Crichton left off and Preston began. One reviewer says all Crichton wrote was the Introduction. In an NPR interview, Audie Cornish says, \\"Preston got the first part of the book that would be named 'Micro' and a handful of Crichton's notebooks filled with handwritten scrawls.\\"<br /><br />I'm not going to say this is a bad book for the following reasons:<br /><br />1. Preston is a skilled author in his own right; I have a copy of \\"The Wild Trees\\" sitting on my shelf waiting to be read. He may be better known or thought of as a nonfiction author.<br />2. I don't know how much time Preston was given to do his writing. It feels like a first draft. In my own writing, almost all the richness is imbued in revising.<br />3. First draft or no, it needed a damned good copy-edit. There were numerous instances where an editor could have improved it.<br /><br />As others have said, it's a dull read, and the characters are [tiny] stick figures. It's too long. It reads like a very young YA novel, like maybe for a 10- or 11-year-old.<br /><br />\\"Micro\\" is kind of schizophrenic. On the one hand it's a techno-thriller, and on the other it's a naturalist-science-adventure novel. The techno-thriller aspect could have been accomplished without shrinking the kids, honey. I knew Eric would reappear, and I knew Vin would get his due in the end. The naturalist-science theme could have been explored in a separate novel without relying on the techno-thriller story line. Together, IMO, the two themes do not create a congruent plot.<br /><br />For a novel in this genre, \\"Micro\\" is one of the most fatuous I've ever read. I'm still scratching my head, wondering why I finished it. The book did have one virtue: if I picked it up at bedtime, I fell asleep within a few pages.<br /><br />Mr. Preston, I hope you have been inspired to write a new novel of your own.

B0073LWEXK|5.0|i love this app i  think everyone should get this app because you have to figure out puzzles and change stuff it can get fusterating at times but thats normal
B00B7Y0206|4.0|I downloaded this software because my kindle was not handling YouTube video's correctly.<br />This software works.  It has a search feature, and it categorizes the videos pretty well.<br />My only complaint is that they want me to provide register and provide them with my email address.  I'm reluctant to do that - I don't want any more spam!
B00746O3X8|4.0|This is a good product and held up well during a six week excursion tramping in New Zealand. The double-safety harness saved my Nikon D7K on numerous occasions and traveling hands-free allowed me the flexibility to use my hands for climbing and other activities.<br /><br />The harness did not stay tight across my chest and needed to be tightened on occasion which was an awkward process. The system works best when tightly secured and the design of the Velcro strap that ensures fitness is not the best.<br /><br />Aside from my issues with the harness belt loosening, the device is well-made, quite sturdy and I never felt the camera would disengage from the holster. Further, I never had any neck or shoulder discomfort, even after wearing the product for 12/hours a day.<br /><br />I did not have the opportunity to use the holster.
B00A23MYCC|5.0|I really enjoy any film mark walberg does! This movie was one of the first in a long time that had me laughing out loud many times in the theater and I wasn't the only one laughing like so!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I was very happy to order this item and have it in my possession within a week.  It is a nice cable that plugs into the separate plug for charging the Kindle Fire.  It has not disappointed me!
B00ADS98FC|4.0|Great sound track to the movie including the mixes. I enjoyed the story line! I aso really enjoy the singing!
0812982622|4.0|I'm kidding.  But holy buttons, that country is batty.<br /><br />This book, though.  Man.  It's terrific.  And it got me thinking about the integrity of a well-defined character, and how that compares to the memory (first-hand or otherwise) of a real person.  When regarding popular and beloved fictional people, Harry Potter for example, one feels like he knows that character.  He responds with approval when Harry does exactly the sort of noble, self-sacrificing thing someone as heroic as Harry would do, and he responds with measured indignation when Harry is written to behave in a way that seems out of sorts, or unfamiliar.  One knows Harry because he's applied his own ideas and emotions on to Rowling's creation.<br /><br />But consider Elvis Presley.  Did you meet him?  I didn't.  He died in 1977.  On the toilet or not, he is no more.  But he was an actual person, who actually lived.  But I have no idea who he was.  I don't know what he was like in the company of friends, or if he really had any at all.  Did he enjoy his wealth?  Was he burdened by fame?  What was he afraid of?  I have no idea.  I don't care, either, but that's neither here nor there.  Elvis was real and Harry is not, but Harry exists more vividly in my mind.  And since perception is reality, does that mean that a fictional character is more real than a stranger?<br /><br />Anyway, this book made me think of that.
B00884GR0W|1.0|block story is boring. all you do is take away blocks and put new ones in. the point of the game is to take away all the blocks. before it blows up. I do not know why. there are do many 5 star reviews.
B0000042MY|3.0|This CD was purchased for someone else and since I did nt listen to it, I cannot comment further on it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I saw my cousin playing flow on her iPad. After patiently waiting for her to tire of it, she finally took a break and that is when I thought I would give it a try. I quickly earned that I would have to download the app or my cousin would never see her iPad again. I like this game because your mind is always working. It definitely teaches you to \\" think outside of the box\\". Definitely great exercise to keep the mind sharp!!
B006ISJQ1W|3.0|Despite featuring a fascinating time and location, this movie failed me for several reasons. Namely: that Depp was far too old for the role. His love for Thompson is evident, and his acting chops allow him to portray all the necessary emotions. But while Depp's wide-eyed naivete and self-centered recklessness might be understandable coming from a twenty something, the behavior felt awkward and pathetic in a man nearly 50. Eckhart is perfectly cast, and actually, Amber Heard is too. I imagine if we somehow inserted a Johnny Depp circa 1990, he would have been perfect as well.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|Don't listen to the smattering of negative reviews - this movie is no less than EPIC.  Experienced it in theaters and I pre-ordered the digital version today.  A must-have for any digital or disc library - this movie is perfection - Hollywood at its very best.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|We have several of these and continue to buy them for family members.  Great for new babies to keep the nuk in by just setting the animal on a blanket.  Great for toddlers because they put their own nuk in.  Easy clean, just throw in the washer and dryer.  Once there cracked just cut off the nuk and you have a toy still.  Win, Win.

B00899E7VM|5.0|I've been waiting to see if they would release the concert in some fashion. I saw these superstars of Fusion Jazz a couple of years ago at the Mann Music Center in Philadelphia, PA. To add to the experience, was the fact that they had 'Zappa Plays Zappa' as an opening act. Two great shows for the price of one in my opinion. I am currently writing this while I'm jamming to the album on my home theater system and yes, I have the volume cranked up.<br /><br />Saw Chick, Stanley and Lenny a year or two before this show at the Zoellner Arts Center at the Lehigh University in the Allentown / Bethlehem area and was blown away at how much music came from a grand piano, an upright bass and a trap set drum setup. These guys had the hall swaying to their tunes. Didn't get a chance to meet them at this event, so when they came to Philly, I decided to up my experience by buying a pre-autographed drum head. This purchase gave me access to the back stage after the show. Such a wonderful trio to be around in person. So down to earth. I didn't think that someone of Stanley Clarke's stature could be so nimble on a bass guitar, man is he tall. Unfortunately, Jean-Luc Ponty and Frank Gambale declined to be part of the after show meet, but I was able to get their autograph on the drum head as well through the back stage rep.<br /><br />Just listening to the music with my eyes closed, I can still picture what I saw of their performance. For anyone interested in Jazz at its finest, you need to get this album. These fine gentlemen aren't getting any younger and who knows how much more they can keep up the music.<br /><br />Did get a laugh during the concert when Chick was talking about how much he and Jean-luc have played on each others albums over the years, but only in studio settings. Chick said that this was the first time in 40 years that they have played a live show together. Well worth the money spent, for the shows and the album. Highly recommended.
B00992CF6W|5.0|best game ever but they should get rid of herobrine and Pc and xbox r more uptated then pocket adishion but this is a.good start to see if u.like mineceaft...I know I do!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I'm not sure whether it is the amazing scenes (&#34;every frame a cameo&#34;), people trying their best to address issues with style and courtesy, or the great characters, but I love this show. It is well written, well produced, well directed, and the actors are outstanding. Little in the way of John Wayne style action, but everything else is there and more. Quiet, beautifully composed, and satisfying to watch.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|a decent app game but i am having alot of issues with lag, dont know if anyone else is having problems
B002VECM6S|5.0|Every person should see this show !  It's a wonderful story.<br />I love how it shows &#34;people-helping-people&#34;.<br />This is how it should be.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Well written, very well researched, very entertaining!!  A real science fiction book that is as much about the science as it is about the fiction.

B00BJA2VFW|5.0|It is challenging from the beginning.  I've been playing non stop for over an hour on my kindle hd and havinga blast.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this show!! It's one of my favorite escapes from the day! I like the story, love the characters (and hate some), and look forward to watching it. However, this isn't something i can watch and watch until the season is over. I watch one a day, maybe every other day. It's still a good show!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Great book. All of the witchy/sci-fi stuff I love without being incessantly juvenile. I can't wait to buy the next in the series.
B000002HNR|5.0|I began listening to The Doors when I was 5 years old.  Though this is not the original black and royal blue album cover, the music is the same as was in that album.  The Doors are the greatest rock band ever.  They give any composition a run for the money including classical treats like Mozart and Led Zeppelin.  Their composition is genius.
1604680547|5.0|Love this book, came a few days after ordering and everything I want for learning and doing appliqué.  Saw it when a friend shared it and had to have it.  Can use it for both quilting and appliqué.  Bought one for a friend

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I was looking for an affordable gaming mouse with good features, the Anker High Precision Laser Gaming mouse exceeded my expectations.  The multiple profiles are great, I use one for browsing and the other for FPS.  I change the DPI often based what I am doing and love the ability to change it on the fly the Anker provide.  This really has the features and feel of a much more expensive mouse at a bargain price.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|High action movie, with a reality check in stores for everybody, I love that is a true story, and well made. I now see what was the whole buzz of Affleck not being nominated for a oscar for best director, the movie is so well made and put together! Great movie!
B00B23O96A|5.0|If you are looking for a hit or you just love Clapton for &#34;Wonderful Tonight&#34; or &#34;Tears in Heaven&#34; or &#34;Change the World&#34;, you came to the wrong place.  This is Clapton being Clapton - playing the guitar - and choosing songs to play what he loves.  For many years now, he has played for the sake of paying homage to those he has respected over the years (clearly he doesn't need fame and/or fortune).  This album does just that - and it does it well.  Though standards are not everyone's taste, when they are done by Eric Clapton, they take on a new flare - bravado - if you will.  If you love Clapton for who he is and/or you love music and/or great musicians, this is for you.<br /><br />I can also tell you that, &#34;Goodnight Irene&#34; live is AMAZING - I also had the privilege of seeing the 50th anniversary tour opening night in Phoenix.  That set list will please any Clapton fan!
0440237688|3.0|Although completely lacking the sex and violence that today's children seem to deserve, Lois Lowry is able to deliver a well-paced and well-wrought psychological thriller. As an adult I have to admit that I was a little less than engrossed in the plot. With an effective absence of character motivations and an oppressive monotony of language the very elements that make The Giver successful also keep it from being an honestly fulfilling read for an adult. Everything that I've seen in every previous version (from Utopia to A Scanner Darkly) might come across as a lot more novel to a teen readers. In fact, the book would make a great companion piece to such serious literature especially if combined with the lens of Marxism. Compared to the Hunger Games, though, The Giver is not nearly as gripping nor as impacting. The poorly-rendered fantasy science of the Sameness, the reception of memory by blue-eyed people (racist?) and the Truman Show vibe of the Outside all feel like cardboard reconstructions of other, better stories. Although the Hunger Games novels are horribly-written Collins can at least stand behind her talent for genre mash-ups as opposed to Lowry's genre mining. The real tragedy here is that authors at both ends of the Child-Adult spectrum prefer a smaller, more precise readership. Gone are the days of Watership Down and The Little Prince. Now we have Gravity's Rainbow and Harry Potter. Is anyone concerned about cross-generation discourse?

B000H6SXMY|4.0|I was in my early teens when this show came out so I never really related to it or got into it when it was in first-run TV--and for a while as an adult I couldn't stand it--but I admit this show is growing on me.<br /><br />I got this entire series as a gift, and a set of Seinfeld seasons, too, and I love the Friends DVDs but just can't get into Seinfeld. I don't know if the humor is just over my head with Seinfeld, but Friends is just low-pressure, easy comedy and I really enjoy it.<br /><br />It's actually most enjoyable to me as a background noise type thing, while I cook in the kitchen or sew.<br /><br />Awesome fun!<br /><br />Ross is by far my favorite, second place Chandler.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Our boys are 12 and 14 years old.

0385349947|5.0|Lean In addresses multiple discomforts that women within the workplace and at-home endure. Intended to empower and spark a dialogue, which will ultimately lead to change, Sheryl Sandberg incorporates several vignettes where she has felt belittled and also empowered.<br /><br />Pulling from a variety of research studies and books-- Sandberg builds a compelling and sound case on why women should strive to reach their full potential on EQUAL ground. She champions and respects the decisions that all women make: working professionals and Stay-at-home mothers, revealing both choices take a considerable amount of effort and dedication.<br /><br />Lean In is the appetizer of where change can build. It's not written to provide the end solution( we're only capable of providing that). It's primarily written to GIVE women a fighting chance to realize their full potential within the workplace, home or both. It encourages men, partners, spouses and companies to join the conversation, acknowledging that in order for real change to occur-- we need to start having conversations that can amend policies, dynamics and roles to push toward a more equal world.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|A gamer I am not so this game is for me. It is fun, the graphics are great/beautiful. It is great for kids on a long trip or in a long wait, love it, keeps them busy, when I play it helps pass the time.
B00AAQHP66|3.0|I love watching movies based on true stories, and this one didn't disappoint.<br />It was inspiring watching a man learn how to become a better man, through his actions pertaining to a neighborhood boy. This boy, who is fatherless, becomes Gerards' prodigy. He teaches him more than just surfing, he really becomes a surrogate father of sorts.<br />The movie definitely has what I call, \\"The Disney Effect\\". Things are slightly predictable and everyone gets what they want in the end, with a happy one at that, of course.<br />Not a movie I would watch with little ones, but tweens and teens will enjoy it surely.
0767817478|4.0|I understand all the moaning about how the makers of this film ripped \\"Alien\\" off for one part of this film but, come on, Godzilla never looked better than he does here, even in Japanese films made years after this one. He no longer plods along, obviously a man in a clunky suit. He looks like a real, very believable dinosaur in this. My favorite scenes are those in which the old boy is chased by helicopters through the streets of New York. He steps on buildings, jumps through them and makes for a very realistic monster reeking havoc in a real modern metropolis. Those scenes are great!<br /><br />I also thought the destruction of the Chryslar Building was really well done.<br /><br />It was fun to see two of the voice-over stars from \\"The Simpsons\\" as main characters as well.<br /><br />I suggest you get over being so picky and view the film as an overall picture, and a very entertaining one with great special effects ta boot!
B0000DZTIW|5.0|CD came to me in great condition and has been working ever since. Great listening music and no problems with any of the music tracks. CD came to me the date that it was promised.
0765325950|3.0|What a crushing disappointment. I can confidently say I did not wait two decades for this book.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. Sanderson's writing was phenomenal. This book reads nothing like any other book in the series, but it works. I am inclined to read something by Sanderson all the more for what he accomplished here. It's the last book, the time for Jordan's brilliant character development is over. It is time for action. This was a page turner with the proper pacing for the Last Battle. The build up of hopelessness and the attempts of the Light to persevere, exactly what was called for. If it wasn't for the writing I would have gone with two stars, but I wanted to recognize the work that went into this and how challenging it would be to finish what Jordan started.<br /><br />...but when I finish and good book, and especially a good series, I expect an emotional connection. I am saying good bye to friends that I will likely never meet again. At the very least I expect to feel this. Unfortunately I don't have this. Characters and events from the first two books are resolved in mere paragraphs. And while there are some prophecies that should be surprising and unable to predict, it feels like a few keys ones were just thrown in at the last minute. Considering the detail and time spent on Alivia's prophecy, to cover this in one sentence. I get it, the prophecy is fulfilled. I guess everyone else forgot all about it what with the Last Battle and all (which is actually pretty plausible, just disappointing that something that received pages of attention is reduced to one line of text). And Min's viewing for Bryne and Siuan? Technically kept to the fact she always see's the truth, but don't characters from the very start of the series deserve more respect than this? Would it really derail the story telling to give dedicated readers a chance to be with these characters at their final moments?<br /><br />I don't know if Sanderson followed Jordan's notes and I am just unsatisfied. I don't know if Sanderson failed to achieve Jordan's vision. I don't know if I am so shell shocked that I have not recovered from the horrors of war. The book did reach me, but I am feeling numb. Having read the first book nearly a dozen times, I am not sure I will ever read it again. Hopefully in a few years I can approach the series once more and finally be at peace.
B004PGO25O|4.0|A truth telling, encouraging book, - challenges the reader to stay with the stuff and finish ... and begin again!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Visually stunning with heartfelt lows and highs the audience can revel in along with the characters.  It is a rare film that you can call \\"art\\" but this one qualifies.  The story is amazingly engaging, so much so that I couldn't believe the end was upon me so soon by the conclusion.  This is a testament to the original author but also the adaptation.  As I mentioned the directing and visuals were pure eye candy, yet so tastefully and expertly done that they serve to pull you into the story rather than distract you from it.  Toss in some deep revelations that will leave you in self reflection long after the credits role and you have a modern day masterpiece that is very hard to come by these ADD days and harder to just walk away from when the screen finally goes black.<br /><br />This movie is pretty unique but just to compare the \\"feel\\" of it to some others you may have seen to give a general idea of whether it will fit your viewing mood at the moment: take 3 parts Cast Away, mix with 1 part Big Fish, add a dash of We Bought a Zoo and just a pinch of Hugo and mix thoroughly on the high seas.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is the first time I have ever left a review, but I felt like I had to share how much I enjoyed Wool 1-5.<br /><br />The setting is unique and I would actually consider it a character in its own right.  Hugh Howey has a done a wonderful job in writing this saga full of mystery, suspense, love, compassion, despair, and triumph.<br /><br />I would definitely advise that a new reader buys the Wool Omnibus.  But if you are unsure, just buy Wool #1 and you will be hooked.

B0063GORYU|5.0|Any fan of solitaire will love this.  Add a suite or three for more of a challenge.  It is addictive!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book, could not put it down. Many twists and turns. First believing what the people of silo are told is a lie, then you start to think maybe it isn't a lie, but finally realizing it is a lie, just a different far bigger than you first are led to believe. I intentionally am being vague as to not give too much away, I dislike reviews that provide too much detail.<br /><br />I like how it's not strictly from one characters perspective and how each in turn unravels part of the deceit. The author does a good job of not spoon feeding information to the reader as some are prone to doing. It has a very natural progression to it.<br /><br />The characters are developed and likable, or in the case of the bad guys not likable. The plot is carried out successfully and even something that could potentially happen.<br /><br />This book I recommend to those who enjoy a 'who done it' mixed with post World War III/apocalyptic novel. The author stated he will write more novels related to this series which I look forward to reading. My only disappointment was in finishing merely since I desire for the story to continue.

As consummate professionals, they make their reproductions sound exactly like the songs you bought on all those Eagles albums.  It is eerie how good these guys are at what they do.  Marvelous words, great musicians...its just uncanny..<br />I have the SD version of this concert as well, and, I must say, the Blu Ray DOES look superior...it is worth the money.<br />As with all Eagles products, the sound mixing is AWESOME!!!<br />Do not hesitate to make yourself happy...buy this thing...

B008D4AKYQ|5.0|Once upon a time, in a musical galaxy far, far away, there was a  movement afoot to shake up the rock music form. It was an exciting time  of experimentation, when it was desirable, even cool, to not try to  sound like everyone else. A time when going to London meant coming home  with bell bottomed loon pants, poofy shirts and velvet blazers. Of  musical exploration, sonic advances, long winded solos and lyrics  destined to implode from the weight of their own pretense. Yes, it was  an exciting time in rock, when English rich kid art school dropouts  groped towards a new sound, drawing heavily on classical, supernatural,  spaced out themes to create music their generation could do good drugs  by. For those who had outgrown their Beatle records and hadn't yet  become drug addled alcoholics, this music was a godsend, a Pandora's box   of imaginative, creative output that enthralled the rock music world  for a brief period in the early 70's. This boundary pushing, evolving  genre even had a high-minded dopey name attached to it - for lack of a  better term, they called it \\"Progressive Rock\\". But inevitably, like all   musical trends, the Progressive Rock era peaked, ultimately becoming a  victim of it's own excess, milked and cheesed up for all it was worth by   the business that grew around it like a giant hogweed until it was  thrown out on it's pompous ass by punk rock. This form exists to this  day, and while flying under the radar in the wasteland of today's pop  music, even the name \\"progressive rock\\" has been dumbed down for today's   attention span to \\"prog rock\\". And the only thing more annoying than  the term \\"prog rock\\" are the bands of today's \\"prog rock\\" genre who  think tricky time signatures and histrionic noodling to display  pointless technological prowess are what Progressive rock was about.  O.K., so where's the review?    Fast forward to 2012, and roaring quietly down the tracks come Big  Big Train, their own history dating back to the early 90's, with their  masterpiece \\"English Electric, Pt 1\\". Foregoing bombast and smarty pants   arranging, this band actually \\"gets\\" it, and seem to have a deep  respect and knowledge of what made this music so engaging in the first  place.  Without relying on the latest techno toys in order to sound  \\"different\\" and \\"proggy\\", they have created a record that hits you like  the first time you heard \\"Foxtrot\\". Conventional rock instrumentation,  gtr., bass, drums, vintage synths and mellotrons augmented by flute,  woodwinds, brass, violins, cello, and banjo, this band relies on good  old fashioned songwriting, arranging, and imagination to create songs  and suites that hark back to the best of what this genre has to offer in   a compelling, fresh way without sounding dated or tributary. Sure, you  hear elements of Gabriel-era Genesis, Yes, PFM, even \\"Lizard\\" era  Crimson, but without sounding borrowed or referential, it's more like  just a continuation of music of that era that draws you in and captures  the imagination of those with jaded ears in a true and fresh sounding  way. From the first moments of \\"The First Rebreather\\" you sense this is  something special from writers and musicians with a reverence for the  past and ears in the now. Multi-instrumentalist and lead singer David  Longdon immediately strikes one as a cross between Gabriel and PFM's  Bernardo Lanzetti with a genuine passion and timbre all his own. Ex-XTC  guitarist David Gregory may suggest Howe or Hackett, but never comes off   as emulative, with fills of tasteful restraint and leads of fiery and  appropriate invention. Drummer Nick D'Virgilio (Spock's Beard) plays  with a suitable inventiveness as exciting as Collins on \\"Foxtrot\\" or  \\"Selling England\\" without trying to be Collins. For these songs truly  are an extension over a void in time in music that fans of this genre  miss, that time has forgotten, and that today's \\"prog\\" bands miss the  point of.    Songs ebb, flow, and explode with melody, phrasing,musicality and  dynamic arranging that gracefully traverse pastoral and majestic peaks  and valleys as in the beauty of  \\"Winchester From St. Giles Hill\\". \\"Judas Unrepentant\\" exemplifies the  best of accessible keyboard arranging and interplay with   impassioned vocal arranging and delivery. \\"Uncle Jack Knows\\" is playful   and infectious, with it's background vocal brilliantly reprised on album closer \\"Hedgerow\\". \\"Summoned By Bells\\" is stunningly smart with a lovely and soothing  extended coda that just sets you adrift.    And so it is with each and every song on \\"English Electric Pt. 1\\".  \\"English Electric Pt. 2\\" was released early 2013, and as with \\"The  Underfall Yard\\" of 2009, this is a singular band that reveres the best  of the melodic songwriting of those that came before, but reaffirm it's  grandeur in humble and original execution. A reassuring and brave  triumph that defies trends and succeeds on their own terms in ways long  forgotten or relegated to quaint nostalgia, and a breath of fresh air in   such musically superficial times.
B002VECM6S|4.0|I absolutely LOVE this movie, but I felt cheated with the copy of the DVD I purchased.  They had cut some very good scenes that has some significant links to the story and put them into the \\"Deleted Scenes\\" section of the menu.  The majority of these scenes were in the original movie when it was first released and also in the TV aired version.  It still gets the point across, but not as solidly as the original version. Those of us who have seen the movie previously will miss the scenes and those who haven't will miss out on the deeper meaning to the story line.
B008DL466C|2.0|PRODUCTION: 4/8<br />LYRICS: 4/8<br />CONTENT: 4/8<br />ENJOYMENT: 4/8<br /><br />O.N.I.F.C. is a boring album with a repetitive sound and irrelevant content, Wiz Khalifa does nothing to heighten the enjoyment as his flow and delivery is lazy and uninteresting.  The production consists of a laid back and chill vibe with a slow bpm.  The sound is very cohesive and it transitions well but the tracks come off repetitive and not attention grabbing; only the Neptune's track catches the ear.  Wiz Khalifa delivers a decent but rather lazy performance, literally talking about that same ol' jazz: marijuana, money, lavish living.  There is a little bit of meaning but that is essentially muffled by the excessive irrelevance.  Boring and uninteresting.
B00932DCS8|5.0|The movie draws the viewer in somewhat slowly and then ups the tempo dramatically to the very end.  You finally get to relax at the conclusion of the movie at marvel at the &#34;wrap up.&#34;
B000W93CXQ|4.0|A very sad book, but a happy ending. It gives you a reality check about suicide. I thought it was a nice book.
B0097HSS4M|1.0|I was wondering if there was a way to combine pictures obtained already in the gallery or something like combining pictures that could be done?
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|The movie was done very well. I laughed and cried. This will be one of the movies I wear out from watching too many times.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|I will always remember the first time I saw this.  Too me, I didn't think movies could get any better.  It was, still, and always will be an amazing film.  THe sequels aren't bad, but not in same realm of greatness as the the first one.  They were still worth buying though.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Season 2 of Downton Abbey carries the story line through the first world war.  It is beautiful to watch.  The performers and the production values are the best.  As the story takes the servants and family members through the war and the changes it brings to their lives it keeps the viewer completely engrossed.
B0025VLELQ|3.0|I grew up in a family of sic-fi fanatics, this is one of our favorites.  Video games and aliens, what could be better for any sic-fi fan?
B004LWZWGK|5.0|If only this was in 3D!!! What a bummer. Way too Awwwwweeeeessssssoooooommmmmeeee of a film to leave that only to theaters! My Kids were bummed too, but loved every minute of the film, minus a few covering of the eyes & explanations to what was wrong in real life & why, lol. This definitely exceeded my expectations... I just wasn't sure if they could pull it off without Heath Ledger as the Joker, but they did it! Bane kicked butt & awesome twist at the end! My daughter loved bat girl; Anne Hathaway owned that part! Five Stars all around, amazing special effects, kept me on the edge of my seat like last time! :)
B00BHU2A7I|3.0|Aa a big fan of Hitchcock, I was really looking forward to this.  While not bad, it wasn't great either.
B00A85EMVK|5.0|My title says it all. Amazing how they added 3D Blu-Ray clearer definition without compromising the foundation of the film's original 80's genre & culture. Highly recommended! :)
B009JBZH54|4.0|I absolutely loved these movies.  In an age of cheesy superhero movies, these ones stood above the rest as the best.
B002QS5OQ4|5.0|I never watched much of the other Stargate series, I just couldn't get into it (even with Richard Dean Anderson) but SGU was on TV late one night and it really captured my interest.  I watched most of the episodes but it was hard to catch it on TV as late as it was on. I really like Robert Carlyle (Gold, on the TV series Once Upon A Time) and I recognized many of the other actors from other things I've watched.  David Blue, who plays Eli, was Logan (the computer expert) on Moonlight.  He was a very memorable character in that show so it was great to see him in this. Ming-Na Wen is also a strong character in this series and you might remember her from some episodes of Two and a Half Men as one of Charlie's love interests and also from ER as Dr. Deb Chen.  I'm sure you will recognize some of the other actors too. There are only 2 seasons to this series and I think they're worth buying.

B000RZGIOA|4.0|Back when Cage and Travolta still did good movies, it couldn't get any better then this one.  An action classic!
0307887960|5.0|This is the critical piece to the the weight loss process. Pierre Dukan has really figured out what folks need after they have lost the weight. He sets out two more steps after the weight loss period to help your body stabilize at the new weight and to teach you how to eat regular meals. Didn&#34;t think I could do this program, but am into week five and feeling good about the weight loss and more importantly the change to wholesome foods, no commercial products etc.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|I absolutely love this show.  Almost every person I talk too I tell them about this show.  I don't know how many people I've gotten hooked on it.
B008Y7G6UO|4.0|I remember watching this when I was younger and have been looking for it since. I liked the story line and had forgotten some things so I was glad that I found it again.
B000GPIPD8|3.0|I'm a big Black Keys fan, while this album is good, it doesn't compare to some of their other work.
0316017930|5.0|Outstanding book for a high school student or above.  Our MBA professor used some chapters from this book in our class; which was the first time I've read Gladwell; wished I would have had this class 20 years ago.  By the book, and then by one for a friend.
B007IQX1G4|4.0|Jason Reitman is ana amazing director!  By my count, he is four for four in making great films.  I highly recommend this to movie lovers.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|\\"My dear Frodo, you asked me once if I had told you everything there was to know about my adventures. Well, I can honestly say I've told you the truth, I may not have told you all of it.\\" Bilbo Baggins (Freeman) is living his life quiet and alone, just like he likes when one day a wizard named Gandolf (Mckellen) shows up with an offer to join him and his group of dwarfs on an adventure. His reluctance finally gives way and he sets out on an adventure that will change his life forever. I have to be honest and admit that I was not a fan of the Lord Of The Rings movies. I thought the first one was boring. The second one to me was a bad remake of Army Of Darkness (I know, go ahead and judge). I did think the third one was OK but not worthy of best picture. All that said I was not looking forward to watching this one. I open with that to say that I actually enjoyed this one. There was actually action in this and not as much constant walking. I know this is a movie people will either see or not see no matter what reviews say but as a person who did not like the original Lord Of The Rings trilogy I did like this one, I hope that helps in your decision. Overall, to me this was better then all three of the other movies. I give it a B+.
B008COII1Y|1.0|I was forced to watch this against my wishes and it lived up to my expectations.  It was horrible and torture!
B008220D7S|4.0|\\"The happiest period in people's lives in from age 40 -60, so this is it we're in it right now.\\" Pete (Rudd) and Debbie (Mann) have finally reached the milestone of 40. Pete is OK with it, Debbie is not. They are constantly fighting and so are their daughters. When Pete's dream job isn't working out like he expected and Debbie finds out an employee is stealing from her the tensions start to increase. When something unexpected happens they begin to question if they should still be together. First of all let me say that this movie has nothing to do with Knocked Up at all except for Pete and Debbie and the kids. That's it so DO NOT expect a full on sequel. That being said I really did love this movie. In my opinion Judd Apatow is the modern day John Hughes. Starting with 40 Year Old Virgin he showed that movies can be both side splitting funny and real and full of heart. This movie had more of the feel that Funny People had in the way that it is really funny in parts but also very very real which to me makes it better. On a personal note most of the things the couple did and said reminded me of me and my wife, which added to the enjoyment and made it that much funnier. This is a very funny grown-up comedy that I highly recommend. Overall, a very funny movie that married couples will highly enjoy. I give it an A.
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|Only reason I saw this was because I like to see all the oscar nominated films before the awards.  This one didn't impress.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I really wish there were more games out there like this one! I couldn't seem to put it down...I highly recommend it to anyone who likes mystery and hidden object games
B0068THAGY|3.0|I didn't know what to expect from this movie, but it was better then I expected it to be and then more.
B001AEF6C2|4.0|This movie is very funny. What guy hasn't thought of what his perfect girl would be like? This movie is about every boys fantasy.
B00542USJW|3.0|If I had seen this movie for the first time know, I probably wouldn't like it. But it comes with a lot of childhood memories.
B0000C9ZBW|5.0|I'm sorry that I lost this package and already tell UPS. I know this product will be good, that's why I give five stars.
B000WQWPKA|3.0|I know now this doesn't hold the same respect it did in the mid 90s, but I remember when this came out, it was the best movie ever made.  Now a guilty pleasure!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I recommend to every body I rated 5 star  it is  very good  I watched every day it is very convenient  the weather channel for
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Movie wasn't bad, but it wasnt the best bond movie they've made.  Still waiting for the first Daniel Craig Bond movie to blow me away!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It kept me on the edge of my chair<br />And I couldn't put it away not for a single second
B001KVZ6HK|3.0|I prefer darker super hero movies like The DArk Knight Trilogy, but this one was very good and I really enjoyed it.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I really like that there are so many different fazes of the game. If I want to change there are so many to choose from.
1582701709|5.0|This book changed my life.  It teachers us to see the positive in all situatins and that you can change your life every day in little ways. Everyone should read this one! Makes a great gift for someone who in in a life change or who just need some uplifting.
0385537816|5.0|Books cam shipped really well I have not have had much time to finish reading these, because I am a full time college student, but I look forward to finishing them in the summer time. The price for them was great for all three.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|So good. Loved the fact that it was told from the dog's point of view.  It made it even more interesting.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This clock has a good alarm and wakes people up.  It also shows the weather.  I recommend it.  Download this app if you need an alarm.
0345803507|5.0|I can understand how some folks give E L James such a hard time. Sure the gramer ain't non too perfect but hey! There's no shortage of poorly written books-take for instance Vianno-now she's as wierd as hell [[ASIN:B00BTMRSAI Flipside]] her grammar anin't stellae but she can hold my attention. Heck she can hold anything of mine if she wanted too the DB. Anybody can use spellcheck but who can be so dirty? So yeah, way to go James!
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|This is another paranormal teen series. I do not mind them since I like just about anything.<br /><br />I enjoyed this first book however I did not become completely hooked until a little past the half-way mark (then I found that I couldn't put the book down!). I'm not sure why, there was plenty going on in the story to keep me from getting bored. I think it may have to do with the fact that the movie trailer seemed to draw me in, which is how I learned it was from a book series. And I'm VERY excited about the movie to come out in August!<br /><br />There are a couple of things in the story of this first book that I was disappointed about and think it would have been better if it were different. Maybe the author has a surprise coming towards the end of the series and it ends up changing things. Only one way to find out!
B00846WWVM|2.0|Angry Birds has more substance than this one  and it gets tedious! I dislike games that require Real money to compete in casual play
B001HN6EF4|5.0|These are perfect for small kids.  They wipe off so easily from the kids sticky fingers and spills that small children have all the time.  I can already see that these will save me all kinds of money.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|It took us about 2 weeks to put together but it was a fun build that the whole family participated in. When it was done, it immediately became the center of attention anytime anyone came over.<br /><br />A solid Lego build with a ton of fun features.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|For those who are saying update is broke, uninstall your current version than install updated version. Works great,  no problems.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Picked up in the second half. Some parts were far fetched and over dramatized, but that's to be expected. It's a cowboy'ish kind of read...appealing and entertaining.  Have a tough time grasping the IT vulnerabilities. Thought China's proposed strategy- south China sea followed by Taiwan- was spot on.  Other strategies were not pursued (e.g. no mention of Korea or Japan?) which leads me to think that this book is meant more for sentiment than for realism. A fun book though.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|The movie was captivating. The lie at the end resulted in my belief its just a BS story. viability of the movie impacted.
B005SFS4ZU|3.0|Was a little disappointed with this DVD. Was not what I expected, it was to much like an old fashion opera and I diden't know all of the songs they sang.
B00BMCLCG6|4.0|I've loved them for about 27 years so maybe I'm biased but I think this one is better than The Circle by far.  I read some reviews saying people thought it was a \\"corporate rock\\" album, but these guys have always written this way, sometimes a little edgier than others.  That's why we love them, because they aren't so far removed from our lives.  They make us smile and give us hope.  There's a sincerity and love in their music that comes through and touches me and I'd rather listen to them than \\"Gagnam Style\\" any day!  And in concert no one rocks as hard or as long (3 hours with no opening act!) as Bon Jovi!  Their music is the soundtrack to my life and I will always support them!
B00A0MJ9VY|4.0|Picture was very good, but not full or widescreen. It looked like the original format when show in theaters when first released. Nice to add to my Disney collection.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|Abe Lincoln kills vampires.  Good action, plot is a little thin, but it doesn't try to be anything it's not.  It's just Abe Lincoln...killing vampires.  That's it.  Personally, I found it hilarious.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|This mini series from Britain was extremely charming and entertaining. It was a wonderful surprise. How many girls have read Pride and Prejudice dreaming of meeting Mr. Darcy? Well, this series does just that. It takes the thoughts of many and twists those dreams into a storyline that was well written and delightfully acted by a talented cast, which includes Hugh Bonneville (Lord Grantham from Downton Abbey).<br /><br />If you are looking for a new twist to a classic Jane Austen story, then this is for you. And the twist is not just about Elizabeth Bennett. It is about the entire Pride and Prejudice story.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This movie was amazing and had me hooked from start to finish it is one of the best Disney movies I have ever seen.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|Great action... No story... If you're in the mood for a good action movie this is the one... But don't look for story here.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|I have been using Linkedin for quite a while and find it to be very useful. Good contact information source.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I really enjoy watching Downton Abbey.  I got my mom watching it, and she was number 200 on the library waiting list for Season 2; so I had to buy it for her.  Now on to getting her Season  3.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I would never believe that I would get into a game so much. It is very entertaining. laughing pigs rule.
B004TI5N38|4.0|I enjoyed the main character, and the rural setting.  It was a bit far-fetched, but that didn't keep me from enjoying the action and trying to figure out the &#34;who done it&#34; of the story.  Good lead character.
B0018AM1YY|5.0|Comes a time when one just needs good music. I have been a Neil Young fan for decades. Good tunes
044024613X|4.0|Throughout the book, I kept going back and forth about Jacob's guilt or innocence.  I would sometimes think someone else &#34;did it&#34;.  I was disappointed by the ending, though.  I'm anxious to read what others thought.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Well written, acted, and filmed. Hope it goes on for many years. These episodes go by so fast. Can't wait to see what happens next.
B0054SMID0|3.0|Not a bad movie, not a good movie. Semi-predictable.  COuldn't find anything else on TV, so I tried this as it was on the 'recommended' list by amazon.  It was free, so I took a chance.  McConaughey is entertaining to watch, but plays the same kinds of characters .
B00AKKS278|5.0|I am a substance abuse counselor......Miracle Morning routine provides excellent structure and positive feedback to clients.  Thanks for putting it all together.<br />Tom on Maui
B0054SMIH6|4.0|Not Matthew's best work, but still pretty good and entertaining.  Some good twists and turns, suspense.  I prefer this over Magic Mike.
B001NLL93W|5.0|To love is to live.  I hope everyone enjoyed this third book as much as I did. When you feel like you really hate a great story to end. I just remember love is eternal...... Fall in love with Clary and Jace......
B00BMCLCG6|4.0|This album reminds me of all the hits that have made Bon Jovi a great band while still sounding contemporary.
B008FYZIVY|4.0|I am disappointed in the color quality plus the quality of the background where the camera was focused only on the speaker.  In the TV version I could enjoy the quality of the decorations and people who were in the background plus their expressions to what was being said by others.  In these discs the people in the background have black lines across them that are light but visible and it leaves the features of people not in immediate conversation out of focus.  The sound keeps going up and down which requires me to adjust the volume every few minutes.  If mine is a faulty copy I hope I can have it adjusted.  I ordered the third season also and saw the difference in the color quality the rest of the DVD's were good quality.  There was no difference in the credits on the back of the package of season 3 except RALPH LAUREN was also listed as a producer.  Thank you.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This really is the first original science fiction series i`ve read quite a while. The characters may not exactly stand out, but the plot......wow! Its unpredictable, and unlike anything i`ve ever read in this genre.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this one, and will propably read it again.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This game reminds me of a game I use to play in school when I was hella bored where you play as a fish and...pretty much eat until you get really big. What would be awesome is if there was an unlimited mode, see how long you can survive and how big you can get. Other than that, this game is freakin awesome! :D
B00B23O96A|1.0|Well it might be underrrated fantastic cd with at least 1 mega hit I cannot find. Again better search in archives for the bootlegs with Jack Bruce or Buddy Guy than record \\"pls give me money\\" as it is a true sad story. So much undiscovered blues hidden. I cannot digest it.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|I believe him but less informative than I thought it would be. If you already believe in an afterlife,skip it
0062082353|5.0|Great book, couldn't put it down once I started reading, and would recommend it for anyone who is interested in knowing what went on in Irac and told by a real American hero.
044024367X|3.0|I just re-read Nothing to Lose and while I tend to agree with some of the criticism, other points seemed just wrong or wrongly interpreted.  I, for example, saw nothing wrong with Reacher getting a tad political. After all, loners and guys like him are easily 'disposed' of by law and governments. We used to have hobos riding the rails; now we have homeless living in cardboard boxes.And we, as a society, hassle these folks, and lock them up. Reacher easily could be 'classified' as a vagrant. He takes care of his own back but he knows and senses who or what will impede his loner lifestyle. I don't agree he is liberal or conservative.  Those words are cheap talking points and mean nothing. He is the old fashion RONIN, and sees his way of life is total freedom. Law inforcement might see differently.<br /><br />This book just expanded Reacher's sense of morality. He was a soldier after all, and has always indentified with the enlisted grunt. He wasn't rash when he 'sided' with the Vietnam deserters. Just because he said they were 'braver than him\\" doesn't make him a coward. It means he sees and understands all sides to some extent.<br /><br />Points I do agree with regarding the book: I loved the intro.. stranger in town and the town folk want to string him up. We all agree, Reacher doesn't back down from a fight, especially when he knows he will win. I thought the whole 'deserter' subplot was thin and really didn't make sense. Did the town of Despair welcome these folks? Hard to believe since they hated strangers, period.  I skimmed past all this because having girl friends wait in HOPE, while the menfolk 'hung out' in Despair to desert.. uh. Nothing much there dramawise. And the dead soldier/deserter seemed to fit nowhere/nohow in this book.<br /><br />Reacher going back to Despair constantly was tedious. I agree to that.<br /><br />And did Reacher... uh (SPOILER POINT)really blow up a whole town? Men, women and children? I was glad to read because of the rain the dirty Uranium was no danger. I am not sure about the drinking water later on. When I first read this book I thought the cult would \\"drink the Koolaid\\" and commit mass suicide, especially since the bad guy was egging everyone on to \\"Rapture\\". Who exactly did he want to blow up?  It would make more sense to have the preacher arrange the mass suicide and blow up his own town. I mean his constant ragging on ENDTIMES suggested that.<br /><br />OK .. points to Child for not making this book predictable (other than the fact that Reacher is always Reacher and he always gets laid) but I will agree that this book could have been better by going off in different literary directions than it did.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Awesome series.. Can't wait for season 3 to be on prime!! I have recommended the show to all my friends and family.
B00633W614|4.0|looking forward to reading the complete series. Typical Jeffrey Archer novel, easy, enjoyable, but I do hate the wait between releases.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Excellent App. Wouldn't be without it. It's in my \\"Favourites\\" & I use it regularly. Highly rated & Iv've no hesitation in recommending this very useful App.

B007PTJOV0|5.0|Fun and entertaining app that offers a great magical experience for all ages. I'd suggest this apapp to all who enjoy story based games and a challange.
141659521X|5.0|Another great Mitch Rapp thriller.  Looking forward to Vince Flynn's next release.  I've Never been disappointed with any of his work.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game is awesome. Very colorful. It entertains the young ones for hours. I would definitely recommend it for young kids.
B00B2GK4KW|5.0|Provides clean and accurate punches, offers a variety of sizes and takes up minimal space. It is easy to use with just a little practice (reading directions helps)
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The 2nd book was just simple survival and 2nd guessing herself.  This book may have overstretched itself.  Felt like it dragged a little. Overall, though it was still a good read.
1452101248|4.0|The recipes I've made from this book have been pretty good.  I own a ton of vegetarian cookbooks and although this is one of my favorites, it's not my go-to.  However, it is probably my prettiest book. I love the design and the photography. I also love how the recipes are organized by ingredient- so helpful.  I would recommend this book.
B008OTTRXU|3.0|Ended up liking only the one song.  This girl is going to end up being a one hit wonder.  .
0887307280|5.0|I own my own photography business and have read dozens and dozens of business books.  This is definitely one of the best- highly, highly recommended!

B0034G4OYA|5.0|This is great for the whole family, was lesson learning and funny!<br />Recommend buying for your Easter Baskets or anytime!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|ES File Explorer is a good choice for the purpose, it opens easily and does everything necessary, I was going to use Google Drive but it was not available to the tablet I use.
B000T00PE2|5.0|I am very pleased and satisfied with my purchase, this song is a good tempo chill out song to dream, make love, and just to relax to. it has a portishead vibe with downtempo mix feel to it.
B002KYHZLQ|1.0|I read the prologue and the first couple of pages of chapter one of this book. The dialogue was stilted and unbelievable, and the author's sentence structure was nigh incomprehensible at times. I returned it.
B0084AZXKK|3.0|Not my favorite book.  Seemed like there's no real point in the end.  I just kept looking forward the treasurer but in the end I just wasn't satisfied.
157421327X|3.0|I was a little disappointed with this &#34;book&#34; - it's more like a guide or pamphlet.  I guess it's okay for someone who has never seen Zentangle before, but it was much to elementary for a gift.
B0071F3T0K|3.0|It's a pleasant enough read, but why it's considered one of the great works of American literature is a mystery to me.  Effectively the story of a handful of guys who drink excessively while half-heartedly trying to bed the same woman, with a reasonable description of bull-fighting thrown in for color.  Read it years ago and completely forgot it; re-reading it reminded me why.
B000IKQMFO|4.0|A revisit to Gosford Park was on tap. It had been awhile,and after the last Downton Abbey, I was anxious to compare. It has been said that the most enjoyable times for the upper class in their country homes was between wars. Gosford Park proves that may be so<br /><br />November 1932, Sir William McCordle played by Michael Gambon and Lady Sylvia McCordle, played by Kristin Scott Thomas have invited guests for a shooting party. Sir William's sister Constance, the Countess of Trentham played magnificently by Maggie Smith, who depends on an allowance he is constantly threatening to withdraw. Lady Sylvia's sister Louisa, played by Louisa Somerville, who married for money. Louisa's husband, Commander Anthony Meredith , played by Tom Hollander. Lavinia, played by Natasha Wightman, married to Raymond, Lord Stockbridge, played by Charles Dance. Hollywood star Ivor Novello, played by Jeremy Northam. Morris Weissman, played by Bob Balaban, a gay Hollywood producer who has brought along his &#34;valet&#34; Henry Denton played by Ryan Phillippe.<br /><br />Downstairs, we meet the butler Jennings played by Alan Bates, the housekeeper Mrs. Wilson, played by Helen Mirren, the cook Mrs. Croft , played by Eileen and other valets, maids, grooms and servers. As we know from Downton Abbey, the downstairs is the most fun with the most interesting gossip!<br /><br />Someone is murdered, an investigation ensues, and the most inept Inspector, played by Stephen Fry enters the picture. We learn a great deal about the murdered person, not from the inspector, but from the gossip and the words not spoken. Kelly MacDonald, of 'Boardwalk ' fame plays a maid to Countess of Tretham. She is the most active in her sly ways of discovering a truth. Is it the real truth?<br /><br />This is one of the first films looking at the life of the Upstairs, Downstairs group. It is colorful, filled with humor and snide remarks. The sad life of the downstairs folks is fully displayed.<br /><br />Recommended. prisrob 03-17-13ob 03-17-13
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Thrilling movie.  Although the movie takes some dramatic license with the accuracy of the facts, it sets forth a wonderful story.
B0072GPQNG|1.0|As soon as the movie started and I heard the syrupy overwrought soundtrack,I suspected I was not going to like this movie,  and I was right. I loved the book and am a big fan of Steven Spielberg. But he lost his touch in this one. The movie is two and a half hours long. After the first hour we had seen only an extended corny \\"a boy and his horse\\" routine...all scored with the overly dramatic bombastic music under every scene. I fell asleep soon after and awoke at the 90- minute mark to hear the same treacly music and nothing much happening still. We turned it off,  I did the dishes,  and my husband caught up on a DVR'd program he had wanted to watch.<br /><br />Recommendation : Read the book..skip this crashing,  corny  bore of a movie.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Huge fan of the show, but never read the graphic novel. Think I'm hooked on the graphic novels now too!

B008JFUTT0|5.0|A Detroit singer-song writer Sixto Díaz Rodríguez made two albums in the early 1970s. These records went nowhere, and apparently the gifted artist disappeared. Later, someone in South Africa during the apartheid era heard these songs, which went on to become very popular in the country, but no one there knew anything about Rodriguez. Some say he committed suicide. What happened to him?<br /><br />Malik Bendjelloul's Oscar-winning documentary \\"Searching for Sugar Man\\" is a journey of two South African fans Stephen Segerman and Craig Bartholomew to find the answer. The journey is not only interesting but moving and thought-provoking, even though you already know the answer. (There is actually one unanswered question in the film, which makes it all the more intriguing.)<br /><br />What makes this film special is the great music of Rodriguez that you can hear in the film. Somehow fame eluded him just like many other gifted artists, but not now. Just listen to 'Cold Fact,' his debut album (from Sussex Records created by Clarence Avant, who is interviewed). You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />\\"Searching for Sugar Man\\" is not just a documentary about a musician. The film tells us that our world is still rife with mysteries. It is only that we just are not aware of that.
B0087IT8FK|4.0|This film has a great deal of emotional baggage that is felt by and pushed by the audience. A true story it is said, and it does give the human relationships a positive spin.<br /><br /> Philippe, played by Francois Cluzet, is a millionaire who was paralyzed from the neck down in a para-gliding accident. Driss, played by Omar Sy is a man out on parole for robbery, who applies for the job of Philippe's caregiver only so he can get a signature on his application for unemployment benefits. What Philippe needs is not only physical help but someone to cheer him up. Phillipe dares Driss to take the job for a month,and off they go. Driss is irreverent and clueless at times, and Phillipe is taking quite a chance. But, then, what does he have to lose?<br /><br />Off they go on adventures. Driss  pushes Phillipe through the Parisian night when Phillipe has an anxiety attack. They partake of cultural activities, art, opera, birthday parties and dating. Driss has the feet, Phillipe has the mind and money. This partnership is something each of them needs, and is an equalizer. One issue is the black/white divide, rich/poor divide. Not much is said of it, but it is there, staring us right in the face.<br /><br />This is a feel good film, tears at times, but the stupors is refreshing and a good time. The two actors,superb. Francois Cluzot, who plays Phillipe, moves only his face, and his remarkable features set the pace. Omar Sy the devil may care, Driss, and the man who is always moving, always looking for a woman. These two have chemistry, and the film is a good one.<br /><br />Highly Recommended. prisrob 03-16-13
B009AMANBA|5.0|Is That a saga or is it history ? We can ask the question and wonder. The inspiration from Walt Whitman is quite obvious and strong, showing Lincoln as the father of the nation able to filibuster like any other senator or representative, sacrificing his own life, his own wife, his own sons to the only objective he had in mind: to save the union by defeating the secessionists, which he did.<br /><br />But the film centers on the crucial period after Gettysburg and the famous address, after the \\"government of the people, by the people, for the people\\" till his death and his funeral. Those crucial two years of his presidency and of his legacy. To finish the war he had to cast in iron the freeing of the black slaves and that could only be performed with a constitutional amendment to the constitution, the thirteenth to be more clear, and then the rest and the next two amendments are what will come after him. This battle is essential and Spielberg plays with the situation with obvious pleasure. Votes of representatives or bought up, not with money but with administrative jobs. The promise of defeat to some Democrats in the North is also vastly used when necessary.<br /><br />In that debate in the House of Representatives in January 1865 some declarations by the slavery-leaning conservatives are funny in retrospect: menacing the House with the Black vote, with Black Representatives and Senators, and after that where will they stop? The menace of the vote of women and all other catastrophes that could happen if the Black slaves were finally freed by the Constitution. And the vote was won with a simple argument: \\"I am not for the equality of all things, but only for the equal rights of everyone in front of the law.\\" A typical compromise on the side of the anti-slavery camp. The US Constitution cannot declare everyone equal in real terms but only in rights. Yet it will take one more amendment for that principle to become true, the fourteenth amendment that is at the core of the debate on same-sex marriage right now, the Supreme Court's decision pending on the subject.<br /><br />This is so true indeed that what is important is not the real equality of people in material terms but their equality in rights. Then the equality in real material terms has to be built, constructed, won step by step, one step at a time. That's the American way. They do not look after every single individual case, but they state in general terms rights for everyone and then everyone is supposed to conquer the implementation of these rights. Real equality for the Black slaves was won only one century later, in 1964-65 with the laws on equal rights and the vote, one century after the full freeing of the slaves. A long, very long time and delay, but that's what it took for the slaves and then their descendants to get beyond the Post Traumatic Slavery Disorder (or Syndrome), for them to re-conquer their soul, rebuild their mind, reconstruct their self-pride and their future. And it took them more than forty more years to reach the top, and yet the President is not a descendant of slaves. The trip to equality is not complete yet, but it will be some time soon now.<br /><br />The film insists on a picture of Abraham Lincoln as a fast aging man surrounded by personal tragedies, like the loss of a first son to the war, and then the enlistment of his second son against his mother's wish and his father's advice, and then the crazy emotional state of his wife who is constantly oscillating between headaches and breakdown, with some moments of sane political vision. She was instrumental in Lincoln's life and decisions, but not as a direct inspirer, rather as an obstacle to negotiate, and that obstacle when negotiated opened doors to the next step or steps on the road to eternal gratitude of the Black people, by the White people and for the Black and the White people. Lincoln turned Gettysburg from a deadly defeat to a shining victory, and of the whole humanity as for that. We still owe him a bundle.<br /><br />The last element to say is of course about the marvelous performance of the actor. It is a challenge for any actor to impersonate a historical character of this magnitude. Daniel Day Lewis is one of the greater American actors in the line of the greatest like Dustin Hoffman or Jack Nicholson in the previous generation. It is so difficult to embody both the crumbling physical shape of the man and his building up resolve and stamina on the essential question that will make history, unluckily after his death. A brilliant performance.<br /><br />Think when you see the film of what the Lincoln Monument has become in Washington D.C. and you might understand the depth of this history in the making that is only coming true today nearly 150 years after the end of the Civil War. I will regret though the fact that Grant's and Sherman's sweeping fire trail down into the Deep South in 1864 and 65 is only alluded to and not shown. The horror of the war is rather discreetly evoked with one or two strong pictures here and there but very little altogether.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUe still owe him a bundle.<br /><br />The last element to say is of course about the marvelous performance of the actor.

B00BB8SKPW|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie and highly recommend it.  The airplane sequence was extremely well done and very suspenseful.  The rest of the movie was a really interesting exploration of the psyche of Denzel Washington's character, a long term alcoholic.  If you want to see a really well written and well acted movie with a smattering of excitement thrown in, then watch this film.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|I often wonder what our dogs think about our household and what they would tell us if they could.  If only their tongues were more facile and they could share their wisdom with us by words as well as deeds.
B006LSZECO|2.0|There are so many gems in the book.  Great insights into modern women, into relationships, into the sticky bringing together of wealth and non wealth.  But in generally I spent the first third of the book hating the two main characters and stuck around for the occasional zinger.  Then it finally got good when the big reveal occurred and the characters and the story took an amazing shift right, but the end of the book was a disaster.  Seriously disappointed that in the end the author choose to give a cross between Hannibal Lector and Alex Forrest (Fatal Attraction) the &#34;win&#34; and the horror of a child in this train wreck of a conclusion.

6302518423|3.0|Prospero's Books (1991) Director Peter Greenaway seems to be an inspiring Fellini.  The problem with making that comparison is that, regardless of whether you like this sort of film or not Peter Greenaway actually does rings around Fellini. &#34;Oh brave new world.&#34; This is much better than an adaptation with men in business suits. This film has people in birthday suits and the odd costumes work as if in a dream. Still as with many secondary interpretations it is interesting but it is the original that gives any value.<br /><br />It is good the VHS has a Pause button as the credits go by quickly. Based on &#34;The Tempest&#34; (published in 1623 however written around 1611) uses most of the original script but applies the information we all want to know about the contents of &#34;Prospero's Books.&#34; I keep an empty shelf in the library waiting for my own copy of the 24 books of great knowledge and magic.<br /><br />&#34;Prospero, once the Duke of Malan, now reigns over a faraway island, living with his only daughter, Miranda.  12 years earlier Prospero's brother, in league with the King of Naples, had exiled Prospero and his daughter to their new home.<br /><br />One evening, Prospero imagines creating a storm powerful enough to bring his old enemies to his island.  He begins to write a play about the Tempest, speaking aloud the lines of each of his characters.  In this story of Prospero's past and his revenge...&#34;<br /><br />John Gielgud gets to make the ending speech addressing the audience and just for a minute none of the exotic trapping with the exception of an echo.<br /><br />I suggest that this is not your first encountered with &#34;The Tempest.&#34;<br /><br />[[ASIN:B003Y5H5JM The Tempest [Blu-ray]]]
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|I have a very busy schedule and don't always have time for a full 30 minute workout.  Daily Workouts provides everything I need to work out for 10 ,15 or 30 minutes.  Also, nice to be able to target different areas or have a full body workout.  I have never been one to find the time to go to a gym and this gives me what I need without driving anywhere.

B000JMKQX0|5.0|Seriously smart, great book.  Weeks later I am still mulling over the diverse characters and different human, social, political nuances Max Brooks provided.  I love that the Zombies in the book were the almost secondary character.  Kind of like hurricane terrifying versus tornado terrifying.  Love the Chinese sub captain storyline, love the space station birds eye view, and loved the detail around the augmented military approach.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|A gripping drama set in a world of the zombie apocalypse.  The characters must make morally challenging decisions to survive.
B007REV4T8|3.0|No spoilers... nobody's going to read this review anyway because it's all been said before.<br /><br />So, this is the 50th Anniversary of the Bond franchise, and it has been a very enjoyable one overall!  I didn't dislike \\"Skyfall\\", but thought it was so cluttered with \\"Bond clichés\\" that the whole story began to collapse under the weight of them. To say that the movie was \\"predictable\\" is the greatest understatement of all.<br /><br />Certainly, in my opinion, Daniel Craig is the most engaging, compelling, and credible Bond of them all, so no criticism is directed at him, but again and again throughout the movie I kept thinking that Craig was wasted in this thing!  The first two Bond movies starring Craig were, again in my opinion, far, FAR more enjoyable and entertaining.<br /><br />Looking forward, it is obvious that there are going to be some personnel changes in the roles surrounding Bond, and I'm not particularly enthused by what I see in that area, either.  Perhaps the best days of this franchise are over... there's only so many boring sequences and other defects in a movie that any actor, even one as good as Daniel Craig, can compensate for.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Has an almost Zen like quality to it. I could not stop after my first play. The physics are incredible!
B00AEBB9K0|4.0|The humor in this movie is underrated. There's no stereotype that doesn't get made fun of. There's a reason this movie has a cult following, it's just good.

B004XJRQUQ|1.0|Not even close to worth the price it's selling for now. I read the first book for free when the Amazon library went online, the others were also free or maybe 99 cents (I can't recall). I cannot understand how this became a bestseller, I am convinced this only happened because it was the first book on the list when the Amazon Prime Library went live. The plot line is good and it turned out to be well suited for a movie. The first book, though poorly written, was interesting enough that I picked up the others. Unfortunately, the story line went to hell in book two and never recovered. The characters never developed and the writing didn't improve.

B00BEPVAV8|4.0|This app works great on my kindle fire HD. The graphics are awesome, this game is addicting and so much fun. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the starting is very sensitive and can get a little annoying sometimes. Other than that this is a really fun game.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have to admit I haven't always been a big sci-fi fan, more of a horror novel fan but since Stephen King has been growing kind of stale on me I've decided to start branching out more and a friend suggested this series to me. Boy am I glad I listened!<br /><br />The writing is so fresh and I love the descriptions and character development. I know so many have said much of the same things that I am inclined to write, such as \\"I was riveted\\", \\"I couldn't put it down\\", \\"I found myself wanting more\\". Yes, I second all of those and I too hope that this makes it into the movies because I believe it will be a classic indeed. But what I really came away with in addition to all of the above, is a story that reminds me that you should always question your reality and think about the way you perhaps \\"silo\\" yourself from the world because of your belief structure. I learned to question why I believe some of the things I do because that's just what I was taught. It can really be rather life changing if you think about it.<br /><br />But on a lesser note, I just love me a good story and this was definitely a good story. I intend to purchase the next in the series, called Shift, soon and I'm sure I will love that too, but for now I am just going to take a little breather and let all the lessons sink into the \\"down deep\\".<br /><br />Thanks Hugh! I know you're reading this because you said you read all of your reviews. Keep the books coming. I am a new fan indeed!

B00BEPVAV8|4.0|I liked the game but it is hard to figure out the steering but other than that it is fun
B005LAIHCM|3.0|The synopsis sounded interesting. Thus, I rented it. This film was a big disappointment. They should have saved their time, effort and money on this one. That is just my opinion. This film was not as suprising, interesting or scary in any way, except that it could happen in any town at any time. This is not the first time I saw a film with the same premise. A film entitled SleepAway Camp, something like that. In that one, the parents did the same thing as in this one. I don't want to give anything away. The acting performances are believeable, but the film is basically a dud. We had it figured out in the first ten minutes of this film and then just watched it to see if what we guessed was right and we were.<br />Overall, I can't recommend it, but that is your choice.
B00BMVTTJ4|5.0|I had read some reviews on streaming issues with the video and was hesitating to buy. I caved in to desire and bought the HD instant video anyway to be pleasantly surprised by a very good streaming experience. My playback was on a Panasonic TC-P50ST30 TV and I had 0 re-buffers and 0 lag. The video quality was very good and the extras package at the end was very interesting. AIV Rocks! :)<br />Suggestion - It would be convenient if there was an easy way to navigate to the extras package like it is on a DVD menu!
B003VANOFY|5.0|I have been using the Logitech G930's for a good 4 months now, and felt it was time to tell the rest of the world my review on it.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Has full 7.1 Surround Sound (Windows Systems only)<br />- Great battery life (I get more than the 10 hours Logitech says it gets consistently)<br />- Mic can be muted by the 'Mute Mic' button, flipping up the mic itself, or doing it in your OS<br />- Mic and 2.1 Sound work on Mac OS X<br />- Great sound<br />- Completely lag free<br />- Easily gets the 40ft of range, if not more<br />- Sleeps when computer sleeps (Windows only)<br />- Noise cancelling mic<br />- Volume slider works perfectly<br />- Adjustable sidetone (Windows only)<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- 7.1 Surround sound only works well in 3D Audio supporting games (Battlefield 3, Far Cry 3, Arma II/III, Crysis 2/3, Counterstrike: Global Offensive, etc.)<br />- Do not fit tightly on head, so don't expect to lean back and these and have them stay on<br />- The programmable G keys can only be assigned to programs that the G930 program recognizes<br />- No support on any major Linux distribution<br /><br />Other than that, this headset is extremely nice, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a high quality gaming headset, and is willing to pay a little extra for all the extra features.
0345505387|5.0|Love the series.  Mostly I have the ebooks.  The graphics were good, wished it was more than the first book though.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|An interesting and absorbing account of US special forces at war in Iraq. Chris's narrative puts you right there at the sharp end with him. No one reading this account can doubt his courage or commitment to his mission or his team-mates, the hallmark of the true warrior.<br /> That said, it is interesting to compare the attitude and belief systems of the \\"American patriot\\" to those of his counterparts in the spec-ops communities of other nations engaged in this, and other, modern conflicts.<br />Readers will no doubt draw their own conclusions on this.<br />I have no hesitation in recommending this account from a man at the tip of the spear, not hesitating to risk it all for what he believes, a trait becoming much less common in the modern western world,something which may yet come back to bite us.

B005LAIIFS|5.0|This is an excellent computer animation film from the minds of the artists of Dream Works. The storyline and graphics are nicely done and it is a very enjoyable film to watch with your children or grandchildren. Evil has returned to the world as the Bogeyman (Pitch Black) returns and he wants the recognition the way thinks he deserves it. He is jealous of Santa, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy and the Sandman and all the attention they receive from the children of the world.<br /><br />His new weapon is using his nightmares to give the children bad dreams and to slowly steal the powers of the Guardians so he can become a major force in the lives of children. Jack Frost is called upon to become a guardian and to help stop the Bogeyman. He doesn't want to help as he himself is not really recognized or appreciated by enough kids and he struggles with the concept of helping those Guardians who are loved by children. Jack has to choose sides, does he want to be loved or feared? What is his center of life about...<br /><br />This is an excellent story and the animation is just top notch. We watched it with our grandson and he enjoyed it a lot. We had recently watched several movies and this was his favorite of the movies we have just seen. We rated it as a 5 star movie for the family and your younger children will love it. This is great family entertainment; children and adults will appreciate the story and the beauty of this film.

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Downton Abbey is absolutely the best.  You will fall in love the all the characters.  I can't wait for next season.  The only complaint is that they are letting so many of the main characters die.  I worry where the story is going.  But I'll definitely be waiting to see the new season.  I bought the first two seasons to get caught up when I joined the show mid-season of season 2.  And who wouldn't want the third season just to be able to share with friends and watch when I can't find anything on TV.  Good buy!!
B003UBTX6S|4.0|A bit of a slow read, but very well written and interesting. I enjoyed this book. Now on to the third installment.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Got this game for the kids but ended up playin it alot myself.the graphics are pretty good the only thing i dont like is how easy it is to die. man i wish you had more lives and started at where u die.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|this app will not keep the &quot;like&quot; on alot of posts which really stinks and when u do like sumthing it moves the screen up
B003M6FGTE|5.0|I have loved Glee from the beginning, and it was good to go back and see how things got started. I was never a big fan of &#34;musicals&#34; until watching Glee.  It incorporates so much popular music and all the kids are so talented its hard not to like! I also like the aspect that if features kids from all different races, sexes and abilities.  From Artie in the wheelchair to Mercedes not being &#34;thin&#34;, the show focuses rather on their talent.  It is a good role model show for young teens dealing with the pressures of trying to find their niche and to fit in with the &#34;in crowd&#34;.  High school can be tough and this show is refreshingly different than the typical teen drama that is usually shown.  Would highly recommend watching it with your kids and discussing the episodes together.
0062014536|1.0|Like most of the reviewers, I LOVED the first two books. Seriously, I raved to all of my friends about the unique dystopian theme and the wonderful writing. I sat and read this entire third book in a matter of hours, because I was that excited!<br /><br />But when I got to the end, I was absolutely ENRAGED. I have never, EVER seen an author get SO lazy. To just end it, without absolution of the the love triangle, what happens to Hana, what happened to Portland...so incredibly lazy of Lauren Oliver to just end a story like this. I will be telling everyone how awful this book is.<br /><br />P.s. she seemed to have put in a LOT of thought into the curse words being added. Lauren Oliver, don't be to books what Bob Saget is to standup.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|The previews didn't make this movie very appealing to adults but my 9 year old wanted to see it. Myself, my 16 year old and my 9 year old son all liked it.  It did make my son very sad at one part.
B007HO392S|5.0|I love the songs on this CD. it what i want it. Love the song every song, also the auto zip download action.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|its ok i guess but im not sure i even need this for the kindle. but nice someone made the app in case i do
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Great story, outstanding movie and excellent acting by both humans and animals!  One of the best pictures of the year!
B00011KHTM|5.0|This device is perfect for my computer and projector and much less expensive than going through the apple store.  Yeah!
B008JFLWLE|5.0|the calculator was amazing. the only thing that would make it better is more space and an equation solver and/or graphing function. as a basic calculator it works great, but I want more!
B0011UJMK2|4.0|This book had a different theme than others of similar plot- the setting in Stalinist Russia was fascinating-definitely worth the read
B002QY9RMA|5.0|I love the songs on this CD. it what i want it. Love the song every  song, also the auto zip download action.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|down load for the kids to entertain them on long journeys or cure boredom.So go out and get it for your kid or the kid in you.
B00280LYIC|5.0|OMG! This book is BOSS!!! It's like a rollercoaster, you never know what's going to happen next. I would recommend this book for people from 10- adult. Like I said AMAZING…<br /><br />From @askinsfan
B0097EWK3A|5.0|The puzzles are hard enough to be a challenge but not enough to be frustrating.  The story line is great--would make for a cool movie.
B0091REZMW|1.0|It is very hard to navigate and to see the small items on the Kindle Fire screen and difficult to get to the rooms.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|This book was not what it seemed. I thought it was going to be a book that only geeks (myself included) would understand.  What it turned out to be was much more. The book combine action and a good plot to weave this tale.
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|This book is the best of the heroes of olympus series, yet. It made me read it later over and over again. Even though I read it like seven times, I want to read it again. I can't wait till the next book comes out.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Cheryl's frank telling of her hike, motivations, and thought processes in her decision-making leading up to the Pacific Crest Trail hike is an extremely interesting read.  At points, you identify with her and live vicariously through her journey and at others you want to just shake her and ask her why is she so naive and engaging in such destructive behaviors.  Then you remember she is young at this point in her life and marvel at her brave initiative in taking on this difficult journey.  In the end, I salute her and wish I had the same initiative to undertake such an adventure when I was that age.  A book that is hard to put down and worthy of the acclaim it has garnered.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Choose 5 star rating because I was then able to transfer a library book to my kindle fire with the adobe for EPUB books  Unable to do it otherwise  Very helpful app
0307592731|5.0|My son and I both read it.  I loved it.  So did he.  Written ten years ago, but, still a great read!
B009ICQ6KO|4.0|Years ago when I was in college I got to work for a giant concert promoter.  One weekend I was in the Bay area working 3 nights for Alanis Morrisette so I got a room in Union Square with my girlfriend.  I would take her sight seeing all day then work the gigs.  Best weekend ever.<br /><br />The second day we went to Haight Ashbury.  We went inside the guitar shop to poke around.  When we came out a young, unknown Ben Harper had an acoustic guitar and was playing for tips in his dreadlock cap.  I knew right then he would make it & dropped $10.<br /><br />The first legitimate star to make ME feel important being a bouncer was the late John Lee Hooker.  The half a dozen times I got to kick it with him are treasured memories that will stay with me for eternity.<br /><br />This album has a Hooker & Heat feel to it that is inescapable.  I'm actually glad it took this long to be made. It took me three years to accept anybody covering or playing like the Hook after he passed.<br /><br />Based on the above when I played this album tonight it felt like it was recorded just to please me and I'm not mad at that.<br /><br />The only ding I can find is that it could have been a double disc set with a whole disc of Harper blasting his saz but it is not.  Entirely tragic and completely self centered as the rest of this review is.  I know.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|it was an app not much to say about it but download was fast and i would download more apps for sure
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My Horse is a great game with addicting features and best of all it is free, witch doesn't always work out as a good app. You should really get it!(:
B00BLGXL3U|3.0|Other than the stunning performance of Joaquin Phoenix this movie was nothing special. More of a character study than a story. If the writer/director did not want it to be mistaken for a profile of Scientology history then he shouldn't have copied every single Scientology event that has hit the headline news in the last 30 years! As has been noted by many,Phillip Seymour Hoffman even looks like L. Ron Hubbard. But for anyone who loves Joaquin Phoenix, this movie is a must...he should have gotten an Oscar for this performance...stunning beyond words.
B001IAOEXU|3.0|This product is the best because it helped my in so many deferent ways, and I can't get enough of it.
1400052181|5.0|I read this book last summer and would reccomend it to anyone.  The author put ten years of her life into research for the book and even became a part of the family who learned so much about their mother through her.  I learned a lot from her insights into the history of the time it was set in.
B00280LYIM|5.0|Nice book, and rick Riordan did it again a amazing book in the series that adds a lot of depth into the book allowing another piece in the prophecy, and it is recommended to all kids ages 9-older
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|its handy when you need a calculator i would recommend it for a download and i will keep getting apps from here
B009GXHOW4|1.0|I went to go on it but it won't let me. why? I totally recommend to not get this game.
B008OTTSX4|3.0|My favorite DP was with Tommy Bolin, I really was never into them beyond the BIG hits like SOTW. The Santana version is pretty good and contrary to most I think the Flaming Lips version is pretty cool. Reminds me of being in Junior High School and trying to keep a band going, yes we were that bad. LOL<br /><br />Bonamassa is excellent btw.
B000SEIBB8|5.0|A good start to DPs, showing their role in software architectures and providing a structured and pragmatic reference to 23 DPs.<br /><br />To take the next step and deeply understand and decompose those 23 DPs, I suggest you &#34;Elemental Design Patterns&#34; by Jason Mc C. Smith.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This was a great movie.  A very suspenseful, action packed story of our history.  It is well worth the money and I watched it twice.
0743297334|2.0|The book had no plot.  I kept expecting something to happen and nothing happened to hold my interest.  Mostly going to bars and fighting over Brett.  The part that was most interesting to me was when Brett met up with the bull fighter then Cohn got jealous and beat him up.
B000000WJ2|5.0|I bought this CD to test the sound stage of my listening system.  This album ans my system sound great.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|you need to buy this I spend all day playing it its like having wreak horse to take care of! !!!!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Walking dead is definitely an amazing show! Quality and availability on amazon is great! Cant wait to be able to make these purchases from a mobile device rather than only the computer.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I just enjoy the playfulness and how relaxing this game is.  I always end up playing far longer than I had planned.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Its like watching a multimillion dollar Hollywood movie every episode!  I have to write ten more words so this is
B004CIIXC8|4.0|During an outing near a stream, the camera closes in on the mouth of a fish, freshly handcaught, and struggling for air for what seems like painful gratuitous moments; which is then skewered for cooking only to be left laying on the ground licked by a dog.<br />My favorite scene which (I'm sure) catches many viewers by surprise is the 'saying goodbye' dance by the dysfunctional family. It simply states how there is some sort of love in most relationships regardless of how seldom the members react positively towards each other.<br /><br />(Please Note: There is some graphic violence towards Keira, a 5 year old character towards the end of the film.<br />Also for fresh perspectives on this film visit Amazon.co.UK)
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton is historical fiction at its finest!  If you are looking into Season 3, you know this already because you've watched Seasons 1 & 2.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|I was a little disappointed with the last book. I wish there was more about Alex and Lena's relationship. I did like how it went back and forth between Hana's and Lena's perspective. I also liked the way it ended.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|One of the most enjoyable books I have read in a long time.  Loved the writing language-style of the author.  Looking forward to reading another book by Vanessa Diffenbaugh.
B008I3RARW|1.0|It will not run on my android tablet and I can't uninstall it  Please help.  I want to get rid of it.
B0014VQGX4|5.0|My son loves this toy, it is easy for him to use yet has enough different moving parts to keep him occupied.  Very glad I bought this, price was great for what we got.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|Great storyline and well acted by Peter Weller as Batman and an amazing job by Michael Emerson as The Joker
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|this game will not let me play it.  I push play and all it does is load and the goes to a screen that says tilt and touch and then .........NOTHING!! Do not get this game!
B004SDSSFY|5.0|This is definitely worth the money!!! The free version is okay, but I am so happy that I bought the full version!
B004DNWPY4|4.0|It is on the news that many lottery winners end up declaring bankruptcy and many movie stars and athletes are plagued by drug and alcohol abuse and AIDS.  But I did not know that even lawyers, doctors, and the like are not necessarily builing up wealth when they spend their high incomes lavishly.  And I can tell in observation of just my small town which people were good financial managers; it is the people who lived in the same house for forty or fifty years, and were able to keep it not only when they retired but also when they lost their spouse.  And they generally drove the same cars for many years too.  Me?  I am out of debt completely; , my car is a 2004 Ford Focus with 128,500 miles on it; I paid $30 for my watch that I bought in 1987 and still wear now; I have and wear clothes more than ten years old.  I am living on just 56% of my gross income and my 401k and IRA are growing in leaps and bounds.  I may be able to retire at 59 1/2, when I can start withdrawing from retirement savings without tax penalties.  Do not be envious of big spenders.  Read this book if you need some motivators.
B003QSMCKO|5.0|My girlfriend hadn't seen this movie so I rented it so she could see it.  She thought it was really cute and loved it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Awesome app.  It saves me from having to carry a bag full of books everywhere I go.  It does not matter where I am located, I can break out my device, and choose to read any of books in my library -- again without the hassle of carrying them around and wearing them out.  The app is good for hi-lighting parts of your book, especially if you use your kindle app for your school text books.  You can view your books on any of the devices you own, which supports that kindle app.  I wish the app would incorporated the text to speech feature to have my text book read to me while I read along with it, or just read to me at times I am busy and would just like to hear my reading assignments over and over.
B004HAEGP4|4.0|If you are wanting to watch a zombie movie, well, pick one, it's not like choosing between Woody Allen's most cerebral comedies.  But anyway, as far as zombie movies, this one is full of  good action scenes and most of that includes Milla and a nearly infinite amount of ammunition.  'nuff said.
B002X3V4P2|5.0|Love to think about personal stuff by listening to Enya ....<br />This Album has a lot of good songs.....<br />I recommended to everyone .....
0385537816|5.0|This is the 5th time i have bougth these books, and these are beautiful and the quality i always wanted
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|Pure unadulterated garbage. Even a great cast couldn't save this horrible script and direction by Paul Thomas Anderson. I feel dirty, pissed off and $4 poorer.
B006LQQ1GE|4.0|There are a few songs I automatically skip over, but this is STILL a album to own. The songs that I really think make this album worthwhile are: &#34;Easy Way Out&#34;, &#34;Somebody That I Used to Know&#34;, &#34;Eyes Wide Open&#34;, &#34;In Your Light&#34;, and &#34;Save Me&#34;
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Very confusing. Couldn't figure out how it all worked. Not a game I would play in the furture. Not worth my time.
0062197266|4.0|For her first novel, this is good material. It is very slow and often overly descriptive but finds a way to keep the reader interested.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addicting and so much fun i can play it for hours without getting bored sometimes I play from when my kindle is fully charged till it dies[[ASIN:B009UX2YAC Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition)]] get it today
B00A77II0U|3.0|I was enjoying this game when about halfway through it locked up and I had to delete and redownload it.  Now I have to start over and hope i get through it.  It had a nice flow and hope I think so a second time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book. The love story,  the tragedy. It is all perfect. I probably would recommend this book to junior high schoolers and higher.
B003Y5H5EW|3.0|First off, I also have the other 3 movies in this series, so I feel confident in saying this movie isn't as strong as the others. It has a lot of holes in it's plot, and you'll find some of it a bit cheesy at times. I think what annoyed me the most is that they didn't bring back the original actor who plays &#34;Michael&#34; (Scott Speedman). You can clearly tell it's another actor with prosthetic make-up pieces applied to his face to look like the original actor. But, if you haven't seen the other movies in this series before watching this one, I still think you will enjoy this movie.
B0091REZMW|2.0|If there is a pay version of  Mystery Manor it may be better. This free one is annoying. Find three or four things and the room is done. pbbbbt
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Very well written book. I couldn't put it down. It had an ending that I would have never guessed in a million years
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game works well.  I'm just getting used to it on my new Kindle Fire.  In fact, I think it is easier to move cards on the Fire than on the PC.
B007VYAJAE|4.0|He was an ambitious person to be able to come so fair in a land of poverty and turmoil. Wow.
B009NQKXYK|2.0|This movie starts with such a potential, so promising... then just after the middle imagination rapidly runs out and one looses count of all the cliches. Such a promise, such a disappointment. And so many cliffhangers... so many... This movie barely makes any sense.<br /><br />** SPOILER ALERT ** In the end this movie turns out to be a badly-made prequel of Alien. I guess they had to make the connection to a good movie hoping it would lift one's opinion of this movie from the gutters. This movie is money wasted.
B000002WAD|5.0|This was one of the first CDs I bought as a young teen. Listening to it now in my 30s, I have to say that it's just as fresh as I remember it. These days not too many albums can boast 100% satisfaction. Most of the time only one or two songs are worth listening to, but this entire album is fantastic! If I was forced to pick some weaknesses in this album, I'd have to pick \\"It Would Take a Strong Strong Man\\" and \\"When I Fall in Love\\" -- But, every time I listen to this album, it takes me back to the days when I was a giggly little girl swooning over RICK. Plus, he's got that voice -- a voice most artists don't have today.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Played original Quell......loved it too!! Challenging, but no hopeless. Lots of fun to play, solve, and then try to improve your score! Highly recommend to all puzzle lover's!
B001AQT11M|5.0|The price was very good for  the movie and my four year old niece loves the movie and watches  Stallone time.
0307463745|5.0|It's so fast and easy to read! (I think I finished the whole 271 pages in 2 days.) I love that it's not filled with nonsense like most books. It gets straight to the point and every single sentence has so much useful information.<br />I've given it to multiple people to read and I'm about to read it for a second time. It is definitely a MUST READ for anyone who is planning on starting their own business.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|I love movies and I kept debating if to watch it. It's too long and boring...glad I didn't waste my money at the movies. Should have used Redbox.
B004HD61KE|5.0|i forgot i had purchased this book until amazon emailed me asking for my review. so i finally read it last week and it turned out to be a great surprise. love history! love mystery! if you do too, read this book.
B009738XXM|3.0|I bought this album because &#34;Call Me Maybe&#34; was really catchy. After listening to the entire album, I realized this selection of songs is better suited for teens and young 20-somethings. It's overly bubbly and cute. I could see how great this album would be if I were 16 or 17 -- instead of 32. Never the less, I think Carly has a future in that age bracket.
B001AH6ZWY|1.0|Terrible experience - could not get through the first few minutes of this movie on my Google TV.  &#34;Shockwave plugin crash&#34; kept happening.  Extremely frustrating - please refund, as I can't watch this film.<br /><br />Aric
B003K1EYM6|5.0|This product is great especially if you have a go pro camera.  It makes uploading video and pictures quick and easy
B003V4AK8E|4.0|I think over all its a solid controller. If you like the xbox controllers than you may like this one. Over all I don't think its better then the original controller even though it seem more sturdier. It just doesn't have the in-game feel of the original controllers but its a good controller in its on right though.
B004KZOWEG|3.0|The book describes the horrible things that happened to the people of the Belgium Congo under King Leopold. However, it got a little slow in many parts. I would have like to have seen more emphasis on the Congo itself as opposed to the European and American responses to the atrocities.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|very cute app. clearly aimed at kids... but enjoyable for adults too. its a litter corny. but still fun to play.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|it was just okay. just another Bruce Willis shoot 'em up movie.  had an interesting premise, didn't really follow through.
B000V63B5E|5.0|This is one Bon Jovi fine work.Love this album from the first to the last track. I've been waiting for them to release something as good  since this one but...
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Loved this book.  My hands actually shook near the end... and I cried through the whole last chapter.  I love a book that can get to me like that!
B00386EZJU|5.0|Spent a weekend watching this movie with my grandson, several times!  Like reading a book repeatedly, as the young ones will request.  Own the soundtrack - now need to own the film.  This grandfather will watch this one repeatedly as well, and never tire of the timeless story.
B005C8ENI0|5.0|Matthew Mc does one of his usual parts great parts as someone that doesn't follow a straight line. Here you have a lawyer with no office that does well cause his expenses. He goes to visit his clients. I guess that's a great idea having no office no staff only expenses the car and driver. The way this main part was written could only be played by a good actor and in this case  Matthew makes it work. Good movie!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think it is much more detailed than temple run and is a very good game, but it needs more careraters .
B00BSBT8M6|2.0|I went on and on. the scenery was good<br /><br />It was a movie I think could have been a lot more condensed and made more sense.  The ease of us of the account was great
B001NHNG64|3.0|Good book. The story is a bit unbelievable, but that is what this series is about.  For a heinous killer, it was fairly tough to grapple with reacher surviving this one
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I recall the events of this terrible event like it were yesterday.  A good friend I've now known for several years, was with the State Dept and just by chance, caught a flight out of Tehran the day before the taking over of the US Embassy.  However, I can easily understand why the Iranians were pissed at us.  Nonetheless, this was a great movie, and I can easily see why it won Best Picture.  Too bad Ben Affleck didn't get Best Director, but this was still a coup for him as well as George Clooney.  The story is well written and the suspense is awesome.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone, especially our younger generation to fully understand why things happen the way they do, and how we managed to rescue six hostages by the 'skin of their teeth.'
B0012GMVSU|3.0|I rate films by their music.  If the music is good, the film will be as well, in my own opinion.  Actually have not seen this one entirely through from opening to closing credits......unAmerican of me, I know.
B00ADYYBFI|4.0|I love the show and the music is just as good! Definitely worth what it cost me.  Would recommend. Try it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is epic and I highly recommend it for people. On this you can do all kinds of things like building houses and fortresses to fighting monsters with swords! Now I am just waiting fo da next update but yeah this is an awesome game and its totally worth it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is awesome! I downloaded it late one night, after my uncle had shown it to me.  I thought, 'oh, I'll just play a few levels and then go to bed.'  An hour and a half later, I'm still playing.<br /><br />You get a check for completing a level and a star for completing it in the least amount of moves; I'm obsessed with getting just stars.<br /><br />One downside is the amount of hints provided. Considering the 'Regular pack' alone has 150 boards/levels, I would think that there would be more than just three hints; a ratio of 1:50. But those three hints apply to the whole game, not just the 'Regular Pack''. Once they've been used that's it, unless you want to purchase more (though the cost of purchasing more is pretty reasonable).
B007REV4YI|4.0|This Bond is almost as good as the first JaMES BOND.  CONNERY WAS THE BESTOF THE BONDS.  THE LATEST BOND IS ALMOST AS GOOD.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I really like the different ways to play this game. The variety is great and really challenging at times for testing and exercising my older brain.<br /><br />AndI even like the music and sounds better than most!
B008220DGE|3.0|The performances, cinematography, and daring of this film gets five stars.<br /><br />The writing and originality receives one star.<br /><br />Freddie Quell is just Tyler Durden rehashed on 70 mm film and with a faux scholarly twist.<br /><br />I am all for pushing the boundaries of cinema and happy that this film has created a dialogue. But I am sorely disappointed that a boring, poorly written, quotation soup, post-modern film disguised in classic clothing is considered great film making.<br /><br />Making hundreds of cool allusions to classic films and ripping off the plot line of a modern classic is, in my opinion, sophomoric at best.<br /><br />P.T. Anderson has reached that sad, comfortable, impotent place known as buying into your own hype.<br /><br />The ego is not only the master in this film, but apparently also the master of Mr. Anderson's career now.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book tells the stories of an American hero Navy SEAL sniper.  What I find interesting is the point-of-view from his wife through the many excerpts in the book.  I've never seen that before and it was something that gave light to the sacrifices that military families endure during multiple back-to-back deployments.  Excellent read!
B00BUADSMQ|4.0|Please ignore the negative reviews. This movie is worth seeing in the cinema. The car chase alone is worth the price for admission. I don't get it when people say there is no plot because as far as I can see there is a story with a twist at the end that pays homage to the original Die Hard, actually there is quite some scenes that are a throwback to the previous Die Hard movies. And at its core it's a father-son relationship much like the one in Wrath of the Titans(which is also a very underrated movie in my opinion) that, although nothing new, gives the movie some emotional weight. So please if you like action movies or Die Hard series at all, give it a try.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Can't wait to read the next. I really enjoyed the series so far. I'm sure you all won't disappoint. Great
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am not one to watch soaps with all the conniving and backstabbing but this one has kept the &#34;on&#34; button on.  I think one of the appealing parts is that the screenwriter did not repeat scenes or narration unnecessarily.  Everything about the production makes me want to see more.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is a blast...reminds me of going to the fair as a kid!  Makes it hard to put down.
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|It is an okay movie. It is amazing or I would say something impractical that someone could fly a plane after doing cocaine and drinking whole night. But not a bad portray of the man's struggle to leave alcohol.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|This app is not easy to navigate through with 7 inch kindle. When first purchasing I received a message that app was corrupt.  This app needs some work.
B0018087TC|5.0|Fromg his opening phrase to the final coda, this is Chet Baker at his finest. His nuanced playing and accomplished backing musicians make this CD a joy. I've been a lifelong fan.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I hope all pilots do not begin their flights this way.  The story is more about one man confronting his alcoholism than flying commercial airplanes.  The guy who wrote the script knows exactly how alcoholics think and how they behave.
B000W93CHC|5.0|The author weaves a story around characters you can see  &<br />makes the middle ages come  to life. A type type of life that was<br />Privileged or quite desperate. A Great read.
1400067820|5.0|Taleb's intellectual arrogance is a delightful experience. After Fooled by Randomness and Black Swan, Antifragile is another tour into his profound insights, his iconoclastic disdain for 'accepted wisdom', and his entertaining prose that brings back delightful memories of Bertrand Russell's masterpieces.<br /><br />His basic message is simple and clear - welcome and leverage uncertainties. The protection against fragility is not robustness, but antifagility. Avoid large, interconnected systems that may not survive turbulence. Create systems that benefit from change, as the fire gets strengthened by wind, whereas the candle goes off.<br /><br />The message may be simple. The experience of how he conveys it is the rich dividend one gets by reading the book. I particularly liked his section on how he didn't let his schooling interfere with his education (Taleb meets Twain) and spent years reading all that there was to read on Statistics, while doing nothing else. Fascinating. Inspiring.<br /><br />Taleb also provides great insights into the original of the last economic crisis. Despite having over-read about this topic, Taleb's insights are delightful.<br /><br />Intellectual edutainment at its best.<br /><br />(With Kindle, I could buy it hours after its release and consume it in a few days. Yipee)
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Not what I was expecting, but still good. It held my interest all the way through the end. Definitely recommend.
B004SIP9Z6|3.0|I watch a lot of movies I didn`t like before that would take the number 1 in that list I had no understanding of it at all! Wow! That movie make me feel so stupid!
0345803507|4.0|I loved the series but with this book, I feel that the ending was rushed and some of Ana's escapades were a bit unrealistic, even for a fantasy book. Although when you love the characters so much, who cares? But that would be my only complaint beside that there wasn't a fourth book waiting after I read this one!
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|I was  hooked at the first episode and can't wait to see what follows.  The acting, setting, and story are superb.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|l cant put it down. having fun playing. good memory game for me. hopefully wat they say is true and I get a sequels. if not gonads me mad.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The Book Thief is about a young girl trying to make sense of the insanity of World War II Germany.<br /><br />Its crushing of innocence with senseless adult behavior reminds me of The Boy in Striped Pyjamas. Its chronicle-like characteristics are similar to Anne Frank. What makes The Book Thief stand apart is its empathy with ordinary German citizens suffering the consequences of war, particularly the misery it brought to the German nation towards its end.<br /><br />Of course, there is the ever haunting Jewish perspective. Of course, the brutalization through Nazism is omnipresent. Of course, the courage of ordinary people is present.<br /><br />Yet, The Book Thief is much more than all this. It is a moving tale of an ordinary German town coping with a horror they got swept into. It is a moving tale of a young child coping with this horror along with her family and friends.<br /><br />A truly moving tale of a History we must learn from, lest we repeat it.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Awesome zombie killing<br />Great special effects<br />I can not wait to see the second season<br />One of the best shows on television
B00003CXD0|4.0|Mr Hoffman does an excellent job in a representation of the hard time actors and actresses have to get a part or a roll to a paying acting job!
0345803493|5.0|With this book, (sorry no pictures) and the first one, Fifty Shades, it reminds me of the lame excuse guys would always give about playboy magazines. 'We don't get it for the pictures, it's the great articles in it, really, I promise! These books are quite explicit,and can be shocking for some, but I could not put it down because of the story line between Ana and Christian. Also, the attention she received, the way she felt, everything so new, like when you were young again and it was your first time falling in love or falling for some one. All the other stuff I won't, and can't, comment on, You will have to buy the books and find out for yourselves!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I read a lot of books with this type of theme or subject matter but seeing this on TV is as good. This film is so captivating and well done.  I hope the writers and producers keep this coming.  So darn good.
B004WGIXX4|5.0|I didn't want to drop watching it. I gave it 5 because I was enthralled and had to rewind to hear something I missed.
B005TVYVI2|5.0|So glad to have the &#34;Pro&#34; model - now I can change the battery. Smart purchase for anyone wanting to glide further and smoother
0143119680|2.0|The parallels to the Twilight series are almost too numerous to list - let's see - a young, sassy, intelligent woman unaware of her own powers (let's say Bella).  A handsome, powerful vampire with more money than the Vatican (let's say Edward).  Lots of lip biting - (really, have you ever bitten your own lip so hard as to draw blood unless you were falling off a bike)?  Forbidden love between the vampire and the witch (hum heard this one before) - resulting in the \\"Congregation\\" (read Volturi) bringing the wrath of all the other jealous deamons, witches and vampires down on the hapless pair in an attempt to force them to follow centuries old traditions.  Deamons, Witches and Vampires square off and pick sides while the unlucky lovers get torn asunder and find each other again while riding horses and drinking aged wine in antique filled rooms.<br />In Ms. Harkness' favor I will say she is a better writer than Stephanie Meyers - however her story seems to be a complete rehash of the Twilight series - nothing fresh or new - couple meets, couple is forbidden to be together, couple fights back.  Fortunately, it is a fast read for the most part - at times the author tries to impress us with her knowledge of wine and history which makes for some ponderous passages that amble on for several pages before she brings us back to our cursed couple. I was disappointed after reading so many favorable reviews - it didn't live up to the hype and really - didn't the Twilight Series cover this story already?  If you are a die hard Vampire or Witch fan you will undoubtedly enjoy this read - for the rest of us mere mortals I recommend you keep looking......
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I am enjoying this.  Don't do a lot of reading, but being able to pull it up on my iPad gives me more incentive to keep reading.
B009GIPDQS|4.0|Not his usual courtroom drama, but a great story that wll keep you turning the page, with a wonderful twist or two.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|I read the book when it first came out many years ago and really liked the story.  I think it is one of those that is better in print than on film.  The whole story part is very good - we all appreciate it when someone discovers himself and the meaning of life.  However, it seemed to drag on too long and the tiger in the boat seemed to be puppet-like at times, the manipulation of him seemed too fake.
B008QTVNUI|3.0|Implausible on just about every level—from the personal to the<br />professional—it is still acceptable entertainment. The amount of<br />sex thrown into the mix is patently obvious as a sop to the pit<br />(in Shakespearean terms). Did we really have to watch Brady<br />masturbating in front of his wife? Do scenes like this advance<br />the plot? No. Would a CIA or Homeland Security agent go rogue<br />by sleeping with the suspected terrorist after Constitutional means<br />of surveillance have ended? Not likely.<br /><br />If you suspend demand for televised sensibilities that rise above<br />popular culture, you can idle away an hour pleasantly enough<br />with Homeland. But Blue Bloods and The Good Wife are superior.
0316226130|2.0|I put off watching the movies until reading the books so I spent a week in between real life to get through them... Yes get though them.  In the end it was a Big. Fat. LETDOWN.<br /><br />I really enjoyed Twilight, and parts of the others.  Aside from the fact that the character development is lacking ((understatement)), and at points drags on pointlessly, there is an addictive story underneath that you need to see through to the end.<br /><br />Enter Breaking Dawn.. ((SPOILER ALERT))<br /><br />So Edward and Bella get hitched, much to Bella's dismay.  Forever with Edward, becoming a vampire, sure why not!  But marriage Oh the horror!!!  Would have been nice to see Bella have the least bit of interest.<br /><br />The honeymoon turned  Bella into a sadist, willing to sacrifice her body and safety for some satisfaction from her man.  Edward who never wants to put Bella in any danger agrees to this.. Sure.<br /><br />Then the hell spawn makes it's appearance known and Bella is showing her pregnancy in a matter of days.  Edward freaks out and rushes Bella home to Carlise to remove the \\"thing\\" from her.  Bella forms an alliance with Rosalie to save the half breed infant.<br /><br />A little while later we have Bella with broken bones, chugging down sippy cups of blood to sustain the baby's life.  We find out that the little vamp child will literally chew through momma to get out.. Great.  When that looks like its going to happen Jacob and Edward bring the baby into the world, or Edward chews through her uterus while Jacob does CPR to her bloody face, ya know, cause she was puking blood.  And did I mention this was all seen through Jacob's point if view?<br /><br />So at the last second Edward stabs a syringe of vamp venom into Bella's heart and she turns.  After a few days she wakes up from the burning of the turn and she's a graceful perfect little vampire.. Beautiful, graceful, and totally in control.  No newborn issues, hardly any bloodlust..Soo exciting..<br /><br />Best part? Jacob then imprints on the baby.  THE BABY!!  Creepy much?  Yes fiction.  Yes fantasy.  But still creepy.<br /><br />Skip a bunch of pointless pages and we get to Irina who sees the baby and reports to the Volturi since there is a rule against turning children to vampires.  So Alice totally disappears leaving Bella nondescript clues to follow and everyone else starts prepping.<br /><br />Pages upon pages of build up to the exciting climax of a fight which Never. Happens.  HUGE LETDOWN!!!<br /><br />Vampires from all over the world show up to witness Nessie and her wonderful specialness to prove to the Volturi she is not a threat.  So with the help of Bella's new vampire gift of shielding she protects everyone from any harm and Alice shows up at the last second with a child like Renesmee who is mature and obviously not a threat to anyone and that's it..  Never mind! No need to fight!  Everyone can go home now.  WTF??!!!<br /><br />I felt dirty (baby imprinting) and robbed!  The characters changed drastically.<br /><br />There was no climax before the happy ending.  It was just not what you hoped for after a four book series.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|I don't usually spend a lot of time writing reviews, but this game certainly warrants one! Excellent game play and great replay value! It's not often you find a game that is so unique and surprisingly fun and addicting to play. Highly recommended!
B001CEE1YE|3.0|I bought this item for me because I love this trilogy and it's sad to say that this trilogy was shortened in each one, there were parts of the movies that were cut out! not a good idea!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have this on my I Phone but would like on my Tablet also but no clear instructions on how to add to itl
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I read On Wings of Eagles a few years ago when Ross Perot assigned a group of men to go into Iran and bring his men home.  So I thought I might get bored with the film, thinking it would be too similar.  However, it had its own identify and was a thriller.  This is a must-see for those who would like to know the stress our foreign workers go through and what happens when things go terribly wrong.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|best game I played its so so so so so so so so good kids will love it a lot and want to play it a lot
0345803485|5.0|I bought this book as a gift for my best friend.  I do not know anything to tell u about it
B001O3SSWY|5.0|By far this is the most moving and emotional soundtrack John Williams has ever written. I love the amazing chords and beautiful solos.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Now playing game number 169, can't stop playing this game,addictive and fast. Graphics a little dated but really good fun.
B00BP29SAA|5.0|I bought these games to entertain my grandson while waiting in the doctors office.  They are fun,  educational and a fantastic bargain!
B006MW3UZW|2.0|This episode is actually exceptionally good.  I gave it only 2 stars because it took 2 hours to watch due to lag issues.  While it was playing the video quality was horrible.  I have not had similar issues with Netflix or HBOGo, so I'm assuming Amazon is the problem.
B001NOQI3U|5.0|I've seen this movie before and knew I loved it.  This was my &#34;test&#34; movie for streaming from Amazon Prime on my Kindle.  I am a romantic and this movie is a true romance plus.  Amy Irving is beautiful as Hadass and Mandy Patinkin is strong and wonderful in the role of Avigdor.  I love the words and melodies in the music--Papa Can You Hear Me? and more....  The movie was crisp and clear and colorful and easy to hear.  I shall be doing more Amazon Prime rentals on my Kindle.
B004ZA9HB4|2.0|Works, but extremely hard to connect and to stay connected. only wanted it to stream my own videos not the lame ones available
B0086700CM|5.0|This app is for young or old. I am addicted to the Temple Run and now the Temple Run 2. This app is a must have.
B004SUDQE0|1.0|I was horribly disappointed by this movie.  Whilst I thought the idea behind it was fun and cute, it was not at all well done.  I did not laugh a single time during this film, and by the end, was utterly bored.  The soundtrack was dull and seemed to consist of the same few tracks played over and over again.  The \\"romantic\\" aspect was non-existent and the characters were not at all interesting.  I did not find this movie romantic at all and would not want to watch it again.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The Walking Dead Season 3, one of the best shows on television.  I love every minute of it, I'm looking forward for the rest of the season.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this series.My daughter and i watch it together.We never watch it without the other.I would probably watch it again
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It is the best game ever.I think everybody should get this game. It's a very addicting game. Once u start u can't put it down.
B001ANSS5K|3.0|The book was good but when compared to some of his other books, such as the fault in our stars and looking for Alaska, it doesn't seem as great. The idea of the story was good but for me I felt as if it was dragging on and I was just excited to be done with the book. I would recommend reading this book before John Green's other books
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I totally love the mixes! Before we went to bed last night, my wife played this app on her kindle, while I played the same mix on my nexus on the opposite side of the bed. We actually got them in sync and had it in stereo! It was sweet! Thanks so much!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love jetpack joyride so much it is so fun getting all different kinds of things in the stash its addicting and fun its definetly a must get.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This app is a pleasure to play. The horse moves nicely, the competitions are challenging, and the minigames are fun. I really don't like the adds every few minutes popping. up in the middle of what you are doing. Other than that it is a five star game. Beautifully done.
0590259385|5.0|This book is really cute, and it rhymes well; which I did not expect. The story line is good, and my little one likes it. The only down fall is the graphics are a little outdated, but my son and I still enjoyed the book
B005C8ENI0|5.0|Loved this movie!  A great combination of drama, suspense and dry humor -- salted with a good dose of reality about the hard edges of criminal defense work.
B008XCM18Q|4.0|The Bourne Identity is a good book but a better movie. Fans of the film beware, this is not the Jason Bourne that you know. The book and the movies are very different, most of the important characters from the other movies die in this one, the villain is different and more defined, Jason's past is explained more. All in all, a good read but don't buy it if you're looking for a carbon-copy of the movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is the greatest game ever. I can play all day and most days I do. I enjoy completing missions and unlocking boards and characters. thanks mom. I recommend this game for all kids and adults.
B00B1MJ02K|5.0|This album has the songs that are included in a new PBS special filmed in Portofino, Italy.  Beautiful, romantic, enjoyable music with Andrea singing non-operatic songs (oh my!) including &#34;My Way&#34; by Paul Anka and the Italian version of &#34;September Morning&#34; by Neil Diamond.  He also includes a few duets including one with his lady love, and one with Chris Botti.  This is a wonderful album that shows more of Andrea's talent singing other styles of music besides opera.  He is wonderful talent.
B00ATUEKY8|4.0|Love how real and true the words are. It brought me awareness that many people are struggling.<br />It is amazing
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This is a great book and by far the best of the three!  I hope there will be a movie on the way.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is amazing! I could not stop reading it every time my mom told me to stop reading I would hide it under the table so I wouldn't stop. In my opinion The Hunger Games is filled with action, drama, and romance.<br />  When I watched the movie I thought it was okay but the book was better.<br /> Suzanne Collins is a genius.
B004499LX0|4.0|I usually can't stand romantic comedies, although this was more of a comedy-drama ... I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! The cast was superb! Natalie Portman always holds her own... Clive Owen was amazing as he is in any role he takes on! Loved Jude Law! The connecting stories and the complex feelings the characters had for one another turned out to be funny as well as thoughtful.  This is one of my favorites, I definitely recommend watching this!
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|This is such a fun movie and has a good message.  I love Antonio Banderas as the voice for Puss, and Selma Hayek as the voice of Puss's lady love.  The animation was very good, too.  I recommend this movie to anyone.  Great fun!
6304493681|5.0|Great classic anime DVD. There are enough reviews out there on this film so I won't bore you. I only have to say that it's great to get older stuff at good prices! }:o)
B009HUB40Y|1.0|When this game was downloaded, I was not aware I would need to continually put money into it to play. The game is so-so. I think because to continue to play you have to purchase additional coins.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|This is a fun game and has a mario brothers feel to it, so if you're a fan of that game, odds are you'll be a fan of this one too.  There are some bugs to it though.  There are quite a few levels that start off where the hero leprechaun automatically falls to his doom, there are some save points in it that will resume your game in an automatic doom state.  Too bad, it is very fun.
B00846WWVM|5.0|This game is super fun and great for the kids. My kids were thoroughly entertained and loved every minute of it.
B000OCXI3K|4.0|This was not what I was expecting. Never saw the movie but I might try to find it now. The story is very engaging...difficult to put down! Started in the morning and finished the same evening (I haven't done that in a long time!) Very enjoyable.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|you should make a chapter 2 with 4 levels City, Mansion, Lake, and Forest include night with flashlight and everything else the same -Slender Man! Chapter 2:Always Watches
0385537697|5.0|Best books I have read. I can reread these books over and over again and not get tired of them.
B00992CF6W|1.0|So I got this game, and was so excited to play it. So I just got an Amazon gift card so I could buy it... after all, $6.99 is pretty expensive. It downloaded fine, worked fine, I was playing on my file, then all of the sudden it doesn't work! I was so so p***ed of!!! I wasted A LOT OF MONEY! So great for those people who it works for, but this is a WARNING!!!
1932735410|5.0|Very easy to read. Definitely follows the PMP preparation requirements.<br /><br />You definitely will not be disappointed. I'm very pleased.<br /><br />Thanks.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I have enjoyed this series so far. Good plot, moves along nicely and edge of seat kind of story that has continued to keep my interest. I'm going to stay with it to the end :)
B00BBRPRDG|4.0|I have always loved Poco, and this album takes me back to their earlier sound.  Wonderful album which I heartily recommend.
0385537670|5.0|So thankful this book series came out in hardcover. They not only :) ave a special place in my bookshelf, but as well as my heart. Excited to see this come to the big screen.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I love this book . It is AWESOME. I have read this book before.  I recommend that you read little women
B00BETX5PS|3.0|I would have expected more action for a 007 movie, i would rate this movie the worst of the 007 movies yet.  Best part of the movie was the song by Adell.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|The writing style in this novel was a very good fit for the plot itself. Very engaging, writer pulls the reader in at various opportunities; almost as though directing the reader through the twisting and turning story. Hard to put down. The ending was poetic justice!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|you get to eat almost anything you want which makes hungry shark evolution so awesome and you get to eat other sharks that are bigger than you.
0385537689|5.0|Loved it. Amazing, sexy, irresistibly passionate and naughty. NO MORE EXPLANATIONS NEEDED. A MUST HAVE. AS AN INSTRUCTION MANUAL OR SIMPLY PUT A TO DO LIST FOR OUR SIGNIFICANT OTHER LOL
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This book got you deep into the world of casters and mortals. Great book that can take you out of this world and into the world of casters
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I think that subway surfer cool but I think that u don't need 100 eggs to get a new hover board
B004CJ05FU|5.0|What a great show. I loved all the characters and the story line. I only wish there were more seasons.
B009Z59ZNE|5.0|the BBC &#34; House of cards&#34; trilogy is an excellent t.v. series.  Ian Richardson gives the character its sinister personnality in a most Shakespearian  style. Although it is a bit dated, It still is  sinister, intellegent, sharp ,demanding the audiance concentration and a bit of an intellect. Much better than the new American version!!!!!!!!!!!
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Fun peaceful and challenging.  Physics based puzzler where you grow bigger to complete a specific challenge.  Well worth a purchase if you like puzzle challenges.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is really exciting and fun!!! i love the different challenges it opens you up to new things and it really helps your hand eye coordination!!!
0812993292|5.0|It took a while for the book to get here; it was in good condition.  I enjoyed the book; it was recommended to me by a friend.  She is a teacher and enjoyed reading it during her summer vacation.  Quite an interesting story; challenges us to think about how we choose to live our life....get out there and live: move forward, do the things that bring meaning to your life.  Forget the fears that are all around us everyday!
1564029654|5.0|Favorite book from when my children were little.  It is now a gift I give to anyone with a new baby!! Love this book!
B009CF7GRY|4.0|This was a really cute movie and it was better than i expected. The quality of the video was great, so no complaints with the stream.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|GREAT GAME so addicting can't put it down MUST GET if looking for a fun addicting GAME to pass the time
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use Evernote to track and organize articles and writing. I sync it up so I can access it from my laptop and Kindle Fire HD. I really like the fact that I can access it from home, work or a coffee shop!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|the only thing that I did not like is that the race's cost so much power other than that I loved it
B000JCSBU0|5.0|Loved the music, the story was interesting in terms of how life can turn in the midst of drug abuse.  It's a story kids should watch to hopefully scare them away from the life changes involved in drug abuse.  The cinematography was really cool holding my attention.  A must see!
B00BHMF578|4.0|This is a rather uplifting movie for an American.  I'm not sure how it would play to a non-American audience.  The characters are well developed, the plot moves, and it's not overly dramatic.  I did like this movie but it didn't give me a &#34;wow&#34; feeling that most Best Picture Oscar movies leave you with.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|I didn't like the book as much as the other books by Jeff Kinney, it was a little too much potty-humour for me. I'd recommend this book for older boys.
B001XCWPAM|5.0|este producto es muy bueno gracias por el buen servicio, me funciona de maravilla y la calidad muy buena me gusta
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|hard to play at first. gets better with time.  coins are hard to come by you have to play a lot to upgrade.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was a very easy book to read, fast and very intertaining.  A very good &#34;escape&#34; read.  I also likeed the writer very much.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|This is another standard great Bond flick.  It's the usual great mix of heart pounding action, alcohol, and romance that have made the Bond series a classic for over a generation now.
B003WUYRGI|2.0|So, it was okay... not the best I've read, but I guess I can live with it.  It took me fourteen months just to get through the first half of the book.  Brockmanca@att and thy name is so stupid it's funny how the best writer for following me fourteen months ago by actress kung everyday itching to the best of israphel part 43
1885167776|5.0|This book will change the way you look at life altogether. I highly recommend it,& have purchased it for everyone I love and care about at a deep level.
B005HEQ4XQ|5.0|I have loved every minute of Star Trek the next generation! I never gave this show a chance growing up and now I'm so glad I did!
B001XUPF2O|5.0|Good movie with great performance by Heath Ledger. This is a better installment than the first movie, and much darker than the Burton series.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|love this!! just like mario bros!! almost feels like im playing my sega genesis again hahaha higly recommend...havent noticed any glitches so far... controls seem to be spot on...
B0018RC7QE|1.0|OMG what a waste of time! Maybe in its day Meryl and Robert kept the screen alive with this supposed chemistry between them. These two characters were weak in their development and coming together as a couple. I watched it to the end kept thinking it would get better. Drawn out and boring. Yawn. Find something else to watch.
B009CGAUW6|5.0|I played this game back in the early 1980s and loved it.  Unfortunately, it didn't survive graduating high school, joining the Army, getting married, moving around, etc.  So sad...  It was like losing a family member.  When I discovered that Wizards of the Coast re-released it, I knew I had to have it.  I wasn't disappointed.  The game is still simple to play, but with enough variety and randomness that it's fresh every time you play.<br /><br />Great game!  A must have for anyone who loves/loved Dungeons and Dragons.
B005HED1BE|5.0|I never really have this show a chance growing up. I just assumed it was boring compared to Star Wars but I couldn't have been more wrong. I am so glad I got bored and check out the series. Sure the special effects are lacking but considering how old this show is the effects are awesome. If you are a first timer and are considering checking this out I urge you to give the enterprise and her crew a chance to entertain and amaze you!
B007L96VCY|5.0|I used to play this album some...hadn't heard it in years...sounds just like a beatle album...product and purchase experience...problem free
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great set of books. Very interesting.  Keeps your interest all the way through.  Well written.  A real page turner. Enjoy.
B0014DQSG2|5.0|this is a graet family movie, good morals and it has Colin Firth would recommend this movie for your to watch
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Enlightening story to a world non existing to most people. The love story that evolves gives hope to those who have a tough upbringing.
1451683405|2.0|If you are a serious student of ideas you should skip this hour-long diatribe and go directly to more scholarly, careful works that treat this deep matter with the care it deserves. I would recommend Daniel Dennett's two books that advocate a compatibilist stance, or Robert Kane's or Al Mele's nuanced incompatibilist positions. There are also neuroscientists who have argued that free will is an illusion (Dan Wegner book especially, or the less good book by Michael Gazzaniga) and other neuroscientists, particularly Peter Tse in his recent MIT Press book 'The Neural Basis of Free Will' who argue that the brain does realize free will. All these other authors are nuanced and careful, even where they disagree fundamentally with each other. Sam Harris is not careful or original and not scholarly. He appears to be a populist warrior for his cause, which is similar to that of Richard Dawkins. Like Dawkins he comes across as being as dogmatic as the religious fundamentalists he detests. However, one can be an atheist and physicalist and still be open to the possibility that the brain can make choices that are free, either in the compatibilist sense of not being coerced by outside forces, as Dennett, Hume and Galen Strawson have argued, or in the incompatibilist sense of harnessing randomness, as James, Kane, Mele and now Tse have argued. Tse's book in particular delves deeply into the matter of how neural circuits could set the parameters for future decisions without specifying them precisely, so that choices are neither determined nor random.<br />  The question of free will is a deep matter that requires careful reflection and study, and is not done justice by a polemical essay with few citations. Indeed, this is hardly a book. It is essentially a medium-length essay that could have fit onto twenty newspaper pages if they had not printed it in big type to sell it as a book. That was presumably done to make money rather than delve deeply into a deep matter. It reads like anessay written by a smart college student, perhaps one preparing to debate an opponent who believed in free will for religious reasons. It is polemical rather than nuanced, and considers no evidence for opposing views. This is in no way a work of careful scholarship. It is basically a string of concisely written opinions that are hardly backed up by scientific evidence or careful philosophical reasoning. If you are serious about understanding free will you should go to serious books.<br />  I gave it 2 stars because it is well written. The argument itself would get one, since it is hardly a logical argument, but more of an opinion.

B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|I don't have much else to say that others haven't already said.  This is a wonderful movie that me and my daughter saw three times in the theaters and she couldn't wait for it to be out on disc.  There may be a few things that don't make a lot of sense, like the fact that the 'bad guys' generally always 'win' in real games.  Few players will ever completely beat the game.  And what arcade owner is going to leave his machines turned on all night long.  Nor mention that so many machines would be plugged into one outlet.  Or that any arcade machine would ever survive 30 years of pounding abuse by kids.  And like why in the world would Sugar Rush have double stripe tree branches that disappear when you are holding them, when its a racing game??<br /><br />But nit picks aside, the movie was great fun.  My 7 year old totally loved it, despite not understanding all the cool references in it that I could appreciate.  When Ralph goes to make the ultimate sacrifice at the end to save everything, we'll I'm man enough to say that nearly brought a tear to my eye.  There really isn't a lot here that isn't available in other movies, but it all comes together really nicely, and just feels great.  Definitely a movie we'll enjoy every time we see it.<br /><br />The BluRay could have some more features to it, but by far the neatest thing I have ever seen was when you pause playback, it will jump out to an intermission screen where a guy talks about the movie, and game references it it!  I've never seen that in any BluRay features and it was just an awesome addition to this disk.  I hope more studios do stuff like that, as it really makes owning the disc something better.
B0010TBQ0S|5.0|I have been looking for this movie for quite some time. I am somewhat disappointed in that there was no clear identifier that this was not a DVD purchase but access to view it instantly online. The good thing is I did not have to wait for the video to arrive days later. My only issue will be a continuous Internet connection to view this movie. Playback was awesome!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Great and very addicting and probably better than the real bejeweled. This is the best copier of bejeweled ever! If you are bummed about how much bejeweled costs, then get this one now!
0316228532|3.0|Whether by accident or in an attempt to distinguish \\"The Casual Vacancy\\" from her phenomenally successful young adult series (you may have heard of a wizard named Harry Potter), J.K. Rowling leaves the supernatural out of her first book written for an adult audience. Unfortunately, all the magic is missing. \\"The Casual Vacancy\\" is hard to get into and its characters largely lack appeal, probably for the same reason: in addition to omitting sorcery, Rowling steers clear of the exceptional. While it is possible to make stories about common lives work, it is far easier to engage readers in tales and characters of distinction and consequence. \\"The Casual Vacancy\\" isn't a clear waste of time or money; it's just not that great. We all know J.K. Rowling can do extraordinary. Fingers crossed for the next one.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I Love Minecraft just as the other thousands of kids in the world!! It just favorite game by far I hope these suggestions will help improve it: 1. Make a new update quicker!!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Kids loved it!  We rented it, but now looks like we need to buy it!  Highly recommended to those with children at least 4 years old.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|Just download this game yesterday and it took me a few seconds to get a good understanding of the game AM now hook could not put this game down just love it as it is very relaxing a nice way to calm down after a hard day of any thing stressful.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|I enjoy playing this game. The graphics are good. By  it takes a bit of time to get used to playing.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Loved this movie, but if it were my family's dog, I would have done something.  My brother recommended it to me, and we were both disturbed about the family's actions.  I won't go into detail, as it may ruin the ending for some people.
1401941893|5.0|It is a simple but good book. The internal design is really Miranda Kerr's style. It gives me a lot of positive energy and encourage me to be more brave to face life. I really love it!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Really a great game. Like the fact you never have to spend real money as long as you are patient.
B005IQZB14|1.0|A little knowledge is a dangerous thing. Woe be to those who believe Cheryl's hiking tale. Her personal struggles seemed real.
B009G7ZYPY|1.0|Like so many others I was amazed and thrilled when Susan Boyle took the stage and sang \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" on Britain's Got Talent. Here she sounds like any other competent singer. Not bad-just not great. In this over produced product they buried Susan Boyle. Too bad, she was really something.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|Well written, cast, a protagonist who you can't decide whether you like or dislike, feels messy and real. Dark premise.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I thought it was slow starting, but I have to say, after about 20 pages, I literally had a hard time putting the book down.  Every time I thought I knew what was happening, everything changed.  My hat's off to Gillian Flynn, it's a wonderful story!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I enjoy Colleen Hoover novels and this one does not disappoint. However, it does get a little predictable near the end. It is still worth reading.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|Very engrossing read - helped me to understand what happened in the collapse of the financial system.  Just as as I suspected - mass of stupidity and shoddy management at the top of our financial and regulatory institutions.
B00BMVTS1S|3.0|I am a Tolkien fan - this felt dragged out way too much - it felt like an obvious ploy to make as much money as possible from the Hobbit franchise. The constant battling scenes all seemed to flow into one another too much - not realistic enough by half if no one ever gets badly hurt or no good guys lose their lives against insurmountable odds.
0385349947|5.0|I must admit that I started off reading this book with some skepticism , mostly because I thought I already have some awareness on most topics. It was certainly reinforcing on many key topics. For example, don't leave before you leave, resonates very strongly with me. The few points that not only hit a 100% home run for me, but I consistently advocate the same to several colleagues and friends I talk to: Done is better than perfect (I follow this), work-life balance is not the goal (thats negative connotation, you can integrate and create a whole new possibility), and the Myth of having it all (this is mystical and conflicting in itself).<br />There were also a few topics that moved me and encouraged me to think differently. One of them was my reservations of leading or actively participating in topics and agenda that specifically focussed on women issues. My thinking was that the whole idea was that we 'blend-in' and 'belong', and by doing such events and agenda, we are countering that by calling attention to ourselves and showing a vulnerability. I could not have been more wrong. Sheryl has a call to action to refute such thinking, and transform minds that can transform behavior that will eventually impact institutionally. This is an era where complete work dedication is expected, ability to be a leader in any role is key to success.<br />I especially liked the definition of leadership as making others better as a result of your presence and making that last even in your absence.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I kept forcing myself to read this book to try to figure out what the big deal was about it. I hated it! It's digusting and poorly written.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Much better then oranginal, we watch a lot of movies, we were impressed,not for kids, a lot of bloody shots
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I tried this thinking it wouldn't work but it did!! The sounds help me go to sleep relaxed and calm. Recommend this app to anyone wanting some sleep lol
B002O3Z50Q|5.0|I love this movie, it's one of the best movies I've seen and the quality is fantastic and very clear i am very pleased with the purchase
1439152802|3.0|WARNING!!! **********SPOILER ALERT **********<br /><br />As other reviewers have mentioned, this book was long and I hate to say it, at times tedious. I never considered putting it down but I did find myself wishing it would speed up a bit.<br /><br />As Laurel unfolds the mystery - there were a handful of instances where her findings are repeated - as if the author was just making sure the reader picked it up the first time. I'm not sure why Kate Morton found this necessary.<br /><br />And it did seem a bit contrived in spots. For example, the letter falling through the floor and inadvertently being delivered to Vivien. The entire story pretty much hinged on that one incident that was so very casually told to the reader - as if in passing.<br /><br />My enjoyment level DID pick up near the end of the book. I had figured out the mystery earlier - but that's okay - it was still enjoyable and the ending was satisfying. I really liked Vivien throughout the entire book and was thrilled she ended up happy.<br /><br />I have a lot of respect for Kate Morton and will continue to read her books. I thoroughly enjoyed The House at Riverton and The Forgotten Garden.  I hope she takes this review as constructive criticism and continues to write her amazing stories - maybe just a tad bit shorter than this one.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I was surprised at how well I like this book. It was my first Colleen Hoover novel of many to come. I really enjoyed it, and it was a good, easy read. I love forbidden love stories!
B0094K1K8I|4.0|As part of the trilogy, this one was not as good as the others. It took a long time to get good. The only thing that kept me looking was the rumble in the sound effects and the fact of almost a naked scene.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I wish Mojong the creator of the app would make more items to make like computer minecraft like buckets sattles and cake. I wish they would make more animals animals that attacked you otherwise this app would be PERFECT.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book. I could never put it down it was none stop reading, chapter after chapter. I  am 12 years old and world recommend it for ages 12 and up.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Good book....interesting. Had a Gone Girl feel to it. Have already recommended ...trial within a trail. Ending goog, not great.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book completely sucked me in, and I read it very quickly! It's a love story full of conflict, suspense, and surprises! I can't wait to read &#34;Walking Disaster&#34;!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|If you like action, you will get all the action you can handle in the first 15 minutes. Denzel is great as always.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is an awesome games it take u to differ places nd they. Give u something that u would have a reason to play it I am jst saying u should get this game
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Good book...holds my interest. Only 60% through, but don't expect to change my rating. Would recommend to some friends based on what read.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read this because I heard so much about it, and I was extremely disappointed! I didn't enjoy it, it was poorly written, and parallels domestic abuse- it's awful!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This movie was really well done. I had never heard about these 6 people and the CIA agent risked his own life to get these people out. A true hero.
B008JGSM6G|2.0|This game is to easy. Well already the basic package(because that's as far as i got before it became boring.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|While I was playing this game, I found some cool features, like being able to chose the time of day and between two maps. But I found on big bug where if slenderman is at the edge of the world(outside the map) you can run up to him and have a virtually infinite starring competition without you dying and him him moving. Even though this was a bug, it shouldn't be complained about because it's so funny
B0034G4OYA|5.0|Really great for the whole family.  Kids and adults will find many moments to laugh and relate to plus it stands up to multi viewings!
B008MM9630|5.0|Similar to farmville but better in my opinion. The game is really cute and fun! I love it! I'm a total Wild One!!!! ^-^
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great game for my creative little mind. Great game for my son to he just loves it he loves it more than me.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Im not completely finished with us yet, but it's sooooo good so far. It's totally worth reading. You get transformed into the book as you read. I say read it, you won't regret it.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Ok, I downloaded this thinking it wouldn't be that scary. It is. It is by far the scariest game I have ever played on my kindle. When slenderman got the tentacles i almost dropped my kindle. Anyone who likes to get scared or is just a fan of slenderman, this is the perfect game for you, especially because it's only a dollar.
0385000499|5.0|The Complete Works of William Shakespears was rec. VERY fast.  I hav won a copy of this book many years (1949) ago. And really wanted it to go with other items.
0062082353|5.0|I had decided to hold off purchasing the book, as I had listen to Chris Kyle on many talk shows, but then after his sudden and unexpected death, I went ahead and purchased the book and so glad that I did.  I learned things that I did not know and later watched  Ultimate Warfare on TV where some of things mentioned in his book were also mentioned on the program about Fallujah. Certainly an eye-opener about the enemies and drugs.  Needless to say, it left me sad for his family, but the book was what I needed to get through his death.  I really liked the guy and he  certainly will be missed by his family, friends and many, many fans.
B00BEPVAV8|3.0|This game is okay it isn't the best game ever just like I said it's ok. Great grafics but horrible story line for the game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it's cool to play but it kind of wwaste star battery a little.but it's really cool how you get all these choices
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Unexpectedly, a really good movie! Great for kids or adults. Some twist and turns that you won't expect. Great storyline! I'd watch it again!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Downton Abbey..., need I say more?<br />The series is perfection - from set design to costumes to lines to intrigue to plot!<br />The series catches your attention, draws you in, and leaves you begging for more.<br />I own the DVDs for Seasons 1 - 3.  I will continue to buy the DVDs for as many seasons as the show runs.
B003V40SGS|3.0|This film was clearly influenced by Star Wars. The interesting part of this film is it use of CG, read a little of it production history to understand why. The film is almost a prediction of what we  are living today.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is TV that makes you think (vs relieving you of that).  We are loving catching up on the series.
B00B10DZQE|5.0|His wife dies. He falls off the first wave. Then he rides the second one. Marries the girl. Then dies at the end.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Downton Abbey continues to capture the imagination of all viewers!<br />If you are a fan of DA, you need the currently available Seasons 1 - 3 in your entertainment library.  Seasons 1 and 2 are absolutely phenomenal but Season 3 may be the most story-changing season of all!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|very good movies can watch them many times and still enjoy always seem to see something new thank you much
B005K0HDGE|4.0|King weaves this story well that it  is at once entertaining and intriguing.  Found myself wanting something more (or maybe different?) from the ending, but that is my preference and not a deficiency in the writing. Having said that, I loved reading this book and will recommend it to friends.
B00849F82E|5.0|An exceptional little book.  It is amazing how in the time since G. K. Chesterton somehow it became required that if one were Orthodox everyone assumed that they were also a.) boring and b.) impossible to talk to.
B000HF2NTE|5.0|-guns<br />-explosions<br />-one liners<br />-speech impediments<br />-a vicious motorcycle gang of serial killers<br />-hot rods<br /><br />Not shown<br />-gratuitous sex scene<br />-
B0053O89WY|5.0|one of the funniest shows on right now good humor with out being to crude lots of laughs thank you
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I recommend this book highly. It is one of my all time favorites. This book is really a glimpse into the mind of a true hero that sacrificed so much, for so little in return. I wish I could have shaken his hand.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I think it is great, the fit is perfect, no more worrying that my kindle is going to fall flat.  Works perfectly.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|great variety of puzzles, easy enough to solve, but hard enough to make you think! And lots of puzzles, thanks.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|good movie needed this one to complet my collection dont need to rate it if you havent seen it watch it
B000S559VW|5.0|Totally unique, inspiring and obviously influential to most of the rock that followed. One of the best indie, underground and pop/punk evolutionary albums there is!
096501830X|5.0|This book shows (in his own words) Adolf Hitler's common sense approach to many of the problems facing Germany in the 1920s and 30s, as well as his keen insight into most foreign policy issues of his day.  Long before coming to power, he made many observations and predictions that proved to be highly accurate in later years.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Well, Max Brooks is becoming the &#34;world authority&#34; on the Zombiepocalyse and this is the reason why. Written as a dispassionate historical narrative, it still packs a stunning emotional punch. Once he leaves his political bias behind and just goes into the stories it becomes a worthy read. A must read for us Left4Dead players!
B008JIWNYG|4.0|I need to see where all of this goes. I don't really care for Hal haing a replica of Sinestro's ring. Plus I've never really been sold of a green ring being the most powerful weapon in the universe. I am however intrigued by the Third Army and the first GL. I will pick up vol 2 and then see if I will continue with Hal.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|My whole family really loved this movie.  My 12 year old son particularly loved the sand man.  Even my two and a half year old was entertained and my wife said that it was the first animation she's seen that she really enjoyed too.  I definitely recommend this one.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|i got the dvd on two day shipped. i played the dvd it was  wonderful. saw the movie in  dec.
B005K17RU0|3.0|I wish it weren't upside down from everything else on my Kindle, and there's not much detailed information provided. Just basics.
B001P9EQH8|4.0|I use this between my phone and some higher impedance headphones and love it.  power lasts longer than my phone, and you can definitely tell the difference with higher end audio equipment.<br /><br />2 real cons to this amp: 1) you need to have the audio on the source player cranked to avoid hissing/static through the amp.  Not that big of an issue, but took me a little research to find out.  2) the volume adjust rocker is backwards on my unit.  Once again not a big concern but it is something I would expect to not make it out of the factory.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I did not realize that Les Miserables would be available so quickly on DVD! At such a great price as well!  As to the content, well, if you haven't seen the movie yet, order this, make some snacks, get some tissues, and sit back and prepare for an experience something you've never had before! If you are not familiar with the story, Google &#34;Les Miserables by Victor Hugo&#34; and just get the idea of it. Know that in the movie, the characters sing all their lines. Do not let this put you off - within about 5 - 10 minutes you will get used to it and forget they are singing. ***note to those who have seen and love the the stage musical version of the show that was on Broadway and traveled the USA - forget every memory you have of that version you have in your brain: wipe it away and just make room for this totally different experience.<br />That said, from the opening notes until the last credit scrolled by (yes, I'm one of those who sits in the theater and reads every credit!) I cried, my breath was taken away, my heart pounded, my heart slowed in sadness, I cried in joy, my faith was confirmed, my soul was lifted, and all repeated and not necessarily in that order!<br />My husband and I went to the first showing at our local theater on Christmas Day after going to Mass.Let me first explain my husband is not usually a fan of musical theater - this man totally fell asleep through the ENTIRE first act of Phantom! Well, not this time! Hubby loved Les Mis! Believe me, that says a lot! Now, granted, he did not go on to see it three more times like I did, but he earned a lot extra points with me that day!<br />All I can say is, is buy this package, enjoy this experience, and never steal a loaf of bread!
B008Y1YK9Y|1.0|The DVD showed the movie in alternating color tones, most of the time regular color, three or four extended times in darker color tone. This happened the first time I opened it new and watched it, which unfortunately was 6 days after the 37 day return period expired.  There is no option to send it back for a replacement, only an option to return it for a reduced price and with no shipping covered. There is no option to contact the seller.<br />  I have ordered a lot of DVD's from Amazon over the years, I had a probem only once, and it was returned with no problem. This is the second bad DVD I have received from Amazon already this year, and the only one that limited the return period to less than 30 days from when I received it. BOO Amazon, take responsibility for bad products and let me exchange it for a working replacement, or at least give me an option to contact the seller.<br />Go to WalMart, they will replace a defective product with no problem, and for a much longer return period.

B0095G5AFU|1.0|For almost three years, I used this app religiously. I've been writing stories forever and from the moment I got a Kindle Fire, I was hooked to this app. It was so easy to use and each of my stories were so easily accessible by PDFs. Over the years, I must have written over fifty stories on this app, each over a hundred pages. The night before everything changed, I was worried I wouldn't have enough space to write all of the books I had plans to write. Then, the next day, my life was changed forever. There were no directions, not one thing on how to work the more advanced settings on the app, and because editing PDFs had always been a problem for me, I pressed &#34;restore&#34;, hoping it would restore my files on another device. Honestly, that may have been the worst mistake of my life. All of my stories on that device, all fifteen, each over a hundred pages, were gone. They all disappeared. I had created a universe in that app, an entire world that no one could ever recreate the same way. My characters were each so unique and alive that I felt as if I were a pet of them. When they were gone, I felt like I didn't have anything else in my life. It felt like a part of me was missing. I did everything in my power to get my stories back and when I finally found a few of my files, I was overjoyed. But that was it. Only a few files that I had never saved, never backed up. Some of them, I had even deleted because I didn't like them. My most important stories were all gone. Even worse, five months later, after doing everything in my power to get them back, nothing has worked. I'm currently in the process of rewriting each one of them, but nothing will ever match up to what they were. A part of my life is gone because this app was not sophisticated enough to retrieve all of my files. So, please, if you're going to take anything away from this, please take this away: this app ruined my life. If you are going to use it, proceed with caution. Always send your notebooks to another device for safekeeping. I don't want anyone else to go through the pain that I had to go through, knowing that half of my life was gone. We can all relate to this - we've all lost something that meant the world to us, so please, if you read this, don't risk the safety of the things you love. If you're going to write on anything, write on Microsoft Word. I cannot stress how much better it is in every way.<br />Thanks for reading.

B00280LYIC|5.0|I am in love with this series, I feel like this first book is kinda meant for kids, but you have to read the rest of the other books because this is one of my favorite book series and I'm defiantly not 12. Also, it is extremely well written and the cliff hanger plot will make you cry. I recommend this book for people of all ages; it's an easy read but an amazing story.
1567184855|4.0|&#34;Journey of Souls&#34; is an insightful look into people's experiences of life after life, and I enjoy the stories he tells.  I do find the book somewhat clinical, however, thus my not giving a full 5 stars.  For someone looking for answers as to what to expect 'on the other side' it is a good rendition of many instances he has gathered from his regressive 'between life' therapy.  I recommend you read it for yourself.
B008WZHWCE|4.0|I especially liked the cast on this movie, it was an unusual different story line with a surprise (?) ending.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|the video is crystal clear love to see all the action , the sound is amazing but the movie is very long.
B005KDDUVS|5.0|Excelente libro, el desarrollo de la trama es consistente y en un buen ritmo, la variedad de historias y personajes concurrentes en ciertos momentos aportan al entorno de crear esa sed de finalizar el libro para adentrarse en el mundo descrito.<br /><br />Altamente recomendado.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|I read the book in two days, constantly taking notes and coming up with ideas. Such an exciting, inspirational book!
B008Y6TD5A|4.0|This is an action film, started out slow but Russell Crowe plays a major role here with lots of action and violence with an ending that could never happen in real life but was OK for a movie.
B00821OX98|4.0|I found this show on Amazon... Love Sci-Fi.. So had to check it out... Glad I did.. The characters are well written, the story is fair, but the characters keep you coming back.. Saw both seasons and am hoping there will be a season 3...

This is very important for maintaining continuity with colleagues and project associates.  Does just about everything I expected and hoped for at this level.<br />I highly recommend this application.
B007QDNKQA|5.0|Was a bit hard to get into, but once there was amazed. The plot was intriguing and probably true of how Washington is really run.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|great, straight forward calculator app. I don't want a lot of complications when I'm in a client meeting and trying to figure out costs. this is exactly what I was looking for.

B008OOYALE|5.0|I love to take care of my dragons in this game. It's very addicting.<br /><br />It plays. Nicely as well although it lags a bit.
B008VBYN80|5.0|I got this game because my iPod broke and there were no other interesting games out there. It's just like the game I had before
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Supernatural is a very well-done show. I must warn you, though (but if you're on the 8th season you must know). This show will capture you and will absolutely suck you in and make you cry. Have fun.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This game works great for the kindle fire!The graphics mess with you<br />once and awhile but other than that it is great!The app really teases<br />you when it says complete the tutorial and reach level ten to access<br />the aquatic park,I have the aquatic park and it is great!This app should cost 6.99 but instead it costs zero dollar's and 0 cents', and that is  why I rate this app 5 star!
B009JBZH54|5.0|This is a great group of movies at a pretty good value.  I got it somewhere other than Amazon for a bit cheaper, but the overall picture quality is superb and the extras are pretty good as well.  I would have liked to have seen more about Heath Ledger's portrayel of the Joker in the extras for the Dark Knight, but it may have been purposely omitted because of the tragedy surrounding his death.  Tom Hardy's portayel of Bane was on there and that was very interesting, however, so I cannot complain too much.  THe picture and sound quality is immense and as grandiose as one might expect from such an epic trilogy.  I would highly recommend this gift set to anyone who enjoyed the movies.  In fact, this will be the first time I will have seen the first in the series in its entirety.  I own the DVD of the Dark Knight, but this Blu-Ray is so much better.  The quality and pricing perfect for anyone who wants a piece of hollywood lore.  Christopher Nolan has quickly become my favorite storyteller.  His directing is nearly flawless in my opinion.  This delves into some unique perspectives trough his eyes, as well as osme of the actors portraying the various characters.  I loved seeing how each of the sets were designed and learning about the epic fight scene between Bane and Batman.  To me, the process is just as enjoyable as the overall final product and movie experience.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|I've seen em all.. And liked em all..and although I like the older bond movies more, this one is right up there with the rest of them. It's good!
B009HNDCC4|5.0|I loved all of these episodes. These are very funny and realistic. Keep them coming. In these times of so many crime series etc it is a pleasure to have real life comedy.
B0044XRIMW|5.0|Loved the movie and watched it without any problems!  Kids enjoyed it -a classic!<br />We will be using amazon for movies in the future for sure.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This is the first Gaming mouse I have owned and I am very pleased with the price, performance and ease of use.<br /><br />I find the buttons on the side of the mouse very easy to use. I play Guild Wars 2 and have programmed them so I can perform all character movement, except jumping from the mouse.  I find the mouse fits my hand well but I suspect that a left handed person may feel differently because the side buttons appear to be designed for a right handed person.<br /><br />The cursor movement seems responsive and precise and the buttons all work very well with a clear click when activated.<br /><br />The quality and construction also appear very good.  The cord is fabric covered and looks to be of very high quality.
B00B1L6B4G|4.0|Very good engrossing book about a policeman who is not a Nazi, but has to survive. Not a master writer, but my husband and I have ordered for friends and more for ourselves.

B006LSZECO|4.0|This book has a lot of twists and turns. It keeps you interested. It was really well written. Might read her other books.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I was hooked after the first chapter. So many questions, so many theories as to what the Maze is and why Thomas is there... I couldn't put the book down. Will definitely get the next book in the series.

0743233832|5.0|Stoicism made the Emperor's character so unique - best describe by his humbleness, respect for others, and sense of gratitude and indebtedness. The Handbook is full of personal realizations, and frequent citations on the teachings of those who have had direct or indirect involvement in his life. \\"Reading The Emperor's Handbook should be a liberating experience.\\", which is a promise fulfilled by faithfully reading the handbook, while framing myself to the place and settings in the ancient time, and personally subscribing progressively to what a Stoic must be. \\"Bear in mind that the measure of a man is the worth of the things he cares about.\\", says Marcus Aurelius. Overall assessment: Highly Recommended.
B001XVCYH2|4.0|The first matrix film is by far the best of the three but Revolutions viewed together with Matrix Reloaded provides an amazing conclusion.  The second and third films aren't as good as the first but still far better than most sci-fi or any film you'll see today.  And please watch in HD, so as to be able to fully appreciate John Gaetta's amazing special effects work.  His work on the first Matrix revolutionized and inspired the way many film makers think about how stories can be told visually.  His work in these films is masterful.  As far as the Wachowski brothers...they are geniuses and even their work on speed racer was far more than anyone expected.  Amazing minds at work on all these films.

159514188X|5.0|I absolutely loved this book, and it wasn't even meant for me. So I ordered this book for my cousin because she had told me her friend read it and said it was very good. I ordered it, and it arrived at my home so I thought about making sure it wasn't too much of a big read for her since she is very young and I got hooked! It is such an eye opener for teenagers, so I made sure my cousin read it!
B00B7G3OUO|5.0|Back in the early - mid 80's my brother brought home the Frank Miller Graphic Novel &#34;The Dark Knight Returns&#34; and I was blown away! Comics weren't like this...the art, the story of an aging Bruce Wayne and the demons he's struggled with during his 10 year hiatus...until he dons the cape and cowl again. The 1st movie and this one are true to the story, the art is impeccable, and the storyline engrossing. Do yourself a favor and READ the GN before watching this. As awesome as the animated movies are...there is no substitution for the Original Frank Miller GN!
B007EECSFA|4.0|This is a great read! If you can get through the first few chapters you're all set. Settle in, get cozy and follow along as the eldest daughter solves a great family mystery with an ending you won't see coming. Brilliant!

B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Works well. It's longer than the item that came with the kindle. Thanks you for the help. Issues were resolved quickly.
B00ARF92HK|5.0|...now we can all try to erase from our minds the stinking load Hollywood dropped on us 10 years ago starring Rocky Balboa. I mean Stallone couldn't even say &#34;Law&#34; for christsake!<br />Imagine the complete opposite, dirty, gritty....DREDD!<br /> I thought Urban did a masterful job as Joe Dredd. In one scene...he's choking out a perp for info and Anderson asks him to stop because her way would be  more effective.Urban turns, with nostrils flared and Dredd's trademark scowl....hell at that moment, he IS Dredd! Spitting image of a Brian Bolland DREDD pic.<br />As sick as the Stallone version made me....this made up for it in spades! More Please!<br />And next...how 'bout some STRONTIUM DOG?
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|A terrific exploration into the mind of Alfred Hitchcock during the making of Psycho. Sometimes Hopkins delivery will always seem just a shade of Hannibal Lector, but in this case it TOTALLY works. Helen Mirren is even better in the role of Mrs. Hitchcock, who really was in many ways the strength behind Alfred.
B00AEFY552|5.0|Since i saw this movie, I considered it as the best picture ever. It drama, actings and music is outstanding. I think they should make more movies with this kind of power on the story because it shows the crude human nature in a context that move the soul to another level.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I did read the book to the end but it wasn't one that grabbed me as it seems to have done to so many of my friends. It was just okay.
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|This cd has it all. A must have for everybody's collection. Quite Led Zeppelin-ish. Great debut album with so many great songs.
B00000272N|4.0|Alice In Chains, one of the best hard rock bands ever. They have a distinctive sound and are my favorite band out of the so called \\"grunge\\" scene. Personally, I think Alice In Chains is a hard rock, heavy metal influenced band. But anyway, Facelift is the debut album and without a doubt it is one of my favorites from the 90s. The band musically, combines harmonies with soft lead vocals, then sometimes the vocals increase to yells and back down to melodic again. The guitar riffs are nothing technically, neither is the drumming. But the main high point of AIC is Layne. Don't get me wrong, Mike Starr, Jerry Cantrell, and Sean Kinney are all talented musicians, but in the early days, Layne was the driving force behind the band and no other track solidifies that statement that \\"Sea Of Sorrow\\". The whole album flows very nicely and the production is great for a debut album. Personal favorite tracks are \\"We Die Young, Sea Of Sorrow, Bleed The Freak, I Can't Remember, and It Ain't Like That\\" This whole album is a classic piece of 90s music. With chugging guitars and Layne's famous vocals Facelift is an album that fans of any genre of music can enjoy. I recommend this album as well as their most popular showing, Dirt. Those two albums are must haves.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This was the only movie nominated for best picture that I didn't see before the Academy Awards and, they got this one right. Never thought Ben Affleck was a very heavy actor but is the evidence. And George Clooney once again produces. What about John Goodman. What a character actor! Worth the hype.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I like this game. It has allot of hidden objects,  and some of them are hard. you should try it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downtown Abbey is so well written, with characters brilliantly brought  to life. In watching, you develop a humanistic understanding of British history during the pivotal period of the first half of the 20th century.  Whether of the landed gentry or one of those that kept the household running seamlessly, each is graced with a human dignity as well as the human frailties that no-one escapes, regardless of class. Watching the characters maneuver through the intricacies of class society at that time and place, each constrained by his or her own station in life, is both fascinating and immensely entertaining.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app turns your Kindle into a digital  do-it-all and looks gorgeous while doing so. You can wake up to any kind of audio track you choose. Add as many alarms or reminder alerts as you need. It can handle it all ! You won't find any all around screensaver that will work for necessity as well as beautiful as this one. Does everything but bring you your coffee when you wake. Don't leave this one out !<br />PLEASED AS PUNCH !!!
B00A2BTCXI|5.0|Was exactly what I was hoping. Had no trouble with it being in cartoon form, 'cause it included the lyrics.

B004SBX112|4.0|Graphics could be better, but very challenging until you figure out the strategy, the sound is kind of repetitive.  Rio is still my favorite.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Compelling drama that everyone can relate to.  It had me right from the start.  One of the best books I've read in a while.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's very addicting. :) I thought I wouldn't like it but it grew in me. Recommended it for any age.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|It's an amazing game that I downloaded the only problem I have is deleting all files to temporarily download nova 3.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Definitely a step back in the right direction (after Quantum of Solace). A return to the action, pacing, plot and Bond trademarks we all love and appreciate.
B00A757EFW|4.0|This game is lots of FUN!!!<br />I loved playing Pac-Man when I was a kid and still do.<br />I only have one problem, it's a little difficult navigating Pac-Man through the maze.<br />I think it will get easier with practice.
B002RVCD0U|5.0|My son and I had watched all the other Terminator movies together except this one.  We found it available to stream and went with the SD more for my slow at time internet and the quality was amazing.

1451627297|4.0|I always love Steven King's writing, and I was not disappointed in this book.  It is a very large book, and I'll admit there were a few (very few) places where maybe I would have preferred a little less information.  However, with that being said, he did an amazing job creating characters (George and Sadie).  Long after I finished the book, their presence lingered in my mind. I love when a character becomes so real and fully dimensional that there's a sense of loss when I'm done with the book. I would definitely recommend the read.
B000FBJG04|5.0|As a retired Army officer I am humbled by what these great men endured and accomplished in order to keep our world free from tyranny.

B001AQO400|5.0|An engaging film in an unassuming way, Lost in Translation relies on the dynamics of character relationships and subtleties to portray a real story devoid of the cliches, plot crutches, and visual effects that go hand in hand with traditional entertainment.  In this sense, Lost in Translation is not a movie for those who only desire to be entertained, but for those who want to experience real characters and a subtle, unexpected story that is well developed by the talent herein.  While \\"entertainment\\" is certainly valuable, at times I feel we should approach films, and certainly this film, without the expectation of being entertained, but with emptied expectations, thus allowing the film, its characters, and its story to move you.  If you approach the film this way, I believe you will find yourself surprisingly involved in these characters' lives, in their seemingly mundane, but authentic struggles, and in the philosophical search for meaning amidst the world of entertainment, loneliness, and distraction so well portrayed in the film's landscapes.<br /><br />For the engaging subtleties and talent aforementioned, this is truly the only film that I can watch again and again and still notice new elements in the plot and relationships that revitalize the film and highlight how well each aspect flows together like words in a poem.  To know whether you will enjoy this film or any film, you must ask yourself what kind of audience you will be, and allow yourself to become the audience the creators of this film envisioned.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I for one think this app is very fun with gadgets and what not. That's all I have to say but I think I've made my point
160309007X|5.0|I have been impressed with the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen series since the start and have pre-ordered (months in advance) every subsequent addition of the saga as its released. This story gets better and more interesting as Alan Moore and company take his characters along with us into modern times. I was a bit skeptical at first seeing who the primary characters to drive this episode would be, but was throughly impressed with the twists and turns the story line took as the plot unfolded. Alan Moore's never-ending ability to place unbelievably strange, inter-dimensional, cross-cosmic, and truly insane (yet great story subject matter) events in otherwise plain settings is amazing. His story lines are still full of the super-political, socially relevant, magical, mystical, and other worldly material, but still manage to have it all be in regards to the tender, human, genuine human experiences of his main characters. Alan Moore and company are storytelling geniuses and will forever have me a collector of any and all works attached the names of  Alan Moore and those talented enough to be teamed up with him in further, subsequent graphic novel enterprises.
B00AG6Z92C|4.0|I think Andrea Bocelli is a fine singer and I enjoyed his performance on this disc.  However, I found the selection of numbers to be a little peculiar.  I guess it's because some of the numbers were really not to my taste.  I keep the CD in my car.  It's good for covering up the sounds of the road.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I installed this app 1 week ago. So far I have only used it to make a shopping list and take pics with my tablet. I like the shopping list because I usually misplace my written list. With Evernote, I always have my list if I have my phone... Only thing I don't like is I haven't figured out how to delete my list yet. I think, in the future, Evernot will help me stay organized and reduce stress.
B00A3NQNUU|2.0|I think that this app should not charge REAL money for stuff and why doesn't anything ever breed the way you want
B003UBTX6S|3.0|Was good, nice continuation of book one.  Still felt like there could have been more to it in the beginning to middle.
B001TKD4ZI|3.0|Spark was just an ember for me.  I'm sorry, but I can't figure out what the fuss is about.  Typical paranormal.  Honestly it took me a week to read--I continued to go back just to say I finished.  I'd heard so many good things, I bought the hype.  IF YOU LIKE paranormal GO FOR IT.  IF you don't like paranormal, this is NOT FOR YOU.  It was just a typical day in the life of contemporary vampires...mundane with a few scenes that were amusing.  All that said, I bought two Sparks.  SO much hype, going to see if there is fuss for the series, vs this stand-alone.  I want to be caught up.  I want Sparks series to captivate me...wasn't sleeping.  I was yawning.
B002NZK5QY|5.0|Needed this movie for a class and it was great! Just know the disk is two-sided. It can lead to some confusion. There is also not a menu for you to chose from.
B004SC7B6M|5.0|This album packs a beautiful punch: half remorseful, half butt-kicking awesome. The energy level is higher than Within Temptation's other albums, so I recommend listening to some of the tracks to get a feel for it, especially if you're expecting &#34;more of the same.&#34; I personally like the increased energy in this album, so I'm giving it five stars.<br /><br />All of Within Temptation's music is great, so you should check out their other albums as well.
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|I recommend this book to couples married, engaged, or newly in their relationship. I even think this is good for singles.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|I was caught for awhile. Then I just got bored.  Typical Harlequin formula with a boatload of hype.  Seriously, I didn't finish it.  I really tried.  I wanted it to be GREAT.  I kept expecting something and finally gave up.
B000001FFR|5.0|To give you my version, I am a Megadeth blood fan, I consider Megadeth the best band in the planet, of all time, I took time to calculate the ratio of the songs that I like, it was 9/10. I tried to make a top 10 playlist, it ended up as a Top 62. I recently bought the \\"Big 4 Live DVD\\", and that's where I met Anthrax...<br /><br />I loved every single song from the Anthrax concert, they where great (not as great as Megadeth for me, but still amazing), and I listened it over and over until I decided it was time to buy some Anthrax (I hate digital music, I buy the CDs, DVDs and LPs that I love because f*** you, that's why) and so I did. I went to my closest music store, and took ALL the Anthrax available CD's. With only $7 bucks in my wallet I had to make a choice, and for some reason it ended up being Spreading the Disease. It was the right choice.<br /><br />I love every single song except Aftershot (not so much, it's just ok). My favorites are A.I.R., Lone Justice, The Enemy and Armed and Dangerous. I recommend this to anyone that loves Metal in general, great music. And Joey Belladonna in vocals is just priceless, that's a true metal voice. Though one thing that I did notice, what makes Anthrax so great isn't their solos (they're average), but their compositions, the music is beautiful itself, no need of amazing solos here.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Great movie for kids and adults. Many characters from back in the day that you probably forgot. Lots of humor
B008G8SFGO|5.0|I am going to ke ofep this short and sweet, this is a great KISS effort. Gritty and guitar driven this is probably top 5 of the KISS world.<br /><br />As usual, KISS does their best work in the beginning of any decade. This disc would have made a great follow up to \\"Revenge\\".  It harkens back to a time when Rock was the first thing on KISS's mind.  Unlike the last effort \\"Sonic Boom\\"  this album is not a collection of contrived songs attempting to sound like older KISS efforts.  This disc has a style that permeates throughout and really makes you look back and realize that KISS has not been this focused in a decade.<br /><br />This is the first attempt since they resumed the make-up and costumes that they have not just been reliving the past.  \\"Monster\\", like previous great KISS eforts; \\"Revenge\\" and \\"Creatures of the Night\\", is where KISS looks at the past few years and tosses it out the window and starts fresh with great results.<br /><br />If you like the one song here, you will like most of the disc. No KISS album has been this tight since \\"Rock and Roll Over\\" way back in it's prime.  This is a disc more meant for the fans of AOR classics like \\"I Want You\\" or \\"Hotter Than Hell\\".  No ballads nor overly anthemic attempts begging for radio play.  This is straight through rock.
B008I43DYU|4.0|Now this is what I call a useable product.  Big, Bold and easy on the eyes.  Good job !!!!!  carry on !!!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Once again makes a master piece It was very exciting making you think what's going to happen next . It shows you the other cabins in camp half-blood.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|I don't really watch much anime. But my daughter love these types of movies. She really enjoys this movie, I think she watched it at least 5 times within a weekend when she first got it (for xmas).
B004AP09CU|1.0|Giving this 1 star for feeling forced into spending $90 and $120 just to get the remastered CD.  I'm still waiting....
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This book was so good and I didn't want to stop reading it, but it was kind of depressing. I'd recommend it though!
B006AX6ONI|5.0|This was a great read. Mostly based from his blog posts, but a bit more organized. Easily read within an hour or two, but I usually pick it up and read bits and pieces from time to time for motivation.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I don't know much about it but my 5 year old grandson played it for 2 hours when I down loaded it and he loved it.
B0070UFMOW|5.0|I use this with both my iPhone and iPad mini and some Sennheiser HD380 Pro headphones plus an app that plays uncompressed FLAC files.  Try it; you might be amazed.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|I recommend this highly to anyone who likes a good psychological horror flick. One thing I saw coming was  Ellison Oswalt's(Ethan Hawke) reluctance and arrogance turned around and bit him in the ass. Also the 8MM films he kept watching were actually quite disturbing, they actually made me feel sad for these family's. The plot tied in nicely and the soundtrack solidly kept it all together. Ironically the music at the end when Ellison and his family are being chopped up, is by one of my favorite groups SunnO))))). The movie played great on my computer and I'm thinking about purchasing it on dvd. It's hard to find a good modern made horror flick now-a-days.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Oh man have I refrained from using wireless technology long enough due to fear of latency issues and wireless disconnections/interruptions. This headset feels absolutely no different than using a wired headset. The sound quality is amazing. I just got this headset a few days ago and still adjusting to the surround sounds because these earpieces are so large and spacious, it actually does make sounds more clear when you don't have anything pressing against your ears.<br /><br />There are two things I absolutely love about this headset:<br />1. No wires!<br />I don't feel \\"entrapped\\" or \\"entangled\\" to my computer as I do with wired headsets. I can sit in my chair, put this headset on, and spin forever without the risk of choking myself. I can also move my chair without running over any cords or getting cords caught in the wheels. Also don't have to worry about untangling the cords. Basically, all the cons of wired headsets are nonexistent with these. I even walk away from my computer and go outside forgetting I have these headsets on. Yes, it's THAT unnoticeable! I have yet to try playing music on my computer and see if I can still listen to it from outside while doing outside work as I listen to high-quality music. LoL.<br /><br />2. Voice morphing!<br />Can someone say prank calls? Haha. No I'm kidding. I'm trying to start up some video gaming series on YouTube involving commentary and some voice acting, and this voice morphing feature (that I didn't even know existed until the package arrived) just made my life soooo much easier. I can set up a very deep voice, or a voice of a 5-year-old on the fly without the hassle of audio editing which seems to fail pretty much all the time.<br /><br />Other Pros?<br />Well, you got superb build quality. It also makes it pretty heavy.<br />Comfortable to wear.<br />You got customizeable buttons (which I won't use)<br />Battery indicator (it can last a lot of hours in one charge)<br />It also has a battery-saving system where itwill automatically shut off when audio is absent for a period of time which helps prolong battery life.<br /><br />What about Cons?<br />Rechargeable batteries. This is a major con for ANY electronic device out there. Rechargeable batteries die over time no matter how well you treat them and when they die, your whole product is dead unless they allow replacements.<br />Powering on/off. The only con I have a slight complaint for is the power button because you have to turn on the headset every time you turn on your computer, otherwise the computer will default to it's usual audio system.<br /><br />People have mentioned audio cutting out or the headset disconnecting every so often. I haven't experienced this. Maybe it's because I have it plugged into the USB 3.0 port. If I'm gonna use a wireless device, I'd want to use the best/fastest port available so nothing risks slowing down the wireless communication. USB 3.0 ports are, I think, twice as fast as 2.0 ports and I'd recommend 3.0 for most wireless devices to ensure your device doesn't lag or disconnect. USB 2.0 ports might be only good for wireless keyboards.<br /><br />Review Update------<br /><br />So after having a few weeks to experiment I came to conclusion that by having the dongle plugged into the wired adapter makes the headset undetectable at times when you're trying to turn on the headset and the power light doesn't turn on after a while. But when the dongle is plugged directly into a USB port, the headset turns on without a hitch.<br /><br />As for disconnection issues people have mentioned, I still haven't experienced this, but when the headset is inactive for a period of time (or if there's no audio playing from the computer) the headset will automatically shut off which will help preserve its battery life. All you have to do is press the power button to reactivate it.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|The Martian was a great read! I'm not a big sci-fi girl by any stretch of the imagination, but I thoroughly enjoyed the book.  Most sci-fi is really heavy on the \\"fi\\"ction and not so much on the \\"sci\\"ence, but this book makes all the scenarios that Watney faces seem plausible.  Even though there are a lot of technical details and a nerd-festival of space terms and NASA babble, the author still manages to keep the story fast paced and full of suspense.  Plus, he makes the main character, Mark Watney, very likeable. Which is great, because you're basically hanging out with him for 527 sols.<br /><br />While I'm thrilled to have only had to pay $.99 for it, the book is worth much more. I'm glad I read it and would recommend it to anyone!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I enjoyed this book and hated when I had to put the book down. I recommend this book to others.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game. It has some glitches but its totally worth it. The only annoying thing is that I have to wait a long time to get the prizes I need
B0012FHGCW|2.0|Gets two starts for scenery.  Horrible acting.  Protagonist is portrayed as smug, self-satisfied, know-it-all by a B-movie actor.  I kept waiting for him to show some humility or enlightenment, but that never happened.  One-note performance.  The ending is the best part of the movie.<br /><br />I did not feel the same way about the book, which was excellent.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Great Addition to my Kindle I like google. Not too much I can say about an app. all i can say if I like the ability to have a web search tool at my disposal as I use google to answer a lot of questions for me.
B0039PPW60|4.0|Great value, has more noise in it that I would like, but can't complain at this price point. Only beef I have with this board is why did they not make the ALT 3-4 a subgroup instead? The larger 16 channel version of this board does indeed use a subgroup instead of ALT output. If you need a subgroup, this isn't for you. Signals are sent from a channel to ALT 3-4 by muting them.
0765334798|2.0|Not one of  my favorite Scalzi books .kinda rates the same as &#34;The Androids Dearm&#34;.<br /> plot was silly..Star Trek ??? Really.<br />Bring back more of John Perry's world of ....&#34;Old Man's War&#34;. Now that was great !!
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|excellent movie can watch it over and over again.. especially if you love ABBA's music.  a must see movie definitely
B007HACDLK|5.0|A great read. I love Vince Flynn.  He is a great writer of suspence and of mystery. A great thriller.
B00A8LYYI0|2.0|I can't begin to tell you how frustrating it was to watch \\"Revelation\\". There are just so many things wrong with it. I feel like nobody really cared about the project while they were making it. Everything that was good about the first film was stripped away in this sequel. At times it felt as though I was watching a direct-to-DVD movie. If I had to sum this movie up in one word it would have to be: unfocused. That could apply to almost every aspect of the film... including the acting, the directing, the script and the cinematography. I wanted to like it, I really did. I wanted to defend this movie, but sadly there is nothing redeemable here. So disappointing.
B005ZUR724|1.0|I've played this game for over a year and overall I have to say that it's not worth it. You now have to grind a lot more than you used to and the customer service is horrible. You will spend endless hours farming the same area/dungeon for little reward.
B001UGB1X8|3.0|Lived in the enviorment of that movie - just a bit unreal. However,'Tommy plays his usual role, does a good job as an actor but the script leaves much to be desired. Didn't hear the drawl of La.
B002RI9MZC|4.0|A combination of memoir, journal, novel, autobiography and a history of a tumultuous century and one action-packed but at many times tragic life.
B002RTBN9O|1.0|Believe it or not watched this film 2 time, could not believe it was so famous. The story of a group of<br />self centered, egotistical, selfish rich people was so juvenile and trite. What a waste of a great cast.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is actually a lot more fun than I thought it would be great time passer and the graphics are pretty nice for a game like this

B00AH8FTT2|5.0|More brilliancy from Sir Jeffrey.  Another very hard to put down book.  Didn't want it to end and could of screamed when the final page arrived.  No, you can't leave us hangling like this.... can't wait for the next one to pick up where lefted off.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|I honestly thought that this book would be predictable, but once again Nicholas Sparks has proved me wrong.  I couldn't put it down...I LOVE IT!!!!!
B000FCKGPC|3.0|If I wasn't already three books into this narrative I wouldn't have made it through this one.  I'm going to give the next in the series a quick test because I've already bought it.  George R.R. Martin seems to have lost his interest in the plot and instead fallen in love with his characters.<br /><br />Caitlin is alive?  Really?  Ridiculous.  I have no empathy for her given the way she judged everyone.<br /><br />The inter politic shtick is now beyond tiresome.  There is not a character within the group of those playing the 'game of thrones' that I find palatable that appears in this book with the possible exception of Tyrion.  Alas, Tyrion makes an early exit and does not reappear.  I wish this book could be skipped & I'm hoping the fifth makes that a worthwhile idea.  If George takes three years to publish the sixth I'm sure I will never crack the spine.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Best bond .......to date. I can't wait for the next instalment in the series. I thought it was a classy exit for M
B00710Z87M|5.0|enjoying the practical approach and the visualisations provided. it has given me good ideas on how to approach manifesting more effectively
B007REV4T8|5.0|I'm a Sean Connery fan, but I gotta tell you Daniel Craig has become my favorite 007.  He's believable.  His acts are not corny.
B006LA6IW2|5.0|Really like everything about it, the story, the added videos, everything. I am only sorry Chris cannot read this. RIP
1475143389|4.0|There is a lot of practical information in the book - really more of a booklet. Some of it was background and filler regarding weightlifting and nutrition advice. It crossed my mind that the author may have felt compelled to pad the booklet to make it seem more important. However, when he finally got to the specifics of weightlifting routines, I found myself motivated and determined to give them an honest try. I've been lifting weights for years, off and on, and my tendency is to keep adding reps and sets and new exercises, which unnecessarily complicates and lengthens each workout session and actually undermines my commitment to physical fitness. Michael Matthews convinced me I could do a whole lot more for myself by cutting my workout sessions to 45 minutes to 1 hour and by concentrating on specific, intense exercise routines, typically consisting three sets of heavy weights and in the range of 4-6 reps. I also found his discussion of nutrition, diet and supplements very insightful. I plan to start a cutting diet soon as it sounds solid and promising. I recommend &#34;BLS&#34; for a non-BS approach to weightlifting and nutrition.
B009GFEOY8|5.0|This is an awesome film for use in older SX-70 type Polaroid cameras. While not perfect, this is an experimental film that has been well stabilized for integral use and has a beautiful cool blue tone to the image, while still remaining fairly warm overall. It reminds me of Kodak Porta in terms of color rendering. Highly suggest for all applications!
B007EECSFA|3.0|It took a few chapters into the book for the story to capture my interest but when it did  I couldn't put it down. Although it's not a must read novel it is still a treat for us book lovers.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|If you like match 3 games you will enjoy this one. The play gets more challenging as you advance levels.
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|I thought it was a cruel joke at first, but this movie kept glitching off.  I even called my cable company just to make sure nothing was wrong with my internet.  I hope the problem is resolved before I watch it again.<br /><br />The movie istself was great.  My 3 year old laughed so much!
B0061QD82E|5.0|This is my daughter's favorite movie so far. The video quality is great and I couldn't have asked for anything better.
B000Z66RSS|5.0|all wrapped not broke absolutely awsome I have no complaints id recommend it to everyone<br />that I could its great
B005GFPZYK|2.0|An autobiography of a sniper. Some interesting sections. The language is nasty at times. I didn't finish the book. There are rants about his incompetent leadership.
B00BEPVAV8|3.0|I loved this game. The controls were simple, the graphics were sweet, and the game was overall addicting. However, this game caused my Kindle to FREEZE AND SHUT DOWN! I deleted the game for fear of viruses!
1439152799|2.0|As so many other reviewers commented as well--I loved two other books by this author and that is what drew me to this title when I saw it in my local library. Not only did the \\"mud man\\" idea not hold any appeal for me, the conflicting personalities of the three sisters set me on edge, especially when so many 'control freak' methods were applied by one of them. Actually it made me feel like screaming. And I could not find an ounce of respect for the so-called famous author father--even from the beginning of the story before his true character was revealed. It was such a drug-out story line that I can't even remember now what the long lost letter was about or if that detail was even given. The only good thing about the story was how Edie and her parents developed a closer relationship. I actually found Edie's part of the story to be much more interesting than the castle inhabitants and would have loved more details about her life and hopefully a new love that might have come about as a result of her involvement with the old castle.
B006I1OB0U|3.0|Whoever wrote the disc description didn't make things clear at all- this appears to be the second season &#34;Christmas Special&#34; broadcast here in the US in 2012, and it'll be in PAL format, not NTSC. If you buy the &#34;Original UK edition DVD/ Blu ray set(s) for season 2 you'll have it all in one great package!
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|Love Ellie. Heard her described once as the 'woman with a hummingbird in her throat' and thought it was so apt. Moody tunes great for an aching heart, with enough percussion to keep you moving. Lyrics can be indecipherable, but are often on point. &#34;Chase your love around a figure eight. I need you more than I can take. You promise forever and a day- and then you take it all away.&#34; Preach, girl.<br /><br />The great sort of album you can listen to on repeat, with favorite tracks that change depending on your mood. Yep, love it.
B008N2Z1L0|5.0|This album is a great addition to my collection of the Wallflowers music.  I listen to it on a daily basis right now.
B009A87ZQU|5.0|I had SERIOUS doubts about Daniel Craig in this role, but my concerns are long since dead. The new character that Craig brought to Bond was unmistakable. My review of this movie is that you can't get much better than this. Mads Mikkelsen was TREMENDOUS in King Arthur, and excellent here too. Eva Green could not have been more beautiful (I really LOVE the way they didn't airbrush the birthmarks and freckles off this girl to make her look more \\"perfect\\"; she was plenty perfect on her own). Sadly, the second two movies after this did NOT match up to these standards whatsoever....  Casino Royale had: the BEST two Bond girls in a LONG time, EXCELLENT banter back and forth between Bond and Vesper Lynd, the right amount of violence and arrogance from Bond (a la Connery) and BY FAR the best script in a Bond movie since Goldeneye. Everything about this film was better than many before it, and certainly better than Quantum or Skyfall. Skyfall might has well have been any modern day violent thriller, nothing new about the script whatsoever. I was quite disappointed. Last but not least, the intro sequence with the incomparable Chris Cornell on vocals blows you away every time. Not only the music but the very creative intro piece with the hearts and spades and the villains was AWESOME... A far cry from the lackluster song by Adele on Skyfall. I really hope they can pull off the same entertainment and creativity again with a new Bond movie. They must have been really HUNGRY (all of them) to make a movie THIS GOOD..  hope they can do it again!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love the hidden tape so you can see what you added in the past.  it is just a perfect simple calculator
B002V0GZ9M|5.0|Keanu can't act, and I still love this film. Identify so strongly with Sandra's character. The download from Amazon itself was easy, good quality, great price.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|This is a great companion to Stargate SG-1!!!!  It's great sci-fi that's presented as if it could be reality.  Highly Recommend.
B009N0CYWA|1.0|This was the worst HD Amazon Instant Video purchase I have made. Very poor quality on my big screen TV. I must warn other customers to purchase HD Life of Brian on disk rather than through Amazon Instant Video.<br /><br />There are no refunds for digital purchases... but I always look on the bright side of life...
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much that I found myself staying up way too late reading it and picking it up first thing in the morning!
B005LAIHSQ|3.0|Walking into this movie I was excited to see it though because it was something new. I wished that an English actress would ahve been cast as Snow White instead of Kristen Stewart who sucks at faking a British accent. If they'd just left her with her normal voice I think she'd have been a lot better off. I've never thought she was a great actress but you can tell she tried really hard in this movie. Honestly none of the actors brought their A game to me in this movie they were all just ok. You didn't get to know the characters as much as I would have liked because the movie felt a little rushed to get to the end battle between Snow White and Ravena which was short lived.<br /><br />It was an interesting story because it was something different. I enjoy this movie every now and then but it's not one of my favorites. Hemsworth did well and I can see why they want to make a spin off movie based on his character and not Snow White because the producers wanted to avoid all the drama that went on between the director and Stewart's affair. This is still a fun movie if you're into the fantasy genre but don't expect to be blown away by actors it's the story line, visual effects, and scenery that will enchant most viewers.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|AMAZING. All that I can say. However, I need more words so I'll just have to keep rambling on, and yeah.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|Good, interesting story. Horrible, horrible proofreading. Syntactical errors, grammatical errors, and simply wrong words (e.g.: \\"course\\" for \\"coarse,\\" \\"would\\" for \\"wood,\\" and - most egregiously - \\"then\\" for \\"than.\\"). There are so many they kept jolting me out of the story. Let's hope the remaining books are treated more kindly than this one.
B00144VBBS|5.0|No matter what you listen to of Toby Keith it's good. All types of music listeners would like his music.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I read this along with Gary Taubes 'Why We Get Fat'.  Lets just say both are mind blowing but make so much more sense why it is such a struggle with losing weight and why so many people are obese, have diabetes, autism even, than ever before.<br /><br />I personally have stopped eating wheat for an entire month and I felt great, not only that but my skin cleared up!! This has been ongoing issue for over 20 years for me.  I have suffered from acne since I was at least 12 years old and nothing has ever completely cleared it.  One night I had some fancy pizza because I figured it couldnt hurt.  Well it did and I got 3 huge nasty zits that took over a week to go away.  NOt regular pimples but nasty ones that actually look they are infected.  I vowed to never eat wheat again.  Id rather have clear skin that bread.<br /><br />Also my stomach is significantly flatter! I can also start to see the ab muscles I have been working so hard for!<br /><br />I am also not hungry all the time anymore.  I mean I was really bad.  Constantly starving and thinking about what will I eat consumed my life.  Now its gone and I can last much longer without food.  I feel like I got free from the wheat devil.
B00BBQXQFI|3.0|a little boring grand children lost interest after the first 30 minutes.  would not recommend you buy this movie in the future.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|This is a good little sharpener. It does have a rather shallow angle but it also gives you a nice cutting edge. I'm kind of crazy about my knives being sharp and this helps out.... Haven't tried the serration tool yet but I will update when I do.

B0083EY9EI|5.0|I love this girl's voice.  The entire album is good from start to finish, it will not disappoint.  I cannot wait to see her live.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|totally an adult movie, a little confusing and hard to follow the core of the movie.  NOT something I would buy on DVD
B009UX2YAC|4.0|dear person who wants to download this,<br />  subway surfers has nothing bad in at all! this is such a fun game! its like u can get addicted in a good way.<br />so go ahead and download this game!
B008C40218|4.0|I'm totally frustrated with this CD: I really like it, but try as I might, I can't pin a label on Calexico or categorize them. What do they sound like? Once again, I can't adequately pinpoint a certain sound or commpare them to any other bands. Calexio weave a variety of musical styles on this album, creating a mesmerizing, enchanting, daring, and very listenable album. Some tunes hooked me right away, and other took time to sink in. I like the fact that the sounds on this album aren't stuck in one gear, but shift and accelerate at random. These guys are taking chances and the efforts pay off. True musical artistry at work. I hadn't heard an album by Calexico in over 12 years, but after this impressive outing, I think I need to go back and immerse myself in their other recordings. Highly recommended.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Wonderful movie!  Quick delivery!!  Highly recommend for those who like awesome animation and a great story. Two thumbs up on this one.
B000I9YLTE|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies. Brings back great memories. Everyone over the age of 18 should see it at least 10 times!
B0095P29EG|5.0|The whole family loved Thor! Even my 4 year old son wanted to watch it again! Overall this was a great movie!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I bought this book after I saw the movie, which I thought was one of the best I have seen in many years. I can honestly say that this book held its own to the movie. Each had slightly different plots, but both were equally enjoyable and offered unique perspectives into Pat's life. Loved it!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is now my go to calculator rather than the one that sits atop my desk! Big easy to read numerals and has all the essential functions I need.  Great for balancing the checkbook!
B001K3KK0Q|5.0|Loved this old movie and looking forward to the new one with Leonardo. Robert Redford is so dreamy and Mia farrow innocent acting.
B00274EYKY|1.0|The movie was pointless and depressing. He was given many opportunities to change his life, but he choose the destructive path. I regret renting it. I should have been paid to watch this movie.
B004QX07G4|3.0|As much as I adore Ellen, this book was little bland to me. Her style of writing was certainly different, but not very likable in my opinion. After a while, I didn't want to keep reading. However, there were more than a few moments in the book that made me laugh and smile, and that was what I expected the book to do. I really would have liked the audiobook version. I think her voice adds so much humor that the writing just lacks. It could have been a lot better, definitely does not contain the stellar humor Ellen is known for...
B00BL5YQKS|4.0|Clearly this first episode is setting up for what whill be a power struggle between the gutsy, gun-sielding Cop on the Beat, and the suit-wearing administrator who seems Justice in addition to Law enforcement.  Good starter.
B00000CQJZ|5.0|So very English and so very Hitchcock.  Amazing how the film industry evolved during Hitch's lifetime.  Don't be put off if the first scene is a bit hard to follow.  It might take a moment to adjust to black and white, accents, and a director who caters to thinking viewers.  Don't forget to spot Alfred's cameo.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This game is super fun and addictive. Once you get it, you never want to stop playing! I recommend it to anyone who loves to play games.
B00ATP24NW|5.0|I cannot rave enough about this CD. The quality of the music is so good - from the vocals to the instrumentals to the lyrics - everything is stellar and totally on point. Imagine Dragons is now one of my favorite artists. ABSOLUTELY recommend this CD to anyone who loves some good rock tunes.
B0026IUXO2|5.0|What magnificent acting on the part of every single person.  The story, of course, is well known, but having it btought to life so vividly is a treat.  WATCH IT!

B007SGM084|5.0|After reading all the negative ratings, I was unsure at first if I even wanted to get into the series, but after reading the sample, I was hooked and bought the trilogy. All I wanted was a book with romance, and that's what I got plus more. I found it hard to put the book down once I started. To be honest, I was expecting porn in the form of a book, but surprisingly there was way more to the story. Once I got towards the end of the third book, I actually started reading slower because I didn't want it to end. I thoroughly enjoyed this trilogy.
0385349947|1.0|This is not a book. It is a promotional tool that has been built on her TED talk. The publisher is hard-pressed to make a book because it is only 172 pages. I can watch the basics online for free, so why would I, or for that matter, anyone pay to read this book? The pages after 172 are merely notes. What a ripoff.
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|Just difficult enough to make you think, but not difficult to the point that you are wandering around clueless. I really enjoyed playing.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I enjoyed it. This book hooked me from the first page. I will watch the movie and continue with the second book.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|I have wanted to see this movie,Life of Pi for a while. When I saw it was available on Amazon we decided to rent it. We enjoyed it. The scenery as well as the story is beautiful. I would recommend it.Very interesting story.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|As someone who always loved dinosaurs and always wanted a decent JP game, I was excited to get this. However, as you can see, I haven't given it five stars. The reason for this is that the game is altogether too linear. I suppose this is normal for this kind of Farmville-esque game, but for me, the game could be improved if you didn't know what was in the dna you just found, but instead of this being the case, you actually get a mission BEFORE you have even found the dna, telling you to breed that dino, and additionally, the dinos you get in the game follow the same list as the list in your market view, most of which are easy to identify (what dino fan wont recognise pachycephalosaurus for instance).<br /><br />You always know what's next; expand, find dna, spend a few hours gathering and collecting gold, buy the next dino, level up, etc. It's a circle and the only way you relly step out of it is by decorating your park and moving stuff around to your liking. To that end you can move everything for free and roads are totally free. That's a nice bonus.<br /><br />For what it is, an attractive, involving timesink, it does what it says on the tin and you wont be too disappointed.<br /><br />If you came for a great JP game, this isnt it, but if you came for an above average app game that will keep you hooked for hours, this is the one.

B00AZL3PBK|4.0|like it a lot.  Mario brothers for the kindle.  pretty easy to play,  not to sensitive to make it tough to play. nice to just pick up and play.  you can play for a quick five minutes, or loose yourself for a few hours.
6305907145|1.0|After I watched this movie I bought the book because this USA version of movie didn't fit with my concept of Jane Austen's novels in style or topics. She didn't deal with politic and only mentioned the plight of women in her  time in passing. When I read the book I was right the novel was set in 18th century England, Fanny Price the daughter of a poor sister was sent to live with her aunt & uncle Sir Thomas & Lady Bertram at Mansfield Park. There she was educated & brought up to be a ladies maid/companion to her Aunt who had 2 daughters & sons near Fanny's age. She was mild mannered & shy, intelligent but reserved & lived in the shadows of her husband hunting cousins. The book did mention her uncle & cousin, Tom Bertram, going off to the Indies but it didn't say if it was he West or East Indies. The novel never discussed politic of the day or slavery. Also while Fanny was relative she didn't have the same rights & privileges or flights of fancy as her cousins. Fanny would never have contradicted anything her uncle said or been involved in a discussions, let alone about politics. It simply wasn't done, not even Lady Bertram or her female cousins would have read about or been involved in political discussions in 18th century England. The only time Fanny refused to follow her uncles wishes was concerning accepting Henry Crawford's marriage proposal. Her refusal without explanation got her sent back to her parents as a reminder of where she came from, until she was needed again at Mansfield Park.<br />Mansfield Park the book is an 18th century love story between classes. This movie tries to make Fanny Price a late 19th century loud mouth American suffragette without class or reserve. Aside from the setting & the character's names it has little semblance to the novel. To me if you are going to make a movie using a book title and author as the movie title, the book should be recognizable in the movie.  The USA movie version of Mansfield Park does an injustice to Jane Austen and fans of her novels.<br />If you like Jane Austen novels I'd skip this movie and opt for one produced by the BBC. All of the BBC Jane Austen movies seem to be a more accurate representation of the novels. I had seen other versions of Mansfield Park and I was appalled at the liberties Hollywood took with this one
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|I've never taken the time to write a review before, but no other series has had me hooked like this one.  If you haven't seen it I'd buy the series from Amazon.  I can't remember ever being this moved by a t.v. show.  Your heart will race on this journey.

0385349947|4.0|Okay, I started a discussion about this book on Amazon.com discussions called \\"A New Era For Women in the Workplace?​\\" which has received interesting and controversial replies. Feel free to join the discussion. Given that the discussion has seemed to cause a stir, I decided I'd post a review of this book.<br /><br />Let me start by saying that Sheryl Sandberg's success certainly qualifies her as being knowledgeable about the plight of women in the workplace. Ms. Sandberg is worth millions, and she has had the experiences and education to write on this topic. So in ways, her success speaks for itself.<br /><br />She also describes the workplace enviornment for women from her first-hand experiences. It doesn't mean that EVERY woman experiences the same inequality that Ms. Sandberg describes, but it does happen. Ms. Sandberg also appears to try to prepare women for leadership roles in the workplace.<br /><br />As I said in the discussion I satrted (see first paragraph) some women opt for in-home work which is highly lucrative also, and the general guide for that work is [[ASIN:1479780243 Make Money at Home: A Quick Guide: Special Edition]]. So there is an option for women who may choose not to challenge the unstable workplace enviornment.<br /><br />Ms. Sandberg does a good job of guiding, and preparing women for the workplace, and that is why I gave her book four stars.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|Simple premise, start as an infection in one person, and mutate the infection using DNA that pops up (or is randomly granted) to increase the ability to spread, the way it spreads, or make it harder to cure you.  If you win, by killing every human on the planet, then you'll unlock something that will help you in future games, or you can buy packs that will unlock other types of infection, or mutations to the DNA of your infection.  Lots of stuff to unlock will keep you playing the game for a long time.<br /><br />Each type of infection (virus, bacteria, mold, etc) behaves differently, so each game takes a different strategy, how you choose to spread your infection also changes your strategy, so the game has more depth than you'd think when you initially start. It's also very realistic in how infections spread and change.<br /><br />Once the humans start to research a cure, it becomes a race against time, can you mutate your infection fast enough to stay ahead of the human race, or will the cure be found and eliminate your infection?<br /><br />Well worth your time if you like some depth to your strategy games.  Each game lasts about 30 minutes on normal speed, but if you crank up the speed you can get on in in about 10 minutes.

0062014536|4.0|I always love Delirium Trilogy so I absolutely was thrilled when i finally received the book. but like others said, it could have got  a better ending. The ending is really disappointing, but most chapters are as awesome as the first two books. And you definitely wanna finish the whole story after reading the first two.<br />The short story of Alex is really wonderful, I love it so much.<br />So overall it deserves a 3 or 4 rating.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Most Bond movies have an all too well known plot/theme. This bond went in a whole different direction, raising the bar for bond movies. I love all the old bond movies, especially those with Sean Conery, but I think Daniel Craig has become my favorite Bond of all time. Yes I think he is the BEST Bond!!!

B003TSEEDY|4.0|I liked he movie so I decided to read the book and I found it much better than the movie. I liked the way the story is told through letters Charlie (the main character) writes to somebody (?), but his personality is what drags you into the book. It is impossible not to like him since he is a screwed up, shy, innocent kid who has lots of love (in very many different forms) for people around him. It is certainly the same literary architecture of “The Catcher in the Rye”, but I see no shame in stealing from the best…

B00B23O96A|3.0|From a music historical standpoint Eric Clapton's career over the past 45 years has certainly been instinctive and innovative as well as beguilingly deceptive and indolence at times. Certainly from his inception with The Yardbirds, John Mayall, Cream and Derek And The Dominoes his solidity and abilities as a guitarist were certainly pure and valiant. His remarkable prowess as a blues purist and acumen with his guitar chops were definitive along with his admirable proselytizing of that genre. Clapton's origin might had made his reputation as a guitarist, but ironically he owes his 'stardom' to his voice which unfortunately hasn't always made for quality albums, which brings us to his new cd 'Old Sock'. Clapton certainly goes for diversity here and the inclusion of an array of musical forms might be a welcome for new fans or a displeasing continuity with old ones who still desire and hope for 'God' to make a comeback. Well, for the most part old fans will still have to wait. 'Old Sock' may not be the mediocre 'Pilgrim', but it's also not '461 Ocean Boulevard' which this album is being misleadingly compared to. If anything, Clapton strives for the usual variety mode here with reggae, r&b, blues, and jazz standards, but the songs are remakes and have been done before. Clapton's versions of 'Born To Lose', 'Goodnight Irene', and 'All Of Me' pale in comparison to Billie Holiday's or Ray Charles versions.  On the other hand Clapton's version of Peter Tosh's 'Further On Down The Road' is a bullseye and 'Gotta Get Over' is a good rocker. In some ways 'Old Sock' is exactly what you expect from Clapton. He certainly has been in a comfort zone and though 'Old Sock' may be a labor of love for songs he chose as inspirations you feel a magnitude of a letdown since Steve Winwood, Steve Gadd, Paul McCartney, Chaka Kahn, Willie Weeks, Doyle Bramhall II all are involved to name a few. Regardless, If you are contemplating spending time in a elevator or Hospital waiting ward 'Old Sock'is for you. For the remainder of some who are anticipating 'God' to return you will have to settle in the meantime for a new Pope. I would suggest picking up Robin Trower's new cd ' Roots and Branches' for combustion intensity.
B00BSBY38A|4.0|I enjoyed life of pi and the movie has great visual effects and story, it is worth it to rent it
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I absolutely cried through most of this book. Jodi Picoult's writing made me feel like any one of those characters could've been me. I felt Emily's anguish and Chris's helplessness. I have children of my own that I would lay my life down for and friendships that would rival that of Gus and Mel. Having said that, I couldn't put this book down, regardless of the roller coaster of emotions that I felt. It has been such a long time since I have felt so passionately about the characters in a book. Very very well done!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Having waited so long for new developments to the storyline, I was absolutely riveted by this book. I can hardly wait for the next one.
B004KKXMSI|5.0|One of my all time favorite trilogies. The special effects still stand up to today's technology. You can't go wrong in buying this set.
B008YI91HS|5.0|It always amazes me how well this movie was put together. For how old it is, it seems that the movie still had the effects of a modern time. It's been a while since watching it, but well worth the time.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Great show! I would recommend it to anyone. I'm very happy I went back to watch it.  It's a great show overall.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Fun for adults, might be tough for children.  Fun &quot;find it&quot; game.  Interesting story line with interactive mini games.  Controls could be better.
B009EANE3M|5.0|One of my favorite albums at the moment.  I have my favorite songs of course: Hall of Fame, If You Could See Me Now, No Words, but the whole album is just fantastic.  I have read reviews of people complaining about the rapping, but it isn't annoying or grating at all. I dislike rap, but don't mind the parts of the album where they do rap. They put a great deal of emotion into their songs and draw you in. Check them out! I guarantee you'll love them!
B008YI9CWW|4.0|It's been a long while since watching this movie. It's a fun one. If you like Jurassic Park this movie is a continuation. It has the same story idea just different setting.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I cannot WAIT for the next season... Amazing casting, characterization, plot, writing, setting... Finally, a show that relies on wit, depth, humor, drama and amazing acting rather than playing to the lowest common denominator!
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Cute matching game. Fun helping the tree people rebuild their village. Enjoying the extra challenge of figuring out the game's physics as the blocks do not always drop where I expect.
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|I purchased this movie from my grand daughters.  They loved it and watch it over and over again.  I would recommend it for other girls who are into monster high books, dolls & other products.

B0095P3ULC|5.0|Very full of action with a good back story with Sam's new girl friend.  Would recommend this movie to anybody.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Before viewing this documentary, I believed there was a commonality between the food I consumed and my inability to lose weight and poor health. I was curious whether this would be a propaganda type movie. Afterwards, my belief has been proven to be correct. In just my lifetime the food we eat has gone through a change that our bodies are not able to deal with. It makes me ill to think that its our government and a few conglomerate companies that just don't care about American's health. Yea I know, its all about making more money. I applaud the few that would put their livelihood on the line to get the truth out and pray that our methods in growing and producing food will go back to the way it was done over 50 years ago. Thanks for the education and now at least I can modify the way I eat so that it won't have such a terrible effect on my body. I will share this with family and friends. I recommend all adults to  watch as it impacts everyone.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Im so glad i listened to the other reviews and bought this game! its a lot of fun and very addicting. it makes time fly by. take a chance and get it! :)<br />-

B00846REIS|3.0|After reading Fifty shades and then reading this- I wasn't impressed. It's a copycat of Fifty Shades of Grey. Not an original piece.
B009KHDT0C|1.0|When I was in high school I used to rush home to watch Dark Shadows. It was one-of-a-kind for its time. Sexy vampires? Even sexier werewolves? Time shifting? Poor production values? Cringe-worthy performances? Check, check and double-check. It was delicious.<br /><br />One doesn't expect remakes to be slavish to the original material, but the changes made for this version seem peculiarly ineffective. None of the menace or mystery of the original Barnabas is in evidence. Depp's Barnabas has become a creepy CEO, counting bags of coins and building up the family corporation. With his focus on birthing hips and demolishing his business rivals, he's a be-caped Mitt Romney in mime face. He strides here and there during the day(?) or cutely naps in appliance boxes. All the family knows he's a 200-year-old vampire. His finger-wiggling hypnotic spells seem oddly short-term. He's afraid of lava lamps and Karen Carpenter.<br /><br />The cast is fabulous, but the performances run the gamut from wooden to stiff. When Michelle Pfeiffer's character is lifeless and Helena Bonham Carter's is merely drab and dumpy, there's something wrong. The opening scenes of Barnabas as a lad in the 18th century are captivating, but as soon as we enter the present the film falls flat. The climax is typical for films these days: designed to please tween boys, none of whom would see this in the first place.<br /><br />And don't blink or you'll miss the appearances of four of the original cast members entering Collinwood for the party. Poor Jonathan Frid died shortly before this was released, most likely from embarrassment.<br /><br />I read the reviews when the movie came out but finally had to watch it anyway. I wanted to like it even a little, but just couldn't.
0307592731|2.0|Cheryl Strayed is a capable writer and as I finished the first few chapters I became a fan.  I began recommending the book to my friends and family.  Her description of her mother dying of cancer was beautifully written and hit like a gut punch.  I thought, wow, this writer has potential.<br /><br />But as I progressed through the book I felt a gnawing sense that this was not a work of pure fact, and prone to flights of fancy and embellishment.  The dialog seemed contrived and wooden at times as the book wore on.  Her apparent desire to saddle up with just about any guy she bumped into seemed curious at first, began to wear thin later, and was off-putting by the end.  Some encounters read like more a cheap Harlequin romance novel than reality.  By the time she encounters bow hunters on the Oregon Crest Trail, she lost me.  They admire her sinewy legs under her tight jeggings (I'm embellishing for effect here).  They're hiking for the day but they're carrying huge backpacks.  They've each consumed a six pack of Pepsi but they're dehydrated and disoriented.  They leave but one of them returns to leer at her and accuse her of lying about where she was going to camp.  As I read the scene I felt like I was watching Burt Reynolds in Deliverance, \\"You got a nice mouf\\".  Like someone that's told you a string of faintly troubling white lies, the stink of poor credibility finally overwhelmed me.  I got the sense that she created plot devices and embellished stories as a means to punctuate her experiences north of the California border.<br /><br />I've hiked much of the Oregon and Washington Pacific Crest Trail system.  So I'm familiar with what it's like to be on the trail for 3-4 weeks at a time.  And there are elements of Strayed's book that resonated.  The contrast between what you *think* you'll be doing - sleeping soundly under the stars, and constantly staring in wonder at spectacular vistas, versus what you actually do - stare at the trail or your trail-mate's boots asyou watch for every root and rock that threatens to trip you up.  The monotony of long distance hiking.  Spending the day slogging to the top of a ridge, only to immediately lose the altitude dropping down the other side.  The morning ritual of hoisting \\"The Stone\\" (\\"Monster\\" for Cheryl) up onto your still-sore shoulders.  The curt efficiency with which you learn to set up and break down camp each day.  The day to day management of your feet.  The search for potable water.<br /><br />But her account does raise questions too.  How do you hike the length of the Oregon Crest Trail and not mention mosquitos?  Why is it that Strayed primarily discusses the parts of the trail that are accessible by car: Crater Lake, Ollalie Lake, Elk Lake, Jefferson Park, Timberline Lodge?  How in the freaking world do you hike down the Eagle Creek Trail without a mention of Twister Falls, Tunnel Falls, and Punchbowl Falls?!  Holy crap, this is one of the most amazing sections of trail in the Pacific Northwest.  Hop, skip, jump and Oregon is done.  As if Ms. Strayed was struggling with how to wind this thing down, or perhaps she hitched her way around portions of the trail in Oregon too?<br /><br />There are about a half-dozen recurring motifs on the trail: her desire for sex, the admiration of others as they heft her Monster backpack or marvel at her bravery, reflections on her childhood, her poor money management at drop-box sites and her abused feet. I've lost toenails to running and hiking, but Cheryl's toenail count and the way that they seem to come off, like Jeff Goldblum's ear in The Fly, began to feel artificially injected.  And like the other recurring motifs, seem perfunctory and dropped in to spice up the monotony of the trail.<br /><br />Only Ms. Strayed knows for sure how much of the book is Pants On Fire and how much is Mostly True.  And, in the end, I guess that wouldn't have mattered much if it had led to a compelling conclusion.  Disappointingly, though, we never learnhow she went from a self-abusive, impulsive life of sex, \\"Riding the Dragon\\" experimentation with heroin, and anger at her upbringing, to living in a happy, stable marriage with children in Portland, Oregon.  The last two pages breeze through that transformation in the same way the movie, The Abyss, closes (the alien ship rises to the surface, Ed Harris proclaiming that he should've died of decompression sickness but, \\"it must be something the aliens did\\" and he's ok.  Hooray, the world is saved).<br /><br />After chapters of build up we learn that life is what it is and Cheryl lives happily ever after.  The End.

1885167776|5.0|I just finished reading the e-book version.  This book is a must read no matter what business you are in. It changed my thinking on so many topics, I am re-reading it chapter by chapter again, more slowly!  I just ordered copies for my entire team.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|This book is very creative with well written and surprising events. For me, however, it lacked what I most desire from good fiction:  insights into our world and beings. I was relieved  when it was over.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|I have wanted this series since the show ended and let me say awesome just awesome and the bonus features are really great I recommend it to anyone who likes the Gilmore girls its worth every penny!
0805095535|5.0|Once again, Paul Auster does not let his readers down.  In another of his non-fiction masterpieces, Auster creates a personal memoir that is applicable to every living human being.  In an interesting use of literary license, Auster uses the 2nd person format throughout his book.  He refers to himself as \\"you\\" rather than I or me.  In a truly intimate personal essay, Auster recounts his own life and puts down on paper most of the things that have gone wrong throughout his 64 years of life so far.  Yet, he uses himself and the incidents of his experience primarily as a vehicle to allow him to discuss the `business of living' and how life imposes its will upon every human being.<br /><br />By telling his tale, Auster conveys to the reader the manner in which the mind and the body react to events that occur, primarily randomly, throughout the process of going through life.  Yet rather than just telling his story, he uses his exceptional powers of literary expertise to analyze those incidents and generalize those experiences, feelings and reactions so as to illustrate how all people go through similar processes and experiences.  Thus he creates a virtual manual which exemplifies, in his unique and insightful manner, how people do meet the challenges that life deals out to them.  His personal experiences are thereby turned into generalized examples of the way in which life unfolds for everyone.  He uses his own life and his own memories as the vehicle to transmit to the reader the manner in which people may, can and do react to the events of a lifetime.  Auster is brilliant in his exegesis of his own life, both the painful and the pleasurable, to exhibit a perspective that is unique and rare, yet applicable to virtually any thoughtful reader.<br /><br />Auster prognosticates that the rest of his life shall be the `winter of his life' yet nonetheless, he borrows from Joseph Joubert in stating that \\"the end of life is bitter.\\"  Yet, \\"One must die lovable (if one can)\\".  Auster has achieved two things here.  He has stated his intent to `die lovable' if in any way it is possible.  And, he has also answered the question so beautifully set to music by \\"The Beatles\\" when they asked \\"Will you still need me, will you still feed me, when I'm 64?\\"  In Auster's case, a slight modification is perhaps apropos, and the question should probably be \\"Will you still need me, will you still READ me, when I'm 64?\\"  The answer to that question is a resoundingly appreciative \\"YES!\\"
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|amazing continuation of Jackson's Middle earth..<br />I strongly recommend this product to anyone.<br /><br />You won't be sorry that you bought it.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|not a bad app needs some work tends to close app while playing whitch can get annoying at times but still very cute and fun to play
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is one of the best books ever because it was nice to be one of the people to read it on the kindle fire
B0002TJGQS|5.0|Cheaper than the dollar store but more reliable than no name brands. Took a long time to receive, but well worth it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really wasn't impressed with the previews for this series and didn't think that I would care for it. But I  do read a lot and so many people love this book that I decided I would give it a shot. I am hooked :)  bring on two and three.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|This book was awesome because it was a great experience to read the second book of the diary of a wimpy kid on the kindle fire I hope you enjoy it
0062014536|2.0|I too was disappointed with the ending. It was a waste of my time and money. She needs to write a book 4 with a better ending - and make it free.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Enjoyed reading the book.  A nice romance that just melts your heart. Cant wait to read more of the books.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|omg, i love this keyboard. i just discovered flow, after using swiftkey for years. duh. now, if they could figure out how to make slide-delete work WITH flow i'd give it 6 stars. seriously, i'd find a way...
1885167776|5.0|If you agree that time is your most precious asset, and how you spend that time is important, this book is a must-read. Learn the compelling research behind why multitasking is the lie of today's world, and how to achieve your highest success focusing on one thing at a time. Learn the focusing question to ask each morning or hour, and how to make it happen at last. The section on forming habits is worth reading three times. You'll be fascinated, sad, and smiling throughout this book, as the life-truths resonate with you - at least I was. I am on my third reading. You'll also enjoy the 'big-ideas' section that may just get you thinking about your life in a whole new way. Once you are a few pages in, the idea that success is sequential starts to make sense. Whether you are looking at new ways to feel energized and achieving more with your family, or whether you want world-domination in your business, or just a way to feel less stressed and more fulfilled at the end of the day, I highly recommend this book - watch out, it'll be the #1 business book this year, read it first so you can understand the ideas before your friends and competitors do!
B0055QYKQO|1.0|My primary components on this board:<br />AMD FX™ 8350 8-core 4.0 GHz<br />60GB Corsair Force Series 3 SSD<br />16GB  G.SKILL Sniper Series DDR3 1866 (4x 2GB)<br /><br />Pros:<br />-After flashing the BIOS to the latest release (F9 at the time, F10a is still a beta), I was able to get my 1866 memory to run at 1600. (The BIOS it came with clocked it at 1333). Flashing the BIOS with the downloadable @BIOS utility was a breeze.<br />-All the ports that I've used work.<br />-I like the look of it. Gunmetal blacks and grays really do make it seem like an &#34;Ultra Durable&#34; motherboard.<br />-It's stable, and has all the options you'd want to to overclock (which I don't.)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The BIOS is less intuitive than my old ASUS motherboard.<br />-USB support during POST is touchy (making entering the BIOS set up frustrating). I have an older keyboard with a split end so it can be either USB or PS/2, but that means I have to drag out another device while trouble shooting.<br />-There's a completely unexplained lag between the POST screen and the Windows 8 loading screen. It shows a blank screen with a blinking cursor, then a screen that says &#34;Loading operating system&#34; both for about 5 seconds each. I'm running a SSD build, and I'm this annoying sequence is slowing down my reboots. I've tried IDE and AHCI modes, and disabled and removed everything but the SSD, and still those 2 screens plague me. I've upgraded the firmware for my drives, all the drivers, and have the latest chipset. There's no &#34;Quick Boot&#34; option for this motherboard, and I doubt that would fix it anyway, since nothing else I attempted made 1 second of difference to those screens.<br /><br /> My wife inherited my old ASUS M4A785-M Motherboard running a Phenom II X2 555 Black Edition Callisto 3.2 GHz, unlocked to 4 cores. (Both purchased from Amazon.) I also upgraded her to a SSD drive and Windows 8. Now, that 2+ year old rig boots in about half the time my current one does,and the sole culprit is THIS motherboard. (Hers barely shows the POST screen, and you see the Window's loading for half a second before it's up and running.)<br /> After doing some research online, I've found out that this is a big issue with various Gigabyte motherboards, and the fix that works for most people (setting the SSD/HDD as the 1st boot device) does nothing for me.<br /><br />I've had this board for over 4 months now, and I wish I would have stuck with ASUS (the maker of my previous two MOBOs which had lightning quick boots.) I would send it back, at this point, if I could. What's the point of having AMD's best processor and a SSD drive if I can't even have boot-time bragging rights? Also, I'd prefer something that's a full UEFI rather than BIOS, anyway.
B00BESM14U|4.0|Great movie but i guessed the ending about halfway thru. At some points it drags but its an all around good movie.
B0020M99LC|4.0|met expectations!<br />also, the streaming went smoothly, no re-buffers, good viewing experience.<br /><br />(now I have to fill the words up to be able to submit......:( )
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Anything I want to save, recipes, classroom ideas, shopping lists. I have it all whenever and wherever I need it. The best thing about it is you can sync it with all your devices.
B005LAII80|4.0|this movie is kind of corny, but the effects are cool.  I watched this first in 2d, and decided that I liked the movie enough to see it again in 3d, so I purchased this bluray- I have a 65&#34; dlp television.<br /><br />Again the movie is very entertaining- the scenes where they take slo-mo are awesome, and we noticed way more effects that were designed for 3d, like when dredd punches one guy's voicebox in.<br /><br />Anyway, a nice entertaining (albeit gory at times) movie that makes you appreciate the modern world.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I never really read this supernatural stuff, but my daughter was way into all this books. So when she was done, I decided I would read them. I am glad I did. I didn't want to put them down. I have read them three times and will read them again. I enjoyed the movies, but books are better.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|This movie was excellent and it addressed moral issues.  Denzel Washington did indeed give an oscar performance.  The crash landing sequence was so believeable it made me very nervous.  Overall a great movie.
B004U8VWLE|2.0|The movie was just okay. I don't think it needed to be as dark or as provocative as it was. I do think it did a good job portraying the pressers associated with the dance industry.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love how you go to different places. It is so addictive. You have to get it. I just love the game!!!
B005MMY534|4.0|They have trouble keeping the story lines unique.  It gets to be repetitive.  After a couple shows we all know who the bad ones are.  They should go on to something else.
B006KX3GXO|1.0|I got this app and if you look carefully you can see in the top left corner of the kindal ia a small circle that looks like a camera. Its not! don't get if you have a kindal.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|It is amazing  that  the  world still has.  These  same<br />Issues.  We. Still  over. Extend. Our. Military and  we still. Do not<br />Protect our education,our.  Mothers. And children.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|If is a wonderful series and worth watching twice.  There are so many characters and plot lines it is hard to keep them straight.  The locations are wonderful.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this is the best app I have so worth $6.99<br />. but survival craft is way better for a better price.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This is a great game but could you add a restore purchases. I would really enjoy this game more if there was that button.
B006O6F932|5.0|Was a wonderful Christmas present. Arrived on time and in great condition. My daughter enjoyed the toy and all the others that I ordered.
1439152802|5.0|My first Kate Morton read and I was hooked from the start. Descriptively written mystery takes you from Queensland, Australia to England during the war years and well beyond.  I love a good mystery.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app is good because I can play offline when the internet is not available.  This app is also good because I am familiar with this game.  The last reason this game is good because I can win anytime I want to win.  On certain days.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game! I love it so much. SUPER ADDICTING!!! This is a great investment and will not waste your time.
B005C0DHEY|1.0|People should see the documentary \\"Fracknation\\" that exposes the lies and deceptions presented by Josh Fox in this documentary.  Fox presents so-called facts that are conveniently twisted or omitted and when challenged will not answer questions or supply the truth.  He has completely demonized an industry he knows little about and persuaded Hollywood types and liberal loonies it will destroy the planet.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Had a blast watching this one.  Will be a good one for when we have grandkids running around to watch with them.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|This is a must play game. Only the best gamers can win. This game requires strategy and lots of it. I was extremely impressed with the game play and graphics. Although sometimes it meses up only when your internet connection is not so good or when it does updates. Other than that everything else is awesome
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Really good movie.  This movie is not typical, the acting is great, as is the unusual story.  This is a good family movie.  I highly recommend this movie.
B00AE2IJIE|3.0|I did laugh out loud a few times, but over all, I was waiting for something to happen.  Not like some where you do not have time before something else goes on.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|In this game i have become a master. This is a must play game if you dont have it get it so far i have had no problems on my kindle fire other than that this game requires alot of space
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|i use it for work and as personal journal. replaced colornote, delicious, and google drive. it gets better everyday ...
B003O86FMW|5.0|I work construction and I finished the book in about with reading between job passes and while at the gym. Cash intriguingand I can't wait to get the third book!!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|So far it is really easy but i just started but i tbink this game is fun so far<br />I hope you guys like it to
030758836X|5.0|I was bored to death at first and could not figure out why my daughter insisted I read it but the more I read the harder i was to put down.
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|Excellent DVD, got for my granddaughter and she loves it. Would recommend for kids. She loves monster high sruff. Thanks
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|I can't play this game because I can't get pasted the swing part of the game but my friends and family love this game.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|This is not one of SK's most thought provoking books but I like the way he writes and he has some amazing ideas.  Very creative
B004KSQN7C|5.0|This is such a great album!!!! It has fun and catchy songs, not to mention an awesome and sexy album booklet. My favorite songs: I Wanna Go, (Drop Dead) Beautiful, How I Roll,and Selfish.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Great saga and lovely story lines behind all the characters that live in each of the towns. Can't wait to watch Season 2.
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|I like mahjong and this is VERY EASY to complete. 4 levels. with the chance to get 3 stars.  most levels i could complete in under 4 minutes. No progression after the fourth level-it just ends and you start all over. no challenge after that. Thats why only 3 for me...and only then because I like mahjong.
0385504209|5.0|I liked it better than the movie.  Intriguing story and arrived in perfect condition!  I would recommend to anyone looking for a little intrigue in their life.  Sheryl
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I'm obsessed with Les Miserables the musical.. so it's time I read the book.  such a fantastic read.  True Class!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My family and I love this game. Great graphics, fun activities in the game, and enough responsibility with the chores to make any parent happy.
B000SUKPKM|5.0|I think Johnny Rzeznik is a great performer and his band represents a fun and energetic band that will hopefully grow.  I thoroughly enjoy this album.  Thanks for the great packaging.  Sheryl
B009FZHYKU|3.0|love the show! this season is off to a slow start but I'm sure it will pick up soon. the governor is a real snake. A must love to hate kind of guyx-(
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Unbelievably good!!!!  Going to see her speak next Friday,  and can't wait!<br />The book was very moving,  everybody should read it.
B000001AKM|5.0|I absolutely love Lionel Richie's music, so I would recommend this album to anyone!  Arrived in great condition.  Thanks.  Marsha
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game is very fun and worth getting. I need 12 more words so I'm just gonna write random things.
B000H4QD1O|5.0|I have watched this many times and it never gets old, that for me is the mark of great TV.  So sorry it was cancelled!

B0063IH60K|4.0|I like this game to pass the time when I gust have a little time nd not enough time to start a book.
B009HV2JT8|1.0|This movie was terrible.  Absolutely terrible.  I read the book, which was quite good, and had high hopes for this movie.  Not so much -- I couldn't even finish it.  Not true to the book at all and all of the changes are for the worse.  Don't waste your time!
1616550414|5.0|All was in detail... the pics... the info... That includes a short manga! You name it! It's all inside the &#34;Hyrule Historia!&#34;
B009IEXKXI|5.0|If it didn't already have such good reviews this book would have been the sleeper of the year. I very much enjoyed every word.
B000001GBJ|5.0|Wonderful, soothing music. I play this CD throughout the day and never tire of it. It is one of the best collection of music I have ever purchased......wish I could find more like it.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I have tried other white noise generators but after trying the free version of this app I fell in love with it. I bought the premium version and have used it every night since I got it. it is truly worth every penny.
B000BO0LKY|5.0|This album was incredible, the deluxe platinum edition was a welcome addition to this collection. I especially like the song \\"Makin' It Last All Night\\" where she samples Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam's \\"I Wonder If I Take You Home\\".. this has been Mariah's best album to date.
B00006JSS8|5.0|I love Stevie. With that being said, the collective song choices are wonderful. The best gift I've given so far.
B003TQKVGU|5.0|A good read.  Helps a person understand their mind and how careful thought works in their life to bring about good things
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|Tom Cruise is a big star, but there are also tons of people who hate him and will not review his movie fairly because they do not like him as a person, they do not seperate him from the character he plays. Both my husband and I have read on the Lee Childs books and are huge fans and were so excited when this movie came out. It had a great twist and the fact that it did not have the traditional sex scene was a bonus. It was all action all the time. As far as the character, no Tom may have not been the perfect choice, as he is on the smaller less intimidating side, but he did a good job. I do hope that they make another one, because there is so much action in Child's books! I saw it twice in the theater and preordered the bonus edition for the behind the scenes
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really enjoy this game! it's truly much better than the first temple run.<br />Ps. in case you didn't know Jesus loves you :)
B004CEUEWE|5.0|Very well written, didn't find any thing they could have done different or better. Well worth renting, wish I had seen it on the big screen.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Has beautiful graphics, nice music, it's easy to pick up and fun to play. Just played for a couple of days but know this is a keeper.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It works, and it's free!  What more can you say?<br />It's simple to use, and the DISPLAY IS HUGE! (Good for my aging eyes.)
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is everything you want from Minecraft.  It is easy to use.  I love that I can play it anywhere I am.
B009EANE3M|5.0|The AMZN's samples are sometimes misleading because they are so short. However, I am so glad I took the chance on this new group's album when AMZN ran an insanely cheap one day sale.  All the songs are so good!  Good lyrics, great beats and easy to sing along to. I will be checking out their other works. And I will definitely would love to attend their show should they ever come to my town again.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|This was a great buy! It was brand new in the package and arrived within a few days!!! I would definitely purchase from this company again.
B00BBW15R8|5.0|This movie was unbelievably heartwarming and touching.  It proves that those of us who need the most also have the most to give.  Such a wonderful relationship.  Please make an American Version of this film.
0802473156|5.0|Someone I respect recommended this book and I am glad I read it.  Since then I have recommended it to 3 other people.<br /><br />I like the fact that Gary Chapman has so much experience, and that the information is put into to an easy to understand and use formula.  I think it can help any relationship.  I wish I had the knowledge when I raised my kids.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Passes the time and I love it. I am retired and this makes my day--especially if I win. I also bought another solitaire game and I like it also.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|It was aweful. gave my kindle a virus and wouldn't work. and after going through the trouble of fixing the virus the game was so bad. it may would have been a great game for a two year old. so listen to me DO NOT GET IT
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I enjoyed it , very exciting. Pleased with it as I was with the first book, hopefully the last one will be good too.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I enjoyed this book.  It's an easy read and hard to put down.  I can't wait to read book three.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|ITS REALLY GOOD but it's exactly like temple run.. but I still like it because it has a different theme.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|I great book. It captured my interest immediately. I couldn't put it down as it got close to the end.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is so fun  it is the best game ever! I just have 2 suggestions. 1 it needs herobrion (hope I spelled that right) 2 it needs mine Carts. Other than that it Is awesome
B00A8ECU24|4.0|A very cute and simple game. It stays true to the nature of the show. There are a couple of spots that I noticed that it gets a little buggy, but it tends to fix itself quickly enough.
1451629184|5.0|I like a book that can grab my attention from the get go and then hold it all the way to the end. I finished this book in just a few days, reading every chance I got. So hard to believe it's a true story! :(
B000H5TVKI|5.0|This movie should get six stars but you can only go as high as five.  I love this movie due to its action style with a decent story.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is by far the most interesting show. I am not a tv junkie but this show had me hooked from the beginning. The writers have got to be genius'. I will continue being a fan.
B008I3RARW|1.0|There are better racing games that have superior performance. Only one car and one track. The game play is mediocre at best.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|I miss having the chance to earn 'powerups' for the slingshot, bombs, earthquakes, etc. like I do on my Facebook account.
B000001ABD|2.0|The low rating here is certainly not based on the artist or songs, button the overwhelming amount of digital compression on many of the cuts on here. They sound thin and tinny, not the was I am sure Stevie designed them to be heard or felt. The sound issue is a disappointment.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think that it needs all of the items from the pc version like the nether the end and etc. It would make  it way more fun
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Loved this movie, everything about it. The way the story was told, the cinematography, the emotion, action and heartbreak are brilliantly done. It's one to own, not rent.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|I would be upset if I had to wait any length of time to read the next book in this series. But as it stands, I am going to buy book 2 immediately. If you have a love for dystopian fiction, ranks up there with Divergent and The Hunger Games. Fast paced, and characters you care for, but don't exactly sure know why, will keep you turning the page for more.
0670024813|5.0|This book is like a like a hot fudge sundae topped with whipped cream, nuts and a cherry. It's to be devoured in small bites and savored. The World Until Yesterday offers a trip back in time, a window looking into where we came from.<br />It's an exciting adventure to  unspoiled and primitive places where we meet the locals and learn their way of life. Wars and civil justice, trade and language, religion and constructive paranoia.  I found the chapters about marriage, childrearing,birth control, breast feeding, health and fitness and the treatment of elderly especially interesting and informative.<br />Throughout the author  provides comparisons between  our modern civilization and that of traditional societies. We have much to learn from the old ways, the traditional societies.
B007IK44CK|5.0|Love it! Best of all the Mission Impossible movies. The action, adventure, intrigue, etc. is amazing. Recommend to all &#34;action, adventure&#34; movie goers.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Really fun! Just like a real horse&middot; The game is relaxing after a stressful day. I like the fact I can create my own stables.
B00992CF6W|5.0|if you get pocket invediter Ps. pocket invediter only will work on. tablet/Kendal.  minecraft is. awesome. there's mobs at night. so get armor and sores too fight of the night
B007BVT5N4|5.0|This book was touching. It made me  smile laugh cry tears of joy. I love justin so much this book that he wrote gives you so much information about his life, Carreer, him, and what he goes through.(daily basis) I am proud to be a BELIEBER. :) and I I really enjoyed this book.
B00846WWVM|3.0|As so many other reviewers have noted,  the controls really need some refinement.  It also does get rather difficult pretty quickly.  It would be nice if the devs would allow a bit more time on the clock for the quick ratcheting up in the level of difficulty.<br /><br />The graphics are lovely on the Fire,  and the sounds are appropriate - not annoying,  which is nice.  (As well as the option to mute.)<br /><br />ll I would love to give this nice little game a 4 or 5, and if the developers at least fix the fine control issue,  I will happily do so.  Nice as a FAOTD,  but needs a bit of tweaking to justify full purchase price.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Bond got some serious emotion, finally. Anger one can believe. Doubt one can feel. And determination one can root for. Granted, it's still Bond, so the action strains the limits of acceptability, but at least the gadgets were truer to life.<br /><br />And a final thank you to Dame Judy Dench and her portrayal of the human side of M.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is an addcting game.  it is also the best game in the world.  keep it up. do more updates.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|In this clever take on basic Star Trek plots, Scalzi has created an interesting plot with just enough complexity to hold our interest. It's space opera from the perspective of the lower-level crew (think Rosencranz and Gildenstern Are Dead). I thought the pacing was a little slow in the last third of the book, but not so slow that I lost interest.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I honestly love temple run 2 much better than the first. the quality is better and its more fun and the course is more challenging
072325804X|5.0|Of all the collections we have, this single book does the best job of presenting all the Potter tales. This version is an improvement from the 1989, original, but I was disappointed to see that it was printed in China.  How about find an American printer; we are going  to have to pay American wages to American workers to keep our economy strong. We would have been willing to pay a higher price to keep the work in American. Think about it, dear friends.

B004J4WLB4|4.0|Though I often felt sorry for the girl, I also wanted to just shake her sometimes, and say &#34;you don't have to do it all alone.  You have caring people around you.<br />I was surprised to find how interested I became in learning the meaning of flowers.

B004WGIXX4|1.0|It feels like someone wrote this on a note pad while drinking in their basement overnight. Seriously the worst movie I have ever seen. Ashton Kutcher is by far the most talentless character in this film and brings  Natalie Portman down with him. Seriously the most cheap laughs I've ever heard. Someone must have pitched this and it got approved without ever being read and then they advertised the crap out of it to make it appear watchable.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Everything is so much easier and it flows so much better than the other keyboards. I would definitely recommend for everyone.

B00A6TYCNQ|1.0|Gameloft you have a problem with some apps the one I'm talking about is Order &amp; Chaos. You have to take off the subscription part because when the subscription membership is over your basically taking away Order &amp; Chaos from some users. They already payed. Another is the updates people should at least update from the appstore. There there is my message to you gameloft Amazon, do me a favor  tell this to Gameloft.

B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best app you could get on kindle fire...You need to get this app!!!  Thank you Mojang for making this app.!!  You can make anything in this game!!  I like this game better than survival craft.....I do not know why there are 326 one star reviews??!!  You can make a snowman and it is kinda hard.. One of my friends had MINECRAFT on his ipad. So I did not have to go to the reviews.  Get MINECRAFT!!
B0050PYNOY|5.0|Why is this rated as only three stars?<br />Because regardless of your age, background, IQ, race, sexual orientation, or any other number of factors I could list...<br /><br />You are apt to either love or hate this movie. Hence the plethora of 1 star reviews in a bloody and graphic deathmatch versus 5 star reviews.<br />You can read every review in the world and never experience 'Your Highness' in it's full glory. I laughed so loud I honked like a goose at parts of this movie- an untapped ability of which I was previously unaware. My husband laughed so hard he saw stars and made a strange out of air gasping/whistling sound as he tried desperately to breathe and laugh at the same time. Two friends we watched this movie with also found themselves capable of stunning new feats of laughter, while two others sat silent and grim as they died a little inside.<br /><br />Crude, vulgar, profane, explicit, illicit, genius, inane, uncouth, clumsy, inarticulate, horrid, hilarious, radical, stunning, brilliant, authentic, wtf, roflmfao... the graphic adjectives or internet acronyms you can spew about this film are as diametrically opposed as any that a talented wordsmith can illustrate. My friends and I are not unintelligent people and none of us are teenagers... in fact: the people laughing the hardest were actually the oldest of the group. With our collective ages spanning 25-42, more than half of us loved the movie, the other half were less... enthralled.<br />This is not your atypical satire as it boldly pushes boundaries that some individuals find extremely offensive.<br /><br />You've been fairly warned, but if you have the stomach to sit through what you may regard as the worst film ever, I would dare say that comparing it to 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' is unfair to say the least. You may laugh until you cry, or regard the movie as torture. If you like combining weed and AD&D in a comedy: Watch this film. If neither of those sound even remotely interesting to your tastes... don't waste your time unless you are looking for MST3K-like material.<br />In my humble opinion, this is one of those priceless artifacts in my Blu-Ray collection I can watch repeatedly and still laugh every time.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|this game is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo awesome!!!!! the story line is awesome too. its kind of creepy at times though. keep in mind though that this is just a trial, if you want to finish it it costs $1.99. when i got to that part i was highly disappointed with it.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Get to know not only Lincoln, but all those around Lincoln, as Doris Kearns Goodwin paints a vivid description of the men, the women, and the times in which they lived.  It's also a history lesson that reads as smoothly as the best fiction.  Great stuff.
086571701X|5.0|My husband and I are really enjoying this book. It gives you step by step instructions and explains the best ways to have success with this process. Very informative and easy to understand.
B008QLXSG8|5.0|This book must have slipped by me in High School - perhaps it wasn't required reading, but it should have been.  A gripping and easy read it pulls you in from the first sentence &#34;Mom died today - or was it yesterday?&#34; and doesn't let you go until the end.  A great comment on our own lives and sense of worth, in any generation.  Great stuff.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|The Secret Daughter was recommended to me by a friend. I read the book quickly since I wanted to see what would happen in the story. As a mother, I felt the pain, loss and aching heart that each mother felt for their daughter. The flip flop between India and California was interesting and allowed for the comparing of  the two cultures. I recommend this book because the writing flowed, the characters were deep and the bond between mother and child amazing.
