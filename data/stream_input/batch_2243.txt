B002LC8HF0|5.0|I assumed that Brandon Sanderson would be a boring writer, since he was the one finishing the Wheel of Time series, but Mistborn has more than proven me wrong. He blows your mind every dozen pages or so with things that you really should have seen coming, but didn't.<br /><br />It's the last in this trilogy, but I really hope he continues with other Mistborn books. I had way too much fun reading this.
B00B23O96A|4.0|Many of Eric Clapton's peers are constantly compared to their own past, and none more than Clapton himself. Whenever Clapton releases something like this, or his collaboration with Wynton Marsalis, even his most ardent fans become downright hateful because their idol is not tearing through yet another blues guitar solo. He even is being criticized in other reviews here for not writing any of the songs on this album, although he has done exactly the same in the past on From The Cradle and Me and Mr. Johnson, not to mention his biggest hits, I Shot The Sheriff and Cocaine were originally written and recorded by others.<br /><br />Artists of Clapton's stature learned long ago that \\"you can't please everyone so you got to please yourself.\\" And that is what Clapton has set out to do on Old Sock. The songs fit like a comfortable, warm old sock. Clapton even avoided a major label release and put this out on his own label. No one is worried about how much profit this labor of love will make. It's for Eric, and if his fans enjoy it, so much the better. It amazes me that fans think that they are somehow \\"owed\\" something from their idols.<br /><br />This fan enjoys it. I appreciate when one of my longtime favorites relaxes and does something that they love, something that comes from the heart. Clapton surrounds himself with excellent musicians, not the least of which Doyle Bramlett. There are no surprises or risky moves in any of the arrangements here. Just pleasant music that you can listen to on the beach (hence the photo on the cover). That Clapton can step outside of his blues guitar god persona and do something like this that is well-executed and enjoyable is a credit to his talent, not a detriment. He's obviously had a great time making this album and it shows. I have fun listening to it. Thanks for this nice little gift, Eric.
030746363X|5.0|After reading the book it becomes a excellent resource for researching in regards to the body and training.<br />Would recommend following this guy's recommended readings, websites, etc...
B000FC1HBY|5.0|My cuz got me to read the first book and I was hooked. I can hardly stop reading them because I just HAVE to know what happens next.
B001KEHAI0|5.0|Hey, It's Groundhog Day in Blu-Ray. What more can I say. Liked the extras. 15th Anniversary Special Edition too. Good One !
B005XQ973M|5.0|I read a similar book which described the atrocities committed by the Japanese during WW2 named &#34;Flyboys&#34;. It is definitely worth reading as well.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|A lot of surprises in this book. Was definitely worth the purchase. The beginning, middle, and end was perfect .
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it's a brilliant game that's fun to play. it's challenging but doesn't take a genius to enjoy it. the graphics are beautiful and if you love horses you'd love this game.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I do nit like reading at all, haven't touched a book since high school and when I saw this I thought I'd give it a try.  After just the first few pages I was hooked! I couldn't put it down. I have read it none stop for the past week and just finished  the 3rd book.  And excited for the 4th tomorrow!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I wanted to be review 8000. good app. very addicting. but it lost all my data. very fun app still.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|If you enjoy combat narrative and aren't offended by raw language this is a well written book.<br /><br />Chris Kyle was a true American war hero..It's a shame he died so tragically after surviving the terrors of war.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I checked this show out on reruns while I was off for surgery. I am now hooked, I am now trying to catch up so I can watch when new episodes come on. Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic have some of the best chemistry in any show I have seen!
B008HFWF3U|5.0|Great job Pat! This project shows that you are truly a well rounded muscian and composer. The CD's are awesome!!!
B0086213XW|5.0|It was an interesting look at relationships.  I watch it quite a few times meaning I must have really enjoyed it, but at this point don't think I could watch it again.  It's depressing to watch relationships end, but this was a well constructed story.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is so Asimov I wot to diy to git jack pot or make more eggs to fir Cu's it making me delly made
B00493AD74|4.0|Not a movie I would like to admit that I liked, but I did.  Gets a little eye rolling at the end.  Actually the main character is kind of annoyingly self-centered, but we can all be that way sometimes.  And who doesn't want to travel.  It was fun to just vicariously live through her.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|For me, this was the best book in the trilogy.  I would totally recommend all three books in this series to anyone.  Absolutely loved it!
B004Q3SGWG|4.0|It was an interesting movie idea.  My dad who sees pretty much every single movie the comes out in theaters refused to see it with me because he thinks it's glamorizing someone's stupid decisions.  And it is to a point.  Just like Into the Wild.  These men somehow became heroes for putting themselves into horrible, unnecessary positions.  Looking beyond that, watching the mind of a person in this sort of situation makes for a good story.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! I can't wait to see the movie.  I was skeptical at first and didn't buy it the first time I saw it because the movie trailer on TV didn't shed an interesting light on the movie.  Then I saw the full Life of Pi movie trailer at the theater and went straight home and bought the book on Kindle.  I am so glad I did.  That was a great story I'm happy I didn't miss.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|The last full season of the Tenth Doctor!<br /><br />Good episodes and character arcs. Watch it if you are a fan of the Doctor.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Everyone should read all three books in this series.  They were a great read.  The descriptions used in the intimate scenes made you feel as if it was you in the story as it was happening.  Phenomenal sensuality.
B008M7JODC|5.0|This is one of those tv series that makes you want to watch every episode in one night.  Like, lost , supernatural, SGU
B0042XA2U4|4.0|This was a good book. Not as good as the movie, but it was still a good story. I'm glad I bought it.
B001XUJMZK|4.0|Always is good to see again a great production like this movie. I will recommend this movie 100%, It met my expectations.
0679746048|3.0|It's always been hard for me to judge nonfiction books such as this one. They're not my typical type of story, but one here and there keeps things from getting especially boring. They're just hard for me to get into. I really liked the style this was written in-free, go with the flow. No pressures. Just looking to see what happens on the ride. But it wasn't specially intriguing, or gripping, edge-of-your-seat material. It was just . . . okay. One of those books you read and maybe re-read, maybe forget about.<br /><br />Susanna searches to find her place in society as well as in her new home, a psychiatric hospital. As she tries to find out what led her to this and what could have changed in her life, the reader is shown a glimpse of life as a patient through her eyes.<br /><br />Girl, Interrupted is a quick, enjoyable read, good for those who have a fondness for memoirs, biographies, or are interesting in learning about life at a psychiatric hospital. I give it 3/5 stars.
B00364K6YW|5.0|Pride and Prejudice the book by Jane Austen is amazing, and this Dvd version is superb. The casting is spot on. Colin Firth IS exactly how I pictured Mr.Darcy ,right down to the arrogant, smug look on his face, a face I wanted to slap several times while watching, which of course is a shame because ...well Colin Firth is easy on the eyes. The casting of Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth was a good choice, you could just feel the chemistry between the two, as it practically leapt off the screen. Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth's mother.. well oh my goodness she was just so annoying, and the actress who portrayed her was amazing.  I liked the fact that this was a 2 disc set, and I liked that it was in an Episode format. Sometimes I just don't feel like sitting down for a whole movie, and being that this version is 5hrs and 23 minutes. I could watch an episode and then watch another episode later.<br /><br />I haven't seen another version of this, so I can't compare it to another, however I can say that after reading the book The characters of Mr Darcy,Elizabeth, and Elizabeth's mother portrayed in this version are EXACTLY how I  pictured them. The only thing is the actress who portrayed Jane, ELizabeth's older, beautiful sister is not how I pictured her, but she was still good. The price on this was great, and don't we all want a Mr.Darcy?
B0018CWEYY|5.0|Season 4 is amazing!! Charlotte, Daniel, Frank, and Miles are great new characters! Each episode is better than the last. Watching it from the first to last season is awesome!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|This series is very engaging for my whole family. It is rare to have a show that we all look forward to!
B006IYG5HE|5.0|WAY above average writer.  somewhat too complicated. I am a speed reader and had to slow down and pay attention
B0087YYHZU|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies and I am not really one who likes musicals. However the talents of Gene Kelly, Donald O'Conner and Debbie Reynolds are simply wonderful. This purchase was an upgrade. We already had a regular DVD and the modest price for blu Ray moved me to buy it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Our 10 year old loves this game. Our only complaint is sometimes the ads pop up at weird times. This teaches a few of the things that go in to taking care of a horse, an d it's great for kids who will never actually have a horse.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|This is hands down one of my all time favorite movies. Quentin Tarantino is very dependable when it comes to making amazing movies. He never disappoints. Believe me, it doesn't feel like three hours when you watch it. Another instant classic by Tarantino.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and buy this film. It is money well spent!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I enjoyed this show. I found myself drawn into the sense of adventure that they portray.  It is an entertaining show.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This show is amazing, one of the best in a long time.  I am really sad to see it go off of the air :(  Irregardless, I watch this on my kindle at the gym and needless to say it makes the 50 min go by so fast, so fast, that I end up working out for another 50 min so I can watch another episode!  Truely a great show for anyone who has a wondering mind.  Everyone will enjoy Dr. Bishop!  He literally makes me laugh out loud with his wits, enthusiam for answers, and love of food!  He also is incredibly endearing for the fine line he walks between brilliance and insanity.  John Noble does an amazing job of making that character a one of a kind unique wonderful believable person!  And he was in Lord of the Rings, so I'll always be a fan :)
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Remember having played it elsewhere and loving it. Excited i can have it on my kindle. very fun and most importantly a fantastic soundtrack
0307888908|5.0|If you wanna learn about:<br />-The fertile culture of Silicon Valley (Practical and tangible examples)<br />-How to pursue the breakout opportunities and increase the chance of recognizing them (the whole chapter five)<br />-How to plan for your career life and move toward your goals without uncertainty (ABZ planning)<br />-How to build genius relationships and empower yourself and your network and learn about the hidden treasure right now in your networks (the whole chapter 4)<br />Then, this is the right book for you.<br />I read it three times and still want to read it again.
B0027MJU00|5.0|honestly, i initially had a hard time getting into this one. the lead character, libby, is not someone i would usually cheer for. she has so completely given up... and, although you can understand why, she is just unlikable. BUT then she begins to fight... from that point on you just cant give up on her. loved it
1451695195|5.0|This was a book that was recommended by a friend. I have not been able to put it down once I started to read it
B000JMKTLO|5.0|love this book! author delivers an unexpected twist. have also read dark places & now starting gone girl. wish she had more books...
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was funny and had a good story line. There are a few typos, but well worth the read.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|I liked that it was 4 season in total. The acting and story were on point. I will recommend a must watch for everyone.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It was outstanding in cast, plot, beauty of the set and the area outside.  I became personally involved in the lives of each character.
B0024CEY36|4.0|Perhaps not among his masterpieces:  the plot is quite hard to believe, but all secret weapons of mr. follett's arsenal are there:  great characters, historical fresco, neverending thrill,
B009MCRHH6|1.0|I disliked this game very much, it was pointless and boring. It did not hold my interest or a spot to remain. On my phone.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|These are wonderful productions! On par with Foyle's War but very different (a bit more &#34;soap opera-ish&#34;). All the Downton Abby shows and series are SUPERB, and have to be considered the &#34;Gold Standard&#34;.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really appreciate good quality writing since there is horrible work out there like Twilight. Katniss is so easy to relate to and the situation she and everyone else is in can be applied to any wartime this world has experienced. Thank you Suzanne Collins for writing such good literature.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Interesting game love the storyline. This game so far is one of my favorite games and I recommend it to any one who likes a good mystery.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is good and at the end Rowley has a girlfriend just thought you should know  but the book is long
B006LSZECO|1.0|My sister loved it, my niece, my best friend but I find it just dragging.  My friend gave me the ending thinking that I would want to finish it but if I hadn't had to pay for it I would never read another chapter.
0345803485|1.0|Really?  This is a sensational book?  Waste of time and not even a LITTLE sexy.  Boring.<br />Sorry, but probably the worst book I ever read.  Could not bring myself to finish it.  UGH!!
B003DZX3SA|5.0|This is was still in the sealed package when i got it. Great quality. perfect for little growing girls.I loved it.
0062011847|5.0|Yet another fabulous adventure with Sam Vimes. I adore Vimes, and Pratchett is as witty and clever and hilarious as ever. 10 stars!!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We enjoyed watching this season . Only problem is it took too much time. Still, will be waiting for season 4,
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. I beat it in only a few days, but the puzzles were satisfying. It was simple enough that my baby sister stayed interested, but complicated enough that I found  myself redoing levels time after time.
B003VXMMTK|4.0|The whole story was great - up until the end. It followed a pretty good pace and kept me engaged until the last bit where it all was just thrown in and hurried a bit much.
B000HSKUBE|4.0|Well done black comedy. I recommend it wholeheartedly. Give it a chance. The writing is witty and the acting superb.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Great book for the 20 something females making decisions about their future. You only have one life and more than likely it will include difficult decisions to make.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|It's a classic, what else can I say? Everyone should read this book at least once in their lives. Beautiful.
B00B0U2SFE|5.0|After the great success of the Lincoln film, the 20th Anniversary Limited Edition of Schindler's List was released. Since I was in the presence of film masters, I thought, maybe I can watch and learn a few things about when and how to narrate in video and in words. I was doing fine until I was completely absorbed by the story and overwhelmed by the tragedy. I think I will be watching it again.
B004QX07G4|5.0|I love Ellen. She's hilarious. This book was hilarious. She definitely is a great read when you need a laugh.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I always enjoy reading Nicholas Sparks, his stories are always keep you wanting to read on.<br />No bad language in his books
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|A fun way to waste a little time, good for amusement and challenges the brain.  Has multiple levels so you don't get bored.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Funny and interesting, ending up being a good book.<br />It was my first book for my Kindle, it did keep my interest
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great little time filler...for when you're standing in line or waiting at the Doctor/Dentist... It's quick and you can start and stop in seconds...
B004GHNIRK|1.0|This book is very hard readingif you are not up on your history. I suggest you see the movie then read the book.
B004ZJZQH4|3.0|Let me start with saying the movie quality on the blu-ray was outstanding.  The only reason I gave 3 stars is due to the digital copy. The two main reasons I ordered this was for the blu-ray and the digital copy.  When I received my first copy, the disc was perfect, but the digital copy code was out of date which did not allow me to get everything I had paid for.  I contacted customer service and they were surprised the code was out of date and did not work.  They did send me a new copy of the blu-ray with a different code and I had to send the original order back to Amazon.  Once again the new disc was great, but the digital copy code was out of date and would not work.  At that point, I just decided to let it go and realize that although it would be nice to get everything you paid for, sometimes that just does not happen.  Awesome movie, wish I could have the digital copy.
B0026KX6TY|5.0|The cast, the subject, the dynamics of living with a gifted child. So who's Dad are you. The quality of the streaming was excellent.
B001HQZJPM|5.0|I owned one of the three movies, but this set was way to good of a deal to pass up. Love these! If you haven't seen them, just buy them all.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My wife and daughter watch this together and while it is on I am free to do as I wish without supervision from an assumed Higher power.
0930289234|5.0|My largest sized novel. Colors are awesome!<br /><br />If you've already read Watchmen, you will enjoy this book and the story once again.<br /><br />If you have not read the Watchmen, buy this, right now. This is one of the best graphic novels. When your done reading this and your hungry for more graphic novels, I suggest reading The Dark Knight Returns.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It's addictive! I strongly recommend that you download this game. I play this game so much times, it's uncountable.
B007PVHANM|5.0|I haven't received both items for Marley & Chasing Mavericks. I honestly can say, that I LOVE the DVD's! But, shipping/delivery is not one time. I've purchased and ordered these items on March 5th and is surprise at how long it takes to get. If I knew that it was traveling through, fedex smart post - I would've used another shipping option. When I first ordered it, I read that the estimated delivery would be March 13th. It was suppose to be a birthday gift, now its a late bday gift (but that's ok). Now that this has happen, it's probably best that I call it in and ask my items to be shipped USPS.<br />Other than that, I can't wait for this person to receive it when it arrives.
B003TTKB5I|4.0|I truly enjoy tv programs with out commericals and I have always liked drama. this program is filled with drama in the ER it makes you laugh and cry feel good and sad very enjoyable to watch I am currently up to season 3 and will do all that I can.

0470474874|5.0|I needed something to help me run my business without spending a lot of money there are lots of tricks and ways to make excel work that I had no clue about and still dont but I will.
B005VOXPUC|5.0|This elephant series of Schleich animals was a big hit with my 3 year old nieces for Christmas gifts.  They were a big hit!
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This game is mesmerizing to me, in a good way!  Very relaxing and stress relieving.  So simple yet challenging enough to keep my attention.
B001URVSPS|5.0|John Legend has a smooth voice with great lyrics and some of my favorite collaborations. Lauryn Hill, Snoop Dogg and Kenye West! Classic and always in heavy rotation.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Fun game to pass the time with. Nice graphics and challenging enough to keep me interested and playing on a regular basis.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I used to like Bruno Mars...but after this album I LOVE HIM! My fav. song is Money Make Her Smile! Great beat and fun lyrics.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|This book is different from the movie which I saw first. Even though the book was first it was weird to me. But then I realized this was one of the best books I've ever read.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|I would highly recommend this usb cord. My sister and I both have kindles mine an older version and hers the newer cheaper one with the touch screen. The usb worked well for both are kindles and as an added bonus it was also compatible with my android phone. If i ever need another one, I'll be buying this one again.
B008M721MS|5.0|I love Kindle Skype because I can connect with my family, especially my grandchildren, where ever we are! It is so nice<br />to be able to see them and talk to them!  Even when we are not together we can get together!  I Love it!!
B007R108WA|2.0|This movie, with some notably serious stars, fails to engage, fails to elicit any sympathy for the lead, and so too rapidly falls into confusing segues with plot points abandoned.  Couldn't watch it to the end.
B006LSZECO|2.0|The book draws you in quickly, but soon leaves you wanting to read the ending and be done with it. The incongruity of the lead characters was disappointing.<br />For example, Amy, the wife, was supposed to be brilliant, devious, clever etc. but was stupid enough to show her money and her face to other occupants of the low life motel where she was staying and consequently gets robbed. Then Amy has to murder another character to cover her moves.<br />The idiotic husband character, Nick,  takes her back as his wife, after she frames him and trys to kill him. The plot was thin. The ending was also disappointing.<br />I think the author was looking to sell this story to Hollywood for a movie. An easy read and not worth the money I spent on it.
B0044WSF5M|1.0|I love American Graffiti--everybody loves American Graffiti. But the sound on this was way too low most of the time. I was disappointed. (And it's not the movie's age, I don't think. I've had better experiences with much older films.)
B00BHMETKC|3.0|This film was really overhyped. Why did this win Best Picture instead of Life of Pi? It's a moderately interesting action flic, laced with inside-baseball joking references to the Hollywood scene - presumably the members of the academy found those to be immensely amusing, though I just found them to be tiresome distractions in the dialog. The hostages come across as complete twits not deserving of being saved - why the hell did they let the intruders enter without a fight? They then proceed to whine and quake in their boots when a way out is offered - one that might actually have an element of risk to their worthless persons. Aside from the protagonists being totally unsympathetic, the action was slow and unengaging. The makers of this films should have studied the Bourne movies to see how to do an action scene.<br /><br />I also found the political spin irritating. At the end the message scrolls that the hostages were released on Jan 20, 1981 as if Carter finally achieved success. It was not mentioned that that date was the inauguration day of Reagan as the new US president and the Iranians were afraid to antagonize the new man who might actually have cajones, unlike the sniveling Carter.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Just that, simple, good, technical for the dork in us all and just great.  The end was a bit rushed but otherwise phenominal.
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|This is a program that is a good basic dictionary program.  And, given that it is free, how can you go wrong?  I use it everyday.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|So happy to have this on Blu-Ray in my DVD library!  Really looking forward to sharing this movie with my daughters!
B00992CF6W|4.0|it is great but when it comes to creative all you can do is place blocks and destroy them but survival man that's awesome
B008MPQ0R2|5.0|Movies, after watching hundreds of them, I hardly got excited when I saw the next one. But this movie has completely turned me around. I should not rate this movie, because everything is well over the rating. Comparison? And there is none out there can be used for that reason. Many reviewers praised this film, and they were not lying. In my opinion, the director Wong Kar-wai was so far ahead of their peers, the techniques, the music, the cast and the styles he used in this film was unbelievable successful. Also the cameraman has done an excellent job to capture the \\"mood\\" between actors Maggie Cheung Man-yuk and Tony Leung Chiu-wai. Warning: you might not find another movie like this, and might end up depress again.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book keeps me wanting to read it nonstop but alas I can not :( I can't wait to get the others
B00795P4EG|5.0|Looks seamless on those small &#34;camera&#34; pictures.  You can take out unwanted people - even if you know them (grin).  Love it!
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I pulled the trigger on this watch because it was on sale and I had a giftcard.  Figured I would add it to my small, but growing, watch collection.  I am truly surprised at how much I like this watch.  I won't call it small, but it is normal-sized, and much smaller than my almost obnoxious Nixon Chronicle.  It took me a day or two to get used to the size, but it has become my go-to watch, and I wear it daily now.  The pictures do not do it justice at all.  The face really pops, and I've received many compliments on it.  Also, I haven't had one issue with time differentiation at all.  I set it about a week ago and it has kept with my work time clock all the way.  I did change the band to the NATO band linked below, and it really makes it look sharp.  I am really happy with it, and glad I stumbled across it.<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009CYJ82Q/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|This episode had some fun plot twists, plus the question of will Holmes be tempted by drugs from his old dealer.  Can he figure out where the kidnapped daughter is kept before she is killed?  You'll have to watch to see how he solves this case.  I love the partnership of Holmes and Watson, hope they always keep it a friendship and nothing more, just like the originals.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I am fairly new to PC gaming, so this is my first real gaming mouse. Although I am used to only three buttons, (right, left, and scroll click) I easily picked up the other buttons, although they are far more sensitive than I had anticipated (but that's definitely not a bad thing!). Although there is nothing super fancy about this mouse, it feels like it is built incredibly solid, and the &#34;breathing&#34; anchor is a nice touch, with supposedly 16 MILLION different colors! It is super precise in my gaming and has already had an impact on my gaming performance! It's a steal at $40 (or $50 or $60, whatever I paid for it!).
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I really loved this book.  I am a big Stephen King fan & I think he did a fantastic job with this book.  He did a fantastic job of bringing the late 50s & early 60s to the reader and I really empathized with the main character and the task he was there to do.  I haven't read any other reviews of this book, but I have a feeling some might be disappointed with the outcome.  I think it was the only way to end the book.  I highly recommend to anyone, Stephen King fan or not.
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|This movie is by far the worst script and most boring James Bond movie!<br /><br />There is not more to say!!
B008G12EUY|5.0|I love this album so much.  Definitely one of my top Muse albums, probably right after Black Holes & Revelations.  If you like Muse this is a must buy.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best app EVER!!! I'm addicted, can't put it down. Get it! You may not want to buy a seven dollar app but its worth it! It will keep you busy for a LONG time! I will play this for a long time!!
B000SGRONM|3.0|This is a nice collection of short stories, but I wasn't blown away by any of them.  I did have a good chuckle a few times.
B004J4WLB4|1.0|The positive is the setting in San Francisco.  Really enjoyed reading about her life in the city.  However, the main character is awful - there is no redeeming quality about her.  Writing is a bit light - would say good for a light read, except light reads should be enjoyable characters and there are none here.
0060245867|5.0|I absolutely loved this book as a kid & now I am buying it for friends for their baby showers.  Kids will love it!!!
B004XGN8W4|5.0|Pretty awesome idea. Works great and not as heavy as I thought it would be. The sound quality could be better but you can't expect much out of a carrying case.
030758836X|4.0|This book is an exciting read. The characters are intriguing and wickedly charming. Loved all the plots and turns and<br />wishful thinking that comes from both of them. I also liked that every other chapter  was written in their voice. However, the ending is so awfully frustrating and irritating' I swore I would never read another word by this author! Seriously! It's as if one day she said, &#34;Ahh, I'm bored with this and I want to go shopping-so next page-the end!&#34; The story literally just stops. So if you want a good read, and can tolerate a book that appears to have lost its last few pages-then enjoy!!!
B002L3ARRU|5.0|I never get enough of watching this movie, Ive watched like 3 times since January, its always fun to watch this movie. Its a good comedy, they dont make much like this anymore.
B004CFBMRY|4.0|the book covers a lot of peripheral material related to running- anatomy, physiology, useful stuff on the whole.  I felt the carrier story was a bit melodramatic at times, but maybe some like it that way.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|It was interesting to go behind the scenes of an important event I had mostly forgotten and probably knew little about at the time.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Excellent in all ways.  The story, characters, and acting are superb.  I rarely find a television show that is as good as a book.  This one is better.
B003FL6SRA|3.0|I rented this to watch with my children as I thought this looked like a movie they would really enjoy. I assumed with a PG rating that it would be fairly safe for a family movie. However, there is extensive use of profanity, torture, sensual images and other things I really wasn't expecting to see in a movie with this rating. Overall, I thought it was a decent movie; it just may not be appropriate for younger children.
B007SGM084|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read. Could not put it down at times. Definately a must read book.
B0053TMP24|4.0|This book was great. I totally love the Percy Jackson and the Heros of Olympus books. I can't wait for the fourth Heros book to come out. I need to know what happens!
B0044C6V0S|5.0|Love this show and all characters are super! I am a late joiner of the Bones fan club, but better late than never. So glad I finally started watching. I especially enjoy the technicality and complexity of the situations...very interesting.

B0014JKJJI|3.0|for some reason those fid to small so I had to return the item and get them in one size bigger, very comfortable.
B005DF2QMC|1.0|Very difficult to use. Do not buy unless you have an advance degree in technology. I have wasted my money!
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I really enjoyed this show. The character development is good and it really draws you in. Anyone who likes historical dramas should watch this show

B00992CF6W|5.0|Version 0.6.1 alpha is the best version to play. You still have all the same things on the kindle fire edition that u do on the iPod iPhone or iPad versions. The only thing I have a problem with is the chest capacity which is less than the iPad version
B009LH1Y1W|4.0|Love this show but don't know how much longer they can keep it going.  They have got to wrap this up sometime.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Love the game and love the fact that there are no ads popping up when I am near a wi-fi site. My great nephew got me hooked and I have no problem zapping those pigs!
B007REV4YI|5.0|I have seen most of the Bond movies, and this one is the best of em'. Bardem did an outstanding job as the first (openly) gay Bond villain. There are a couple of major surprises towards the end, to boot!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I love Once upon a time. It has some great action, and there is always something about that little town in Maine.
1451696191|5.0|This is absolutely great book with a fantastic story. The only issue whatsoever is the cover. I'd prefer the original book's cover, but I don't mind all that much about the movie cover, not enough to impact the rating at least.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in reading about the antics of high-schoolers. It's for just about any age above the middle-school level and I found myself not wanting to put this book down for anything.
0802473156|5.0|I love this book I recommend this to couples that are having trouble expressing their intimate feelings. It has helped my husband express his feeling for the first time in our 18 year marriage.
B009O2XY12|5.0|Only deal with this is after so many games they want you to buy it and  if you don't then you can't play it any more
B009HUB40Y|5.0|It a lot of fun. I think its a real heart game.I got one of my friends to get it
B008383GE8|4.0|My high-school level physics was at times stretched, but the ideas presented here were just so astonishing it really didn't matter.<br />From an early age we are told, taught, and we learn that something can't come from nothing. One of the startling observations in this book is that our common sense simply does not apply to the early stages of the universes existence. The conditions at that time were so unlike everything we know and understand that common-sense fails.<br />The only reason I didn't give this a 5-star rating is that Krauss very occasionally labours a point - spending too much time in what appeared to me as an obscure detail, and I lost track of the point he was trying to make.
B000W15AQ6|5.0|I had to rebuy this album because my hard copy from years ago was lost.  I just bought it digitally this time.  Its worth it just for \\"when I'm gone\\"!
B007A4SDCG|5.0|I seek exemplary manuscripts. Those that don't just tell us things we know, but shift the paradigm. This book falls in that category I think. While I'm not sure I agree with all he says, Pressfield gave me fresh vision, and that is rare.
0810993139|5.0|Me gusto el libro porque estaba completamente nuevo y llego en el momento exacto en que nos dijeron, gracias. .
B00B23O96A|2.0|What happened?  Certainly is an appropriate album title...maybe it should be referred to as \\"Old Stinky Sock.\\" As other reviewers have said, Clapton just seems to be going through the motions on this one.  It doesn't appear that much thought was put into the performance of these songs...certainly doesn't have the excitement that Clapton fans had become accustomed to.  Really disappointing.  Save your money on this one and go back and purchase some of his older works from the great years!
1932907009|1.0|Blake Snyder treats screenwriting like a science, perhaps this is the reason why his screenplays stink. While he's great at breaking things down into forumlas and categories, he doesn't understand the intricacies of good writing. I dont think he truly understands originality, intrigue, tension, character or atmosphere (all though I'm sure he could pull apart each one, group them into subcategories and tell us exactly how they MUST be implemented)
B006RJTIF6|5.0|Very spooky, could amost be real.  It  is an old movie but still realivent for today.  The threat of nucular war has subsided but a Military take over still possible.
B000YHE4AG|5.0|I love this movie! It's hilarious, now I can watch it anywhere I go. It's very clear too. Not glitching and all over the place
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|Very good story and the execution is great as well! One of the best animated shows I have seen in recent years. My kids enjoyed it very much too. I've seen it with my kids more than 3 times already!
B0090EHVMC|2.0|Not high quality at all. Not clear, definetly not High definition. I love the movie though, but not when its all, not clear.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I really loved this story. It kept me guessing until the end, except for a nagging suspicion I had for some time. But even though I figured a few things out, it still had surprises. Baldacci wrote a good one.
B00BJZJXWG|5.0|I love music that is a feast for my ears. Just when I think I've figured out all the subtle instruments that have been joined together to create a smooth sound that flows over me I'll hear something new. The layering is exquisite. No single instrument overpowers any others and they blend so well with the vocal sometimes you forget how many people you are really listening to sing and play. &#60;3
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Written without the depth and &#34;connection&#34; I've felt in most of his novels, Safe Haven is still a good read.  good enough that when I learned it was at the movie house locally, I did take and a friend and enjoyed it.  The actress, however, didn't convince me that she had been through any abuse.  So both the movie and the book were perhaps not the strongest of Sparks' works.
B00821OX98|4.0|Developing good characters and has a decent story line. I am not sure how long it can continue but so far it is fun to watch.
0439023521|4.0|I'd avoided reading this for a couple of reasons. 1) the band wagon already looked pretty full. 2) I didn't like the cover very much-it looked too thriller-ish at 1st glance-though, now, I get the relevance. 3) The title even sounded thriller-ish.<br />Anyhoo, I recently won a copy and so ended up with the title in my kindle and thought I'd set about immediately to discover what all the fuss is about.<br />Am I glad I did?<br />Well, duh!<br />Yes, I found the opening to be a bit of a struggle-but I'm well known for my perseverance.<br />Yes, I thought there was a lot to absorb with the way the world was set, and all the different Districts and whatnot.<br />But like with any decent read, the more you read, the more you understand, and the more you want to read-and soon, I couldn't put it down.<br />This turned out to be a cracking read (once I'd come to terms with the present tense narration) and I shall be reading Catching Fire pretty soon.
B001L5YW9I|3.0|Good production values in this film. Also one of the last appearances of Russell Means as an actor. Story is flimsy (as told on screen) and really does JFC a dis-service.
1442419814|3.0|Did I enjoy Uglies? Yeah, I kind of did.<br /><br />Even though I did find it somewhat predictable, I still seemed happy to be reading on, to want to discover what happens and how they deal with a certain situation. But then the certain situation was a fairly unbelievable scene. Hmmm. Okay, let me try and gather my thoughts and compose them--though I warn they may turn out pretty random.<br /><br />Here goes:<br /><br />The entire storyline was predictable. I predicted she wouldn't get to have the op. Predicted she'd end up where she did. That she'd end up liking it and questioning her willingness to complete her mission. That she'd be digging herself a hole the second she started lying. That something would happen to alert the `Specials', and they'd show up, and someone would realise her lies, and that she'd continue lying to David and ... okay, you get the picture. Nothing in the book surprised me because I pretty much saw every single bit of it coming.<br /><br />BUT ... I still enjoyed it. Because the built world was unique, and interesting, and written with conciseness that didn't involve bogging down the pace of the read. I also really liked how the reader isn't hit with all the world details in one go, but is kind of drip-fed them. Like the why of it all--because, I'll admit, that question was forefront in my mind from the off, yet we're not given enough details to fully understand right away. I guess some readers might find this frustrating. Not me. I quite like having some info held a hairsbreadth out of reach so I have to read on to find all the breadcrumbs.<br /><br />So let's chat a little about the characters. Tally grabs the readers empathy from the off, thanks to her having been left behind by not only her best friend, but a best friend who's a boy that we're subtley led to believe she has slightly stronger feelings for than he does. So we instantly feel sorry for her. Instantly want her to find him in that opening scene. And whilst we suspect he's going to be just like all the other Pretties, we just can't help but grab that shred of hope Tally holds that he might have stayed the same. I'll admit, at the beginning, I found the `voice' a little juvenile. But then I reminded myself of Tally's age, and bore that in mind as I read on, and before I knew it, it was no longer an issue. Moving on to David: he's quite an understated dude, but the reader can't help but like him--which is a little odd considering he seems so fickle over no longer holding Shay's hand to kissing Tally. But again, we need to remind ourselves of their age, and it becomes a little easier to swallow. And then we have Shay. She's a cool addition to the book, her bubbliness and attitude are fun to follow. And then near the end, when we see a `different side to Shay'? Whilst sad, it's also pretty hilarious.<br /><br />So yeah, although Uglies was predictable, there was definitely enough in there to keep me reading. And I reckon I'll most likely read Pretties at some point, too.
B0078XGEK2|5.0|Great book on Discipline, Love, Spirituality and Grace. Highly recommended for couples and parents. It will challenge your views on the world around you.
0439023513|5.0|** spoiler alert **<br /><br />Okay. I have literally finished this like 15 minutes ago, so whether or not I'm in a position to provide an opinion not doused in tears remains to be seen. But I shall try.<br />To be honest, if asked for a rating after the first 100-150 pages of this book, I'm not sure I could have happily rated as I have. Yes, I understand there was a lot of non-action activity taking place but I don't think that was the issue. For some reason the opening of Mockingjay lacked a little of the pizazz that Catching Fire wowed me with, almost as though the book had regressed to the slower opening I'd associate with The Hunger Games.<br />But then Peeta showed back up. I did wonder for a while if it was his absence that was bothering me about it. After all, he'd been with the reader throughout-as much a rock to their mental stimulation as he was to Katniss. So for him to show up and it not go quite as my mind envisioned it made me sit up and take note at last. So onward I read. And after spending a tonne of chapters intermittently peeved at Gale for decisions/attitudes he showed, I then began to get frustrated with Peeta. Frustrated over his situation, frustrated because this isn't OUR Peeta-the one we'd all come to love. Frustrated because I couldn't physically do anything to make him okay-just as the characters in the novel didn't seem able to. I wanted Peeta back, dammit.<br />So, the reader is left to deal with their screwed up emotions over Gale, their frustrated emotions over Peeta, and then they have the death of a character to deal with. I'm talking about Finnick.  I congratulate the author on getting me to so readily connect with this character. Because, as though I actually knew him, the moment his demise was certain, my immediate thoughts went out to his lovely female they'd rescued especially so they could reunite, and how his death would affect her in her delicate state of mind. But (luckily, I guess) just as Katniss and the remaining gang don't have time to ruminate over it unless they want to join him, the reader is also nudged along with them and caught up in what comes next.<br />Unfortunately, with one bad happening leading to another, we're not given any reprieve a second time. We're tossed into the separation from Peeta, then the separation from Gale, and just as Katniss is left 100% to fend for herself, she is hit with the cruelist twist of fate she could possibly be pounded with. And just like with Finnick's death when Katniss's lack of time to mull is extendedly stolen from the reader, with Prim's, her lengthened recovery from something so head-screwy means that the reader has no choice but to slow down and absorb the entire shock of it all, too.<br />So basically, by the time Katniss found her way home, and Peeta found it with her, and they once again found what was there all along with each other, this emotional wreck pretty much blarted like a fool. Damn, my kids even wanted to know what I was so upset about. I didn't care that I had my suspicions confirmed about District 13′s dodgy president and was left guessing right up until the very end exactly who she had on her team and was checking out and watching everyone's movements very closely, or that I pre-empted exactly what Katniss would do with that final arrow. None of that matters. What does matter is the authors ability to instil this level of emotional response from me-and that is what well and truly bumped this book back up to its 5 star rating.
B00BMUYLSE|5.0|Very Bowie always something different. Awesome lyrics and rhythms as always with a touch of \\"I'm 66 and still rockin!\\"
B004KZOXJA|4.0|Delirium is certainly a dystopian with a difference. The concept of love as a disease was real intriguing to me, and I enjoyed how the author portrayed the population as `brainwashed' into believing as such, and did so in a believable way.<br />To begin, the story seemed a little slow. I think it took me an entire week to read start to finish. I don't think it was that the opening was slow, because the book as a whole didn't seem like a `fly-through-it' kind of book and the length of time it took to complete didn't really mar my enjoyment.<br />Lena was a likeable, relatable MC, whose innocence in the beginning totally endeared me to her, so I loved following along on her journey as her `self-awareness' developed, and as she grew as a person the more the `veil' shifted from her deluded mine.<br />Alex? *sigh* He was pretty much adorable right from the beginning. Though I did wish more of his confidence we see on first `meeting' him--a confidence that bordered almost on cocky--had remained a little stronger throughout the rest of the read. I was also relieved to find there was a little depth to why he had an interest in Lena, and it wasn't just a case of boy sees girl and his heart decides she's the one. Not to mention the author has the reader guessing over his true intentions thanks to her portrayal of Lena's uncertainties.<br />And then we have the supporting cast. Requisite best friend? Check! A great character addition to the story. Loved the bond. Loved their time spent together. And felt every bit of the heartbreak when things weren't going so well. Somewhat crazed family member? Check! Actually, there were more than one of those, but we'll blame the government for that.  Ally? Check! Again, more than one of those. Although the requisite best friends is a definite ally for sure, I loved the little surprise ally we get right when Lena needs it the most.<br />But what about the plot? Well, like I said, the concept was very intriguing, and I felt it was handled well. My biggest complaint was that there is a `reveal' moment a little later in the book, which then goes on to other turns of events. Once that initial reveal was given, the rest of it became kind of predictable.<br />Oh, and that ending?  I'm very sad. Say it isn't so. Say we'll find out it didn't end as we're led to believe. How can the author giveth with one hand and then snatcheth away with the other? Of course, that is also exactly the reason I will be reading on for sure.<br />So, closing comments: a decent read with likeable and relatable characters, despite their world being incomprehensible (and too sad for words) to the race of today, and a well-built world I'm intrigued to find out more about. Give it a go. And be patient if it ends up taking you a while.
B00BSJ8TX2|1.0|Let me just get that out there,lest you think I am disturbed by violent content. This show strains anyone's suspension of disbelief . They are too sharp to be psychos. WHY would a group of people with this skill set be attracted to an English Professor? Why would they wish to die for him and his warped cause? I frankly, find the show offensive. It insults my intelligence. And , as cute I find Purefoy, I'm not buying what they're selling here.I have an easier time believing in demons and ghosts, than homicidal Lit. Majors ! I feel angry after I've watched. I can't believe it's been renewed. Further proof that all things FOX are suspect.
1476719071|5.0|Beautiful disaster is one those kinds of reads that will stay with you long after you've reached the end. The story is as poignant as it is uplifting, and the delving into the psyche of one of the most unhinged young adults (or new adult, I guess, is more accurate) I've ever read about from the MC's perspective is simply captivating and compelling. I seriously could not put this book down.<br /><br />As disturbing a person as Travis could be, I fell utterly in love with him. Probably because the author did an amazing job of ensuring the reader understood there were more layers beneath his troubled surface, which meant I wanted nothing more than to smooth out his expression every time he had panic in his eyes. And I should have hated him. He's pretty much everything I loathe in a guy. But I just couldn't. I ultimately saw him as the kid he was, desperate for the love he'd spent his entire life lacking, and praying that everything would turn out okay.<br /><br />And let's not forget Abbey (or Pidge). Her character took a while to get a grip of, because she seemed fairly demure, a little shy to begin, despite her no-nonsense attitude toward Travis--possibly because the initial picture painted of her made her seem fairly innocent (good job on the deception there). But we soon learn she's a little more complex than realised at first glance--not immediately apparent, despite the hints of her past--and I really enjoyed watching her character development. And I love how when Travis would be begging her for understanding, I'd wonder what was on her mind and how she would be so harsh until she'd give the reader a subtle reminder of exactly what he'd done to p*** her off in the first place, and I'd suddenly be cheerleading her corner again. I loved how the author had me batting for both teams and all too often torn over who I should be supporting.<br /><br />Plus, let's not forget the supporting cast. Other than Shep & Mare, the rest of the sideline characters were very subtle, and their interwoven interactions were even more subtle, until you don't even realise that you're coming to learn more about them and recognise who they are but are suddenly reading them like their one of your friends/acquaintances as you read through Pidge's eyes. From Fitch, to Travis's friends, to Adam, to Parker, to Travis's family, and even those in Vegas--this has got to be one of the most full-bodied cast of secondary characters ever. Seriously.<br /><br />So what about the plot? Well, those mentions above of f'dupedness? Yeah, that's a major player in the plot, and what the story all revolves around, and how two people who can be so `wrong' when alone, somehow overcome the inevitable explosions that happens whenever they're together (and not always of the good kind), and discover how `right' they truly are when they finally admit they need each other. Not only the character development is awesome in here, but the relationship development is brilliant, too.<br /><br />I abso-freakin-lutely loved it.<br /><br />Only thing I would mention is that, for some reason I thought this was YA (mostly due to their ages), but I would most certainly nudge this into the NA (New Adult) genre due to the sexual content. Otherwise? No complaints. It's thanks to books like this that I find myself reading more and more YA & NA
B008JFUNAU|4.0|i give this movie four stars its not the best summer movie but it does live up to good expections, if you are looking for something that has lots of action big battle scenes then this is not the movie for you. if your looking for a good drama a good story and good hearted fun then this movie is a must see its basically the back story of the wizard and the wicked witch of the west.It is well worth watching.
0439023491|5.0|**spoiler alert**<br /><br />Damn, has this book left me confused and frustrated-both on behalf of poor Katniss.<br /><br />I thoroughly, thoroughly enjoyed The Hunger Games. However, it doesn't quite compete with this one for the emotional turmoil inflicted upon the MC. Emotional turmoil the reader can't help but experience right alongside her. For some reason, I felt a much stronger connection with Katniss in this one. I don't know if that's because I'd already had a full novel with her prior to this, or if I simply related more to what she was going through. But whereas Hunger Games was a thrill-fest to `watch', and the anticipation of what would/could happen next and how the fudge they'd get out of it, and what would happen to Peeta because Katniss being MC pretty much dictated that she had to win all had me turning page after page ... it didn't quite instil me with the OMG moments and tears that Catching Fire did.<br /><br />The first undoing was when the guy from the other district got shot in the head for his support of Katniss. Another-and one of the biggest-was when Katniss stumbled upon poor Gal being whipped. Then her[mini-meltdown-which she was more than entitled to-when she found out she'd be going back into the Games. And let's not forget that horrid moment when Peeta ceased to be alive. Plus, plenty more-which meant I was up and down and fidgeting in my seat like a had a bad case of worms.<br /><br />On top of this, the poor girl (and reader) had to deal with her `love life', and her duelling feelings for Peeta and Gale. Whilst her feelings are evidently stronger/the connection stronger for/with Gale, the bond between herself and Peeta is visibly shifting to one that doesn't only involve winning a crowd over. To me, this would be an impossible decision if she's ever forced to make it (I'd imagine it's coming). Because both guys are totally adorable and courageous in their own way, and totally smitten with Katniss. Even in Hunger Games, despite the majority of the airtime being handed over to Peeta, I still kept thinking `but what about poor Gale', because the author had done such a good job of planting him in my mind. Whilst at exactly the same time, I kept urging Katniss to feel something for Peeta. I'm fickle I know. But in Catching Fire, it pretty much happened all over again. Except this time, I rooted for Gale when he got some of her time-then I switched to Peeta whenever Gale wasn't around. From a spectator's position, the choice is not easy.<br /><br />Oh yes, and one mustn't forget that cliffhanger of an ending. Because anyone who gets this far in the trilogy is, without doubt, now left with no choice but to read on. And I cannot wait.ority of the airtime being handed over to Peeta, I still kept thinking `but what about poor Gale', because the author had done such a good job of planting him in my mind.

B006RJTIF6|5.0|Saw it years ago and with this viewing found it even more exciting and disturbing.  Very well acted and produced.
1416955070|3.0|This is a hard review to write, because I'm not 100% sure how I feel about this book. There were a lot of things I liked about it, but there were also some that bugged me and marred my enjoyment. I'm going to try to organise my thoughts into words.<br /><br />The writing. The book's classified as YA? Is that right? Yet, for the most part, the tone of the writing seemed fairly juvenile. As did the dialogue. These characters are ages 15-17(ish), yet they sounded far too precise in their diction to the point it was almost like reading an old Famous Five book. Actually, the entire story kind of reminded me of Harry Potter & Famous Five combined with a good dose of urban fantasy & action. And seeing as it wasn't set in England, this gave the entire read a slight `off' feel that I couldn't shake even as I went deeper into the tale.<br /><br />Then there was the whole Jace & Clary issue. I so wanted something to develop between them, which it did, so to then be smacked with that whole episode near the end that sullied this line of the story something chronic was just horrid. I spent the entire final chapter of the book waiting for some revelation for it to be wrong. For it to be lies. For everything to be okay again. But that never came.<br /><br />So then I went and did something I never do. I headed off to Goodreads to check out blurbs for the later books in the series. Thankfully, it appears this bothersome affair might get straightened out eventually. However, without that assurance, there's a good chance I would not consider reading on--and folk who read this book when it first came out would not have had that reassurance. I've got to wonder if this bugged anyone else.<br /><br />But those things aside, let's look at why exactly I read on.<br /><br />The world building. The action. The adventure. The characters.<br /><br />The world building was cool. It seemed a lot to follow at first, which is likely why the first 60% of this book was incredibly slow and long-winded(there were a lot of places that could have been culled and a lot of descriptions--especially of urban scenes--that could have been condensed without losing anything yet upping to the pace), but at around the 65%-ish mark, more interesting occurrences began arriving, and the pace seemed to suddenly take off a little, and I found myself better absorbed in the read.<br /><br />The action. See above comment re: pacing. The spot where the pacing picked up was around the same spot we had more action. And once the action began, it seemed to be an ongoing roller coaster of ducking from one situation to the next.<br /><br />The adventure. It was an adventure. From start to finish. But it would have been a much better adventure if the pacing had been better controlled (last mention of it, I promise).<br /><br />The characters. I didn't like Isabelle's character very much, nor her brother. Even when they suddenly acted `nicer' right at the end, I didn't like them very much. Because people don't naturally flick a switch on their behaviour or emotions and just turn it around like that--there needs to be a more gradual build up. However, I did seriously like Luke, and Simon, and Jace & Clary (though I do think Clary is going to end up leading Simon along and then breaking his heart, so I might change my mind on her a little). These four peeps, I'd be interested in reading more about--but only if the pace is faster.<br /><br />That is all.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I enjoyed  the book  Good romantic story. I like this kind of  writing. Not as good as t he Notebook  which is a favourit of mine.
0061245097|4.0|**Warning: Contains some spoilers**<br /><br />What I liked about this book? The fact I've been struggling for weeks to really get into a story and this one suckered me right in from the off. I'm not even mad about the fact that we had to wait so long for Bones' reappearance.<br />Yes, that does sound as though I quite liked Bones in this one. Because whilst he grated on me a little in the first book (mostly his chipper British accent), he was toned down enough in this book for him to not get on my nerves and I ended up quite liking him.<br />So onto what bugged me about the book:<br />- I felt as though the beginning was rushed. The whole deal with Noah felt like a fake setup to add something extra (that didn't seem particularly needed) to the endgame-especially the way the beginning of their relationship (their entire relationship, in fact) was skimmed over to get through the story faster. I think it would have worked better for the plot if Noah had just been left out of it all together rather than trying to force that thread in. It just didn't quite work as smoothly as it needed to for me. I mean, even the well placed cat was barely mentioned again after the event.<br />- I'd have preferred it if Cat hadn't whined about every bit of jealousy she felt over Bones in front of her colleagues. It was a somewhat belittling. I'd have expected better of her.<br />- I wasn't too keen on the whole ghoul idea for wrapping the book up. It seemed to have no relevance in this story, apart from the fact this is where Dave dies. Is his ghoulness going to be relevant later in the series? Just seems as though it was stuck in the wrong place when I can't see the relevance of it here. Maybe he could have been opened up at the beginning of the next book instead. That would have made a decent opener.<br />- I wasn't keen on the time transitions (or timeline jumping, if you prefer). Time passed with little showing of what had occurred during the time. I think maybe they could have beenhandled a bit better. I don't know if this might have been because so much time had passed between the first book and this, and then it felt as though the beginning was being rushed as much as possible to get the reader to the juice. In that case, should the author question if the story was started in the right place? I dunno.<br />- Tate. I'm sorry, I just didn't find his later actions in the book very believable. He declares his feelings for Cat, but then sleeps with a vampire, a species he HATES, as though in a petty attempt to get back at her or make himself feel better. It just didn't gel for me. And seemed to serve no particular purpose to the book.<br /><br />Sounds like quite a few cons, I know. However, the fact I really enjoyed this bookdespite those should tell you a lot.<br /><br />That is all ... I think.  )
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This is a truly remarkable book, one that you will not be able to put down once you begin reading. It is also a tale that you will never forget. Blaine Harden has done the world a tremendous service by recounting, in gripping prose, the unimaginable horrors of the North Korean prison camps, as well as the triumph of the human spirit. It is my hope that this book receives the widest audience possible, and that it galvanizes the international community to do far more to end these atrocities. The world once stated, \\"Never again.\\" What can be done to fulfill that promise?
B008Y6QZ56|5.0|Excellent must see movie. Good actors, great story. Was told I needed to see this movie and now I know why. Highly recommended!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game and every time I play it I feel like a little girl again. Thanks My Horse!:)
B0034G4OYA|5.0|This is a great movie for the whole family.  We really loved it! We watch it often, it's very cute and funny.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|My wife & I love these types of shows - old world era scenery, clothing, ethical views, love of neighbor plus romantic intrigue.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|It took quite an imagination to invent this story. At first I was surprised at so much religion and really started to get into the book when the journey on the ship commenced.  It seemed a bit gory, but after a while the reasons for that all fell into place.  All in all it was believable and unbelievable.  I would recommend it to a mature audience only.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Who would have thought that this would be such a delight.  Now I use it to go to sleep at night.  Love that I can choose or download additional material.  Nice feature to select favorites.  Now I'd like to be able to record some other sounds and add to this app.  Any recommendations?
B008FYZIVY|5.0|My husband and I had wanted to watch this series but hadn't the opportunity - so this was wonderful to allow us to catch up to the present season.  Enjoyed it immensly.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|I am new to Sudoku and now I am hooked.  This is very well developed app and I would recommend it.
B001MM28JG|5.0|Just a fun and overall entertaining movie for all ages!!  I've watched it over and over and never gets boring.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Missed the first part of season 3 so this is exactly what I needed to catch up. Its addicting. Must see TV!
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Love it, it's easy to use and downloaded without problems. Great for kids that know the first two or three letters of a word. When they type them it it gives you a choice of several words. It's a quick resource without running to get the dictionary.<br />It was FREE..................
B00AEBBADG|5.0|Still one of the best movies to watch and the chant of warriors come out to play still is one of the best parts to any movie
B000PMLFRA|5.0|For those who aren't purists, this is a great and affordable option.  Having not seen these movies in years it was a nice option to relive some childhood memories.
B000FBFMIO|5.0|Ms. Hobb knows how to draw characters and move plot.  An immense web that keeps growing in interesting and surprising ways.  Fitz is a true tortured soul who I keep wishing will find his way. JK
B008KNUKVI|5.0|Solid vocals and unique arranging make this a great album.  My kids especially love the first track, &#34;Starship&#34;.  This group deserves lots of attention
B001FVV2X2|5.0|A little disturbing at times, but a unique and thought-provoking show.  I am thoroughly enjoying it.  Many thanks for offering it thorugh &#34;Prime.&#34;
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Love the characters and depiction of class distinctions including values in common.  I am immersed in the journey of the lives in this story.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|The bulk of the book was a great read!  The ending totally fell apart.  It lost the feeling of reality the rest of the book had.  I ended up disappointed.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Love it! Makes me think of the X files, only way more modern! Was offered a free trial of Amazon Prime and I will definitely take advantage of it!
B00936A0RU|5.0|great movie. loved watching it, glad to have it around to watch it again. Shia Labeouf playing a different character for once is good.
B00B1MJ02K|5.0|I saw the special on PBS called &#34;Love in Portofino&#34; and recorded it to watch again.  The music was beautiful, especially in the setting of Portofino.  Passione is not just a CD of the Portofino broadcast, but much more.  The song selections are excellent and Bocelli has never sounded bettter.  He is clearly the best tenor in the world at this point in time.
B008220DGE|3.0|I own Paul Thomas Anderson's \\"Boogie Nights\\" and \\"There Will Be Blood\\" on DVD, and I consider the former one of my very favorite films and the latter to be a confusing yet moving character study that leaves me (perhaps deliberately) a little cold.  I watched \\"The Master\\" for the first time on DVD last week, and I decided to give myself a full seven days before trying to respond to it in a review.  Similar in many ways - and yet ultimately less satisfying - to \\"There Will Be Blood,\\" Paul Thomas Anderson's newest character study is a complex, emotional portrait of a man lost in the aftermath of war, who makes a series of very poor choices, and in the process, gets sucked into and eventually spat out of a cult not unlike Scientology.<br /><br />There is no real reason for me to like \\"The Master,\\" and if it were not for the track record of Paul Thomas Anderson, I doubt I would have ever watched it.  It's bleak, confusing, and a bit troubling, yet I have to admit that I like it, to a degree, though it falls short of being compared to \\"Boogie Nights\\" or \\"There Will Be Blood.\\"  Here's what works - it is beautifully photographed and really captures America in the post-war years with a great deal of detail and mood.  It boasts a wonderful cast, including an actor that I had all but given up on, Joaquin Phoenix.  As much as I love Philip Seymour Hoffman, I do not ever, at any point, understand his character.  And while the brilliant Amy Adams has very little to do during the film's rather bloated 140+ minutes, I enjoyed this change of pace.  Anyone who has seen Amy in her perkier roles will likely be impressed by her morose, domineering presence in this film.  The scene where she rather violently bombards Joaquin Phoenix with a series of sexually explicit language is both memorable and disturbing.<br /><br />In the end, after investing more than two hours of my life into this film, it just did not click.  What begins as a character study of a lost post-war American solider becomes stranger and murkier as it moves along to the point that the ending, if one can call it that, is a complete letdown.  If you're a Paul Thomas Anderson fan already, there is likely something here to appreciate.  I enjoyed aspects of the film, but felt it was too disjointed to love as an entire unit.  Worth a rental, perhaps.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Loved the movie did the book justice. Read the book dozens of times. Love love love love luv can't wait for the others to come out
B008HK3XU4|3.0|This product is very well made however it does not snuggly fit the product.  We went out and bought velcro to attach the kindle to the case so it will not slip out.  I would shop around first before buying this product ---
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Both of my grandsons love this game.  They play everyday from the time thety get up until they go to bed.  If the tablet run out they get another tablet.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|The story &#34;idea&#34; was good.  The story telling was not.  Parts of the story contradicted itself.  Many times the words used were either the incorrect word, or the word was simply used incorrectly.  By the end, I felt the 'hero' of the story had become a whiny little twit that I was actually rooting against.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I am reading all three again. I do not want to put it down! Really great love story. Hot, hot, hot!
B0042VJ1PI|3.0|Just another crime book. Quite fun because its a female cop, but predictable. Not as good as the previous one.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I watched every episode on TV & just had to have my own copy to watch again when I want.
B006JRY2QG|5.0|If you like the 'real', in-your-face series previously found only on Showtime and HBO, you will be shocked with the action and drama of this series.  The series is known for great casting and acting.  You'll find it surprising and shocking, the timid need not watch.  Season 2 is even more over the top, if you're into that kind of thing.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I have seen all three seasons and can't wait for season four.  It would be great if there were more episodes to each season. You will become attached to the characters and Downton Abbey. I love Isis, the dog.
B0088P2A7A|1.0|This would download but, not install on my Kindle Fire HD. It tried to install for days. Had to reboot my Kindle to get it to stop.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|this is a very fun and addictive game on kindle if not try it on pc I bet you'll like it anyways
B004JK61K0|4.0|I really love my Kindle Fire, except when I hate it. Why would I ever hate it? That would be because it doesn't get along well with my e-mail server. Every other device I own is from Apple, and every one of those devices gets along very well with the mail server. It has been a real struggle, however, to find a mail client that makes nice between the server and the Kindle. K-9 is the first app that gets the job done for me in a consistent, reliable manner. It doesn't have lots of bells and whistles; a few, but not so many that they get in the way of what an e-mail client is supposed to do, like send and deliver your e-mails. K-9 Mail is a keeper for me, while every other e-mail client I've tried on the Kindle is relegated to the dust bin.
B001N1DPDE|3.0|Great knife, very sharp. I wasn't a fan of the grips so I removed them and replaced it with some 550 cord.  Do that made it very well balance and more suited for my hand.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Seems to be even more fun than the first.  They can't stop playing it!  It Works great on the kindle.
B007FC3AAI|4.0|This is the fourth installment of the twilight episodes. Now Bella becomes one of them too and just does not know who to love the most. Part 2 just came out on DVD so I will have to get the entire story with that one as well.
B00B2DSK06|5.0|This movie is really fun and engaging.  It's very action packed!  I love Jane Lynch as the action hero.  There is a good message about treating others who are different with kindness, as well as being proud of who you are.  All in all, it's a great Disney flick!
B001FVV2X2|5.0|If you are into sci-fi, this is a great show.  It's reminiscent of X-Files, but the overarching themes and plot are great.  The first season takes a few episodes to get its identity.  I've seen the complete series, and if you haven't it's worth the first go.  If you have, it's nice to start all over again.  allyson/sd
B004S3MB2U|5.0|I really can't think of anything it doesn't have. Every function for every calculation you can imagine, including baking! Great tool!
B009K0P10K|5.0|I am loving this show! The characters are great. The intrigue is better. I can hardly wait for the next episode. I hope this series continues for many seasons. Keep them coming!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I play this game every day wth my daughters. Fun tasks and great graffics.  Pleanty of free content for cheapskates like me. Perfect for girls between 4 and 8.
B0015DROBO|5.0|This book was so amazing it was so hard to put it down! I loved every part of it and I can't wait to read the next two.
B007KAJG3K|3.0|If you like the first one, you will enjoy the sequel.  There is more interplay with Sherlock's smarter brother, Mycroft, and Watson has more action scenes.  Otherwise it's pretty much like the first one.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|Just have to say I love the series, and it's nice to be able to watch it whenever I want. The DVD s are great and there is a lot of extras that come with it. Really enjoy it thanks.
B005LAII1C|5.0|This movie will make you laugh in spite of yourself.  Not only is there a tone of crude, Family Guy-type humor, but there are a lot of subtle jokes and gags throughout the film, requiring you to see it over and over.  It is just too funny.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I haven't anything bad to say about this book.  It got my heart rate up a couple times and it really makes you think and wonder about people....are things as good as they appear on the outside?  Good good book!
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|I enjoy playing the game and it is kind of scary, I guess.  My biggest complaint is that the controls for moving around and looking at things are difficult,  I would like to see a touch pad area in each corner of the screen in landscape orientation,  one for character movement and the other for looking around.<br />  I also wanted to read the notes either before or after they are collected, but I don't see any way to do that because I can't get my character directly in front of the note at eye level before collecting it.<br />  Overall it was fun, but with a little tweaking it could be a killer game.  HAAAAAA, get it?  Killer game?
B009VIZDLI|3.0|Finding the perfect match by using a 'scientific' questionnaire composed in true academic fashion !!<br />Was never going to work but did manage to wheedle out quite a few along the way.........<br />Funny and a bit sad too..
B0071XO8RA|1.0|It's easy to see why the author self-published this book- his very poor writing style, dull plot, and weak characterization would have been rejected by editors a thousand times over. Having said that, I surmise that his success derives from one thing only: the originality of his general storyline, however poorly executed it was. The overall dystopian concept of an entire civilization living in an underground silo has apparently not been done before, and is the only reason I can give this series even one star. We can only hope that Ridley Scott, who surprisingly optioned the film rights, can turn this lumbering, slow-paced read into a compelling cinematic experience. I suspect that was what he had in mind.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|Really good series!!:)<br /><br />Interesting and might be sad for some people but I loved it!!:) you will love this book!!!:)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I really enjoyed this book finished it in less than 48hours.I couldn't put the book down for one second.  You can almost see what is going on.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love playing this game during my free text at my house my brother plays so does my bff I can't wait for the next update
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|awesome!!!!!!!!!!!I love this game and I hope every one else likes it to.please give five stars if you like games.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|I'm an older kid but I love this book. A toddler friend I have and his cousins love it too. It is great.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|When you want to wind down after a mind racking day this fun and relaxing. Just have to be mindful of the clock.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I would enjoy playing Draw Something Free, but it won't stay working on my Kindle.  I've contacted Amazon about it and they've told me how to uninstall and reinstall it...great, but should I have to do this every few days?  It's still on my screen, but won't boot up.
B007N9FKCY|5.0|Where to start... hummm.. oh yeah the music is retro and so lovely, the gameplay is awesome. You can think a bean who jumps isn't the best thing to play right??! WRONG!! It's so addictive and entertaining that you will spend hours playing it without even notice it, my 5 years old boy couldn't stop playing it till he defeated the final boss.. I really recommend this game
B001HBYH9Q|5.0|A rom-com with endearing, quirky characters and great direction. This is especially great to watch with friends because of its quotability. One of the classics.
B008YRVW0I|4.0|Like this game very much. Very addicting. Had to take it off of my phone because it took up too much of my time. Nice graphics and game play. I would recommend this game.
B006YTTVHO|3.0|Could have  been more specified<br />But overall a quality good book, with some interesting points. I did recommend reading it.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|I enjoyed it very much. Denzel is a outstanding actor. I have seen many of his movies, and I have enjoyed them all.
B003U53GK8|4.0|Watched all six seasons on Amazon Prime which worked quit well and is the best bargain in town. I can not imagine watching the series at one per week. It was confusing and I have as many question now as I did at the start of the season, but it was still quite enjoyable. Still don't know who is dead and who is alive.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Season two takes you through the war from the vantage points of men and women excellent show. A must see for history buffs.
B0043ZDU1E|5.0|Her voice is still as powerful and pure as it ever was...maybe even more so. The music familiar, yet exotic.
B009U9S6FI|4.0|So Good, I like how the book flows and Frankel's writing style makes a difficult subject easy to follow and understand.
0861714911|5.0|I find this translation of the Buddha's sutras (from Pali) to be easy to read and impressive. Bhikku Bodhi arranges the sutras in such a logical way for those of us who are new to Buddhism. Read the passages of this book slowly and take time to think deeply about the Buddha's words. Consider them in connection with your daily life. This is a must-read if you are determined to realise pure Mind and attain Nibbana.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Awesome Movie. Watch it. Thats all I have to say. Or you will regret it. Absolutely amazing and worth it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The acting is superb. The storylines are superb. Maggie Smith is outstanding. Mr Bates was vindicated. And then comes the ending..............
B00AQ3W9XC|5.0|His insight into evolution has changed the world. Nothing in biology makes sense without evolution and natural selection.<br />Today his idea is expanded to many other branches of science.
B005PK56TA|5.0|The best thing about AHS is that they keep changing the story every season.  Great script and acting in both the seasons so far.
B002P79KAC|5.0|The Big Bang Theory is one of my favorite shows. Although i'm not a physicist (I'm an Aerospace Engineer) i have a easy time relating with the characters.
B00B7HQ1DA|5.0|Nice to hear Boz Scaggs continue his career with a solid and enjoyable album.  Will play it regularly.  Great stuff.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|The Big Bang Theory is one of my favorite shows. Although i'm not a physicist (I'm an Aerospace Engineer) i have a easy time relating with the characters.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Just watched the pilot episode and really enjoyed it. I have already seen most of the series, but had somehow missed the pilot episode.
B005SAJJHM|5.0|The Big Bang Theory is one of my favorite shows. Although i'm not a physicist (I'm an Aerospace Engineer) i have a easy time relating with the characters.
B000000OF6|4.0|The cd was ok.<br /><br />great songs<br /><br />good music<br /><br />i have no regrets,  its a great band....<br /><br />i prefer de number two disc
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I love the book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Those book is amazing I hope that everyone will like it as much as I did
B008RYN44U|1.0|Ohh it was the worst Cd i ever hear.. bad songs,<br /><br />Just Push and shove was the only one I really liked..<br /><br />i don't recommend to buy..  the previous cds are better
B002S45V32|5.0|Great movie to watch to take you back to your childhood.  Not the best acting, lighting, or filming but it's a fun movie, that'll make you laugh!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I've watched porn that had better character development, plot, and dialogue.  To quote from Billy Madison (which is horrible, but plays like Lost in Translation compared to Fifty Shades).... &#34;what you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.&#34; That pretty much sums up my opinion on this series.....
B008JFUUIA|5.0|All I have to say is -- she's watched this at least 25 times since she's had it. It's safe to say she loves it and knows the music lyrics by heart.
B001TM14VC|5.0|I will take for granted that you have seen OR know the basic premise of Top Gun.<br /><br />What I have to add is my opinion. The dog fights in this movie are amazing. I 100% believe there will never be another movie, with full military participation, that has the the kind of conventionally shot footage appearing in this movie. The sequences are visceral and pull the audience (well me, at least) in. Comedic elements combined with dramatic fill out the storyline. The acting is a bit spotty in places, but it was the 80's...<br /><br />The cast is great too. Tom Cruise, Val Kilmer, Tom Skerritt, Anthony Edwards, Meg Ryan, Tim Robbins, Michael Ironsides. I grew up watching Top Gun replays on cable. I still enjoy watching as much as I did ... 20 years ago... yeah, I said it.<br /><br />We streamed it in HD and the movie looked great. So, what are you waiting for? Just hit that yellow button and start watching.<br /><br />\\"Fox Three!!!\\"
B004BDOJJU|4.0|Although Stardust is a well-written novel in it's own right, I honestly felt like the ending of the film was more satisfactory. Gaiman's prose is beautiful, and there are certain elements in the book that the film lacks (like the SPOILER unicorn) but if you buy the book because you enjoyed the movie, be aware that it's a different story.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|this is one of the best games yet. I just love to play it so much. and its really funny when the police man is in the bunny costume.L.O.L!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best especially when your bored I love to play this game and go against my friend and see who can get the highest score
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|I always liked Air Hockey when it first came out, I can't even imagine the number of quarters I went through playing it with others. This gives the same feel with bright colors along with a number of options for table, paddle, and puck. Being able to play an actual opponet over the AI just puts icing on the cake. The only complaint is that sometimes you'll lose your paddle off your fingertip, but that in no way takes away from the fun. Sometimes it adds to it as you scramble to renew control of your paddle before your opponent scores. I highly reccomend this game, it's one of my favorites.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|I really enjoyed this novel and found it very engrossing. It was the first novel I read this year and the first on my Kindle, so it was a great start. The two sharing the narrative voice was great, and the plot was really well done. I love a good mystery and this was very different from many, making it even more enjoyable. It seems like chick lit on the surface, but is so much more. I have recommended it to many people.
1616550414|5.0|Great buy. Fantastic item. Especially for those who love Zelda. And want to know everything they can about the series. This book has it all.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|This is soo cool! The graphics are exceptional and I love the different themes. I really enjoy the halloween screen and all of svens monster friends along the way. Especially the hand. Awesome.
B000F8O2OM|5.0|My husband loved this birthday preasent so much he is a huge fan of staregate atlantis and sg 1<br />he could watch then over and over
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The board is awesome try to not hit the trains and do not let the man catch u or u will die!!!!!!!
B00243FQFA|5.0|My husband loved this birthday preasent so much he is a huge fan of staregate atlantis and sg 1<br />he could watch then over and over.<br />I would tell anyone one with a sifi love to order this item
B008KE3960|4.0|My son loves the graphics  on the planes.  I don't think it as violent as other &#34;adult&#34; games.  And it was for free.
B00466HM28|5.0|For the Linux users, all you need to do is install from your package repository, Linux MultiMedia Studio or LMM Studio it is for Red Hat Linux and works perfect on Fedora 18 to use the MPK mini left click on the settings icon in the track you are working with and select MIDI / input /[MPK mini device] from the menu you should see the MPK mini listed there and to use the knobs on the mpk mini just right click on the knob in the LMM studio that you want to use and select connect to controller from the menu that pops up then turn the knob on the MPK mini that you want use for control, i have not yet tested it on Debian or Slackware flavors of Linux so if you are using them and are getting different results please write another review. As for Windows users, you need the software that comes with the MPK mini and you need a good synthesizer, i have tested this with FLStudio and it works great but you need to configure the software that comes with MPK mini and the synthesizer there are tutorials on the internet that show you how. i also tested it with the H2 Hydrogen synthesizer and could only get the pads on the MPK mini to work with H2 Hydrogen. P.S. good luck and have fun with it.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|One game I can not put down.  It is very addicting.  Just like bejeweled.  I love playing this game on my Kindle.
B00003CXXP|4.0|I enjoyed this movie a lot. It is full of science fiction/futuristic details all throughout the story-line and kept me interested through the whole movie. Though sad, it is still good.
B007FTZDN8|1.0|Would be a great app but ignores the orientation on the Kindle Fire HD and you have to flip the device over to see the videos. This is the only app I have seen with this problem.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love the character development, love the story. Anxiously awaiting the next season, can't wait to see where the story leads us.
B007HJ96NO|2.0|The opening act of the movie was somewhat charming.  The relationship between the little boy and the projectionist was sweet, and the actor playing the little boy was amazing.  Even in that part of the movie, though, there were too many redundant scenes of overflowing crowds of townspeople enthusiastically watching snippets of movies.  OK, we get it, they loved movies.  But then, the movie went on for another horrendous hour.  Most of that centered on the boy as a (I guess) a teenager.  The actor playing him at that age, in sharp contrast to the first one, had zero range and personality and was dull as a post.  And the scenes just became completely drippy and cliche, and the story completely dissolved.  Essentially, the rest of the movie was just weepy nostalgia for the first act.  And there were many MORE scenes of crowds watching movies adoringly.  And oh, there is sort of a love story, definitely one of the most inane love stories I have ever seen on screen.  And finally, the movie ends with the boy as an older man, now a \\"big shot\\"  (I'm not giving anything away, he is shown in the opening scene of the movie in a fantastic Rome apartment).  Only a throwaway line (and obvious logic) tells us how he became a big shot.  This final section drags horribly and there is no meaningful reveal.<br /><br />So maybe watch it, but just turn it off as soon as you see the teenage actor.  You've basically seen the movie already.<br /><br />Edit: reading some of the other reviews, we must NOT have seen the director's cut that others here saw (even though it said \\"director's cut\\").  There were no scenes of Toto stalking Elena's daughter, no Salvatore sex with a prostitute, etc.  Not sure what happened there.  I guess we saw the original?  Not sure, I think we saw the original.  I'm pretty sure I would not like any version of this movie.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|This book really reminds me of the film The Intouchables which is about a French Aristocrat who has a paragliding accident and then forms a beautiful friendship with his carer. It is similar but of course this is more of a tragic but beautiful love story.<br /><br />Beautifully written, I couldn't put it down. Almost poetic in the fact she went to help him, but in the end he ended up helping her more.<br /><br />Fantastic book.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Baldacci is probably my favorite author at the moment.  John Puller is destined to be another Baldacci hero of many books to come, and I look forward to each of them.
B00AQSN7HE|5.0|Great reboot of the Bond franchise. Anyone who has read the books will see that Craig fits the role perfectly. He is actually physically believable for the role as well..unlike Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan.
B004HD61KE|4.0|I have to admit I just like Rollins' work, and this one was no exception.  I would have given it 4 1/2 stars if that'd been possible
0374275637|5.0|Everyone should read this, especially if you've also read Jonathan Haidt's The Righteous Mind. This is the kind of book that's easy to describe quickly, but to understand what's really going on, you really should just read the book. It's easy to oversimplify, so again, READ THE BOOK!<br /><br />It's written for a lay audience, so it reads quicker than it looks like it would.
075669812X|4.0|It was sold at the great value that I couldn't find in any local store.  Perfect Christmas gift for the Lego Ninjago fans.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This season focus around the events of World War I.  It's terrific to see how the war starts changing the characters.  As I mentioned in my season one post, I do recommend buying the UK Edition.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Great J.J. Abrams action, mystery, FBI drama with a little gore thrown in for fun. It's an excellent show. Once you finish one epidsode, you'll want to watch the next episode.  It's addictive.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The third season is still very compelling.  The focus of this season is the time after the war and the the changing world.  Downton needs to keep up with the changing modern world or be left behind.  As always, I recommend getting the UK Edition.  You don't want to miss those scenes they cut out to fit into the US one hour TV blocks.
B004VD3YIM|5.0|I started with the Free version of this App and quickly upgraded to the Pro version.  It has all the features that I need to control my Foscam FI8910W from anywhere with a WiFi connection.<br /><br />1. Pan/Tilt<br />2. Horizontal/Vertical Patrol (basically back-and-forth monitoring)<br />3. Alert/Alarm settings that email you when motion or send is detected<br />4. Resolution changes<br />5. Reboot<br />6. Sound on/off<br />7. Mic on/off<br />8. Preset camera positions<br />9. InfraRed on/off/auto<br />10. Brightness/contrast<br />11. Zoom in/out (although my camera doesn't support that feature)<br />12. Video Recording<br /><br />All-in-all, it is a great app, very simple to use, and all the features that you need.  I highly recommend this app!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn has captured the essence of issues a middle aged assassin faces and has put a real, human, face on Mitch Rapp! His relationships, thoughtfulness, and lessons from the past shape Rapp's decisions, exuding the perspectives of a normal, highly successful, soon to be middle age man, who happens to be in a highly abnormal career! No easy task for any writer, but Flynn has not disappointed! The aging Mitch Rapp could be &#34;any man&#34; in America, making him so very human, and giving license to us all to have the same introspections! I mean, come on. . . , if America's greatest warrior can become introspective, so can all of us regular guys!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Very well directed and acted.The movie captures the sense of the late seventies  - From US politics to the reality on Iranian streets.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|cheapskate way to exploit fear.  Not science fiction...it has happened that the human race could do this sort of thing.  Have you forgotten the Christians and the Lions?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book!  Lots of action and a good plot.  Saw the movie first and it was very, very close to the book.
B003U4UPTE|5.0|You just don't know what's going to happen next. Love this kind of stuff. Still don't know where their going guess that's why they got me hooked.
B005F2BBLK|5.0|I loved all the play on words and the character reactions.  I can not wait to watch it again soon!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This is the best book ive read in a very long time.  If you grew up in the 80's you will love it.
B001F12J0C|5.0|This was for a gift.  Love the movies myself so I hope I get to borrow them.  Love that Amazon had them and love checking back daily waiting for a price I can live with.
B00459EZLW|5.0|Just wish they would stop teasing us and finish it... Its sad to end a series on a loosing rating system Syfy - But what would you expect..
B004LQGXPA|5.0|As a former army officer, I found the account of Patton in WW II fascinating: he was a conflicted man, but a great and inspiring leader.
B008LFY6NI|4.0|This is a really cool art app.  The only issue is that it gets stuck sometimes.  It doesn't freeze, just gets stuck for a moment and won't spin.  Otherwise, my kids love it!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Well written and informative, but very heavy sexual content.  In my opinion, it was too explicit for teenagers to read.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I use this app all the time. My family loves the beautiful pictures I edit now. I have been using this app to create a scrapbook for my daughter, she goes to college soon.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book is educational, insightful, eye opening, and backed by a ton (not a little) of solid research. I recommend this book to anyone struggling with a chronic illness or obesity that desires to improve their health through diet and reduce their dependency on medications  required to manage symptoms that may be caused by an unsuspecting daily visitor in our diet that we affectionately call \\"wheat\\".
B006GKHE6G|3.0|Ok. This game is more of a showcase for your new phone. The water physics are realistic and beautiful, and the game itself is challenging and fun. but it only has 6 tracks not the described 12. The other 6 are the other just in reverse. it also has not multiplayer witch i think would make the sales of the game go way up. so bottom line. great game, needs more content.
B000G75AE8|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums from slayer. I think I would put this in my third favorite album. Seasons of the abyss and South of heaven was amazing. I love how aggressive the drums and guitars are. What I love about this album of how they point out,how vicious God really is,and how Satan fights back.
B0011Z77OK|5.0|You can't go wrong with the chili peppers. This greatest hits album is awesome! Listen to it all the time.
B0047Y17P2|4.0|This is a very good book in the series by Michael Connelly!  I was excited to figure how it would end!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Can't get enough of the Crawleys and their staff.  Wish their seasons were longer, speaking of seasons isn't it time for Season 3!
B0093H8HXS|5.0|I'm using this in a home server implementation. Runs very well. Quiet, doesn't get too hot. Only wish it had more cores. You get what you pay for!
B006YG9HJE|5.0|The DVD's worked well and I was very pleased with their quality and their condition.  I will buy this way again.
B001B68XRY|5.0|This is a funny football movie with lots of great stars from all walks, football, movies, comedy. If you liked Waterboy, you like this too.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|The second season of this amazing series only gets better as the story progresses. Lying, cheating, backstabbing, love, adventure, and lots of surprises keep the viewer on the edge of their seat from episode 1 to episode 10.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|The background science for this book is excellent.  The main character is likeable and obviously smarter than most of us.  The book moves at a good pace and the story is believable.<br /><br />Why then, did I give it only four stars?  Because the setbacks that occurred happened to frequently, so the reader began suspect that every time things seemed to be going smoothly, adversity would happen.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It held my attention to the end.  I would describe it as a psychological thriller. Good beach book.
B000NTPDSW|4.0|It's nice to have all three films in one package, nicely cleaned up and with good blu ray transfer.  The first of the trilogy is still the best and would get 5 stars, while the sequels would get 4 stars, each.  I guess that makes this review, 4-1/3 stars.<br /><br />I suspect most people know the basics of these movies, so I'll confine myself to saying the video and audio for these movies is excellent and the price, is right, as well.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This app is great.  Very fast. Audio to text very accurate.  Would and have recommended this to family and friends.  I do not think you should have to use 20 words to write a review.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Let's face it.  Downton Abbey is a soap opera that is done so well, by superlative actors, that you forget it's a soap opera.  Great acting is what drives this series.  It doesn't hurt that the photography and sound are superb, either.  I never thought I'd find these folks so interesting.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|I love it. Easy simple to play. Scares me every time. The only thing is I can't find the last page and he catches me every time.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|But I did.  I guess that is what happens when a bunch of excellent actors are put in interesting surroundings and allowed to do their thing.  It didn't hurt that the story was fascinating, as well.  The portrayals of all the characters were simply outstanding.
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|Seth MacFarlane is his regular offensive self in this live action \\"Boy turns to man, and grows with his teddy\\" film. There's always been films about a boy and his dog, where things are lovey dovey and \\"typical.\\" But in Seth's Ted, you get the more \\"grownup\\" style.<br /><br />I did find this film much funnier than MacFarlane's animated series, \\"Family Guy.\\" The same jokes can be found, but the overall comedic performances of Kunis and Wahlberg (well mostly Wahlberg) make up for Ted's  crude jokes (aka. Peter Gryffin). There were some moments of uncomfortable funny parts, but not enough to ruin the flow of the movie.<br /><br />Definitely not suitable for younger children, even though there is a cute looking teddy bear as a supporting character.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|This movie excels in so many ways, but special mention should be given to the cinematography, direction and acting.  Visually, this is pure eye candy.<br /><br />From the standpoint of direction, with one small exception, it is flawless.  That flaw is the scene in the family's cabin while the ship is in very heavy seas.  Pi is leaning over the side of his bunk, arm hanging down, but there is no suggestion of motion.  What I can't decide is if this was intentionally done to make the severity of the storm a form of shock and awe, or simply, an omission.<br /><br />The acting, especially all the age variations of Pi, was spot on.  everyone performed well.<br /><br />The CGI in this film was outstanding.  You would be hard pressed to tell that wasn't a real tiger.  The 3-D was good throughout, with no obvious attempts to get oohs and ahs.<br /><br />The storyline, for reasons that become apparent has some inconsistencies, but that is as it should be.  A well told tale.
B0080M3OGW|5.0|this is a simple story, nothing complicated about how these two characters fall in love - they just do.  the relationship does not appear passionate in the beginning of the movie but it is definitely love at first sight.  there is restraint between the two of them but you feel this strong attraction and yearning for one another immediately and it remains a constant throughout the movie.  and, what could be better than watching these two accomplished actors perform together?  the movie has aged beautifully...a romantic soul at any age would love this movie or what most &#34;guys&#34; nowadays would call a &#34;chick flick.&#34;
0062200909|5.0|The artwork is stunning and presented in an interesting and informative manner.  A great compliment to the movie.  I don't often get books like this, but the art and design of Peter Jackson's movies tends to  be superb.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|I have a old style ipod 30 pin 12 volt cable in my 2010 scion tC. I never knew this was out and always wished and wondered if I could find something that would allow the car to charge my iphone while plugged in playing music. I love this thing. My cupholder coin thingy has a slot for a ipod/iphone and the cablejive sticks up in the air and makes it harder to hold when changing songs on pandora, but no longer do I lose juice driving down the road listening to the battery draining internet radio. No more dead phone, ever!
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This book is a moving first person account of early onset Alzheimer's.  The book explores her struggle with the diagnosis and her increasing inability to hold on to the &#34;Alice&#34; she was.  But what will move your to tears and at the same time feel hopeful is how Lisa Genova draws the relationships as her family comes to grips with her illness and the impact on them.  A must read book.
1603427244|5.0|The pictures in this book are precise, as are the instructions....even I can understand and replicate them....highly recommend this guide to anyone looking for clearly illustrated images!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|You would think that after 6 seasons, this should would start to degrade in quality.  However, unlike other shows, this one seemed to thrive in its sixth season.  They are really pushing the bar and keeping expectations high.  The show also does not rely heavily on past episodes (except in the case of a couple of the to be continued ones).  So one could jump in at any season / episode and still enjoy it.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Interesting movie to watch, but just don't expect it to be all about a plane crash (though the crash scene is fairly well done and powerful if a bit ridiculous on the unrealistic side). The movie is tough to watch but engaging overall. Some great bits of humor here and there to break the over lying dark side of the film.
B002QNBRXS|5.0|I am not sure one can call themselves a Dexter fan without having seen this season.  I won't say what happens or give away any plot.  However, I will say that this season is a must see.
6305212112|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies and have watched it several times.  Always seem to see something different in the movie.
B000IDEORY|5.0|I love this movie . Patrick Swayze is absolutely brilliant in it, as well as Jennifer Grey. Two unlikely people finding love and the dancing is outstanding! I highly recommend this movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Good game to pass the time. Nice graphics as well. Was really impressed with the game play features although training takes a while
B009UX2YAC|1.0|There were no instruction about how to play this game.  I was quite dissapointed and deleted the game from my device
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Oh man you need a shower after each episode.  I loved this show when it was on FX.  I remember just how damn gritty this show can be.<br /><br />People portrayed from the angle of the lowest form of scum and then you find out there is LOWER!  Really good cop show with tons of sub plots.<br /><br />There're are Good Cops....Bad Cops.......and then there is Vic Mackey........he's a Different kinda cop
B009KHCT94|4.0|This film states some historic truths about hitler and his crazy reign for power, where they went afterward no one knows. but the funny side is that they colonized the moon before anyone even the Russians lol. As well the Black man was a model but as well turned Michael Jackson bleached skin so that he could be more excepted, but the white woman like his dark skin. That was a funny movie.
B006C67NP6|5.0|I had a little trouble installing it at first but figured it out.. Lots of fun to mess around with. I should have bought Pro but somehow ended up with the B version that isn't as good but the same price.
B00BESNKB8|5.0|Like the eutectics cinematography and visuals the effects where great too. Great film, lol a Black moor in China who escaped from slavery a slavic black man very funny stuff as well he knew martial arts some how. Great film and believable film as well.
B0086VWCPG|5.0|Before I purchased this for my Android phone, I would only walk the same one or two paths over and over again because I knew exactly how far it was so I could be consistent and not overextend myself or my dog. With Runtastic I can create routes beforehand and see exactly how far it is going to be OR I can just take off and go and it will tell me how far I have gone at any time. One benefit I didn't realize it offered when I bought it is that while I have it on, my husband can tell where I am, by logging into the site. We are seniors so this is a wonderful safety measure as well.
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|It had a crazy story one of the same in most hollywood films same story not being excepted by not playing his role that is the US programed type story of colonization. Very funny though it had me laughing on how a male cartoon figure wanted moore out of life but the system did not want him to do such but to stay in his own role.... funny stuff....
B000FC0OOU|4.0|I apologize for a mistake here - my review was for  \\"Winter in Madrid\\" by C J Samson - as you can see I went to read Hemingway afaterwards<br /><br />Flash backs and forwards not immediately possibleto say when and where one is in the story. I should have read the history of the period before  opening it as if one is not genned up on the history of the Spanish civil war and after, is not easy to orientate  one self in the book<br /><br />I read Hemingway again afterwards and I think one can say that the author did good documentation.
B00B6LS9HS|5.0|Man these guys have hit it out of the park on this one. Not a single throw away track on here. This is AOR at its best! JSS is one of the best singers out there and the harmonies they put together on the choruses are amazing.If you are reading this review don't even hesitate buy this album it will not disappoint!
B007PVHMCG|5.0|My son was so excited when he opened this on Christmas morning.  Thanks so much for offering this item for purchase.
B008X6N1OA|5.0|the movie is very enjoyable to watch,very funny and will keep you laughing all throught the movie,the 3d affect are well done,great picture making a lot more fun to see
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Love this app except when it comes to typing.  I have had it lose what I've typed because there is a small window and if you try to do some editing and accidentally touch the edge of the window, boom, all you typed is gone.  Ticks me off when I just spent 10 mins composing something and it's all gone and I have to start from scratch.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|There is absolutely nothing wrong about this show.  It's wonderful. Wonderfully written, acted, cast, location.  Everything! It is very well done!
B00024I2Z4|5.0|It my favorite movie watch it more than 100 times when I was little I really love it! I got it on time!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This keep the kids and the paretns occuiped on a long road trip and made the time go by with no complaining
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|My mom loves Columbo so when I saw this series I could not resist. I bought it along with a few of her other favs and she loves it. This item was delivered very swiftly!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This help dad pass some time while sick and on a road trip to make him relax and keep him occuiped
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Really a good read. You get to know the characters more in depth.  It explains a lot of things,  and you see this relationship with the two develops.
B000B5XOYI|5.0|This was a great brithday gife for a kid and he love it he has the complete set and watch it all the time
B00594XOZU|1.0|I added this app thinking that it would be good because of the reviews but it wouldn't register me it. Kept saying try again later<br />Don't get this. App
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This help on a long road trip and keep the kids and parents occuiped for the whole trip it was worth it
B004UID2LC|1.0|if you think you are going to be able to look up videos and download them, then im pretty sure you're wrong unless i didn't look hard enough but i couldn't find it so i do not recommend this app
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I've read books about dog, but Stein's vision blew my mind. His vision of Enzo was more than just a dog, he felt human. And the human voice really drew me in. I loved it.
B0095P29EG|4.0|I'm not generally a big fan of the superhero movies, but this one was pretty good. I'm not saying it's one of my favorite movies, but I found it to be an enjoyable evening of movie watching.
B00992CF6W|5.0|never been a huge minecraft fan but on the kindle fire its easy to carry around and play sp I don't tat bored
B000JQUMPI|5.0|A book filled with love and sorrow! I love this book! Wish I was one of the little women. I am always going to miss Beth!:(
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I have read all the books with the character of Pendergast and have never been disappointed.  This book had an interesting and strange storyline.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|Years ago when these scanners came up, we had one similar to the VuPoint, which is a considerably more expensive unit than this film and slide scanner.  I'd load four slides into a plastic mechanism and try (the operative word is \\"try\\") to get individual slides centered.  It was a very difficult process to master, to say nothing of the crack I got in the plastic.  With that type of mechanism it was simply an accident waiting to happen.  And it did.<br /><br />I was frustrated with the process and in spite of the hundreds of slides we would have loved to work through, I gave up.  It was a labor-intensive process that didn't work for me.  This little film and slide scanner, however, does work for me.  We're quite excited at the prospect of being able to work through our slides.  We have kindergarten slides, field trip slides holiday slides, vacation slides ... you name it we have them.  They only come out once in a great while to be shown the old-fashioned way.  The projector and screen haven't seen a lot of use in some time.<br /><br />We've tried this film and slide scanner on a few slide and were quite impressed.  The directions are very clear and include visuals, which I find extremely helpful.  For example, if you wish to use the Mirror/Flip keys you can see a photograph of the keys you will be using and photographs of the results of using the keys.  The step-by-step instructions are quite useful as this is not an intuitive device for many people.  We're hoping to be able to take our USB card over to Costco and convert many of out pictures to photographs, photographs many people in the family have never seen.  There are [[ASIN:B00A6GROIO DB-Tech Replacement Film Holders]] also available on Amazon, an item I'd suggest picking up when you order this film and slide scanner.<br /><br />WHAT'S IN THE BOX:<br /><br />~  Film scanner<br /><br />~  USB cable<br /><br />~  Filmstrip holder<br /><br />~  Single frame film holder<br /><br />~  Film retrieval strip<br /><br />~  AC Adapter<br /><br />~  User manual<br /><br />FEATURES:<br /><br />~  6cm (2.4 inch) LCD screen<br /><br />~  5 mega pixel sensor<br /><br />~  Film holder<br /><br />~  32MB internal memory<br /><br />~  2 in 1 card reader (SD/MMC)<br /><br />SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:<br /><br />~  Windows XP, Vista and Win 7<br /><br />~  Pentium MX 350MHz or higher<br /><br />~  USB Port<br /><br />TECHNICAL SPECS:<br /><br />~  Lens:  F/NO=r f=3.93<br />~  Sensor:  5.1MP CMOS<br />~  Liquid Crystal Display:  2.36-in LTPS Display<br />~  External Memory:  SD/MMC Card (32MB Max)<br />~  Internal Memory:  16MB<br />~  Exposure:  Automatic<br />~  Color Balance:  Automatic<br />~  Scan High Resolution:  10MP Interpolation Resolution<br />~  Data conversion: 12 Bits Per Color Channel<br />~  Scan Method:  Single Pass<br />~  Light Source:  Back Light (3 White LEDs)<br />~  LED Lifetime (on and off)  10,000<br />~  Power:  USB 5-volt Adapter<br />~  Interface: USB 2.0<br />~  Dimensions:  4.76\\" x 3.78\\" x 2.17\\"<br />~  Weight:  8.5 oz.<br /><br />Sample provided by the distributor./>~  AC Adapter<br /><br />~  User manual<br /><br />FEATURES:<br /><br />~  6cm (2.4 inch) LCD screen<br /><br />~  5 mega pixel sensor<br /><br />~  Film holder<br /><br />~  32MB internal memory<br /><br />~  2 in 1 card reader (SD/MMC)<br /><br />SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:<br /><br />~  Windows XP, Vista and Win 7<br /><br />~  Pentium MX 350MHz or higher<br /><br />~  USB Port<br /><br />TECHNICAL SPECS:<br /><br />~  Lens:  F/NO=r f=3.93<br />~  Sensor:  5.1MP CMOS<br />~  Liquid Crystal Display:  2.36-in LTPS Display<br />~  External Memory:  SD/MMC Card (32MB Max)<br />~  Internal Memory:  16MB<br />~  Exposure:  Automatic<br />~  Color Balance:  Automatic<br />~  Scan High Resolution:  10MP Interpolation Resolution<br />~  Data conversion: 12 Bits Per Color Channel<br />~  Scan Method:  Single Pass<br />~  Light Source:  Back Light (3 White LEDs)<br />~  LED Lifetime (on and off)  10,000<br />~  Power:  USB 5-volt Adapter<br />~  Interface: USB 2.0<br />~  Dimensions:  4.76\\" x 3.78\\" x 2.17\\"<br />~  Weight:  8.5 oz.<br /><br />Sample provided by the distributor.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|best book yet, awesome cliffhanger ending, and there is not a single boring part. Rick does what he does and writes awesome books
B005HEQ4XQ|5.0|Season 6, in my opinion was the best in the entire TNG series.  It may be the best sesion in the entire Star Trek franchise.
B008XG1X18|5.0|APP WORKS GREAT, WELL TILL I  DID A RECENT UPDATE! NOW WHEN I REPIN OR WANT TO LOOK AT A PIC IT SAYS FORCE CLOSING A LOT MORE OFTEN THAN BEFORE I UPDATED THE APP. I COULD TOLERATE IT BEFORE BECAUSE IT RARELY HAPPEND BUT NOW ITS JUST ANNOYING!  PLEASE PLEASE FIX THIS PROBLEM. OTHER THAN THAT, IT WORKS GREAT!  LOVE U PINTEREST!!! :)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game.  I am having so much fun trying to keep my guy alive and not running him off a cliff or smacking into a giant log or getting fried.  The graphics are really good and it really gets my heart pumping.
B009FZFONO|3.0|Season 1 and 2 were awesome.<br />This season seems thrown together and lots of errors in continuity. There are three more episodes before this season is over and I really hope it goes out with a bang because this season has be dragging along.
B0060MYM3S|4.0|Not as good as season one...but still really great.  Gets better as the episodes progress.  Wish it had been released earlier.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|To say I loved this book is not correct. I appreciated all that I learned about North Korea and felt a deep respect for the main character. The hardships these people endured were beyond my scope of imagination. The author did a tremendous job with this work of fiction that seemed so real to me. It was important to keep plugging along as it did give great hope at the end.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Very slow moving story. Dragged out!!!! Only struggling to finish it because I don't quit a book. But, you could definately find better books to read!!
B009DJB8I2|5.0|Brilliant soundtrack but correct me if I am wrong, but the entire thing is also available straight from Valve for the price of FREE. Bit odd to see it here for money.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|Love the special effects and action this delivers to its viewers, especially the scene where he wears special suction gloves to climb up the building, looks so real.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This app saves me so much time. I have tried so many different keyboards and this is by far the best that is out there. Highly recommended. A+
B00B3MN65K|4.0|This is not my favorite album but there are a few songs that are worth getting the album for. Great music to relax to!
0547884591|3.0|I love the other 4-Hour books but after reading this whole book i was left with the 'meh' impression.. and that's it! IMHO it does not hold up the same standard as the 4-Hour body in terms of useful information (probably just my own tastes, you may love it). However, this book taught me how to consistently make the most delicious stake I have ever eaten. Value for the whole book is right there! - seriously it's amazing.<br /><br />As a cook book, it's awesome. For the Tim Ferriss standard - meh. Take everything with a grain of salt, it may just be your perfect book, it just wasn't mine.
B00AA0TZTW|2.0|I am a Jimi Hendrix fan, but to be honest, I do not like this release. Some of the songs just sound \\"thrown\\" together and lack the fire that we'll all used to hearing Jimi unleash. Another reviewer sum it up best...sounds like a studio jam session. I am glad to hear there will be no more future releases of \\"newly discovered\\" material. This release is for the completest only. R.I.P Jimi.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Long book, fun to read if you also love the movie and the story in general. I just wanted to clarify what I remembered of the story before going to the movie.
B00AB0Z88S|4.0|But once I was trapped on a 15hr flight to Australia a few weeks ago I decided to give it a try.I truly enjoyed this movie.I really felt like I wouldn't and guess I even went in trying not to.Its a good movie with lots of moments of life's reflection.Well worth seeing.
0385342063|4.0|This not Sophie's best work but It is a fun read.  Funny story line mixed with a bit of mystery. However, I do felt that the plot was a bit of forced. I meant, you can get a prepaid phone in a convenient store nowadays.  Do you really need to pick up a phone from the bin?
B008PWUXQQ|4.0|He is using it so I guess that is a good sign  Made well and sturdy.  I'm not sure how it works when you stand the kindle up because he hasn't used it that way - or I haven't seen him use it that way.  I take no complaints as a big plus.
B002KKCVX2|4.0|Sandals looks nice.  They seem well made.  They are comfortable out of the box.  A more thorough evaluation after a year of use.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Oh what a twisted web Stephen King can weave. Interesting, complicated, and entertaining all the way through. A must read!
B009RI4FRU|5.0|It was great to see a movie that wasn't all blood and guts.. Plus there was not a lot of cursing.  It was a breath of fresh air.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is a very easily used calculator app. I use it when I have math and am too lazy of comfertable to get up!!!!!:)
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I can't believe I just started watching this series this year.  I can't believe how addicting the shows are.  I think I completed one full season in three days.
B007C3TVNA|3.0|Many of the actors and actresses concerned do a very good job Tilda Swinton for one as Kevin's mother but also new arrivals Jasper Newell and Rocky Duer who as young versions of Kevin were far more effective  then Ezra Miller's teenage version  Who comes across as more lethargic then evil.<br /><br />I also have to spare a moment to say that I just didn't like John C. Reilly in this movie he just sucks the life out of any scene he is in he is a great actor when he can find a movie to fit his talents but he misses the bulls eye big time with this one<br /><br />These are somewhat minor quibbles with the casting on my part the uphill fight that both the book and the movie but particularly the movie never deal with are the actions on the part of Eva Khatchadourian or rather the lack of action on the part of Eva Khatchadourian.  I think we can safely assume that the family is at least comfortably upper middle class therefore any rational person would be curious if you have a child that you feel is just a \\"bad seed\\" from the beginning why do you not take advantage of an entire branch of human psychology study and take the child to a mental health professional of some kind?  You can't just say that \\"Oh Kevin is really good at manipulating people\\" because even that over a sustained period of time would raise red flags in the real world suspension of disbelief only goes so far.  While The overwhelming majority of the blame for Kevin's behavior pattern has to be with the mother that would disregard how Kevin's mother is treated in the end quite unfairly not just once or twice but almost constantly by probably 95% of the people that she meets.  I really find myself coming down on her side here Kevin is responsible for Kevin's actions not his mother.  Why doesn't she report the actions of the vandals to the police?  Why does she not have some manner of police protection?  Why does she put up with casual assaults on the street?  Why doesn't she just move?  I guess we are supposed to think she allows all of those things to happen because she feels guilty for giving birth to a monster but that is really the problem right there by the end you feel bad enough for this woman you don't need more reasons to sympathize with her every two minutes after awhile they just feel manufactured.<br /><br />Overall-Don't expect a modern day parable on the nature of good and evil appreciate the great cinematography if you are inclined but in terms of plot just expect to be confused
0307719219|5.0|This is the most important book for the public to understand why some nations become wealthy, and others do not. And it is a powerful warning about how to kill the goose that laid the golden  egg.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|When I started the third book I wasn't that interested, it took me maybe a third of the book before it kept me wanting more but well worth it in the end.  Even though parts were making me frustrated, I really enjoyed it!
B00820N2JG|2.0|This is a movie that pokes fun at America's position in the world and hollywood at the same time. Frankly, I wasn't feeling it. If a movie has to rely on being crude to be funny then is it really funny at all or just crude?
B003O86FMW|4.0|The first one I liked way more but this was a nice quick read.  I continue to like the characters and how everything is evolving.  Can't wait to read the next one.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is so easy to find any location with a couple of strokes.  And, I like the way I can change versions when I want to see a different translation of a verse.  The best I have tried!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put this book down,  great detail love the way it came across in my head & then to see the movie made it that much better.
B009O2XY12|2.0|sure it is fun but then it starts to ask for money! it may be a free app but it isn't later
B008JGSM6G|5.0|When you start at the lower levels it seems easy enough but as you move up through different levels the puzzle's become very challenging!
B004LROUNG|5.0|Grisham makes it scary, but as a lawyer I have to say I have run into crazy nuts like the ones in &#34;The Litigators.&#34;  If they don't act quite as wild as Grisham's lawyers do, it is only that they are afraid to be disbarred or arrested -- not that they wouldn't do the same crazy stuff if they thought they could get away with it.  Too may real lawyers are like Grisham's in that they are living from case to case and will do anything, including rip off naive clients, to get a few bucks in their pockets to temporarily pacify the IRS and allow them to pay for the next &#34;expert witness.&#34;  That being said, I have to say that the most honest -- compulsively honest -- attorney I every knew was a guy named Jerry, a disbarred NJ lawyer.  I don't know what he was disbarred for, but in his &#34;advisory&#34; work as a wills and estates man, he was the fairest, most honorable person I've ever worked with.  I mention this because the law is a wild profession where it's hard to tell the good guys from the bad guys.  Grisham captures this in The Litigators.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book--even though I'm no young adult. I found myself pulled into the story and rooting for the characters. One criticism is that the end felt really rushed and thrown together. After investing so much time into the characters, that was a bit disappointing.
0553801473|2.0|Martin's long winded story telling is getting very old.  He REALLY needs to trim down all the useless descriptions and back stories, getting more to the story line.  I have started skipping whole pages at a time just to get to the story line.  The first couple books flowed well, even though the long descriptions were there too, but at this point, it almost seems like he's dragging this out to sell a couple more books. He is not progressing as a writer, or getting more precise in his telling. I may just wait on the cliff notes for the last 10 books he's going to write in this series.  I'm losing interest.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|First thing I've ever read by Rothfuss, and I couldn't put it down! Can't wait to read more by him!
B00BP4Z8XY|2.0|I was watching with six people from ages 13 to 63 and all of us commented that it was hard to get &#34;into&#34;,  the three young teens thought it was just &#34;lame&#34;.  5 of the 6 people had even played some of the games talked about, so not knowing about the &#34;older style&#34; computer games was not the problem.
B002ZG981E|5.0|This movie is so visually appealing that if you do not buy the blu-ray version, you are cheating yourself.<br />You need to experience all that this movie offers in the best possible quality.
B00BESM14U|5.0|Watched this movie with my 16 year old son and we really enjoyed watching it together and discussing what was happening. We loved everything about this movie! The roles were well cast, the acting was fantastic, the soundtrack was great, and the story was well told. I would highly recommend it!
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Great Movie! Loved every second of it! Highly recommend.<br />Rented via Instand Video and was easy to set-up. No interruptions.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|As I read this, I could see how it would make a terrific Action Movie.  The pace  is quick and engaging.  The characters are strong and it is a joy to read.  My only complaint is that I figured out &#34;who done it&#34; before the end.  But this still had an ending that was unexpected<br />I thoroughly recommend this book
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This movie is amazing. The Blu-Ray quality is absolutely worth the price.<br />Definitely the only way to watch this movie!
B00456PKG4|4.0|A rollicking fantasy-adventure, with lots of action, daring feats of skill, a malevolent and treacherous adversary, AND romance. Enjoyable way to spend an evening.
B00499NHLC|4.0|The show updates Sherlock to modern day.  I like that Watson is still an Army doctor, and has his own issues.  I especially like the overlay of what Sherlock sees.  This allows you to get the information without wasted dialog explaining things.  All in all, a much better update than the American version
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Good overall.  Entertaining beginning.  Better than expected.  The author does a nice job of story telling in addition to throwing in interesting facts.
B0081336FO|4.0|Season two continues to provide a fine version of Sherlock Holmes.  I find the stories to be engaging as well as the characters.  What more can you ask of a show?
B007WPM7SO|4.0|This was a pretty good watch. I read the book and loved it. I was not disappointed. I would recommend.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Mostly relaxing game. some of the higher levels with the 'tether' can be a bit frustrating though, but overall it's great. I have this game on my Nexus 7 tablet also and it runs better on that one. On this Kindle Fire it gets jumpy and stuttery sometimes. I just don't think the Kindle has the video processing power to handle it correctly. It works good enough though. You only notice it once in a while. I picked this up as the faotd, but definately worth paying for if you missed it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Our family has thoroughly enjoyed this miniseries.  The setting and period costumes are wonderful.  The characters are entertaining and thought provoking to watch.  Interesting taste of what life was like during that era.
B006E4QCXU|3.0|Really? $1.99 ?? how long can you really play with this thing? 20 seconds? 30?  It's not a game, there's nothing to do except drag your fingers across the screen. BORING!!!!!!!!!!!! Maybe if it came wit a dozen free hits of acid it would be worth it :)
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey provides incredible entertainment with its superb ensemble cast.  Each cast member's life is explored; no one is left as a marginal character.  Maggie Smith is delectable.
B002QNTNL6|5.0|If I'm sick very long, this is definitely in the list for recuperation.  Imagine my surprise when my young-no-longer husband chose it for Valentines watching--very sweet of him, and he enjoyed it too.  Nothing objectionable.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game u should not listen to anybody that says this hame sucks it is more like a girl game and i wouldnt reccomend this to any kids under four without supervision because there r some things u can buy with real money right out of ur pocket
0394800184|5.0|great quality and cheeper than most places. arrived in a decent amount of time. i would recommend this too others.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Absolutely LOVE this book!!! I couldn't stop reading it, stated up almost all night just to get in a few more chapters. The entire story keep our me on my toes wanting more and more of these characters. I love Travis, even though he is a complete nut case. Abby and America .. their relationship by far is the greatest best friendship.
B00AEQYM6S|5.0|Jonas Kaufmann has become one of my very favorite tenors. In this recital of Wagner &#34;arias&#34;, he delivers beyond my expectations and makes me hungry to see him as Parsifal as well as Siegfried. Certainly the &#34;Wizard of Bayreuth&#34; would have been most satisfied with this recital!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|What a great game! I love any adventure game,but this one definitely will not let you down.  The storyline is well done and the graphics are beautiful! The only bad part about it is that it ended to soon! I can't wait to see what they come up with next,hopefully a sequel! LOVED IT!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Loved the book, was not expecting the ending. It was definitely a page turner. Made for great discussion at book club meeting.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I did not like this book because I couldn't find the world I was looking for ((I'd rather use a POCKET DICTIONARY us I said it this one I can't even find slimed)
B0063GORYU|1.0|I had this loaded n played everyday n enjoyed it. then a few days ago there was a update. now the stupid add screen pops up after every play asking to rate. a box u check say's Don't ask again. I check but still pops up To Annoying I deleted app n will find another. Why can't u MobilityWare people leave good things alone. so stupid.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Waiting for each new episode is like waiting for the IRS to give you your tax refund. But once you get it, it's worth every painstaking minute. Bring on Season 4. By the way, If Daryll dies we riot.
B0095P29EG|3.0|Not really my venue. There are a lot of movies I would prefer over this style of movie but it is a trend.
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|Pink's book is a must read for anyone who wants to make a lot of money selling.  He is able to give reasons why buyers buy and how to decipher the signals that buyers send seller unintentionally.  Lawyers should read this book as their new world demands that they meet and exceed the buyer's expectation.
B002GZQYMK|4.0|Muse's fifth album establishes them as one of the best and progressive rock bands in the world.  Their ambitious effort to make grandiose anthems works well on this album.  The opening track \\"Uprising\\" offers a solid base riff and will infuse fits of anxiousness throughout your body.  Bellamy uses vague terms in the chorus incorporating everyone to rise up and not accept the fate that they have been given or the one the world wants to give them. This is an excellently crafted rock song.  \\"Resistance\\" is another wonderful piece of music opening up with a piano riff that is amazing.  The song slowly builds to the chorus with Bellamy shrieking \\"love is our resistance\\".  \\"Undisclosed Desires\\" another ambitious song and something different to what you would normally hear includes a pounding drum beat and electronic guitar riff.  Those are the big three that were played on the radio and all are good in their own right.  The rest of the album is pretty good, my particular faves are \\"Unnatural Selection\\", which feel like \\"New Born II\\" and MK Ultra which is another upbeat rock song.  The opera at the end is what makes this album stand out to me a three part sequence linking everything together with strings and keys.  I love Muse and the vision and creativeness they have.  I have seen them twice live and would highly recommend you check them out as it is a life changing experience.  Few rock bands have the showmanship and theater in their live shows as much as Muse does.
0743270754|5.0|Have not read, but saw the movie. Today things have not changed much. Egos, Agendas, and lots of nothing. Male country club.
B000SEI230|4.0|An excellent book filled with great spiritual reflection. Gives each of us a reason to look deep within our soul.
B000J1AGQI|5.0|Excellent movie, very moving and excellent acting by Mel Gibson.  I would have bought the Bluray version but wasn't available.  I highly recommend this movie.
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|I feel confident to have it around to protect my Plantronics HD.You have to be disciplined to use it,because otherwise, it will be in the drawer all the time...
B0038LB4TE|5.0|I really enjoyed this one a lot! the whole story is done beautifully, analytical and fast paced.<br />It also has some of the best dialog ever! When Reacher is interrogated by the agents, the answers are so brilliant, you want to read them again right away!<br /><br />One of the best Reacher novels.
B004EF65QA|5.0|This is a beautiful love story. The acting is superb. I truly believed the emotion of the characters. The ending to this series in my top 3 favorites. I watched the ending 6 times. If you love Pride and Prejudice, you'll love this movie!
B0031RSBS2|3.0|Reacher novels are great and extremely good to read. This one was not the most compelling story ever, but still a good read. The best parts in Nothing to lose are when Reacher gets into his fights, the story telling is always fast paced, analytical and brutal.<br /><br />Not the best Reacher ever, but still far better than average.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I am enjoying playing Spider Solitare. I play it over and over. It is a great passtime when I am bored. This game is so much fun.
B008UX2UIO|1.0|I, like most of the 1 star reviewers, had heard so many good things about this book. So many authors and comedians had said it was the funniest book ever written, so it was such a let down to be so utterly sad. Were we supposed to laugh at these characters? Find humor in their misery and mental illness? Onanism to thoughts of a pet isn't funny... it's disturbing. The book is one disaster after another, and just when you think things are finally going to get better/resolved it just ends.  The only remotely comedic parts of the whole book were Ignatious' interactions with Dorian, which are too few and far between.<br /><br />I need some Douglas Adams to cheer me up.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Excellent series.  I have recommended this series to many, many people.  It is clean, beautiful scenery from Downton Abbey to outside.  Beautiful.
1451629184|4.0|This little girl....wow!  Then to write about it.  I'm so proud of this girl for what she went through and survived to tell her story.  Very inspiring.
B00BLGZDVS|2.0|Not a very good story line and odd ending.  I was told it was about Scientology but the movie was not really about that.
B003SHUMRI|5.0|The movie is really good if you are a Channing Tatum fan.  This boy is one talented dancer and actor!  Who would have thought?  The first movie I saw with him was &#34;Dear John&#34; and from there I had to see other movies he was in.  He can really go from serious to very comical!  This movie was great!
B008Y73940|5.0|I love this movie.  When I cannot think of anything to watch I normally watch this.  Great story and surprising.
B0091WUZJE|5.0|One of, if not the best John Wayne movies! Great cast. Even though the Duke has been gone for many years, he is still the &#34;King of the Cowboys.&#34;
B009Z59ZNE|5.0|Ian Richardson is marvellous as the conniving Francis Urquhart.  All members of the cast of the three series were wonderfully watchable, but Ian Richardson was absolutely wonderful.
B00BP4WAZS|3.0|Let me get this out of the way: I LIKED this movie. I just wish I LOVED this movie.<br /><br />I know it's a lot to expect a kids movie to work on a level that adults can enjoy, but it's not asking the world these days. So much stuff does that juggling act well, but not Wreck it Ralph.<br /><br />I don't think that, in the case of this movie, it's an unreasonable request for this movie to appeal to adults. After all, even the most recent licensed video game property is probably at least 20 years old. The majority of kids in the target demo of this movie have no idea who/what QBert is, for example. Even the Street Fighter 2 characters will probably go over most of these kids heads. Because of this, it's sad that they didn't do more with them. If those licensed characters were put in there for the benefit of anyone over 30, then it was only to say &#34;hey, remember this character? Well, that's it!&#34;<br /><br />Like I said at the top, I want to make it clear that I like this movie a lot. It's very cute and imaginative, and I'm sure that kids will want to watch this over and over again. But there-in lies the problem. When the kids want to watch the movie on repeat, the parents need something to hold on to. Sadly this movie lacks those really good bits that will keep the parents happy on that 6th viewing and on.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|My husband and I read this  book simultaneously and it has  made a huge difference in our marriage.  definitely a good book whether happily married,  unhappily married,  or  single.
B0083EY9EI|5.0|I really can't say anything other than GET THIS CD. It's actually one of the best albums I've bought in a long time.
B002RKSZS0|3.0|story line just seemed too &#34;typical&#34; of Jane Austen, like this is the book she practiced with before she wrote Pride and Prejudice.  the ending seemed very rushed, loose ends tied up too quickly, and not believable enough for me.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I was immediately sucked into the lives of Follett's characters, who take us on a tour of the major historical events of the first quarter of the 20th century, including the Russian Revolution and World War I. I carried this around with me on my Kindle all day, dipping into it at every opportunity.
B002R5LKOQ|5.0|She had a voice, she will be missed. Perfect movie for her. Good casting for her first movie. We enjoyed it for the second time and we bought a copy.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I couldn't wait to pick this up as soon as I had finished Fall of Giants, and I can't wait for the next volume. A personal and up-close view of the rise of Nazism in Germany of the mid-30s, the Spanish Civil War, World War II, and the start of the Cold War. The reader should start with Fall of Giants, if possible, to fully appreciate the lives and background of the characters, from Russia, Germany, France, England, Wales and the U.S., whose lives constantly intersect. A 20th century version of The Pillars of the Earth.
B009HXG9UQ|5.0|It took me a little while and a few viewings to really appreciate this movie, but as an avid Wes Anderson fan, I knew I would love it before I even saw it.  As all of his movies, this one is beautifully shot and loaded with great characters.  And at its heart, it is about young love and adventure.  It might not be your favorite, but I think everyone can at least appreciate it.
B005MMYCY6|4.0|This movie held my attention. It was very different in it's storyline and the actors were wonderful.  Would definitely recommend it!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is an incredible book! It is a reading must! I loved every bit of it and want more! don't pass this up!
B007JMW46U|5.0|Sherlock Holmes is the ideal for later sleuths. The writing is clear and interesting with no waste--another ideal. Logic is a lost art, and these stories illustrate critical thinking in an easy-to- swallow form. It is hard to go wrong by reading this book or by using it with students.
B006HL9G10|3.0|does what it says. thanks.<br />more words, huh? ok... 30 Rock rules! even though all we have now is re-runs.
B009ERK1T0|1.0|Deftones are incredibly over rated and they suck. Theres not a lot of albums that have come out recently that is good but anything could be better than this.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I picked up one of the Jack Reacher books in an airport... and liked it so much, I looked for the series.  I am so glad that there are so many of them, because I really like Lee Child's work.  It's always nice to find a new author!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I love this on my Kindle Fire HD but it does lack a few important features compared to my cellphone app. 1. You can't share to a person's timeline or a group 2. You can't download a picture onto the device like you can on the PC 3. You can't hit HIDE like you can on PC. Another difference I noticed also between Kindle &amp; Android (cellphone) is I CAN share a post to a TImeline and/or Group. It would be great if they could add these features to the Kindle, then it would be almost perfect! If it had these features also I would have given it 5 stars for sure!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows. Just words to fill this review so that I am allowed to submit the form.
B00BHU9DUK|4.0|The stage-llike scenery was a bit confusing at first, then entertaining. Acting was impeccable. Dispute knowing the story line I was fully entertained. One can't go wrong with Keira Knightly. Jude Law did a wonderful job as the beleaguered husband.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|GAME IS great and habit forming. Too bad we can,t get more coins quicker when we run out. INSTEAD of 1 coin ever 60 sec, 5 would be better to keep game going  instead of one at a time.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Very addictive.  Started playing and could not put it down.  My wife thought I lost my mind until she started playing.  Now she can't put it down.
1400032717|4.0|The book while used, was in good condition, but the story line was not what I would normally read.  I was a book club selection I and  if I wasn't required  to discuss it, I wouldn't have finished it.  I did give me some insight to how the autistic mind thinks.
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|beautiful album.  very creative music, all songs different - isn't the same stuff x 20 tracks, all very unique. get it!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This is a well made film and it is clear why it won the awards that it did.  It was hard to look away.  Make sure you continue watching after the film is actually over because there are picture comparisons shown that are quite interesting.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|Very addicting I love it but the adds are annoying and now I can't get it to open otherwise It would be 5 stars.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Fast paced, well acted, good story line with attention to details of the actual events.  I will watch it again, which I don't do often
B00119ZMKW|5.0|Just watch it! You will definitely be glad you did. The col. O'neill character is especially funny this season. Enjoy!

B000VBJEEG|5.0|What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said?<br /><br />CONS: It isn't really about ratatouille and they never give you the recipe for it. It has a rat as the main character.<br />PROS: There are too many to list! It is still a bit slow start for my 4 year old (but he's used to the action packed Transformers and Tom & Jerry... so I wouldn't include his taste as either a positive or negative) but papa and I put this in for a good belly laugh. I love this movie and am excited that we finally added it to our collection.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Luv this app!! It is a way better app than temple run I totally give it a 5 star rating!! 👍😃

B00127RAJY|5.0|I lost weight, lost inches and feel so much stronger after doing this DVD. It was my first from Jillian. I have since bought Ripped in 30 which I interchange month to month with this. Love them both and continue to lose weight and inches and feel strong!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Since I have not used the calculator that much my review is not based on a good deal of use but I have had no problems or complaint. My rating of 5 is my feeling that nothing could be more perfect for a basic calculator.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|My daughter and I play this game all the time.. we both enjoy it and enjoy trying to complete the task!  my only frustrations are the community area always has a hard time connecting and its hard when we accidentally hit a button where it takes away our gems, I just wish it asked for a conformation..
B007VUA7VO|5.0|i love this app.it helps me alot. it lets me know when i need to charge it. cause i be on my kindle fire for hours.
B009M4KTEM|5.0|Really fun show to listen to, brought back memories of seeing Jerry around that time. I would highly recommend this set.
B00BESIKWM|1.0|Don't waste your time on this, because it's a couple hours of your life you won't ever get back. Rediculous plot that made absolutely no sense.
0684135051|4.0|I literally opened this book right as I pulled it out of the mailbox, and have had a difficult time putting it down since. I love her humor! And I already feel better about my knitting. I've always felt that there were things I do &#34;wrong&#34; or that I'm not a very skilled knitter. Those things may still be true, but what this book has already taught me is the most important thing - if I love knitting and it makes me happy, then I am doing it right.
B000HZGNEU|5.0|The best of the first six, in my opinion. *Spoiler alert in case you haven't seen this yet.* Enjoyed seeing the interaction of characters in, what was at the time, modern time. And comical as Chekov tries to find a &#34;nuclear wessel&#34; ;D
B007J4T2G8|5.0|can't wait to see if love wins out over sex .  Not my normal read but interesting and has a funny side.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This was an excellent book.  My wife bought it for me, knowing it would have to be good for me to read it.  I am not a reader, but enjoy war stories.  This one was exceptionally good.  It kept my interest throughout.
B00AYHKIZ6|3.0|Having listened to and enjoyed Bowie from a very early age (I have vague recollections of HUNKY DORY's release) I am partial to his seventies output excepting YOUNG AMERICANS and HEROES. I also regard everything between SCARY MONSTERS and TIN MACHINE as substandard. That is the perspective from which I write.<br /><br />This one I find neither very good nor objectionable in any significant way. It's simply OK. My main concern, though, is the sameness of mood and delivery throughout (however pleasant the individual songs may be). NEXT DAY sounds sterile instrumentally - like a group of talented session musicians playing perfectly but without any personal connection to the music. There's no Ronson or Eno-like imprint on any of these tracks. No memorable riffs, solos refrains, etc. Even Bowie's sax of yore, which I wasn't necessarily fond of, could leave a lasting impression. So there is very little that clings to my memory when this CD concludes. I believe both REALITY and HEATHEN contained superior songs and melodies but are also very similar to NEXT DAY from a performance aspect.<br /><br />And the cover art? Laziness and lack of creativity masquerading as profundity. Don't read too much into the cover. This is not HEROES' sequel. Or maybe it is but since I never really dug that one I don't hear it.<br /><br />Favorite tracks 'Dirty Boys' and 'Valentines Day.'<br /><br />The end.
B0012FHGCW|5.0|This is an excellent film, the cinematography is beautiful, the story-telling compelling, and it is based on an equally excellent book. Emile Hirsch is pitch perfect as young Christopher McCandless, a suburban kid who thinks he can go \\"into the wild\\" and make it his own.  Hirsch's acting is reserved but nuanced. His gestures are spare but speak volumes.  And then there's the scenery.  From the Sea of Cortez to the Grand Canyon to the Denali wilderness, it's breathtaking.  This is a movie that engrosses you from start to finish.<br /><br />But lordy, that Mccandless kid was a sorry piece of work. The film does not portray the boy as a hero, but neither does it delve into the selfishness of this naive young man. Many reviewers find much to admire about him him as a free spirit and 'idealist.'  Idealist my big toe.<br /><br />What is idealistic about willful ignorance and a sense of entitlement? The kid goes into one of the most challenging and threatening environments on the planet without having clue one about what he's getting into, without adequate supplies and without a map.  Idealism is best saved for politics and philosophy. In the wild, you need a willingness to learn. McCandless was so used to his family providing a safety net, it never occured to him that Nature would not bow to his needs as well. The movie, by the way, does hint that his parents are bad people because they offer the boy a new car when he graduates from high school and had the foresight to start a college fund for him.  We should all suffer such abuse.<br /><br />Chris McCandless certainly wanted people to think he was a selfless idealist, with his grandious handing over of his parent's money...not a cent of which he earned himself...to Oxfam. Plenty more where that came from, eh.  He also doesn't waste time and effort learning how to survive. \\"Living off the land\\" has such a nice ring to it...why lumber yourself with any useful information on how it is to be accomplished.  Naturally he becomes hopelessly lost. Naturally, after slaughtering a moose out of season, he eats a few bites and leaves the rest to rot. He doesn't even try to preserve it. What's so hard about slicing the meat thin and hanging it where the breeze hits it? It might not have worked, but he could have tried. His obliviousness is almost laughable: when he stumbles across an abandoned bus, which becomes his living quarters, he fails to connect the dots. Hello, it's a bus. Somebody drove it there, so there must be a road, probably right under the tires.  Probably the same road the bus driver used to to get out of the wilderness.<br /><br />Chris is no respecter of the wild, he's just lazy. Killing animals out of season impacts the species. So what. He was hungry. Even before getting to Alaska, he shows a woeful disrespect for nature; his trespassing in the Grand Canyon makes it clear he places far more importance on having fun than on preserving a wilderness.<br />No, I don't think McCandless was an idealist. He was certainy tragic: a tragic example of a middle class, pampered child.<br /><br />Thoreau was an idealist and he didn't just wander blindly into the woods. He had some survival skills and certainly was wiling to learn more. Had he and the McCandless lad met, I would like to think that Henry David might have made an exception to his usual peace-loving ways.  I can picture him placing one sensible and well-worn boot on the kid's backside and propelling him back toward his natural habitat...the nearest McDonalds.es hopelessly lost.

B001BKVWYG|5.0|A wonderful case that is very interesting and colorful which resemble the artist that is performing the music on the CD.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I love having the chance to read a book by &#34;Richard Castle&#34; anytime I want. Makes the show more enjoyable.
B00B2QA9TI|5.0|The only criticism I have of this movie is that it is entirely too long. It could have been made shorter without losing the effect it has on the viewer. It's a beautiful movie through and through. I loved how the scenes incorporated a stage production that would change back into a regular filmed movie. It gave the movie an extra effect that is not seen normally. Keira Knightly did a wonderful job, as always. Before watching, the viewer should be aware that the movie is different from what we normally subject ourselves to and absorb the movie with a fresh view.
B001XUJMZK|4.0|Good movie. The graphic violence got to me after a bit. Battle scenes are meant to be violent and graphic, I just tired of them.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|This app is a lot of fun, very enjoyable , Fun in doctor office ect. I am very glad I decided to download this .
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Politically, The West Wing (1999-2006) came along at the right time for me. Watching this show helped me make it through the GW Bush first term in the White House and half-way through his last term. It depicted a fictional snapshot of the inner workings of Washington DC, and it gave hope to legions of young Americans who believed that this country could work for everyone. With President Bartlett in the Oval Office, we had a leader who was anti-Bush in every respect, and a voice for Change. Between The West Wing and another popular show, 24, which depicted a black POTUS, the electorate was being primed for a 2008 Presidential election that would change the world as we knew it. TWW was one of my favorite dramatic TV series - second only to Columbo.
B00881VLCE|1.0|I was easy to download, very cool puzzle choices. Once I started a puzzle everything was going great until i had to exit out.  The puzzle will not even turn on now .
1419553429|5.0|The book was very helpful. It pointed out a lot of tips from the answers (correct & incorrect) ones. However, the materials were very limited.
B0076DELIG|3.0|It held my attention doing my slow readind plus having been gone for a couple of weeks.  Finished reading when I returned .  J.A.Trigg
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Very inspirational, Christian themed movie!  Everyone should watch this and learn a valuable lesson!  I bought two; one for me and one for my son and his family. Life changing!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I could not put this book down (on my kindle).  I would set my kindle to read to me on my way to and from work.  I wish there was a fourth book!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Its about time somebody stepped outside the box and made a totally novel game.  Money well spent for many hours worth of strategic play, trying to wipe out the human race once and for all.  What fun!!!  You have the option of spending more money to unlock stuff, but no extra money need be spent at all, everything is unlockable through game play.  I wish more developers kept to this ethic.  I am very excited to see updates and what else this developer may have down the line, this being a homerun at their first time up to bat.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I really liked it but come on.... Who has sex 3-4 times a day!! Book one is the best. I like that in Book 2 & 3 they have a little drama that isn't sex related.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I enjoyed all the movies, and games. i like reading all the great books kindle has instore, The children games all the kids enjoed, u am finding so much us for kindle
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My granddaughter whom I ordered the movie said she would give it 14 stars if she could, guess it must have been great!
B001TM14VC|4.0|Great movie, Lots of amazing actors in it including Tom Cruise, Val Kilmer, Kelly McGillis and Meg Ryan to name a few.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I know Amazon asks you to write a review about every book you finish reading but this one I feel compelled to because I enjoyed it so much. I would definitely recommend this book to others. You really feel part of the narrator's world and sometimes just want to reach out and give him a hug yourself.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I could not put this book down. I found myself up late into the night compromising that I would only read one more chapter, but with each passing chapter I wanted to read more! A fascinating story well ensconced in Greek Mythology, I find myself praying to Zeus that it's a true story and all the Gods are real! Rich character development and a strong plot drive this book and I would strongly recommend a good read to readers of ANY age.
B001LM1456|5.0|I bought this movie for my great nephew for his 5th birthday. He was so excited when he opened it.
B003D0ZNM4|5.0|I am not a musician.  I will put that out first.  I thought I was fairly well versed in classical music, but the music of this artist is something I have just recently come across.  No, I disagree completely with those who put Part in the mix with Philip Glass.  This is the music of THE great modern composer.  Why he is not the most acclaimed musician of our time escapes me.  I think this creative, breathtaking artist is the late 20th century Beethoven.  Frankly, I think he is the greatest composer since Stravinsky.  He has breadth.  His religious music is \\"Holy.\\"  His secular music is enthralling.  It touches the zeitgeist of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.  It is the greatest advance we have seen since the atonal modern movement.  I know I sound like an insane man, but I cannot believe this music has not demanded the attention of our age!
B0095P31L6|5.0|My grand kids loved this movie. We have watched it 7 times in two days.Grand kids would still be watching this move if they could.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a fun card game that kills time while in a doctor's, dentist's or anyother waiting room.  I would recommend it to anyone.  I didn't have any problems loading it or it's performance.<br />  Now, to kill space so amazon will let me submit this review and get out of here.  How much can you say about an old card game anyway?  This game was on my first computer that I got in the early 1990's.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I had heard about this show from a couple people and everyone who told me about just adored this show. Great acting, great scenery, and the story is fictional but completely genius! One of my all time favorites by far.
B009GQ57ES|4.0|I bought this album because I really like the song \\"Thrift Shop\\" and for the sale price of $4, I figured there wasn't anything to loose. As it turns out, the album is really solid. All the songs are good, with \\"Thrift Shop\\" and \\"Gold\\" being the most fun, and \\"Same Love\\", \\"A Wake\\", and \\"Starting Over\\" being the most affecting. Macklemore is a rare kind of artist, one that can write and perform tracks that are alternately fun and serious, but always honest and enjoyable. Ryan Lewis' production is more on the pop side of hip-hop production (which normally isn't my thing) but it compliments Macklemore's rap style. If this album is still $4 when you're reading this, definitely pick it up. Even if it's back to full price, it's well worth the money. Definitely one of the two best albums I've bought this year, the other being \\"This Generation\\" by MURS and Fashawn.
B002U0KHMY|4.0|Really like this TV show - like cheeky Neal - missed some of season one so was nice to be able to see the entire season
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book has been a wonderful escape for me during these trying times of mine...I've thoroughly enjoyed reading this book as well as the two preceding...
B009T3AE1Y|4.0|I really enjoy Robert Pattinson's acting - I have seen all his movies - this one is a little strange but still good - very different for him.  Nice to see him challenged.
B008Y1YJZY|3.0|It is quite okay entertainment although the storyline is a bit thick and also boring in between. Of course the animation is very good and in 3D very realistic
B0083H6AQA|5.0|This movie follows the book and brings the character to life.  It is a good movie and I enjoyed very much.
1616550414|5.0|The book was in great condition. The contents served its purpose well stating every detail of The Legend of Zelda. I've played most of the loz games and learned ALOT in this historia. Not to mention there is a manga in the back of the book which is amazing! The manga gives you a surprise that will tell you exactly how Skypiea came to existence and how the whole reincarnation of Link and Hylia (Zelda) started. This book is a must get for every loz fan!
B002BWP49C|5.0|Stayed true to the book - all the Twilight movies are good - really nice to see the wedding - loved Bella's dress - enjoyed the movie very much
B0083Z614S|5.0|This book is really captivating.  It kept me reading.  All the chapters flowed together really well. This author is great!!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This is a great album - I like Adele's voice - it is unique and her songs are great .
B004SIIBGU|2.0|Haven't been able to use it yet.  I have tried but it keeps asking for my user name and password and won't let me go any further.
B001ED7C58|5.0|This is a good soundtrack - did not know until I got it that Robert Pattinson sings two songs  on the sound track.
B006BXTOFC|4.0|I enjoyed this CD and thought the music had a few great songs on it such as &#34;Lonely Boy&#34; and &#34;Gold on the Ceiling.&#34; the rest of the songs were pretty good as well and it puts me in a great mood when I listen driving to work.
B0012EM5D8|4.0|Really cute story but can get a little slow at times.  We have a 4 year old boy and he likes the movie, but loses interest about half way through.  I like it because it's a good, clean family movie.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|I would recommend this game to anyone who is in the mood for a nice relaxing yet challenging game. it's. great!  also the music is wonderful!
B0030N3O8Y|4.0|Although still like to watch Seanson 8, the stories are not so attractive as the earlier Seasons. So, only 4 stars.
0764141201|5.0|Thank you very much for the quick delivery and I enjoyed the book.  It was much more than what I expected, very good book to work with my Japanese students.
B008XG1X18|4.0|The app for my android works perfectly. However, the app on my kindle doesn't. There are constantly problems that forces it to shut down. Other than that the app is amazing. I love trying new crafts and food.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I thought the acting was superb and even though I was very familiar with the storyline being old enough to remember the events it kept me on the edge of my seat.  Highly recommended
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app works out GREAT for myself as well as my 3<br />kids for their homework!<br /><br />And the best thing is, it's free!!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This is a great game with a massive amount of levels.  You also have the option of playing two different versions.  Addicting to the point of exhaustion.. but you keep on playing because it is so challenging.
1594487154|5.0|This book could not be more timely. In an age where young tech geeks and content producers &#34;hack&#34; search algorithms to dupe people into buying things they don't need (and sometimes don't want), the world needs to believe there are genuine people out there.<br /><br />Dan Pink delivers in providing great examples and scientific proof that looking to provide value to people is profitable. Then are likely hundreds of books which teach &#34;give first, ask later&#34;. Pink takes it one step further by giving an idea how to truly do it without being smarmy.<br /><br />As someone who has never take a class to learn how to sell, I subscribe to this book in a Biblical way. Every sale I have ever done has come from the need to provide real value to people. More people should consider doing this. Instead of focusing on quotas, focus on delivering happiness or help. If it's not there, you have time to find where you can deliver it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great show. Not sure about the historical accuracy, but this group of actors is incredibly talented and play off each other very well. Would highly recommend it!
B00B49L7Y4|4.0|Searching for Sugar Man is a story which deserved to be told. It is truly a remarkable wonder Rodriguez discovered his legendary status in South Africa.<br /><br />As someone who loves the story behind great musicians and labels, I really wish they would have dug deeper into Rodriguez's business affairs. Seriously, who swallowed his royalties? How in the 21st century can that not be tracked? I call foul.<br /><br />Also, it seems the filmmaker wanted to maintain some of the mysticism to Sixto Rodriguez. That's fine by me, but I wonder if other viewers wanted to know more.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great show. Not sure about the historical accuracy, but this group of actors is incredibly talented and play off each other very well. Would highly recommend it!

B00AA0TZTW|5.0|This is the clearest and simplest recording with none of the over processing. One can hear why he is a signature guitarist, and possibly one of the best of all time. If you like guitar and love Hendrix get this CD.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|I was'nt crazy about the title although i get why it was chosen,but the book its self was a great story.I was surprised how much the book dealt with the german pilot so much more than the american,but by the end of the book i was hoping he and the few pilots that were mentioned would survive to the end of the war.Nice perspective from the the german side considering that they flew so much more and didnt have the manpower to rotate for breaks that the U.S.pilots could.<br />The pivotal monent is here and gone in a few pages but as you read on you realize the risks he took to help the bomber crew ,and the story flows so well it holds your interest till the end.And the end makes it all worthwhile,no enemies anymore just two elderly guys who did what they could for their countries.

B000LTAY1U|5.0|I bought this watch to wear when I'm not at work. It's a very basic and casual watch but it gets the job done and is a quality piece. If you are going to buy this watch just make sure you are going to wear it a lot because if it sits for a extended period of time you will have to wind it to the correct time. However, not having to replace a battery is always a nice feature. Try and get it when it is on sale (I got mine for $55 w/ Prime shipping and it came a day early). Make sure you read the instructors so the watch works correctly. It is water resistant but not water proof so going into a lake or the ocean is a no-go with this watch while getting water on it while washing your hands or when it rains is not an issue.<br /><br />While I haven't had any negatives experiences with this watch since I purchased it about a week ago, I do feel that the band might start to fray after a lot of use but that is something that I will talk about when I update this review in a month or so.<br /><br />Update 1: It's been almost 3 months since I purchased this item and I have no complaints. Everything is holding up perfectly. It keeps time perfectly and the band hasn't frayed as I expected it would. I consider this to be a great purchase if you're looking for a solid casual automatic watch.

If you want to feel great and improve your relationship with food, sleep better, and gain knowledge about what's in our food, this is for you.

B007XHWROK|1.0|I've heard that all of the youngsters nowadays listen to this Justin Beiber. I bought this album to study what today's youth like, and see if I could maybe incorporate some ideas into an album I'm working on.<br /><br />First off, there is not a single Country song on this entire album. It's nothing but devil music. I'm not even sure if I received the right album, because all of the songs I heard had some woman singing about her nether region. Disgusting.

As  I began the book and realized that Ana was a mere 22 I was convinced I wouldn't be able to relate to this much hyped about story and boy was I wrong. 25-35 or 55 read this profoundly erotic fantasy.
B000Y0Q5NM|4.0|Still excited to see more of the Asgard, the Acients, and the tech we get from these adventures.  Surprised they don't show more research into the tech they find.
0307346617|4.0|A global disaster happened on earth, human civilization is threatened. Humanities are filled with ignorance and panic. All countries around the world face a serious problem, they are all fighting for the same goal to save the last hope of humanities. In the book named World War Z, the author Max Brooks tells a story of zombie apocalypse through interviews of different people around the world after the war. The purpose of this book is to make the readers feel fear. It also wants to make the readers to think about how would people and different countries react to a global disaster. The theme of the book is people are ignorance of what is happening to them at first, when they find out the truth, they would do anything, including harming other people, to survive.<br /><br /> In the beginning of the book, an infection broke out in China, the infection soon spread west to the Middle East and to Africa. People who are infected turn into zombies. Governments of countries around the world, especially the United States, wanted to deny the existence of infection and zombies and let people be ignorant about what's going on. But, overtime, panic among people grew as the infection spread and zombies overturn cities. So, people decide to fight back. The government officials wanted to create safety zones and go in to total war with zombies, but the zombies don't need food, water, weapons, and other resources in the war like humans, so humans created new weapons to fight against the zombies.<br /><br />  The plot of this book is riveting, clever, and authentic because unlike other zombie books that just talk about how zombies destroy the world and people are trying to fight back, it tells stories by interviewing different people. It makes the book a lot more interesting because the readers can read from different perspectives and reactions of how people and countries dealing with zombies around the world. Also it doesn't just talk about zombies, it also talk about relationship between people and countries during the war. In one interview in the book, in Denver, Colorado, USA, a man named Todd Wainio was interviewed. He was in an army in Yonkers to fight against zombies. In his interview, he explained that, \\"You remember what it was like, people just freaking out... boarding up their houses, stealing food, guns, shooting everything that moved. They probably killed more people... than Zack.\\" He said that what makes zombies hard to fight is fear. Zombies don't feel fear, but humans do. Also, according to an interview with a director of South Korean Central Intelligence Agency, he explained that South Korea was under a lot of pressure during the war because half of its military force was used for protection in case of North Korea invasion. He also realizes that North Korean spies, soldiers, and major population disappeared. He believed that they were hiding underground, he was worried that there were weapons under North Korea. It shows what might happen to the relationship between North and South Korea during a war related to the real world.<br /><br /> The characters in this book are not complex because this book focuses more on the plot than the characters. There is no detail description of every interviewee in the book. However, the main character in the book, the zombies, are relatable to the real world. Zombies don't have their own thoughts, they only act on animal instincts to destroy humanities. Zombies are related to people in real life who just follow other people's directions without further thinking. Soldiers are good examples, they just follow the order from their commander to fight and kill people they don't know and take over other people's land. They act just like the zombies. Also, similar to zombie infections, when soldiers attack a country and injured a lot of people, then people in that country would be very angry and want to be soldiers to fight back. However, zombies in this book are not unique because the author describes them similar to other zombie books.<br /><br /> The prose in this book is somewhat interesting. There are a lot of dialogues in the book because the book is all written by interviews. In some interviews, the author just tells the story without using figurative language and descriptive imagery, which makes the story boring. However, the author uses figurative language or descriptive imagery in some interviews, readers can visualize the scene in their minds. The author uses simile to describe a patient who was infected. \\"He was like an animal; a gag muffled his growls.\\" Readers can really feel how terrible the infection is through his writing. Also, in another interview of a man fighting against zombies face to face, the author wrote, \\"Aiden jumped up and ran behind me...Tim looked frantically around the room for a weapon just as it grabbed him by the shirt. They fell on the carpet, wrestling. He shouted for us to get in the bedroom, for me to get the gun.\\" The author uses descriptive imagery to paint a picture of the fighting scene in readers' minds.<br /><br /> Overall, the author met his purpose of his tone and theme. The book makes people think about how the world would be like in a global disaster. The weaknesses of this book are the characters and the prose. I would give this book 4 stars and recommend other people to read it.
B00499QUK2|5.0|The servies is very well written and acted.  I especially like the fact that close captioning is now available.  Definitely worth watching.
1616550414|5.0|If you're a Zelda fan, this is the perfect book for you. It can also make a really nice coffee table book.
B009AMANBA|4.0|From the reviews here, I'm looking forward to it.  I've been a Civil War buff since age 9 and a Civil War living historian (now portraying the 72nd PA of the Union Army of the Potomac) since 1988.  I really appreciate Mr. Bruno's review.  The war WAS truly about slavery no matter what the \\"politically correct\\" crowd tries to talk everybody into.  I've heard a black fella say at work and documentation from especially black people in Hellywood like Bill Cosby that Lincoln was an idiot and other less dignifying comments but he (Lincoln) was the emancipator of the slaves.  He wasn't a god but an imperfect person like myself and everybody else that lived other than the God-man Jesus Christ.  Lincoln wanting the freed black men to colonize outside of the US was not from hatred for them and belittlement but understanding what would happen post-war that actually did, ie, the KKK and other acts of the kind.  He wasn't a \\"dumb farmer\\" like most liberals think that he was but one of the most intelligent men that ever lived equal to George Washington.  Lincoln gave his very life for the cause of emancipation of the slave.  From Booth's own diary notes that he (Booth) was a racist.  If you're NOT for Lincoln, that you must be for Booth.  Even most southerners mourned Lincoln's death knowing what the Reconstruction would be with him dead...which again DID happen.  There are so many unbiased books to buy or take out of the library on Lincoln and his positions politically but most people are too lazy to read but listen to garbage instead.  I only gave it 4 stars since I didn't see it to actually give it my own opinion.
B00BQUUH7E|5.0|really love this game! probably the best mixture of sport and arcade. reminde me of an old school hockey game Hat Trick.<br /> and bike baron is cool)
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A very interesting read, when you are reading it is hard to stop. He express his feelings and his wifes feelings very well.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|I really enjoyed this film. Joseph Gordon Levitt is an excellent actor and this film really showcases his talent. Time travel, Bruce Willis, what more can u ask for.
B004SDSSFY|2.0|I purchased the Key but it did not allow Main App use it. Not sure if problem is Amazon or Tablet. In any case program does not work yet.
B00BESLHEA|1.0|When this movie was announced I couldn't wait for it to come out. Little did i know it was a giant waste of film. Throwaway characters bad dialogue boring story! The cast is pretty awesome but it seemed as if they didn't care about the movie either.
B004SDEP38|3.0|I am unable to use it on my Android Tablet. Will open but cannot test it and modify documentts or start a new document or spread sheet.
B001KDQ4KQ|1.0|I never got the book on my kindle, as I paid for it and I have informed amazon many times but did not get an answer.<br /><br />Please, please download this on my kindle.
B0073LWEXK|3.0|I just don't understand why such an attractive and potentially-fun game has to be marred by so many obscure clues that force you to cheat. I'd like to figure it out on my own but keep getting stuck. I think with more effort, they could've provided hints that at least lead you in the right direction. Being frustrated is simply not fun.
B00AEFXXMI|5.0|Have not watched the movie yet, I gave it as a gift.  Haven't gotten any complaints so I'm thinking it was fine.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This was a really fun read!  I really like how the book is layed out, along with the fantastic writing style of Mr Brooks.  I really hope that something like the story never actually occurs.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I couldn't put it down - writing is superb - I am a city girl - not country - not farm - not hiking - not outdoorsy - this book is one of the best I've ever read!
B009NSHZLW|3.0|I like it but I still have formate the video's'to mp4 and then when I play them it's really hard to fastforward or rewind. I wish it was a little easer to naigate.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|My 3 year old son loves Mario and when he found this for his ipod he loved it. Now, he has stole mine and his daddys Kindles too to play on.
B0095P3ULC|3.0|It's transformers...if you like the Transformers series, you'll like this ok.  It's not the best of the 4 and it's nothing extraordinary in general but it's watchable.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|Didn't like the movie  thaught it was kind of a wast of money.<br />Wouldn't recomend it for anyone not a kid movie
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Ok. I just want a teddy bear like that. It was a great Friday night movie. Go Ted! Hahaha hahaha
B003EVWDR0|5.0|Best 3D movie in my colection of 3D movies<br />Love it has lots of great action and love the story line
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Great music. Great acting. Great story. Funny. Movies are just becoming so predictable now a days. But it was a good movie
B008NW1M4K|5.0|Während wir oft über geschichtliche Ereignisse nachdenken, denkt hier ein geschichtliches Ereignis über uns nach. Ein wirklich genialer Autor! Danke für das Buch!
B004FP1WX0|5.0|People are dumb. Why do they have to be fake. And why would you lead some one on like that
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Wow, the scenery, the action, the story (although a bit predictable) just the way the movie was filmed. Something that you can watch over and over again.<br />Similar to the Star Wars saga, can't wait for Avatar II
B0054SMIH6|5.0|I'm not sure of the actor's name who portrayed the man wrongfully prosecuted, convicted and ultimately put on death row for a crime committed by someone rich and powerful, but his performance was simply outstanding. From a desperate, poor man going through the legal system who can only think about what his conviction would do to his mom to a numb, cynical man was nothing short of brilliant. Matthew McConaughey also gives a wonderful performance, adding a depth to his character that some of his other roles have not demanded. Marissa Tormei was wonderful, as always, and a great supporting cast make this movie well worth watching. Maybe even more than once!
B0012HF5NC|4.0|A really fun escape movie, lots of action even though the outcome was a forgone conclusion.<br />It was just as good as Armageddon with Bruce Willis.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|If you like drama, sci-fi, and action, this is your show. It is one of the best TV shows I've watched. I highly recommend it. The story-line has a lot of different characters facing their own life issues while at the same time trying to survive and fight an enemy while being overpowered and outgunned.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Well worth the price. Hidden objects plus puzzles and good story. Played the demo version first and got hooked. Will buy more games from this developer.
B00BM1AJIO|4.0|The game was great. You go through different worlds and the graphics were great. The price was nice and low,$2.99.The only problem I had was the dinning room, when I got there I didn't know what to do but I found that the red cylinder I had needed to go in the hinge of the door (I hope that piece of info helps someone). The ONLY reason why I gave 4stars is because the ending was so abrupt that it seemed there was going to be a second part, to be continued, a mini game or something but no, just credits. I would definitely recommend anyone to play this game...AWESOME!!!! So, game writers please make a part 2 where the kid becomes possessed by the demon or something. Thank you.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Seeing this movie on TMC, it's become a favorite.  Ms Stanwyck has become one of my favorite actresses that I try to catch everthing she's done.  I found it interesting that she did her own stunts in westerns. Very rare.  It is an interesting movie, filled with great people doing great jobs.  It also shows why the pairing of Ms Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray is a natural.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Daniel Craig , has brought a new Bond to the series of actors which have played James Bond. Which by doing so he has earned himself a seat that i hope to see many more Bond movies with him at the reins!!!! Awsome movie!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is entertaining. The graphics are very good! My daughter loves to feed and wash the horse. Would recommend this game.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my daughter loves this game. she loves horses and this just makes her feel like she has one of her own.
B000003B6J|5.0|Every song on this album is great...so OG! a must have for any hiphop fan features,&#34;I ain't tha one&#34;, and &#34;Express yourself&#34; true classics

B000NI8F5G|5.0|Great classic movie! Fun to see these talented stars in their prime. I always wanted to be Debbie Reynolds when I was growing up.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|This is an excellent show and season. Witty dialogue, action, romance, crime solving... everything one needs from a show of this type.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Love Prime movies. Show has lots of action and keeps your attention.<br />Actors are good and want to know what happens next.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i love this game so much......it is the best game ever put into the world...i think that this game is addictive yes very much so but it is fun to play
B00BHMF578|4.0|Argo was a good movie, not sure if it was Best Picture worthy but...it was a tense and thrilling ending
B008G59IBI|5.0|5*!! Excellent cd, very interesting, specially for the fans, really great. I recommend it for everyone to listen this cd.
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|This was my first time reading  Susan Kiernan-Lewis and it will not be the last time.  She keeps you guessing up to the end of the story as to who the murderer is or could there be more the one<br />murderer - why are they happening and who will be next.... I am looking forward to going on Maggie Newberry's next mystery adventure.
B0082LUEW8|5.0|5*!! Excellent cd, very interesting, specially for the fans, really great. I recommend it for everyone to listen this cd.
0375869026|5.0|I had put this book in my wish list and told one daughter about it as I thought it sounded interesting.  She told me that she had already ordered it herself, so after she powered through it in no time, she handed it over for me to read.  Awesome is all I can say.  I just couldn't put it down.  I have worked with middle school age kids for years and this year I am working with those that are in 5th grade (like the story).  It just felt really real.  This is a hard age for so many to go through and I can just see how this book is going to become extremely popular for that group of kids.  Not only that age, BUT EVERY AGE, will fall in love with the characters and the story.  You can really see growth in most individuals as the story progresses.  I love how parts of the book are written from the different characters perspectives and why they do and say the things they do.  Will now pass this on to another daughter as she reads novels to her kids each night after dinner.  This is one they will enjoy.
B008YZXYY2|5.0|5*!! Excellent cd, very interesting, specially for the fans, really great. I recommend it for everyone to listen this cd.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Consistently keeps you guessing with twists such that you are never quite sure that the baddies really are bad, and the goodies might just be the baddies anyway........ The parallel relationships within the main cast keep a delicious tension going too....
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|We all loved this movie. Good for me and my kids both. I Highly recommend it to you as well.
B002UNMW7O|5.0|After three years and a bunch negative feedback, I finally got around to watching the sequel to my all-time favorite movie. Took me long enough because I feared that it would ruin the first one for me --- much like \\"The Hangover II\\" did for \\"The Hangover\\" for me. But I finally decided to form my own opinion.<br /><br />The first 30 minutes thru it I was sighing, feeling that that is exactly what it would be --- another crappy sequel milking the same buck twice. We got a sexy, southern belle to replace the coolest gay guy ever(I've noticed that only severe homophobes hate the original lol)and a new Mexican Comic-relief named Romeo to replace the original Italian Rocco. Rocco, Romeo, Ro--o ----- sigh ....<br /><br />Then it takes a twist at around minute 31!<br /><br />In my opinion, Troy Duffy set out to make his sequel SEEM predictable at first to keep it unpredictable!<br /><br />If you love \\"The Boondocks Saints\\" as much as I, then you MUST watch the follow-up (I feel \\"follow-up\\" is a more apropriate word then just \\"sequel\\"). This movie was exactly what I expected it to be three years ago --- not better than the original but still a great movie ---- And I was pleasantly surprised to find it far better than I had heard!<br /><br />I have to truly wonder if all the haters actually watched the movie from beginning to end???<br /><br />Here's an excerpt of one of the best quotes I've ever heard in ANY movie ---- and it's from Boondock Saints 2!: \\"Real men hide their feelings. Why? BECAUSE IT'S NONE OF YOUR F-----G BUSINESS!! Men do not cry, men do not pout, men jack you in the f-----g jaw and say ... 'Thanks for coming out!'\\"<br /><br />Go watch the movie already!
B003VANOFY|5.0|I wish i could rate these higher then you can on here, best gaming headset i ever owned and believe me i owned alot of different ones ever the very pricey ones. I love Logitech products, they never seem to disappoint me.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|What is there to say about this movie? For me, a great movie is one you can watch over and over again. The cast is terrific! I was always a big Jeff Bridges fan and he is incredibly believable as the Dude. John Goodman and Steve \\"Shut up Donnie\\" Buscemi are great, and there is a terrific spot of John Tuturro as Jesus that is simply hysterical!<br />The DVD quality is excellent.
B005NK69ZC|4.0|Really enjoying this book. It's truly Ellen. Written just like she talks on her show, with lots of funny parts.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I am sure most &#34;Walking Dead&#34; junkies feel the same this season. So much setup for the finale! Could we kill a few more zombies already and somebody accidentally or on purpose kill Andrea? Her distorted view of &#34;Utopia&#34;is killing me. And Rick, get it together man, or there is going to be a hostile takeover, probably by your own groupies. Love Love Hate Hate Hate the governor! Who doesn't? He's probably Kirkman's most brilliant character so far. Average Joe from anywhere, loves his family, hates his job, has tragic life events and then gets thrown into an apocalyptic world and gets his comeuppance. Who can't relate to this guy? Head Check! The apocalypse has fried this guys brain! Which way will resident nerd Milton go. He seems a bit tired of doing the governor's dirty work. I know Robert Kirkman has got some awesome stuff up his sleeve so I am holding out for the end of the season. &#34;Walking Dead&#34;, still my favorite escape from reality!
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|Much different than I expected. Read it to my children with great delight. Looking forward to the rest of the series
B009AMANBA|5.0|A great portrayal of out sixteenth president - the movie has some surprises that make it even more memorable - must see
B00993EY2O|5.0|This film is a documentary - like rundown of Tony Wilson and his years running the fantastic Factory Records out of Manchester, UK. From Joy Division through the Happy Mondays, New Order to the rise of Rave Culture, Tony was at the center of the storm. His genius, his ego, his foibles and downfall are all examined with an eye to unflinching detail. A great film.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|If you like adventure and speed, this is the app for you. With more surprises and challenges, its sure to win you over too. The graphics are excellent on the kindle fire and on android phones. Get points and power ups to advance to the next level for more treasures. You'll love it!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|though not a Stephen King fan generally, this book was interesting from the opening scene.  An excellent read which I have and would recommend.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|Little hard in the beginning in getting hooked on the book but once your hooked you can't put the book down.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I upgraded to the Anker mouse from a standard 5 button wheel mouse.  The feel is perfect for my hand size.  It glides and tracks perfectly on a SteelSeries QCK pad.  The software, which must be downloaded, is simple to setup and apply.  The lighting changes, however, only affect the Anker symbol on the palmrest.  The mouse is a bit light, so adding some of the included weights was definitely helpful.
B006RJTEIC|4.0|Kinda old school science fiction. You start to recognize all the science fiction references in other shows once you have seen this movie.
B008QCBFHG|5.0|I love all the voices on this recording.  There are some lucious arias, and my love of Handel grows each time I listen.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|I enjoyed watching this movie.  Good animation. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
B00BESFWBY|5.0|Not since the &#34;Endless Summer&#34; was released in the late 60's has a movie portrayed surfing in such a credible and realistic manner.  Most surf films are just clothing company produced hero worship for the latest and the greatest.  Most Hollywood attempts, for example &#34;In God's Hands&#34;, are aimed at wanna-bees in Iowa that have never even seen the ocean.  If watching &#34;Chasing Mavericks&#34; doesn't have your stomach roll up into your mouth when Jay paddles out to surf Mavericks you either are dead or dying.<br />Having been surfing for 50 years, I assure you the feeling Jay had upon successfully making the wave is not easily duplicated outside the arena of the ocean at its wildest. Sit back and enjoy the ride!
B0093ST02E|1.0|I had a hard time watching it all the way through. . . . . . . . . . .  It's reminiscence of director Sarah Polley's past works.  She likes to act in & direct off-beat movies, which is fine, but this one missed the mark for me.
B00BLGZDVS|1.0|I did not get it, end of story!  If it is supposed to be a knock on Scientology, the knock was on a screen door.
B00ANDPGJE|5.0|wonderfully well written and acted... this is a fascinating series.  due to the unique effect of having the main character from time to time speak directly to the camera, the viewer feels as if he has inside information as the plot develops.  and what a plot it is!  we follow the twists and turns created by the nefarious Prime Minister and his even more manipulative spouse with something akin to childlike wonder.  marvelous use of the English language...
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Start at the front with this. Or if you have already read some Reacher books this'll give you some personal history on the character.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|this is my favorite tv show. love the funny and scifi together. everyone should watch this show the best seasons are the first 4
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|This is a pretty solid remake of a classic action movie.  The writers kept enough of the original story and characters to justify the title, while adding new material and changes to keep it fresh and interesting.  The effects are first rate and a dramatic update over the original, as you'd expected, and between the three leads - Colin, Jessica and Kate - there's plenty of eye candy for everyone.  This movie is very much worth a rent, and while I can't quite rate it a &#34;must purchase&#34;, neither would it be a waste of money for those who did wish to purchase.  It's a movie I'd watch several times over.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Excellent movie, funny at times and irreverent, it shows that even with handicaps life could be lived fully. The actors are outstanding
B000NMW6M0|4.0|First, I have to say that watching this movie felt like I was watching a train wreck.  Compelling drama, as you watch tragedy unfolding, and have no idea where it's all going to end up.  The acting was superb, and the locations and cultures were intriguing.  It seemed so disparate at first, but as the film progressed, the pieces started coming together, wrapped up rather neatly at the end, and that's what made it very good.  I don't think it was a great movie, hence the four stars, but it was definitely a good movie.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I had subway surfers and bought double coins it said to download this app again in the app store so I deleted it and downloaded it again but all it did was delete every thing I had bought
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The writer always keeps your attention with a different turn of events. Never what I expected. reading the second book now.
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|Heartthrob is easily one of Tegan and Sara's most ambitious works, branching almost entirely into the electronic realm. Sainthood could be seen as a midpoint from which the duo leapt to reach their next musical apex, breaking into the pop music atmosphere more sharply than most already there while retaining personal integrity. In simple terms, another link in Tegan and Sara's immaculate evolutionary chain.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Another great book from Nicholas Sparks.  This author keeps you interested in his characters and in this case surprises you.  I can't wait to see the movie.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|my co worker turned me on to this game....and I absolutely love it!!! i love the graphics and the colors in the background, the challeging levels.<br />It truly is addictive, which isn't a good thing when you're playing it at work!!!! I can barely get any work done
0307960471|3.0|Could not put them down!  The framework of this one is different and not NEARLY as compelling. Could barely finish and was not satisfied.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I started using pinterest out of curiosity around 6 months ago. Now I go to it almost everyday looking for ideas for every project, from chrochet, recipes, art ed, etc. Love it, love it.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Great documentary. I can see why much of the information in the movie is not widely known.  It is amazing to gain some insight into the control very few food companies exert on our daily lives. It is also very unsettling. But, can the average person make a difference in their lives? I doubt it. It costs too much $$.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Watch your time when you start playing, it could just slip bye. Very addictive and colorful. Just like bejewled only better
B00AESN8XY|5.0|its a great game it gets challenging Wich makes it fun<br />also stop giving 1 star for &quot;too hard&quot; and &quot;not working&quot; they will fix it<br /><br />PS. I like potatoes
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I already recommed this book to other people,it is one of the books you don't want it to end .
B00BMVTS1S|4.0|Once again Peter Jackson proves that a good book can make a good movie without completely re-writing it. This is an excellent watch, but was a bit shorter than I expected one of his LOTR movies to be (only 2 hours and change).  Buy it, Watch It and Enjoy It! You won't be disappointed if you're a fan of the LOTR books.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I could not put this book down once I started reading it.  Having lost my father to early onset dementia, and simply not knowing what was going through his mind when he could no longer articulate his thoughts and feelings, I felt as though the author of this story provided some insight as to what the person suffering this disease may be thinking and feeling.  I have shared some of these experiences, wondering whether or not to submit to genetic testing for a disease for which there is no cure.  I would highly recommend this book.
0307272702|5.0|There is super helpful info for everyone in this book, but after reading it I would say it is a MUST for someone with 50 plus pounds to lose who may feel lost and really wants to learn about the basic categories of food and their role in weight loss. Good read for everyone though!
B00371QQ0M|5.0|Sting. The Wierding way. Jean Luc Picard. Gargantuan Worms. Tiny Witches. Duals. Floating Bad Guys. Sleepers Awakening. Water of Life.
B000SVZIDA|1.0|I ordered this for my mothers birthday and it came in the mail and it was a blue ray, not a normal DVD like I requested, so I was not ale to get her a gift for her bday
B0053O89KG|5.0|I was very late coming to the Castle Series, but thanks to a friend I have now found my favorite show!  Season 5 is pre-ordered!<br />Excellent writing, talented actors, dynamic character mix, and stirring music are but a few of the wonderful attributes of the show. It has been fun and satisfying to watch the characters develop over the four seasons with Beckett, Alexis, this mother, Ryan, and Espinoza.<br />I love watching the DVDs - no pauses, no commercials and I can watch my favorite stories or scenes over and over, again.<br />Nathan Fillion is an acting treasure and he is &#34;ruggedly handsome.&#34;  I am soooooooo smitten with Nathan that I recently ordered Firefly (2004) from Amazon. Oh, my!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|In my opinion, the finest of the three seasons.  Maybe it's the war, or maybe it's the start of real change, but the characters are alive in this!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Can't put it down. Highly recommend. Just another step in the Angry Bird fever. New bird styles are fun plus a few new added features.
B0095P29EG|4.0|fine adaptation of the Marvel comic version of the Norse God.  Chris Hemsworth's Thor is a Hell-raising hunk, and the supporting cast is well cast including Natalie Portman as Jane Foster, Anthony Hopkins as Odin, Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Stellan Skarsgard as Dr. Selvig.  Throw in Samuel L. Jackson and SHIELD and it's clear that the filmmakers are intent on adapting Marvel's multi-character multiple storyline multiple publication approach to bringing one of the publisher's epic tales to the big screen.  As other films are released it becomes clearer just which epic it is!
B009E3EWPI|5.0|If you loved Led Zeppelin, you've got to have it. Took me back to day of yesteryear. Seeing the group together with John Bonham's offspring was a sentimental trip well worth the admission.
B006RJTIF6|5.0|This political thriller, a favorite of President Kennedy, presented a chilling scenario of a military takeover of the United States government.  Subsequent actual events, as they have become more revealed over the years, make one pause to wonder, and shudder...

1451627297|4.0|Audio book performed by Craig Wasson, with an afterword by the author.<br /><br />The cover art and the title really tell the reader up front that the focus of this novel will be the Kennedy assassination, but King takes his sweet time getting there.  I'll admit I was a bit frustrated that it took King so long to get to the critical events of November 1963.  I knew he had to have a good reason for this, but I wasn't seeing it and I grew impatient.  This is NOT to say that the book is slow. Far from it.  King is a master at pacing a thriller to keep the reader turning pages.  And if he told me one more time that \\"the past is obdurate\\" ... well I was going to have to throw something at the CD player.  However, I grew to care about all the events Jake experienced long before he got to Dallas.  From the slang used to the fashions of the day and on to the small details, such as the price of gasoline, King immerses the reader in the \\"land of ago\\" and gives us a chance to recognize how very different that time was from 2011.  He forces us to think about \\"what might have been\\" and \\"where might we be today\\" if only ...<br /><br />However convoluted and long the journey, I'm glad I went along.  I was in tears (yes, in a Stephen King novel!) at the end of Chapter 31.  I really wish he had ended it there.  This is a novel that cries out for an ambiguous ending.  The last chapter - Citizen of the Century - seemed like an afterthought, and while it was nice to have some of the loose ends tied up, for THIS reader the impact of Chapter 31 was lessened.<br /><br />Craig Wasson was superb performing this audio. He even did a fair impersonation of real figures (Walter Cronkite and President John F Kennedy specifically), and had reasonably good regional accents.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is a great quality calculater. I love it a lot. you should try it. it has huge keys and amazing math. try it
B004GYY714|5.0|I got this as an App. for my Droid phone to listen to favorite talk programs on the road and to listen to Old Time Radio shows when traveling or at home on  my Mac.  The number of selections on this App. is tremendous.  TuneIn works faultlessly so far and the upgrades do not cause any glitches.<br /><br />If you like radio, I think you will like this one.
B009S6DDGK|5.0|Concept albums and rock operas are just one of those things that everyone has an opinion on.  By their very nature--usually the need for some sort of thematic continuity--they tend to lack the amount of variation one would expect from more 'standard' albums, and the introduction of narrative and overarching themes often gets seen as pretentious.  /Into the Electric Castle/, like nearly everything Ayreon does, clearly doesn't care about any of that and just does its own thing, and does it very well with excellent production values and high quality.<br /><br />Depending on how you look at it, the story either doesn't make much sense or it makes so much sense as to be banal: taking the latter first, a cast of characters is whisked away by a godlike voice and told that they must enter &#34;THE NUCLEAR PORTALS OF THE ELECTRIC CASTLE [guitar sting!],&#34; which, one must admit, sounds so overblown as to be absolutely awesome.  The characters are introduced, they proceed through various rooms and scenarios that draw out their archetypical characterizations further, quite a few 'perish' along the way, and then the final boss congratulates them on a job well done, explains what's up, then the survivors (at least) are put back where they belong.  A very simple premise backed up by excellently done and varied music, mostly of the prog rock and prog metal varieties--basically, if you tend to like &#34;progressive&#34; stuff, buy this album; if not, don't.<br /><br />As for not making sense, that depends one how deep one is in the Ayreon backstory and, dare I say it, meta-narrative.  Most of the Ayreon albums are roughly linked in that they exist in the same universe as /The Final Experiment/.  If one is expecting this to follow the plot of /The Final Experiment/ and the /Universal Migrator/ albums then this doesn't really fit until maybe the very end (and even then it's more of a thematic relationship than a chronological or &#34;universal&#34; one).  The Futureman character iswhat throws it off, since some of his lines suggest that the 2084 cataclysm didn't happen.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I chose 4 stars since it is a great little time killer and requires a degree of skill to guess/judge the angles of fire etc.<br />Not a 5 star since it gets a little too frustrating for me(I'm 65+) to keep trying till I figure it out.

B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|UPDATE: 09/09/2014<br />The Developer explained in great detail the evolution of the game.  I'm convinced now that the IAP is erroneous, just as they claim.  I've played the game through again - delightedly - and found no IAP.  I've asked permission to reprint his frank email here.  Meanwhile, I hope they get to the bottom of the mystery of the rogue code flags.<br /><br />UPDATE: 8/31/2014<br />Developer doesn't know why there is In-App Purchasing code in the game.  He's checking with the company that ports it over from iOS code to see why it is there.<br /><br />Robert~<br /><br />--- ORIGINAL REVIEW: This is a Breathtakingly Beautiful Game, with an Equally Stunning Soundtrack ---<br /><br />The epic nature and grandeur of Osmos cannot be overstated. This is one of the rare \\"top shelf\\" games that grace we Amazonians once in a while.  I certainly put this in the same category as World of Goo and Plants vs. Zombies.<br /><br />Simply, the objective (in most cases) is to grow to a certain size by absorbing smaller spheres without being absorbed by something larger or to be swallowed by the gravitational center in some levels.  There aren't very many levels, but in this case that's just fine, because the richness of the existing levels combined with the length of each of the levels make for a fulfilling experience.<br /><br />Osmos is NOT for the impatient!  It takes patience - a LOT of patience - and finesse to meet the objectives, which is essentially to grow bigger by absorbing smaller spheres.  There was a FAOTD recently, [[ASIN:B009LT1YZ6 Last Fish]], which has a similar goal, also with a great soundtrack, and was in black and white.  If you enjoyed [[ASIN:B009LT1YZ6 Last Fish]], you will fall in love with Osmos - this is, after all, the game that we used as the measuring board.  The developer refuses to state whether the environment is cellular, molecular or space; I tend to think of it as all of the above.  But it doesn't matter: all that matters is that you evolve.<br /><br />Regarding controls, it takes time to get used to the mechanic of moving around.  Here is where your patience and finesse really come into play, literally.  Don't get frustrated with yourself, as you've probably never tried to maneuver like this before... this really is a highly sophisticated physics game!!  Instead, relax and be gentle with the orb and you'll be rewarded.  Eventually, in some cases.  One more time, this game is designed to be a more relaxing experience.<br /><br />There is one caveat: you will want to play this on the highest definition screen you can find, and therefore it is NOT suitable for most phones!<br /><br />Hypnotic and mesmerizing, you'll find that this is one of those games that you'll want to relax and play alone in a quiet, comfortable surrounding.to the mechanic of moving around.

B00BHMETKC|5.0|We enjoyed learning the history from the movie even though some liberties were taken with the story.  The actors did an outstanding job portraying the stress and uncertainty of the situation.  This was a story that needed telling!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I guess the books are always better but there is just so much more to this story. The characters are amazing and I really love the format.

B005GFPZYK|4.0|This book is pretty good, at about 3/4 of the way through I did start getting a little tired of all the sniping stories but overall it was an incredible read. Very unfortunate that the author was killed, he is truly an American hero.

0062014536|1.0|I truly enjoyed the first book.  The second book wasn't the best, but the ending had me eagerly anticipating book three.  Book three was a let down.  I really liked the idea of bringing Hana back and getting to see her perspective, but the execution was terrible.  It was a very choppy read that dragged for most of the novel and a disappointing ending.
B000QRIGJY|4.0|I normally don't do reviews but I wanted to comment on the Harry Bosch series that I have recently started reading. I found Connelly's writing to be very similar to James Patterson's and he is my favorite. The Harry character is so down-to-earth and human.The story is easy to follow and the characters easy to remember.I plan to read all of the books in this series.I would recommend this series to all Patterson and Connely lovers.
B00B2DSK06|5.0|This is one of the best to come out of Disney in years!  Wreck-It Ralph is the best &#34;Bad&#34; guy ever to, sort of win a Hero's Medal,  rescue an outcast glitch and save every video game in the arcade.  Of course he does a little wrecking along the way, but hey that's Ralph.

B00B7IJBUY|1.0|I have been a Bon Jovi fan since day one (they were my second love)! This CD is the worst of them all! The last couple weren't great either - I have already put this one away and have no desire to listen to it again! What's happened to these guys? Too many years together? Burnt out? Jon and Richie not clicking? I just saw them recently live and I have to say I felt that the excitement and magic was gone. I felt they were going through the motions. God bless Jon for his energy and ability after all these years. The rest of the band, especially Richie didn't look happy at all. My gut feeling is that there is something going on amongst the band. I saw it live and now hearing this new cd proves it even more. Maybe it's time they take a break because the magic seems to be gone!

1938469011|3.0|The title of the book (probably not chosen by the author!) says that it's a \\"Practical Guide,\\" among other things.  But I didn't find it to be practical.<br /><br />My biggest issue with the book is that I thought it would be more practical.  Compared to \\"Yeast,\\" also in the Brewing Elements series, this book has very little authoritative advice about how to actually USE hops in brewing.  Don't get me wrong; the author does interview people who tell you (something) about different techniques they use for things like dry hopping.  But at the end of the day, the author doesn't say \\"and here's the best way to do it, for the following reason.\\"  In that regard, I did not find it very useful in everyday brewing.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong--I found this book somewhat enjoyable to read.  But that doesn't mean it would be a great book except for my misunderstanding of what it was going to be.  It's not the most exciting thing in the world, even for brewers.  It reads like decent journalism, since it's based overwhelmingly on interviews.  Some of the interviewees have a lot of experience and insight, but some do not.  I personally was less interested in abstract history--I like knowing the history, but I like it best as it relates to practice for today.<br /><br />So certainly one problem is with the Brewing Elements series, which needs better overall editorial focus:  Is it practical, or is it not?  That's probably the biggest problem.  I would recommend it for real hop lovers who also want to know a lot about history and hops as they are grown and as a commodity today.  But I don't think it is such a useful guide for brewing.

B000N2HBSO|5.0|I was left weeping- for the loss to the country- and to family- and to friends.  The book moved me carefully from a superficial and admiring understanding of a great American President to a the profound place of moved understanding.  Not only did I leave the book with a deep understanding of Lincoln- but an equally deep understanding of the country and of the tragedy of the Civil War. The speeches memorized as a child became living words on the page.  I am grateful for the gift of this book.
0425264351|5.0|This was the first Lee Child novel that I've read.  It is a fun read. Jack Reacher is a rough and tumble kinda guy.  He almost seems like a character that stepped out of the old west from Tombstone to deal out old fashioned justice.  The story shows you who Jack Reacher is from the first page, someone who noone is going to push around or intimidate.  And when it comes to his detective work, he is a great sleuth, with the nose of a blood hound for sniffing out clues. It is highly entertaining and a real page turner.
B00BC5AWNM|5.0|Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into. Against Basil's wishes, Basil's friend Lord Henry influences Dorian Gray.  Dorian looks at his portrait and realizes that while the portrait will stay young forever, he will grow old; so Dorian makes a wish that if only he could stay young forever and the portrait can age.<br /><br />At first Dorian does not realize his wishes been granted.  He falls in love with a beautiful young actor who is every woman that Shakespeare ever wrote about.  Once again, due to Lord Henry's influence, he realizes that she's just a common girl.<br /><br />Starting with absent-minded acts Dorian slowly sinks into debauchery.  Moreover, with every new act his picture becomes more grotesque while Dorian stays is young and as innocent looking as the day his picture was painted.<br />What will become of Dorian?<br />What will become of Dorian's painting?<br />What would you do if you were Dorian?<br /><br />Oscar Wilde paints a picture himself as he describes Dorian Gray's dilemma.  In addition, we as readers travel with Dorian as each decision is made.  In some places in the story, Oscar Wilde seems to drag on and on with detail; however we find that this detail is necessary to set the next scene.<br /><br />Oscar Wilde himself led a risky life that lead to a jail sentence; is attitudes can be seen in the dialogues in this book.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000OHBCI8 The Picture of Dorian Gray Starring: George Sanders, Hurd Hatfield]]

B004SKQAJI|1.0|This 21st century take on Irish dancing was not good. Mind you, of course the dancing is a marvel, and the people are talented, but this production is a FLOP! Firstly, it says it's rated G. There is no way my child under the age of 13 would be watching this. When the girls rip their costumes off, and choose to go with bras and underwear... to me it just belittles what everyone puts so much work into. Every scene was either really really dark, (i.e. skulls and demons and chants), crude (i.e. girls ripping their clothes off and doing nothing but being seducive, or like a cartoon (i.e. super light, frilly, with a jester clown pretending to play the flute.) I don't care how much it is, save your money and by the new Riverdance Live in Beijing on Blu-Ray. Amazing production and quality. Still a timeless show. Lord of the Dance will never be that, because it tries SO HARD to be current that they over do it on every level.
B003K15IF8|5.0|I had never heard of this book before, or the author, until I was reading an interview with another author whose novel I had just finished. When asked for his own personal favorite book list, that author had cited Stoner.  Intrigued, I downloaded it onto my Kindle and started to read.  Stoner is the type of book that is subtle in its insights and by taking you through the ordinary travails of a college professor's life, when all is said and done, the reader comes away feeling like you know this man, his heart and his mind. I don't understand why this book hasn't reached a more distinguished place in the galaxy of what is generally accepted as &#34;the  great books&#34;.  It would be an excellent choice for a college or high school reading list.

0375703764|4.0|House of Leaves is by first time novelist Mark. Z Danielewski. The post modernist horror romance tells the story of two narratives, one confined within the other. Johnny Truant, a troubled young man apprenticing at a tattoo parlor, comes upon the text, The Navidson Record, when his friend Lude calls upon him one late night to come over to his apartment building and investigate the death of an 80 year old blind attendant named Zampano. He takes the text from Zampano's apartment and brings it home. We are told from Johnny this is the beginning of a major mistake. He wonders back to this fateful night and what his life would look like had he left the text. Johnny discovers The Navidson Record to be written by Zampano himself and is about the documentary film of the same name. Although this film doesn't appear to exist anywhere. The film supposedly details the time a family spent at a house in Virginia and its supernatural qualities. The house has an interior structure that far exceeds its exterior capabilities. At first, a discovery is made that just by a slight miniscule bit the house is longer on the inside than the outside. This sparks suspicion from the owner and begins a inward discovery of the house to be a magical labyrinth of remarkable size. Friends and experts are called into investigate and a compelling story is detailed of the inner dimensions of the house. There is shape shifting, unreasonable sized distances, a mystical staircase that upon its own accord changes sizes, and all in a bleak, dark, texture less atmosphere. We read this narrative as if the book were in our hands. Meanwhile Johnny's life is detailed as if we had his journal and annotated notes of the book. Both narratives twist and weave together throughout Leaves. Neither is privileged as far as length, but the Navidson Record is obviously untouched by Johnny's narrative where Johnny's is utterly aware and affected by Navidson's.<br />  As mentioned The Navidson Record is encompassing, compelling, a serious page turner of suspense, horror and tragedy. It works wonderfully between the tale of a mind-bending architectural house and the assortment of family and friends that live in it, frequent it, and eventually explores its deepest cavities. Johnny's story can be touching and interesting at times, but also feels as if one is reading unnecessary diary entries. Scribbles and justifications that  could stay with Johnny  Whether we want to know or not, Johnny's life crumbles before us and he gets farther and farther into The Navidson Record. Through this we learn of the hardships he faced though and eventually of the psychotic mother who is institutionalized. After both narratives there is a collection of letters from the mother addressed to Johnny. Of Johnny's story these letters maybe the most substantial thing we find and personally found them the most interesting and telling to read.<br /> All together House of Leaves certainly can be a mind twister and psychologically grasping, but can dip into points of depravity and boredom. These may help in the overall construction of the novel, but that could be left for debate as they may just not be needed at all.

This movie was Awesome!!! Awesome Story and Awesome visuals! I loved how this movie looked in 3D on my TV. I thought this movie looked much better than Avatar looked in 3D on my TV!

0547848412|4.0|I listened to this book on audio with my dad when I was in eighth grade. We would listen to the book everyday on the drive to (and from) school. 5 years later, as a freshman in college, I went on a fiction-rampage and began reading as many novels as I could get my hands on. With the release of the movie, I knew that \\"Life of Pi\\" had to be at the top of the list (and I must admit that I remembered very little of the book from when I was an eighth grader). As I reread it, I was captivated from start to finish. The author does an incredible job with character development and provides the reader with very gripping dialogues. Moreover, the imagery that was painted in my head throughout the book was inspiring. It was excited to see the movie afterward and compare the boat, Richard Parker, the hyena, zebra, and orangutan, the tempestuous waves, the numerous sea creatures, the open ocean, the mysterious floating island, (etc.) with the producer's envisioning of them. As I read of the trials and heartaches that Pi faced, I felt as though I was on the boat with Pi, experiencing the loneliness with him. However, with each glimpse of hope, my heart was again captivated with Pi and hope was restored.<br /><br />Reservations: The book is filled with religious pluralism. Pi is a Muslim, Hindu, and Christian, all at the same time. As a Christian, I found myself squirming in my seat as I read the numerous dialogues in the book that pertain to this mindset. I obviously disagree with this perspective and think it is nonsense. However, it was interesting hearing Pi's sincere reasons for believing such things. I simply think he is wrong. Jesus Christ claimed that He was the only way to heaven: \\"I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me\\" (John 14:6). Thus Christianity is not compatible with the truth-claims of Islam or Hinduism. It saddens me that so many have adopted the notion that \\"all paths lead to God.\\" It is just not true; it cannot be true.<br /><br />Aside from my religious disagreements with the book, I enjoyed the read. It was compelling and rich. I give it 4 stars. Also, I might add that Yann Martel gives an incredibly convincing argument for the justification of zoos; I am convinced that animals can live fruitful and thriving lives in such an enclosed environment.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|As I was reading this book, I felt that the spirit of God was telling me there was something not right about it.  I felt it was not what Jesus said about Heaven.  This book was not for me.
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|I suggest you Rent the original movie Total Recall starring Arnold Schwartzenneger and Sharon Stone instead.  The acting, writing, and cast are much better than the new version.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Beautifully drawn animation (classic animation - hand drawn art which is losing to computers - too bad) Hayao Miyazaki is the master who all other animators should strive to emulate.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This is nothing but great. I got it free (for today) for my tablet, and it's perfect. One of the best Free-App-of-the-Day apps in a while. A good mix of hard and easy levels to make it challenging but enjoyable. The graphics are perfect, music is amazing, and physics are spot-on. Must have even for the original price.

B00165KRQU|5.0|I have always loved their sound. This is a wonderful collection.<br />The 80's sound was so unique and Duran Duran is a great example of how upbeat the music was.
B0091WUZJE|4.0|This is a classic western starring John Wayne.  Overall, I really like this movie, but there are a few sections that probably could have been edited out without disrupting the storyline.  Wayne's character is a little dark and sullen ....out of character for him....but for fans, still a solid performance!  This is definitely not my favorite western, but one I do enjoy watching from time to time!
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|This is an awesome movie. It could be very educational for high school and college students because of how it addresses alcoholism and relationships.<br />Even grade school kids could find this movie very exciting because of the flight scene, bravery and level headedness under pressure.<br />However the opening scenes themselves showing full frontal nudity makes this one untouchable for those not yet classified as adults. They should have made two versions of this interesting, exciting movie.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|We love all of the films by Hayao Miyazaki - this movie is beautiful, heartwarming, when it is over you feel good and want more.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Love the book. Had to read before the movie came out. I hope they make a sequal to the movie.
B008ZVXNX2|5.0|Beautiful and relaxing. Very enjoyable variety of music and powerful as well.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes classical music.
B009DKCBM8|4.0|I am a dedicated Neil Young fan.  I am a rabid Crazy Horse fan, especially Crazy Horse with Danny Whitten.  RIP, tortured soul.<br /><br />To be honest, I don't expect much from Neil Young's recordings any more.  I must say that I am very pleased with this album, however.  The first track is so good that I played it several times before I even finished the album.  I praise Neil for hitting that groovin' sweet spot in Driftin' Back and riding it *forever*.  About 18 minutes in, I had to look at the track list to believe my eyes, only to find that there were still 10 minutes of joy left!<br /><br />Maybe it is sobriety that has made the difference for Neil?  You can tell that he has that extra bit of sharpness taht only a clear mind can give.  Good stuff.

B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Fearless by Eric Blehm is the story of a daredevil, crack addict teen who became a member of the top special forces group in the United States military. Through God's grace, Adam Brown was able to become a husband, father, and special forces operator who gave the ultimate sacrifice for his brothers-in-arms.<br /><br />Eric Blehm had unparallelled access to Adam Brown's friends and family, as well as primary source documents such as military records, court documents, and letters. This is obvious in his recounting of Brown's life, as he is able to make the reader feel as though he/she knew Brown personally. Fearless seems almost like a novel because of the easy flow with which it reads. The raw honesty of Brown's failures and struggles make it easy to relate to Adam, as well as to root for him. Knowing that his life will be cut short in an act of sacrifice for those he served with made each triumph Brown experienced that much more poignant.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed reading Fearless and getting to peek into Adam Brown's life. Blehm treats his life with respect and balance, something I think Brown would have appreciated. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in biographies, special forces, or the power of God's grace in the life of one who is willing to surrender to Him.<br /><br />I received this book free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishers as part of their Blogging for Books book review bloggers program.

B001BC2ZS6|5.0|Before reading The Grapes of Wrath, I wanted to check out something of John Steinbeck's work.  I found this a very great introduction to his work.  I love his writing.  It is easy to see why I had heard that he wanted to write this to appear as a book and as a play.  What a very interesting style.

B00192IV0O|3.0|My only complaint about the seller of this store/where it came from, when I opened the package the CD case fell apart and it had a Crack on the cover. But the CD itself was unscratched and playable. I gave this as a gift for my sister on her birthday, she loved it! Besides the packaging problems, it came super fast for a last minute gift idea and it was cheap! Thank you!

B009NQKPUW|2.0|To many things happening, a &#34;I just can't let it go&#34; mindset from the characters charcters and an ending that leads to a sequell I really don't care to see. I was hoping for the fear and excitment of Alien and was given a lack luster cast, plot and ending. A real let down.
1616550414|5.0|I was really happy to find this book NEW and ON SALE! usually when i see this book online, its like $100.00! But i was able to purchase it through amazon for only $25.00!

B008Q0C248|4.0|Theis is a very faithful rendering of Hamlet, down to the language of Shakespeare. Therein may be the problem, as that language will be hard to follow. Beautiful yes, but you better have a fore knowledge of what's going on by reading Hamlet or seeing a previous Hamlet play to follow along. The filming, acting, a scenery are all brilliant. In fact, I am sure the great actors in this play were thrilled to do the brilliance of Shakespeare, - the wonderful storyline and the chance to show how good you are at acting. My poor husband who was all new to this. -loved the storyline, but was frustrated at the language, who was what, etc. Those who love Shakespeare will want to give this five star or more. Those who are just movie going, average people, will be frustrated and lost, but wanting to catch what even they can see is a great story. I bet they would give it a two star. So I,ll average it out to a four star.
B00336C3EY|3.0|\\"Demanding at many parts to say the least but at least I can say that I have seen the Creating 1967 and Hebrew and Yiddish for the Goyim features on the DVD. A Serious Man is a twisty and quirky drama about a Minnesotan-Jewish professor who sees his life spiral down with his son, family, and encounters.<br /><br />Larry Gopnik is our observer and victim of what goes and will go wrong and the film takes an often omnipresent and very philosophical nature of mental breakdowns intertwined with the complexities of one's relationship to their faith or religion. A purely Jewish film at heart that manages to take much of the tales (like in the beginning between the dybbuk and an emotionally-strung couple) and conversations about the work of Hashem and of the Torah; henceforth, there are not many like it out there.<br /><br />While a lot is to be questioned about through its consistent metaphors is a good thing, the whole mood and feel of the film is quite difficult to pin-point out given its social-religious commentary, themes, and sparing environment where some characters appear and that is it (Ms. Samsky, Danny and Sarah Gopnik) and some scenes are just left to the imagination a bit too much. The Coens, as always, do employ their signature dark humour in the film by focusing on ironic situations through scenes that involve a confrontation, a fight, and a discussion of life.<br /><br />This film is more held in its place and less overrated than No Country for Old Men but still suffers from perceivable aspects of plot and characterisation because of the philosophy behind its film's ready-for-discussion-at-the-end vibe.\\"

B001FVV2X2|4.0|This ultra creepy sci-fi series is like the X-Files on steroids. And it gets better as it goes on. The long arc starts revealing itself toward the end of the first year so it takes a little patience but the reward is an amazing journey. Sometimes truly horrifying but sometimes just nauseating, so be warned this may not be okay for the weak of stomach.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love how realistic this game is! I wish it wasn't so hard to earn enough gems for a unicorn!

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is so stupidly easy, but it's so addictive! This game is simple enough to allow for multitasking; for example, watching your favorite show while playing the game! One of the best parts of the game is it doesn't require the internet to play so you can play during long car trips or while waiting in a waiting room at the doctor's office!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Fun game but takes too long to reginerate coins!! needs to get coins faster or add more bonus coins in game play. although I guess its good to run out of coins otherwise I would play this silly game for hours. lol!
B004LROUNG|2.0|John Grisham writes some mediocre books and some great stories - this one goes in the mediocre file. The characters are poorly developed, one never really feels invested in the entire middle of the book. Cannot recommend.
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|This is the apex of comics written by one of the secret masters of comics. The year the Watchmen ran as a serial had a Christmas (or maybe a Halloween?) every month. The entire history of comics is recapped and reinvented in this remarkable work. If you are a comic fan and haven't caught up with this one yet stop right now and buy it. Bring it home and read it for the first of what's likely to be several times.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|enough said! it works when asleep or when program is not running or when kindle is off! I luv it for that alone. GREAT APP!
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Washington continues to provide solid and incredible performances. Truly one of Hollywood's all time great actors. This film was just amazing. I could have been completely happy with this film winning best picture. If you are a fan of his previous efforts and enjoy a good dramatic tale, give this one a watch.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|Totally filled with action, romance and drama- its a great 007 film!  I think Daniel Craig makes an excellent James Bond
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The story is  a lot like many suspense stories, but there is so much distraction and enjoyment in parts that you forget the awfulness and get so absorbed in the budding relationship going on between the waitress and the widower and his family. Their meeting and getting to know one another is so easy and slow, but entertaining and draws you in,sweetly.<br /> Then, as their relationship seems to finally take hold the story goes back to Boston, where it began. The policeman, consumed with rage, and bent solely on finding her, and only her is found out for what he is, an alcoholic. His supervisor suspends him.So, now he spends ALL his time looking for her, driving to N.C. and searching the 4th of July crowds until he can find her<br /> The rest is best left for the reader to find out for themself......

B007REV4T8|4.0|I've been a life long Bond film and when I first saw Skyfall in the theater I have to admit I was at a loss. I came away really not having enjoyed the film and was curious why I seemed unable to see in it what everyone else was seeming to find in it. Well I bought the film and watched it a second and a third time and I can now say that my initial reaction to the film was completely wrong.<br /><br />Skyfall is an incredible film. The pace and story are perfect for a Bond venture and the action is engrossing and compelling. Craig delvers yet again. What I thought was perhaps the worst Bond film now has become one of my all time favorites, I can't say enough about BERENICE MARLOHE. She is in my opinion perhaps the best actress to ever grace a Bond film. Even during my initial viewing of the film, her performance stood out. She is as masterful as she is beautiful.<br /><br />The only down side to the film that I have is the fact that Bond slept with the new Moneypenny. The sexual tension and playful seduction that has always existed between the two characters is destroyed by having them realize it's intentions. The magic that has always been a staple of that unresolved relationship was, I feel, unfortunately destroyed in this film. This is the same type of thing that destroyed the magic in MOONLIGHTING when Willis' character and Shepard's character finally hooked up. After that, nobody cared.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I read this book with my son and Daughter.  they really enjoyed reading it and I found myself wondering what was going to happen next.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|Great and interesting points. Brings a new perspective on life and the circumstances we all live with and deal with. Some chapters seem a little off topic and don't seem to go with the rest of the book, but other then that great read.
1451620829|4.0|Read the Peter Criss book Make up to Break up.  It was a very informative and insightful book.  You just have to realize that it is from HIS perspective.  I have read Gene Simmons books and Ace Frehley's book and the similar stories and recounting of various events vary depending on who's book you read.  It's very unfortunate that they can't get along, but after reading Peter Criss' book I can sort of understand why.  That being said, it does get a bit tiring when Criss wants to blame everyone else for his decisions in the past regarding financial and business decisions.  He could have walked away from the reunion, in my opinion, if the money wasn't an equal split.  All three of the other guys needed it just as bad as he did at the time.  I understand why he didn't as the IRS is a pretty big monkey to have on your back.  But to his credit he does accept that he could have and should have made better decisions regarding finacial packages and legal representation.<br /><br />Hindsight is 20/20 and one can only hope he learned his lessons.  By all accounts in the book, he has and has moved on with his life to a much better place.  I have no doubt Gene Simmons can be, and actually is, an ass.  We all know that.  But my daddy once told me \\"the trick to dealing with a snake in the grass is first accepting the fact that there is indeed a snake in the grass\\".  I guess sometimes you have to find out the hard way.  Mr. Criss obviously was bitten quite a few times in his career.  But, he's come out the other side a much wiser and humble man.<br /><br />Mr. Criss seems to be in a better place these days and that's a good thing.  Letting go of the past and those who you feel have wronged you, is a huge step.  Towards the end of his book he seems like he's put that all behind him and made peace with it and his past.  It's too bad some relationships were burned to a crisp in the process.  But I guess that's life sometimes.  I wish him nothing but the best.  He was afterall an early influence on me as a musician.  I wish him nothing but happiness, good health and good fortune.  Thank you for the book sir and God speed Mr. Criss, God speed.

B005HEFB6M|3.0|Love the stories. The Captain Archer and Tapal characters are a little too shallow and predictable. And Dr. Flox (sp?) should learn how to use his whole mouth when he speaks. Otherwise, it's a fun, interesting escape into a possible future in the stars.

B0044C3RB4|5.0|This series remains creative through its third year, offering imaginative and generally witty shows that are well acted and creatively directed.  For those willing to &#34;suspend disbelief&#34; (as poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge once suggested) to accept the basic premise of the series -- and who can use Amazon to pause-rewind-play-it-again-sam to examine more confusing aspects, it's a great series.

B000GCFO0I|3.0|It's certainly no SILENCE OF THE LAMBS or OMEN, nor even CITIZEN KANE, but as far as videogame-based movies go, SILENT HILL is actually not too bad. That is to say, it's not a particularly great film by any means, but compared to the likes of SUPER MARIO BROS, DOUBLE DRAGON, STREET FIGHTER, and even the MORTAL KOMBAT movies, this is at least more watchable. About a mother who searches for her missing daughter in a titular city (a \\"ghost town\\", in other words), SILENT HILL looks appropriately gritty and nightmarish. The town itself is stunningly realized, whether in its \\"natural\\" ash-covered state, or in its darkened periods in which specters rise from the dead. Director Chrisophe Gans made a solid effort to say true to the tone of the game, and his palette of dark, gloomy colors, is commendable.  Indeed, the cinematography and atmosphere are the film's strongest assets.  The performances, too, are better than one might expect, with Radha Mitchell pulling off the role of the mother (dedicated to find her missing daughter) with all that she can and there's rarely a false note in her performance, and she's surrounded by other good actors such as Sean Bean, and Alice Krige as a seemingly benevolent but corrupt magistrate.  But the film's strongest asset is the use of Akira Yamaoka's music from the games themselves. It has always annoyed me that many of these game-turned-movies don't even TRY to use the original tunes from their source material.  Because this movie is an exception, it gets points.  Which isn't to say that SILENT HILL is perfect.  It still has some faults, one of which is the mostly useless subplot involving Bean's character. He spends most of the film searching in the rain for his missing wife, but his character arc never really goes anywhere and there's no major payoff for his journey at the end. It's not Bean's fault; he does a credible job, but I think the film would be stronger if his sidestory was excised. There are also a few moments when the storyline can get somewhat confusing, and the dialogue can be hit and miss at times. Some scenes may be too gory for one's taste as well, particularly the climactic showdown.  Still, considering the circumstances, SILENT HILL deserves credit for taking itself seriously and delivering a cautionary warning.  For a movie based on a videogame, this is about as close as one can get to pulling off a half-decent effort.  It doesn't belong on the greatest movies of all time list, but for what it is, it is a competently made, if not seamless, thriller.line can get somewhat confusing, and the dialogue can be hit and miss at times.

B0086213XW|2.0|I watched over half of it.  I usually love Michelle Williams, but I found her character in this movie to be annoying and her relationship with Seth Rogan's character was childish.  I thought Luke Kirby was great as a quirky artist. I finally had to turn it off.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|Follow along with the charming people of Candleford (city folks) vs. Lark Rise (community folks) and their daily interactions.  Lots of busy bodies meddling in other people's business. Like I mentioned earlier soap operas.

B007REV4YI|4.0|As usual this was an entertaining bond. The only reason that I did not give it a 5 star rating was that I'm not sold on Daniel Craig as being the best Bond out there. I feel there are better, more attractive young actors that could fill the bill better.
0895260131|1.0|Political correctness is a term invented by people (mainly on the extreme right) who can't accept that most scholars disagree with them, whether the subject is Islam, global warming, darwinism... If most mainstream books on Islam were discredited by being politically correct, a politically incorrect guide could be of value. But it's not. Spencer is the one who is colored by political views, not mainstream scholars. Seek information about Islam elsewhere, from real scholars, with real arguments. The fact that Spencer writes for a series as politically colored as the politically incorrect guides, really says it all.<br /><br />The (politically) incorrect guides remind me of Will's rant about the country being more polarized than at any time since the civil war, in the excellent television series Newsroom: \\"People choose the facts they want now...\\". That is certainly true of those who read Robert Spencer.

1451627297|5.0|When readers hear the name Stephen King, I'm sure many think of his hits that were turned into movies. Those like Carrie, Pet Cemetery, or Cujo. If you've seen these movies or read the books, you know King has the ability to write gruesome stories, yet keep the story interesting enough that the horror doesn't take away from the plot.<br /><br />Still, many people don't enjoy horror, including me. At least these days. I used to LOVE King's horror stories, but I've grown out of them.<br /><br />That's why 11/22/63 surprised me. I know King's books aren't all horror, but this one was different for me. It was easy to tell King was the one who wrote it. It had his humor, his attention to character detail and intricacies, but the feel was different.<br /><br />I wasn't even alive when President Kennedy was assassinated, yet the idea behind this book was intriguing because of the stories my parents told. They couldn't tell much, but they knew exactly where they were when they heard the president was killed. They knew the feeling, the horror, and the sadness. I couldn't wait to hear what ideas King could create during this time period.<br /><br />King sucks you in from the very first chapter. It helped that I had an idea of what the book was about, but it wouldn't have mattered. You're given tension, a great plot idea, and flawed characters right from the beginning.<br /><br />The characters? Amazing as always. Each character has their quirks, their small details that make them real whether it's the way they say a specific word, the way they wear their hat, or the way they smell.<br /><br />If you haven't heard yet, 11/22/63 is a HUGE book. The hardcover edition is listed at 849 pages. Not a big deal if you're an epic fantasy fan such as myself, but if you're not used to books this long, you may get bogged down.<br /><br />Getting bogged down wasn't possible for me throughout most of the story because the intensity and interest level were kept on over-drive. If there was one area where a reader may get bogged down it would be during a part when the main character just observes. It was interesting, but I personally could have used a little more action, or had it broken up a little more. That was around page 500 or so, and went on for around 50 pages.<br /><br />However, if I was alive during that time period, or if I was a history buff, the details alone probably would have kept me interested. I also wonder if this was King's idea of the calm before the storm. There wasn't necessarily a calm, but once this part was over, I flew through the rest of the book.<br /><br />Other than that one portion, I have no complaints. It was one of my top three favorites by Stephen King, maybe even my favorite.<br /><br />If you enjoy typical Stephen King, you should try it. The same goes if you're into historical fiction, alternate histories, time travel stories, the Kennedy assassination, or just an awesome book.<br /><br />This book is well worth the read.e area where a reader may get bogged down it would be during a part when the main character just observes.

B000002JSP|5.0|I came to be a Zeppelin fan from a different angle, I was listening to late 70's hard core punk and avoided the old hated rockers. This was the 1st album (yes, album) that I bought from their catalog. Well many years later, I decided to pick up the cd, having not  heard much of it in years. I've dug deep into the old, original Blues masters because of the early covers that  the Zep did and appreciate what they did even more now.<br />As far as this, their final, complete release I still think it stands proud on it's own. I think the &#34;controversy&#34; around  &#34;Carouselambra&#34; boggles my mind as it seems a logical musical progression along the lines of &#34;The Rain Song&#34; and &#34;Achilles Last Stand&#34; and is one of my favorite tunes. &#34;Hot Dog&#34; just goes to prove that Jimmy Page still can't play country guitar and presages Robert Plants collaboration with Allison Krauss, by decades to be sure. Really it's a bold step for the band, even if it didn't work. I wonder what would have happened if they had put &#34;Darlene&#34; on here instead of releasing it on Coda.
0765325950|5.0|A reminder here that I try for no spoilers, but don't read on if you're worried I may give something away. I haven't had any complaints yet, but I know I'm the type of reader who wants to know virtually nothing about the storyline of the next book in a series I'm reading. There's your fair warning.<br /><br />Sanderson had hundreds of main characters, and hundreds of story arcs, to cover in this one. A close friend and I have discussed how this series would end for years and neither of us could comprehend how Sanderson could put the finishing touches on this one. While there were a couple small areas we complained about after finishing the series, the rest of the story was amazing enough that it didn't change the way we felt one bit. The Wheel of Time series is, and will continue to be, one of the greatest epic fantasies ever told.<br /><br />I didn't think it was possible, but Sanderson kept an unbelievable pace throughout the entire novel. The chapters and sections were shorter than in previous WoT (Wheel of Time) books, but not only did it work well, I believe it was needed in this case. The reader is all over the map at first as we're brought into the state of mind of all the characters and reminded where we're headed: Tarmon Gai'don, the final battle, possibly the end of all things.<br /><br />The final battle isn't just one battle, but many. Some on a larger scale and some that are small yet lead to larger fights that may or may not be known by the other characters. Matrim, Perrin, Rand, Egwene, Nynaeve, Lan, Tam, and I could go on, all have their part to play, and they're each significant.<br /><br />Best Aspects of the Book<br /><br />Sanderson keeps to the storyline and to Jordan's vision of an epic story while continuing to focus on the individuals and their actions that brings us to the final climax.<br /><br />Again, THE PACING! I swear my heart was racing through almost every page of this darn book. Not just the battle scenes, but with every decision the characters made bringing us closer to the end of the world, and the book.<br /><br />The epic battle scenes. Sorry for using the word \\"epic\\" again, but it's the only word that encompasses the breadth of this story. The tactics, the blood, the soldiers, the individuals; they all play significant roles in the final battle. Another reviewer said something similar, but the way the scenes played out it was as if Sanderson had first hand knowledge of that battle, as if he were there copying down what he saw.<br /><br />Many may not see this as a positive, but it made the book more realistic in my opinion. Characters are dying all over the place in this one. It makes sense considering it was the final battle. If we'd had this grand battle to only have a few characters die, not only would it not have been as realistic, but the reader wouldn't be on the edge of their seat wondering when their other favorite characters were going to \\"wake up from the dream,\\" as the Aiel would say.<br /><br />Sanderson completed so many story arcs in one this one book that it was simply amazing. In a recent conversation with the friend I mentioned above, we discussed how Sanderson could have easily written another four or five books in the series with each of those story arcs being a story of their own.<br /><br />The Negative Aspects<br /><br />With how much I loved this story, it's hard for me to say anything negative. However, I try to keep an unbiased tone when I write a review, though that's pretty much impossible in this situation. While I say some of these things are negative, it's only my opinion and other readers may disagree.<br /><br />Where was Thom Merrilin? No, he wasn't removed from the story, and he played an important role, but I loved his character and I wanted more. With the how big of a part of the story he was throughout, I thought there would be more.<br /><br />There were some parts that were 100% Sanderson, particular lines especially. He sticks to a Jordanesque stylethroughout the previous two books he wrote, yet in this one, I felt there were times when the things he wrote were something Jordan probably would have done so differently. Of course, we'll never know, and I've no doubt that Sanderson did the better than any other author could have in his position. My argument against this is that I'm not sure Jordan could have completed this series the way Sanderson did, and that's saying a lot, because I love Jordan's writing. Before this book, I wasn't completely sold that Sanderson could finish the WoT series the way it should have been. Now, I can see that Robert Jordan and his wife picked the perfect author to finish this epic story.<br /><br />This part goes with one of the positive aspects. I mentioned that Sanderson completed so many story arcs above, but there were some I wish he'd spent more time on. \\"Wish\\" is the key word there. We all wish we could read more of our favorite book or series, but that's just not possible. I won't mention which one, but there was one point that had been alluded to almost since the first book, and then when we reach the actual moment, it's over in less than two pages. I can't complain too much, the story arc was completed, even if not in the way that I had imagined.<br /><br />The actual ending. I could probably put this in both the positive and the negative. In my mind, it fit perfectly. So why does it go in the negative section? Because, in my mind, there were just enough questions left that the ending read like the final line was a precursor to the next book in the series, which of course we won't have. I think my brain is still working on what exactly I think about everything.<br /><br />I give A Memory of Light by Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson five of five stars, and the series itself, five of five stars. If you're looking for a true epic fantasy with an epic story line, an epic cast, and now an epic ending, the Wheel of Time is for you.throughout the previous two books he wrote, yet in this one, I felt there were times when the things he wrote were something Jordan probably would have done so differently.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|Season 2 - Great Series, I throughly enjoyed watching this on Amazon Prime!  I am so glad that this series was offered there, I wish Season 3 was also on Prime.  I've been watching it on my Mini Ipad...just an awesome series.

B0081336FO|5.0|Season 2 was as exceptional as Season 1! I've just read that readings for Season 3 are now under way but it looks like we'll have to wait until 2014 to see them. Much too far away. I'll just have to see Seasons 1 and 2 again.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|A friend recommended this book and I cant thank her enough.  I loved this book. It was well written and I really felt like I cared for the characters.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|I have enjoyed watching Downton Abby, the cast is great especially Maggie Smith whose one liners are perfect! Patiently waiting for season three to be available.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I've never written a review before but I had say how much I love this series. I've always been a big fan of Jeremy Brett's Sherlock as the best and I never miss Elementary, but this pairing of Holmes and Watson is by far the very, very best ever.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|I should have assumed as much because I'm not a huge fan of Family Guy or other Seth McFarlane spin offs.  Had a nice ending though.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|First and foremost this is the definitive alien set.  It's got incredible extras, theatrical and director cuts of the movies, and is just amazing.  Even the case is pretty damn neat.<br /><br />The problem is a niggling technical issue.  20th Century Fox has gone out of its way to place more restrictive DRM on its bluray movies.  This makes playback on PCs difficult.  Interestingly enough, it absolutely DOES  NOT make ripping the damn things any more complicated, just watching them.  You know, watching the movies you've already payed for.  With money.<br /><br />The solution is to either download a bluray rip, rip a copy for yourself, or pay for a janky, overpriced piece of proprietary software like PowerDVD.<br /><br />The point is, what the hell kind of benefit is this DRM if it only punishes people who went out and bought the movie, when they could have downloaded the stupid thing much more quickly, easily, and cheaply.<br /><br />As a customer it's a bad feeling to not be able to view something I paid for.  Knock this DRM  [ *** ] off.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|It is what you would expect, but it makes the game a little easy.  I was playing and put the same number is two spots in a column.  They app marked it in red to let me know.  Yes is saved me time trying to find where I made the mistake, but I feel like I am cheating.  Otherwise, the app is great.  Lots of puzzles, and easy to use.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|The extensive detail that Victor Hugo uses to pull you into the period of the French civilization can be quite overwhelming.  You have to dig through, sort through, figure out, and get on with the plot when he gets around to it.  But, it is worth it.  Having just experienced the election of the new Pope Francis, I can not help but draw a parallel between him and the Bishop.  Both holy simple men, giving their riches to the poor, living in poverty themselves.  What a coincidence.  This is a book worth the time investment in it's reading.
B006P96PAO|5.0|Since the acting is done by church bets and not professionals, its starts off a little slow.  But after the first few minutes the story sucks you in and you forget about it.  I have seen this movie 3 times with my 11 year old and we love it more each time.  Great story and tests of faith.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Good as the original supplied with my Kindle. But, let's face it, there is nothing bad about a Kindle. I've had my Kindle for three years and it's best electronic thing I ever bought.
B001UGB1X8|2.0|I wasn't thrilled with this production.  The plot didn't really flow but felt more like it was provided in chunks leaving one to try to fillin the blank spaces.  The photography was very good as was the scenery, accurately depicting southern Louisiana as a wet, hot and muddy part of the US.  Tommy Lee Jones tends to mumble a lot which made the dialogue a little difficult to pick up.  So it wasn't an awful movie but not a great one either.
1439170916|4.0|Who would have thought that a book about cancer could be such a page turner?  Truly enlightening.  I'm passing this book on to the wife of a dear friend who's in &#34;the Battle&#34; right now.
B006M7JCC2|4.0|I simply loved this book.  I would have liked to have begun reading about Anita's NDE before the background on her life, but that's probably just because I wanted to get to the 'good' stuff.  This is a must read for people who are curious, people who are facing their own eminent death, or if you have lost someone you love.  It is comfort food for the soul.
B00001U0GQ|5.0|This film captures Daniel's acting expertise both in physical and emotional spheres.  It made me a life long fan. The story, of course, is a sliver of the making of America, and the fate of the Native Peoples.
B000HF0KXU|3.0|First, I would like to say that this film should have won an oscar for costume design.  Putting Hugh Jackman in nothing but a towel is sheer brilliance.<br /><br />Now, to the movie.  Overall, it is very much a guy flick.  There are car chases, Halle Berry's boobs, no romantic theme (other than Hugh Jackman's love for his daughter), etc.  There is not much to hold a typical females interests, other than Hugh Jackman in a towel and that is only for about 5 minutes.<br /><br />Overall, the performances are pretty good.  If you haven't guessed, I'm a big Hugh Jackman fan.  Besides being gorgeous, I do believe he is a magnificent actor that can play pretty much any type of role, effectively.  He shows that here, playing a geeky ex-con, who's only love is his young daughter.  There is not much meat to the character, nor is there meant to be.  This type of movie doesn't require it.  It is not an oscar worthy performance, but he is always wonderful to watch.  Halle Berry is wasted in this role.  She is a very good actress and her role is basically a toady for John Travolta.  She does a good job with what she is given, but that role could have easily been played by any typical tough guy, except for the boobs part.  I have never been a big John Travolta fan, and I'm still not.  I think he can play two roles, the goofy, lovable guy (ie Welcome Back Kotter, Grease) or the brooding tough guy.  In this film, he is the brooding tough guy.  I saw no difference between the character of Gabriel Shear and Vincent Vega from Pulp Fiction.  There were just different lines.<br /><br />Overall, Swordfish is a film that you won't remember much in 10 years.  But, it is fun and is a great film to watch with your significant other on a cold winter night.  They guys will love the car chases, flying buses and Halle Berry's boobs.  The chicks will rewind back to Hugh Jackman in a towel every time the guy goes to the bathroom.  Overall, definitely worth a rental.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|This series is the craziest thing I have ever seen.  It is almost like a car accident, you can't look away and afterward you're not sure you really wanted to see that.  However it's fascinating.

B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|An app for the casual gamer who plays not to just kill time but also to wind down at the end of a day or relax on a long flight. Great sleep-friendly background music and visuals. &quot;Absorbing&quot; gameplay with just enough challenge to want to keep going but not so much to frustrate. Would have gladly bought it but loved that it was free for the day.
B00AU15HPC|1.0|Not impressed with these blah songs and lousy production. Drums sound like crap! The phoney Americana attempts with a bad sounding dobro stick out like a sore thumb. What happened?  I've followed Justin Hayward since the early days of the Moody Blues but this album is just a dog.
B000IMKDPC|5.0|I love, love, love, love, love superhero movies.  They have something for everyone.  They have action scenes and sometimes scantily clad women for the guys and they sometimes have romance and scantily clad men for the chicks.  They are not normally oscar contenders, but they are almost always one hell of a time.<br /><br />The X-Men series is my favorite superhero series of all time.  It has the best characters, the best actors, the best romance, the best action scene and there is always the required scene of Hugh Jackman shirtless.  You can't beat this cast: Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen and Anna Pacquin. All of them give wonderful performances.<br /><br />Then this series has my favorite superhero of all time, Wolverine.  He is sexy, flawed, vulnerable and badass.  You just can't wait to see what he will do next.  Hugh Jackman has made this character his own and that makes for an awesome film.  Of course it only helps that he is surrounded by an outstanding cast.<br /><br />I love that the X-men were born this way.  They didn't come from another planet, they weren't bit by a radioactive spider nor were they born with enough money to buy themselves enough toys.<br /><br />Even the story line is fun and exciting.  They were able to weave in an interesting storyline while still spending a decent amount of time on characterization.<br /><br />The weakest person in the bunch was Famke Janssen as the love interest.  I didn't get the attraction and there was no chemistry between her, James Marsden or Hugh Jackman.  Lynn Collins, from Wolverine Origins was much more plausible and effective.<br /><br />This series is so good, that the best film in the series is the 4th installment.  What an amazing achievement.  I highly recommend all the movies in the X Men series.

B0062NAVXA|5.0|A very good and inspirational production! Keep up with the great work!<br />We need more great movies like this one!
B008XG1X18|5.0|It's nice to have an app on your phone so you can look up things you saved while you are on the go.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I loved this book!!  I was waking up in the middle of the night just so I could see what happened next!  Such a great read!  And if you think you know how it's going to end, Think Again!!! :)
B00499NHLC|5.0|This Sherlock reboot is extremely well done. They have done a superb job in meshing the early 20th century story lines with 21st century technology. Cumberbatch and is masterfully arrogant in his portrayal of Holmes, and  Freeman's affable and friendly Watson is endearing.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Dr. Alexander is an excellent writer, and he is probably a superior neurosurgeon.  If he had been on my case, he might even have been as wise and cautious as my own neurosurgeon for many years in repeated MRI monitorings of my rather large but stable, un-operated, benign brain tumor.  Had he become a lawyer instead of a doctor, he probably would have been a superior and very highly persuasive courtroom litigator before uninfomed courts and jurors.  Also, it is probable that he earned by the merits of his own loving kindness the blessings of his loving and supportive family throughout his personal medical ordeal.  As a personal report, this is an interesting book.<br /><br />However, Dr. Alexander is not a careful scientific thinker nor a careful neurological diagnostician of his own medical crises.  And he seems to know nothing of the cultural relativity and developmental psychology of cognitive processes and creative imagination.<br /><br />Had he known these  subjects as well as he knows his own, he would not have been so quick and so sure to label the hallucinatory experiences of his nearly catastrophic meningial infection as &#34;Proof&#34; of anything--beyond the presence of extraordinary, apparently sustained, hallucinatory experiences resulting from extremely severe trauma to the cerebral cortex.  In this respect, his book is a superb demonstration of the power of individual creative response to elaborated and perhaps nearly fatal brain trauma.  His reports do not constitute the demonstrable proof of heaven, or anything else, except his willingness to see and assert some approach to universal meaning in his own highly personal and culture-bound hallucinatory experiences.<br /><br />Signed: Professor X, Research Professor of Human Development, Emeritus, at an established New England university
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This one will linger for decades.  We'll see this one offered as a favorite rerun for a long time.  Very well done.
0061537969|5.0|When my wife first told me about this book, my reaction was,\\" It's about what?\\" Fortunately she prevailed to have me read it (in one long sitting as I could not put it down). Anyone who has ever had and/or loved a dog will love this masterful poignant tale told entirely through canine eyes. Though it contained more about auto racing that I ever needed to know, the story is compelling and the author's ability to use this forum is nothing short of awe inspiring.<br />Wilmont
B004VMUS9G|4.0|My Kindle doesn't have an alarm on it. My phone had died so I downloaded this, worked for what I needed. Thanks.
B003NRYMZQ|3.0|Although this series is usually just my kind of viewing, I found it strangely uncompelling. I could not suspend my disbelief. Sometimes, I have this reaction until I give it time to work on me. Not so this time, even after viewing 3 episodes.
B0095P2YXC|1.0|My wife was actually watching this while I was out at a meeting.  I came home and saw the last half and ending.  I'not a fan of torture porn and thought this was putrid.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Absolutely wonderful...I couldn't put it down.  Very imaginative the characters and the setting are well thought out and fully developed.  I am extremely anxious for more!!
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Nice effects.  Some unexpected twists.  Big ending!  Nice long story, kept me glued all the way through.  Do the biggest screen you can find with this one!
B00AU15HPC|5.0|This is an absolutely beautiful album!  I was surprised to truly love the bluegrass songs...gorgeous arrangements! Justin is always so precisely true to the recorded versions of his songs when he plays live with the Moodys (which I really appreciate) that it is like a refreshing breeze to listen to those new arrangements of Broken Dream and It's Cold Outside of Your Heart! Personally I would have left the 15th track off the album, but that's just me...probably appeals to a much younger audience. I love every other song and highly recommend the artful album!
B0088WJDPK|5.0|This a tremendous series! The story line continuity and character depth is expanded upon as with prior seasons. Definitely a worthy evolution and successor to the genre pioneered and developed by spock, kirk and Picard.
B009NQKXYK|4.0|I have enjoyed just about everything Ridley and Tony Scott have done, both movie and TV. This was a surprise in that it answered all those questions that the original Alien movies left unanswered. A must-see for all you Alien/Ridley Scott fans.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|Tommy Lee Jones was my draw to this movie. I enjoyed the setting in the south and appreciated the good acting.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Love this TV show and was glad to see it on sale. Results in many laughs and good times while watching.
B00526ZKYS|4.0|I think it's very sweet and it shows a side of us girls saying we don't just care about our clothes
B000HL0EEE|3.0|kind of a slow starting series in my opinion but it sets the a\stage for the rest of the series very well. It is not that it is bad just not as action filled (to me) as the others.
B001KQ7IZ8|4.0|While not as thoughtful as Foxtrot, Genesis manages to create a sound that was totally lost when PG left the group.  His voice was at it's absolute peak on this piece and his lyrics were always thought provoking.  Great stuff.
B005HSL626|5.0|Its so easy to play, my 5 yr old son loves to play it on the way home from school.  Love it
0812550706|5.0|One of my most favorite books of all time. Recommended to all people, even if you arent a sci-fi fan. I liked it so much that I picked up Enders Shadow which Im also enjoying.
B005FITIDC|5.0|A really good movie.  What an eye opener to the horrific treatment of the people of Africa.  It was different than what I expected but was a movie you should see.
B0095P29EG|4.0|Good movie... I'm an Ironman fan... This wasn't as good but still entertaining! I enjoy the lead up to The Avengers.
B000HKYN74|5.0|This is a continuation of season 2 and is just as good and has a few twists in it as well.
B009JZTOG8|1.0|I enjoyed the first season and found myself watching this and wondering if I had previously been delusional.  The dialogue is appalling.  Scenes are overplayed and heavily underscored by emotionally redundant music.  I was so disappointed.  The acting was bad.  Even Robert Carlysle had trouble pulling off this script.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Ms Flynns writing kept me so captured that I had to take a break before reading her third book. (I downloaded all three). I couldn't figure out the finale till the end.<br />The book was well written with characters that kept me enthrall end. I hope she will be writing more.
B005LAIII0|5.0|Wow! I can now see why this film was up for the awards that it was up for, and why Ang Lee received the best Director nod by the Academy. This was a beautifully done movie and the most amazing thing in my perspective was that the majority of the whole movie was done in CGI! While I had not read the book, I am now inspired to do so, and hope that I will be equally impressed by the writing as I was with the movie.<br /><br />The acting of Infan Khan was wonderful, and he truly embodies his character and allows you to see not only the joy that he has in his life but also the pain, guilt and sadness that has come with it too.<br /><br />The movie was beautifully done and you get to see and experience a movie that I believe will definitely last the test of time as one of the great ones!<br /><br />*I received a copy of this for review - all opinions are my own*
B0068RHSCW|5.0|The movie kept my attention.  It had a rather unexpected ending.  Liked the movie very much and recommend it to others.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Love the challenge. 3 checkpoints along the way to practice. Still haven't gotten all the way to the end, but it's addicting and very fun to play. Be sure to be careful with it as internals are small and large jolts could cause issues. It's more of a &#34;fragile&#34; toy than a rough play kind of toy.
B00A1U2SVS|4.0|This album is really great, the sound quality is outstanding, there is just enough crowd noise to let you know it's a live album but without being distracting, and Robert Plant's vocals are as spot on as I have heard them in years (decades even).  Jason fills his dad's shoes admirably and Jimmy...Jimmy is still Jimmy without a doubt.<br /><br />My only complaint, and why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is that I didn't particularly care for the versions of my favorite 2 zep songs (1 of them being my all time favorite song): Kashmir was performed without a string section - JPJ's keyboards were a stand in, and they increased the mix on Jimmy's guitar to make up for it as well.  With the cash these guys have, they should have had the entire London Symphony Orchestra sit in if just for this 1 song.  I also didn't like how Jimmy's guitar had too much 'fuzz' on it for the beginning of Stairway.  In my opinion that takes away from the transition towards the end of the song.<br /><br />Overall though, this is a spectacular live album and I think I'll be buying the concert on Blu-ray.
0525478817|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars is truly a brilliant novel. As a teen, I have read many other books consisting vampires, werewolves, angles, and other fictional ideas. I was starting to get annoyed and frustrated at the fact that almost every teen book you pick up has some sort of magical story hidden within.<br /><br />In the 5 hour journey of reading the Fault in Our Stars, I was laughing hysterically, incredibly confused, and, most of all, crying my heart out. John Green has a way of ripping your heart out and placing it back in the wrong way. I fell in love with all the characters immediately.<br /><br />Despite your age, go on this incredible journey with Hazel, Augustus, Isaac, and experience something that will possibly change your life.<br /><br />I don't really know what else to say. My thoughts are stars I can't fathom into constellations. ;)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great app. Best calculator out there. The best price for any calculator out there. Highly recommend this app to anyone looking for a easy to use simple calculator.
B00ARA4SLU|5.0|I have been a fan of Alfred Hitchcock for some time and though some critics did not seem to like this I have to say that I was very impressed with not only the performances of Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirren, but of all of the actors. I was transfixed at how well Hopkins transformed himself into the well-known director and Mirren played an amazing Alma too. You can tell that Hopkins immersed himself in the character that he was portraying (as he does for most of his roles that I have seen him in in the past).<br /><br />On top of the great acting though I was also impressed with the overall writing of the movie itself. As a Psycho fan, I did not know the back story to the movie itself and as a viewer you completely get drawn in by the drama of the investment that Hitchcock makes to directing this film and ultimately as we all know, this movie becomes one of his biggest accomplishments!<br /><br />I also loved how this movie was set up as a typical Hitchcock television show with Hitchcock introducing and concluding the film. This was a nice touch and seemed appropriate, especially with the overall movie tone.<br /><br />I have to say that I would highly recommend all to see this, especially if you are a Hitchcock fan, as this is one that you will not soon forget!<br /><br />*I received a copy for review - all opinions are my own*
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|If you like Tom Selleck you must get the Jesse Stone Series.  I have told other people about them and they have throughly enjoyed them too.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|One of those books you start to read and you just can't put it down.  Wonderful love story.  Good read.........
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Another sterling production from Julian Fellows.  I have both seasons 1 and 2.  First - fantastic, second - still better than anything else on TV, but a little choppy.  Season 3 - redeemed my faith in the Brits.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|The point of the game is to make sure the balloons don't get to the end it is hard to begin but just keep playing. How to place drag tower you want then put it on the screen remember certain towers have certain specifications. Remember don't rate this on the controls or if it won't download it is a silly funny game or any other game out there.
0307474259|4.0|Do you believe that over eating causes obesity? If you do this will definitely be a great book because that really is a myth. Our bodies are much more complex than that.<br /><br />Gary Taubes strives to explain how the last fifty years of nutritional science while well intentioned is misguided. He attempts to explain in plain language why some people are fat and others are thin through exercise, genetics and food. Overall I think he does a good job there are some places where he does not quite connect the dots and to be fair cellular biology is complicated and the information is tedious at best.<br /><br />What I liked about this book is that he did not outright plug a diet which is great in the land of dieting books. He works hard to keep it about nutrition and how the body deals with fat. In many ways weather intentional or not he is leading people towards the palio diet. I thought he presented the information about insulin over production quite well. In short the western diet is full of carbohydrates and this is significantly higher than what our ancestors ate. Since our DNA has not yet caught up to our new way of eating our bodies get confused and we start to develop an imbalance which triggers other health issues like weight gain, diabetes, heart disease, etc.<br /><br />The book is an easy read and not very preachy. He tires to stay objective and manages to do so without being preachy or over confident. Instead I think he gives you a series of facts and lets you choose.<br /><br />If you are interested in the palio diet I highly suggest you start with [[ASIN:1594774137 Primal Body, Primal Mind: Beyond the Paleo Diet for Total Health and a Longer Life]]
B0076DELIG|5.0|Another winner!  Good fast read!  Michael Connelly sure knows how to weave intrigue, solid characterizations and excitement!  Try it, you'll not be disappointed!
B005LAIH2W|4.0|Extreemly entertaining. These are my husbands words.  I haven't had the pleasure yet of viewing this movie but am looking forward to seeing it.
B0013UIUBC|3.0|Found this movie to be cute but the plot not real strong.  Acting is good but Catherine Zeta-jones' character is a little overboard with her cranky, over-bearing attitude.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|this is a great app and I use it alot. nice to know the weather for 10 days out if necessary.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My wife and I are hooked on it! Very interesting soap opera with beautiful photography. The casting for this show was excellent.
0345803485|1.0|Guess I got it because others were talking about it. Did not get any of the others and thought it was a bit much. Seemed to go on and on with the same stupid things. Hope this does not go on in real life but like everything else now days guess it does.
B00687PWQG|5.0|Very close to actual history.  I like the true traditational setting of the home and the true time period of the atmostphere. Enyoyed watching it.
B005LAIHPE|3.0|The idea that the main character went from jail to being a Lt. in the U.S, Navy was far fetched. Also the idea of using a 3rd class radioman as part of a search and rescue operation was far fetched.  But other than that the movie was really good.
B0012FHGCW|3.0|Good movie if you like films that make you think real hard about life and it's meaning - you will be somewhat challenged to follow the main character's unusual lifestyle and thoughts.
B00846F1YW|3.0|pretty good.i like the story but it  ccould be faster. not need for the price. cheap entertainment. hope criminal case is available on kindle soon!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a great series and worth watching.  The costumes and scenes are very realistic.  Great job all the way around!
0470932139|5.0|I found this to be the best food photography book of the several that I have bought so far. It is well written and organized. It covers lots of good information and is quite thorough. I would highly recommend it.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I love Bruno Mars' music. He can hit you with a wonderful fast beat on one song and then he can sing to your soul with one of his slow ballads. You know how most CDs have those filler songs you just skip over to get to a good song? Bet ya don't skip any of these
B00004TS0E|5.0|For as long as I can remember I have loved this movie.  I saw it as a child and it gave me hope.  It can still have that affect on a child to this day.
B007NESBK2|5.0|Great video and audio quality which only enhanced a great performance. Would love to see Sade live but she doesn't tour very often and even less in the US. I'll take what I can get! Well worth the $$
B0076DCT2G|2.0|Too long and laborious could have been tighter, had difficult time getting thru it. Really enjoyed previous John Corey books, but this one was a disappointment. Characters not as spirited as in previous books. But I am still a fan of DeMille.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|I was a bit worried since it was subtitles but you get so drawn into the character development that you forget your reading.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is awsome and i think that evry one should play temple run 2<br />i think that they should come out with temple run 3 soon
B0042P2VLU|5.0|i WATCHED THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND NEVER GOT TIRED OF IT. LOVED THE TUBBY KITTY AND WAS OH SO SAD ABOUT THE DUCK. SUCH EMOTION IN ALL THE CHARACTERS.
B0018GRAE4|4.0|This LP by Five Finger is a bit more polished sounding then their other stuff. I love it. It has some great &#34;BalladType&#34; songs on it . The guitar kicks as well as the drummer. Everyone knows how great the singer is!!
1401235417|5.0|I couldn't think of a better way to kick off the 52 than this! The artwork is Frank Miller-esque and the story is top notch. It's a great way to introduce a new villain that will fit in perfectly to Batman's Rogue's Gallery: Another great enemy that is a twisted mirror image of the Dark Knight just like his others. One of the better stories I've read in awhile, and definitely something to get one excited for the stories after it. A definite can't miss that won't disapoint.
B008FRJ1IW|5.0|Finally! A Lego pack with Thor that doesn't require the purchase of a $50+ kit. Thor is a beast and a great addition to my collection.
030788743X|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It was hard to put down and great for the middle aged sci fi buff.  Thanks to Earnest Cline for writing it and I hope he writes something within the same alternate world again.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|It was typical Nicolas Sparks, with an actual happier ending.  Kind of stereotypical on the characters though, but I still enjoyed it start to finish.
B004EYRIBC|4.0|I was generally very happy about this. It contains a lot of music I haven't been able to get with previous soundtracks and I love all of the medleys that almost walk you through the entire trilogy. The one glaring flaw is that it doesn't have the original Ewok celebration ending for Return of the Jedi. It only has the new one, which is TERRIBLE. I really wish they had included that song.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is by far the best keyboard on the market right now. Easy to use and since it learns from what you type it gets better with time. I also use 3 different languages and combine them with English.  SwiftKey has integrated them seamlessly and predicts when I'm going to use them.  It did take some getting use to be able to use the flow feature but now it's faster than typing the words out.  I love this app and would never go back to using original keyboard.  I also use this app on my tablet and find it easier to use than SwiftKey on my phone.  I would definitely recommend getting this application for anyone interested. If you have any questions or doubts I would suggest getting the trial version
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|So well done!  Love it!, costumes fabulous, actors superb.  I wish the next season would get here already, loving the historical aspect.
B003730LRY|5.0|love it, love it, very funny and it is for the whole family, it is one one movie that you can see it with your family.
B001I45UFC|5.0|This is a very interesting book. I recommend it and think it is very clean.(besides a little blood) 👍😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃 :)
B001UTW7QU|5.0|A friend of mine recommended this to me a few months back and I finally started on it a few weeks ago.  It reminds me a lot of the X-Files but with a little grittier take.  Solid acting all around with a great cast.
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|I saw this film in the theater not expecting to love it as much as I did. It can be compared to Disney's &#34;Prep & Landing,&#34; but they are different. This has that wonderful British humor that I love and the story is heartwarming. It is a new Christmas must for our family.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|A great read! I couldn't put it down! Love the supernatural element and of course the love story. I recommend this to everyone!
B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|For the price, it was a great read. Interesting to have a dog as the protagonist. No dialogue outside of cursory characters. Very interesting.
B004ZGI2KK|5.0|i am a big fan of this item was so glad to get it, and it was everything i hoped it would be
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I have become hooked on Downton Abbey.  I love all the characters, the countryside, the home, and have watched each episode several times.
B007N8RULO|2.0|The app on my kindle was running poorly- quite clunky and slow. I would normally tolerate it , then not really notice, except I hated that the menu tray at the bottom wouldn't stay open, and I had to tap it every time I needed to undo.
0062101897|5.0|I gave this book as a gift, and it was a hit! If you have a person in your life or you are just someone who loves the Harry Potter film franchise, then this book is an awesome, detailed history of the making of the films.
B007L5GDGW|1.0|You turn it to make the marble move and by the time it starts to move and you try moving it the opposite way, it is too late and falls off the edges.
B008OOYALE|3.0|Ok game.  Not as good as dragonvale though.  Please add UCLATHEBEST.  I will send you gold and accept your mystic map requests if you send me gold.
B00865P3AS|3.0|If you are looking for just Cello only you have the wrong cd, Pick up the cd Cello for relaxation
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Its really engrossing. His details about the workings of the law are great. He keeps you into the story. Each chapter draws you in.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Fantastic series!  I am totally hooked and can't wait for the next season.  The story and the acting are excellent.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I like most of the Batman series.<br />This was exciting and well produced.<br />The action was Killer!<br />It kept me on my toes.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The first two episodes were difficult to get through, but if you make it to the 3rd episode, you'll be hooked.  Love it.  Got friends at work hooked on it, as well.
B009XHAM8G|5.0|This is one of my favorite books. Though only problem is I can still hardly make it through reading the book to my kids without tearing up!
B006QPX7UI|5.0|Great movie of all times.  It made me go Gettysburg and see where all of the battles took place.  I felt like I was back in time
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|This movie was great until the plot stopped for a rest at the farm. It became a lot quieter, a lot duller. One thing: none of the women characters were anything other than types (hooker, loving wife, fiercely protective mother) and the director/writer did not write them with the same complexity he wrote the male characters. Still, it was a good movie with some great moments.
B000005B0U|5.0|I love the Blues Brothers and having the sound track was a great buy for me. The CD came with no problems and works like a charm.
B007W1BLN0|4.0|It was well written and acted.<br />It was a thought provoking story, probably because it was based on true events.
0765325950|2.0|This book was chore to read. Much too wordily, a third could be eliminated without spoiling the plot line. Sanderson made sure he covered every minor character that made a appearance in all thirteen previous books. Of course you were not left wondering what happen too whom.  Avienda return to Rhuidean was not reverent to the plot line and amounted to nothingness. It seemed that all Sanderson was trying to do was to add pages to the book. The ping pong affect of rapidly jumping from one character to another  was over welling.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Greatest show going. A must watch. Fans of the original comic books will enjoy as much as someone who is just learning about the series of characters.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I loved it so much more than one million dollars it was so go go good I love the book :) :) :) :) :) :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the coolest game I ever played so for [[ASIN:B009UX2YAC Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition)]] dose anybody else like this game
B008IBPMZG|5.0|After staying up nights for nearly a week to watch season 2, I was not disappointed at all.  This is the best series I have ever watched.  I was transported to another place and time and actually vicariously experienced the joys and the tragedies of the characters.
B005CA4SJW|5.0|Not sure why this was done, however when the PLAY ALL option is selected the episodes ARE in fact edited. When each episode is selected individually the episodes are NOT edited. I do not know why this was done as I feel it takes away from the season 1 release...Aside from that it is still a fantastic series and a decent release.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Everyone thinks this series is all about the erotic scenes but if you really read it, you will see its about much more. Well written, great story, will read again.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|A great story and great casting.....<br />This movie was worth it.. i recommend it to any one. .......... ....  ....
B00127RAJY|5.0|If you are a Jillian Micheals fan you will love this! in only a half hour you will be sweating from every pore of your body and feel like you just worked out for a solid hour. she offers 3 seperate 30 min workouts which get harder so you don't get bored.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|As in any 'historical&#34; Hollywood film, one must be aware of how history is twisted.  After viewing the film I did my own research on the topic and found out the film really short-changed our friend to the north.  Of course, quite a bit of drama is added in the end to give the film that Hollywood excitement.  Anyway, the actors do a fine job in a very entertaining story with good production quality.
B004FHCH9Q|5.0|A thriller with some serious twists. The plot runs backward! The lead character can't create long term memories and your mind has to reassemble the movie in forward chronology
B0084670FU|3.0|Not sure why they have that on the cover, because Brad Pitt is hardly in the movie.  It's an interesting plot, but I thought the movie was slow moving.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Initially, In had no interest in reading any of this series. After much cajoiling from friends, I decided to give it a whirl. I was pleasantly surprised to find a well written love story with erotic, very erotic, scenes. I started this one on a weeknight and couldn't put it down. I was done and buying book 2 on my kindle by the next evening!!! It really captures your interest and keeps you wanting more, wondering what will happen next. I will be reading this whole series over again!!!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This is a fast reading book. The subject was interesting - it was what I had expected. Just what it was advertised to be
B008JGSM6G|3.0|I have enjoyed this app very much, but after awhile you catch on to the pattern and the fun is over
B00498YZH8|5.0|What a dark, emotional and disturbing movie...but one that has to be seen!  It's dificult to to put thoughts to the lives and the poverty shown in this movie, but the actors (everyone of them) and the locations created an &#34;In Your Face&#34; slam dunk portrayal of this very violent existance.  Wow,  Now I Know Why Jennifer Lawrence Is Receiving All the Accolades she is getting.
B004WGIXX4|3.0|The lead actors are nice eye candy and carry the rather simplistic and predictable storyline easily. Never really established why she has such a chip on her shoulder about relationships, and doesn't look fried after working grueling hospital shifts, or why he falls in love with her first.  Overall a good and fun film, with a few quirky charming elements too.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|The book has a great plot, but overall the ending was disappointing.  Wouldn't recommend it.  Great characters, but not a feel good read.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|picks up right where book 2 left off. Again, I love the story and the characters. Well written book with steamy erotic scenes but eroticism aside, this is a great series about screwed up people (like most of us) that go through a lot to be together and make a life.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I thought this was an excellent story. The author did a great job of executing the story. I can pretty much get into any story so long as it is expertly written and she did her job on that. Also a very suspenseful ending... I loved it.
B005CRQ4OW|4.0|5 star book no matter what anyone says. Best book I ever read.<br /> Very entertaining. I will always remember this book.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|This is a touching parable of how we think about and treat time, which is generally to disregard what precious time we have and focus on other things. The early part of the story lacks focus and purpose, and doesn't add that much to the overall parable. A much shorter intro of Dor to set the stage for his interaction with others in NYC would have sufficed.<br /><br />It is a quick read with a good message, so if you are at the airport and looking for something to read on your flight, pick up a copy, read it and then leave it on the seat for the next person to come along and enjoy.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Really fun game to play because you get a wide variety of blocks to use. You get to mine for iron, gold, and diamond. You can also build the nether mortal and go to the nether.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I love Mumford and Sons. I bought this cd only knowing maybe 1 or 2 songs. The whole cd is fantastic!!!!
B00BHMETKC|4.0|A good biographical movie that conveyed the unrest of the time.  Would have liked to see it touch a little more on the other embassy staff being held by the Iranians.
0061122416|4.0|When I was assigned to read this book I was not thrilled about having to actually go over it. I was very intrigued with this book and actually was able to finish it on my own.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|The book was more fun than watching the movie. We love reading these at bedtime for a laugh or two.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|The first and second book were better by far. In this one, Katniss goes mad, Peeta is delusional, Cinna dies, Prim dies, even Finnick dies. The book is just plain depressing. 👎
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Had no real expectations about this since I hadn't heard of it until seeing it in Amazon.<br /><br />Good fighting and dialog. This is one series besides Spartacus I intend to buy.
B009EBLCK8|5.0|The first season was awesome and after seeing the second season.....EVEN BETTER!!!  It is a must see if you love Sherlock Holmes!
B0086700CM|5.0|Best. Game. Ever. Just so you know, my high score is 5,000,000 something. My username is NebulousSimpleJoke. GET THIS APP!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this app/game. there is a lot more fun added. I hope every one else too. get this app
B0054SMID0|5.0|I enjoyed watching the Lincoln Lawyer.  The plot was well conceived and the acting was spot on.  Give it a try.
B005MMYBXI|5.0|Gods of the Arena is the prequil to Blood & Sand.<br /><br />Very adult oriented. This is like soft-porn Gladiator themed with really good storyline. The villains generate hate in the viewer.<br /><br />I own all these seasons. If you love gladiator themed stuff, this is a must-have!<br /><br />(its a far cry from Kirk Douglas gladiator stuff!!! this is much more...visceral)
B008NW67E0|5.0|This cd isnt as good as Sigh No More, but it is still great!  I love Mumford and Sons! BUY IT
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its cool its fun I like how you have to buy horses an earn money ................ . . . . .. . . . . .  . . . . . . .
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was a fantastic book and it's one that I could definitely read again. I also really enjoyed the movie.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Well done. Continuity of characters and character sets a high mark for other productions to follow.  We come to admire Lord Grantham and appreciate the difficulties and responsibilities of being titled but unfunded.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|Awesome app, enables you to download youtube videos and gives you a few options for size of file and the like.<br /><br />My only gripe with this app is sometimes it hangs up and stalls your tablet. Only thing that fixes this problem is going into dalvik cache once in a while and wiping. Do that and you are good to go for a bit.
B009BJAPLK|5.0|GREAT modern day Sherlock Holmes!!!! Highly recommend watching this if your a Sherlock fan! I wasn't sure at first then it had me after the first episode!
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|OMG, the hobbit is the most coolest movie since harry potter and The Lord of the rings. I've seen the hobbit more than once in theaters and will be seeing it again before it comes out on Tuesday march 19th. I strongly in courage u to see it in theaters and buy it on Blu ray combo ,as well as on iTunes and amazon instant video.
0425263916|5.0|You can read myfull review at Bec's Book Blog and see pictures of who I think would be perfect to play Gideon Cross if this book series were to be made into a movie!<br /><br />After reading everywhere online that the Bared to You: A Crossfire Novel is definitely the next book to read after Fifty, I had to get it.  This is the first book in the Crossfire series by Sylvia Day and it is fantastic!  I think I might like Gideon Cross and his stalker qualities even better than Christian Grey!  He's a hot, possessive, billionaire CEO!<br /><br />The second book is called Reflected in You: A Crossfire Novel.  I read it a few days later and the story picks up right where it left off.  It goes deeper into the relationship between Eva and Gideon and is just as fascinating and a fun read.  It had all the angst and passion that made me not want to be interrupted at all while I was reading it which was great because my husband was working afternoons/nights so I had plenty of time to get sucked into the world of Upper Class New York City.
B000007492|5.0|purchased for my husband and he LOVES it...a perfect gift for Valentines day...he was thrilled with the surprise and download on his ipod
B005IQZB14|3.0|This book is  somewhat interesting, I read it for a Book Club I am in.  I would never have read this book otherwise.  I did enjoy parts of it, but I found I did not relate to or care too much about the main character.  She made some bad judgements in her life, but seemed to end up OK.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Hubby wanted this for his April birthday.  He's already opened it and viewed it over several weekends.  The king is happy and can't wait for season 3!
B0017I1IZA|5.0|Love the read - we discuss who we would cast as characters!  Light easy read that we both enjoy immensely.
1476715904|5.0|This book Slammed by Colleen Hoover was amazing.  The story really grabbed me and I ended up reading it on a Saturday afternoon (which turned into evening) because they were so addicting.  Around luchtime on a beautiful summers day in January (Australia) I went to sit out in the alfresco area to read for an hour or two.  Well that turned into about 9 hours (I read the second book that day as well!) and it was dark before I could concentrate on anything else!  I vaguely remember cooking something simple for dinner.  My poor dog Charlie didn't get a walk that day!<br /><br />I had never heard of Slamming before but it is definitely a unique angle for a book!<br /><br />You can see who I've chosen to play Will Cooper at my Bec's Book Blog if this series was ever made into a movie!
B00AYF5SHQ|5.0|As one other reviewer notes, Julia Fischer's new concerto album is balanced more naturally than usual, with the violin heard in the context of the orchestra rather than standing in the limelight larger than life.  There are many moments, especially in the Dvorak, where the soloist sensitively blends into the instrumental textures as if one voice among several, and this isn't just a matter of blended sound - Fischer phrases in a nuanced way with the music that envelops her.<br /><br />Fischer gets away with such restraint and even reticence thanks to the way her musicality captures the listener's attention. Her tone is glowing and ardent, totally devoid of the usual virtuoso tactic of throwing every note across the footlights. Her phrasing always \\"speaks,\\" too, which adds to the sense of a personal voice. Zinman rises to his best as well, as an involved equal partner.  I'm by no means a fan of his, but he deserves to be appreciated here. The engineering is clear and detailed, and the violin's tone is sweet and natural. I agree with a previous comment that the Adagio of the Dvorak is a high point, but the fairly measured pacing of the finale is also very effective in a movement that can seem too lightweight.<br /><br />As for the Bruch, it benefits from everything already mentioned, including Fischer's ability to play precisely but with a relaxed delivery.  I rarely listen to recordings for the \\"total package,\\" but in terms of technique, expression, recorded sound, depth, and intensity, this is a Bruch concerto without flaws in any department.  My only quibble is that Fischer's restraint isn't quite as effective as in the Dvorak - the Bruch concerto is built on a bigger scale, although both share a special warmth and lyrical beauty. Still, anyone who has heard enough Bruch concertos to last a lifetime shouldn't pass up this one; the piece has never sounded less like a warhorse, or more personal (with a few exceptions, like the classic Menuhin recording on EMI).
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love this book it is the hunger games ever I love the movie to but the books are way better
B0082Z1CVQ|4.0|How do you rate a classic either you love them or you don't.  I thought this one was pretty Good.
0061780308|5.0|Probably one of the best written books I've read (heard) in a very long time. It's remarkable how the author can narrate a convincing story through the eyes of a dog. Splended..

B004K8WPUQ|1.0|I put this on a Canon T4i and the hiss or what ever you call it make it unusable. I bet a $10 junk microphone sounds better than this.<br /><br />No matter what setting I use the hiss is so bad when things get quite that I can't use it. I hope it's not too late to return it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game it is the best game ever. Just love it so much. I think this is the best game ever.
B008K6HN8I|3.0|I use this on my Kindle to read many types of files and usually it does work as an acceptable file manager.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|What I have always known written by an authoritative source! Thank you! I couldn't put this book down. I was moved indescribably!
B007C7UZIG|5.0|Recommended by a friend I have enjoyed hours of gaming through steam. I would recommend it to anyone that games through the PC...they have great prices daily.
B0097GVJWQ|3.0|fun hog with puzzles that aren't ridiculously hard...unfortunately the finale is unplayable on the kindle fire.  bigfish support has been aware of the bug for months but has not done a fix.  left a bad taste in my mouth...will be reluctant to purchase another bigfish app until they improve their QA.  too bad because it is a decent game.
B004UPANGM|2.0|This movie is not very well written, it is not filmed very well, and is truly a waste of viewing time.
B009FZFONO|3.0|a vert slow one. not the greatest by far. this just seems to be used to set you up for what might happen.
0385344228|4.0|I would recommend this book to those who let themselves fall into the plot designed by the author, however do not recommend this book for those who like to nitpick about legal matters (if you're the type of person who says, \\"the book was much better than the movie/ the movie was hardly a variation of the novel\\", then move on to another book).<br />For the rest if you, this book will open up questions of morality and the strength or weaknesses of the U.S. legal system. Is Jacob guilty? Innocent? Despite the overwhelming evidence against him, Jacob's father, the protagonist, takes on a role where he is torn between his expertise as a prosecution lawyer and a father. The end will certainly surprise all readers.<br />The one complaint I have, which other reviewers mentioned, is the lack of character development, and the exaggeration of the way teenagers talk. That was a little irritating, but fortunately those scenes ended relatively quickly.
B0012FHGCW|4.0|Tour de force by a very naive but idealistic adolescent. Good shots and scenery, anachronism tells the story in a compelling manner.
B00A4YVHXQ|2.0|This is play a lot like Guitar Hero, but on your phone or tablet. It's impossible on your phone, as sometimes you have to hit 3 keys, just like on a real piano. Sorry, but fat fingers on a small mobile screen just doesn't cut it. I'm not sure if it plays better on a tablet, but it goes very fast and even the &#34;easy&#34; songs are hard to follow. Don't recommend for mobile users.
B001P1MZNI|5.0|From the Intro to the close, it's pleasure all the way. Never saw Frank live, nor did I have the pleasure of seeing Count Basie live, but this album, together with a glass of scotch and dim lights lets me close my eyes and imagine what it would have been like to have been there for this show.<br /><br />These days my taste runs more to Jazz and Blues but I've always had a soft spot for a real crooner backed by a big band. This album captures both with arguably the best crooner and best big band at the time. I bought it as a MP3 download while it was on  special, and while I'd like to say I would have paid full price, the truth is I wouldn't.<br /><br />If anything, this is the perfect example of why Amazon needs to include more vintage albums when they have their &#34;100 albums at $2.99 or less&#34; specials.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This is not just the best scifi I have ever seen, but one of the best shows I have ever seen. I love the characters and the dialogue and the story line is awesome. I am so sad there is only one season! I love Mal!
B006LSZECO|4.0|My book club enjoyed it and recommended it. There was a lot of discussion about the ending and what would happen to the charecters.
B0001JXQEM|4.0|5 stars to the artist and album, ALWAYS LOVED WEEZER<br /><br />4 stars because the cd case was a little beat up in a corner but other than that im satisfied.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Totally awesome the for letting me have  this awesome book was absolutely nothing more likely that the Oregon and so much is there a way of doing this awesome book was absolutely nothing more to be the Oregon trail jobs in a little sister and her everyday life as a little sister and I love it when I love this book was absolutely nothing but the proposal for me have a canopy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Well subway surfers is a great game. I absolutely love the new Easter egg hunt and the policemen dressed up as a bunny. He's so fat it makes me laugh. I would rate subway surfers a 5star review and I thing everyone who has ever a Apple of any sort of a kindle fire should have this game<br /><br />  5 star rated absolutely!!!!
0307744434|4.0|The novel is about a magicians' duel, and their venue is a specially designed circus that is only open after dark. The circus's unwitting patrons are there to be entertained, and the magicians are trying to astound them through greater displays of magic. The fun part is that the novel is set in the late-nineteenth-century in a world in which no one believes in magic. While the magicians perform amazing feats of real magic, the patrons chalk it up to \\"circus magic.\\"<br /><br />The novel is also a romance. \\"Spell-binding\\" love is one of those magical realities that the magicians end up dealing with. It's a night circus. Magical things happen at night. At night doves appear out of thin air and people disappear without a trace. At night love also blooms and grows.<br /><br />Morgenstern attempts to give the whole book a certain dreamlike quality by narrating in the present tense (which I found a bit distracting at first, but I got over it). The book is also sprinkled with occasional vignettes written in the second person. I know these passages were meant to reinforce the dreamlike quality, but I don't think they were wholly successful. Second-person narrative seems pretentious and awkward. It reminds me a bit of those choose-your-own-adventure books that I read in middle school. I'm forgiving the book for this minor lapse because it still delighted me.<br /><br />I won't say that this book was deep or important, but it does have magic and whimsey. The book tries to convince the reader that this is a magical world but too few of us notice. The night circus is a microcosm of the world. Most of us wander through life being awed by it, but never understanding just how magical a place it is. The circus has a purpose that only tangentially involves its guests, and our world has meaning too. Moreover, we tell stories everyday, but we don't notice the master narrative of life. This novel deals with all these ideas: life is a story set in a magical world and has a purpose. And the novel's about love. Who doesn't like a love story?<br /><br />Portions of this review previously appeared on my website.he novel's about love.
