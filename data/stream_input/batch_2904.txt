B0064MPXFA|4.0|the cast is phenomenal. The actors fit the roles perfectly, and the story line is solid and enacted without loosing focus.
B00BOUL9DM|5.0|I found my wife and son playing this game all the time. After one try, I was captivated as well. It makes you think very sharply at the same time that you learn new words.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|It is what I want. I bought it for my friend and my friend say that is very very good.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|I wasn't impressed, From the trailer it looked like good story but I was a bit disappointed. Kinda boring and dull.
1451696191|4.0|She fell in love with the movie and had to have the book. She loved it more and this was a great deal.
B005544TRQ|5.0|What a great show.  Had picked up this show mid-season 2 - was able to catch up.  Gotta love it!!
B009NFHF0Q|1.0|I just didn't get it!  This was the first book that I've read by this author. . .and I doubt that there will be a second. Is there some deep &#34; hidden meaning&#34; that I missed amongst the flapping fabric and pulling a worm from ones leg???
B0091LS07E|3.0|some good songs, however, just not enough on the album to make it really sizzle!!<br /><br />Look the songs that are good on this album are very good, Just not enough to say I really love this cd, know what I  mean?
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Awesome book.  I think Rothfuss has a good career ahead of himself.  The followup book is just as good and I can't wait for the third.
B00EQRMAJW|5.0|John Legend is brilliant on this CD. Love the subject matter and vocals.  He switches things up and this one is sure to be a classic!
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|Rented movie with no expectations and was pleasantly surprised.  Implausible shooting scenes aside it's a great late night or rainy day distraction.
B001P06GX4|4.0|It's a light and fun brain workout.<br /><br />If you like Tetris ... you'l like this.  I've heard that Gemblo is a better version of this game.<br /><br />I havent played it yet to compare.  I dont think I'll buy Gemblo but that is only since we have Blokus already.  If I get a chance to play Gemblo and it's better game, I might sell this one.<br /><br />It's a good game!  We play it now and again.  Replay with the same people over and over...it's okay if they are learning from past mistakes.  If it's just you and the kids  it's the same game over and over.  If you play different people who can come up with different strategies the replay goes way up.  Two players is way to easy... four players if FUN!<br /><br />The Components are good.  The box is your average game box. The box stores everything nicely and has a components trays which I like. The pieces themselves fit beautifully in into the game slots and are nicely made.<br /><br />The art / graphics are good.<br /><br />The FUN FACTOR it's all in the challenge and strategy and it does well.  It's a light and fun brain workout.
B00CE2G3AS|5.0|Great movie. Great transfer to blue-ray. Wonderful story. I like movie and &#34;Footloose&#34;. They are like companion movies. It has a great story and good music too.
B004U52VPS|3.0|It is staying on our shelves more as a Toy/Game then a Game.<br /><br />My youngest son received this as a gift, since he was so into electronic version.<br /><br />We've played it as a game a few times. He decided he wanted to combine it with our Kepla/Keva/Citiblocs collection. It's great fun to build with the blocks then shoot it down with the slingshot and angry birds. Since then the Angry Birds Game is that is stored in our Big Tube of blocks. They haven't played the game again as the \\"game\\"<br /><br />For those who don't know Kepla blocks are thin strips of wood that are about 3\\" long about 1\\" wide. They are without print providing a blank canvas to build whatever they can imagine.  The kids play with them several times a week now, in the beginning they didnt play with them that much.  After watching a few videos on YouTube of adults playing with them they took off.<br /><br />Back to the Game it's self.<br /><br />The FUN Factor well it is fun as a game. It's knocking stuff down my little meeples love that. Kids can learn a lot about physics in the building of structures and from the demolishing arc of the angry birds.<br /><br />Replay... as the way it was intended to be played I don't know it's morphed into it's own game/toy our home. Few times has it followed the rules with only the pieces included. So, I am honestly not sure. I think that the replay value would have been limited if it had not morphed.<br /><br />Personally, I am just glad they use the pieces in such a free form way. I like that every time they play they make up their own rules/story for that session of play. I would strongly recommend buying some type of complimentary block set that can be played along side this.<br /><br />The Components themselves are a sturdy plastic. The angry birds fly nicely and are a lot of fun for the kids. The sling is holding up so far, which considering it's plastic moving parts I am pleasantly surprised. The cards are run of the mill mid grade cards.<br /><br/>The box is flimsy at best it was designed to be seen not restore. We cut out the graphics and used clear shipping tape to tape them on the Top/Ends/Sides of a Sterilite Clip Box. I like using the shallow version of the Sterilite Clip Boxes for stuff like this.<br /><br />The art and design on the box was average. The pieces are a well designed, visually fun and really they are what creates the 3D real life version of this electronic game for the kids.<br /><br />NOTE: I tried adding in some little angry birds that were not game pieces but smaller plastic/rubbery balls they did not come close to comparing to the sturdy weight/durability of the pieces that are included with the game.<br /><br />Overall. 4.8 (adding in credit for Toy/Game Play)
B0011ZNAIC|3.0|The Bee Movie Bowling for Movies Score - 111.375 of 300<br /><br />What is Bowling for Movies you might ask - it's a score that I, just your average dude, have come up with to rate and score movies.  I gotta lot time on my hands and I watch movies - many MANY movies.  Using the latest technology and a mixture of pseudo and quasi science, I have developed a formula (which literally has nothing to do with bowling) to capture the pure essence of Hollywood magic... displayed as a score ranging from 0 to 300.  A score of 108 would be a \\"just ok, not particularly good / bad\\" movie, where a score of 192 would tell you it was a very good movie.  Now, break 200 and you've got something really special.  Throw too many \\"gutterballs\\" will land you under 100 and well - you get the idea. :]<br /><br />The Bee Movie - We own the DVD<br /><br />Movie Explanation (no-there is too much, let me sum up):<br />The somewhat tired story of an insect (this time a bee) named Barry who can't seem to settle into the thought of his place in the hive.  Bees are expected to go to school, graduate college and then pick one job from a long list of possibilities to work for the rest of their lives.  As Barry goes about NOT choosing his job he comes into conflict with friends and family and finally ends up going out with the Pollen Jocks (the super elite pollen and nectar collecting bees) and runs amuck in New York.  After a near death experience at the bottom of a boot, Barry is saved by a woman named Vanessa.  A sort of friendship ensues which leads to the knowledge that evil food companies have been stealing honey from bees and Barry files a law suit (ya, I know... that was out of left field) and once he's won, the entire biosphere of the planet dies (you know, because the bees stopped working because they now had all this honey they needed and stop pollenating the plants of the world).  Blink blink.<br /><br />Ok, clearly this movie dude didn't care for the movie much... but this is a family project and I have to tell you Little Miss Movie dude LOVED this movie when she was 7 when it came out and STILL loves this movie today (and here I give a direct quote), \\"I can always depend on `The Bee Movie' and feel like I can watch it whenever - I love it!\\"  As a matter of fact, there were some heated words exchanged because of difference in opinion.  Silly I know, but it goes to show where the line in the sand for this movie is drawn.  As an adult and fan of Jerry Seinfeld and crew I expected a funnier movie... as a child, Little Miss Movie Dude loved the animation, the easy going story.  I found the erratic story changes disconcerting... she suggested I was over thinking it (she might be right, she's often wiser than her years).  So, to be fair and even handed, I thought I would do this review a little different than my normal Bowling for Movies reviews... I'll voice my issues and I'll list what she loved.  Honestly, at the time of this review the DVD cost about $5 and The Bee Movie is worth probably twice that (but that's about it).<br /><br />What Little Miss Movie Dude loved:<br />> What's not to like when Jerry Seinfeld is on board - he has a great wit and always brings `the funny'<br />> An interesting twist into the fantasy life of a thriving bee hive - the way they envisioned the hive city as being part theme park was really fun to watch - particularly, I liked the cars!<br />> The Bee Movie is a mellow good time that you really don't have to think too hard to watch... just sit back and enjoy<br />> The colors they used throughout the film made everything seem warm and inviting - like a sunset on a late summer day<br /><br />What Dad, The Movie Dude didn't like:<br />> Tired `bug' themed movie that relies on a misfit bug who ends up making a huge difference... we get it, I already saw Antz and Bugs Life to name a few (I mean changing an ant to a bee doesn't qualify as `new' in my book)<br />> The animation was generic for CGI based movies of the mid-2000's... other CGI movies out around the same time had a better defined artistic style<br />> The story is all over the place and seems like 3 (or more) separate `episodes' without a clear story arc running throughout - first a misfit bee, then strange, nearly romantic relationship, then in a court room, then the entire plant world is dead - oh ya, remember at the beginning when we said every bee is important???<br />> Over reaching and ultimately not well engineered - this movie is not likely to become a classic but takes its place with other Disney wanna-bees (get it?  wanna-bees, I couldn't resist)<br /><br />Hey, if you have a question about this review, feel free to leave a comment and I will try to answer promptly. I will be leaving more movie reviews with bowling scores so check out my other reviews.

B0013TTLDE|5.0|The House at Riverton is my third Kate Morton novel and my favorite.  That being said, I recommend all of her novels for a refreshing look at war-torn England and the emotional toll taken on people from all levels of society.
0307987647|5.0|Viewing the HBO Series game of thrones captured my interested in the books--they are much better. Why, because they provide the essential background and character development that makes the mini series so much better. The intrigue finally understandable and the choices made by the characters are supported by their musings not available in the miniseries. These books on tape make my commute to and from work almost a pleasure.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I will never get tired of this wonderful show. The time just flies by when I watch it. It draws me in to another time.
B00AVTMB4I|5.0|Eccentric. Odd story. Not what you expect.<br /><br />Comes together really well. Good feeling after movie ends. Imdb loves it too.
B0018RFLQ2|5.0|This is still a great movie 20 years later (it debuted in 1993). It's a wonderful slice of chess history, as well as a story of the joys and trials of parenting and trying to balance a child's abilities, interests, and activities. The father/son dynamic and the role other men can play in shaping a child's character should not be overlooked.
1250030951|5.0|Cath isn't exactly ready for college. She isn't even looking forward to much except the advanced level English class she talked her way into during registration.<br /><br />College itself is daunting enough. Then Cath's sister, Wren, announces that she doesn't want to be roommates on campus. Suddenly the entire prospect has gone from horrible to possibly unbearable.<br /><br />Cath's roommate is loud and scary. She's also kind of mean. And her boyfriend is around All. The. Time.<br /><br />The dining hall is too horrible to even contemplate.<br /><br />She's worried about her dad who is going to be living alone for the first time in years.<br /><br />And Cath doesn't know what to expect from her classes.<br /><br />In the midst of so much unwelcome change, Cath does have one constant: Simon and Baz.<br /><br />Cath, like most everyone, is a Simon Snow fan. She knows the community. She goes to the release parties. She also writes fan fiction about Simon and his nemesis Baz.<br /><br />The only problem is that Cath isn't sure fan fiction alone is going to be enough to get her through a turbulent freshman year in Fangirl (2013) by Rainbow Rowell.<br /><br />Fangirl is a meandering journey through Cath's first year of college as she adjusts to dorm life, college classes and even the nuances of dating and friend politics. (Not to mention all of her family drama.)<br /><br />Epigraphs accompany each chapter with relevant excerpts either from the Simon Snow books or from Cath's fan fic about the characters. The technique works surprisingly well as readers are drawn into the world of Simon Snow and come to care about him (and Baz) as much as Cath does.<br /><br />One of the best things about Fangirl is that all of the characters are very well developed. Although the novel focuses on Cath it feels like any of the characters could be the star here-they all have their own stories.<br /><br />Rowell's writing is as excellent as fans would expect. She also unpacks complicated topics such as the line between fan fiction and plagiarism. Cath is a strong, neurotic heroine who is far from perfect but also very, very real. Fangirl also summoned all sorts of nostalgia about the college experience and friendships.<br /><br />Because this book covers a large range of time some matters are addressed more than others; some things are tied up more than others. There are questions at the end of Fangirl but there is also enough room for readers to imagine their own endings.<br /><br />Possible Pairings: The Best Night of Your (Pathetic) Life by Tara Altebrando, Take Me There by Susane Colasanti, Graffiti Moon by Cath Crowley, The Moon and More by Sarah Dessen, Take a Bow by Elizabeth Eulberg, Just One Day by Gayle Forman, Thirteen Little Blue Envelopes by Maureen Johnson, Saving Francesca by Melina Marchetta, Wild Awake by Hilary T.

B0084AZXKK|5.0|Treasure Island has renewed my interest in reading the classics.  I read with great excitement and anticipation of the many adventures found in this story of pirates and treasure hunting.  Reading this novel also revived my childlike fascination with a great story.  I had it downloaded onto my Kindle and was very pleased with the quality and ease of reading from a screen rather than on paper.  I now am pursuing other classics of literature that meet my interest.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I really looked forward to this one. Something different, characters with varied strengths and weaknesses, which make you love them or hate them. Then once you really hate them you get a look at their softer side and end up kind of liking them. Good collection of characters and enough mystery involved to keep you engaged to the end and wanting to see the next episode. Glad they are back for season 3 too.
B004Q3UL2O|1.0|The chemistry between Jake and Anne hathaway is like watching a hyena and a giraffe trying to mate.  It is the most disparate coupling.  I felt no chemistry within these two very repellent characters with even worse terribly awkward interactions.  So this is what happens when you put two celebrities who may have been packaged to a project because on paper it looked appealing and money making.  Any additional negative words I have to say about this lame film would be more of the same.  I do like Jake, but he was just cast w the wrong actor.  I do believe Anne Hathaways is talented, but mostly miscast in this movie.  These two actors should have had a chemistry read to at least have some semblance of what could have been a very touching last quarter of a film when things start getting sappy.
B007N8RULO|4.0|I have only accomplished one suit at a time but I have managed to win 53 games in a row.  My last run I had only made it to 24 games in a row before but last night I won 53 games in a row.  Not to bad for an old lady.  Thanks for the games that keep me thinking.
B009NY3CL8|4.0|A Great movie! A good one for the entire family to enjoy together. Robin Williams was perfect in this role.
B0054U56B4|5.0|Great series! Love these books, I couldn't put the books down all the way until the end. If your a Twilight fan, this series is for you.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|CANNOT WAIT FOR CAPTIVATED BY YOU! Love these series you cannot put them down! Now what am I suppose to read until the next book?!
B00A8ECU24|1.0|This game is basically farmville... I loaded it for my 5 year old daugether, and luckly my one touch  was disabled because she almost spent $100.00 real dollars on pony crystals or something equally as dumb. Deleted the game right away.<br /><br />Thanks for nothing HASBRO.
B0069JBKHI|4.0|I bought this monitor, less than a year ago. First thing first, I am deaf and I have 2 small hearing children and a hearing husband. For my situation after reading all these reviews, I went ahead and bought this monitor after my 2nd child was born because after using all the \\"deaf technology\\" with my first child, it didn't help me when my children woke up from naps, in the mornings (my husband leaves early before we all are awake and I stay home with the kids) or hear my kids move around in the bedroom. I loved this monitor but after getting it through the glitches that comes with setting up anything new, it worked great, it is not perfect but it worked. I did have to plug it in and out(this part is what is broken) and it no longer plugs(the battery part/recharger) in anymore. I have been in touch with Withings, wrote a ticket over a week ago, been in touch with the IT person on FaceBook, but no avail to have anyone help me to answer any my questions AT ALL. You would think as expensive this product is, you'd have better customer service. I mean, I had to shell out every penny I had to buy this just to have a peace of mind while my kids were napping or in their room, rather than me checking on them every 15 mins which equals no peace of mind for mommy. I am just at the point now where I am frustrated about what to do to fix this monitor. I need this product fixed. If anyone has any suggestions/advice, it would be greatly appreciated! I have a hard time believing this product isn't supposed to last just a year. If that is the case, it is not worth it.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|can't believe I was soo against this book... brilliant story. I really liked the structure of the book breaking it down into interviews really made it easy reading.
B0000024IE|5.0|Got the album today, just came in! I'm a fan of public enemy and their music! Like their hit single fight the power. They speak the truth and that's what I like about old school rap.<br /><br />Public enemy slaps hard!
B00AWJMTXK|5.0|i know little about english literature, but to me this book is very unique in its general atmosphere, just like a fairy tale, our protagonists living in carelessly and freely.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love the interaction of all the characters and love to hate a few of them. Haha.  Didn't expect the turn of events in the season finale.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This is a great story, holds your interest throughout and is unpredictable. I had no idea what the \\"secret\\" was until it was revealed. The story revolves around 3 woman and their families. Each has their own personality and quirks, and end up being tied together in one way or another. I found some of their thoughts and actions rather humorous and relatable. There is a sadness to it as well. Lots of emotions are conveyed. Definitely recommend it!
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I LOVE THIS ALBUM!!!!!!! I go to sleep listening to it and I wake up doing the same! I'm so late!! Why didn't I buy this album when it first came out?? &#34;If I Knew&#34; is my FAVORITE song!!!!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book! Wish it would have continued, but a good thing it did so I can get back to the real world and get some things done besides reading a great book!
B000VIPJKM|5.0|Full of awesome one-liners.  Reese Witherspoon is awesome and Jennifer Coolidge almost stole the show.  Definitely fun to watch more than once.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My kids love this game, there are all sorts of horses to choose from.  Although I think an Arabian would be nice. And the graphics were better than expected. It's pretty easy to navigate as well.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The Fault In Our Stars by John Green. I would highly recommend this book to anyone around my age. This book was an immaculate read, from cover to cover. I was so impressed with John Green's genius plot thinking, motifs and the way he built each characters personality over the course of the book. The whole book was relatable through emotion. I gained this ability to feel almost the same way as the characters. It was almost as if I was looking though the main characters lenses. I found this deep relation between each character that made me think hard about my meaning to life. Hazel Grace Lancaster, the main character, is suffering from stage three thyroid cancer. She is not so much in it for the fight because of motivation, but simply because she has to be. She is surprisingly a laid back, low pressured character throughout the whole book, and doesn’t seem to dwell on that fact that she has cancer. Even though she does have cancer, the book seems to make readers focus on different events in the book. The cancer just seems to be, as Hazel puts it, “A side effect of dying.” The book contains many odd quotes that almost make you feel as if the author is playing with your brain. In a sense the book will be as good as readers want it to be. Through imagination, readers might think of profound explanations for each theme. Honestly, it was the opposite of cliché in that Hazel really told her story how it was. You live every day, but in the end your life just stops, without any warning, and mere expectance. When I finished this book, I kept on thinking about it. I had this emotional uprising in my heart that would constantly pound at me. I would ponder upon all the different things that had occurred. I dreaded the thought that any other book I picked up would ever meet the same feelings as this one. The reason why, struck me while I was writing this paper. I was feeling emotions identical to Hazel Grace! I was indeed the main character in this book. I know it sound like a stretch, but this is what John Green was trying to portray to his readers. That we are the main characters to every book because we are technically experiencing the events. We also are the ones who come up with conclusions and character identities. We basically write the book through our imagination, and become the main characters.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I highly recommend this book.
B0000844M8|5.0|This is the great movie that started the save the lions movement. It is enjoyable and warmly portrayed story of the rescue of a tiny Lion cub and its eventual reintroduction to the wild. Facts in real life were quite tragic however. The lioness Elsa later would return to the compound in poor shape- eventually succumbing to tick fever. Both of our heroes would be robbed and murdered. But why spoil things- Just enjoy the movie!
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This is for a course I have to take for work.  Got I quickly. Thank you I hope to enjoy it
B008XKSW7M|4.0|I had low expectations for it, only because when it was in theaters I heard it wasn't great. But I loved it. I could really relate to Elizabeth Banks' character, especially, but I enjoyed all the different story lines. It made me laugh out loud and caused me to shed a few tears, too. It's funny and honest about the joys of pregnancy, without being over the top. I liked that it covered so many different situations, and I think most parents could relate to at least one of the story lines. It seemed very down to earth and honest to me. And quite funny.
B000ID37RM|5.0|What a great movie.  It never gets old.  Lessons we need to learn. Wonderful acting/good reflection of book.  Can watch it several times a year.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Very well organized, thorough-easy-to-understand information that is also easy to manipulate for us of the 'older generation'. Thanks! We needed that!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|An exciting easy read...found myself reaching for it in the middle of the night when I'd wake up and read until I fell asleep again.  Read whenever I could....so good!
B00EB6F1TY|4.0|I just wish it wasn't in the letterboxed format, just got a new tv and I thought the wasted space was a waste. Oh well, still a pretty good movie in a universe I thoroughly enjoy.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|LOVED THIS FROM BEGINNING TO END. HAD READ SILENT WIFE BEFORE THIS ONE AND LOVED IT EVEN MORE!  DIDN'T WANT IT TO END!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I read the first two books in this series and loved them.  I like the author's writing style and the details are just enough without seeming like filler information.  I read the reviews for this book and waited awhile before purchasing it.  I am surprised that so many readers are upset about having 5 books instead of 3.  I read to enjoy the story and the more I can read the same story, the happier I am.  Having 5 books seems really nice because I can read the same story without having to learn the characters again.<br /><br />I did feel like this book was not my favorite in the series, but things did progress in this one.  I liked that Gideon actually was able to open up about his past a little more to Eva.  I also like how they end up together, but still have issues to work out.  This is more true to a real romance in life than just a fantasy.  I love that it is realistic in that sense.<br /><br />I really enjoyed continuing the same story and being able to escape from day to day things while reading.  It is always refreshing to be able to turn the world off around me.  Overall, it was a great read, and I look forward to the next one!
B000FCJZ3G|5.0|I was in debt of over $25,000.  After reading this book, I cleared my debt in a little over 2 years and finally began to save money.  I saved a substantial amount of money and started my own business.  I highly recommend this book for anyone who is ready to figure out why they aren't making the money they know the deserve. If you want to figure out why you are living paycheck then get this book. If you want to learn what's blocking you from being successful and wealthy, get this book.
B0052RDHTM|1.0|I had only read but a few chapters when I decided it wasn’t worth my time.  Buy a different book.
B004Q3SGWG|5.0|I read the short story of this movie and thought it was very inspiring. One of my friends had the movie on DVR and said it was very good. I rented it when I got home and I will have to agree that this is an incredible movie. It is not like a regular a movie that has a camera crew and is filming from a distance. A guy has a camcorder and is recording himself and what he is going thru. Not much action but a great story line and those are my favorite kind of movies. Incredible story of what the will to live really means!!!
B0089AD8IO|5.0|Before this, the last Doctor I saw was Tom Baker. Now I follow it again with more passion than when I was a kid.
B008RYN44U|5.0|Another awesome album from No Doubt. I listen to it over and over again! Its one of my go-to's in the car!
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I got this book for a schools project and did not think to much about it but then I found myself  reading it until 11 o'clock
1452126607|5.0|I love, love this calendar. All the pictures are cute and funny and the quality of the product is wonderful.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Orphan Train is a wonderful  look into the past, yet blends in current times. I always thought every kid deserved to know an adult cared about them and this book is a great example.
1452126577|4.0|Sometimes the same picture gets a bit old when it is rerun with a different caption over and over. Overall, it was a fun read, but the quips sometimes border on a bit too hateful.

B00915G6WQ|5.0|Dexter is one of the best shows ever put on television. Although a bit morbid, it's a great show. If you've never watched Dexter, i would suggest you start at season 1 and go from there. I am sad to see the show ending with season 8 but i will own all seasons once they're available.

B00992CF6W|5.0|I think with this app you should also get pocketinvpro it lets you cheat and is so fun you just build and if you run out of wood log out and cheat some in but minecraft alone is cool the only thing that I personally think it needs is adventure mode and Redstone I love Redstone I get that it would cause a lot of lag but still worth it for me.

B00ECUARO8|3.0|It had a good story line but took forever to tell the story.  The suspense was how long until the suspense would be over because it is killing me to get through with this movie.

006226303X|4.0|I listen to audio books back and forth in the car on the way to and from work. Usually I leave the discs in the car to be continued the next day. Not this time.<br /><br />Neil Gaiman himself is the reader on the audio version of his latest book, The Ocean at the End of the Lane. There is something magical about hearing an author perform their own work. And in this case - it truly was magical.<br /><br /> Our unnamed narrator returns to his childhood home for a funeral. He vaguely remembers a house at the end the lane and drives down to see if it is still there. When he arrives, he begins to remember bits and pieces.....especially eleven year old Lettie Hempstock, who befriended the then seven year old narrator. Lettie live with her mother and grandmother. Out back of the farmhouse is a pond - one Lettie used to call the ocean. And as our narrator wanders back to it, he remembers more....something dark was set loose that summer.<br /><br /> How to describe my thoughts? The book encompasses good and evil, friendship, love, loyalty, faith, fear, innocence lost, magic, adventures and of course monsters.....It's scary, sad, nostalgic, heartwarming, thoughtful....<br /><br /> Cautionary advice - this isn't a tale for children, even though it is written from a seven year old's viewpoint - there are adult scenes and themes. You could read/listen to The Ocean at the End of the Lane and get something different from it each time. A fantastical tale, a tale of childhood and our fears that most could relate to or perhaps a glimpse into Gaiman's own childhood.<br /><br /> What a treat to hear Gaiman read his own tale - the inflections given, the pauses taken, the emotions imparted - all from hearing them spoken out loud.<br /><br /> And at the end of the last disk, I felt like a child whose parent closed the book and turned off the light with a 'it's time to go to sleep now.\\" And I never did - I always relived the story and wondered what else might happen. The Ocean at the End of the Lane left me with exactly that feeling - and that's a good thing.f the Lane left me with exactly that feeling - and that's a good thing.
B008JFUN6E|1.0|Rich people get to live in space and the poor people are treated like garbage on earth.  It would have been better if it wasn't so boring and slow.  It was written lazily.  There could have been many emotional moments and plot elements, but so much was left unexplored.

0312370849|4.0|I appreciate my daughter Sandy recommending I read this novel, published in 2008.  It tells of a Polish Jewish family in Paris, caught up by the roundup of Paris Jews in July of 1942--the roundup being carried out by French police.  Sarah is 11 and lockes her brother in a cabinet when she and her parents are arrested, Sarah figuring she will return with the key to let her brother out of his hiding place.  The events of 1942 are intertwined with events in 2002 when an American woman married to a French man researches the events of 1942--and learns of her husband's family's role in the events of that time..  The book has a kind of kid-like start, but soon turns into a poignant and gripping story of the direful events which overtake Sarah and her family.  Interwoven with the 1942 story is the stressful story of the American woman researching the story--who is being urged by her French husband to have an abortion.  While some events are seemingly overblown the story is filled with suspense and one is eager to read  it.

B004QZ9P6K|5.0|It has been a puzzle to me whay so much innovation has come from a small country surrounded by 'enemies', or at least by unfriendly neighbouring countries.  After reading Dan Senor's book I have a better understanding, and in fact, reflect upon why my country may have lost some of its innovative genius, in my lifetime.<br /><br />The pattern of life, education, national service, leadership requirements and opportunities in the Start Up Nation not only enable creativity and enterprise, but almost require it!  All members of congress, leaders and captains of zindustry should spend some time reading and reflecting upon this book!

B009FZHYKU|1.0|The season is very good there is no doubt about it.  But my Sister in law is deaf and we absolutely need the subtitles for her.
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|The kids in this movie are amazingly good and Matthew McConaughey is too. Captures the feel of the rural South.  The bad guys are a little 2-dimensional, but other characters are given a chance to be believable.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I thought that this book may have been too young for me...I'm 26 but I really enjoyed it. The characters seemed much more mature.  A symptom of  dying?  I also thought that the cancer thing might be too depressing and deter me from reading<br /> but there is much more to it. I did however, cry like a baby the last few chapters.
B009CF3P7E|5.0|Star Trek fan from way back. Enjoy Chris Pine and the rest of the current cast. Enjoy watching it on my smart TV. Best investment
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|This movie is fun to watch because of the magic and action.  Morgan Freeman is always good.  I didn't identify with any of the characters and there isn't much character development.  The end is kinda dumb and predictable, but even with all of that, we enjoyed watching the movie.
B0030SZ2D4|4.0|The movie cleared up the missing parts I had in the Chronicles of Riddick. I now understand where Jack came from.

B001AMNL2Q|4.0|The insanity of it all really touched me.  My favorite scene was the US soldier indiscriminately shooting vietnamese from the door gunners position showed me a part of myself that I do not want to acknowledge.  Having never been in combat or in the military I can imagine that I could react to such a stressful situation in that manner.

B009LMTDL0|3.0|This is a rehash of everything we have known about women in the work force for the past 35 years. Some things have changed, but the core issues remain the same. Read this book to refresh the ideas that may have gone dormant in your every day functioning. Pass it on to younger women who haven't seen the changes women have achieved and don't realize that there is still a lot they can do to make a difference.<br />Not the most engaging read, but still packed with solid facts and good suggestions.

Justified by a convenient conscience built upon self-deluding lies and buttressed by our institutions. Good and bad jumbled together, forming a sticky soup of destiny.<br />Welcome to real humanism 101, fully exposed by Kurt Vonnegut in Cats Cradle.  As relevant (and more evident) today as when he was so inspired to speak out. If type A is the dominant personality type, can natural selection lead to anything other than a grotesque end game such as Mr. Vonnegut imagined result?

B007FEFLTO|4.0|This was a book I thoroughly enjoyed reading.  I look forward to reading it a second time ... maybe a third time.  Ken Follett has continued to grow as a serious writer, sustaining his characters and plot-lines seemingly effortlessly.<br />'Winter of the World' was enhanced by my having read 'Fall of Giants' (Book One) previously: same families, familiar backgrounds, new challenges for them each to face.<br />Just hope he maintains his skills for Book Three.
B007EE4XKI|5.0|Little spoiler alert...<br /><br />book takes some great time points from early in the TNG franchise reguarding data, soong, and all data's bretheren. The author did a great job of creating a truly unique perspective on data and I found it to be a great read. A LITTLE Drone in reguards to readability in the middle of the book because of the details to support the books own agenda, but nothing horrid.  I dont read much and this was the first book i read for pleasure since 2003. I truly enjoyed myself!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I must say I'm a huge fan of this Crossfire novel - great story line! I actually like it more than Fifty Shades. Can't wait to read Entwined!
B00EVCD9HY|5.0|Janelle Mon&aacute;e is hands down one of the most exciting and creative artists currently putting out music, and this latest album is a worthy addition to her repertoire. Slightly more focused on R&B than her last album, \\"Electric Lady\\" constitutes the fourth and fifth suites (of a proposed seven) of Mon&aacute;e's epic saga of the world of Metropolis--the futuristic dystopian world of androids as seen through the eyes of rebel android (and Mon&aacute;e alter ego) Cindi Mayweather. \\"Electric Lady\\" balances a thoughtful and probing social conscience with an uncontrollable toe tapping/body throbbing good time.<br /><br />The sci-fi fantastical world of Metropolis full of androids and zombies is  just beyond our reality, which allows Mon&aacute;e the freedom to tackle heavy topics like gender, race, religion and sexuality in a different context without things getting too ponderous and exhaustive. While clearly relevant and important, Mon&aacute;e grounds these discussions with a playfulness which has her pairing questions like \\"Say will your God accept me in my black and white\\" in the same song as \\"...You gotta testify because the booty don't lie\\" (from \\"Q.U.E.E.N.\\"). Aside from her infectious energy and fantastic vocals-much of Mon&aacute;e's brilliance comes from her ability to raise and discuss these issues without it seeming forced, pretentious or angry. She's a feminist, civil rights activist, opinionated and yet still approachable, danceable and fun. Which means her message actually gets through instead of your brain just shutting it all out.<br /><br />Musically, this album is a bit less eclectic than \\"ArchAndroid\\", but still manages to run the gauntlet of funk, r&b, classical, psychedelic punk and jazz. It also sees the appearance of several respected artists like mentor Prince on the funk \\"Givin' Em What They Love\\". Erykah Badu is a righteous soul sister on \\"Q.U.E.E.N.\\" laying down a bridge that gives into Monae showing off some admirable rap skills. These features aren't always successful though as illustrated by the rather tepid duet with Miguel on \\"Primetime\\" which may or may not have been a half hearted attempt at a radio hit. My personal favorites are probably mostly in the first suite as it seems to have a bit more edge, yet it seems Mon&aacute;e's vocal prowess is showed off a bit more in the second suite like on \\"Sally Ride.\\"<br /><br />Now as wonderful as this world of Metropolis is, and as skilled as Mon&aacute;e is at using and manipulating this world--the explanations are still at times a little heavy handed and clunky. Her insistence on putting on this robotic persona at all times does wear out its welcome a little bit. And while at times incredibly thrilling and thought provoking, Mon&aacute;e's many nods and \\"inspired bys\\" to a whole host of different things is also a reference too far sometimes. Far be it for me to tell an artist that they need less layered music--but sometimes you just wish you could see more of  Mon&aacute;e and her essence in her music.<br /><br />That said, Mon&aacute;e is an artist artist--willing and able to make art for herself before even thinking of an audience and I tremendously respect her fearsome commitment to her craft and her concept. In the meantime, I get to enjoy an album that somehow makes my body break out in violent spasms while driving--which I imagine on a more coordinated person would look at lot more like dancing.  And as a cherry on top, I don't have to check my mind at the door either. Janelle Mon&aacute;e is a musical maelstrom who is a shining beacon of individuality and class, not to mention an incredible vocalist--and it's a privilege experience her Metropolis. If we could all be as fearless and passionate as Cindi.<br /><br />For fans of Erykah Badu, Outkast, Lauryn Hill, Kimbra etc....<br /><br />***Mon&aacute;e is on tour right now and I cannot highly suggest going to a concert enough. I saw her a few years ago and was blown away. If you think she's highoctane and energetic in her music videos-prepare for world domination during a live show.a live show.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Catan is my favorite board game. I don't have much to add to the content here on Amazon considering the other 800+ reviews.<br /><br />That said, if you purchase it and love it... I highly suggest buying a well made board from a third party vendor. The board that ships with the box is not that durable, does not interlock, and can be kind of a pain to use. If you find yourself playing often, it might be worth considering a 3rd party board.<br /><br />There are quite a few companies and people trying to solve the issue of the catan board. For example, this Hexels project on Kickstarter:<br />[...]<br /><br />I looked around and ultimately purchased one on Etsy through a guy with the name \\"CustomCatanBoards\\". You can also get it directly from his site.  It's $59 for the 4 player board and it's cut from what looks like a 3d wood printer. The pieces are waterproof and interlock beautifully.<br /><br />Here's a photo of my board:<br />[...]
B00EUS92EI|4.0|I probably have a borderline unhealthy obsession with the single \\"Wonderland\\" off of British native Natalia Kills' debut album--but while I really enjoyed the rest of her debut, it was too derivative to stand up to repeated listens. And yet it was clear that Natalia had so much more potential just raging under the surface. And happily, this is the album that Natalia really steps into her own. \\"Trouble\\" is a much more focused record that rings truer on the authenticity scale, not to mention is chock full of Natalia's trademark witty writing and ridiculously catchy dark hooks.<br /><br />While Rihanna frequently flaunts her \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" persona, Natalia actually seems like the real deal although it might be a stretch to imagine a time when Natalia was ever really innocent. She honestly and bluntly lays out and explores why she is the way she is. Subtlety is not the goal. Drugs, domestic violence, brushes with the law, thoughts of suicide, reckless sexual behavior and above all a plea for parental affection and guidance are all recurring themes.<br /><br />\\"Stop Me\\" and \\"Saturday Night\\" are two hugely catchy album standouts which both delve into her family history and dysfunction a bit like P!nk's earlier work.  Much of the album plays like notes from a therapy session mixed with a steely determination to not just survive but thrive and party till the break of day. The beautiful ballad \\"Devil's Don't Fly\\" is a searingly raw and haunting look into a broken relationship: \\"It's not cause I'm young or from a broken home/ Maybe I just fight cause I don't know where I belong.\\" Musically, though firmly pop---this album seems a bit more drum and bass focused instead of slick synth sounds like on her debut, which I think really propels the sound into being more memorable.<br /><br />\\"Trouble\\" is the top shelf of quality of what mainstream pop has to offer. It's not revolutionary but crawls under your skin and unleashes something deeply sexual and emotionally primal that is intoxicating. It's clear from her producer's discographies, Jeff Bhasker (Kanye, Beyonce, Alicia Keys) and Emile Haynie (Kid Cudi, Eminem, Emeli Sande, Lana Del Rey), that whatever collective wisdom still in the traditional music industry has recognized a star in Natalia and I wholeheartedly agree with their assessment. Don't sleep on Natalia.<br /><br />For fans of P!nk, Marina & the Diamonds, Ke$ha, Miley, Katy Perry etc...<br /><br />**Quick note, don't bother getting a \\"clean\\" version of the album--that really would ruin the impact of many of the songs. Plus, if you're the type of person who wants a \\"clean\\" version, then this probably isn't the type of album for you in the first place.is intoxicating.

B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I enjoyed this movie it had a lot of action and the villain was someone you could really hate!

B00EVCGUNY|5.0|Hannah Reid. Hannah Reid. Hannah Reid. While full credit for the sensual instrumentation and restraint displayed through the music no doubt goes to fellow band members Dot Major and Dan Rothman--a massive part of why this British band is blowing up is all down to lead vocalist and songwriter Hannah. Comparisons to Florence Welch are completely warranted. Powerful, ethereal and emotional--she just lifts the music into a different stratosphere.  This  deceptively minimal yet  intense  album  is one of the best indie pop albums of the year.<br /><br />Lead single \\"Hey Now\\" made a big sonic impression when it first popped up on the internet in 2012--and it still retains all the magic I'd remembered. \\"Wasting My Young Years\\" also especially resonates as it seems Hannah is asking many of the same questions most 20 somethings are asking about themselves and their place in the world. I can see how older people who have their lives all figured out might get aggravated at the general content though. It does tend to trail off into repetitiveness which almost always gets on my nerve-and yet here the lyrics almost serve  as simply an excuse for Hannah to be singing. Honestly, she could be singing the watermelon song and I'd still be in awe, it's a bonus that I happen to identify with and feel where she's at in her life though. \\"Strong\\" and album  closer  \\"If You Wait\\" are other album standouts for me.<br /><br />My one complaint is that this album is simply too short. Hannah's voice is epic. It has a almost mystical quality that the only feeling I can compare it to is that of traditional Celtic band singers like Enya or Clannad (though she doesn't sound like them at all). Her voice somehow just has a sense of history and time that lends itself to epic six or seven minute long songs. However, most of the songs are just barely over 3 minutes in length which doesn't really begin to allow a real sinking in of the sound.<br /><br />That said, if you're fans of artists like the xx, Passion Pit, Lykke Li, or Florence--I would bet money on your enjoyment of this album. It's melodic, subtle, catchy and intriguing. It's quite simply just beautiful music. Highly recommend.ssion Pit, Lykke Li, or Florence--I would bet money on your enjoyment of this album.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|Chosen this for Book  Club to introduce the gang to my passion...sci-fiction. I have read many and consider this work to be one of the best I have read in ages...as well as SHIFT and DUST.  It is my hope that \\"The Gang\\" will stop teasing  me about \\"my passion\\" and look into books with more imagination instead of a diet of romance and present day problems...Boring!
B00C7APVU0|5.0|Wow,all i can say what an amazing sounding album,i think this was a great investment into my music collection.If you like the sounds of Sabbath,Deep Purple and Trapeze combined it would produce spiritual beggars.Great sounds from beginning to end!Old school sound with a new school twist!

B004YW4L5K|5.0|I've always loved Neil Gaiman, read him when I was younger and had someone recommend this book of his to me recently. You should absolutely read it! It's a very compelling story about the nature of belief, about the nature of love and sacrifice, and most importantly about knowing yourself. Also who doesn't like a book where the main character is named Shadow?

B00CWVGBEO|4.0|This movie was entertaining.  It was good to watch on a Saturday afternoon.  I wasn't expecting much but I will watch it again.

B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|I loved this soundtrack. My only problem with it is that I was hoping it would be a much longer CD. It's not a ridiculously long movie, so I guess it's reasonable that this CD was only about 45 mins long in total. It's a lovely listen.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|What a cute little game and every little characters faces and sounds are just adorable! I find myself losing more time then I thought playing this game!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Good, fun action movie!!  Great cast, and a fun couple of hours.  If you like Bruce Willis movies, you'll love this one.  I would compare it a bit to an Ocean's Eleven (newer remake), fun action movie with a few twists.
B000BCE918|5.0|My husband is a huge Jurassic Park fan and this got it fast enough for me to surprise him with it! Awesome movie, awesome seller!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a very fun game I love it and it helps u learn too. the only thing is I don't like wait for money
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|I couldn't tell you if this was a good game or not because it downloaded for two full days and then I couldn't even play it!
B0098QBEXO|5.0|It was a very realistic movie. Great acting. It is unrated so it is vulgar in some places.  Overall I was very happy with it , and it was really easy I watch it on Amazon.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|I picked this book after a friend recommended it a few months ago. I wasn't sure if I would like it so I kept passing it over. I finally decided to give it a go. I read it almost non-stop from beginning to end! It is beautifully written, the characters are amazing, this book had me laughing and crying. I'm glad I finally read it.

B000KG499M|4.0|Does everything it says it will, holding your beautiful creations in dramatic poses, but using this for a High Grade seems quite bulky. What I mean is that this stand has more bulk than many of the models you will be placing on it, and it makes you wonder if your Gunpla you spent so much time on, or the stand is the center of attention.
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|I loved this! It was fun, fast paced, and easy. I loved it enough to buy the first expansion, but how much more money will I have to put into this game to play it all the way?
B004I744AS|5.0|It is so cool and it is good for vocabulary and for school. Like if you need a word or don't know a word this is the right app for you
0385535147|5.0|There's not a lot you can say about a John Grisham book without getting into spoilers. So let me just say this is as good as any of Grisham's other legal thrillers.
1401907725|4.0|Was looking for something different to use and ordered these Angel Oracle Cards. Very good, I think I will have to use them awhile and see how they work out.
B002APU580|5.0|Lots of big words I had to use the dictionary a lot.  But this book brought the movie to life for me. Now when I watch the movie I really enjoy it.
1401937268|5.0|I received the Angel Tarot Cards last week and I love them. They are beautiful and very accurate. The deck is large being it's a 78 card deck (I've been using several 44 card decks) but they are manageable. I am not disappointed at all with these cards.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love the challenge.  I play the game till I win.  Of course there are some games that will never be won,
B000ICXQII|5.0|Another Cronenberg film that indelibly etched haunting images into my brain. This film is more true today than it was when made, considering the internet and its unlimited access to such prurient material. James Woods chews up the scenery in this performance and Debbie Harry couldn't be hotter.
B00915G6YE|5.0|Hate that we are in the final season.  :-(  If you want to root for the bad guy, this is the series for you.  Love, love, love Dexter.  Will miss him terribly.
B004OKFISQ|5.0|great. album is perfect. thanks for sending it quickly. Arrived in good shape and plays well. had to have this vinyl
B0019IIPXQ|4.0|This was an entertaining film. I recommend you watch this if you haven't seen it, and like action/scifi movies. It won't win any awards, but was good.
B006S08RLU|5.0|This is how I wish the world was 'IRL' ;-)  Besides the magical story, the cinematography is absolutely glorious.  And, of course, it ends happily which is how things would end in [my fantasy] 'RL'.
B004ZISVWC|4.0|When I sat down to watch this movie I did not really have high expectations. However the beauty of the countryside being filmed soon sucked me in. Really quite breathtaking, and I've decided if I ever get the chance I'd like to go to Norway. The movie was really quite funny and all the characters quite believable, the students, the hunter, the government officials covering it up. I liked how they worked in slip a politician made in referencing trolls in a speech. I also liked the nod to the childrens story Three Billy Goats Gruff. It's those little touches that made it awesome! I'd kinda like to watch it again!
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|This book was a very good read.  Had some twists and turns in there I didn't see coming. Surprising ending.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Great read. I couldn't put it down.  The author artfully hinted at the circumstances of Pat's medical issues throughout the book which kept your interest until the end when all was revealed.
B0030SZ2D4|4.0|Much like Arnold in the Terminator,  this is the perfect vehicle for Vin Disel's monotone tough guy routine. Captivating storyline,  fast paced,  decent mystery,  well timed reveals. Overall,  a good entertainment.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Can't live without this app and wouldn't want to try. I highly recommend to anyone who wants to stay in His word everywhere they go.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Most fun on a mobile possible. Wish was a way to get coins faster game gets tedious having to purchase everything
B00DDXJRJG|4.0|This is a neat little app. It works as described and makes a difference on my s4. Only reason I took one star off is if you don't know what you're doing there is no real tutorial. Other wise it's a well put together app.
1250030951|2.0|You know that awkward moment when all your friends (and the rest of the world it seems like) love something and you're just like - oh, yeah..not really my thing. I feel like this happens to me A LOT with books. The people whose opinions and tastes I respect the most LOVE something - and it makes me sad when I don't like it. And here's yet another example - though this one does have a twist - and that is that I can appreciate it and I understand why people love it; it just wasn't my type of book.<br /><br />First things first - Rainbow Rowell is a wonderful writer. I adore her writing style but unfortunately the actual content of her books just don't jive with me (so far!). It happened with Eleanor & Park and now again with Fangirl. While my issues with Eleanor & Park were mostly character-based (please don't get me started on Eleanor), the main problem I had with Fangirl was that I felt like absolutely nothing happened. There was no plot. Yes, I know that not all books are plot based but there are many character-driven books that I love - Please Ignore Vera Dietz by A.S. King, Looking for Alaska by John Green, Anna and the French Kiss by Stephanie Perkins - tons of contemporary YA novels aren't plot-driven - but I felt like things actually happened in them. And, yes, I realize that things happened in this book but I mean that I don't feel like anything happened in a substantial way - Cath's moment of realization never really hit me. I found her boring and plain - I would have much rather read about her twin sister, Wren's college experience. She was a vibrant character - she had spunk. So did Cath's roommate. So did Levi. Everyone in this book was interesting except Cath.<br /><br />I will say that I found Cath's Simon Snow fanfiction to be best part about this book. I would 100% love to read those works of fanfiction. And that's how I 100% know that I do love Rainbow Rowell's writing; it's just that this character and this time in her life didn't work for me. College isn't as bland as it seemed in Cath's world and I couldn't help but think to myself \\"That was so not my college experience.\\".<br /><br />I know that there will be a Rainbow Rowell book out there for me one day - (maybe it's Attachments - tons of people have told me try this one) - but I just haven't found it yet.ge isn't as bland as it seemed in Cath's world and I couldn't help but think to myself \\"That was so not my college experience.\\".<br /><br />I know that there will be a Rainbow Rowell book out there for me one day - (maybe it's Attachments - tons of people have told me try this one) - but I just haven't found it yet.
1591844096|4.0|I was incredibly impressed with the ideas presented in Linchpin. The idea that art is the new currency of our world was a breath of fresh air. I struggle to believe that there are CEO's and pastors and teachers that believe in this idea like Godin, but I'm begging, praying, pleading for them to come over to this way of thinking. Not only that, but Godin presents the idea of generosity in a new way - showing that, in fact, the only way to get what you want from your work is to give your work away without any expectation of reciprocation. As always, I wish the book was a little shorter - but who can be blamed for ranting about a subject that's worth ranting about?<br /><br />Separate praise for Godin as a writer:<br />As a Christian, I tend to take all secular books, whether business or otherwise, with a grain of salt. Godin made that need to guard myself a virtual nonissue. Of course, there are references to buddhism and other cultures, but always in the best \\"take what's wonderful and use it\\" kind of way. I didn't get the impression that Godin was a born-again believer and disciple of Jesus or anything, but in spite of comments that most Christians would be offended by (although probably shouldn't be), Godin made himself extraordinarily accessible and open. He made himself vulnerable and presented his artwork for those who were willing to receive it In doing so, he listened to his own advice...a rare trait.<br /><br />And he only charged so he could count if his art was working or not (and hopefully, so he could fund himself writing another book and continue blogging). Buy the book; read it. It'll help you connect with people and view yourself as a one-of-a-kind gift to the world, like you are.
B008B3H4VQ|4.0|I love Linkin Park, but their new stuff I'm not as into. I wish they'd go back to their roots of heavier sounds.
B002NPUCRQ|5.0|Another great album from Taylor.  Her music is fun, clean, and offers many opportunities to sing loud while dance driving.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Disappointed that they killed Matthew off.  Loved his character. Should be interesting going forward to see how Mary fares as a widow with a new baby.
B003WTE886|5.0|Another great album from Taylor.  Her music is fun, clean, and offers many opportunities to sing loud while dance driving.
B002RI90WM|5.0|We have a story revealed through the eyes of a character who learns to deal with the frustration of his limited ability to express himself fully to those whose lives he becomes part of.

B00BWBHIUG|3.0|Love this game very relaxing to play.  Got it for my son.  He loves to  create the reefs and to see all the different fish.
B004LWZWBU|4.0|This is a great movie about Birding; or is it about human intent and the perpetual evolution of relationships, with birds and those we are involved with, building lasting memories and relationships and those baring the heart ache of misdirected sacrifice. It is a brief introduction to hundreds of birds and the beauty and delight they offer. Steve Martin, Jack Black, and Owen Wilson bring to the film very different characters, lives, relationships, and the inevitable change enduring the steady march of time and life; and the choreography of structuring passions, desires, and pursuit of joy and harmony. I am surprised this movie hasn't done better whether you are a birder or not. The trek across varied environments offer beautiful cinematography merged with the beauty of birding and the engaging diversity of brilliantly developed story and characters.
B001NHNG64|1.0|To enjoy this novel you will need to be prepared to suspend your disbelief - a lot - the situations presented in this book are rediculously implausible.  MINOR SPOILERS TO FOLLOW: The characters do not even act consistenly in character the first 10 or so pages detail ruthless and sadistic killings of innocent civilians, but when Reacher is accidently snared as extra catch in a kidnapping, he is somehow not killed at the the first opportunity!  The story for Reacher should have ended right there and frankly I should have put the book down right there.  Reacher is not killed after his multiple escapes and recaptures (and general antagonistic behavior), but is instead shown around the bad guys' operation while they tell him all about themselves - yah right, that would happen.<br /><br />The actions of the FBI, Army, and President of the United States are completely idiotic, yet are portrayed as being astute, calculating, and even heroic. MAJOR SPOILERS TO FOLLOW: Does it even seem remotely likely that 3 FBI agents in street clothes and armed with government-issue .38's would try to attempt a rescue mission against a 100-man, heavily-armed, militia stronghold deep in the mountains of Montana?  How do you think that goes? Especially when two(!) of those agents are on the take to the militia. Then the \\"genius\\" bad guy gloats over the radio that he had an agent on the take instead of turning them back out to continue spying - uh huh, that makes sense.<br /><br />Then there is the writing itself - full of overly-long description that do not move the story forward.  For instance, there are three long passages describing the sequence of a bullet being fired and leaving the barrel of a gun.  One such passage is unnecessary, three is just tedious.
B009AY04A8|4.0|This was an interesting story. The visuals were colorful and different from most games. The minigames were fun. When I  got to the last chapter I was so sad that it was over.
B002TWWOHE|5.0|This series deals with the FBI's white collar division working with a con man as a consultant.  Lots of twists and turns with a sense of humor included.  The FBI agent feels a tentative loyalty with the con.  The con man is always on the cusp of returning back to his old ways.  You see insights into the con man world.  Not too deep but entertaining.
B0061QD82E|5.0|I bought this and introduced it to my 5 and 6 year old daughters. After the first viewing it was all they wanted to do every evening for a week - watch it again!  One weekend day they watched it once in the afternoon and wanted to watch it again in the evening, which is unusual because they normally spend a good time of the day outside. I think the newness has worn off a little bit now - they only ask for it once every three days.
1451624468|4.0|The science is very interesting.<br />But Krauss doesn't clarify that science is merely a description of what we observe in the universe. In no way does it answer the questions Why is This Here? or Where does it all come from?<br />Sure we may be able to come up with a consistent description of what we see and use that to predict things that fit that description, but it says nothing more.<br />I suppose God could have created us yesterday and made it seem to us like we'd been here a while and evolved or whatever God felt like making us think was happening.<br />I've never met anyone that had any idea what we're doing here or where we are going or came from. Or of what is really happening. Some say they do but they aren't very convincing.<br />That part is just as much a mystery as ever!
B006O5YHUY|5.0|One of the best fighting movies I've seen in awhile. It ranks up there with Rocky and Vision Quest as my all time favorite fight movies.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|A Clever fun exciting sad great time. Seen it three times now. You really learn to care for the little guy.
B009GX6600|5.0|I like NCIS series and would recommend it over all. Of course all series have some individual programs that are not as enjoyable.
B001NLL93W|5.0|It was an easy read with nice twists and turns in a battle of good and evil.  Regardless of some inconsistencies where good was painfully behind evil almost every step of the way until the very end, I loved the book, the plot, and the development of all characters from previous series.<br />I like the style, where author leave us 'hanging' while telling us the story of each character and intertwining it into the story-line as a whole - kept me reading into the late nights...  This is the best book so far, IMHO - 4.5 stars.
B00B2166BS|3.0|Like the subject line said. Cable came with a 0.85 Amp adapter. Took 12 hrs for a full recharge. Once I bought a 2 amp adapter,...full recharge now takes about 5 hours (or about 20 percentage points every hour).  Update: A few weeks has passed since my initial review and it is worth repeating, this is a must have item for your Nexus! Works great WITH a 2 AMP adapter.  If you have the 2 AMP adapter, it gets 5 stars. As my initial purchase came with a meager, weak 0.85 AMP adapter, I'm keeping this review at 3 stars.<br /><br />As a reminder, it is best to fully discharge (then recharge) your battery every couple months to get the most life out of your Nexus (same applies to any cell phone or laptop battery).
B005HEQ4XQ|5.0|Of All the Star-Trek genres, The Next Generation Line-up is my favorite so any aspect of it is Outstanding in my opinion

B000002KIK|5.0|Always liked this album the best.  Thought it had the best guitar rifts and Ozzy sounded best on this album.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This has lived up to all the great reviews it has recieved, I am looking forward to watching the next season.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I've watched the movie first and, in my experience, a book usually is better as lot of 'things' got cut off in a movie.  This book was an exception of that rule.  The book was too slow... Though AMAZON doesn't have half-stars, I'll give it 3.5 as I like the plot in general and will be reading the next book.<br />I hope next one is going to be better.
B003JH8LPW|3.0|Not a bad thriller but some of the story lines I found predictable. Maybe I have read too many of the author`s books.
B00DKY4LBW|5.0|Probably s the best Arctic Monkeys album, until now. Is more obscure, more powerful but still in the same line. Good songs, good production and some surprise more melodic. Is his masterpiece until now. Great.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|The Goonies was a childhood favorite of mine and watching it again as an adult I noticed a lot of adult humor that I missed when I was young. Great movie for all!!
B0090SI582|2.0|I really wanted to like this film, but all the moping and whining from every main character dragged this film down.  The action scene on the train was great and I liked his redhead sidekick, but the rest seemed pointless.  For the first time, I was bored in an X-man movie.  I hope he is done mourning and will be back to his old sarcastic, arrogant attitude in the next film.
0385528787|5.0|Margaret Atwood is damn funny. Her humor highlights one of the human race's most redeeming qualities and survival skills in what some call the \\"apocalyptic\\" tale, \\"Maddaddam.\\" A masterpiece of language, Atwood's incredible passion for words and stories are on full display. I see many of the other reviews describe this book as installment of the \\"end of the world\\" genre. What? This isn't for doomsday preppers. This is for people in love with life, as Atwood obviously is. What she describes in this last installment of her trilogy, which began with \\"Oryx and Crake,\\" is how humans always lose when they fool with Mother Nature. The power of creation leaves tractor treads over all our lives in today's world, we lose people we love, we adjust to age and failures, we cope constantly to fight the overwhelming loneliness of ourselves. Why do we need Botox for migraines, what is exactly in those antidepressants we are taking, and cosmetic surgery doesn't bring our youth back. This book is a glorious ode to surrendering to and, in fact, joining the creative forces of the universe. Nature's tools are what give us power, sunlight, cultivation, a life closer to the earth. And then we pass that knowledge down. We tell our stories, we touch each other with our voices, our thoughts, as little Blackbeard so innocently attests in the book. Because life goes on with us or not. We are only immortal in the hearts and minds of the ones we love and revere. Atwood speaks the truth - \\"Life, life, life, life, life. Full to bursting, this minute. Second. Millisecond. Millienium. Eon.\\"
B001NLKZUA|4.0|This part was such an improvement from the 1st part.  It was much faster, easier to read and the presentation was much better...  Both characters and plot were developing very nicely throughout the book and left you with a desire to read the next part.  If you read City of Bones, you will like this part.
B005IQZB14|4.0|A book about rediscovery of one's self after a big loss.<br />Part adventure book, part self healing.<br />The blend of time on the trail and flashbacks to her life were very well done.<br />An easy read.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Fixed problem.  Charged after a few minutes--enough to start working again.  When screen lit up we knew this was the solution.
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|Slow beginning...unable to decipher who or what was going on.  Skipped ahead only to find it was still boring.  Finally gave up.
B00E0MCYPS|4.0|There are 4 cars and 4 tracks, which is enough to make the interesting enough without any real depth. The physics are fun, and though the cars' tendency to slide at extremely low speed feels unrealistic, it's still a good driving game when you get used to it.<br /><br />Edited this review from 3 stars to 4 because I found the pause button on my Android tablet. The back button at the bottom of the screen pauses the game and brings up the menu to restart or quit the race. Nonetheless, it's still more of a 3.5 star game.

B003YFIUW8|5.0|This unusual, thoughtful story was impossible to put down.  I felt almost a part of the story, and could not wait to read what was next.  Seeing this situation through the eyes of a five year old was fascinating.  I loved the book.
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|Not enough development of the characters to keep you interested in the plot.  That being said, Tobey Maguire and Leonardo Dicaprio's performances compelled me to watch the entire movie.

B008602KQI|5.0|This movie was almost as good as the book. I'm looking forward to the next one. Let's catch on fire!
B00BMKH5NW|3.0|Fangirl was one of my most anticipated reads for September but when I picked it up and started reading it...it just didn't work out. This was like an on-again off-again relationship...it was always an option even though I didn't necessarily want it to be...but at the same time I couldn't make myself step away from in permanently (I don't DNF books). In the end I was somewhere between happy and burnt out.<br /><br />The overall story is one that I can get behind because I can honestly say...I get it. I can understand a character who is so in love with a fandom it covers her room (Yes that is a Slytherin banner on my wall...yes I do have a movie theater sized poster of Snape....what of it?). I get it, I use to write fanfiction and while I never hit the popularity that Cath did I understand the pressure of having people constantly telling you they can't wait for the next chapter or that something you wrote doesn't sit right with them. I even understand the social anxiety and the fear of waking up to find yourself marked with the 'crazy' pen. So what was the problem? Everyone else. I spent about 53% of this book hating most of the side characters, Wren included, and since this is a book about relationships it felt incredibly dragged out. Some of them were flat out rude and said increasingly insensitive things because it's part of their dry humor, others turned into horrible people and, other than the reasons I have assumed, we are not actually given reasons as to why. It was a struggle to care about any of Cath's relationships for two reasons: the characters were hardly worth caring about towards the beginning and because at times Cath wasn't trying either. I'm glad to say after the half-way mark it started getting better and by the end I did like mostly everyone, I just wish it didn't have to force myself to read to that point. I did think Levi was a sweetheart, though like all the others he was mildly annoying towards the beginning but his charming chivalry won me over.<br /><br />I want everyone to know that this isn't the fault of Rowell's, her writing is actually really nice. I loved the flow and the feel, and I liked how the details stood out and made things really pop. I just had some serious personality meshing issues. I do appreciate what this book is though and I love that it deals with real college struggles, forming new relationships, and how you can love a fictional world so much it becomes a part of who you are.<br /><br />I think this is one of those books that just didn't work for me, but I can definitely see why so many others are going to love it.r.<br /><br />I want everyone to know that this isn't the fault of Rowell's, her writing is actually really nice.

0761169253|5.0|I really loved this book. I felt motivated and inspired after reading it! :D I definitely recommend people to go buy and read this book.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Great game lots of fun to play, for all ages!!  Love the challenges for each level, it's very addicting and fun
B00CTT9646|5.0|I loved the movie and I want to rewatch the movie as many times that I want. If I can get the film and get a nifty phaser with it, but having to sacrifice commentaries or other extras, so be it! Extras are always repetitive anyways.
B00D6QU6RW|4.0|I was glad to see the guys all together again it brought the fullness back to their sound.I liked this album but not as much as the ones before due to all the memories attached to the songs but like all music you have to let it grow on you.
B00640UICA|5.0|This is a fun game that I enjoyed despite myself. I downloaded it for my young daughter, but while it is too hard for her, it's great for filling a little time when you are waiting and don't have a book nearby
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|i have enjoyed this series of books, one that is hard to put away, i would of read all 3 books in one night if i could of. Not only a great love story but also plenty of suspense. Cant wait for the next addition of the series.
B0031RS8AI|5.0|I just love Sophie Kinsella and the way she writes.  Such easy and light books that I can pick up even when I just have a spare second or two.  I am quite addicted ;-)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|again so well done can't wait for the next season. Sad ending how will all these lives carry on next season?
B0064MGU98|5.0|Great writing...great acting...worth seeing...could not wait til next episode...don't like this requirement of more words than I want to use
B0026772N8|5.0|Its value increases over time. Relevant commentary on quality (or lack thereof). New introduction by the author provides valuable context to the original.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Always makes me feel good to listen to Bruno!! Cant say enough good things about it. Cant wait for him to come down here for a concert!!
B00DQVST76|5.0|I was there in Miami and enjoyed so much the concert. almost 1 year ago i saw it in Epix and i love it. This is a brilliant concept and a complete journey perfectly made by Madonna and her team. She go trough her faces and you can see the whole concept and congruence in her art. Shes not just a performer, shes a truly artist with a message. A concert full music and visual art mixing pop classic and new song of this remarkable artist. There's only one Queen, and that's Madonna B*tch!
B000WAEK0E|5.0|oh my what a deal this is - 3 discs plus the digital copy of all tracks - put them on my phone and the discs in my car.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|sure ya have to do so missions but that is what makes it fun! the graphics are awesome, there are little cutsences, and u can make the town ur own way!
B00594XOZU|4.0|Great app! Even though it crashes sometimes, I still love the app and how it works. I would recommend it to anyone! :)
B008U3NU38|5.0|This is a magnificent box set. The remastered sound is better than the batch that came out in 2000, and the 3 discs of remixes, rare material, etc. are perfect to track through by themselves. Paul Simonon designed the box itself, and it's beautiful.<br /><br />WARNING: \\"The Clash\\" is the UK version in the box. So, you need to hold on to the US version from the last batch of remasters. I always liked the US track listing better.
B005H9B44A|4.0|I found the movie to be very entertaining.  The story line was easy to follow and the movie is appropriate for children.  My grandchildren enjoyed this movie.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Good game with quick reactions....the ads are getting to be a drag----especially the vids-  otherwise good way to spend airplane time
B0051XQI84|5.0|Finally an excellant movie for young and old alike.  Great graphics and script.  Will be adding this one to my movie collection
B0012NVGHU|5.0|Best movie ever! The music is so amazing..I've seen it 5 times.I also saw the play on Broadway..excellent but the movie is much better.
B002ZG999U|3.0|Yea the title is a little misleading. The movie was that bad, but considering the cast of characters I expected much more. This is what happens when actors try to diversify their talents outside of just acting. Get RED with Bruce Willis, that's what this should have been.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|An amazingly tragic love story. I can only dream of being half as awesome as these characters. Funny and heartbreaking. This story will stay with me for a very long time.
B00785P2QC|3.0|good game. fun to play. instructions are easy to folks and pretty simple. I recommend it to all people who like building stuff.
B00DOPEGAS|1.0|The instructions are not clear and need to be followed exactly or the rubber bands won't loop and will fall apart. The single row is easy if someone shows you how to do it but the more complicated ones are extremely difficult even for adults. Toys R Us was offering a special event on how to use it and the Toys R Us employee was getting frustrated making the rainbow loom and had to leave to take a break after two failed attempts. She said the  waterfall is not doable. This is definitely not for 6 years old which was the recommended age. It more for 10+ years old who actually read the instructions carefully. The pictures diagrams were not helpful. This was a very frustrating toy and was not enjoyable to make but the finished bracelet does look cute. The rubber bands are not too durable and break easily.
B006QKJQM6|5.0|Well I was happily surprised that this sequel was just as good as the first movie.  I will be waiting for the 3rd movie when it comes out.  I intend to add this one to my video collection. It is well worth the money
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Amazing!!!! Can not wait to read the rest! I recommend this book to anyone looking for action and a love story!
B005LAIH54|2.0|If you can get it cheep its worth a watch. Graphically it's appealing especially the representation of Kronos but apart from that it was pretty blah.
B008P1EWIM|1.0|Ok guys here is the catch. If I buy an app, I sort of expect a real ad-free experience. The constant nagging to buy the next app, or rate the app every morning after the alarm goes off is a pretty good reason to just delete it, ignore all apps from you and give a rating like this.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's so fun and very entertainment. I like the color and picture of the game, I highly recommend this game for any ages.
B008D30K7E|5.0|The scale of the adventures enjoyed by a man of one hundred should inspire everyone who reads and enjoys the tale to make the most of the life we are given. It was way more enjoyable than the title suggested.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|Anne Hathaway deserves every award received for her work on this film, as it is incredible.  I do not know whether I was more surprised by her performance or Hugh Jackman's, as they were both terrific after careers previously dominated by lightweight performances.  How could the movie have rated 5 stars?  Two things would need to have been different.  The first would be far fewer prolonged close-ups on most of the solo singers.  The second would be to not allow Russell Crowe to sing.
B007VYQ6DS|5.0|This movie is so awesome! I love all the Disney Nature movies and would highly recommend them to anybody! They're very educational and just all around wonderful family films. This one is especially good in the way that it is very entertaining for little kids in particular, even more so than the other Disney Nature films. LOVE IT!
B002VECM6S|4.0|I'm not much of a sport guy but this was an interesting and true story. It's also nice to see that there are people out in the world that still care about others.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|I can find it in my bag!  And it sits nicely when I am on the treadmill.  Sometimes when I'm doing something else while listening to an audio tape or watching a show, it starts to slip a little.
B00DJYJQ36|5.0|A couple meets on a train and spends a life-changing night in Vienna. They part ways. Nine years later, they meet again in Paris, where they reconnect and wonder what life would be like if they hadn't gone on their own paths. And now, nine more years have gone by as we meet them again, married with children.<br /><br />In most movies, this would be the definition of `happily ever after'. Sure, 'Before Midnight' could easily have turned into a soapy tearjerker in the wrong hands, but under the helm of Linklater, Delpy and Hawke, it turns into something that is rarely witnessed in cinema: A movie that has love at its very core, but at the same time, is almost anti-romantic. At the very least, it challenges most people's notion of what 'romantic' is.<br /><br />This couple is real and their issues are real. Their staying together for a decade and having had kids has taken a toll on them. The movie, unlike `Before Sunrise' or `Sunset', is no longer about a random encounter in a beautiful European city. It is about sharing a life together, and the difficulty to accept people for what they really are. It is about intimacy (or lack thereof), guilt and things left unsaid. It is about a love that does not do \\"happily ever after\\". It is about \\"and now, what?\\"<br /><br />And precisely because of that, it is human. Its humanity lies in reflecting the flaws and the heartbreak that is so close to anyone who's ever had a fully committed relationship permeated by love. And coming to terms with how each single person relates to this overpowering force of nature is one of the biggest challenges a couple can face. With `Midnight', these immense characters, that almost carry a larger-than-life weight on their shoulders, have reached a brand new level of depth that makes this entry, perhaps, the best in the series.<br /><br />At the end of the film, I heard a woman whisper to her male companion, \\"but where is the love?\\". Well, I definitely saw love - rough and complex and beautiful. I did feel like handing her a copy of \\"A walk to remember\\", though. If you're looking for a fairy tale, you are in for a perfect disappointment.  But if you are looking for an immensely enriching walk that is both exhilarating and heart-breaking, look no further. Meet, once again, Jesse and Celine.id feel like handing her a copy of \\"A walk to remember\\", though. If you're looking for a fairy tale, you are in for a perfect disappointment.  But if you are looking for an immensely enriching walk that is both exhilarating and heart-breaking, look no further. Meet, once again, Jesse and Celine.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It's a rare book that doesn't let itself leave my grip until I'm through with it.  This was one of those few.  Thank you, Mr. Howey.
B009GED3HS|5.0|I love this show... This was a great season to an already great show. Ready to see Ted find his future misses...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Thank you so much!! I have been waiting ever since they went on the world tour thing for them to go to Russia. I am so happy. The game is great. Great graphics, great gameplay, and cool concept for the world tour thing.
B001GCUO5M|5.0|It's a must see. This was a great story with some interesting turns. I didn't used to be a DeCaprio fan, probably because he's better looking than me, but he really can act and shows us just how well in this movie.
B00E3D7WGU|3.0|i couldn't agree with the other review more. it is a straight audio rip from the Epix version and i'm assuming the 2.0 stereo track that would be on the dvd/blu-ray (not sure, i haven't gone to buy the blu-ray yet). whoever mixed this should be fired. it really does sound bootlegged... her voice is way too loud and the actual music is drowned out by the screaming and yelling of the audience 95% of the time.<br />all her other live cd tour releases have sounded great and have been edited and mixed properly... this is a huge disappointment.<br />the cd-r note is also rather odd, and the fact that it's not sold in stores.<br />the blu-ray BETTER sound wayyyy better than this or i'm gonna be one unhappy Madonna fan :/<br /><br />Just got the 2cd set from Amazon... it's the exact same thing as the digital download from iTunes or if you bought it here. basically just the 2.0 soundtrack directly from the dvd/bluray. again, not the best audio mixing... but i knew what i was getting since i DLed it on the 10th from iTunes. i could've saved myself $15 and just burned it myself on 2 cds... however as a collector i wanted a psychical copy. packaging looks like an official release. includes the booklet and the cds have a black top with writing like the dvd/bluray. i cant complain about the audio cd edition cuz i knew exactly what i was getting.
B00DSTBMMU|5.0|I only read the first review before buying this and was a bit worried by it but know enough to make up my own mind and did I ever.  JUST NOW LISTENED TO IT FOR THE FIRST TIME DRIVING HOME AND EVERY SONG IS AMAZING!  Sheryl Crow has never sounded (or looked!) better; the songs are a hot mix of some hard driving..some sad and soulful..all sung with perfect range and pitch plus sung with sexy, rich tones; SHERYL IS CLEARLY RIGHT AT HOME WITH COUNTRY MUSIC..NONE OF THE SONGS SOUND FORCED SLASH FAKE..THEY ARE ALL INCREDIBLY HEARTFELT AND TOTALLY ORIGINAL..I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE AT ALL!!
B008469DGY|5.0|I don't play too many games so when I find one I like it really has to bring it before I give it a turn. Well, this game BRINGS it! I find myself really wasting loads of time trying to beat this thing. I see how folks can get caught up in playing games now, and it's thanks to Flick Golf.<br />I love the variety of courses you get to play, the changing wind conditions, and it's not too easy or too hard, it's just right.<br />Thank you, Full Fat for entertaining a hard to amuse guy, you folks rock!<br />If anyone wants to waste time, and have a blast doing it, buy this cool little game.
0143143492|3.0|I would have to read this myself. I couldn't listen to it because it's too mono-tone and I have a hard time paying attention. Some people my find this to be their preference. I gave it 3 stars because I know overall it's a prosperous messagr. I'm just sad that I can't find more audio books with enthusiasm and music such as Rhonda Byrne's. I ended up giving it my supervisor lol.
B00DJWV11I|4.0|I wasn't expecting to much from this book, but boy, was I so surprised! The book was so enjoyable, showcasing the wit of the author via a male outlook & other characters banter. Please don't judge it by the stereotype cover (plz haven't we had enough already) & give the book a try. It's a little gem!
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|The hype was so big on this book but it was a huge let down for me. It was forgettable, and I can't believe it was made into a movie.
B009AVC922|5.0|I watched this back in the mid-90s when my mother let me rent it from blockbuster and she didnt know about &#34;cartoons&#34; like this. It is still a great movie to watch.  Love the story and the fight scenes.  I bought it because my girlfriend and I were talking about old movies we loved and I thought of Ninja Scroll.  She agreed to watch it but fell asleep withing 2 minutes- (not due to the movie, but from work).  No worries.  I was good to go and enjoyed every moment of it.  We will try for round 2 when I know she doesnt work.  ;)
B00BHMF578|5.0|Super intense, love the accuracy of setting and character development. Ben Affleck is really impressive in this piece. Highly recommended.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is an excellent young adult book. It is well written and the suspense keeps you reading. It has just enough romance.
B00CUIVGZS|4.0|Once again Chic doing his thing between playing with the boys from Return to Forever. I saw The Vigil live and wanted to retain the music in my soul!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Finding objects hidden in pictures. Maybe 20-30 minutes of game play before your energy runs out, unless you want to make an in app purchase. Don't need to though.
B004YKSXYW|5.0|It's well documented and with clear explanations. Easy to follow and good selection of events. The only thing to improve could be the fast ending with poor explanations on second world war.
B0073Q0DZG|5.0|All actors are great...makes me wish I could go do a big year!<br />If you like nature and birds this is a  must see.
B004SKLD9A|5.0|this the greatest action movie ever a buddy at work told me about this movie and he was right this movie is the 1 of the best action movies ever made and i love the sword play  in this movie am a knife collector and i love the  sword battles
0140386335|4.0|Having grown up watching the film version about twenty times and still listening to Limahl's The Neverending Story song about once a month, I was pleasantly surprised to discover there was a book behind the movie(s). If you saw the second movie, my apologies. The less said about that film the better. This book covers the story of the two movies, although having now read the book, it appears the first movie was more faithful to the book than the second.<br /><br />Bastian is an introvert. An introvert who enjoys books and doesn't much like interacting with the people around him. One day he steps into a bookshop and discovers a book called - take a random guess. Yes, The Neverending Story. Beginning to read it he discovers that the land of Fantastica (Aside: Fantasia really does roll off the tongue better) is dying and that the Childlike Empress is mysteriously ill. Now Atreyu, the protagonist of our book, is sent on a quest to discover how to cure the Empress.<br /><br />Those who know the film will know that the quest itself is the ultimate \\"the journey is more important than the destination\\". To say more defeats the surprise of this book for those who haven't read it. And if you really are only familiar with the first movie (lucky you) then you're in for a great surprise because there is a whole lot more to the story after the critical moment. The book is far richer than the movie.  The way that the Bastian chapters were in purple and the Fantastica chapters were in green was a nice touch too.<br /><br />There was some heavy C.S. Lewis influence on parts of the book, especially towards the end. This draws away from some of the originality of the book because you feel as if you've read this book. But it is still a fun book to read that puts a smile on the face and helps keep the spirit of magic alive.
B000000HRP|5.0|Again love these guys back in the day and have the album, just need to listen to them often! Jazz is my love of music
B004MC8CA2|5.0|enjoying reading the bible but it is great just to listen and have some read it to you... It is always refreshing listen to the Lord words
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Best app.....super easy even my four year old knows how to &quot;clean the kindle&quot;  recommend to everyone!!  Only press a few little things and it is ready to go!  :)
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|I like the scene with the massage chair-it's priceless and I laugh even though I have watched the movie several times
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much and looked for more stories by this author, but<br />couldn't find any.  I did think it was very thought provoking, but very sad.
B0040I09RM|5.0|This has been a great series and I cannot believe that I didn't start watching this show sooner.  I am so glad that there are great shows still out there that are NOT reality shows.  I would totally recommend this series!  I am a huge Jax (Charlie Hunnam) fan and Gemma (Katey Sagal) is awesome!!!  I have already started watching season 2 and cannot wait to see what happens next.
B005IH0MM6|3.0|An ok story , I did not find it on par with other books by the same author, yet it keeps the reader interested.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I enjoy Facebook because it keeps me close to my family... Near and far we keep each other updated with family affair through picture or general updated posting... great way to communicate with family and friends
B004GXZ69W|4.0|This product is really good for my tennis elbow. The only problem is the packing is not the same for my both purchase. One is the recycle paper type and the other one is the retail type.
147674355X|5.0|I saw this book for the first time on facebook, and I knew that I had to read it!! And I am so glad that I did. This book was so awesome and touching. It stayed with me for a while. I actually read this book a few months ago, but I never posted it. But when I needed a book to post a review for, this is the first book that I thought of. It is THAT good!<br /><br />Sky is an interesting character. She is not a slut, but she wants people to think she is; however, she does not want to get close to Holder because she heard he has a reputation. All it really comes down to is that she doesn't want to get close to people. But she doesn't know why. She knows that she has a past and secrets, but she doesn't know what they are. It is like her memory has chosen to bury things about her childhood that are bad (possibly). However, those memories start becoming unraveled when she meets Dean Holder.<br /><br />Dean Holder is an amazing male character. He is sexy and sweet. He cares about Sky even when she pushes him away. He is just amazing. I just have nothing more to say about him.<br /><br />I really don't want to go into the plot too much simply because the plot is so...what's the right word...intricate. If I give any of it away, I will have a mass amount of followers yelling at me because I ruined the book. But I will say that she (Colleen Hoover) knows how to write a book. She has a plot that twists and turns in an amazing way and makes you crave for more! It was just exciting, and heart breaking, and hot. I just loved it!<br /><br />The Verdict<br />All I have to say is GET THIS FIVE STAR BOOK!!<br /><br />Check out the review at [...]!!
B005KMX866|3.0|I am a really big Chris Issac fan and this is OK, but not one of my favorite CD's by him.
B003HKN51Q|5.0|Liked the film for what we saw, or were allowed to see of Elvis on tour and on stage. His control of audience, the support he needed and by the end of 15 days and 15 concerts, the toll on the man.<br />He had an amazing voice and crowd appeal, and he knew, like all good performers, how to use it. But he is part of a team, and the team supports him. Very interesting to watch, as someone who has been in the arts and performance, just what is necessary to get to be that great!
B0074QGGK6|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this little book and doubtless will reread it from time to time to remind myself of its absolute truths!
B000HF4TIM|5.0|While the language is a bit strong, this is what makes Bruce a &#34;Die Hard&#34; kinda guy! Great action and witty & sly humor! Get the pop corn and settle in-it's a good ride!
B005FQ2H8W|4.0|&#34;A blast from the past!&#34; Hard ro believe this movie was that old but it is a good lesser known Aci-fi from that era.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy playing Solitaire more than any game I have had on my Kindle & my iPhone.  At this time Solitaire is the only game I play.
B004XNGKBS|1.0|Why does it lag so much. This new update messed up the app. Need to fix this asap<br />It used to work fine
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Just when you hit a climax, Christopher McDougall takes you for another ride. Over and over until you are completely awed by the human body, mind and soul.
0763617105|4.0|The images are really nice, and our 5 and 7 year old girls enjoyed the story. The pictures are pretty cute, and show different perspectives of the owls sitting alone on their branch, waiting for mom to return.
B007IK44CK|4.0|Brad Bird builds on the direction JJ Abrams took the series with MI3 and produces an equally suspenseful, funny, engaging actioner. I wondered what sort of digital magic was used to make it look like Tom Cruise was climbing the tallest building in the world. Apparently very little, as Cruise actually filmed the scene on the building, suspended on cables that were digitally removed in post production. Ballsy. The best decision anyone ever made in this series is adding Simon Pegg to the cast.<br /><br />Quibbles: Eventually someone will realize Jeremy Renner is a character actor and not a movie star. Besides, his role seems superfluous (\\"Hey, I know, let's cast the guy from The Hurt Locker!\\"), as does the subplot involving Ethan Hunt's wife from the previous film. My big quibble is the final fight between Cruise and the villain. It gives new meaning to \\"over the top\\" as the two battle it out in a high tech car park. My wife remarked it reminded her of Peter Griffin's fist fights with a giant rooster on 'Family Guy\\".
B00EH6SK78|5.0|I've met alot of \\"true\\" metal fans over the years who dismiss DevilDriver as another shallow metal act, over produced songs, dime a dozen, blah blah blah.  I disagree and I feel that just because a band produces great, catchy records like DevilDriver has done with Winter Kills they can't be dismissed as...lacking depth.  There are lots of different genres and feels to great metal bands going back decades from the obscure to the comercially successful and DevilDricer as well as Coal Chamber are a part of the big picture that i generically refer to as metal. Finally, a new album from DevilDriver that I can listen to, over and over.  This album really was an awesome surprise!  Is it just more of the same? Yep, happily.  Do you think it lacks depth?  Than go try some Hinder, I share an office with a guy that gets emotional when he listens to them and he'd probably recommend some Staind as well.
B005R2PDL2|5.0|Deva Premal's music is so calming and etheral I find it easy to settle into my meditation. I look forward to the time when I can attend one of her concerts. I can't imagine how it could be better than the CD but I'd really like to experience it.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book as I did his others.  It is informative and has a story line that will keep you enthralled all the way through
B002U5HKZ6|4.0|Friends highly recommended this book.  They said when it came to an end, they felt like they had lost a dear friend.  I loved the first 3/4 but then I started to get a little weary although I definitely wanted to know what happened at the end.  The story was just a little too long for me, but still worth the effort.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|Good old music.  That is all I have to say. Too many words are needed for reviews...only the people that don't like their products need more words.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great game with lots of twists and turns.  Variations of puzzles and the storyline is unique.  Would recommend to anyone into these type of puzzle/story/games.  One of the best!
0451228731|5.0|I read this book last year and I'd read it again tomorrow. It's captivating and had me thinking about it long after I was done. Superb!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Subway surf is a fun game but it freezes some times. But its really fun to paly  with friends but you should Totaly get the game it awesome
B00AG297GK|3.0|I didn't find anything to great about this movie. Once you have seen Borat I think you have seen all his movies. There really isn't much to say about it.
0385528752|5.0|The book Switch is a very compelling story with tons of great insights about changing when change is hard. I have read it 3 times through and it never gets old. Great read.
B005GFPZYK|2.0|This book is extremely patriotic, which made it quite hard for me to read.  Don't get me wrong, I have ABSOLUTELY nothing against America, I recently travelled there and loved it!  I just find it hard to relate to really patriotic people.  Not just patriotic Americans, but also patriotic Australians, British, etc.<br /><br />It's interesting to hear about how his career related to his family, and the problems they faced throughout his deployments.  It was also interesting to see how he had to change from being on his deployment to moving back into a residential area.  I now have a HUGE amount of respect for the wives of military based husbands.<br /><br />One I thing I liked about this book, is that he didn't glorify war, he seemed to write it how he thought it was.  At times it was long winded, but if it wasn't, you wouldn't be able to understand what happened as well and how his journey progressed.<br /><br />I'll probably watch the movie that's coming out and compare it to the book.  It might give me a different perspective about his story, but I don't think I'd read the book again.
B0088XQDD4|5.0|Nicol Williamson's performance is like nothing else - more conversational than the traditional 'Shakespearean presentation. A stunning rendition, on par with Tennant's.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|But then they turned it around for me.  With the new antagonist and semi new storyline.  I think it's a win.
B006LG7O38|4.0|I wasn't expecting much, it was much better than I expected. I found it to be suspenseful and entertaining. It started off weak and finished strong.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|A pleasurable read. Mr. Altucher's very personal story is delivered in a refreshing matter of fact approach strung together with a sarcastic sentiment of how absurd our lives and artificial worries can get.
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|Why are the dreams so vivid yet not reality?<br />Why must mankind leave the Earth even though the alien invaders were defeated?<br />Why are the murderous Scavs suddenly interested in capturing Jack?<br />As the movie progresses with spectacular special effects (Jack's home, Jack's aircraft, the drones, the buried cities), the answers to the mysteries are slowly revealed to Jack.  The story is told through Jack's eyes and his emotions are almost directly felt.<br />Some of the answers are truly surprises.  These lead to even bigger puzzles, especially for the audience.<br />Overall the movie was great entertainment with great visuals, music, a thrilling story.<br />The back-story of the aliens and their invasion of Earth is sorely needed to completely understand why things are happening as they are.  This is for another movie though.<br />Oblivion is just a played out slice of this future time.
B0054W4JQK|4.0|I like this novel though I found it to be a little long.  Though what did I expect, the book is about a lady with Amnesia!<br />Anyway, apart from it being long it is a good read.  Half way through I got a little sick of it and contemplated not finishing it, but a week later I finished it off and am glad I did so.
0307277887|5.0|It's hard to put into words but the book is fantastic. I love it more then the show for sure. Dexter seems a little more darker and twisted then in the show. Angel seems a little rude with how it acknowledges dex but ill just say overall I really enjoy the book.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Such an enjoyable series. Did not watch it when it aired on television, but found it on Amazon - and as a PRIME member, found that I could view at no charge. What an pleasant and unexpected surprise. Series is just wonderful.
0425266060|5.0|love the series! i wish they didnt drag it out so much though. if you read fifty shades you will love this one as well.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I think this app is very entertaining and fun because I love bingo and I used to play at the library! But they stopped doing that so having this app I can have right at my reach without having to drive anywhere!!
B005I4JG80|5.0|I enjoyed this book a great deal. The authors does an excellent job of presenting the highs and lows of French parenting while juxtaposing it with the American style.
B0035YDM4Y|4.0|I liked this book more than I expected to.  I had previously read American Sniper and found it quite confronting, as it was very patriotic and I didn't quite understand the American culture, but in American Sniper he suggests Lone Survivor.<br /><br />Marcus Luttrell has gone to great lengths to explain just how hard it is training and being a navy seal.  For me, it explained the American navy culture a lot better than the previous book I had read.  I found that this book really makes you appreciate your life and the people around you, and makes you acknowledge what these people go through to protect their country.<br /><br />Because it's quite detailed, and at times I found to be a little confronting, it did take me a LONG time to read, but if you've been exposed to the culture and like learning things in great depth, then I think you'll like this book.
0783225903|5.0|This movie is w i l d!  Terry Gilliam is a genius director!  Each actors performance is spot on!  If you saw this on TV, you may have seen a HIGHLY edited ending, which completely reverses the intent of the original.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|This game has decent quality graphics. It definitely keeps you entertained and it also helps that it has a interesting story line.
B00CDSVZHY|3.0|Was not the type of western I was use to watching, but in some areas informative and maybe more realistic with a little less violence.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is a must read for those who are doubting the existence of God. Well written and easy to read.
B000FC13Y0|4.0|Just enough myth to take you to the corners of you mind you have bothered to shake up lately.  Very enjoyable read.
B005DOKM9M|4.0|Nice!!!! Fits like a glove.  Outstanding product. Keep up the good work, makes you want to use the Kindle more.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|One of Disney's best animated features!  He turned it into a ride at Disneyland  As usual, the artistic level is very high.  I particularly like the background when Peter and the kids are flying over London.  A must have for a complete collection.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Completely changed how this reasearcher/ list-maker/ organizing nerd/ window-shopper/ homemaker/ DIY-er approaches everything!  Amazing to have access to so much creativity.
B001EC0OMM|5.0|This movie is funny, the story line very easy to follow.  I am a big fan of Cary Grant, K. Hepburn, Jimmie Stewart and others.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son loves this app he builds things and I like that he is using his imagination to be creative.
B002KYGLVQ|5.0|This movie is all about the character V and his willingness to go the distance to wake up the British people of the wrongs of their government.  Slowly he wins over a girl, who endures torture and realizes the truth.
B004JN1D2I|2.0|Very hard to maneuver through this collection on a Kindle.  The Books are not separated and read as if one long book.  I had already read the first book and had a hard time trying to find the second book and where it started.
B0007PALZ2|5.0|Not only is Bruce Willis great in this film, it's a great film, period!  Terry Gilliam strikes again!!  AND ya get to see Brad Pitt's naked butt!
B008TRH5N6|5.0|I read this book 14 years ago for the first time. Recently I decided to read it again and remembered that I had given my copy away. I downloaded it, and couldn't stop reading. Very eye opening! Great book
B00E8B1P9M|5.0|Great action great pace all around great movie Bruce Willis the rock make a great combo for a movie g
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|Never got into this version. Seemed disjointed and not really up to par. In fact only got just over half way through and started falling asleep it was that boring.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I loved every page of it! I loved all the plot twists in the book! It will keep readers up all night dying to finish it
B0036TGT3E|5.0|Great movie. Great quality. This is simply a classic. A must have in your collection for children and adults alike.
0783229526|5.0|This may be my favorite performance by Johnny Depp.  A very close second would be Edward Scissorhands, but the roles are SO different it's difficult to compare.  Terry Gilliam is a master director!
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|This app is nice. Sometimes I wonder if it is doing what it is suppose to do because I still have some crap left over.
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|Bought this for my daughter as she loved the Band Perry.  Turns out I really like them also.  Excellent purchase
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I'm not a big fan of Zombies. That said, I was totally sucked in! The way the author describes the start of the crisis and how governments around the world responded strikes too close to home for comfort. The Zombies are relentless and mankind's response is almost unequal to the task. There's no way the movie can do this book justice!<br /><br />Steve
B00008DDHZ|4.0|Very good film. True to both sides involved. A must for those interested in irish history. Special features are very good as well.
B00E25RD68|5.0|Best revenge movie of all time.  A must see, with one of the most mind blowing endings ever put on film.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|My own mind was not in the correct state to devour this book as I suspect it deserves.  I am not certain what I mean by that, but I decline to give the author a bad review.  A friend once told me of another who kept this sign posted in his office where only he could read it while talking or negotiating with others.  It read, \\"NO DOUBT THE PROBLEM LIES WITH YOU\\" ... I think this is true in this case ... the book is great, my brain was not up to it at this moment.  Maybe another time.
B005V5WBFG|1.0|I got this and was told it was in the cloud but I could not find it. I don't know if it is good or not. I could not download it. I want something I can get down loaded when I get it
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was a good read once it got going. A lot more detail than the movie had which I liked.
B000MRTGW4|5.0|We bought this as a cake topper for my son's birthday party.  It looks great and fits right in with all the other high quality animals put out by Schleich.
B0092SQ5EG|4.0|Great movie. You see a hard working young gal, full of dreams.  You also see her vulnerable side.  Every aspect of life doesn't always turn out like the the fairy tale one hopes for, but you keep on, and hold on  - sometimes people just aren't a fit in this chapter of life.  But chapters close and new ones begin.  God may have a perfect fit for you further on in life.  I like Perry's gumption and character - a brave young lady.
B004GXZ69W|5.0|Got this mouse after being diagnosed with Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and \\"mouse arm\\". I must say it really changed the way I work. It took me a few days to adjust to it, but this is the position your arm should stay in (not horizontally).
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|While the script was somewhat simple, one must remember that this is an action film, not a drama.  That said, I enjoyed the story anyway.  Sometimes, I need simple.  The bad &#34;guy&#34; is two dimensional and so not on the list of awesome bad guys, but still.  I've seen worse!  There are great effects, particularly when showing the sensations of using the drug in the film. Dredd was great, better than Stallone's version, and I liked the addition of the girl that was both a foil for Dredd's seriousness and a hero in her own right.  I enjoyed it and will revisit it when I want more blow em up action.  If you want to see stuff explode, then you've come to the right place! Very visually striking
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Some challenging levels. But overall a good brain teaser. I would recommend playing this game. Just keep clicking around and look at everything.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Pretty good overall. Not that compelling of a plot but the characters are interesting. It was a good start for what I'm sure is a franchise project.
B0093X80VQ|1.0|I enjoy Roald Dahl stories, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is certainly a favorite of mine. Published in 1972, the first part clearly was influenced by the at-that-time recent Apollo missions. This would not have been a bad thing per se, but the story he chose to tell as Charlie and company were in space was, simply put, boring. Here he had this wonderful opportunity with the space hotel to create another fantastic environment for adventure and amazing things to happen and instead he gives us a boring hotel in space and a goofy president of the United States. Some of the characters, such the grandparents, were not written the same was the first book and were instead whining the whole time. In the end, this book adds nothing to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. It reads as a completely different story with Charlie and the gang inserted into it as an afterthought.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|the game is fun and doent have any issues as of yet. fun game over all no crashing or freezing
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I always like prequels better than sequels.  Learning more about the characters and how they came to be is always interesting to me.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|I read the book because my daughter had to read it for school.  I thought it would be too mature for her but it was not. The author kept your attention by telling the stories through the cassette tapes - Brilliant idea!<br />Great story and makes you think about how we treat people.
1781162646|5.0|Another Stephen King book, again I have not had a chance to read this one but that's what winters are for. As a collector of Stephen King books and movies, I try to buy all his works.
B002N1AF8G|5.0|The only Kraftwerk recording that I've never had.<br />It was well worth the wait.<br />I highly recommend it to old and new fans of Kraftwerk.
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|This book has been incorrectly promoted.  I expected the reunion of two people who had at one time meant quite a lot to each other, though in ways the reader doesn't know.  But the book is actually about the nasty intersection of our own world with other worlds.  I am not interested in the occult, and didn't want to read about it.<br /><br />I should mention that I did enjoy the heroine, about whom one learns very little in the course of the book.  Another disappointment
0385737955|5.0|Okay, so when i started to read it, i had really low expectations but then.... Oh, my god! THIS BOOK RIGHT HERE IS AWESOME!!!! I haven't been sucked into a book after reading the hunger games trilogy and divergent and insurgent, which are my favorites! And this book right here, along with the series is freaking awesome! Dont give it a second thought! This is a page-turner, and at the end of every chapter, something incredible happens that makes you want to read more! I COULDN'T PUT THIS BOOKS DOWN. If you LOVE DIVERGEBT AND THE HUNGER GAMES, THEN THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU!
B005544TRQ|5.0|I like the writing of the show and it's expert direction.  I work at a law firm and there are so many quirks, egos and competition among peers in the legal profession as well as testosterone and estrogen colliding on a daily basis.  Love the set up with Mike Ross as an extraordinary intellect that becomes the protege of an astute and accomplished lawyer.  Even though Mike Ross is perpetrating a fraud you root for this guy because you believe he's in it for the right reasons which means he practices law with a heart.  Can't say enough about this show.  It is superb from the story lines to the power suits and Rita Torres is fabulous in her role as owner of the firm.  Love how feisty and deliberate she is.  If you haven't seen it I highly recommend you do!
B005CRQ2IU|4.0|This book was very fun and easy to read. Believe it or not; I actually read this in my english class and it was very enjoyable!
B001K3KK0Q|4.0|I was told the older version (1974) was better than the newer one. Haven't seen the version Starring Leonardo Dicaprio but I enjoyed this one!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Makes life an adventure. More wonderful than anything else i have read this year.recommended to all of my family and friends.
034554398X|4.0|In my view Mr. Martin is fascinated by the workings of power and also a VERY good story teller.  We are the benefactors of his talent, skill, and hard work.  My husband and I and reading the Song of Ice and Fire together.  We are on the third book, and our interest is, if anything, increasing as the story goes on.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|the story, first. the incredible graphics.  the celebration of youth. the use of magic. I love all of Disney's obvious underage, princesses.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|if you are not hooked on this series, i don't know why.  it is full of history and drama.  it balances the upper class and the service people very well.  it is a good look at how people lived in the uk....i especially like the uk versions.
B00007GZQZ|4.0|Very funny and enjoyable comedy.  No matter how many times I've  seen this movie it still makes me laugh.  Tom Hanks is great in<br />his role.
159463176X|4.0|Haven't read it yet but the book is in perfect condition...I'm sure when I finally have time to read it, I'll love it!
1250029465|5.0|I found out about James Bowen and his Wonderful cat Bob by accident, while in my local bookshop early this years I stumbled across this Touching, Honest and Heart-warming book. Here we experience London street live and drug addiction in brutal honesty Bowen never tries to hide his mistakes. However when it seems like life has little left to offer an injured cat shows up and the pair become inseparable. Each one down and out in a cold unfeeling city in times were human compassion is in short supply. There journey together is not only remarkable but uplifting and reviling. This book touches on so many social issues such as homelessness and unwanted animals, who are all to quickly cast out and shunned by society as lost causes but through this beautiful well writen book we see just how much these two outcast have to offer. In it's 279 pages we are invited on bus and tram journeys, days of busking, and a unique insight into how The Big Issue works. A well rounder book of triumph over adversity. I highly recommend this book.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Love playing this game. I spend hours beating this game.  Even have my grandchildren playing MAhjong.  They are great at playing this game.  The three of us wile away the<br />Afternoons playing.  I would highly recommend Mahjong to everyone.
B008ALA6DW|1.0|Genuine Apple products have a little Apple logo on them. This one does not, even though it is priced at $29.00 - the same as the Apple store. After six months it stopped working. While it was working, it was great, but having it fail just before having to do a software demonstration was distressing. Don't buy this product. Get the real thing.
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|Filler games are those that fill time either when waiting for guests to arrive or when you only have a short time to game.  Love Letter, as stated above, is my favorite filler game.  Not only is it extremely compact and inexpensive, the mere 16 cards it uses have led to more outbursts and hilarity than I would have ever imagined.  Whether its the ridiculous blind-sniping with Guards, or Prince-ing your friend into discarding their coveted Princess, this game is a whole lot of fun into such a small package.  Highly recommended.
1419705644|5.0|One day my nephew invited me watch this toon, and i really liked, all the concept of the history and the way is presented, then i ordered the book, and what an amazing way to get you into the history, it answer a lot of questions an let you with hunger fo more of this, the illustrations are awesome, i really recomend it
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Great writing, very thought provoking.  The question is do we have choices, are we predestined.  How much do our genes have to do with how we live our life's.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|I WOULD SUGGEST THIS TO ALL. IT REALLY IS A GREAT PASSTIME.ONCE YOU START IT IS VERY HARD TO STOP PLAYING
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I had been hearing about this series for a long time, so when the movie came out I decided to go see what all the fuss was about. The movie wasn't bad but I had so many questions during and after about certain details. So I quickly finished the book I was reading and downloaded City of Bones! I loved it and I think it helped me enjoy and understand it more because I had already seen the characters come to life on the big screen. I already had favorites and it was nice to put a face with the name. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and am anxious to see what will happen in City of Ashes!
B00C0UHGLO|1.0|I hated this game, I could not make heads or tails how to play so I got rid of it. Did not make my day just wasted my time.
B005J4ASDG|5.0|I'm a big fan of Howard Shore's score from the original movies. This symphony recording in 6 movements was absolutely beautiful. I listen to it all the time! A definite recommendation for anyone who loves orchestral music!
B00009Y3L4|5.0|Great film.  Very dark in many ways, but a good balance of music, humor, and real life.  I really like it.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I enjoyed the book.  Well written and touching.  It made me smile and cry.  A must read.  I plan to suggest to my bookclub
1885167776|5.0|I heard Gary speak before I bought the noon and I was blown away..the ideas he spoke on and that in the book are simple and broken down beautifully to follow. I loved so many ideas but the one that I'm going to implement in 2014 is schedule my vacation days (1, 3, 10 days) around my work schedule. Thanks Gary..keep up the great work!!
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|I like certain tracks on this album, but maybe I'm just not really into dance/house music.  I like the track they play on the radio &#34;suit and tie&#34; and some of the other tracks are enjoyable, but some of them also just feel like they drag on and on (7 or 8 minutes).  They are really repetitive and have trouble keeping my interest.  Perhaps I need to try listening to it again while under the influence of various substances that are legal in my state.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I almost didn't get this game because of the negative reviews.  I'm glad I chose to see for myself.  I've been playing for a few days now and I've not spent a penny yet.  This game lets your energy renew within a few hours, so you can continue where you were.  If you accept the challenges and succeed, you get more energy.  It tests your memory and provides a fun time (although frustrating as well).  I enjoy this in my spare time.  Check it out for yourself.  You can always uninstall it if you don't like it.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|I didn't see Firefly when it was on TV and I'm really sorry.  It has great story telling, an art lacking in TV and movies.
1401301010|5.0|A fun and engrossing autobio of Anthony Kiedis (of the Red Hot Chili Peppers); a rip rollicking account of his astronomical rise to stardom and heavy addiction to drugs, this book kept my husband up until the wee hours of morning reading each delicious page after another.  The vendor was prompt professional and book delivered immediately.
B003JHKORK|5.0|I loved how they went to introduce Percy, how he got to know who he is. The music was perfect and enjoyed seen the movie multiple times. A must to own, I own not only the DVD but also have it on Digital. So never to not with out Percy Jackson.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I could not put this book down! I was hooked from the first chapter. I really enjoyed the way it was told as well.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This is an amazing performance and album.  I listened to it on my hifi system and noticed layers of subtlety that you just don't hear on the radio.  I can definitely see why she won so many awards for this.
098555780X|5.0|Excellent. Everything is easy to understand. I am finding that it's easy to do a lot of other things. Thanks
B00821PCJS|4.0|If you can get over the cliché that a race that can travel to other stars, has war robots and is capable of telepathic communication can only track humans via sound and large heat signitures, nor can the contend with an insurgency of said humans, then it is a compelling show with fairly interesting characters.
B000I0XLYO|1.0|this movie was very aweful. very obnoxious. not memorable at all. really did not like it, very poor plot/story line.
B00CO4KGYA|3.0|Its fun for a bit. Gets old quick though.  There are some funny jokes but much of the game feels just like another angry birds rip.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|The author's style of writing appeals to me.  While I felt like a knew the truth throughout the book, the surprise ending and the build up from the beginning held my interest all the way through.  Definitely a page turner.  I will read it again when I retire so that I will not be interrupted by the call of &#34;work.&#34;
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|A blast from the past. I really enjoyed the music and memories.  Dave Grohl is a chill guy.  Enjoy it!
6305882592|5.0|RX: watch once daily to instill joy and optimism in your life. A classic that still holds up. Maude may be the best role model for humanity yet.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|its challenging but doable. I haven't been able to do other escape games but this one is cool. looking forward to more levels.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I am not usually a Sci-fi fan, but I was instantly hooked and could NOT put it down! I think I flew through both  series (this one as well as the Shadow Series) in under a week. My wallet didn't like it, but I absolutely did!
B003G4W49C|5.0|What a good read, so many surprises. Great feeling characters with gritt and depth.  Definitely worth the read, stayed up most of the night to finnish it.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|this movie is a keeper for me--it was loaned to me by a friend and I loved it so much I bought my own copy--the songs were fantastic and I thought the acting was great
B00AYE8C70|1.0|After installing it seemed to work until it tried to sync all my contacts. It went on for over an hour.  I then tried to text a friend not using Viber and it tried to reroute all my texting via Viber.  Absolute pain. I had to uninstall.  I got Viber to keep in contact with someone overseas.
B00000DHTF|5.0|A long overdue (when it came out) response by Bruce to the countless bootlegs of his unreleased studio outtakes and demos.  He added musically to some of the original recordings and mixed all the tracks properly (with Toby Scott, his chief recording engineer and three sets of engineers) producing superior recorded versions to those that had been previously circulating amongst collectors.  Collectors and fans will no doubt disagree about what he included and excluded, but overall well worth purchasing for anyone remotely interested in his musical career and songwriting.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|I love the assortment of fascinating and well written stories about the multitude of topics that grab my interest. This is my magazine when I am on the move.
B007P6VLRS|2.0|I like the band, however this album never rocks not even one song. I can not recommend this album. Watched band on guitar center sessions, That music I loved, were can I get that music.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|It works great! You can always use an extra alarm clock &amp; it helps out a lot. I use my cellphone a lot for my alarm  and I lost my phone, so this is perfect and I will download it on my cellphone when I find it!! Great App People! It's a must have!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put it down! A real page turner! What else can I say? Every good review you've read about this book is true. I'm starting to read Flynn's first two novels TODAY!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Very entertaining. Thoroughly enjoyed the story line. Great way to pass time. Slightly addicting. Graphics were good and the game overall runs well on the kindle fire
B009NOVCTM|5.0|I love this 3 CD set........great tunes by the greatest rock and roll band ever, long live The Rolling Stones!
B003Y6EL5W|4.0|Good, Fun and unexpected movie, that should be able to give you more than one laugh and shrill<br />To Watch
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|Okay, not great but entertaining.  Acting was not to good, didn't really have much of a direction either.  Would not recommend.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Dexter is an excellent series and this was listed at a reasonable price, it was exactly what I wanted and I would definitely buy from this sender again!
B00CEZJT2E|5.0|Immediately after the Slim3 was delivered it went with me on a roadtrip that I knew I'd have to rely on external power.  It worked great and I'm able to charge not only my phone, but several of my friends' phones as well given the high capacity.  The slim profile and built in micro usb cable make it extremely convenient to slip into a pocket and go.<br /><br />I hate leaving home for the afternoon without it!
B003QTWR08|5.0|Great storyline, plus added &#34;human&#34; elements throughout the movie that it that much more enjoyable.  WALL-E is one of the more feel good movies in a long time!
B00111YM5G|5.0|Loved it, Andy was such a good actor, What a loss. Really loved him in the Spartacus series, it really is not he same without him.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Really action packed movie. If you like action or sci fi movies than this one is for you. I'm not a big fan of 3-D but it's there if you like it. Turn up your surround sound, turn down the lights and enjoy.
B001P3SA94|5.0|This movie is reality displaying the many dynamics of relationships, as well as how life is influenced by the people and things you engage with.  Heart wrenching at times, but always entertaining.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|RED was a great movie and this was a great price for it. It came in a timely fashion I would definitely purchase from this sender again!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Loved the ending ! Kept my attention the whole time. Highly recommend it for a book club read. Very thought provoking
B008KOTNVA|5.0|This is a very comprehensive selection of bits with two nice drivers, essentially everything you will need for dealing with electronics.  I've yet to encounter a screw in a computer that I haven't had the correct bit for.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|The minions are hilarious! My kids loved this movie & the storyline was unique. I hope they make a third movie.
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|Movie insulted my intelligence would not recommend for people that like to use their mind movie should of been way better, had potential then ruined at the end.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I love it - but sometimes it is more soap opera than I like, and sometimes a little too worshipful of money and power. Other than that - can't wait to see the next installment!
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|This is a really good game I recommend this game to all...a great time passer.I really really love it...didn't think.that I was going to like but I do but am also paying it on a kindle fire...Don't know what it's look like on a phone.
B00E0MCYPS|4.0|was looking for a game to help me pass the time when waiting at the DMV . what a fun game to play when watching kids take their drivers tests....
B004G600A4|5.0|This movie is one of my granddaughter's favorites.  It can keep her busy for hours watching it over and over again!!

B002ZM74Y6|5.0|This is one of my favorite gangster movies. I have seen This movie so many times And it still Is so entertaining.
1416960953|5.0|If you enjoyed the Spiderwick Chronicles, you'll enjoy this book.  It's got a ton of information and illustrations that relate to the book series.  My son (age 7) loves it.  He pores over it quite often.  He enjoys nonfiction works about dinosaurs, ocean-life, machines, planets, etc.  It's like a fiction version of a reference book.  Fun!
B003W9JELC|5.0|It is such a great movie!! I have always enjoyed it and i never get tired of watching it!!!! I highly request it to anyone who loves Disney.
B000HAB4KS|5.0|We haven't watched this for a decade and decided to watch it again.  It was really fun seeing in again now that technology has changed.  Still a great ride.
B00A8KJK7G|5.0|Frankenweenie is an excellent movie, first sad then enchanting.  I have a dog.  But anybody that likes a funny movie would enjoy it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book will always keep you on your toes! Even if you've watched the movie, you be kept on the edge of your seat since the movie doesn't contain nearly a third of the action and suspense.
B00275EHJG|5.0|I didn't think I would be a fan of cartoon movies but after watching Toy Story with my grandson, I couldn't wait to see what happened in the following movies! Such cute movies with story lines anyone will enjoy.

B00009RDGA|5.0|This movie is untraditional and very unpredictable but great to watch. It's funny, cute, and lovable at the same time!
B00D7JGL36|5.0|If there were more stars I would award this CD (Album) as many as I could. If you like classic country you can not do better than Vince Gill and Paul Franklin doing what they do at their very best.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I did enjoy reading this book. Therefore, I think I may go and get some of her other novels :)
B001E9641K|5.0|This is the second TTR set we have purchased and we have really enjoyed playing it.  Our first TTR was the USA version, which we have absolutely loved.  The TTR Nordic countries adds a new dynamic to the game, which is ferries and tunnels.  There are several rule changes to the way you can use train tickets, and we have discovered that sometimes you will get color starved looking for cards to complete your routes.  We find ourselves playing this version just as much as we do the USA one, which says a lot.  Our game play is somewhat slower with this version, but I know that as we get more familiar with the game, the speed will come!  As a side note, I am a sucker for Winter related items, and the Nordic countries version has snow covered tickets and snow trains with holly berry accents!  It is gorgeous! I know we will be playing this come Christmas at family gatherings!
B006M4F67A|5.0|This is the best game that I've played I always play this games but this one is the best one.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|It just works for me. I've used it on my computer and I trust it will take me where I want to go.
B008602KQI|5.0|This is one I could watch over and over. Great story. Great acting. No wonder the film won so many awards!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|great app for pic finding. engaging story line and easy to come back to if too busy to sit down and play through multiple quests.
B00E3VTR1K|5.0|This was an incredible read... what a rollercoaster of emotions! It's full of love and passion. I'm sorry I finished it. These are truly entertaining tales that really draw you in. I was swept away by the characters. So much imagination!
B004DMIIVO|5.0|After hearing my friend rave about this movie, I decided to give it a shot and order it. The movie itself was amazing and the condition it was in was perfect. Even if you're not a fan of anime, and especially if you're a fan of immaculate animation.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have two little kids and a full-time job, so my time to read is scarce and precious to me. This saga is addictive, so well-written and unlike anything else out there. I'm not usually a science fiction fan, but this is the best book I have read in years! Can't wait to start Shift!
B0070ZLZ1G|4.0|Another book that I think all who live or work with children should read. It does a great job of explaining a great deal of what we are all dealing with today.
B00DGKQF2S|5.0|Album of the year, hands down. Expected it to be self-indulgent. Ends up being a well played collection of blues based hard rock. Richie Kotzen's voice has a very Warren Haynes type growl. Hope these guys stay together.
B00498YZH8|4.0|It is a very intense, realistic and suspenseful movie. Jennifer Lawrence's performance is great, and all the supporting players are totally believable.
1401307450|5.0|It's an amazing eye opener, seeing how this dude lived his life.. Really nice read and for me it was a really funny book :) You'll enjoy it
B0061JPYX2|5.0|There are moments that come to me when no other song can do to my head what certain Amy songs can do. In my minds eye I see her young and vibrant singing Best Friends Right but then somewhere in the shadows, a much darker place, I hear her singing I Wake Up Alone. I remember being young again when I hear F Me Pumps and realize those days are behind me when I hear her sing Our Day Will Come or Girl From Iponema. I am truly saddened by her passing. I do believe there is something else after this life. It is there I hope she is once again young and vibrant.
B000I8G5B2|4.0|Interesting view on the future of genetic science and how discrimination can apply to anything, although we try to fight it we simply end up better at hiding from it.
B003U4ZQRK|4.0|This season was good, just not great. I enjoyed previous seasons more. Looking forward to see who and when they get off the island.
B002SGYPS2|4.0|So, I... being late to the party, never saw the Truman show. When I finally did get around to seeing it in 2013, I realized that this show has become the most accurate representation of our current reality.<br /><br />I mean, back when this movie was made. Who really thought that there would be a time when a camera crew would follow someone around 24/7. From the time they wake up, use the bathroom, until the time they go to sleep. Obviously this movie has gone to extremes, but I honestly wouldn't be surprised if this happened in our lifetime.<br /><br />Anyway, should you watch the movie? Let's go into what was good and not so good about the Truman show.<br /><br />Good:<br /><br />- Very accurate portrayal of what our reality is like now. When this movie came out, this concept seemed far-fetched. Not anymore.<br />- Jim Carrey does a great job of NOT hamming it up. He has some moments where he slips into his goofiness, but he plays it straight through most of the movie.<br />- The acting and pacing is nicely done. There are really no boring moments in the movie.<br />- The antagonist is very interesting. You can't quite tell if he's looking out for Truman, loves him, or just wants him for the ratings.<br /><br />My favorite line has to be from Carrey in one of the few moments where he hams it up. &#34;Is that the best you got? Ha ha ha ha ha! I guess you're just going to have to... KILL ME!&#34;<br /><br />Bad:<br /><br />The only one I could think of is that it's definitely dated. As the years progress, this movie will not age well.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie and really couldn't find many negative things to say about it. I can't say I &#34;loved&#34; the movie, but I definitely did enjoy watching it.
B0032O6S4I|5.0|Very nice. Exccelent product, The zoo has it all. It is beautifull and perfect done. The quality is as excellent. Playmobil knows how to do it.
B00ATP24SW|4.0|This is an honest review regarding the latest album to my favorite band. Off the bat, this is my least favorite Post-Tolkki Stratovarius album. That's not to say that this album is any bad because it has some great tracks but I really thought the album would be more heavier and darker because of the name and artwork. My big problem is that there isn't a big contribution like the last two albums. In Polaris, everybody did 3 tracks that made it into the album (except for the drummer), this time around Matias and Kotipelto do the majority of the music which is not bad but I would like to here more Johansson and definitely more Porra. My favorite tracks would have to be Unbreakable, Stand My Ground, Halcyon Days, Fantasy, Castles in the Air, and Nemesis. My top track being Castles in the Air. With the different lineup, I would really like to see an instrumental in the next album like Tolkki did with Stratosphere, Holy Light , etc. Worth a listen if your a Strato fan but if your getting into this band I suggest a different album like Polaris, Visions, Elements, or Infinite.
B000000XBC|5.0|i love this cd! it's not only got a lot of their hits, but, it's got some songs that some people haven't heard but are good too. i don't think anybody that would try this cd would be disappointed, especially if you're a ccr fan.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|I was very excited when I found out this game made it to the kindle. This game requires a lot of strategy and is very addictive. At times there is a lot of things moving at the same time and it slows down on the kindle fire. However, that being said, it is a great game and was well worth the dollar I paid even though i may have to wait a couple of extra seconds while I play. The game type is always changing and it keeps the game fresh and entertaining. All in all, a good game.
0345529057|5.0|Great books and great prices. Some other book store wanted $35 just for one of the books. Praise the fire god.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Nice to see some quality writing in an otherwise dull environment finally coming back to TV.  Great show well written with great acting
B00514HDNW|4.0|I am not a big fan of vampire stories, but I recently read another book from Richard Matheson that I loved, so I convinced myself to give this one a try.  I was agreeably surprised !  Pleasingly, none of the usual vampire cliche were encountered. We intensely feel the hero's loneliness throughout the book, Matheson succeeded in creating a lovable and charming character with whom you can care for and connect with.
B0091QS88K|5.0|My daughters love the Dr Panda series. Its fun, cute, and replay ability is very high. We recommend all of them.

B0057UVLQ0|1.0|I purchased these songs in mp3 for my kids.<br /><br />The mp3 files downloaded from Amazon cloud doesn't work on the MP3 player in my car, though the mp3 files work fine on my PC.<br />While many mp3 files download from Amazon cloud work fine for the same MP3 player in my car, some do have problem to recognize the file, including all mp3 songs in Selena Gomez's \\"When the sun goes down\\" and the \\"Cup Song\\" in mp3.<br /><br />It seems there is a format issue or something like that. Can anyone (from Amazon) help on this problem? Thanks.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|This product is really awesome. I really really like it. I would definitely order another one and probably will soon.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|One of the best films ever created with some of the top actors in the business.  Scorsese draws the viewer in and will keep you on your toes... not to mention the soundtrack, which features classic, nostalgic tracks like \\"Layla\\" and \\"Life is But a Dream,\\" each of which perfectly sets every scene.  Such a definitive film of the 1990s and I would consider it the greatest mob film of all time! A+++!!
B00005AR3G|5.0|I love this movie so much, and was thrilled to find it at a low price on Amazon. It arrived in great condition, and I haven't had any problems playing it on our DVD player.
B0027MJU00|2.0|I devoured Flynn's other two books, Gone Girl and Sharp Objects...they were some of the best books I've ever read suspense wise.  I couldn't put these two books down. So I was looking forward to Dark Places being equally as engrossing...boy was I wrong!  I struggled to finish the book...it dragged on and on and was simply boring. I didn't like any of the main characters. I wished Flynn hadn't jumped from one person's perspective to the other.  The twists in this book weren't as great as in the other 2 books and the ending felt wrong like she was in a hurry.  I'm hoping Flynn goes back to writing novels that echo the greatness of her other two books.  I'm still a fan even though I hated this one!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Very good instructions.  Down to earth...no high falutin' text here!!  Exercises you can relate to and do!  I would highly recommend this book to anyone trying to use their energy wisely.
B004132HZS|5.0|This product is really awesome. I really really like it. I would definitely order another one and probably will soon.
B008JFUO36|5.0|DVD arrived on time. Packaging was good. This was purchased as a gift. I'm happy with this purchase. Would recommend to anyone.
0345525558|5.0|I thought this was a very good book for a first novel. I hated to put it down and my friends that read it felt the same way. I look forward to her next book!
0307476073|4.0|Good story, well told. Reading the incredibly critical reviews of this woman's book, I ponder what they would have been like if Strayed was a man. She is castigated for having a sex drive and being a human being who makes mistakes and who has grappled with addictions and problems just like the rest of us.<br />The pure vitriol aimed at her book has prompted me to post this review. Strayed is a very interesting book, and Strayed is a very good writer. The sexist reviews aimed at Strayed are appalling. I imagine among her critics are people who have had abortions, done drugs, and in short been less than perfect.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|A well-known masterpiece, it is really a pleasure to be able to read it again. With Dickens's other novels. I love it.
B00CE2G3AS|5.0|If you are or were a critic in the 1980s, you hated this movie and everything about it.<br /><br />The non-critics amongst us (which is 99.995% of the civilized world) love it and adore it more than most films. In some cases, it helped (and continues to help) inspire anyone with dreams.<br /><br />OK. Jennifer Beals did not do her own dancing (done by Marie Jahan), but...who cares? Is that supposed to be necessary? Remember that Ms. Beals is playing a fictional character. She does not have to do her own dancing if she doesn't want to. It might have added to her character to do that, but it was fine the way it was done. So there!<br /><br />Admittedly, It doesn't have much of a plot. It's more of a loosely connected string of music videos. But there's enough of a story to have emotional impact for anyone going through that kind of situation (which is a great many of us).<br /><br />The fear of not having the financial and social pedigree to contribute to artistry and somehow having the courage to succeed anyway is the main theme. Beals pulls off this role and that attitude with honesty and integrity. And Giorgio Moroder's score provides the soul and feeling necessary to make this a meaningful film for millions around the world.<br /><br />The critics are full of garbage on this one (and perhaps more than that). Grab it!
B009WUBERW|4.0|Don't expect a brain teaser or tough to follow plot. This is just for fun and enjoyment. Lots of explosions. Yes, nothing can pass for real, but that's not my expectation going into this movie. For me, just the cast lineup makes it a winner for me.

B001XUH69Y|5.0|Dated, sure, but still the best movie ever. The parts that are anachronistic (the driving scene and the airplanes? could they make them look more fake?) or somewhat bizarre (Peter Lorre?) are charmingly so; the parts that are cool are cool as only Bogie could do it; the parts that are iconic are like seeing a famous landmark for the first time; you can't quite believe it's real.
0345472322|4.0|but stick with it and you'll learn lots.  Well written for business situations and parenting as well.  Worth the time invested.
B00BUCW54Q|5.0|Something different other than the Mission Impossible Movies Tom Cruse does for actions and thrills.<br />To me it had a good story line. Its almost set up like who did it. I had no idea how this movie was going to turn out, but i was glad to get a copy for myself. If you like a good thriller with Tom Cruse in it, I suggest you purchase this movie.
B00EVCD9HY|3.0|This is a continuation of her Metropolis series, but, without the Overtures and Interludes, it would be a normal Janelle Mon&aacute;e album and I'd prefer it that way. The concept, which has her playing an android character named Cindi Mayweather, is silly and seemingly pointless. The radio bits, led by the voice of an annoying DJ, are especially distractive. Not that the songs themselves are without fault.<br /><br />They are technically engaging. The songstress has a knack for crafting original music that recaptures the vibes of 1970s and 1960s soul. It's Code sounds like a lost Jackson Five ballad while Look Into My Eyes channels Lena Horne. But they don't have the memorable melodies to match. This Electric Lady, even with guest vocalists like Erykah Badu and Prince at her helm, thrives on style over substance.<br /><br />marcellee.com
B00DP3IESY|4.0|No ground breaking concepts introduced with this movie, but still an enjoyable movie if you like Sci-Fi. I've already watched it a couple of times.
B002361MLA|3.0|I loved the ideas presented on this book but it was really a slow read for me. Oprah does recommend this book and it is a good one to read pieces at a time.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Excellent show that is well worth watching and streams easily from amazon prime tv and movies. Great acting and snappy dialogue
B005544TRQ|4.0|Great series that's likes to keep things interesting and entertaining. Def. will watch the next season on my Prime account.

B0031RAOVY|5.0|A must for everyone to see!! When I initially heard of this movie with Richard Gere and a dog, I was kind of surprised. But he did a great job. Of course, Hachi is the star of the movie - a beautiful story.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This book was wonderful.  I can't believe more people have not read this. (The UNABRIDGED version). Watching the movies or musical you don't get the whole story. Yes, they are well done but the book helps you understand the characters and the story SO much more!  You get things out of it that could NEVER be explained in a movie or musical.  You have to have patience, because it is a VERY large book, but it is so worth it!  I highly recommended this for those who like Charles Dickens, H. Rider Haggard or absolutely love the movies/musical and like to read. Read all the way through. You won't regret it.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|A fantastic book about the ordinary Marine on some of the fiercest fighting seen during the Second World War.  This book isn't about the commanders and their valiant heroism or a romanticized love story. This is the pure unadulterated grisly view of a private on the front lines and his story as seen through his eyes.  Recommended for ANY member of the Armed Services!!
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|Great series that's likes to keep things interesting and entertaining. Def. will watch the next season on my Prime account.

B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Whether or not you think Jesus was truely the Son of God or just a good guy preaching in the Middle East, you'll want to check this book out. An amazing amount of research went into it. The evangalist Luke comes in for an especially hard time.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a great series! It has kept my interest from beginning to end. It is so interesting to see how life may have been like in this era. It is full of life, excitement, and of course quite the drama. It is truly a must watch.
B005G67CYA|4.0|I discovered Natalia accidentally on a music streaming service. I don't normally listen to \\"pop\\" much and \\"Lady Gaga\\" is garbage to me. I came across Natalia's 'Heaven' and wanted more, though. While most songs on 'Perfectionist' might seem simplistic pop on the first listening or two, I have eventually come to admire nearly every one of them, and at least like the rest. Natalia is not an exceptional singer, perhaps, but she uses her voice in creative ways, and while some tunes are indeed simple, it's all put and mixed together very thoughtfully. Plus yes, she has a knack for fitting and witty lyrics that are definitely above the genre's usual.
B002VECM6S|5.0|This deals with many issues and leads to excellent discussion in our Year 7 PE theory lessons. The students often do not understand the issues this raises and it allows them to explore and discuss with a more informed forum.
B0051CSI0G|3.0|These genre zombie apocalyse movies seem to be coming fast and furious these days. Not sure why the trend. This actually features vampires, or \\"vamps\\" as the hero calls them. No difference. Seems the same as zombies. But vamps need a stake through the heart to be killed, so that's what you see often here. The plot is the usual road to nowhere so common in these end of the world films. It's escapism. Some of the sets show they had a small budget, but it's mostly shot in the rural landscapes, so it didn't cost much to make. It's an ok watch.
B00DNDR29I|5.0|I'm still trying to wrap my head around The ArchArndroid, but I wholeheartedly welcome Janelle Monae's return with The Electric Lady.<br /><br />I don't usually listen to R&B, with the exception of early Motown, especially Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye. The influence of both can be heard, especially that of Stevie Wonder. If he weren't still alive, I'd say she was channeling his spirit from the great beyond for some of the songs here, both in general tone and in attitude. It's fantastic.<br /><br />Monae doesn't play by the usual rules. She's definitely not some empty shell the record companies throw out there to grab some quick money. She is the real deal. I love her high-concept approach, her use of science fiction, and the sheer variety found on her albums.<br /><br />This definitely feels like the perfect next phase after the ArchAndroid, a worthy follow-up but it can stand on its own as well. The guest musicians add a lot of flavor, but it's Monae's show at all times. \\"Dance Apocalyptic\\" alone earns this album four stars from me. Altogether, and especially within the context of this bizarre, compelling, pretty much incomprehensible story she's telling, this is instantly a modern classic.

B002XWXPC8|4.0|First, the quality of the streamed movie via Amazon Prime was great.  Good audio and video with no lags or breakup.<br /><br />This is a great sports movie from the 80's, with lots of pop references from the times.  Even if you don't like baseball, this movie is great fun, as the story revolves around taking a bunch of misfits and building a team out of them.
B00DQVSTCG|3.0|Bluray / DVD looks so soft, so instagram, the video is very filtered, and you lost sharpness doing that. The Madonna performance was awesome. Madonna´s face looks very very very SOFT and overexposed, like a thousands filters added, surely you know why. The vocals are a bit, just a bit, auto tuned. But no playback at least.<br /><br />Blame the editors.<br /><br />3.5 of 5.

B00D6GT5S8|5.0|I'm no music major, but I do know good music when I hear it.  With Kveikur, Sigur Ros returns and the biggest change seems to be the addition of distortion and to their normally melodic sound.  I love the result and listen to it quite a bit.  Pick it up if you like the preview tracks.
B00EV4EUT8|2.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br /> The dictionary tells us that the word 'contrived' is defined as \\"obviously planned or forced; artificial; strained,\\" as in a \\"a contrived story.\\" And isn't that exactly what 'The Butler' is? Contrived! Director Lee Daniels and his screenwriter Danny Strong knew that they had to create an additional, secondary story, to make the true story of Eugene Allen, the Butler who served 34 years in the White House, more dramatic. This is called 'dramatic license' and all films more or less must fudge the truth a little bit to enhance the narrative.<br /><br />Actually, two stories were created out of whole cloth, when Daniels and Strong created the fictional character of Cecil Gaines. There was the acceptable but contrived story of inventing two sons for Gaines (in reality Allen had only one). To make things more dramatic, Gaines' son Louis, ends up becoming radicalized and butting heads with his father throughout the film. In reality, Allen modestly differed with his son about politics but he never left the Washington, D.C. area. Daniels and Strong prefer to put Louis in the middle of the every significant event in the history of the civil rights movement, like a Woody Allen 'Zelig' or a Tom Hanks 'Forrest Gump.' All well and good, but I felt uncomfortable when Louis turns up at the Lorraine Motel, and is part of Martin Luther King's entourage, hours before King's assassination. More believable, is the scene where Louis is part of a college protest against a segregated lunch counter. When Louis becomes a Black Panther and later rejects the movement and goes into politics, it just feels like a lot of this stuff has been done before and in some cases better (take a look at a much more subtle, non-Hollywood indie, 'Night Catches Us', about the legacy of the Black Panther movement).<br /><br />Whether you agree creating the fictional character of 'Louis' worked, it does fit under the purview of dramatic license. The opening of this film, does not. I'm referring of course to the scene of Gaines' childhood, where a white racist rapes his mother and murders his father in broad daylight, down in a cotton field in Georgia. The whole problem with this scenario is that it never happened. The real-life Allen grew up in Virginia, not in Georgia, and never underwent such an unspeakable tragedy. It's an odious scene designed to manipulate the audience into believing that 'The Butler' overcame a tremendous psychological/emotional burden, throughout his life (the other manipulative scene is the death of Gaines' second son in Vietnam--which of course also never happened in real life!).<br /><br />If Allen (Gaines) had witnessed such a horrific event, do you really believe he would have turned out to be the compliant and also nice guy, he ended up as? Sure, it's entirely plausible that a person with that kind of history, would have to suck it up, and appear completely cooperative, while on the job. But in his home life, I hardly can imagine a person not being scarred by such a terrible event. But here, Gaines is a mild-mannered family man, who has no bitterness. Why in real life did Allen (Gaines) have no bitterness? Because, the rape and the murder never happened. There's another reason why that scene should never have been falsely attributed to a real person's biography. If you are going to remind people of the injustices of the past, especially young people, do it in a truthful way. This is not a fictional character we're dealing with--it's a real life person, who endured racism throughout his life (but not in the incendiary way it's presented here).<br /><br />The other problem with 'The Butler' is that it mostly fails to make us feel that we're watching scenes of verisimilitude, involving Gaines' interactions with the various Presidents in the White House. Why was the decision made to cast well-known actors in the roles? Obviously, the big names will draw the bigger crowd. But what if casting known names, turn your scenes into veritable Saturday Night Live skits? Almost every well-known actor fails to hit the mark. Despite the prosthetics, Robin Williams simply looks like Robin Williams attempting to play Dwight Eisenhower. James Marsden does a decent enough job as JFK, but is too young for the part. John Cusack makes Nixon into a caricature and Liev Schrieber doesn't even come close to reminding us of LBJ. While they did a passable job of making Alan Rickman, look like Ronald Reagan, he acts wooden and cannot convey Reagan's affability. What's more, Lee Daniels bias against Reagan shines through, when he fails to have Reagan explain why he opposed the apartheid regime in South Africa (whether you agree with Reagan or not, at least have the character provide some explanations, as to why he acted as he did).

The cameos by well-known actors, were a disaster and the opening scene, is appallingly manipulative. 'The Butler' is nothing more than a mediocre effort, except for an occasional dramatic moment or two, which will stick in your memory.n names, turn your scenes into veritable Saturday Night Live skits? Almost every well-known actor fails to hit the mark. Despite the prosthetics, Robin Williams simply looks like Robin Williams attempting to play Dwight Eisenhower. James Marsden does a decent enough job as JFK, but is too young for the part. John Cusack makes Nixon into a caricature and Liev Schrieber doesn't even come close to reminding us of LBJ. While they did a passable job of making Alan Rickman, look like Ronald Reagan, he acts wooden and cannot convey Reagan's affability. What's more, Lee Daniels bias against Reagan shines through, when he fails to have Reagan explain why he opposed the apartheid regime in South Africa (whether you agree with Reagan or not, at least have the character provide some explanations, as to why he acted as he did).

B000683VI4|5.0|I wanted movies to take to college this year and found this at a great price.  I love this movie.
B005LJK3AC|4.0|The cast is so funny! Not usually a Colin Farrell fan, but he is such a moron in this film that you just have to laugh! I do adore Jason Bateman and Jason Sudeikis, and they are really good together. Even Jennifer Aniston goes against her &#34;nice girl&#34; typecast and does a great job playing a witch of a boss.<br />  There is some profane language and sexual references, as well as some drug references, but the movie is based on three guys fantasizing about killing their bosses!
B008B8AOQI|5.0|I dare you to just listen to this album once.  You won't be able to.  This album is pure magic. You will listen to it over and over again like I did and do.  The lyrics, the music. Can you tell I enjoyed this album enormously?  Yep.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|It was well directed and very suspenseful with unexpected twists.  Very well acted but the plot is ultimately not believable.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I LOVE This game I'm Addicted to this game!!!! You won't be disappointed when you get this I stay up at night to play.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|As in &quot;Inspiring Awe&quot;.  This game has an elegant simplicity that cultivates a zen-like state that is not slow, but calculating and sometimes frantic.  As a game designer, I find it to be the best game I have seen on tablets.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Anything is on Utube.  What ever you want to see or hear is there.  So many people are so into this website.  Lot's of information!
B00B769XB8|5.0|Even though this didn't get very good reviews when it was first out in the theaters, I thought it was a good movie.  A LOT of action, which I like.  It kept my interest, which not all movies do.  If I don't fall asleep during a movie, I know it was good. :-)
B008469DGY|5.0|I got this game for the free app of the day and I was very happy with it. I would have paid for this game. One thing was the I would have liked to play 9 holes but it's still worth it
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love this show! I've been watching since season one.  It's very clean and family friendly.  I love the entire cast:
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|minion rush is so fun I love it I have it on both my iPhone 5 and my kindle fire hd love the game &lt;3
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked the book and the writer's style.  It was always such a surprise when a new twist was presented.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|it was ok but I would like 4 it to have more alarm sound options though it is an ok app
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Very entertaining movie, with digital copy and DVD, in case Blu-Ray player is not available.  Very nice set, highly recommended
B00EMJD6TC|5.0|I Love this movie and I'm also a huge fan of the book.  The movie was done beautifully.  Don't compare it to the book.  Just love it for its own sake.  It did bring certain elements from the book to the movie for continuity and I think of it as a prequel.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Easy to use and I can get my local stations quickly with no problems.  I am a new comer to all this, so ease of use is important.
0425263924|4.0|Personally, I enjoyed Sylvia Day's books much more than the 50 Shades of Grey series.  This book is along the same lines as 50 Shades but not nearly as sexually explicit so I would recommend the Crossfire series over the 50 Shades series.
0062255657|4.0|This book was exactly what I hoped it would be - magical, sweet, a little sad, beautiful, and entertaining.  I just wish it had lasted a little longer!
B00004WEJZ|5.0|Who doesn't love Sean Connery as James Bond?  Needed to add this one to my collection, Bond 50:  Celebrating 5 Decades of Bond.  Can't find more beautiful women than Kim Basinger and Barbara Carrera.  Max von Sydow and Klaus Maria Brandauer are superb.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|For years I've watched the film adaptation of Persuasion starring the magnificent Ciaran Hinds as Captain Wentworth and the incomparable Amanda Root as Anne.  It's my favorite Jane Austen movie.  However the book has so many little details that the movie, by its length, could not include.  I read the book about once a year.  And now I have it on Kindle.
1451696191|5.0|The book was in very good condition when I received it. Not to mention it is just a good book
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|in this version of dredd did not had the fast paced or lot of action as stallone version but it was ok but i rated it that i liked it might just see it again if it is still to stream
B007REV4T8|4.0|Daniel Craig is terrific as James Bond.  Had to have this for my James Bond collection.  Loved listening to Adele singing the title song.  Hope Daniel Craig continues in the James Bond role for many years to come.  While this movie isn't my favorite James Bond movie, it kept my attention.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|However, how can I rate an American classic like The Wizard of Oz any less than a five?  Don't expect this novel to be like reading a novelization of the movie, though, because you'll be disappointed.  The basics are there: Dorothy getting caught in a storm and whisked off to another world, but the screenwriter took liberties with L. Frank Baum's story in order to make it more colorful and exciting for film audiences.  And, of course, the movie is a musical.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Simple as that. Storytelling and excellent character development. Nearly no special effects at all. Great if you're a grownup. Not so much for ADHD children.
B00B19H2KU|5.0|this movie was pretty good it was one movie might not be high rated by criticts but i thought jeffery dean morgan and the youngest daughter was good in this movie
B006CHML4I|3.0|The best that I can say for this watch is that &#34;It's okay.&#34;  Although the case diameter is 37mm, the watch face is 27-28mm - a little smaller than anticipated.  That said, the watch dial is easily readable at a glance, the contrast of the hands and background markings with the face is quite good and the day/date windows are reasonably visible. The &#34;lume&#34; is also quite good. The nylon band &#34;is okay&#34; and is holding it's own doing yard work, outdoor activities, etc. The automatic movement &#34;is okay.&#34; Time keeping has been acceptable.  The power reserve is disappointing, however.  I've had this watch for about one month now. After a deliberate &#34;swirl&#34; of the rotor for 2-3 minutes in the morning and a full day of wearing, I have had to reset the time/date/day each subsequent morning.  Other reviewers seem to experience better with their reserve.  &#34;It's OK&#34; for the rough and tumble use that it gets and for it's price point.
B00B3N4CWK|4.0|Very interesting story line.  Casting was very good, Michael Caine was at his best.  It was very thought provoking. I would recommend this movie.
B00BDAP66E|4.0|It's a good app, I just prefer using the laptop or computer because there are more options. For a mobile app it is sufficient, though.
B000SGSU58|4.0|Like the book but took some time to get into book. Seems the first few Chapters did not hold me to keep reading
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|As someone skeptical of superhero movies and outright repulsed by most action movies, I initially greeted recommendations of Dredd with a good amount of doubt. Finally getting around to watching it, I was pleasantly surprised that the movie, if no timeless cinema classic, was decently entertaining. It avoids a lot of the common pitfalls of the genres and, though the plot is predictable, it is well told.
B00007KWHG|5.0|I had the privilege of seeing Frankie Valli in person recently and he sounded great.  This recording represents the greatness of the group and it's lead singer.  I love it!
B00D0Z2JR4|5.0|Dragon Ball Z Battle of Gods is a great DBZ film. I've really missed it. If you're planning on buying this just buy it from Amazon.Co.Jp. Go for the Limited Edition Blu Ray Steel Book Case Version. Comes with all the Limited Edition stuff + A Steel Book Exclusive only to the Amazon Site. It'll be like around $113.00 more or less. I think it's worth it. Japanese Blu Rays will work on U.S. Blu Ray players. They have the same Region Code. DvD's have different region codes and U.S. and Japan don't share the same one. Just buy it off the Japanese Amazon site on Blu Ray. That's what I did. Hope this helps. And I forgot. IT COMES OUT THIS FRIDAY!!! CAN'T WAIT TO HAVE IT!!!!!!!!
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|Finished Season 1 and on to Season 2.  Great writing with many twists and turns.  The series is a must watch.
B007IYWY3C|5.0|it was exactly what I want, so i like it a lot, i will buy more when soon i hope
B000GRPWMI|5.0|This book is a must read for anyone looking for happiness in their own life.  Simply written and very straightforward Ruiz's message is powerfully stated.  This book will change your life if you allow it to.
0316228583|1.0|If you were somehow unaware that the world can be a hard, cruel place, or you just can't get enough of reading about it in your leisure time, this is the book for you.  I can't even finish it, it was so disturbing.  Sad, sick people and their sad pitiful off spring make you go diving for the razor blades.  What a downer.  And a big disappointment from someone who has so much talent.
B005EHQGTS|5.0|I love being able to access my laptop desktop on my kindle from anywhere! So handy to have. I really like it and have found no downsides!
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Cute movie I like the actors in it, that's the whole reason I wanted to see it. I wouldn't buy it buy I might rent it again from redbox someday.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Stayed up sometiimes to 3:30 am playing catch up.  I have bags under my eyes to prove it. :-)  You won't be disappointed.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I liked this book.  I thought it was a little bit &#34;preachy&#34; towards the end...but overall a book worth reading.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Hidden objects are one of my favorite types of games. This one is pretty fun. I got it for free, and I'm not sure if it is worth the price. But I'm very cheap so other people may disagree. Sometimes where you &#34;click&#34; doesn't register correctly. All in all I like playing it.
B005N95JA4|3.0|I suppose if you are a &#34;DIEHARD&#34; Stones fanatic - you just may like it. Personally, for me it was just a so-so album. I would not recommend it to my friends. Sorry, I didn't like it much.
1616550414|5.0|Pros:<br />-This books is BIG. I love the attention of detail paid to each and every page. I have been flipping through this for a while now, and still pick out something new each time.<br />-The colors are vivid. This book was printed on high quality paper and it shows. The colored images pop off of the pages.<br />- Price. This is a tremendous value for any Zelda fan, you cannot beat the price. It makes a great gift too!<br /><br />Cons:<br />-None that I can think of at the moment. It was wrapped in a plastic cover to protect during shipping. No flaws at all!
B009G41CG2|3.0|the game is ok, but the writing on the screen is so small that it is hard to read and as such, I play it seldom.
B009T8XBBO|5.0|I couldn't put my kindle down until I beat this. This is not normally a game I would play, but it was done so well. I really enjoyed playing it and I hope they come out with more games like it.
B00B1E6DEQ|3.0|It's just not the same as their previous album.  It seems too modern for me, not enough grit and rock and roll element.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The title of the book caught my attention.  The characters were so believable as was the story line.  Great job.
B00AECGQF2|4.0|My daughter loves creating and designing diferent styles on this app! Great effects on this and good purchase!<br />Love it!
B00280LYIM|5.0|Great story line! Kept me interested in the whole book. I loved this whole series of books!!! Anyone wanting a light reading these books are perfect for that
B00992CF6W|4.0|Minecraft needs wolf's and more animals and caves O and slim and enchantment tables and flint and steel on creative.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|I have not had a lot of chances to use this item but it does sharpen serrated knives well.  It is smaller than I expected it to be but that does not really inhibit it's function.
0736063684|5.0|Anyone who participates in any sport, weight trains, performs aerobics, yoga, pilates, etc. needs to have a copy of this book.  The information within is invaluable to your overall health and fitness.  I have lifted weights for years, without always fully knowing which muscles I am targeting (or intending to target).  This has helped me to focus my workouts, and end wasted motion.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|This series is definatley for adult audiences.  The detail of the battles is incredible. The whole story keeps you on your toes.  There are twists and turns around every bend.  Many surprises.
B007LB5MF4|1.0|I had to send it back. I wanted and EBOOK to read on my kindle. the description on the book was confusing . If I had known it was a comic book I would never have ordered it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Addicted to it! Suspenseful, drama, scary. I get attached to the characters and don't want to see anything happens to them.
B004EPZ0AC|4.0|My kids liked the movie.....not as well as Happy Feet, but still good.  The DVD was in great shape as well.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|We learned about the series during season 3 so had to buy the first two seasons.  The show is addictive.  There are so many characters it took us a while to see who belongs to what family.  The &#34;Family Tree&#34; in with the DVD is a help.  The costumes are very accurate for the time period.  Throughly enjoyable.
B00CWEQ62S|1.0|I wanted an EBOOK I could read, this was not what I wanted. The decription was very confusing. I would never have ordered this book if I had known it was a comic. Had to send it back.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Fantastic book. It was difficult to put down.  If I had any dislike it would be the ending. Will buy this writer again.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|I can't wait to read Pretties!! Uglies was like SO bubbly!! Lol, anyway it was an awesome book. I really hope the author writes more books!!!!!!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Best book I ever read that was filled with both drama and action<br />I love how rick Jordan captures every single demigod in this book and in all of his heroes of Olympus and kane chronicle books
B000NGTJTY|5.0|The movie has great actors who do their job splendidly; the action moves along at a tense pace; and the ending is quite unexpected.
B008PZZV8S|5.0|This was an enjoyable thriller, great movie. Loved the way it kept you so interested. Quite enjoyable and Matt Damon was terrific.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Interesting but very slow to evolve. A bit long winded as well but, overall, an entertaining movie. Check it out!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I would recommned this product to everyone. I have really enjoyed reading this book and would read it again and again. I have begun to read his other books as well.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|Nice weaving of multiple plots and hints as to the motive and culprit.  Lots of good action using believable details,  furthering my appetite to read.  My favorite of DeMille's work.
B001UTW7QU|3.0|The video is good, but where's the good audio.  I'm sure this was at 5.1 audio, but streaming, I only get dolby pro-logic.<br />What's up
B000PUV1ZI|5.0|By far one of my favorite movies of all time. Robin Williams makes an amazing Peter Pan. I could watch it a 1000 times over.
0547258305|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. Katsa is such a powerful character. She is tough and has depth and her abilities are so cool. I love when a book has a strong female character who doesn't need anyone to \\"save\\" her. Highly recommend!
B007C94XG4|3.0|As an adult I actually enjoyed the first two Alvin and The Chipmunks movies but this one was just too cheesy. I laughed at some parts, but only 'cause I was laughing at how cheesy the part was not that I was laughing at the actually joke. It also tried to go too modern with the music the chipmunks sang, our daughter didn't know the music. Our daughter got bored in the middle of the movie and started playing with her toys instead. She can watch a movie all the way through if she likes it.
B009MYARIK|3.0|This was a quick--purely entertainment. Lots of one-dimensional characters, but the story, though predictable, will probably keep you humored for the day or two it takes to get through this. Best for easy, quick, non-taxing ready.
B005BY3XHC|5.0|Great book! Would recommend to anyone. You don't need to practice Buddhism to want to enlighten yourself or learn ways of giving back, not just in action but in thought too. A positive mind gives positive energy!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Thank you, Gameloft, for developing this game! Keeps my daughter busy when we're standing in line at the grocery store or on long car rides.
0061537934|5.0|I have given this book to almost everyone I know, and everyone has loved it as much as I did.
0547564651|3.0|If you are looking for parenting \\"how-tos\\" this is NOT the book.  The book contains several stories about people and their struggles.  The author did cite research and studies; however, in my opinion, the author didn't connect the findings to what one can do to help their child or student succeed.
B000W91RUG|5.0|A show that is worth watching. I am sure most who have seen this show can say the same. Sheldon is my favorite! Lol
B00B9B4IYI|5.0|This works perfect and I use it for my Ipad and Iphone for my yamaha Rx-v1900.  It's small and stays out of the way.
B006I1OB0U|5.0|We enjoyed the Christmas special and loved the costumes and period touches. It also tied together seasons two and three nicely. A fun watch.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Enjoyed gathering more information about the history of the program and the continued drama at Dawnton Abbey.  A great show!
1594744769|5.0|This adorable tale of all those &#34;different&#34; children is one I'll read again and again. From Mitch the mischievous invisible boy to the adorable floating little girl I found tese characters completely loveable and I wanted to hug each and every one of them.
0792839749|4.0|Cute movie.  Our grandkids loved it.  I did too considering so many of the movies out today which are so violent.
B00932A4XE|4.0|Since it was based on a well reviewed book I was interested to see how it was as a movie.  I enjoyed it a lot.  It was very entertaining and made light of the not-so-glamorous side of trying to conceive and pregnancy. The comedy that interjected into the film was perfect, not over the top and just enough to make light of the seriousness.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Incredibly well-written page turner. Great narrative voices and very vivid descriptions. I finished it in 2 days and bought a copy for a close friend. Excellent summer and plane reading!
B00005N6KG|2.0|I would give it a three star rating; however, the left speaker just stopped working.  I have had these for nine months and have not abused them.  Looking at the reviews, I found out that this is a known problem with these headphones and that they have been discontinued.  Usually I would have caught this on the front end as I try to thoroughly read the reviews before purchasing anything.  In addition, they look like over the ear, like Scoshe, but they are not.  They are over the head, with the speakers resting in the ear and facing forward so that the full volume is not directed into the ear like ear buds, but past the ear.  While this is a satisfactory method of delivering the music, I found that this design coupled with the over the head style, kept them from staying firm on my head.  They often shifted or fell off when I bent over when doing exercises.  I would not recommend them; go with the Scoshe over the ear headphones instead.
B00EY8A6BC|1.0|I was excited to watch this, rented it and could not concentrate on the movie because the quality was worse than an old bootleg movie. I should also point out that have very fast internet speeds.
B00006GFAB|5.0|This CD is named appropriately - it is &#34;The Very Best of Kiss!&#34;  I love every song and they bring back fond memories!
B00BMR5HOO|3.0|I found this to be an accurate app for the weather, but I like TWC app better for my tastes.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|this show really pulled me in.  Good story line, great character development and acting.  Just wish they wouldn't kill off some of my favorite characters.
B00A0ABQLM|3.0|I have received the ANKER USB 3.0 Gigabit Ethernet adaptor (In my case black).<br />I connected in my ultrabook S3 aspire, with windows8 x64, drivers regconize inmediately the adapter. So far so good.<br />When I tried to connect the UTP CAT 6 the RJ45 jack does not hook up into the female connector (Does not do the RJ45 clip sound).<br />So the RJ45 is released and disconnects if you don't hold with the hand.<br />I'm very frustrated with this, the adaptor is good, 3 ligths 1 blue, indicates connectivy port, green for activity and red. I tried with 3 different cables, I broke one cable thinking that could be that the RJ45 was too large to fit in the female connector, but is not. This female connector could it have a building issue, but I really don't know.<br /><br />Is my 2nd time that I bought a product to ANKER (first was the Anker® Astro 3E 10000mAh Portable) Excellent device.<br />But in this case it did not work for me.<br /><br />---<br />Update : 09/11/2013<br /><br />It's seems the device was defective.<br />I've being contacted by the CSR of Anker, they offered me to ship me back a new device or do a total refund.<br />That's why I choose/like Amazon / Anker. They do all their efforts to provide a good customer service<br /><br />Thanks
B008133MDK|5.0|Clever and engaging....I'm hooked and can't wait for more!  The season finale is so good that I think of it daily.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Can I say about this game but its cute and fun trying to get you despicable points by hitting up your Minions. the course are the same format but with different themes.... I am still discovering things in the game you get to buy different clothes for your minion oh the fun never stops
B009NPK1IO|5.0|It's just a fun show to watch!  A little fantasy for the middle class to see how the rich live!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book was the best of all three of them! So sweet and romantic! Love Christian Grey! Can't wait to see the movie!
6305128952|5.0|THE MOVIE WAS GREAT AND TE SCENERY WAS SPECTACULAR.  ONLY THING IS THAT IT WAS MEANT<br />FOR WIDE SCREEN AND WE DO NOT HAVE ONE SO DIDNOT GET FULL VIEW.  BUT IT WAS A WONDERFUL OVIE
B0087GF8ZG|4.0|It is compact and does not take up much space.  It produces good amount of light and very useful.  The motion sensor is sensitive enough.
B009K0P10K|5.0|The first episode of season one was a bit cheesy, but it got better and better and I got hooked!  A definite must see!
B003JBI2KM|5.0|I've been brewing for close to twenty years.  I started after I returned from Germany in 1995 as a result of American beer not holding the same quality as is found in German Beer.  I bought Charlie Papazian's book at that time and have read it so often the cover has fallen off.  It truly is the Home Brewer's bible.  He goes into as much or as little detail based on what the reader wants from the book.  I have since given the original copy a proper burial and purchased this digital version with the hopes it won't deteriorate as the last did.  I recommend this book to anyone looking to join the craft home brewing hobby.
B00001W9G0|4.0|REALLY ENJOYED THE MOVIE AND STREISAND WAS GREAT !  REDFORD WAS HANDSOME AND<br />PLOT WAS VERY WELL DONE .  GOOD OVERVIEW OF THAT ERA
1452110581|4.0|this is just funny. my friend is a cat lover and said she really liked it and it makes a good coffee table book.
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|Very good. Love the music and aura. The story is sad. Never had to read it in school. Oh well
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book. Lives up to its reputation. There are more books that follow and I can't wait to get my hands in those as well.
B00BYM5I1O|4.0|Great tribute to his wife. Keep it going Guy - Just pull up those pants each morning and write some more great ones like this
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|The words were already a part of me. In some way I knew this truth and needed to hear and feel them. Don help this sleeping truth come alive in my heart.
B008PZZYB2|2.0|loved the actors, but it was too silly, wouldn't recommend to anyone. Very boring and silly, glad I didn't have to rent it.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Enjoying this so far.  Easy and quick.  Great for playing while on the plane or waiting for an appointment.  Keeps you occupied for sure
B004DLPXAO|5.0|The Kindle for Android is wonderful!  This application saved the day.  I needed a textbook right away for a college course so i turned to Amazon for help.  The technician was patient and knowledgeable about my device.  Michael you displayed so much professionalism and patience you helped me breath a little easier.  I hope and pray to see this review because I want you to know how much you made a difference to me!
B00BXLU1EU|2.0|Wouldn't even work on a public WiFi site. Located at several places,but still can't access WiFi. I don't recommend this one.
B0085FF55W|3.0|I love this album. The songs are amazing but the recording level is too high. Most of the songs, except the quiet ones are full of distortion. The song st-croix is very affected by distortion. I hope they will release a remastered version with better sound quality.
B00004W48X|5.0|I have watched the video several times since receiving it, it has met my expectations. I have had no problem with any of my purchases through Amazon.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Watched it twice In the first night... Now I want to buy it!! Great movie for family and children. Highly recommend!

1250029465|4.0|James Bowen, a recovering addict and street person, discovers that the love and care of a pet can be therapeutic as well as enjoyable. Bob, an orange tabby, adopts Bowen and by his steadfast nature, helps Bowen curb his addictions.<br /><br />The book is similar to other books by former addicts and as such is suspect as to its ultimate truthfulness based on the memories of one who's memories could well be hampered. None the less, it is pretty well written and is of interest to cat lovers.
B003LR5BD0|5.0|Great movie! I've been searching for a while for it. Excellent role for Robin Williams. Deniro was great and Hillary was hot!
0451529065|5.0|My wife is using this for an evolutionary genetics course. She said that it is exactly what their professor required them to read. I'll be using this book as well when she's done with it. :)
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This is a top quality product and a must have it also make a great gift for personal or business use.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|First, I'm not a religious scholar, but I do attempt to stay current on religious history as events occur such as the discovery of the Gospel of Judas a few yrs ago.  One thing leads to another and my knowledge grows.  I am a retired intelligence officer with experience in wars of liberation and more recently in radical Islam.  I have since my early college classes in comparative religion wondered how the teaching of an itinerant preacher on the street corner led in about 200 yrs to an institutionalized religion.  In the almost 50 yrs since college, Azlan's book has pretty much answered my questions.  Second, I am also fascinated how the Roman Empire handled the nationalistic uprisings throughout the empire.  When diplomacy failed, it resorted to brute force such as genocide or  public execution; many successive empires/governments have done the same thing.  Third, how internal institution politics in the early church (James vs Paul) influenced the religion that we know today.  Althoughj not in this book, the bishop in Lyon in ca 189 CE who discarded all the gospels at that time except Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John; we might have been Copts today if not for his policy.  Thus to realize that  very singular actions have resulted in what we take for granted today.  This I think is what I will remember from Aslan's book.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Borg, Fredriksen, Mack, and many other do a great job writing about the historical and Christ Jesus.  Aslan goes further and writes about what happened after.  His analysis of the Pillars and Paul were very interesting.  His mention of so many other messiahs was also interesting.
B00DQVSTCG|1.0|Let me start by saying I love this concert!!!!  I was actually there for the filming and I see myself on the filming.  However, the blu-ray is defective.  Like others have said, the surround right speaker is mute.  The encoding is bad!!!!!  Too bad because the concert is amazing!!!!! In regards to the video quality, the washed out effects (ala instagram) seem to be on purpose.
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|This movie surprised me because it was a mystery/Sci-Fi mix. I found myself looking around at my family to make sure they were as impressed as I was. They were.<br /><br />Be sure to try to spot the props from Tom's other movies. The aviator glasses from Top Gun, the flannel shirt and ball cap from War of the Worlds, and a very familiar looking toy named \\"Bob\\".
B000W11JGG|5.0|I love this album.  I bought the vinyl when it first came out and forgot about it.  Relearning these fantastic songs is so much fun all over again!!
B0073COMUW|5.0|Had this on continuously for at least 1,000 hours now. Never hot, it's sipping power, and providing some seriously bright white light. Packed very well, no warm up time, looks great. Going to replace several CFLs with these.
0143121421|5.0|I will echo the praise for this book given on this site and elsewhere and mention that it is a sequel to Le Carre's first novel, \\"Call for the Dead\\".  It's not mandatory that you read \\"Call for the Dead\\" first, of course, but it is entertaining to read them back-to-back.  (Le Carre's second novel, \\"A Murder of Quality\\", has nothing to do with the plot of either novel.)
B00843TZJ2|4.0|Old, but unique.  No one since CSN has been able to produce a similar harmonic style.  Vocals not as good as decades ago but still highly enjoyable.  This may well be their last concert tour so DVD is highly collectable.
B000LXHK2C|5.0|This is a delightful movie, one which I can watch again and again. All of the characters are fully fleshed out and believable, the countryside is gorgeous, and the story fun, funny and charming.
B00DSTBMMU|4.0|\\"Feels Like Home\\" is Sheryl Crow \\"going country\\". Going country for a pop/rock artist can mean one of two things.  Either the artist's career is sagging and wants to tap into a new audience, or the country direction is simply enough facet of the artist in question.  Unlike Bon Jovi (who is about as country as Motley Crue), with Sheryl Crow, she clearly demonstrates the later.  Sheryl enlisted some big Nashville guns for this project as collaborators: Chris DuBois, Luke Laird, Shane McAnally, Brad Paisley.  Her music as always is well-polished.<br /><br />If you believe her title (and I believe you should), she feels quite at home in her country trappings, as well she should.  Of all the major female artists of the 1990s, Sheryl Crow is the closest to country-rock.  Her debut, Tuesday Night Music Club, could just as easily have been labelled as country-rock.  (Listen to \\"Nobody Said It Would Be Easy\\" and don't tell me that that song could easily have been recorded for a country project.)  Liz Phair, with \\"Exile in Guyville\\", would be the closest contender to a country-rock artist of the 1990s, although her subsequent albums give the feeling that \\"Exile\\" was more of an anomaly in her catalogue than anything else.<br /><br />While \\"Feels Like Home\\" may have some great, killer hooks, there is a lot of substance behind that flashy production. Crow manages to tap into the emotionally charged, honesty-driven story-telling that vast amounts of people can relate to on a very real level which always distinguishes the best of country music, all the while retaining her pop sensibilities that made her such a star in the first place.<br /><br />That's not to say \\"Feels Like Home\\" is perfect.  The only time the album really gets off kilter is when Crow comes off as trying too hard to be country.  Thankfully, this is few an far between.  Her twang sounds affected on \\"Crazy Ain't Original\\" and \\"We Oughtta Be Drinkin\\".  Also, the later song, along with the lead single \\"Easy\\", appearto be little more than heavy-handed bids for radioplay.  A couple of the tracks also get rather heavy handed in terms of social commentary.<br /><br />\\"Homecoming Queen\\" perfectly encapsultates modern country music all the while retaining Crow's musical identity and sense of style.  The great confessional \\"Homesick\\" would have been at home on any of her early records, and sounds akin to \\"The Difficult Kind\\".  \\"Nobody's Business\\" and \\"Best of Times\\" could easily have been placed on any of her records and no one would be any the wiser.<br /><br />Another track, \\"Waterproof Mascara\\", goes further back into country's roots that most contemporary country does, and would have been at home on an early Loretta Lynn or Dolly Parton record.  Lines like \\"\\"Thank God they make waterproof mascara/'Cause it won't run like his Daddy did,\\" is much more akin to classic country from the 1960s-1980s then anything Nashville is producing now.  Unlike \\"Crazy\\", \\"Easy,\\" and \\"We Oughtta Be Drinkin'\\", Crow makes \\"Waterproof Mascara\\" her own, even though it's the biggest example of Crow turning in her pop-star cred for a cowboy hat and boots.  She really gets into the emotional center of that song.  \\"Waterproof Mascara\\" could easily have been just another caricature of a typical country song; as it stands, that song is one of the album's highlights.<br /><br />Other times, though, she taps into some relatable, blue-collar cliches that come off as rather condescending.  Unlike Bruce Springsteen, who could really nail the trials and tribulations of the working class and sound deeply authentic, when you hear Crow sing about being a poor, white trash country girl, you have a hard time believing that.  These moments represent the album's biggest stumbling blocks.  Sheryl Crow has always had an air of the cosmopolitan about her, which in the country market is closest akin to The Dixie Chicks.  They ditched their original lead singer, drafted Natalie, renamed themselves The Dixie Chicks from the Dixie Chickens, and the rest is history.  Their type of audience is much more likely to be coffee-house types than the deeply redneck, shot-gun toting stereotypical white trash.  Likewise, Sheryl's music feels more at home on a high class café with a hundred different wines and cheeses than a country bar with the Confederate Flag on prominent display.<br /><br />Despite the sometimes effected twang and occasional self-conscious \\"Look at Me, I'm doig Country!\\" song , \\"Feels Like Home\\" could just as have easily been a followup to \\"The Globe Sessions\\" or \\"C'Mon, C'Mon\\".<br /><br />Crow has always had a lot of similarities with the country genre, even with her pop sensibilities.  Unlike \\"100 Miles to Memphis\\" and its emphasis on soul, \\"Feels Like Home\\" never feels simply like a genre experiment.  Too her immense credit, \\"Feels Like Home\\" sounds like a natural extension of who Sheryl is as an artist and only seldomly feels forced.
B007EECSFA|4.0|The book switches between the 1940s and 2011 and it's one of those where the 1940s story is so intriguing that you wish it would stop going to the present.  There are some twists in the story and I tried to guess what would happen but was surprised with what really played out.
B00B4VI8MQ|1.0|...after I paid for the full version nothing happened. It just keeps sending me back to the purchase menu. First problem I've had with G5 games.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I LOVED THIS BOOK.  IT CAPTURED ME FROM PAGE 1.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THE BOOK TO ANYONE WHO HAS SEEN THE MOVIE.  IT GIVES YOU MUCH, MUCH MORE INFORMATION.
B00BEIYMTW|2.0|\\"Planes\\" finds Disney, and John Lasster in particular, revisiting the world of \\"Cars\\".  Lassiter, one of the masterminds of Pixar, came up with the original concept of \\"Cars\\" as well as \\"Cars 2\\".  Essentially, all the cars are anthropomorphic and are characters in their own right.<br /><br />In terms of critical reception, the \\"Cars\\" franchise has been the most problematic of the Pixar IPs.  While both critics and audiences alike really enjoyed the original \\"Cars\\", that picture marked the first time that a Pixar picture garnered less than glowing reviews.  To know where I stand as a reviewer, personally \\"Cars\\" is one of my personal favorite Pixar films, even though I never really liked Nascar.<br /><br />\\"Cars 2\\", meanwhile, has been the worst received Pixar flick yet.  Mixing international intrigue (essentially James Bond in a cartoon setting with a redneck tow truck called Mater being the central focus of that particular plotline) with the original racing of the first \\"Cars\\", most critics and audiences alike felt \\"Cars 2\\" simply fell flat.<br /><br />Then we come to \\"Planes\\", the worst movie yet set in the franchise.  Plagued by a dull, by-rote script, a very predictably storyline, and low quality control, \\"Planes\\" is a very low flying picture, to put it lightly.  To be fair, DisneyToons produced \\"Planes\\", which is Disney's direct to DVD division.  Only after seeing some completed sequences did Disney chose to do a theatrical release.  However, you can easily tell this is a direct to DVD film, with all the lower quality control that Direct to DVD implies.<br /><br />Watching the movie you simply feel that they piecemealed it from the first two pictures, with the best elements stripped away.  \\"Planes\\" marries the race drama of the first \\"Cars\\" with the international [mixture] adventure of the second \\"Cars\\" with characters who are little more than painted caricatures of screen-writing archetypes.<br /><br />First: the animation.  There are some great sequences (especially those involving the scenic sections of the movie, such as the Taj Mahal and the mountains).  The battle sequence where we learn more of Skipper's character is simply stunning, and on the same level as the Pixar movies.  There is a great uneveness though, where some of the sequences (especially those with lots of cars) are bland and almost appear as unfinished.<br /><br />You also feel you've already seen these characters before.  For those who found Mater intolerable, the racers from different countries are little more than stereotypical caricatures painted with very broad strokes of cultural insensitivity.  We have a lover-boy Mexican who also is a musican, an uptight British plane, an erotically charged (toned down for a kid movie, obviously) French Canadian who speaks the \\"language of love\\", and a cheating villian that never rises above mere thug.<br /><br />Without giving away spoilers, Dusty Crophopper (a crop dusting plane) dreams of being a low-flying racer, and wants to enter a competiton called \\"Wings Across the World\\".  He enters the qualifying rounds and does not make it, but later is admitted due to one of the qualifiers cheating. Having been trained by Chug (a fuel truck voiced by Brad Garret, AKA Robert Barone from \\"Everybody Loves Raymon\\"), both Dusty and Chug list the at-first hesitant Skipper, a World War II plane who fought various battles with the famed , whose motto is truth first.  However, mysteriously Skipper does not fly himself and hasn't for years.<br /><br />Once Dusty gets in the race, the movie simply turns into different segments of the race (of which there are seven), with different plot points being checked off.  During the movie, he assists various other planes in the race, and is met also with betrayal.  Due to his assistance with the various other racers, at one point they return the favors, setting Dusty up for the climactic finale.  He learns the reason for Skipper's grounding, and battles for first place with Ripslinger,his main archnemesis in the picture.<br /><br />While \\"Cars\\" was a homage to Nascar, the racing was only a small element in that movie.  \\"Cars\\" largely tapped into (brilliantly, I might add) that Route 66 culture of the 1950s-1970s, before the Interstates came in and travellers lost a lot of the scenic majesty of traveling through the United States and exploring the country that can only be done off the Interstate.  While the racing drama tied into \\"Cars\\" excellently, you cared more about McQueen and what he learned in his stay in Radatior Springs, as well as all the characters he encounters.  You care more about the outcome of the race because the race wasn't the only driving focus.  Lightening McQueen was egotistical; the citizens of Radiator Springs helped Lightening not only become a better \\"car\\", but also to appreciate a slower life-style.  The movie is much more about McQueen's growing relationships and growth as a character than it ever was about the race.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this focus on character growth never seems to take flight in \\"Planes\\", unlike \\"Cars\\", which ultimately means the film simply denegrates into spectacle in the racing sequences, following shallow, predictable plotpoints that never really elevate the film into the upper echelon of quality animation, as is the wont of the best of the Pixar/Disney films.<br /><br />While \\"Cars\\" used the race as a back drop for deeper story telling, \\"Planes\\" simply becomes a retreat of all those underdog stories.  Due to the longer running time of \\"Cars\\", we get to know the characters more.  In \\"Planes\\", the characters never rise above either ethnic stereotypes or dull characters we've all seen in so many other movies.  Ultimately, you by the end of the film you will probably care more for Skipper than anyone else, but by then it's too most likely too late.  Even Dusty Crophopper changes very little (with one minor exception dealing with his \\"low flying\\" tendencies\\".  Compare Dusty's story arc to McQueen's story arc and Dusty comes away looking much the worst for wear.  We've seen Dusty's story arc so often in so many other movies that he is simply not compelling, and there is so little character evolution within Dusty that the film just falls flat, especially when compared to McQueen.<br /><br />Ultimatley, \\"Planes\\" becomes little more than a further ploy for Disney to create merchandise using the \\"Cars\\" brand.  Its Direct to DVD origins are \\"planely\\"evident for everyone above five year olds to see, and had it stayed direct to dvd this film would not nearly have been as offensive as it is to fans of Pixar and Disney.  Unlike the best of Pixar/Disney, which appeal to young and old alike, only the youngest will find this film truly enjoy.  The rest will find it dull, predictable, and simply far below the mark previously set by \\"Cars\\" and even \\"Cars 2\\".
B004J4WN0I|4.0|The magic is here. An enjoyable story with fun characters and enough political infighting to keep me guessing, I found myself laughing out loud at Oberon's antics. The fight scenes are tense enough and the main character is pretty fun.<br /><br />If you liked The Name of the Wind (Rothfuss), Dragon Bones (Briggs) or Callahan's Crosstime Saloon stories (Robinson) you will probably enjoy this book immensely.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was my favorite read this summer!  I never saw the ending coming.  As a parent I really could relate to the many emotions felt by the parents.
B00C1LIYWM|5.0|I CHOSE THIS RATING BECAUSE I LOVE NICHOLAS SPARKS BOOKS AND MOVIES.  HE HAS NEVER FAILED TO KEEP ME ENTERTAINED FROM START TO FINISH.  I WOULD RECOMMEND EITHER THE BOOK OR THE MOVIE TO ANYONE.
B005LAIH2M|5.0|An enjoyable twist to the children's fairy tale. Lots of action and plenty of blood for those that enjoy special effects with plenty of bodily fluids.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I liked it. go ahead and watch it it's free. if you like sci fi you will enjoy it. this was written by my husband.
B006LSZECO|5.0|At each chapter I went back and forth liking and disliking the main character.  I have to say I was disappointed with the ending, but am anxious to see how the movie plays out.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Wish it didn't take so long to load each time. Got 75% of the land and still hasn't unlocked certain upgrades.
B003L77G10|5.0|I picked up all of the first four seasons on DVD.  Arguably the best show on TV right now... have you watched television recently?
B002APU580|5.0|I would have loved to live back in those times.  Women acted like women & were modest & respectful.  They treated men the way men should be treated & waited for a husband, instead of running around with different men. Families were involved in the choosing of a spouse.  What has our culture turned into now? Also, Mr. Darcy was a VERY attractive man.  Such a manly man with his attire & whole demeanor..& the way he reserved his emotions towards Elizabeth until the end.  I love a good love story & would definitely recommend it!
B004QCJA7W|4.0|The edition is fine, the the binding is of good quality and the font size quite readable.  There is a very large black<br />felt-tip pen mark on the top end of the book on the page edges.  I will not keep this book.
B0067Q04AM|5.0|Great cut my 3rd copy. Love the composition and instrumentation<br />I own copies of all of Mr Glasper's albums all of them are stellar<br /><br />Where did this Guy cut his chops
B008EKON56|5.0|I needed a high quality audio interface to my iPhone for my Headroom Total Bithead headphone amp (sadly now discontinued). Works great with a short mini cable.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have many of Jillian's DVD's.  There isn't any DVD I dislike, but this is my favorite so far.  I really like her approach to fitness.  I especially like the  3-2-1 formula so you never get sick and tired of any 1 exercise.  This DVD definitely works.  Building muscle makes you more fit and helps dropping the lbs.  When I am doing this DVD regularly, I work up to doing 2 full workouts per day.  When I get busy and stop doing this, the pain in my knees and back comes back as my muscle strength  go away.  Highly recommend this DVD.  If you are a true beginner, do her Beginner DVD first and build up to this.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|At the very beginning it was very fun. But then there was the whole reset thing. Then cannot load base thing. Then they updated it it was fine for a while everything worked. Now after newest update can't access almost any ally or enemy bases. The texture are all black and white. When the game relays on allies this much it would be nice to visit there base to collect hearts but after newest update I can only visit 3 or 4 out 25 allies and same for enemies why waste time and resources if you can't even invade enemy bases. Was a five star game that turned in a two star shame.
B005LF9IO8|4.0|Although it is not new, and I was the only person in room seeing it for first time, everyone else really liked this movie.  I was definitely surprised that I enjoyed it as I am not usually much of an action movie fan, but I can safely say it is worth watching.
0307010856|1.0|I was so excited to receive this book for my son. I ordered it; even though the shipping cost was the same amount as the book! When I finally received this in the mail; I opened up the package and was hit with an awful odor! The book reeked like rotten fish and the pages were stained with a brown liquid. I checked the box to see if it occurred during shipping, but the box was in excellent condition.
B00COGZ8FU|2.0|If you have read any of the Jack Reacher novels you cannot use Tom Cruise for Reacher's role….it just doesn't fit. The movie was a a let down after having read the book already.

0385528752|5.0|Again, indebted to reviews.  I made the decision to purchase after reading reviews by others.  Excellent book - really helped me a lot in structuring my thoughts on how to approach the process of change.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!  Was one of the best books I've ever read.  This is a must read - start it today.
0786860707|5.0|Loved it.<br />If you want to be an animator, you must have it.<br />(Also useful for character design in other areas).
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read.  I'm so glad that my friend recommended that I read this book.  Very well written and so very interesting.
B005O30Y5Y|5.0|We love the Harry Potter movies, and this is no exception.  Doesn't follow the book perfectly, but no movie ever does.  Still well-done and very entertaining.
1442359919|4.0|Joyland once again validates SK as one of America's best storytellers.  The rich character development, the introduction to the &#34;carnie&#34; subculture, and the fascinating plot, not to mention the underlying mystery, combined to make for a terrific read.<br />I heartily recommend this novel.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was quite amazing it really makes you stop and look at the idea of love conquering all that gets in its way even if she is unsure about loving him
B009UX2YAC|1.0|After a amount of time it gets boring. It is not worth it even if it is free. I hated it.
0439813786|5.0|My 10-year-old son loved this book.  A great story and beautiful illustrations.  It's a great gift idea for an older child.
B00AX6KNOY|1.0|Terrible! Poor dialogue. The movie was poorly written and the dialogue pathetic.  There is no character development. Waste of time I couldn't finish watching it.

B003ODIZL6|5.0|I live books about mythical creatures it really helped me any MY vocabulary I love Michael Phelps wait who is he
0345803485|3.0|Since I finished the book and enjoyed parts of it, I give this 3 stars. The 'Oh My's' and the Inner Goddess stuff got on my last nerve and made me want to pull my hair out. The character of Ana, well I hated her. Christian though, he intrigued me. In the end, I just felt meh about the book, but I'm going to finish the series and hope for the best.
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|Suits is probably the best show on TV right now.  Find it, watch it, you will love it! I guarantee it!
B006885EFE|5.0|I love this series and will buy the whole thing.<br />Streaming skipped a little as we were watching.  I might just buy the disks instead of the stream.
B00AZMFJYA|2.0|The DVD version has the movie on it, which was fantastic, and scene selection.<br /><br />No, absolutely NONE, bonus features or commentary options. I'm not even sure if there's a subtitle option on the disk. I was really looking forward to the extra content, which is apparently only available on the Blu-Ray discs. Don't buy this if you're looking for the extras, because it's a waste of money. Now I have to go out and buy the Blu-ray/digital copy.
B002F6FQGK|5.0|Harmonious and ethereal, Florence and the Machine infuse each song with<br />divine energy and in some a hard rock edge.  Favorites are Rabbit Heart,<br />Howl, Kiss With a Fist, Between Two Lungs, Cosmic Love, My Boy Builds<br />Coffins, Dog Days Are Over and Blinding.  If you love this band or want<br />to try something different, try this album!
B004Z2TUGE|1.0|Picture too dark, never really got to watch it completely to hard to watch will be stopping this membership very soon
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|I ordered it, but it does not fit my Kindle.  I still have it because it didn't seem worth the expense to send it back!  I'll just be very careful in the future what I order.
B009WUAK2M|3.0|Kind of cheesey but very fun watch, Great for the guys that like action fliks. I will give it three stars out of five.
B00138D3VQ|5.0|When I was a teen and saw Wayne's World and heard Bohemian Rhapsody!<br />Have loved the men of Queen ever since (though it was not the first<br />that I heard of Queen).  Also I heard about the first two albums<br />that they made and I found them both in MP3 format (will write about the album<br />Queen II later) to my delight.  Brian May's guitar wails, Roger<br />Taylor's drums bash, John Deacon's bass guitar sings combined<br />with Freddie Mercury's vocals.  I wonder what the first listeners<br />thought about Queen as they listened to the album!<br /><br />Personal favorites are Keep Yourself Alive, the two versions of Liar,<br />Doing All Right, My Fairy King, Modern Times, and Seven Seas of Rhye,<br />but the other songs are great too!  Must listen for all fan of rock<br />and Queen!
0756686970|5.0|Great book for any Star Wars fan. My kids love it and the bonus action figure is a plus. Buy today.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|I don't know why everybody is such a critic. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen and my favorite Iron man movie yet. Excellent acting, spectacular special effects, and a good plot combine to make a must-see movie
B00684J49U|4.0|Oh where will Meredith and Derek end up in this season, was the first thing I thought when I first started watching this. We all know where the 7th season ended off with them and watching them regroup I thought was very nice and quick which made room for other stories. With Callie and Arizona both working on their careers, the death of Henry and Teddy's grief and anger towards Owen over it, the ever growing tension between Cristina and Owen over the abortion, and then with the scandalous affair in the last half, this season just really puts the bar high which by the way season 9 lived nowhere near up to. With Bailey's engagement in the season finale, Richard's surprise and sadness over his wife's progressing disease, the hilarious softball game, and the horrific plane crash in the season finale this is a season worth getting on DVD and watching again and again.
B002ZBZNPO|5.0|Haunting eerie powerful vocals and thundering instruments make this<br />album!  Personal favorites are Sweet Sacrifice, Call Me When You're<br />Sober (which is the song that made me want this album!), Weight of the<br />World, Snow White Queen, Your Star, All that I'm living for, and Lose<br />Control.  If you love rock and this band, you must listen and buy this<br />album.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|We only had The Lion King in VHS so we were thrilled when the Blu Ray version came out.  The colors are amazing.
B008Y7N7JW|1.0|I watched this movie with a friend and my 18 year old nephew.  Ur, I should say we TRIED to watch it.  About 45 minutes in, my nephew asks, &#34;When are they going to fight?&#34;  My thoughts exactly.  All this build up and dialogue and the whole time we're thinking JUST GET TO IT ALREADY!<br />Total bore. We finally turned it off.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I love this game sooo mutch as a fellow peguasister i love this but it is the bits and gems and so.e missions you need a bunch of gems or bits cant they just put like a few chest with gems or bits
B00CSYRHG6|5.0|This movie boldly approaches a delicate subject matter that will leave you're jaw on the floor. I don't want to spoil anything, but I was not expecting what this delivered at all. Definitely a another winner from Studio Ghibli.
B0013ND30W|5.0|Our 4-year old granddaughter loves Sleeping Beauty.  It was hard to find so when I finally did get a copy, she was elated!  As with most 4-year olds, she would prefer to watch Sleeping Beauty over and over and over again.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|wow!  I stumbled on to this series by accident.  Jackpot!  Fantastically written.  The characters are compelling, the descriptions of this world are complete.  I feel like if I were dropped into one of the silos i might just be able to find my way around.  Reading this series was like experiencing a different life.  Now I've got to have more!
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Im really not into games anymore but ever since i started playing iron man makes me wonna get back into them..good job guys!
B00B2JSRAS|3.0|Actually nothing new has been said but you get a lot of good tips, all in one book. Moreover it is brief and to the point.
B00CCXL9OE|5.0|Anything Disney in our house is a big hit and Aladdin is no exception.  It's even better in Blu Ray!
B00DDZM0GQ|3.0|The game is a good time waster but for some reason this game really makes my Nexus 7 run hot and runs the battery down fast.  Really fast.  That's surprising considering that the graphics or gameplay don't seem that over the top.
B00190OHD6|5.0|This movie is sad but so good. It's a very powerful movie, about loss and coming back from it. Love me some Gerard Butler!!
B001BC5HXG|5.0|My friends and I read this as part of our book club. It was my first Steinbeck novel, but surely not my last. The author developed so many characters so thoroughly and constructed such a complex story without confusing the reader. It was long, but the pacing and structure are perfect.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|If you're into romance with a little edgyness then this is the book for you, only read half way thru it so far.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I have to say that I began loving this because it actually showcased the legal industry and not just everyone hopping in and out of bed with each other.  Well of course, that is also included in this show.  I think you will be torn just as is the heroine.  I think I may be hooked.
B0087GF8ZG|1.0|This product just doesn't work.  The motion detector did not activate the light ... ever.  Even in total darkness.  I was able to turn it on manually using the switch, so I know it wasn't a battery problem.  I returned this to Amazon for a refund.<br /><br />Amazon makes you put at least one star on reviews.  If I could rate this zero stars, I would.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Great game good for kids long game never beat on good for all ages u can always upgrade your car or what u driv
B007URVZJ6|4.0|When I first opened the book about a month ago, I was expecting something quite different from what I got. I thought it would be a technical manual for preparing one's book to be converted to Kindle. But am I glad I was wrong.<br /><br />Instead, I found an author who took the fruit of the Spirit and applied the different fruits to blogging. She took each fruit and showed how it applied to your attitude when writing, to the writing itself, and to the reader. But instead of this being a one-time read I plan on using it as a regular guide.<br /><br />While I do blog, I am also a writer, editor of a newsletter, and a talk show host. I plan on using this guide as a continuing resource. A book that will enable me to not only write better blogs, but which can also impact my other endeavors.<br /><br />Interestingly I already subscribe to faithfulbloggers. But I have signed up for so many different bloggers that I wasn't that familiar with her name or work. I thing that is about to change.<br /><br />Why did I give it 4 stars. Two reasons. First, I try not to give 5 stars; the book would have to be outstanding to receive 5 stars. The second reason is that it is well written, with real applications that I can use. Nor did I find any misspelled words or poor content. All in all, I was quite pleased!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Loved this book!<br />I learned so much about the dichotomy of the many nations involved in the war ! I had no idea how the Germans who were not on board with the nazi's , suffered for years,starving, spying, putting their lives in peril, knowing they could be tortured and then killed at any moment , living in a world Americans although came in and pretty much solved the problem and ended it all ! We , still did not feel the effects of the two world wars as much as Europe did !!<br />They should teach this in school ! It would make kids listen and learn !
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|Jesus of Nazareth, his followers, his brother James, and the impact of his presence on earth,  given from this detailed historical perspective is insightful and profound.  Well written, and thought provoking,
B00CL68BK2|2.0|My fault for expecting a movie about Sports.  It has only a minor role.  It's 2 hours I won't get back.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|I love the music. I cannot wait to take this CD on my road trip! Her vocals are outstanding. Will suggest this CD to anyone who likes music sung by a strong female lead.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I use this to get on with other tasks when I know that I will become lost in my books. Try it.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I love how the word is pronounced in a voice that you can understand... (there is a novelty, right?) This is the best dictionary ever!
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|I guess I expected more due to the hype.  It was OK for a Saturday night.  Just not fantastical as I expected.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I was so upset after the ending of the first book that I couldn't wait to read the second, and I loved it!! I'm now looking forward to reading the 3rd and last book =).
B003Y6EL5W|5.0|This is still one of my favorite comic book movies.  It's just plain fun.  Hit Girl and Big Daddy definitely steal the show.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I have read a few books in fitness and this is one of the best. Really like his writing style and the information is top notch.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|Awesome movie and not your typical sequel.  This one stands on its own as an amazing show off special effects, cast and great story. 3 thumbs up.
B002SHD9E2|5.0|I love that you can stream movies for free through Amazon Prime. Another added perk that I just became aware of.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|A fun, silly, playful and well done spoof on reality worth a little of your teeny brain time to enjoy with someone of like mind.
1878424319|5.0|This will set you free from the bondage of self. I have the kindle edition, paperback, and audible. This how much I like this little book of wisdom. I'm a complicated guy trying to learn how to live a simple life of being Happy, Joyous, and. Free Man!<br /><br />He explains in a very clear matter a fact way how the agreements affect every area of our lives. If you are seeking peace of mind this will make a lot of sense to you. You have nothing to loose for $6.65 and a lifetime of freedom to gain.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|this was a great show. I was really sorry to see it get canceled. It even had a great ending also.
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|Great Product. I really enjoy having a case that I can now place my Bluetooth in for protection.  Must admit it took me minute to figure out exactly how to place in case.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I just think this is a really well done sci fi show. Nothing fancy, but the effects far exceeded my expectations and its just a great summer escapist show.
048623231X|5.0|Dore and his many artists illustrated many books via engraved prints, and this is one of the best.  Nostly &#34;Inferno&#34; images, Purgatorio and Paradiso are interesting, but bland.
B00C7JGDBW|3.0|This was OK. Its pretty hard to compete with a classic like this. At least instead of doing a &#34;remake&#34; they came at it from a different angle.
B000TDFKVW|5.0|I have heard a few Enigma songs before but listening to Gravity of Love on the radio the other day got me to thinking I should try an album since I really like that song. I figured that LSD would be a good one to try since it had plenty of their greatest hit. The first time I heard the whole album it was ok. The second time was much better. Now I can not stop listening to this masterpiece. How the heck did I not ever buy anything by them before? All I can say is I am REALLY glad I got this album. Give it a chance and don't immediately say &#34;no&#34; because it doesn't sound like your typical group. The songs will stick in your head and you will be hooked.
193700788X|5.0|I Love this Book. It wrapped everything up though not how I would have but whatev it still worked. The only thing I didnt like is that it was the last one. I have to admit I cried.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I'm a very frequent twitter User so I'm always on this app. everything runs perfectly and just as it should. I get all my updates and my 1,000+ followers are never alone
B008X9Z37A|3.0|I like my case, but I'd prefer a clam shell- type one.  They're just too expensive.  I also like that I can clip a stylus on the edge of this case, so I never have to hunt around for one.
B004ADF7RO|4.0|This is a great movie. It was everything a children's adventure movie should be and does not take itself too seriously.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|I chose this rating as it was a lovely story of found love and commitment.  A young man who is trying to break a drug habit finds a stray cat who he falls in love with.  Neither the cat or the young man have any other love or support in their lives and joining forces they change both their lives.<br />This story is short but well written and held my interest.  I recommend it to someone who needs a lift and wants a fast read.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Now that I've read call the Reacher books I suppose I'll have to find something else to do for a while, at least until the next book comes out tomorrow.
B00A83075M|5.0|This was a gift and I know the kids I sent it to loved the movie, they said it came on time and no issues, they watch it all the time
B002VE8YLK|5.0|this album was awesome awesome awesome nice to listen too by yourself or with that special someone glass of wine or two cuddle
1592537251|4.0|This book show sketching from all over the world.  Sketchers traveling and doing journals featuring their sketches.  The book gives you the idea of what is possible in a rough sketch.  i liked it as I am doing some travel sketches too.
B00C28J2VQ|5.0|So far the best 3D movie so far .My lg  55&#34; kept me dogging blood knives and explosions. Had a lot of Fun
B00CATSONE|5.0|I love this book! It  really made me think about what my contribution to the world would be, and what we all need to do in order  to accomplish everything we have always wanted in life.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|I played for a few minutes and put it down. I must say it got better as I went. I like how you can continue playing without spending a lot of money. After playing for a couple days I was happy to spend some money on a gem package. I'm sure I'll buy another one before it's all over. Thanks for a fun game
B00DBISUWS|4.0|I honestly thought this was something made up when I heard the name mentioned in the movie, \\"Hard Candy\\". After all, I am in my late 40s, so I usually just stumble across something new, or have it shoved in my ear by one of my kids. This came up via Spotify and so I gave it a listen.<br /><br />I really found some nice sounds here. The voice reminds me of a cross between Kate Bush and Sarah McLachlan. I am hardly qualified to make comparisons as I fell into this so recently, but I found the music to be exceptional.
B00ESY77LO|5.0|Great movie. One of the best I've seen in a long time. Really enjoyed the artistic twist, and they did a good job of bringing the 30s and current day together.
B004XUMMFE|4.0|The series was good -- I thought the first few episode were kind of slow, but after that, the characters grow on you and we looked forward to the next episode. The series was way too short -- should have been continued.
0762451319|4.0|good product, had everything as described, picture is misleading though, box very small. why do I even have to add more words?
B004GJNFHG|5.0|Excellent movie for those who like true-to-life historical drama. It is very raw, and real, and I enjoyed it a lot.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Amazing. Never thought I could read a book in a week but I did. It was a good book. I thought about the book in my free time at work!
1452101248|5.0|I'm not an accomplished cook, nor do I have a huge collection of cookbooks; but I absolutely love this book.  It's beautiful to look at, and I haven't found a recipe I haven't wanted to try.  This will definitely be on my gift list for friends and family.
B008A36R2Y|5.0|Stunning Features Arduino, you can develop systems where the limit is the imagination for a low price and many accessories, excellent development environment, practical and easy to program. Excellent miniature computer.
B006LXQID8|5.0|This movie is delightful and sweet.  It's amazing all the introspection and little things in life that happen when we are not obsessed with our cell phones and technology, facebook, twitter, etc.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|It is a fun game with great graphics &amp; storyline.  So far, have not needed to spend any money to play. Very addicting game.
B00E0MCYPS|1.0|Extremely poor steering controls and basic gameplay. I would not recommend this title. Hey, at least I got mine for for free.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|The game is great, it's just like the consoles except now it kinda feels like actually playing with cards on my kindle.  My only problem with this version is you can only play multiplayer with Bluetooth, which is not cool because my kindle is only Wi-Fi. I think the should update the game and give the Wi-Fi users multiplayer capabilities
B00CTXBO9M|5.0|we lide to play this game and the kids like it too. we need more like this and no more violent games. thanks
B003B02PEU|5.0|I enjoyed this book. It keeps you interested, as do all of his Novels!  I highly recommend it You won't want to put it down until you finish!
B0090KZDSK|2.0|I felt that when reading Gideon and Eva's story for the third time I was just reading for curiosity. The stories and themes didn't give me much to feel for. It didn't eventuate, evolve, mature. It was more like a slow dance to no where.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The first 2-4 chapters are slow but it all adds up. This book was really good. I enjoyed it very much.
B003G4W49C|4.0|It's another new twist on science fiction.  It shows what can happen when society/government takes such a divergence from normally accepted values.  But, also just a very good book.  I will read the next book in the series.  I have to find out what happens with Ender and Valentine.
B0010HA68I|5.0|I'm using the OP/TECH system with my new Sony RX100 M2 (with the MegaGear jacket case) in conjunction with the OP/TECH Mini QD Loops and the OP/TECH Cam Strap. These are absolutely fantastic for hiking. I've attached them to the loops on the shoulder straps of my Camelbak, and they stay there until I hook my camera into them. Long enough to flip up to take pictures, and my camera is much more accessible while hiking than when in a case that I have to open to take a shot.
1878424114|3.0|Deepak Choppa \\"Seven Spiritual Laws of Success\\" clearly defines the varied laws, how it can shape your life, well-being, and to establish successes in your life. Yet, as I read the law on giving, this is nothing new under the sun since this law is clearly explained in the Bible on the notion of giving. We are not to give grudgingly, but cheerfully, which shows an act of giving. He also expounds on the more we give, the more we will receive; which again the Bible implies on this same premises on \\"abundance\\" and that it is better to give than to receive. (I wonder do people truly apply the act of giving, if so, we wouldn't have so many greedy and selfish people in the world.)<br /><br />Karma is also mentioned; which the world loves to speak on this concept. It is based on our actions, and therefore we will receive in return for the consequences of our actions. Choppa does quote from a quote that everyone says (which surely came from the Bible): What a person sown then they will reap. Overall, we have to make wiser choices since we will get these things in return based on those decisions we've made.<br /><br />Moreover after each law is explained, then commitments (or affirmations) are given. His main point is to be accountable for our decisions, choices, and actions as well as take full responsibility, by not blaming others. We have to face reality. How do we use our energy? He uses the word \\"energy\\" a lot, but this simply is based on our intuition; thought process; and productivity as a whole. How will we spend our time? Unnecessary things or things that will be beneficial?<br /><br />Quantum is expressed as well, mind aside from the body (physical attributes) that is influenced by desires and intentions.<br /><br />Amazingly, how people greatly admire to take heed to his conceptual information via books, speaking events, and TV specials on his insight.<br /><br />Adrienna Turner, author of God is in the Equation and The Day Begins with Christ
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I bought this for a friend who was recuperating from surgery and then I sat down and watched the whole thing.  The writing is superb and I am hooked on the soap opera of Downton Abbey.
B003L20IHE|2.0|I had already read &#34;The Lucky One&#34; and this was one of my favorites. So, Charlie St. Cloud was a little bit of a let down.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|Just took this charger on a camping trip, where I recharged my Galaxy S4 twice, my camera, and my headlamp on one not-even-full charge! I also have the 13000mAh version, but prefer this version as it's lighter and less noticeable in my bag.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|A relatively quick and enjoyable read but not with unique insights.  Not as good as albums other books but enjoyable.
B00338QENI|5.0|I appreciated the depth of the research that went into writing this book, the education I received about cells and cultures and results, and the heartfelt sensitivity of members of the Lacks family.
B00013RC8O|5.0|Just as good as I remembered it. One of my all time favorite movies. Was glad to finally get to see it again.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Never have to use the hdmi cable to my laptop again! Great for casting streaming sports or other shows that won't work on the standard Google TV. Best feature is that the Chrome tab you're casting from doesn't even have to be on top, so I can keep working on my laptop while streaming from it. Perfect for traveling, as I can take Netflix, etc. with me without bringing a laptop and cable.
B00B19H2KU|4.0|Pretty good movie. I would watch it again. Not bloody but good scare. Sure to be a remake. Highly recommend
B00CUKTGJO|5.0|I got the mp3 album today and downloaded it - it's great. The remastered songs are sharp and the music sounds better than ever. I'll have the actual CD on Thursday and will look it over. True, I could have burned all of these songs onto a CD from my own collection but it wouldn't have been the same. This is a nice addition to my Clash library and it's well worth ten bucks. I love this band more than ever- there are few groups that I'm still listening to after almost 30 years- The Clash still rocks.
B005LAII3U|1.0|Horrible. Pointless to remake, especially when both the story line & script for this effort are so bad. Across the board, there was poor acting, every performance was one dimensional. The villain wasn't really a villain, he never really did anything believable or provided an antagonistic interplay with the main characters.  Farrell was basically a deer in headlights from start to finish. Beckensale thought she was the Terminator (very odd). Biel never made for a believable underground lieutenant resistance fighter. Every other supporting character was about a cliché as it gets. I wanted to fast forward just so it would end sooner. Pointless remake.
B007THA4FI|4.0|This story kept my interest, sounds like welfare in America, sadly.  I did not like the &#34;F&#34; word and the way the kids and parents reacted to each other, but I am elderly and my children are grown.  It's a different world out there!<br /><br />J.K. Rowling is such an excellent author.  You have to love her books!
B0000714BP|5.0|i saw this movie a very long long time ago and i absolutely fell inlove with it. So now a added it to my collectiion.<br />i find it very touching and extremly beautifull. de dvd has excellet quality. the package arribed on time and the product is in perfect conditiones. thank you very much. i am very pleased with my purchase. bye bye
B00881VLCE|2.0|Had a hard time trying to decide if I payed for just one puzzle or a group of them. So I have not done anything with this game.
B004UID2LC|4.0|This app was a really aawesome app until it didn't let me download anything anymore. I downloaded most of my favorite youtube videos, so I can watch them on the go instead of being bored in the car in long drives. The videos you download will be in your gallery. It worked great with my kindle fire, but now it doesn't work. I didn't update because I knew something bad would happen to it. Instead it updated itself and now I cant use it anymore. I would still recommend to get it, but enjoy it while it lasts. I had to remove it from my kindle fire. :(
B000J5XS3C|5.0|I like it!  Had been using a Mackie that went bye bye , this fits my need for small gigs
B004UPANAI|4.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie.  It was nice to see the beginning of the beginning of X-Men.  Adventure and suspenseful.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Disappointed in this reading.  It was not what I expected it to be. Kept reading to see if there would be better development within the story.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Im not very computer savvy so I find it kind of difficult but very useful for finding old friends and products
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Use it virtually every day with notes and information during presentations. Recording allows you to take notes and record at the same time which is great.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Lots of fun just wish there was more energy in game without having to spend $$$$ Very addictive<br />hard to stop when you run out of energy
B009RX8MQ0|5.0|I just loved this dvd.  I am hooked.  I am so glad that I pre-ordered this item.  It arrived on the day it was released.  I couldn't stop watching it.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Highly recommend! Can't wait to start part 2 (in the next 5 minutes!). Read until my eyes bleed! Make sure you have time to dedicate because you won't want to put it down...
B0043UB0EI|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows so I was happy to have to purchase the season on here for such a great price.
B000I0XLYO|4.0|It ain't for everyone but this is a comedy masterpiece. Ben stiller and Owen Wilson are hilarious together like always.
B0028R3NCU|5.0|Something very important worth mentioning if you're considering using this to transfer large files, is that you have to find out what speed class your micro sd card is. For example, I have a 32gb class 4 micro sd. Although the card reader works with no problems, for larger files like movies, there is a noticeable loss in transfer speed compared to standard usb flash drives. In conclusion, if you currently have a class 10 micro sd card or you are not planning on using this for large files, than non of these issues apply to you and I would definitely recommend this reader to you.<br /><br />*EDIT*<br />I have decided to raise my review score from 3 stars, to 5 stars. Due to the fact that I have been blown away by the durability of this product. After 6 months of regular use (Copying large files for school, spending it's life hanging from my keychain, MANY drops, and a harsh winter), this device hasn't shown the slightest signs of giving up. I would definitely recommend this product to revive an old micro sd laying around.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved the first two Crossfire novels and after this one came out, I made the mistake of reading reviews first - which are mixed... and not buying this novel. But - S. Day is one of my favorite authors so I gave in and I am SO glad I read the 3rd installment of the Crossfire novels.<br /><br />Yes, I did not care much about Megumi and her love life - really - who cares - so I just skipped those scenes. But otherwise - the read was great! Although I am frustrated to wait for another book (and potentially 2 more?) to see how it'll all move on and \\"end\\", I am glad that Eva and Gideon will still be around for awhile and am looking forward to the next novel. If Day had ended the story with this book, we'd all be depraved - from my POV :).<br /><br />Go ahead and read it. Skip scenes you don't like - it's ok. It's absolutely worth it.
B000JVT092|1.0|This was a terrible movie.  I don't even remember buying this but Amazon said I did back in 2006.  I'm sure the quality was nice, that is until HD DVD went away...
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|OMG this calculater is absolutely amazing.  I mean I can do almost anything in this calculator. You should totally buy it
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|My husband really love this game. He plays on then the kids. All the angy birds games are great.  Thanks!
B0092S4WLY|4.0|I like this game it makes you really thank what you are doing. its enjoyable to play. it's fun for every one.
B002YCVX5S|5.0|For Tarantino fans, it's well worth it.  It's nonstop violence, action, and intrigue.  If your looking for the movie that will kick your ass, this is it.  Bonjourno.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Good acting by everyone. Great special effects. Fun entertainment with an interesting twist at the end. I did not see it coming.
B003WUYRGI|4.0|Blab blah blah blah confiscating in eggs<br />Gangdam and alive piano music and bouncing around for my little girl who was in the game
0307476073|5.0|This book helped inspire me onto walk the Camino.  It made crossing Spain, sound like a walk in the park...and it is compared to what this woman went through.  Way to go, Cheryl!
B000H4TX9I|5.0|One of my favorite shows ever! Hope they revive it again someday. If you have not viewed, you are missing something terrific!
B006M4F67A|5.0|I know I just bought this awhile ago but I had a lot of fun playing this game! I like Mahjong and It's a great Matching game. It's a good game for the mind and it's keeps you entertained!
B005G5PPGS|4.0|Loved all the insights, but thought it dragged on a bit more than it needed to, especially as it related details of players past lives.
B008EKOO46|4.0|A facacinating book about many development as impactedby his surroundings. A different way of looking at how we came to be what we are. Not seriously appreciaated by experts in the field but at least broadening the possible make up of how we got to be how we are.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like that they update the game every 4 weeks or so by adding different cities. It's a simple game that's easy for my 3-year-old daughter to play and actually, we both seem to have learned a few things about some of the cities that have been featured! Pretty cool!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE EXTRA CORDS AND THE PRICE IS GOOD. I KEEP ONE FOR TRAVEL AND ONE AT HOME.
B00DHHWY9I|5.0|I am starting to believe DiCaprio is the best actor alive,..this movie confirms what I thought after watching him in Romeo and Juliet a few years back,..he's an artist, rare in recipe weary Hollywood,  not just a Grecian urn of a gorgeous face, frozen in neurotic preciosity, like Ben Affleck or Harrison Ford, he is truly unique and impossible to categorize. I say, appreciate him while he's in our midst,..or, as Jesus famously told Judas \\"you'll be sorry when I'm gone\\", yeah, that's in the Babo, only you never actually read those fairy tales to which you entrust your eternal soul, so you think, like Sir Yorick, I'm jesting. OK, sorry if I perturbed the dwindlings that still believe in talking snakes, but, seriously:<br />  There is a beautiful moment near the beginning, if you love the book you will know this part: \\"He smiled understandingly--much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced--or seemed to face--the whole external world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself...\\" In this scene the camera zooms in and I swear DiCaprio was Gatsby in that moment, the way I envisioned him ever since I first read the book in high school english. I was crying like a newborn baby, I couldn't believe anyone else, besides me,...\\"understood\\" what a wonderful, momentous event in 'psychological' literary history had taken place, Freud and Dostoevsky notwithstanding.  Ok, hyperbolic me, you're thinking. (that sounds like a great song title, eh? YOU have my permission to use it)<br />I recommend: if this movie you like, read the Last Tycoon by the same author, and RUN, don't walk, to rent DiCaprio's Romeo and Juliet.<br />Pros: excellent casting! sumptuous sets, tons of creativity in music and mood, and through it all they stayed true to the book--which is a new pair-of-dimes, or as you pedants would say, \\"paradigm\\", the meaning of which has eluded me since that day all the windows blew out in my philosophy101 class at UNLV due to the Pepcon Blast.<br />Cons: if you have a sub-average IQ (read o.b.a.m.a.p.h.o.n.e) you won't 'get' the movie or the book. This is not a put-down, I just want to save you time and money so you can,..say,...enjoy a 10 dollar Vegas buffet, replete with wine and hints of sexual encounters that your loyal family, back in California, will never find out about. After all, you are their hero, come to Vegas on an important Convention, because you are a serious man, with a suit and tie, and self-improvement books in your briefcase, a real life Dick Diver, only on the south-bound train.
B00CUWWLWG|1.0|UI love this game. However if you download for iPhone after I hit level 29 I lost all of the 50 some groups from each element as well as my 400,000 seeds and nectar and my almost 300 aurora.  I have never been able to access my friends on the social and am sure if this going to be fixed. If it gets fixed by all means it would be a 5 star game. But I'm honestly not happy and I'm testing out android and Facebook to see if the same thing happens. I also dislike that I have emailed customer care and gotten no response whatsoever.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Provocative and well researched it is a refreshing contextual journey through the mid east of the first century. It's good to meet this historical Jesus stripped of dogma and politics but still full of charisma
B006WPWH4E|3.0|BORING AND DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH JAZZ TO IT.  SHOULD BE MORE LIKE WINDOWS.  WILL TRY IT IT A LITTLE LONGER.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Great!! Nothing more needed to say whether you like it or not just to use so many words- get it!!!!!
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|I have always been a fan of Fall Out Boy, and this cd does not disappoint. It is a lot of fun to listen to and mixes their old lyrics with a new sound.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|You can't find a bad track on this album. Imagine Dragons just rolls through each song like it was meant to compliment the one before and set you up for the one after. Great album!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|its such a fun game. I always have a race with my sisiter on its and her phone so we can see who is better at it and it is me.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|Everything costs real money. Lame for an app that seems geared for kids in many ways. Don't waste your time.
B00742BVW8|5.0|This is one of the standards by which all epic movies should be judged.  Crouching Tiger was a four star movie, but Hero is a five star movie.
B00932A4XE|4.0|Funny chic flick great actors I recommend it for a lazy day with some popcorn if u like babies and preggers
B003Z6WFWC|5.0|The movie highlights the journey of a debate team from a small Negro college. That journey takes them from the obscurity of Marshall, Texas, to the limelight of Harvard University. Denzel Washington brings out the best in the other cast members. In fact, we believe more often than not that he is the actual professor for the students on the screen. This movie paints higher education in the rightfully prestigious light in which it should be painted. It's great to see a host of intelligent Black men using the power of words to impact their world. We need to see more of this. Yes, many intelligent Black men have and still do change our world for the better.
B009GX69RK|5.0|This show makes me laugh. I find the characters endearing and quirky. One of my favorite shows on television and an instant mood lift.
B000VDUWMC|5.0|Well-Organized and rational. He takes a mind-boggling amount of information and presents it logically and in a linear fashion.  Tight writing.  I never thought I'd enjoy this book but now wish I'd started it years ago!<br /><br />Joseph McKeever
B002A9VJ40|5.0|Awesome flashback to my youth.  Have always loved this movie, and the cheesiness just makes it even better as an adult.  &#34;I feel the need, the need, for speed!&#34;
B00CE3IC74|5.0|I ordered these due to purchasing the Google Play Galaxy S4, and I wanted to start using it to simply some tasks when I get to work, home, etc. I've used two of them, plus the keychain, and they work great. I'm using NFC Task Launcher from the Google Play Store and I've been able to write and rewrite tags as I've wanted to. Would definitely recommend.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Seeing as it is near impossible for me to have a horse this little game reminds me of why I want one in the first place!
B005EZJ3MW|5.0|it was still in the plastic wrapper so its perfect!!! love the cd glad that it is brand new :)
B0094M2ODQ|5.0|Love Barbara she is so much fun to watch over and over again! This is no an R rated movie so it was refreshing to watch the love story without the distractions.
B00BTJMS1A|4.0|I got this when it was the free app of the day a while back. It's a great game and it was a fun concept, however once you beat it, the re-playability is basically null. It was super fun and addicting while it was lasted, but once I beat it, outside of going for high scores, there are not any other goals to pursue..
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I am shocked that my favorite person more then likely got killed off....so sad but I have hope since there would be some major lose ends.
B00DSTBMMU|2.0|Sheryl Crow's 8th studio album \\"Feels Like Home\\", is just a little better than her last 3 albums, but that's not saying much.  She's gone country-pop, but this sound could get old pretty quick, you get her top 15 hit in \\"Easy',  but the 3 best numbers are \\"Best Of Times\\", \\"Nobody's Business\\" and \\"Shotgun\\".  This is a far cry from her best albums in the 90's.  Nice cover by the way.
B006FTCH2E|5.0|This movie had two great story lines intertwined.  Another Earth kept you thinking through the whole movie.  Excellent surprise ending.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I read a few reviews that said this app was as fun as or even more fun  than Temple Run. I was sceptical, but after playing it non stop for a few hours, I have to say I agree with those reviewers. This app is awesome, you should give it a try.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I didn't love this book but I did finish it.  I didn't feel that need to know or need to finish the book until the last 25%.  The ending (if you can call it that) left me curious about the next book but I am not sure that I will read it.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Excellent! Hosseini is a magical story- teller. Be prepared to be absorbed in the Afghani life and culture. Hard to put down.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|We bought this for hunting and ended up using it for the kitchen, fishing, hunting, etc. Does not dull out fast and works as intended. It is a good quality material (as it looks like in picture). I would love to say more but it works like it should and have no complaints. Knives come out razor sharp. I have owned it for roughly a year now.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I really am enjoying this game. I love ho games that offer more to them and this one is definitely different. Not just a ho game but there are also quests to complete. If you only like playing ho games that have no story line or quests to complete, this is not the game for you. If, however you are like me, you will enjoy this game.  =)
B0058OUJA4|5.0|This game hits on all cylinders for me.  The challenge remains while you learn how to play the game, plus there are different difficulty levels. There are a variety of maps, which makes you really use your brain to figure out the optimal strategy.  Lots of fun--high recommended!
B000BISBDY|5.0|There is no one like the man in black.  This is an awesome collection of Johnny Cash's music, and just what I was looking for.  I would highly recommend this CD/download.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I am a gamer on any platform and in every sense of the word so find this game to play on my kindle at work was a treat.  I am still shocked that it is free-to-play!  If you love a good game then you NEED to check this one out now.
1490313370|3.0|Someone recommended I read this book so I did.  There were a few good ideas in there, but the content wasn't anything earth shattering.  A lot of common sense.  The book was OK.
B000056VJ7|5.0|Paradise by the dashboard lights is my all time favorite!<br />Awesome overall and great price. My friends all have borrowed it at least once.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Fun game, always  have something to do so there is never a dull moment!! Can add people that aren't on your Facebook s friends which is great too.
B000JIHP88|4.0|Love this mobile it is just what I was looking for. Well worth the price and the moving pieces with lights.
B009IF8CH6|4.0|The Wolowitz character is over the top this season with sexual comments. The show doesn't need it. It's great without it.
B007ZGO7EM|2.0|This calculator was too basic for most of my needs. I deleted the App after a few tries. It may be good for simple calculations, but it did not offer any special capabilities. I deleted it after a few attempts to find better capability.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Great game but delays a lot and you lose chips. Daily tournament is really fun<br />And free which is nice. Slots are also fun
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Solid app, not necessarily so user friendly. A bit too many ads, but it tells you what you need to know.
B001BC5HXG|3.0|Stylistically, I've got to say that this book is classic, but I never identified with any of the characters the way I did with 'Grapes of Wrath.'  The characters were too aloof for me to be comfortable with any of them, much less care about them.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This App gave me the status and predictions I needed for my recent trip. I have used the weather channel many times in the past and would recommend it for most needs.
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|I don't know if I'll write more reviews...too many words required.<br /><br />Oblivion was not a great movie. Acting was pretty good, but the plot was not well developed.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Best one so far never have I read something more awesome than this book can't wait to read mockingjay.<br />This was so good
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Hubby likes to have a variety of watches and this on fit the bill. We didn't need to spend much on it and is a nice addition to his collection.
B006BFK5DK|4.0|Sometimes you just need to listen to good music. This collection meets that need. Recommended to all who agree. Enjoy!
0062206281|5.0|I read this book on my tablet, checked out from the library, because I was too impatient for the copy I ordered with two day shipping to come in. The only reason I don't love this book, like I do the other two, is that the book ended just as I felt the story was beginning. Because I read it on my tablets browser I wasn't ever really aware of how much of the book I had read, or had left to read percentage or page wise. I really couldn't believe it ended when action seemed to just be starting. However, it is still beautifully written and I will impatiently wait for the next one.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Love this app but every time someone doesn't get a card or put down a card it timeouts and takes forever but everything else is awesome you should get this game.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This book is hard to put down. I loved the whole series.  I can't wait for the movie.  Buy it!
B000IZ4R1U|1.0|I respect the director and his crew, but the movie was too cheesy, and the acting was to stiff. As if They how'd a supermodel to simply be a supermodel.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|You have to love a show that stars Richard Dean Anderson and makes a MacGyver reference in the very first episode.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is a book I could not put down.  It is not your usual plot or setting.  Characters are well drawn and enjoyable.<br /><br />Read it this weekend!!
B008N1LL42|5.0|Great graphics. Full of action and suspense. Loved the bits of comedy. It was a salute to the U.S. Navy and veterans
B00EI6E17A|5.0|I really hope the rest of this release has the chops, the is a great song by a talented artist
B003L20IHE|5.0|Look, this is simply an enjoyable movie with a standard theme (\\"boy meets girl/boy saves girl\\"), nice looking kids and an age old plot. But it is filmed in a beautiful setting, with acting good enough to allow you to escape for a couple of hours. For that, I give it top marks!
B005H9B44A|5.0|This movie is so much fun to watch and is well made. enough eye candy for the ladies as well :D
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this, I can't stop playing......this game will keep you playing for hours and hours on end.  Think you will like it also.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun game that will keep you thinking. You have to search everything everywhere! Good game! Looking forward to lots more rooms!
B000000OQF|4.0|O.K., so this is one of 7 CDs I am replacing after a devastating fire some years back. I find that I have changed somewhat in those four years, so allow me a bit of leadway here. For me, this album remains an essential keeper for those who enjoyed the music of Guns N Roses. It was also the one that sent them skyrocketing in the heavy metal music market.  Thereafter, they had to try and emulate/replicate this work. Slash is terrific and Axl is at his finest. Many of the songs are highly melodic with strong messages. For the more guttural stuff, chalk it up to youthful exuberance. I wouldn't want my kids talking that way, but it does get some of their thinking across. Later, it was just their brains having become addled by drugs and booze!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|101 in 1 games is a game about cordination and skill and its great for everyone that I know. I like the game because it makes me want to see it to the end. I would deffinitly recommend this to kids 4+
B008ZDC7M8|5.0|I´m knocked out. This is definitely a must for film lovers. Mark Cousins has created a seldom seen reference work!
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|I liked Dredd but it was a little over the top, it was much less cheesy than the Stallone version but some of the situations were over the top and there was a little bit of gore to it.
B00000273M|5.0|I'd recommend this album to fans of the Bangles, lovers of '80's pop-rock and for others who enjoy an album with good rock movement and energy levels. For me, there isn't a single song that does not flow comfortably and smoothly, helping me escape the rigors of everyday life! One of my favorites remains their rendition of Paul Simon's &#34;Hazy Shade of Winter&#34; made esp. popular in the 1987 film: &#34;Less Than Zero&#34;.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I love it! Great story line, and great actors. Can't wait for season 5.thank you Amazon for giving us great movies and tv
B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|Yet again rebooting/twisting old stories into new ones.  Still, they did a very good job with it.  Definitely worth watching.
B000AP04NI|5.0|As I was born and raised in Oklahoma, this has always been one of my favorites.  A good DVD to buy.
B000BW7QX6|5.0|This movie was awesome!!! Finished up what the series started. I loved every minute of this film. The movie gave me all of the answers to all of my questions and it ended great!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|A great book full of adventure and action best book yet. Cant wait until another one of yhese mythological books come out.
B0054VVRBQ|5.0|I love this device. Works exactly as expected in my Macbook Pro! The SD card sits flush with the exterior, meaning no danger of breakage. I sometimes forget I have an SD card in there. It's worth a buy!
B000URDCC6|5.0|the DVD was in great shape.  I received it in the proper time frame. I do love this film, thank you.l
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series is one of the best I've bought in a long time. I only wish it had not been cancelled. It has a cult following and we all miss it.  Everyone should own it or their sci-fic collection is not complete.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|This game Sucks!<br />I wish I have never downloaded it. Now it keep coming up on my screen by itself. I wonder if it is a bug?
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|This did not translate well....having to slide around and try to aim it on the tablet really doesn't work very well. Exactly worth the price paid. I played with it a couple of times and removed it.
B005NFJAZS|5.0|A favorite of mine for a long time.  So glad to get it on DVD, as I already had it on VHS.
015204907X|4.0|I like this but not quite as much as Ten Little Fingers and Ten Little TOes - which we absolutely love. But another cute book by the same author.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Quiet gave me a whole new understanding of myself and of many people around me.  I recommend it to all personality types.
B004EPYZSK|5.0|this movies combines two of my favorite genres: cowboys and aliens (hence the title). I got for my dad and he loved it!
B004XUMMFE|4.0|This SciFi series is better than most recurring series that are still on TV.  I'm with everyone else on this one: Why did this get shelved/canned/dumped, etc???
B00COCY67A|1.0|This is just one more way to make a buck. Don't waste your time. We have heard it all before.
B00A285OOW|5.0|The best one yet. It wasn't the ending that I was expecting either. Phillips Gregory is a master in historical interpretation.
B004EPYZT4|5.0|Great addition to a long line of Conan the Barbarian films. I would recommend it to all who enjoy action movies.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|The classic from the 70's is revamped and brought current with familiar antagonists brought forward into the new millenia.  Eccleston and Piper make a good duo for the Doctor and his nubile female travelling companion.  What's next... Dad's Army?
B00169N0BK|4.0|This product does what it says it will do. The on-screen step-by-step instructions are superb, and set-up is easy. I will echo what others have said and suggest that you give your test prints at least a hour to dry, especially if calibrating matte or art papers. The time it takes to match a paper type to a printer is fairly long (perhaps 90 minutes), but once it's done it's done and saved with a descriptive name.<br /><br />Be sure you know how to add icc profiles and how to prevent software color management from overriding the Color Munki profile before using this. I am using this with Photoshop Elements 9 with colors that finally come within 95% of a perfect match with my monitor, a result that is good enough without making multiple prints and adjusting color again and again, a very costly approach.<br /><br />Recommended.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is amazing and I read all of Rick Riodan's books. I can't wait for house of hades. I suggest everybody should read this book.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|this is a have to get for all gamers it's so cool. lf you are a marvel fan or just like mobile games. GET THIS NOW!!!!!
B009HUB40Y|5.0|great game fun to play fa s t and furious play colorful and bright lots of power ups with big booms and fire
B003G4W49C|3.0|Somewhat tedious and repetitive. The imagined future is compelling and well worked-out. The ending is surprising and satisfying. Later books in this saga are better.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I've been trying to compose this review ever since I reluctantly finished this deceptively simple book that actually transported me to Heaven.  But due to the serious nature of the subject matter, namely end-of-life issues, I've struck out trying to get my reading friends to read it, which is very frustrating.  I sincerely hope Amazon readers are braver.  You won't be sorry.  On the surface, this could be a My Fair Lady/Pygmalion story, where the wealthy parents of a recent paraplegic hires a village girl as a companion/watch dog for their son.  There's humor in the relationship that forms, along with a love story between these two mismatched people.  If it weren't for the fact that the author very subtly forces the reader to examine his or her opinions about life and death, as well as life-changing mistakes that can define us, I would have finished this marvel in one sitting.  But instead, I had to put it aside so I could think about these thought-provoking issues.  Please read this book and visit Heaven!  And bring tissues.
B0082SU98U|4.0|Such a nice read!<br /> I enjoyed it and couldn't wait to read the sequal. Good book overall a classic !
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|It is an incredible true story and testament to humanity in the worst of times. I absolutely loved the way Adam Makos intertwined the two stories into one. Culminating with the men meeting along with their families, who never would have existed had it not been for such a gallant act of chivalry.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I love this series, the acting is excellent and the story line is very interesting. My sister is watching it now also and we can't wait to see the next season!  I will definitely be ordering Season 3 once we finish Season 1.
B0000028WD|4.0|This is a very good concert with many stars performing some fine renditions of Bob Dylan's music. I enjoyed the cd and can recommend it to any Bob Dylan fan.<br /><br />John Walsh
B0089LOG02|5.0|Loved it...... Was a great book.. kept me captivated to the last page..<br />Great Read.. I would recommend this book
B004A8ZWSS|2.0|I love Johnny Depp, but I found this movie hard to follow.  Watched it twice to see if I would get it the second time - didn't happen.  Still love Johnny Depp - just don't like this movie.
B002APU580|5.0|I have always loved this version, and I am spoiled to anything else. Perfect example of how people's assumptions and actions can potentially ruin lives. There is nothing like explanation and honesty...spoken nicely, of course. Smart-alek retorts are for the birds.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|so happy when it loaded but would not let me play after I entered the park can't play I'm sure it is fun but olny one star sorry
B005K17RU0|4.0|This updated free weather app is a big improvement from the original that now gives me an easier interface, more detailed local weather and radar that was just what I needed!
B0079R8KXG|3.0|I would like to have the option of viewing my movies with the kindle in landacape position all while still being pluged into the power which is why a 360° rotation would be better.  The colors are great. This cover is a great fit, easy to snap in, looks nice and it is quite sturdy. One won't be able to recharge while having the lid over the screen. I still want to keep it because I think it has a lot of versitilaty and functionality along with being light, sturdy and good looking.
B00A285OOW|5.0|I have read almost all of Philippa Gregory's books.  She has a unique ability to bring history alive for the reader.  Her books are always fast paced (even though the events move slowly), and you have the feeling that you are experiencing the history in real time.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|fourth best app ever love love love this app well worth the $$$$$$$$$$$$ yeah this app is 3.00$ oh well this is a really Good makes me happy happy happy
1400031354|5.0|I'm new to this series, and so far I absolutely love it!  What a neat window into the African culture.  Mma Ramotswe is a clever and interesting character.  I'm enjoying being part of her adventures as a Lady Detective.
B000X2H8G4|1.0|got it so my dad could hear the tv better n it didnt work at all now i have no use for it
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I'm working my way thru the experiments and so far it's been amazing.  Why are there seven more words required to submit this review?
B004SBS8LA|5.0|this game is awesome awesome my third fav game. so cool so I also like bad piggies star wars and bacon
B003K025V4|5.0|Justin Beaver lock out!  your eYpleacement has arrived and his name is Desperation, i mean, Miley Cyrus!  Talk about printing monny out off air.  No talant, but can macke the news!  Me pour akey braky daughter!
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|If you are a Nicholas Sparks fan...you will love it movie.  I will add it to my collection of Nicholas Sparks movies and books.
B0042TV4IW|3.0|fine for someone who loves these &#34;how it used to be in England&#34; dramas (and i am one of them, But it is a little bland and seems derivative. Maybe I watched too much Upstairs Downstairs and Time Goes By in the past.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I live abroad and am constantly using this app to calculate the conversion of a price on something to US dollars.  I use it for so many things!  I'm basically lazy so I'd rather use a calculator than try to do the math in my head - this serves that purpose beautifully.
B00E3BK0QQ|3.0|For the price I would have expected this game to be a bit longer, or at the very least have some kind of a bonus. But, none of the above was included. This game is basically puzzles and tasks. There are three levels to choose from and you play with a game journal that shows your tasks and gives any necessary hints. There is a hint button that changes to a skip button for the puzzles if needed. This game does not include any ho scenes so those who prefer this genre without the ho scenes will enjoy this one. This game was on the short end as far as game time goes, and as I mentioned earlier there is no bonus chapters or anything else to do once the game is done so definitely play a bit with the demo to decide if you think it's worth the price.<br /><br />One thing that is worth mentioning to the devs is after every chapter the game nags you for a FIVE STAR review. For one thing I, like most players, prefer to wait till I am finished with a game before reviewing it. Also, I don't mind being asked once to review a game. But, it gets really annoying and tedious to be asked over and over and it's even worse (not to mention unethical) to be told the rating to put in my review. I always deduct a star when faced with this unethical practice, hence the reason for only three stars for this four star game.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I was trying to find a way to change the look of the tiles and am unable to do so. Is there a way to change the look of the tiles?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is perfect for any mighty klingon warrior looking to pass the time between destroying his enimes and drinking gallons of blood wine. I found this game while I was sifting through the corpses of the Romulan p'taks I had just slain singlehandedly. One possessed a device known as the firey tablet of kindle, upon it lie this wonderous game of which we now speak. I have since spent many hours attempting to complete the daily challenges and collect all the gold coins. This game is clearly worthy of 5 star systems and all the gold pressed latinum in the treasury. Glory to Kahless!
B0000VCZKW|5.0|This was my favorite movie as a kid, and now it has become my daughter's favorite movie as well. Every DVD collection needs to have this movie in it
B002TWWOHE|5.0|I recommend; can be viewed by entire family; interesting; good writing; excellent acting. The cast work well with each other and complement each other.
B008EKOIN8|3.0|I really wanted to like this book.. but found it a bit slow / hard to stay engaged.  While I am certainly more knowledgeable about bbq, crackling, and wheat bread - I didn't find this book to be on the same level as some of Pollan's others.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|By the time you reach the fourth season of this show you are probably already an addict. If not, then check this season out
B008K6HN8I|1.0|I read the reviews prior to downloading this app. I was under the impression that it was Amazing... After seeing how much control it has over my Kindle and how it's applicable to basically everything the devices uses I had my suspicions. I then decided to uninstall the app. After doing so it remained on my device and when I tried to uninstall... It says: &quot;I'm sorry but this item doesn't exist&quot; or something to that nature. I find no purpose for this app and it's a virus In my eyes. Don't download.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is a great way to pass the time.  The controls are easy to learn and the game goes quickly.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|This is an awesome show and each season gets better and better! I would highly recommend this show for anyone who loves suspense
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|As always the acting and story line are superb. I am sad that Matthew had to die though as I can't imagine Mary ever being nice again.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|Lots of fun. I've playing match games like these. This is my second time through this game &amp; it's still a lot of fun.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I played this game on my desk top computer and spent a lot of time with it.  Saw it on my kindle, downloaded it and I still spend lots of time with it.  I really love this game.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I watched the show first on Netflix which inspired me to read the book.The book was definitely less shocking, (many liberties taken by writers and producers to &#34;spice&#34; it up), but well written and riveting!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love it! So helpful. I'm pinning stuff all the time. Food. Ratios. Decorating. Organizing. Kids stuff. Landscaping. U name it!
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is a very nice game.  I use it when I can or when I'm not playing spider, bowling, or candy crash
B005BEIDCM|5.0|I re-read these books as a nostalgia trip having loved them when I was quite small.  The first one still has all the magic of what I remembered, and the second was also good - just.  The best thing Eleanor H Porter did was to stop after book 2.  The sunshine kid and her glad game needs to morph into a more adult philosophy of life, but that takes the book out of the reach of children and makes it something quite different.<br /><br />I enjoyed both of them. I am glad I have been able to download copies of them, and I look forward to introducing them to my granddaughter when she is old enough.  No girl should grow up without knowing Pollyanna - along with a whole lot of other books.

B009NQKPUW|2.0|convoluted story, should have had a intro on how they got into problem. Solutions didn't make sense. Probably is one of those movies that have to be watched several times .

0385343248|5.0|Awesome epic about traditional Japanese Samurai. Very long book, great to take on vacation or just get lost in another world.
B00AFCEIB0|2.0|I did not like the google app. It did not work for me. I deleted it  from my kindle fire.
B00C6B9XCW|5.0|This movie is awesome. Plus the steel book looks gorgeous on my media stand and the price was perfect. Great buy.
0525478817|4.0|Read this after a friend recommended it, and am glad I did so.  It tells a story about the poignancy of life without delving too deeply beyond the world of the here-and-now, in the way teenagers tend to live and view everything.  Thought it would end rather differently, and can't say I'm not a little disappointed by that - but, still, the story as a whole is truly touching and inadvertently gives hope to the reader that every moment does matter, and that life is too often taken for granted.  Definitely recommend the book to those who enjoy young-adult humor and cynicism.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Movie was good.  If you did not watch the movies that lead up to this one, you will be lost in who the players are and why they act the way they do.  Not that it is all that important -- it is a superhero movie after all.
0688014291|5.0|It was the first book I read on managing  when I began my career in management. I require all managers who report to me read it. A fabulous, easy to understand book.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|Needed this for a media player I use in the car for the kids. The output of the media player wasn't quite enough to hear over the road noise of the car, but this little amplifier could push it to the hurt your ears points, so great device.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Great way to watch cable without the high  fees. Like the shw. Brit mysteries are the BEST. Actors are gritty.
B000F4RHB6|5.0|Its Huey Lewis and the News, what more can I say, you either like the music it or you don't, but they are up beat enough for just about any occasion, but not so overbearing you can only handle the 'noise' for a couple songs.
B005COO1X6|4.0|I LOVE Stephen King.  For a short story, it kept me in suspense.  His imagination, descriptive writing, and gift for pulling you into every story he writes never ceases to amaze me - that's why he's the King.  I would have preferred a different ending instead of everyone that survived skipping off into the sunset after your loved ones are dead, but I thinks it's because I wanted to continue reading more of this story.  However, can't beat the price for the excellent writing and storyline he provides.
B00ECU2SGS|2.0|Movie somewhat disappointing, could have been much better.  Reese Wiherspoon's screen time was simply a cameo.  Did not convey Mud's obsession with her.  This obsession was key to his predictament, and the script did not flesh it out.  Ending was far fetched and too Hollywood pat.  This could have been a great movie.  Disappointing.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Great insight on the life of a SEAL in war and at home. The skill sets and determination of a SEAL is incredible. Thanks to Chris Kyle and Taya for sharing their life with us.  Knowing now that Chris Kyle lost his life here at home in Texas is so sad. He served for our freedom and we are forever thankful. We hope the very best for Taya and their children. May God enrich their lives. Thank you for the book. Great book to read and share with others.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|These two always have me waiting anxiously for the nest Pendergast installment. This book was no different. Outstanding story and amazing character development. I cannot wait to see where they take this series next.

B00CV5ZPA2|4.0|I have never been a Kanye fan until now (like many other reviewers). When I first heard this album, I was blown away. The production is spot on. Kanye brought something really different to the table, and I'm impressed. The prime inspiration for this album was Architecture, and that really interests me. It steers far away from the traditional inspiration of mainstream rap, which is usually money, drugs, and women. If you're a huge Kanye fan, and not just someone who enjoys his radio hits, this album is for you.<br /><br />I'll start with the production on the album:<br />As stated early, the production is excellent. If I could describe this album's production in one word, it'd be creative. Kanye avoided a \\"Dubstep sound\\", but still kept a nice dirty sound to his beats. The production really shines on the following songs:<br />On Sight<br />I Am A God<br />Blood On The Leaves<br />Bound 2<br /><br />5/5 for the production. It's fresh. It's creative. It's fun.<br /><br />Lyricism and delivery:<br />There are different types of lyrics and delivery methods when it comes to Hip Hop music. Kanye is no Tech N9ne or Eminem on this album. I found Kanye's delivery and lyrics to be relatively simple, but that's no bad thing. Music doesn't have to be complex to be good. Kanye has direct lyrics and gets the point across. Topics include being a god, sadness and betrayal, love and lust, and racism. Auto Tune is used correctly and sparingly. Most notably on the songs \\"Blood On The Leaves\\" and \\"Guilt Trip\\". I'll be frank, I hate artists like T-pain. So, I was grateful to see that this wasn't going to be a complete album sung in auto tune.<br /><br />5/5 for the lyrics and delivery.<br /><br />Album Length:<br />Although this usually isn't a category that's reviewed traditionally when it comes to music, I found it pretty necessary to mention this. The album is short. Too short. From my understanding, the original version was 3 hours long. Kanye had Rick Rubin strip it down 15 days prior to release. We're missing over 2 hours of material here.<br /><br />3/5 for that. I felt that there was so much missing while listening to the CD.<br /><br />Aside from album length, this album delivers. Fans of all backgrounds will love it.
B00ENCF4VQ|5.0|im not gonna  make this a spoiler. to deserve this masterpiece and understand how powerful it is you must start from the beginning. I can only say from the beginning I learned fast not to fall in love with one character. this is drama at its best, that said the minute u adore a character, there are twist and turns that may make u cry. bravo to steven de knight

B001DUDKEY|3.0|It was ok...but I think I would have liked more PLOT. A little more true history would have been nice too.
B00A83075M|5.0|For a number of years now, especially since the \\"If you can't beat 'em, join 'em!\\" switch over to all computer generated animation for their feature films, Disney has appeared content to let Pixar, Dreamworks, and various other more ambitious upstart animation studios slug it out for Number One while they toodled along under the radar, producing good but not great computer generated animation films.  In fact it often seemed that Disney didn't really know what to do with computer generated animation, since most of their computer generated feature films looked like they could have been done about as well in old-fashioned ink and cell format.  Well, that all came to an end with this film, a remarkably brilliant, in part because it was such a surprise, combination of story AND computer generated format.<br /><br />Not unlike Pixar's Toy Story series, the premise of Wreck-It Ralph is that video game characters are alive and have lives outside arcade hours, along with certain video game character specific rules, like the fact that if you die OUTSIDE of your game, you stay dead, you don't regenerate, and the fact that \\"glitches\\", so-called \\"mistake\\" characters that allegedly aren't supposed to exist, cannot leave their games.  The movie begins with a hilarious parody of support groups as Wreck-It Ralph, the villain of the Fix-It Felix, Jr., video game, finally shows up to a meeting of BAD-ANON: One Game at a Time (Bad Guys Anonymous for video game bad guys) after years of being invited because it's the 30th anniversary of his game coming out, and he's feeling unappreciated and tired of being a bad guy.  Finding the hilarious parody \\"support\\" he receives from his fellow bad guys utterly useless, he returns to his game only to find that the other characters are having a 30th anniversary party...<br /><br />without inviting him.<br /><br />The upshot is that Ralph vows to do what no video game bad guy has ever done before: earn a medal.  A chance encounter gives him the opportunity to infiltrate  a brand new (and extremely violent and scary) video game Hero's Duty where after a hilariously awful first game, Ralph figures out a way to \\"earn\\" a medal, but in the process accidentally unleashes a threat that will destroy ALL of the games in the arcade if it isn't stopped in time.  With ultimate disaster looming, grim Calhoun of Hero's Duty (programmed with the most tragic back-story ever) and Fix-It Felix, Jr., himself must follow Ralph into another relatively new game Sugar Rush where glitch Vanellope von Schweetz has used Ralph's stolen medal to pay her entry fee into the nightly race that determines which character avatars are available for selection by the next day's players, forcing a resentful Ralph to do whatever he can to help Vanellope win in order to get his medal back.<br /><br />It's fun to try and recognize all of the real life video game antecedents reworked in here, and what makes it even more astonishing is when you realize that the story would never have worked if the writers had used the original video games and  characters that obviously (and sometimes not so obviously) inspired them rather than their \\"made up\\" but subtly different replacements.  This wasn't a case of avoiding a lawsuit or a license fee but rather a bunch of changes necessary to make the plot work.  In the end some gentle lessons are taught about the necessity of each job, appreciating the work of the people who do each necessary job, and the importance of doing your own necessary job.  More subtly much fun is had at the expense of some sacred cows, as Ralph gains satisfaction not from the selfish pursuit of meaningless medals or empty self-affirmations, but rather from sacrificing himself unselfishly to save someone else.  There's even a clever dig gotten in against the constitutional but highly questionable practice of using eminent domain for private interests buried in the Fix-It Felix, Jr., video game theme song.<br /><br />Sadly, Disney never quiterealized what they had, and it shows among other ways in the lack of a commentary track on this bare bones one disk DVD.  It would have been nice to listen to the creators pointing out the less obvious connections to real video games and calling attention to other in jokes, but maybe that will come in a future reissue, hopefully NOT on a Dual-Layer disc this time (\\"slight pause\\", my substantial rear end!)<br /><br />Note: Includes the sweet if highly illogical theatrical short \\"Paperman\\".realized what they had, and it shows among other ways in the lack of a commentary track on this bare bones one disk DVD.

B00340O3KQ|1.0|This movie was too foul for me. I could not watch it for very long because of the offensive language.
B00DHHFKE4|4.0|A really interesting look inside the prison system. I found it heart-warming and inspirational without being cliche. I also enjoyed the fact that, although based on the characters from this book, the netflix series has taken a different direction. This means that neither medium ruins the other so the consumer gets twice the pleasure!!
0671646788|4.0|I picked this book up a few years back during my busy travel season and thoroughly enjoyed it. I gave it 4 stars since it didn't really cover that many new ideas.
B000002LQR|4.0|This is the album where the RHCP's really hit the mainstream so there are a lot of recognizable songs on here. Everyone should listen to this album at least once.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very late display on my kindle and easy to use. Does everything I need it to do. Highly recommend this app.
1589795474|2.0|So I bought this book as this book was mentioned in the review of another book (Millionaire Teacher). I bought both the books.<br />This book talks about the same thing over and over and over. It talks about some common sense things - live below your means, don't spoil your kids by helping them financially etc but it doesn't tell you how can you grow your money like - invest in stocks/bonds/real estate etc. It tells you don't do this, don't do that etc. It talks about being Frugal but come on, use your common sense. After reading it for some time it feels like a collection of surveys, which are very old.<br />Also, the data included in this book is old, very old. For example - on one of the pages the author writes - in a recent survey (conducted in 1995).. 1995 was 18 years back so if the authors planned to publish new edition they should have updated the data. All those tables in the book are outdated and useless.<br /><br />The tagline for this books says \\"The Surprising Secrets of America's Wealthy\\" - Oh well.. I didn't find any..<br /><br />So instead of wasting your time and money go to your library and spend 25-30 mins and glance over the books.

1439190976|4.0|'The Firm' is an up-to-date history of McKinsey, an American firm that has had a profound effect on the ways businesses operate, as well as staffing corner offices and boardrooms around the world. We don't know much about McKinsey, the firm's standard contract says 'The client agrees that it will not use McKinsey's name, refer to McKinsey work, or make the Deliverables or the existence or terms of this agreement available outside its organization without McKinsey's prior written permission.'<br /><br />McKinsey competitors include Boston Consulting Group (emphasizes its 'experience curve' and 'growth matrix' products), Bain & Co. (works with only one client in an industry group), A.D. Little, Booz Allen, and others. About 85% of its $7 billion in annual revenues comes from repeat customers, certainly a strong signal of customer satisfaction. Famous alumni (out of 19,000) include Lous Gerstner (American Express, IBM), Harvey Golub (American Express, Campbell Soup) Bobby Jindal (Louisiana governor), Michael Jordan (Westinghouse, CBS, EDS), Tom Peters ('In Search of Excellence'), Sheryl Sandberg (Facebook). More current and former Fortune 500 CEOs are McKinsey alumni than of any other company.<br /><br />McKinsey was found in 1926. Four years earlier, his 'Budgetary Control' book advocated that, instead of setting a budget bsed on projected expenses, one should first create a business plan and then set the budget that would allow achieving it - a revolutionary notion at the time. In its early history, founder James ('Mac') McKinsey, an accountant, landed Marshal Field as a client in 1935. At the time, Field was facing a big loan payment and deep in red ink. McKinsey's solutions involved selling off a wholesale business and some textile mills, then cutting costs. Marshall Field's directors liked his plan so much they persuaded Mac to wield the as himself. Known thereafter as the 'McKinsey Purge,' the 1,200 layoffs set the precedent for many more future downsizings. 'There is a distinct possibility that McKinsey may be the single greatest legitimizer of mass layoffs of anyone, anywhere, at any time in modern history.'<br /><br />Mac McKinsey, however, wasn't the man who shaped McKinsey into what it is today, but Marvin Bower, a lawyer. His vision was that consultants should put client interests ahead of the firm's. In addition, he recruited only top graduates from Harvard Business School with likable personalities, and insisted on top standards of attire. They were expected to join local boards, get involved in charities - community relations was a business strategy. His McKinsey men weren't industry experts, but generalists with rational thinking. Bower directed that all consultants share in a single pool of company earnings, not just that of their office - this encouraged talent to move freely and encouraged  cooperation.<br /><br />G.E. hired McKinsey in 1968 to review its strategic planning, and its recommendations (restructure the conglomerate's 360 departments into 50 strategic business units that focused outwardly on external market forces rather than just inwardly on cost management) helped future CEO Welch reach his accomplishments. And McKinsey helped launch banking industry consolidation in 1986 when it assisted Wells Fargo's acquisition of Crocker bank.<br /><br />Not every McKinsey engagement was a success, however. McKinsey provided advice that some say led to the first too-big-to-fail bank failure - that of Continental Illinois Bank in the 1980s. During that same time period, instead of addressing the Japanese threat directly through increased productivity and quality, and design simplification, McKinsey instead counseled reorganization and people shuffling. Enron was another unsuccessful McKinsey client, for 18 years. And then there's been the more recent involvement of some of its leaders (Anil Kuman, Rajat Gupta) in securities fraud. And guess who lobbied vigorously for the disastrous Time Warner-AOL merger. It told AT&T in 1980 that the U.S. market for cellphones would amount to only 900,000. (Nonetheless, AT&T paid McKinsey $96 million over five years in the 1990s.) And McKinsey wasn't able to save KMart, though it is doubtful anyone could have.<br /><br />Despite now having 17,000 employees (9,000 consultants) in 102 offices in 50 countries with experience in advanced electronics, aerospace/defense, automotive, financial services, healthcare systems, public sector, telecommunications, etc., author McDonald is doubtful about the company's long-term prospects. Besides having several fierce rivals, it's played no role in the emergence of titans such as Apple and Google.<br /><br />The attractiveness of consultants has declined. AT&T had as many as 300 from McKinsey, BCG, and Bain running around its offices over a period of decades, sometimes paying nearly $1 billion in consulting fees/year - now  it has eliminated most of those uses. Likewise, Ford and others have greatly reduced their use. Paying $1,500+ for rank-and-file consultants, many fresh out of business school, is no longer just 'accepted,' and clients are demanding discounts.<br /><br />Perhaps McKinsey has become more a Kansas medicine man than the great and powerful Oz of American business it purports to be.ld AT&T in 1980 that the U.S. market for cellphones would amount to only 900,000.

B005D9MUWY|2.0|Doesn't add anything to the keyboard experience. Clunky layout, tries to predict slang too much. Tracks a lot of phone data, and eats more battery. It is not any better than swype.

B00B52FDXQ|5.0|Farewell to Spartacus!<br /><br />Though Liam McIntyre could never replace Andy Whitefield he paid excellent tribute with this last season.  We find resolution in the fates of most of the major characters and have a spark of home in the end.  I loved this show and am sad it came to an end after only a handful of seasons but I'd rather that then the show die a slow death and the hands of a lagging plot line.  This was an excellent final season the cast and crew can be proud of.  Buy it.<br /><br />I AM SPARTACUS!
0345803507|5.0|I love this book!. I read it not knowing what to expect! But it is now my new favorite book (trilogy)
B00C2PO09I|5.0|I love Jim Strurgess so I knew I'd love this film.<br /><br />Visually breathtaking, if nothing else you will enjoy the cinematography.  The plot is intriguing but does have some holes so a suspension of belief is necessary.  If you can put aside aforementioned plot issues this movie will give you a lot to think about and speaks to the devastating issues that come with a society segregated (for any reason).<br /><br />Worth having in your collection, if only for a rainy day.  I loved it.
0399255370|5.0|I thought this looked cute, bought it for my 5- and 8- year old great niece and nephew, and we all enjoyed reading it over and over, laughing every time.  Good clean fun!!!  I'm now going to buy one for each of the other families.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It's a nice change from the cop-and-weird-gifted-partner and reality shows.  I signed up for Amazon Prime just to be able to watch the second and thrid seasons since Netflix only had the first.  Has drama, humor, and an ample helping of sarcasm, and Maggie Smith and Shirley McClaine are a hoot.
140006922X|4.0|Overall this was a very well done book and I did learn a few things I did not know, although much of it was repetitive of other books I have read.  To be fair to the author I've studied this subject somewhat in depth.  I did find the writing to be presented in an interesting and readable way.  He especially did a good job on presenting the history of the times that might give insight on how Jesus'  contemporary's may have viewed Him.  The book is not for the deeply religious figure that feels the Bible is the literal Word of God.  I think given the topic Reza is sensitive to peoples feelings and yet remains faithful to the historical facts as we can understand them.  While he gives us his take he also manages in the book and through his notes  to present scholars opinions who may differ with his.

B0013TTLDE|5.0|Another one of Morton's amazing books. This is probably my favorite. Full of historic events in early 20th century English society; mysterious and breathtaking. You will spend many sleepless nights once you get into this book. Kate Morton has become one of my favorite writers. This is just another one of her classics.
B002RPR6DU|4.0|This has long been a cult favorite of mine. The special effects won't dazzle today's kids, raised on CG graphics. But the setting is believable, and the robots are quite endearing. Bruce Dern was the gold standard for characters that lived on the lunatic fringe in the 70's. Great story, somewhat bittersweet ending. The message carries as much urgency now as it did then.
B008L5G4I8|5.0|The book is a wonderful spellbinding. I would recommend it to all mystery lovers. I own several of her books and have reread most at least once.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I Love it. This newer version is much easier to use than the last one. I spend hours on it.
B0073V7YTY|2.0|I didnt know if there was a shut off, hence it drained the battery of my kindle,  not really sure it worked
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I'm fond of studying history and especially this period in England, but really, do all the sex scenes have to have so much bouncing and yelling. We could have the story told as well without the distracting sex scenes and let those who get their emotions up by watching that turn to their porn movies. Yes, there are still some of us who enjoy good drama without all the sex. Historical questions I have seen and heard in other reviews, why the short haircuts on the guys and sister Margret's marriage to the King of Portugal and her smothering him in the pillow. I understand poetic license but appreciate more historical accuracy. Overall very entertaining and a pretty good take on the period of history.

B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Laughter, cheers, tears and sadness all rang through my body reading this book.  What a phenomenal story about Adam.  I'm taking with me this; no matter what...Love God, Love your Family and Love your country.  Thank you Adam for lifting me up!
B00DNDR29I|4.0|In a just world, her fans say, Janelle Monae would be a superstar. She's got that versatile type of showmanship (great singer, songwriter, dancer, visual presence, etc) that sadly isn't around much in pop music anymore. What's more, she's quirky, intelligent, and filled with enough sincere emotion to make her a much more special addition to our culture than a mere entertainer. So what gives? Why isn't \\"Electric Lady\\" embraced by the masses like it's the next \\"Thriller?\\" Why did an art-pop diva like Lady Gaga break so big, yet a similarly postmodern stylist like Janelle gets a much more subdued reception despite great critical acclaim?<br /><br />Janelle seems to know the answer, but she hasn't totally come to terms with it. For all her conceits about android dramas and sectioned suites, she knows that getting hips to sway is a big part of the game in the pop market. She says it herself: \\"the booty don't lie,\\" and the song from which that lyric comes (Q.U.E.E.N.) serves as proof that Ms. Monae can be great at moving bodies when she wants to. But while her second LP \\"The Electric Lady\\" is noticeably more head-bobbin and song-centric than her full-length debut \\"The ArchAndroid,\\" popular digestibility still plays second fiddle to her vision for high-concept musical narratives.<br /><br />There is a 45-minute pop masterpiece lurking within the sprawling 67 minute \\"Electric Lady\\" LP, and it's mostly found on the first half (Suite 4 of her larger Metropolis work). Songs like \\"Q.U.E.E.N.,\\" \\"Dance Apocalyptic,\\" \\"Give Em What They Love\\" (a fabulously funky grind with Prince), \\"Prime Time,\\" and the title track, to name a few examples, showcase Monae at her finest: forward-thinking yet effortlessly enjoyable. The second half of the LP is composed mostly of slower jams, but tracks like \\"Sally Ride,\\" \\"Victory,\\" \\"Dorothy Dandridge Eyes,\\" and \\"What an Experience\\" are quite strong as well. The rest of the songs are not bad per se, but they don't add much except to the album's epic length.  It's her tendency toward overkill that has kept her from enjoying greater fame. Why not save such tracks for a supplementary EP?<br /><br />Janelle's already released two albums that have been compared to Prince's double-album \\"Sign o'the Times.\\" But as sprawling and ambitious as that one was, keep in mind that it was Prince's ninth album! He released four \\"simple\\" albums full of hits before any concepts or double-LPs were introduced. You have to win the hearts of the masses before you can start to challenge them with higher concepts. And the world is still waiting for Janelle's \\"Purple Rain.\\" In edited form, \\"Electric Lady\\" really could be it, but as it stands, many listeners will feel overwhelmed by the album's end.<br /><br />I don't know how many chances a quasi-known pop entity gets to break big before the listening public give up on 'em, but here's hoping that Janelle gives a full commitment to winning over a larger audience before her time is up. In the meantime, \\"Electric Lady\\" offers 10 or so moments of pop magnificence, so at least we have something to enjoy until the next one. 3.5 Stars.ength.

B000ICZD4I|5.0|I have  always loved Fried Green Tomatoes. This is my second copy of the movie! Looking forward to it again!
B000ZJTPLG|5.0|The guitar sounds great with the headphones I currently have but I'm looking to get some better phones for this and then it would be even better.
