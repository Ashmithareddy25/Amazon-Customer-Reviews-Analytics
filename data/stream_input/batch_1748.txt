B0018QQQK8|5.0|Great book!  This was an excellent read.  I read it before the movie, just to make sure I did not miss anything.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I fell in love with the Piano Guys music when I stumbled over their Cello Wars on youtube. I found out that they have produced one amazing and original piece of music after the other, so that buying their album was out of the question, even if I had to order from overseas (Germany). There are so many other reviews here that I can actually not add much more additional helpful info - other than to tell you that they have just published a Lord of the Rings medley which is not on this album. Awesome video this time again also!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The book was well written. All of the issues that were raised when the book first came out about security issues are not warranted.  The book told the story without having to be sensationalized and it showed the hard work and dedication these service members have to the USA.<br />Having served in the military, USAF, I know what it is like to serve your country and to know that what all servicemen ans servicewomen do to ensure our freedom. This is one proud American that is thankful for all that Mark Owen and his Seal Team did.

B005HSL626|3.0|Fruit ninja is a great game but can be a little glitchy at times. If this happens it's helpful just to go to your home page and go back to the game again a few seconds later. If you're looking for a higher quality game of Fruit Ninga you're better off buying the paid version. Have fun playing Fruit Ninga! Hope this is helpful!
B009P5S11G|5.0|I love the music on this album. It's amazing that Rihanna consistently produces superior quality music and she does it at a breakneck pace.  As the great artists of the past used to do (The Beatles, Frank Sinatra, James Brown, Prince to name a few), Rihanna creates and releases music at a rapid pace. Her love of her craft is evident in her music. Having already released the modern day classics, Umbrella, We Found Love and Love The Way You Lie, with this album, Rihanna can add Diamonds to that list. Keep pushing and growing! Your artistry is much appreciated.
630471193X|5.0|Great Picture!  Great Plot and story line!  Good actor and actress!  This is more of a family / drama movie than a science fiction.  It is very dramatic and very interesting.  I was very happy to find it.  Wonderful movie.
B001M5RR4Y|5.0|Its a movie that starts out a bit strange, but it grows, and the music that supports it is truly beautiful.  Loved it!

B009MF56GC|2.0|\\"The Expendables 2\\" is only more of what you received with the first blockbuster film. It's definitely bigger with the introduction of new cast members such as Liam Hemsworth, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Scott Adkins, and Chuck Norris and bigger roles for Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis, but is it better? How can a sequel and its predecessor bring together so many action stars and yet still leave so much to be desired? Somehow \\"The Expendables 2\\" tops the first movie in the sense that it leaves you with a craving for something a lot more satisfying.<br /><br />\\"The Expendables 2\\" was originally built around the death of Tool (Mickey Rourke) and Barney and his team getting revenge because of it. Well when Rourke suddenly pulled out for another project, that load was dumped onto Billy the Kid (Liam Hemsworth). The problem is you only get to know the character for approximately ten minutes before they pull the trigger. While Billy does manage to squeeze in a story about Afghanistan, another one about getting back to his girlfriend in France, and seems to have a father-son relationship with Barney, there isn't much of an impact since his character feels like the last minute replacement that it is.<br /><br />The writing isn't any better this time around. Sylvester Stallone is more than likely to blame as he should probably stick to acting and directing rather than chipping in with the screenplay. These guys say the most trivial and clich&eacute; one-liners you could possibly think of. \\"See you later, alligator,\\" and \\"Looks like somebody had a bad day,\\" are just a few examples. The motivations of several characters are really blurred, as well. Chuck Norris enters the picture as Booker, a sniper who claims that he only works alone and is a \\"lone wolf.\\" Then later shows up to help out Barney and his group again solely because, \\"Oh. Well, sometimes it's more fun to run with the pack.\\" The Church (Bruce Willis) character is the worst offender. He and Barney obviously have a history together, but in the first half of the movie he's rather villainous. He throws Barney and his team right into harm's way because Barney owes Church $5 million. Church threatens Barney and basically blackmails him into this mission. But then at the end of the movie, he helps Barney and they're good buddies by the final scene.<br /><br />Speaking of Church, his back and forth with Trench (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is also near unbearable. Schwarzenegger already made light of his \\"I'm back!\\" catchphrase in \\"Terminator 3,\\" so hearing him do it over and over again here is like beating a dead horse. Then Bruce Willis decides to say it and Arnold replies with, \\"Yippee ki yay,\\" before throwing in a \\"Rambo\\" reference a moment later. It just feels so elementary.<br /><br />Donnie Yen was originally offered a role in this film, but turned it down. So obviously Jet Li is going to pick up the slack, right? Nope, he bows out of the film after the first ten minutes. He does manage to throw in a pretty entertaining action sequence with frying pans before he leaves though. Scott Adkins is a martial arts actor who's finally managing to pick up steam. He's more than capable of putting on a good show, but doesn't get a chance to here. You also want to see more of Van Damme, but he's dealt with rather suddenly after only delivering two of his patented jumping roundhouse kicks. Speaking of Van Damme, his character's name is Vilain. How much thought was put into that?<br /><br />There are very few positives with \\"The Expendables 2.\\" Jason Statham has a few entertaining action sequences, but you're left wondering why one of those scenes couldn't have gone to somebody else. Dolph Lundgren's Gunnar character takes facts from his actual background like having a master's degree in engineering and even gets a bit more screen time. Aside from the opening sequence, which outdoes every explosive sequence in the first movie, explosions aren't as frequent this time around. Most of the actionlies within people's heads being blown off or fistfights that never seem to last as long as you want them to.<br /><br />\\"The Expendables 2\\" is only \\"bigger and better\\" in the sense that there are bigger additions to the cast, meatier roles for returning actors, and the amount of bullet casings collected when it's all said and done. But the downside is \\"The Expendables 2\\" is almost more of a letdown than the original movie. The dialogue is worse, character motivations are blurred, and the storyline is beyond simple. It's really only a great movie at face value because when you take a step back and realize how bad it is, you'll be left asking yourself how you gather this many well known stars in two movies and still manage to screw it up twice.<br /><br />In one of the special features, Sylvester Stallone talks about things being more grounded in \\"The Expendables 2.\\" He says that the first film was kind of all over the place in terms of character development and it was left up in the air on whether everyone was trying to be serious or slightly lighthearted at times. Stallone mentions that having that many big stars in one picture got to him the first time around and that it's better-rounded in the sequel. Maybe it is, but it still feels like Stallone is blinded by the dense fog that is made up of all these stars coming together. Everyone is just goofy as hell all the time and Barney and Christmas act like an old married couple. There's a difference in tapping into that same cheesiness that made up nearly every strand of DNA in action films of the 80s and 90s and overdoing it. \\"The Expendables 2\\" gets way too carried away with that aspect and dives into overkill territory more often than not.<br /><br />Special features on the Blu-ray edition of the film include Audio Commentary with director Simon West, the 21-minute \\"Gods of War: Assembling Earth's Mightiest Anti-Heroes,\\" the 25-minute \\"Big Guns, Bigger Heroes: The 1980s and the Rise of the Action Film,\\" the 14-minute \\"On the Assault: The Real-Life Weaponry of The Expendables 2,\\" the 24-minute \\"Guns For Hire: The Real Expendables,\\" four and a half minutes of deleted scenes, and a five-minute gag reel.ithin people's heads being blown off or fistfights that never seem to last as long as you want them to.<br /><br />\\"The Expendables 2\\" is only \\"bigger and better\\" in the sense that there are bigger additions to the cast, meatier roles for returning actors, and the amount of bullet casings collected when it's all said and done.

B005LAIIHG|5.0|Ang Lee is a director that most individuals don't seem to be too fond of. To this day, his \\"Hulk\\" film remains unwatched because so many people have offered their opinion that it's awful. \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\" is in the same category, but for different reasons. Wuxia films are almost always better when the wire work is more subtle and \\"Crouching Tiger\\" looks to take no shame in everyone flying around at all times. \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" was the only Lee film to be experienced before \\"Life of Pi\\" and that was solely because seeking out Heath Ledger's work seemed like a pretty vital thing to do after \\"The Dark Knight.\\" Going into \\"Life of Pi,\\" there was literally no interest. The book hadn't been read beforehand and trailers had not been seen. Expectations were mostly, \\"It may be gorgeous to look at, but will lack any sort of depth.\\" One of the best feelings in the world is having your misconceptions about something be completely wrong and work out in ways you never imagined.<br /><br />\\"Life of Pi\\" is narrated by an older Pi (Irrfan Khan) and takes place in the present as he tells his life story to a writer (Rafe Spall). Pi begins with how he got his name and how his family owned a zoo, but eventually leads into his family needing to leave India for financial purposes. The heart of the story lies in Pi as a young man (played by Suraj Sharma) and the time he spent out at sea on a lifeboat with a tiger named Richard Parker, but getting to that point is quite an ordeal. Pi loses everything and everyone close to him in the blink of an eye and he doesn't count on making what feels like an unbreakable bond with a Bengal tiger.<br /><br />The story is first introduced to the writer by a friend of the family called Mamaji and tells the writer that Pi's story will \\"make him believe in God.\\" Mamaji is a champion swimmer and there's at least one really spectacular sequence at the beginning of the film where you see Mamaji swimming. The film is shot beautifully and makes full use of eye catching perspectives including overhead shots of the ocean. Pi begins on the lifeboat with a zebra, a hyena, and an orangutan, but the animals are an intricate part of the story. It's not entirely seamless as you can tell when real animals are being used and when CG enters the picture, but the transition from one to the other is relatively flawless.<br /><br />The adventure film offers a rather marvelous message about religion as Pi discusses the experimentation with several different religions as a young boy. Even though it seems kind of silly that a boy has adopted so many religions at one point in his life, it portrays a religious message in a light that doesn't seem too preachy which is very welcome and unusual for a message of this caliber. But the religious aspect is really only a backdrop for being on your own path to finding who you really are. Feeling so alone for so long and having Pi talk about not being alone and not getting to say goodbye to those he cared about most is one of those things that just hits you really hard.<br /><br />While witnessing Pi attempt to tame Richard Parker is really entertaining, there are so many unbelievable sights to witness in \\"Life of Pi.\\" There's the whale, the jellyfish, the flying fish, that disastrous storm, and that seaweed island with all of the meerkats. \\"Life of Pi\\" never really lets up on being visually astounding from beginning to end. A personal favorite is when Pi starts seeing visions in the ocean and what he questions as being a daydream or a night dream.<br /><br />\\"Life of Pi\\" is pleasantly satisfying. With a heartfelt message, beautiful visuals, and stunning camera work, \\"Life of Pi\\" is truly a sight to behold and illustrates how essential 3D can be to a film that isn't a summer blockbuster.s full use of eye catching perspectives including overhead shots of the ocean.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|This book is too good. It makes me suspicious how good it is. How can this good of a book be self published? I was suspicious of all the 5 star reviews when I first looked at the page too. Those must be all his facebook friends or he must have paid those people off, I thought. Then I read it and I cannot believe this talented author wasn't picked up by some first rate publisher. I've only liked one other author this much and I don't compare anyone to these books I hold sacred to fantasy, but I really felt as deeply in love with this book as I did with The Blade Itself series by Joe Abercrombie. The pacing, the strong characters and intertwining of destinies is really compelling. I'm so happy Mr.Ryan is going to keep writing this series, it's really the best I've read in years.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Such a simple idea but a great fun game to play with friends and family.  Still a novice but learning  and loving it!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|When I was about to buy this book I didn't really know why I wanted to buy it. I don't read a lot of current fiction (where the setting is the current year) and I was asking myself how am I going to relate to a young cancer patient or find this interesting? I bought it and discovered that Mr.Green guided me on how to relate to a young cancer patient and let me discover how his characters' stories were interesting. I don't think I've been more surprised by a book in my life. I can remember almost all of it, the jokes, the heartbreaking moments, the not-so-good/boring parts, even weeks after finishing. It really says a lot about an author when you can pick out the parts you didn't even like and notice they have a purpose in the story and it shows a different side to the book. Every part of this book is memorable and an experience unto itself.
B004DK49DW|1.0|It seems that Social Distortion, one of my all time favorite bands, has a new and exciting direction on every new record, while retaining their overall punk-blues-country rock sound. Now this record is different as nearly every other Social D song has a decidedly punk rock undertone. This album is slower, softer and lacks the attitude that all other output by this band has. It seems that Social D has lost its sense of rebellion that the band once had in spades. Mike Ness and co. claim to have given this album an \\"urban snottiness\\" saying that this is \\"a little more Johnny Thunders\\" than previous efforts. NOT SO! This music sounds very similar to what the original punk rockers were rebelling against; that 70's and 80's top 40 or modern rock crap!<br /><br />Granted Social Distortion has grown and it isn't the early 1980's anymore. I'm not expecting the band to sound like TSOL, but White Light White Heat White Trash Part 2 would have been nice. Their other albums were mostly a healthy progression from the hardcore punk of the 1980's into the punk-tinged roots music that they are now known for.<br /><br />This album is a sign that most open minded punk rockers are probably done with Social Distortion, though the kids who got introduced to them in the 90's might appreciate it. It simply lacks the power that Social D once had.<br /><br />If you like Social Distortion there are better records out there. Try Mommy's Little Monster, Prison Bound, White Light, White Heat, White Trash or Mainliner: Wreckage From the Past.

B002SSUQFG|4.0|This watch is not for those who want to make a bold statement. The case is not oversized, but it is a reliable, rugged-looking watch that does not use batteries!!! Some with large wrists may find it too small, but I have smaller than average wrists and it fits me well. The only negative is that the straps contain two metal links to secure the extra straps. I am a student and use a laptop every single day and worry that these metal parts will scratch my laptop. I'll be buying a replacement strap soon. Oh yea...the price on here fluctuates, so buy it when it is at the lower end. I did not know and paid the extra $$$. Even so, I still consider it a good deal.

B001BKVWYG|5.0|...Howcome Rodriguez' voice didn't reach me before? But I am so happy that the documentary \\"Searching for Sugar Man\\" in 2012 let me to him, making me not only buy the albums but also travel to London to see him live: \\"I was born for the purpose that crucifies your mind\\" he sings, and the raw political and philosophical lyrics keep playing with my mind, showing me glimpses of a rich inner universe of a highly engaged, feeling and thinking man. This is art. And that - is a cold fact.
0385535147|4.0|I don't think there is a John Grisham book that I didn't like!  This one is no exception and Grisham once again with his law background gives us an insight into the justice system and more specifically the prison side.  Malcolm Bannister is a small town lawyer who is sent to a minimum security facility--they don't call them prisons for a crime that he didn't commit and that becomes clearer as the story unfolds.  He is bitter because he has lost his wife, son, and career as he of course has been disbarred.  He finds a way out of his remaining sentence by his knowledge of who really killed a judge and his secretary and makes a deal with the FBI and justice department.  The plot is a convoluted one and it really isn't clear until almost the end what is really going on and it's cleverly done.  I'm always amazed at John Grisham's ability as a story teller and his imagination as well as legal expertise as he develops these various takes on the legal system.  This like all his books are hard to put down once you start reading!

And that is exatly what I do listening to this album loving it from word to track and back. Over and over again. His soulful and intelligent songs are easy and mysteriously deep at the same time. Like the magnificent song &#34;Cause&#34; with great poetic lines like &#34;while the rain drank champagne&#34;, &#34;my heart's become a crooked hotel full of rumours&#34; and &#34;how many times can you wake up in this comic book and plant flowers&#34;. His words and music sure are planting flowers in my mind.

B000RZIGVS|1.0|I was so psyched when I ordered this set!  I've been a fan of TNG since its inception and was excited to finally own the series!<br />When I received this collection, my excitement immediately turned sour.<br />My rating is based on the quality of the packaging, not on the content, so please understand.  I love the show; but I expected a much more professional and quality presentation.<br />The packaging was awful.  The disks are loaded into flimsy CD trays (the kind that break easily) -2 to a tray - and the trays are bound together in 3 clumps of 8 or 9 trays each, with plastic packaging tape on the side to hold the clumps together.  Once the tape gives way, you're going to have a mess on your hands, with lots of individual trays.  There is no separation between seasons either, so unless you're extremely careful and replace each disk in exactly the same and correct tray, after a while of watching through the disks, you're going to have a puzzle to sort through.  There are also no inserts detailing which episodes are on each disk, so you have to flip through 49 disks to find the episode you want to watch.<br />Also, the cardboard insert with my set promised a \\"20th anniversary collectible poster\\", and a \\"reproduction of the USS Enterprise D Dedication Plate\\" - NEITHER of which were included.<br />I have not watched all 49 disks, but what I have seen so far, the picture quality is good, even if the sound sometimes doesn't sync up.  The disks themselves look good, with no visible scratches or abrasions.<br />And of course the content is fantastic!  It's Star Trek TNG...how can it not be?<br />If you're a fan of TNG - AVOID this set!  Paramount got greedy by charging between $200 and $300 (I paid $212 for a new, incomplete package), and you WILL NOT get your money's worth.

0525953728|5.0|As the full title reveals this is a firsthand account of a Navy SEAL who witnessed the death of Osama Bin Laden. It is also an autobiography of his life and career up to that point.<br /><br />Mr. Owen does not sugar-coat the truth nor does he leave out the language that often accompanies that of a military member. If you are expecting a book that tells more than what is already publicly known... forget about it.<br /><br />I think the book is really well written. In particular, the Prologue is just a taste of the action before the reader sees what lead up to the infamous day. Mr. Owen intersperses personal thoughts among the action in just the right amount. Perhaps Kevin Maurer helped him with this. Either way, I was never bored with the book at all. I learned a lot about the Navy SEAL lifestyle and it made me appreciate them even more than I already did. I applaud Mr. Owen for putting what he knew to be the truth out there for everyone to see.<br /><br />I feel this book will be good for anyone who is military-minded or would like to learn more about life of a Navy SEAL beyond what is projected in movies and fiction books. I hope some young man or woman will read his book and decide that they too wish to defend and serve the United States of America with high standards and abilities.
0425263916|5.0|Great book cant wait till the next one comes out . great series. can't put the book down once you start reading them
B007YLEMDE|4.0|it has some great songs, but it is not what I had anticipated.  I guess I should have read the label on the songs a little better.  I wanted more Stevie!
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|I love Christina and this album is brilliant. BRILLIANT. I have been listening to it nonstop since I got it.
B002IE2JF0|4.0|I went into this film not knowing the plot, thinking it was another sci-fi movie with a generic plot but I found it to keep my attention the entire time, it's one of the better sci-fi movies I have seen in a while.  James Caviezel plays the lead part well and the filming locations are very convincing of the period.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I like how it starts out softly and then builds in volume if I have yet to shut it off.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Suzanne Collins second install had twist and turns but at the end of the book it was inevitable. Katniss protecting petta, district thirteen it was all inevitable and predictable.
B001H1SW4M|5.0|This is the first horror movie I have seen where you can root for the victims but still appreciate the ingenuity of the killing methods.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|We are enjoying this amazing series. Sherlock is cast perfectly with Jonny Lee Miller. The choice for a Doctor Watson was a surprise in many ways but Lucy Lui has been quite interesting in this role and has proven to us that she is the perfect choice for Watson as well.<br />we look forward to every show and it is a &#34;do not miss&#34; for us.
B00ABD0SW6|1.0|I'm paying for my content. I don't care if its one ad, its too much. FX is close to making me cancel my season pass and find other revenues to watch. Be careful FX, I can't be alone.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|My granddaughter is such a princess, she just loves anything Disney<br />and princesses, of which she is mine!<br />This little girl will be so happy.<br />But I haven't rec. the Cinderella movie or the brave movie she wants so badly.<br />Hope it come soon!
B007SGLZP8|1.0|Cardboard characters and a wildly unrealistic and cartoonish plot with no effort by the author, or his conglomerate, to portray the Federal Judicial system as it actually exists. Because Grisham, a lawyer, penned a couple of decent legal thrillers in his first two efforts, I was suckered into reading this ridiculous novel. Although I am ashamed to say that I did finish it, It was with a sense that surely there is a point to this mess. There isn't.<br />I enjoyed his first two efforts, but never again!
B002WJI66C|5.0|My grandson loves Mario games and the ghost cracks him up!<br />He's gonna be so thrilled, I may get a bigger hug and kisses!
B004HW7JHE|4.0|I was taken back to an an era of my youth, when stay at home moms were the norm. Women in the working force were given level of jobs in offices where men dominated. I cheered the strongly talented women, who overcame the male dominance and began to soar. This era was spot on with the clothing and chsnges of the time of women in the working place. Lots of sex and alcohol along with incessant cigarette smoking.<br />I understand why men died at earlier ages than at<br /> the present time. Terrific acting of all of the cast members. A four star show indeed.I waited patiently for the release of SeaSON Five after enjoying the first Four AT AMAZON.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|This was excelent and I can't wait for the next series to come out.<br />The actors are all seasoned veterans and execute their roles wonderfully.
B00633W614|5.0|I love all the twist and turns of this novel. There is nothing normal about the turn of events so the reader always wants to turn the page. I wished the world would go away so i could read for hours uninterrupted.
1451627297|5.0|I am almost thru the book and it is fasinating.<br />I do hope someone make a movie based from this.
B0083P1QUM|1.0|I felt like Ms. Cornwell was just going through the motions of writing this book. It seemed boring to me. Maybe Kay should be retired now.
034580404X|5.0|I read the three books in less than 2 weeks!<br />These books are red hot! I almost wore my ove gloves to read them!<br />Teriffic!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the games on this app are run and entertaining. even my grandmother enjoyed playing them. I loved it. I play them a lot.
B009A9BF5G|1.0|I was there (in Paris, Stade de France with my Mimine (french fancy name given to my girlfriend)).<br /><br />Nothing in this Blu-ray falls short of the amazing concert we attended to. I wonder what a guy like Steven Spielberg would have done with the filmed material. The image just doesn't capture the emotion of that early night of September. The editing is so jerky it must have been done by a teenager and the sound is muffled.<br /><br />This is un insult to this amazingly creative band!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|i like the game and think it is fun but it is to simple and repetitive. I would recommend for younger ages
B0085A9J18|5.0|What an awesome movie! Even if you're not a fan of subtitles, then no need to worry, for the action and (simple-enough) story definitely makes up for it
1451648537|5.0|The book was delivered as scheduled and I read it in a week. Public make people out to be some kind of genius for their achievements but they are all flawed. And what is with the attitude against charity?
B008DW6VOQ|5.0|I use it all of the time when I am on the road and need a quick check of where the market is.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really love the game, but hope that it gets an update.  I've been playing it on my Google Nexus 7, but it won't launch since the Jelly Bean 4.2 update.  :-(
B008TRUDAS|4.0|I give Slammed 4 stars....the only reason I didn't give it five is because I thought the book could have been longer. But the story was incredible and touching. I enjoyed the second book even more, Point of Retreat. Slammed is a MUST READ for any woman who enjoys a good love story without all the graphic sex scenes.
B0097BY3K6|5.0|Most Amazing Violinist and album on the planet.  This man knows his blessed violin and you can tell by each note that is played.
B005723JSQ|5.0|Sophie Kinsella is hilarious! I think a lot of women can relate to the main character, which is why I give it 5 stars and highly recommend this novel. If you're in the mood for a charming romantic comedy, this is the perfect choice.
B007PJFIU6|5.0|This whole series of games is exceptional.  The interpretation of the art on the cards by members of my family and friends has been insightful and delightful.  This is also a great game for the classroom.
0743297334|5.0|Hemingway is an all time great author; anything he wrote is superb. I would recommend it to anyone, especially students of history.
B001L5U15M|2.0|I'm sad to say this bag was a disappointment. It clearly states two DSLRs would fit in this bag. I was not able to safely store a Nikon D3S and D4. In addition, when loaded with single camera and extra lens and flash, the bag is too unbalanced.
B003B0D2QU|4.0|Excellent. Autobiographical book by the President. It sheds light on much of what he has done. I'd think so even if I were not a Democrat.
B00785P2QC|4.0|great developmental gameplay. I only wish they didn't make it hard to advance without spending actual money. Other than that it is a great game.
B00846TTDG|3.0|Even though this film engaged you like a high quality action film, you can't escape the feeling that it's a glorified armed forces commercial, and that' probably because the actors are portraying roles they do professionally. There is simply too many hints of military marketing, but man is it cool to see how these guys operate. Worth renting, but without your (female) significant other.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is great! i love minecraft on pc and xbox and this is just as good in the go! (except for not having certain things) all this game needs is the nether and buckets and it would be perfect! except for one thing. my friend (name not going to be added) has been lagging out and getting randomly hurt when he does absoluteley nothing to get hurt. plz fuix and add these things. thanks!
B001HN6922|5.0|We ordered this for my son and it came very quickly and works great. He loves the movie and wants to watch it every day.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is by far my favorite TV show of all time. I am looking forward to purchasing the entire series.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|It was a great story of love and betrayal in a difficult time, and well blended with the past and present. Loved it
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I enjoyed this book. I was afraid it would be overtly political and was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't that bad. I great insight into the lives of our professional soldiers.
B0091REZMW|4.0|it's a pretty good game. I like the graphics. it just takes a while to complete tasks. otherwise it's pretty good.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Well written with a lot interesting developments during the story. The different story lines are kept nicely chronological and blend together without any problems. Will definetely continue reading the complete series.
B00608HMFW|5.0|I caught some of the episodes in the morning when getting ready for work on TNT.  I was curious to see how it all began.  I have not stopped and and up to season 7!  Really well written and exciting.  Great purchase.
B0000DZEE3|5.0|I saw this  concert on youtube and i liked it so much that  i had to have it, i strongly recommed it to all the fans of the red hot chili peppers, also, the price was a big factor, a lot of great music for a low price!
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|Right up there with Warehouse 13 and Sanctuary--all the Best in my book!  Does remind me of Friday the 13th--the Series with Louise Robey, Chris Wiggins, John D. LeMay.  Looking forward to the next Season.
B0011Z78R6|5.0|Good to hear it after 10 year or so. vary good sounding  The Eagles at there bast . . .
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I chose this book because I kept hearing how great it was (and the movie). I honestly did not expect it to be this great! I couldn't put it down! It was an easy enough read that I could focus on the story instead of the words, but I didn't feel like I was reading a children's book. The were lots of twists and turns. I can't wait to read the next two! (And then watch the movies.)
B007SGLZP8|1.0|The book was ridiculous...over the top unbelievable and Grisham's epilogue was a slap in the face to loyal fans everywhere. If he no longer wants to write he should just say a gracious thank you and good bye to all the fans who have enjoyed his amazing books over the years. How sad.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|this is great app that work as advertised. very powerfully app that gives you great info about your system.  load it on all your androids.
1401322786|2.0|The Time Keeper by Mitch Albom is one of those inspirational books that explicitly states its main idea within the first few pages--and then restates it again and again and again.  By the time you reach the middle of the book, you feel like shouting, \\"I get it!  Time is precious and we must appreciate it!\\"  It's not that this is a bad idea, but it would have been more interesting to have to discover it through the story instead of being constantly reminded of it.<br /><br /> I was dismayed by the anti-science slant in this novel.  The time keeper is Dor, a man from ancient times who is being punished for having discovered how to measure time.  That's right, his \\"sin\\" involved acting on his curiosity about time by studying it until he was able to understand it better; in the process, he was able to find ways to measure it.  When asked why he has done such a thing, he shamefully answers, \\"To know\\".  Knowledge is never bad!  What you do with your knowledge might be bad (and certainly some of the characters were not using their time well), but the knowledge is not to blame!<br /><br /> The book is full of errors in logic which I found irritating, the most important of which is the central idea of the novel:  the measurement of time leads to people trying to pack more activities into their lives (Why would that be?), which leads to people failing to appreciate their relationships, etc. , etc.  Oh, and electronics are bad.  We look at screens too much.  And eventually, we won't have feelings at all!  All of this is supposed to follow seamlessly, and is never questioned.<br /><br /> The novel does have some good points.  I found the character of Sarah realistic, and her difficulties were moving.  Perhaps being a former high school nerd myself helped me to understand the ways she fooled herself into believing track-star Ethan genuinely cared for her; her heartbreak when she found out differently was totally believable.  I found her story interesting, much more so than thoseof the other two main characters.<br /><br /> If you would like to read a feel-good novel which doesn't require you to do any deep thinking on your own, read The Time Keeper.  Or save yourself the trouble and read this a few times:  Don't worry about what time it is!  Use your time well!  There, you've got it!
B00A77II0U|5.0|loved this game. great graphics with just enough hints to get you through. story is great too. if you love hidden object games this one is the best i have played so far. awesome!!!!!
1408215330|5.0|The only thing i can say to describe it: AMAZING. It came really quickly and in really good shape although it was in India and the dictionary is really complete. It came with a CD but i haven't used it yet
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Its a book you just can't put down!!!!! I can't wait to read the next 2 books of the series!!!!
B009E2U7L2|5.0|Cher is one of the best new artist I've heard in a long time and I know this album is just her beginning.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Just sit back and enjoy.  Good thing this is not an 8 track as i would have worn it out already. Yes, I do have a 8 track deck.  Very pleased and brings back so many memories.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this solitaire game. I have tried several other solitaire games and this one is the best. Thank you.
0307730697|5.0|I am a retired Navy Command Master Chief who has read a lot of books in my 63 years of life.  I won't add to the great reviews already written about this book other than saying this is the most inspiring book I have ever read, bar none.  I gave it 5 stars because they don't offer 10.  Make sure you have a box of Kleenex by you as you approach the book's ending.  A MUST READ!<br /><br />Art Taylor<br />HMCM(SW), USN/Ret<br />Command Master Chief
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I've been a long time fan of Nelson DeMille having read all of his books.  John and Kate Corey are out there again doing their thing.  John's acerbic humor is keeps me in stitches page after pager.  I look forward to yet another adventure ASAP
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Absolutely one of the funniest sitcoms of all time!! I have every season and I can watch it over and over again!!
B00564GPKY|5.0|Duhigg' s book is worth reading - and re-reading when you realize that you have habits that you would like to get rid of and still have.  He is a good story teller - some of the examples are perhaps overdrawn - but the lessons contained are worthwhile and as a manual for reinforcing good habits and dealing with less desirable ones, it's helpful.
141694737X|4.0|It's a good book but I really wish there were more poppy colors and that the images of the animals and the flaps were bigger.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|Just not as good of a book as the first.  He seems to pay little attention to the history, and perhaps too much time on his characters.  I expected more drama re the history of WWII, as he did in the first book.  It's just not as good a read.  That's what it comes down to.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|I am reading this book with my husband. Loving It so far :)  This book is a great one to just relax and read.
B007TML4EI|1.0|The game itself is alright.  It's fun to play with during long trips.<br /><br />I was able to move this app to my external SD card, however the app stores data on my smartphone's internal memory despite being installed in SD.<br /><br />It consumed many megabytes of internal memory.  I could no longer install other apps.<br /><br />I had to clear the app data and then uninstall the app to clear it up.
B0086700CM|5.0|I think this is a great app for the kindle fire its so much fun to play and so addicting I recommend this to anyone. love it
B00005JLEX|5.0|great series and wonderful cast. order was sent fast and quality is good. will be ordering more stuff soon. satisfied
B008133DO8|5.0|The modern contemporary Sherlock Holmes is a must-watch. The series is fact-paced, fun and extremely witty. I have watched both season several times now and its extraordinary every time.
B006R4H5FG|4.0|If you are preparing for an important speech and want to learn new techniques to perform better this book is a great resource. After reading this book you will learn how to start your speech and how to deliver it. This book is practical and has great content. After reading this book I can recommend [[ASIN:B009Y8S6OG Magic of Public Speaking: A Complete System to Become a World Class Speaker]] which is also an amazing book to read and gives a bit different perspective on public speaking.
B008O69SZ0|5.0|The guy is seventy three and he still rocks like a teenager,this is by far his best album in a long time,great songwriting,great band
B005HSL626|5.0|this game is the best game ever when u finissh all of the levels buy puss and boots fruit ninja
B0086449YA|2.0|First of all I love Mark Knopler and I understand that he is doing exactly what he wants to do.This album has wry few high points,the song writing at best is very average,it probably would have been better had it been a single album.Very disappointing
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Good app for general small notes. I have not used it for larger projects. Free is a good price too.
B0096PAA6E|4.0|Gary's sound is still coming round. But, he is definitely headed down the right road. His emotion sounds through and I look forward to the next CD.
B007EECSFA|1.0|Too many pages for a story finally told in the last chapter.  Big disappointment after reading Mouton's great other books.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Easy and quick read.  Couldn't put it down.  The development of the story line and characters draws you in. Intense at times.
B0016PM722|5.0|This was bought as a gift and after it arrived I wanted one myself!  The detail and quality is amazing and it just plain looks great.  If you are a Star Wars fan you will love this lightsaber.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest!  I am a crafter and a gardener.  There are so many ideas on this site.  I will be busy this winter repurposing things.
B0068FYZZW|5.0|a great drama with lots of comedic moments, john hughes best 'serious' film of the '80s! think I'll watch it again right now...
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I am very glad I installed this on my Kindle Fire.  I have used it many times and I am happy to have it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I actually really like this app for the kindle. Although you can already go and check the battery level in the settings, this lets you just open the status bar thing and see the battery level whenever you want instead of having to go through all of the settings. On top of that, it gives you a great estimation for just how long you can use your kindle for certain things before it dies, such as how long you have to use the Internet or read books. Its a very great app!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I know it is written pretty close to 50 Shades of Grey but I am a sucker for a great love story, no matter how messed up.  I like that she is not perfect, but messed up as well.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is one of my favortie puzzles. I like it very much although it can get very hard. good game
B0083GPDBO|2.0|A big buildup only to be abruptly cut off by the wuss of the movie. A test without the giver of the test coming back to grade us.
B004GJDQT8|3.0|For some inexplicable reason this app is next to impossible to install on a Nexus 7. I had to search through different online forums to find out how. You would need to get the Amazon App installer first and load it through there. Once installed it works well which makes me wonder why this is supposedly marked as &#34;incompatible&#34; with the Nexus 7 in the first place.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|Great to see Michelle Pfeiffer in this movie. Good story and I liked the ending. Helena Bonam Carter was also great with her American accent.
B009JNXK88|3.0|Retro gamers should enjoy this simple but engaging videogame. Works well and does not lag at all on a Nexus 7.
B009329ZF2|3.0|This could've been longer but maybe they ran out of money. Rihanna was pretty good for being new to acting. You'd think that an advanced race would've been harder to beat than using an old battleship. Meh...
B007SGLZP8|3.0|You would think this is Grisham's first book.  It is not very imaginative or captivating.  But it is still a fun read.
B009HV2JT8|1.0|Long drawn out and boring. They don't even go into detail on the monsters power until they actually meet it and try to kill it.
B007V65R54|5.0|I have always enjoyed writers who put rational thought and science ahead of emotional arguments.  I have previously read &#34;Blink&#34;, &#34;Black Swan&#34;, and &#34;Tipping Point&#34; and this book is on the same shelf as the others.
B008Y1RTUG|1.0|Long, drawn-out and Boring!!! How the heck is Kristen Stewart the most beautiful one of all and Charlize Theron the ugly sorceress? True fantasy here, not.
B003VANOFY|5.0|It's way better than expected.<br />Pros:<br />  Almost perfect comfort, you almost don't feel it sittin on your head<br />  Awesome sound quality<br />  Battery lives pretty long<br />  Great software<br />Cons:<br />  The headset can crackle with heavy sound, this is solved by turning the pre-amplifier all the way down to -12 db in the  advanced equalizer with the software.<br /><br />Really worth its money!
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Totally took me by surprise and I should have figured it out from the beginning. I loved the movie. Great graphics and acting and story line. I'm buying the DVD!
B0064Z62R0|5.0|Loved the music during the movie so much just had to have a copy to do house work by, I recommend it...
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|The story was pretty good with great special effects and Robert Downey JR was unforgettable. He kept the movie going with his delivery of those lines. Very funny.
B005LAII08|1.0|Received the DVD set, opened it up and put in the Blue Ray DVD, and....  the Castle.  That's it.  Sleeping Beauty's castle from the park when they have the opening Walt Disney credits thing.  Water was flowing beneath, and the flag was moving on top, but that was it.  Couldn't stop it.  Couldn't pause it.  Couldn't move forward/back, skip, change view.  When pressing play button, 51 minutes appeared at the top for the length of the castle doing nothing.  Menu didn't work.  Root menu didn't work.  Don't get me wrong, was a beautiful picture of the castle.  But no way to see a movie.  Swapped out the Blu Ray Bonus disc.  Same thing.  Put in 3D disc.  Same thing.  Put in regular DVD, and there we have what is supposed to happen.  Haven't tried the digital disc yet.<br />Would have expected all the discs to work on this.  Hopefully a one off, and will revamp this rating if it gets fixed.
B009VB97EY|4.0|athough i enjoyed seeing channing tatum in any movie, i expected there to be more of a story to it.  it was great to see the male dancers perform, but i wished the script would be more involved in a good story to add to the dancing. the performers were great but the story was weak to hold your intrest for long. if channing tatum wasnt carrying the movie, it wouldnt have survived.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Started great, good page turner, as Grisham can do exciting plots and make you care about the protagonist.  Unfortunately, the ending came quickly, didn't seem to connect with the previous story, and left you hanging - suddenly. It was disconcerting and left me feeling disappointed and let down by the author.  Sort of like a mystery where the clues lead to to one conclusion, and the writer pulls the rug out from under you at the end.  Not his best.
B0000248L1|5.0|Tripped across songs from this album on Pandora and have been in love with every track from this album.  Thought I would be that guy who just listens to the deep cuts like 'Word Salad' and 'Alice In Hell' but every song that comes up is yet another breath of fresh air from the terrible radio stations.  A definite must have for fans of the 80s metal and thrash scene.
B008V59AFW|3.0|The first CD contains many of Gabriel's songs that I like.  The other 2 CDs were from live concerts and contains less notiable music.  It was worth buying for the 1 CD.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is the first game I got and it reminds me of Mario.I think you should give it five stars!
0143119680|5.0|Very interesting.many fascinated characters.  The story caught my interest with the first few pages.  Great for witch, vampire fans.  Shows them in a  whole new light.
B004HO6I4W|5.0|This movie is so perfect. We like the music, songs, the story. Very colorful. This is the favorite now. :)
B005K17RU0|1.0|In the past I gave this app 5 stars but now down to one.  Installed back in 2012 and worked GREAT until yesterday.   I originally got it as a free app and they are now charging .99 for it soe maybe that is why it stopped working.  I could be told in a more productive way. Bummer!!
B005K0HDGE|1.0|Ugh. Sometimes you just gotta say it. We have all been guilty at one time or another of placing great expectations on something only to wonder later how it could be such a letdown. I have been a King fan for years. I think the first full length novel I ever read was Christine (which is still great.) I have followed this author's brilliant career for as long as I can recall. There have been some books that i definitely thought were better than others, but this one is just dreadful. Part of what makes me love Stephen King books is the weird sense you get that he lives just outside the realm of normal and that perhaps in some twisted way, he knows things that we don't. His books, although mostly fiction, have always been thought provoking and at times, just plain frightening. This book is neither. well, maybe it was. It was thought provoking in the respect that it provoked me to think about anything and everything except the book I was trying to slug through. I feel I must add a warning label to this review. If you are one of those optimistic types who keeps telling yourself it will get better...this is not one of those cases. The beginning is awful, the middle is terrible and since I can't think of a stronger superlative that Amazon will allow me to have in this writing space...the end is a time to celebrate the fact that the self-mutilation is over. Oddly, the funnest part of this book \\"11/22/63\\" was writing the review on 11/22/12. Sad.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This was exactly what I was looking for. It exactly matched the cable I had that went bad. I was relieved that I could replace it so easily.
1582701709|5.0|This was a gift that was given to me from my mom, and<br />I must say that it was a good book. The author gives examples of how<br />to make the most of things and that was one of the topics that got to me.<br /><br />Even though you may be at the bottom of things. If you focus on being positive<br />things really do turn out to be better.<br /><br />Overall, I would definitely recommend this book!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|This is a great series and I never miss a episode. I will be buying season III for sure when it comes out!!!!
B0043KK4N6|4.0|Great CD, has an old style flair to it that I enjoy and I was surprised how good it was.
1407115596|5.0|A great story with a super, gender-neutral tone.  My 2 year olds love the dragons, the discussion of all of Zog's 'ouchies' and the way the doctors fly off into the blue.  Great illustrations, great prose and super delivery service by the sellers.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|First time listening to this artist and I enjoyed the majority of it. Her voice and lyrics were very good.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Initially, I thought everything I had heard about this book could not be true. I am a cynic and do not believe things easily. All I can say now is how wrong I was. I read this book in less than 24 hours--I simply could not put it down. It is thought provoking in ways similar to \\"1984\\" or \\"The Giver.\\"
B0087JTAKW|5.0|If we could only stop to appreciate the moment or moments, we would learn to love the time we have around us. This book not only made me cried, but think of life as a gift that will end one day but it would be worth living it.

0553386794|4.0|I ordered this book as part of the whole collection of 'a song of ice and fire' novels.<br /><br />As a lover of medieval literature and fantasy dramas I was really keen to read Martin's first novel after watching the HBO series 'Game of Thrones'.<br /><br />I was not disappointed! The details and descriptions in Martin's book are truly breathtaking, not only can you picture each character in detail but you can imagine their thoughts, feelings and reactions to every situation. The descriptions of the settings, buildings and scenery are so descriptive that you feel like you can actually smell the smells and feel the textures of the land.<br /><br />With so many story lines running simultaneously alongside one another the book could be seen as being overcrowded and confusing, but somehow Martin manages to give them all enough time to be understood and followed whilst seamlessly linking them together. In a book with no 'Main Character' Martin provides us with a vast selection of Heroes, Heroines and Villains that often toe the line of good and evil. You will find yourself questioning each character and wondering if the person you have trusted throughout the novel is in fact a good person. All the characters are flawed and no-one is truly good or bad, each have their own goal and their own motives which add to the depth of the story.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to everyone, and if like me you have watched the HBO Series, then I cannot stress enough that you read the book as well. It contains little details and characters that could not be included in the Show but make the story so much more than it is on TV.<br /><br />I am now racing to finish the whole set as the story has me completely gripped!
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|Although I really enjoyed the first book of the series I hated the last two but had to read them since I had already started the story.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Perhaps J.K. Rowling wanted to write a modern-day Dickens novel. It had a large cast of characters, some trying to maintain firm control, and others destitute and adrift. Unfortunately, what she wrote was the most tedious and boring sections of my small-town newspaper that I usually skip over.<br /><br />I had to struggle to read this book, and after finally reaching the conclusion, my reaction was, &#34;That's it? That's all there is?&#34; If she had at least provided an epilogue, set 5 or 10 years later, we would know how the characters' decisions finally played out. There were simply no conclusions or closure.<br /><br />A Casual Vacancy is especially disappointing considering how excellent Rowling can be. But this time, her writing didn't have the magical qualities of her earlier work.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|loved the book!  imagine the voices from the tv show Castle, very good!  you'll enjoy the heat! I will order more in this series
B00001SIES|5.0|I purchased this after The Resistance and Absolution, and i love this album! I would still recommend this album over absolution (even though muscle museum and apocalypse please sound extremely similar), but would recommend The Resistance over this album. Great album for Early Muse!
B009CPE424|5.0|I loved it. It was just as good as the first 2 and a very great movie to watch. A must see!
0446580848|1.0|The Panther was on my \\"Must Read\\" booklist many weeks before it became available. I put in on reserve at the library and patiently awaited my turn. I got the book and it literally held me hostage for two weeks because it took me that long to wade through the incessant smart ass comments disguised as a real story. Take the first 200 pages, read the last 95 and then wonder at the final 10, because the ending simply stopped. What an awful reading experience. I love Nelson DeMille. Whoever edited this book or allowed him to continue on his inane patter did him and his cadre of faithful readers an incredible disservice. It was a chore to read it; it was a disappointment. I will still look forward to a Nelson DeMille book, simply because I remember the wonder of Up Country, the intricacies of The Gold Coast and the pathos of The Gate House. Yes, I have read his books from the beginning. I can only hope his next book will not be as incredibly annoying as this one.
B009GESJH2|5.0|I liked the heavy and instense music Kid Rock made back in the day. However, I love the changees he has made in recent years.  Rebel Soul is a great example. The music is foot-tapping, dancing around to the beat kind of music. Interesting maturity for a talented artist who can play ever musical instrument in his band. I know because I saw it multiple times. Great change-over.

1423140605|5.0|The Mark of Athena is the 3rd book in the 'Heroes of Olympus' series, and it didn't disappoint. I found myself eager to flow through every twist, turn, trick, and terror that the book threw at me. I loved that The Mark of Athena breaks the monotony of other books, which all have the base storyline of \\"Problem, Solve Problem, Heroes walk off into sunset\\". I was frustrated by the last chapter, which I'll would put below if the Google Play Store would allow me. The last chapter is written from the standpoint of Leo, who is still frustrated with being named as the \\"seventh wheel\\" by a seriously fanatical, over-caffinated, over-stimulated, keyed up \\"chicken harpy\\" named Ella. I could see why. He just got called a seventh wheel by a chicken. Leo still plays an important role in the book, now comfortable and savvy with his mechanical skills and problem-solving abilities. You can also tell that Leo is seriously ADHD. Remember in \\"The Son of Neptune\\", if you've read it, when Leo was chosen to craft the Argo II? Well, combine a hyperactive ADHD child with all the materials he could need for a ship, and a love for mechanical upgrades, and you get a very unusual ship. Most captains would be happy to have a wheel, an intercom, etc...Not Leo. He's also installed on the ship a keyboard, monitor, aviation controls from a LearJet, a dub-step soundboard, and motion-reactive controls from a Nintendo Wii. He could turn the ship by pulling on the throttle, fire weapons by sampling an album, or raise sails by shaking his Wii controller really fast. Even by the standards that Leo set in \\"The Son of Neptune\\", Leo is SERIOUSLY ADHD. Leo has turned a normal Greek tireme into a fire-breathing (Gracias, Festus!), ballista-packing, monster-detecting marvel. The ship packs enchanted Celestial Bronze shields that have been made to repel monsters, integrated sonar and radar, and a genius masthead that can do everything from activate the intercom to navigate the ship automatically, and even find the nearest Duncan Donuts. You see that the other characters have also increased their power and refined their skills. Percy has become a master of the seas, Jason has his power in the Cloud...and can call it down whenever he likes. Piper has refined her charmspeak so much that she can persuade angry Roman legionaires and metal dogs to relax and not make her the world's largest Milkbone. You've also got the major presence of Terminus, a indigenous statue that packs power without any weapons. Terminus guards the borders of Rome, and almost has a seizure when Leo, Jason, Piper, Percy, Coach Hedge, and Hazel try to land a fully-armed Greek warship in the Roman boundarys.<br /><br />Over-all, The Mark of Athena is an enticing book that has a solid cliff-hanger clincher that will leave you longing for the 4th book, The House of Hades, which will be out Fall 2013. I found the best deal for The Mark of Athena on the Google Play Store. Since i will be getting a Nexus 7 ( [...] ) for Christmas, it seemed perfect sense.e nearest Duncan Donuts.

B000OPPSX0|2.0|Great performances spoiled?  Well, we'll never know, because the sound quality is so poor (it's marginally better in some sonatas than in others).  Grumiaux and Haskil are such superb and musicianly players that one has to give them the benefit of the doubt -- and we know of their quality from other recordings: Haskil's Mozart, Grumiax's Beethoven Concerto recordings.  But in the Kreutzer, for example, you just can't hear the clear articulation of the piano's notes.  The violin sound is a bit more to the fore, but it too seems \\"spread,\\" so there is clearly a problem in the engineering somewhere.  Put on Argerich and Kremer's Kreutzer, and you're hearing stuff you didn't know was there in the Grumiaux/Haskil recording. So I'm with Julian Cardona on this one -- and I'm not an audiophile either.
B005UA0FLE|5.0|This was perfect mix of traditional Christmas music but with a polished finish and some pretty upbeat arrangements.  Will be a family tradition now for the holidays!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Eventually most shows fall apart after a successful season or two, but The Walking Dead just gets better. While the series departs considerably from the graphic novels (thus offering us an alternative universe of an alternative universe), both formats offer excellence. The casting for this show is perfect - and the writing shows a devotion to character detail (in most cases) rarely seen on TV.

0316228532|1.0|Perhaps I should have done more research before picking up this book, but after 10 vulgar words in the first 15 pages, I decided this book is not for me. The F bomb and even the C word...really, really not for me.

I work in medicine and for some reason it sometimes feels great to safely let out an oh who gives a once in a while. It's bad, it's unethical, it's pure unadulterated trash and it is awesome. Thanks for making me chortle.
B009LHJYA0|4.0|I've been waiting for the next Ill nino album after Dead New World for some time now.  After a year or two I was happy to hear about their new release \\"Epidemia\\".  Upon my initial listening, I found it to be good...but their wasn't any one track that blew me away right off the bat.  In fact I must admit that I found tracks to sound slightly similar and found myself wondering if I was listening to the same really long song at times.  Well like every good fan, I took the time to give the album the ever important second and third listening.  This is when I found the feel and style, and also noticed I was singing along with a couple of songs.  Bottom line this is a good album, it just doesn't have the WOW factor like previous albums Enigma and Dead New World.  Perhaps I have just been spoiled by the band's awesome collection of music, but nevertheless a definite buy for Ill Nino fans.<br /><br />The Best Tracks in my opinion:<br /><br />1. The Depression (Descent opening track)<br />2. Only the Unloved (One of the best tracks, should've been a single)<br />4. Eva (The most distinct sounding track on the album, this one rocks)<br />6. Death wants more (Best all around song on the album, should've been the first single)<br />8. Time won't save you (Reminiscent of style from Confessions, good song)<br />9. Father forgive me (Nice track, radio friendly)<br /><br />Worst Track in my opinion:<br />10. Invisible people (It feels like I've heard this one before, gives the impression of album filler)

B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I grew up with the author and enjoyed his writings about the Grand Coulee Dams and Eastern Washington and was quick to read this when I saw it's release.  There are many books written and many movies made regarding the inhumane treatment of groups of people such as the holocost in Nazi Germany, genocide in Rwanda, and brutal conflicts and conquests throughout written history.  Reading this book about this mans recent experience and life, and realizing all you have to do is look west over the Pacific to North Korea or look at a Google Sattelite map of North Korea and you can see the camps and know that this treatment is happening to human beings, RIGHT NOW, to people like him and how wrong it is and how little anything is being done to stop it because of the political and militarial difficulties.  In modern society we congratulate ourselves for technological achievements and accomplishments both as individuals and as a society but the modern world allowing something like this continue is an embarresment and shameful to any free person living in a free society.

There are a lot of other authors available who's publishers are not so greedy.  (Try David Baldacci or Michael Connelly)<br /><br />Until the price comes down John Grisham is not on my reading list and in 12 months when it does I probably will not be interested.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|OK. So like many of you, I have been reading these reviews and honestly getting quite scared about this set. Why? Well, I bought two of these sets plus some single albums. I was going to listen to the single albums  and put the sets on the shelf for &#34; the future&#34;. I opened the single albums and about a third of them displayed the defects I have been reading about. Things like surface noise, warps, off center spindle holes, etc. needless to say, it sort of freaked me out about the box sets I bought.<br /><br />Well, knowing that I could return if they had problems, I decided to open and check them as my Thanksgiving Day project. I opened the sets carefully and away I went.<br /><br />Results:<br /><br />Set 1- believe it or not - not one problem. They sounded great and looked wonderful.<br /><br />Set 2- many of the lp's looked like they could have problems(scuffs) but they sounded great too. Only two exceptions. Help had several clicks on it where the scuffs were and sgt pepper  - side two  - had the same. Other then that- a nice set. I really listened closely to Abbey Road which supposedly had real problems- they were fine too.<br /><br />Both boxes were in perfect shape and both were packed well. So, yes, I had to open them but at least I know they are in good shape. This was on my mind since last week when I received them but no more. The single albums I received that had problems have been sent back for replacement.<br /><br />Maybe I'm lucky, but I know I am very happy with the new Beatles remastered LP's. hope this helps set your mind at ease....a bit.

I am now looking out side the square and loving the results so far.<br /><br />Would recommend to anyone.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|It was nice to be able to rent it from Amazon.com with it being a new release. My children enjoyed watching it and it was nice to have 48 hours to view it in. We were able to watch it several times during that time period. We liked it well enough I'll probably purchase it to own at some point in the future!
B004MPESSY|5.0|Is a good movie, I loved the reveange of the girl, and all the actors were unbelievable good, I suggest this movie.
B003QSMCKO|5.0|Rented this on Amazon.com to watch with my family. Several years ago we lost our DVD recording of the movie, but really enjoy the music and storyline. We have Mulan 2 and have watched it numerous times recently. The price to rent was reasonable and we had 48 hours to again enjoy Mulan. We will purchase a DVD of this again because we like it so much, but until that time, it's nice to know we can rent it and watch it from Amazon. com.
B00004OCQ2|5.0|Dusk, has been in my collection for years. I have listened to it on and off throughout, but never really listened to it, apparently. Wow!!! I dont know what took me so long. I guess the fact that I have been listening to it for the last week in my truck makes a difference vs. listening to it in the garage while working or something.<br />This is my favorite Badlands effort. I have always followed Jake E Lee. After all, him on Bark At The Moon is what got me playing guitar. I enjoyed his playing in Badlands more though. While the previous releases have some stronger songs here and there that hit the mainstream world, I cant get enough of Dusk.<br />What makes it even better, is that I discovered they put this together in a studio in 8 hours time. Which makes it even better, showing their shear talent as a group. Greg Chaison the bass players really gets down during this release as well. It seems he had more room to breathe and this guy can play. Where he is now and what he is doing is beyond me, but he is not currently active. I hope him to resurface soon as Jake is in the works to do. I truely cant wait to hear what Jake has to offer up for us in 2013.
B008458O3S|3.0|This is good clean well presented puzzle game which will keep you entertained for a while. The graphics is nice and in this game you just draw train tracks using your fingers so that your trains go to stations of a matching color. Then you push play and watch the cute little trains travel along the paths you created for them. If everything works out well you then advance to the next levels.<br /><br />The challenge part of the puzzle comes from drawing multiple train tracks around obstacles and timing the trains accurately so that they go to the correct station. The levels get harder as you progress but nothing impossible to achieve.<br /><br />Having played this game for few levels I found out that there is possibility for kids to click on links that this game provides for additional game downloads so watch out for it. Also it keeps nagging to like on Facebook especially after playing some levels. The best thing to do for such apps is to turn off WiFi when you play them.<br /><br />Nevertheless well done, well presented game. Three Stars!
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Great first album from a seemingly genuine person and artist.  He deserved to win AI and now can be himself
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I chose this rating because I love how Christian finally shows that he is willing to &#34;change&#34; just for her, and he makes it pretty clear that he's never done that. I just love how close that got and continue to get.
B008ENA74E|4.0|This book was a fun read but if you are in the finance industry, it was a bit too basic. Also, I found the ending a bit abrupt and the author failed to make the case of why he actually left Goldman. I would recommend this book for a light fund read. However, don't expect something revolutionary.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|When I first seen these books, I didn't think that I would like them, but when I started reading them.. I couldn't stop. I was addicted. I didn't think that they would last long and I was right, but there was a part of me that wished that she didn't leave him. That's when I had to buy the other two. It wasn't an option. I HAD to know what happened. I'm already re-reading them. I finished Fifty Shades of Grey in a day because I didn't stop reading. These books are fantastic, and I'm glad I gave them the chance. They're officially my favorite series.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|A friend got me hooked on this series and I am buying them all. Great quality video and the story line is intriguing. I can't wait to get the next season.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love this book. I honestly think it's my favorite out of the three because first, they get married, they have the babies, and l like how the last two chapters are from Christian's point-of-view. Overall, this is the best book. They go through so much, yet they stick together through it. Anastasia changed Christian, but clearly it was for the better.

B004SRNH10|2.0|If some app says that you need to install Adobe Air, install it. Otherwise, don't. Adobe profits by creating mediocre, bloated software that eventually becomes &quot;required&quot; software.

B009PEPML4|4.0|Heard portions of this streaming for free when it came out and it was my first exposure to GY!BE.  It's not music that I could listen to on any occasion but I have become a fan--purchased it here on Amazon at a no-brainer price.  After my first full listen, I guess you could say that I was stunned and couldn't listen to any other music for a couple hours.  I really couldn't think of anything that made sense to follow.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Took a few tries and two different vendors to finally get my hands on 2 that are keepers.  Two of four sent to me had cosmetic flaws-one blemished face, inside the glass, the other a blemished case, but once you get a cosmetically \\"good\\" one sent to you, this watch is simply beautiful. Very happy with both. Japanese eye for detail amazes me, especially for a watch this inexpensive.  I'll consider the two blem. watches flukes and just concentrate on the two \\"good\\" ones. Build quality is excellent.  Does my heart glad to know at least some companies still have their minds focused on quality at all price levels.<br /><br />After a week, neither has lost a minute. Second hand is tricky to sync, but even a few seconds behind my radio-synchronized wall clock, both keep good time.  Like I said, glad I bought two.  It's easy wearing and as light as a similar sized quartz watch. I bought this as a daily wearer in place of a much heavier swiss stainless mechanical monster I own. The time adjustment knob is a little small for my fingers, but that's not special to this watch. Had the same trouble with other brands too.<br /><br />I expect to enjoy many happy years with these watches. I'de heard of Seiko, but never heard of Seiko 5 before this, glad I came across the watch.  The return process on the blems was painless, to Amazon's credit.  Heard rumors that there are a lot of fakes being sold on the internet so I did some<br />research. (Who fakes a $60 watch?!? geez..) Apparently this watch is grey market in the US, so any<br />one you buy will have a warranty card that is not filled out because it was not sold by an authorized Seiko dealer, so be warned.  I don't expect warranty trouble, so I am not very worried. If I do, I'll take it to Seiko and pay the cash, or just buy another if repairs cost more than ~$40.00.<br /><br />Going by the tag on the band, Seiko's suggested retail price for this watch is $185.00 so Amazon's quite a bargain.  In the future, I will buy directlyfrom amazon, not one of their storefront vendors. The first order I placed was from an amazon vendor who had the watch to me strangely fast, but with no paperwork and in a generic plastic box, not the blue Seiko box.  Watch was a blem so I sent<br />it back, but the swapmeet style packaging and lack of papers disappointed me. I associate that with Ebay and stay away from Ebay for that exact reason. I also have reason to believe that the watch was not as new as the seller claimed- after all, where was the original packing that a \\"new\\" watch comes in? How would it go missing?  That was the only watch of the 4 that came packed that way. All others had the blue box and all docs included.  So if someone out there has watch #141073 (case ser.#) then you got MY old one.. at least one that was sent to me and returned, never worn,  as a blem. That vendor also charged a new price for something that smelled a bit fishy.  To my mind, new-looking watch, minus factory packing, minus factory docs, does not equal the going price minus two bucks. Need to drive the cheezeball vendors back to ebay from whence they came. Ate the shipping on that one.<br /><br />Amazon did hold up their end honorably in all cases.  No complaints there. And I do love the watches<br />at the end of the day.  If you are on the fence about this watch, then buy it.  Great bang for the buck,<br />near swiss attention to detail & fit and finish, well above and beyond the call of duty for a watch at this price.  Keep up the good work Seiko.  The quality is of the band is good, considering the price range.  Seen worse, but not many better.  When this band wears out, I will buy another just like it<br />from Seiko. Let that be the final judgement on my views of the quality of the band.  Heard some say the watch is a bit small for big manly wrists.  On that point, I dunno. I think it's sized to look normal on the wrists of 95% of men. Some guys have big wrists.. ok, maybe not the watch for you if you are in that 5%.  We also live in an era where absurdly large watches have become the norm, so that may<br />be skewing attitudes and perceptions a bit.  I find the size of the face \\"just right\\" and I consider my wrists normal for a 6' + tall caucasian adult male.
0545265355|5.0|I normally don't leave reviews but this series was worth it. I have only read the first two books as I am holding off in reading the last one. I've re-read the first two several times and find something new each time. My friends think I'm crazy because I don't plan on reading Mockingjay until 2014.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have liked John Grisham books so far, and thought I would read the newest one.  It's a shorter book (less than 400 pages I believe), but it holds my interest and so far has some good action and some fun twists.  I'm just about done with it and I'm excited to see exactly how it ends.
B004L0NGEC|5.0|Excellent product. Fast downloading of all albums. Your pictures will look fantastic on the Kindle HD. A must-have if you're at all serious about easy access and brilliant display of your photography.
B00A7ZWUJC|1.0|It's such a contrast from her earlier work. She seems really out of touch with reality. A pampered rich girl acting like she's from the street? Please. Her attempt at being relatable only comes across as patronizing and stereotypical. Have you listened to the lyrics? Normal people don't talk like that. She's a poser. I'm embarrassed for her.
B002DD67XG|5.0|I have loved this album since the first time I heard it, which has been a while back. He gave us a lot of different sounds in one package and the music is still great. If you like James Taylor you probably already have thi one, if you don't then get it!!! Now!!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|This wasn't the game for me. Way to slow for my attention span. Need something faster paced to hold my attention.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Great actors! Great story and a twist everytime.  Each episode gets better and better. Can't wait for season three next year!
B009AZZEU2|1.0|I was excited to see a new Soundgarden album.  Telephantasm was a great album that I got a lot of play out of, but this album just doesn't even come close to energy from that album.  It sounds like a band's first release album.  I still think they are capable of returning to the glory days...material just isn't here.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|I cant get it to work on my new phone. I switched to htc evo and can not purchase downloads.
0345803493|5.0|Fifty shades Dardker<br />It has a strong story line even with the strong explict sexual content. I enjoyed the book.
7883707728|5.0|i didnt watch it as its in chinese but gave it to my friends daug who is from china. she loved it made her welcomed now she has a movie she could watch in her native language, she loved it
034580404X|5.0|I enjoyed the entire series. E.L. James is a talented writer. I look forward to more books from her in the future.

0425263916|5.0|I loved this book, can't wait until the next book come out. This relationship is so up and down. And I can't believe the ending. Can't wait to see what comes next!!!!!
B0070066DI|5.0|Good heat dissipation and low noise. I now can record audio in my room without interference. I had no trouble with the installation. Very simple process that I made by myself. There was no interference with the memory modules.<br />Thanks.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Real insight into to the life and perspective of the deadliest seals of all time and his wife. Would recommend to anyone.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Awesome application for my tablet. I always trust the Weather Channel for the latest and most reliable forcat for my area.
B000AADYYO|5.0|This quickly became my favourite metal album of all time. Ghost of Perdition sets the pace for what is to be a beautiful, heavy and thoughtful +1hr journey through your mind and that of Akerfeldt's. Haunting when it's slow, crushing and sublime vocals and a solid band performance... leaves me breathless every time.
B0078XFYDA|5.0|I give Dawkins the highest rating because the book gives an excellent overview of the present understanding of the prerequisites for life as well as life itself in an easy-to-understand style. This will especially benefit young readers, although I expect many adult people, with a foggy idea of the natural sciences, will benefit greatly as well.<br /><br />The approach to balance myth with reality is interesting but could perhaps have been made with somewhat less emphasis on myth. But, it is easy to circumvent the myth descriptions since they are clearly marked as sub-chapters.
B008TMA1LY|4.0|very fast paced game. takes a lot of concentration.  will need a lot of practice. will play again and again
B009VB7P6G|5.0|My daughters and I loved this delightful film.  The story and wonderful characters and animals kept us intrigued throughout.  We loved the winter land setting and beautiful artwork.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|It is well below par. It lacks the bite of earlier Grisham novels and if I did not know better would think it had been written to pay the rent
B006XBSAP2|5.0|It is Katy Perry at her best she is one of the best entertainers alive, I love this CD it is a must have for any fan.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|Good start which gives an impression of a nice romance adventure, although the story starts to repeat too much in almost every chapter.<br /><br />Haven't reached the end yet.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|The characters are great, the storylines are true Sci-Fi.  If they end the show after the fth season it will be great loss
0525953728|4.0|With a military background myself, I was able to relate to a lot that the author went through in his training.  I believe this is a more accurate account of the events of that night than other descriptions we've read.
B007JF87VS|5.0|LOve, love, love this show.  Infact, left Dish Network bcos they dropped AMC and Walking dead season 3 was about to start!
0525953728|5.0|After the onslaught of inaccurate depictions of this event on television, it's great to be able to get the real story from an operator who witnessed and participated in it. The non-exaggerated, non-glorified account is grounded, matter-of-fact and methodical. It's far from the &#34;enhanced&#34; docudrama garbage that was depicted as recently as 11-2012 on a well-known and respected television documentary channel, proof that ratings count for more than truth does in the minds of television producers.<br /><br />This book is a great, easy read and well worth your time.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I have been waiting for Avatar 3D for such a long time. I've tried bidding for it and lost each bid. I'm so excited that I have it now. I've even invited friends and family over for movie night to share the experience of watching this great movie.
B007P06DJK|5.0|An amazing re-visiting and retrospective of one of the great musical triumphs of the 20th century, a classic that will last and last. It was also, like Robert Kennedy's visit to South Africa in the 60's 'a ripple of hope' and liberation, showing what a force for change and brother/sisterhood, music can be.  The fact that the ANC opposed Paul Simon's initiative is an excellent example of political myopia, and the attempt by Dali Tambo, son of ANC President Oliver Tambo, to justify it, falls ridiculously flat. Miriam Makeba joining his tour put paid to that nonsense. A great classic!
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|It's easy to get tired of when there are no more goals to accomplish. Nearly impossible to fly more than 2500m.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|A GOOD WAY TO PASS TIME WITHOUT USING REAL COINS!! CHEAPER THAN AN TAKING THE KIDS TO THE ARCADE ANYTIME!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I did not see the movie however was told to read.the.book first.  It was a really good.one, kinda slow.at.first.but  then the section where the games started.was.excellent.
B008GXHOFW|2.0|At first it was neat but it has started problems for my ipod glitchy. and mu kindel just turns off ...and the fact I got it for 699 and it reduced to 99 cents not cool
B009P5S11G|5.0|Where do I begin? Rihanna has been on the scene since 2005. This is her 7th studio album in seven years. I think this album puts Rihanna in that legendary class with(The Beatles,Michael Jackson,Madonna,Whitney,Celine & Mariah). She's shattering all types of records! This is an all you can eat buffet of different music genres.  There's something for everybody. I tried looking for filler tracks & couldn't find any. Here's a run down of my favorite tracks. 1.) 'Phresh Off The Runway'(The opening track made specifically for fashion shows/drag shows),2.) 'Diamonds' (The lead single that's being played all over world for good reasons),3.) 'Numb' FT Eminem (This is no 'Love The Way You Lie' But still very solid),4.) 'Pour It Up' (A song made strictly for the strip clubs),6.) 'Jump'(This has to be a single @ some point,Rihanna took the chorus to Ginuwine's song 'Pony' & made it her own),7.) 'Right Now' FT David Guetta (Another potential hit that brings POP,House & Electro all togther on one song),8.) 'What Now' (This song really displays the versatility in Rihanna's voice beautifully), 9.) 'Stay' Ft Mikky Ekko (This may be one of the best ballads Rihanna has sung to date,Rihanna & this guy sung the socks off of this song),10.) 'Nobody's Bussiness FT Chris Brown (We'll know the history of Rihanna & Chris,But this MJ inspired tune is so irresistible),11.) 'Love Without Tragedy'/'Mother Mary' (This may be my 2 favorite songs on the album. This is a preview of two songs in one. It starts out with 'Love Without Tragedy' then flips to 'Mother Mary'),13.) 'No Love Allowed' (a reggae track that kicks ass), 14.) 'Lost in Paradise' (a rock song I can't get enough of), 15.) 'Half Of Me' (A beautiful song wrote by the talented Emeli Sande,Rihanna's vocals are so on point in this song) Then there are two different mixes of 'Diamonds'(track 16. is 'Diamonds meets 'We Found Love' & I love it). I can go on all day about why you guys should buy this cd. I only have one tiny disappointment from this cd. I really want to hear extended versions of 'Love Without Tragedy'/'Mother Mary'. I gaurentee other fans will be craving more of those two songs as well!
B007HACDLK|4.0|Once again, Mitch Rapp saves the day! Althouygh he's aging, he staiil has what it takes. Glad to see Stan still had a role.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|Because it does exactly what it said it would do and very nicely. too.  Magnetic base held the receiver firmly in place.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I chose this book because it has everything from love to hate truly this is an awsome book I know you will love it
B007J7LFTW|5.0|I am so pleased to hear that Ian has put out a &#34;Sequel&#34; to Thick as a Brick. My only small regret is that it was not released like the original (I still have mine) with the full newspaper. The songs are great poignant and funny with a wink of the eye and tip of the hat to the original as well as the time the original came out. Out standing work Mr. Anderson. Thank you from me and all the loyal fans!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Fun and enjoyable game. Would recommend to friends to play. Excited to try the next game. Great graphics and well thought out plot line.
B000FA5SMK|4.0|Very enjoyable, good plot, fine characters, and good humor mixed in to a good mystery.  I like the style of Nelson DeMille's writing, good plot development, likable detective in John Corey and it moves right along.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|So how do you freshen up a series about a serial killer who hunts serial killers? Do you create new twists and cliff-hangers? Do you delve deeper into Dexter's improbable path towards some form of redemption? Do you develop other characters in the story to give the story depth and greater personal drama? Well, the writers for season 6 have managed all of the above and more. I was very pleased with season 6 and as usual was left wanting more. Dexter speaks to our own dark passenger; the side of us that wants to see truly bad people meet their end under Dexter's knife. Let the killings go on!
B009KHDT0C|3.0|I have never seen the original series but I assumed Dark Shadows would be pretty good based on those associated with the film. I felt the movie was okay until the climactic portion of the film. It seemed like the last 30 minutes of the film was spent trying to wrap up subplots in a hurried and somewhat sloppy manner. Too bad because it could have been better!
B005K01VZS|5.0|Truly makes you think about why you are here and what God wants for all of us. Improves your faith.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Could not put it down such a real heart felt story<br />If you have child you can totally relate to this
B003ASLJO0|5.0|A one of kind movie with one of the greatest actors of all time. Show's how even someone as impenetrable as his character has feelings deep down inside.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I kept putting this one down and coming back to it<br />She seemed a  bit unreal and the ending seems unreal
B00992CF6W|5.0|My friends talk about it all the time. Got this played all day! Now I'm cool talking about it too!!!!!!!!!!!:)$(:!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love MLP and this game has me grinning ear to ear. It has characters we love and all the original voices. What could be better?
B0002KQNJU|5.0|A good and deserved trip into nostalgia. I can reccommend this picture to the 'thinking' youth of today sadly so caught up in the detritus of so many modern 'fantasy' films.
1423140605|3.0|I love pj books. Favorite series ever can't wait till next book. A must read for everyone. Order now. And I said now!
0865479186|2.0|The book is best to read if you are not familiar with the whole range of bad science, if you have read any books on this topic it overlaps them and does not provide you much. I must however say that I have read better books about the same topic and this one is at best mediocre in comparison.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this app so much its fun for me and my dad I play this game like 4 times a day! I think you should get this game!!!!
B009YG2ND8|5.0|A great game once again returns to me, and better than ever! I love having a mobile type of gaming and Final Fantasy is no doubt my favorite game series! I'd love to see more of these games for the Kindle Fire (Final Fantasy IV? Perhaps throw in Interlude and After Years with a graphics makeover?). My birthday's coming up and I plan to get some Amazon giftcards. I'd without a doubt save them for Final Fantasy games for my Fire!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  Im going to get the next book right now.  Can't wait for dinner to be over so I can read it!
B006FK7SZ4|1.0|I don't know why I can not even sign in because I already have an account online. I do prefer the people here than okcupid but the app is not working for me. It constantly says that I am offline and feature disabled. There is no login feature. This is annoying. I did not have this much trouble with okcupid.
B008458O3S|5.0|I'm a huge fan of puzzle games, and this one was both fun And challenging, which is key. I highly recommend it!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I just love this movie. It is positive, upbeat and has a great take-away message for kids (and adults). I totally suggest getting this or seeing it if you have not already.  Just wonderful
B008K6HN8I|4.0|Got the ES File Explorer for my Kindle Fire.  It is very intuitive and easy to use to navigate the files on your mobile device.
B005UBNKWO|5.0|Cheap, fast, loaded with features, and stays cool. Always been an amd fan but excited about these new apu setups!
B0086700CM|5.0|I was so EXITED to know that it was out on the KINDLE FIRE!!!!I couldn't believe it I got it the day it came out on my Ipod and then it happend on the kindle HORRAY!!!!
B009RI4FRU|4.0|Movie was nicely done. Bruce W and Bill M. were awesome in their performances. Good movie for a relaxing evening of fun.
B0084B5TK8|4.0|It kept me on the edge but I wondered if I had to read the whole book for the solution to be on the last few pages?
0786185791|4.0|The Dharma Bums, considered by many an American classic, is a rambling account of a young man finding himself during the 1950s. A well written story describing an  era when hitchhiking and riding the rails were common and relatively safe for young men seeking to find themselves. Ray wanders in and around the west cost of the US and into Mexico, drifting from one meaningless adventure to another. The characters he encounters and befriends are sterotypes of that time in American history when the Beat Generation was \\"doing their thing.\\" Drugs, alcohol, casual sexual encounters, were all part of one big party while considering the Zen of Life, Buddism, and truth. The foolishness, and at times the insight, experienced by those leaving home and stepping into the bigger world are universal.
B008OM0EDO|1.0|Could not even watch the entire movie! It was horrible and offensive in many ways!!! Do not purchase or even watch this movie!
B009NQKXYK|4.0|Exciting, fun at times and interesting plot, great cast, with the very sexy, tough and vulnerable Noomi Rapace but ultimately the writing was poor. Generally emotionally flat when compared to the heightened suspense, character development and dark humor of the previous films. Many, many missed opportunities in the screenplay. I love the &#34;Alien&#34; films which is why I gave it 4 stars.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|It was hard to follow and maybe that was the point. It was incredibly well written and totally absorbing.<br />The theme of the all powerful corporation scared the hell out of me and needs to be a public discussion.<br />I can't wait to see the movie.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Terrific cast of characters and rich story will keep you coming back for more.  With Amazon instant video, this is must see tv.
B00992CF6W|5.0|well minecraft is a really fun game but 7 dollars I got this game for free and the full version<br />Step 1 Go to device and allow installation of application.<br />Step 2 Go to 4shared.com<br />Step 3 type minecraft pocket edition. apk<br />Step 4 click on the version u want(p.s u need to create a 4shared account<br />Step 5 click download then where it says 20 seconds click that<br />Step 6 it will download then finish and u will install it<br />Step 7 PLAY<br />P.S this works with all angry bird's<br />Your welcome
B00338QENI|4.0|This is a great book, and I almost never like non-fiction.  Not only did I enjoy reading it, I also learned a lot.  I highly recommend this book.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|Putting Will Smith's talented child together with the charasmatic Jackie Chan made a  delightful film.  Using children of Jaden's age worked far better than the first Karate Kid (Ralph Macchio), in which teenage agnst and hormones clouded the coming of age in my vision.  Another good aspect was using China as the backdrop, a country in which familial honor is so revered.  The ending of the tournament, at which the entire team of the bad kids turned from their own sensei to honor Dre's, was far better than the way the first Karate Kid concluded.
B008458O3S|5.0|I enjoyed Trainyard because it is made with pratical patterns. This is not easy but it is interesting enough to focus on its objectives. It really exersices your mind. I hope you enjoy Trainyard.
B00003CX9W|5.0|This is destined to gather dust on my shelves until I am much older and need to listen to it, to watch it, to revel in it again.  I've had a VHS version for years, drawing on it when I've felt depressed or just in need of a lift.  The ending, for a Roman Catholic such as myself, is the most moving part of the film.  The Ave Maria in the background as Good conquers Evil is simply majestic.
B009AMAKSQ|5.0|I'd put \\"The Perks of Being A Wallflower\\" in the same ranks as some of the most memorable coming-of-age films I've seen, such as \\"Some Kind of Wonderful,\\" \\"This Boy's Life\\" and \\"Adventureland.\\" \\"Wallflower\\" is a superbly acted drama about a high school freshman's first year in school, with great performances from the three young leads (Logan Lerman, Emma Watson, and Ezra Miller), a nice supporting role featuring Paul Rudd (who delivers a memorable performance, despite not having much screen time), and a lyrical, sensitive script. The dramatic scenes cover a lot of thematic ground, flow naturally, hit all the right notes, and never seem forced or contrived. I feel that Oscar nods are totally deserving for Logan Lerman and Ezra Miller, both of whom give some incredible performances in intense roles that demanded a lot of dramatic range. A beautifully-made and emotionally satisfying movie and an impressive directorial debut for Mr. Chbosky, who directs from his debut novel.
B005DI9906|5.0|The first version by Korda has yet to be surpassed.  Each of the later films freely uses much of the background scenery/action from Korda's first excellent film, and the magic of Clements, Richardson, and Perez make the film work so well.  Each is faced with the question of lost honor and rises above it.
B000BKDOB6|5.0|Though I may not understand most of the songs on this CD, it is one of the most compelling records I have ever encountered.  I was literally obsessed with it for the first 2 weeks I owned it.  It is a truly great album, one that is timeless.  I am so glad I discovered it, almost by accident.
0446581356|5.0|I love this book! It provides a very in-depth explanation of everything and te images were very detailed. I love the book and would recommend it to everyone, from beginning makeup artists to profrssionals.
B008J34466|3.0|I was excited to get a Pink CD until I listened to it. Much too vulgar to suit me. I've never been a prude, but I don't see where the vulgarity adds anything to her music.
B009B8YZKS|5.0|As a miniseries on Youtube, the drama was a bit drawn out at first. But the story was told very well. Another reviewer made a comment about this being a Starship Trooper knock off... apparently that reviewer only saw a few minutes of Starship Troopers, because the socioeconomic themes developed through Starship Troopers (while I do like them) are completely absent in Halo. Instead, Forward unto Dawn does an excellent job developing the premise of internal conflict and struggle of a Cadet under presure about who he is and how he makes that personal distinction, and what he does when he is called to action by one of the most powerful figures in Halo history. His struggle, his loss, his sacrifice and his choice. Wonderfully done and lovely to experience.
B005LAIH54|3.0|The special effects were good but the story line was too weak and predictable. I am glad I didn't go the theater to see it and I plan to give the video to my daughters fiance for Christmas.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|Entertaining. Good read, left you wanting to read the next volume. Although I'm far from being a teenager I recommend this series to all ages.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|All of the music on this album is beautiful and haunting.I really love the opera and I love this album of  classical music.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book uncovered so many questions that I had after reading the first one it made you not want to wait for the third
B000VBIGD6|5.0|This video is a favorite traditional Christmas movie for my family.it is funny,bitter sweet and everything works out in the end.
B001NKI60W|5.0|it was so fun and the actors in it did a great job. could not help but pat your foot
1878424319|5.0|An easy way to center yourself and create a life that is filled with beauty, love and peace. Another must read book.
B00116FT6M|5.0|The music was great. The actors were just the perfect fit it was a fun movie to watch with a smile
0140177396|5.0|\\"Of Mice and Men\\" features two migrant farm workers during the Great Depression in California.<br /><br />The book is about dreams. George and Lennie just want a piece of land to call their own, and they believe in this dream strongly enough that other characters start to buy in too. A place for soft things; a place for independence; a place for respect; a place to live in peace. This is tied in very strongly to socioeconomic status, age, and race, and the issues that it brings up about the American dream are as relevant today as they were then.<br /><br />The language was interesting. It is apparent that the novel was written many decades ago, and there are a bunch of turns of phrase that I had never heard before (but could guess at, for the most part).<br /><br />I liked the structure. One character was disagreeable and one character was mean, but there wasn't really an antagonist. It really was a good description of the best laid plans of mice and men going awry. I like this style because a lot of the injustices that happen today aren't the result of one villain's wrongdoing, but rather a system that makes people poor and hungry and where people don't understand one another. For a short book, Steinbeck does a very good job of creating empathy with the different characters such that the reader can understand their wrongdoing and still appreciate them as a person.<br /><br />Something that I learned: in the US, you can't execute mentally handicapped citizens for their crimes, but the Supreme Court left it up to states that practice the death penalty how to interpret that. Apparently, Texas' standard is that someone is exempt from the death penalty if they are as intelligent as Lennie Small [...]. Horrifying.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|it was hard for me to get into this book. but I also could not put it down just keep thinking what comes next
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I'm a Grishham fan who waits for his next book,and I buy it as soon as it appears on the shelve of my local bookstore.  He's probably the only author I buy in Hard cover, sometimes at the full price.<br /><br />This story is a fun story, about a guy who gets screwed by the Feds. but plans and executes a very clever retribution.  While it's a bit of a stretch, it's fun to see the bad guys (the Feds) look like amateurs.  Any one who gets weary of the federal government, and is concerned about politically ambitious prosecutors who abuse the court system to promote themselves will love this novel.  I anticipated what was coming, but it was just a fun read, so well written.  Grishham is THE master story teller of his genre.
B009VB97EY|3.0|I am glad I did not see it in the theather.  It was slow and never was sure of the plot
B009WO7NQO|5.0|if you guys think you should get the Yoda planet. GET IT! because it is awesome I'm stuck on 11 but still awesome
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Once again Disney did such a great job it was full of fun, sadness and just such a joy to watch
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read all of Vince Flynn's Mitch Rapp series books, including his latest, \\"The Last Man\\".  Like all the others, I couldn't put it down.  The scenes where Rapp confronts and confounds fools, both foreign and American are delicious.  My sincerest hope is that the CIA actually has some Mitch Rapp calibre people out there working for us.  If there are, God bless them.
B007URCTOG|5.0|i loved this movie it was so good and the actors did such a good job and i watched it over and over
B0091V6TF4|5.0|Great cd with all major title songs for 007. I recommend to all who new to 007 music. This is only one you need

0761171703|5.0|I was a little nervous about all the 5-star ratings... Thought it was probably the book publisher hiring people to write good reviews... But, \\"Dancers Among Us: A Celebration of Joy in the Everyday\\" seemed like an interesting concept and the few photos I could see looked inspiring.<br /><br />So, I took a chance and bought 6 copies - one for myself (I'm a photography instructor who stresses finding beauty in the world) and the other 5 would be gifts for a few of my photographer friends. We are always looking for people doing inspiring imagery, expressing joy and especially doing creative things.<br /><br />I totally forgot about ordering them... And they just arrived. Awesome! Lots of amazing photos... So many make me smile and laugh. What a trip it must have been to work on this project!<br /><br />The book is mostly photos, which is good for a photo book. I am looking forward to reading what is in it though, especially the \\"About the Photographs\\" section in the back. I love reading about how photos are made.<br /><br />Thanks to the photographer and the dancers for creating such a fun body of work. I can't wait to see my friends' reactions when they open these gifts!<br /><br />Awesome Book!<br />RA<br />Santa Fe, NM
B005USZML4|5.0|John Grisham books are all a delight to read. The Abduction is definitely a middle school read but still a very good story. I have been looking for some books that my grandson would like as he is middle school and I believe this may be just the type for him. Easy to understand yet not baby material. And just enough drama that even the adults can enjoy it. I like a little more action maybe a murder or big trial type thing, but hey a little tame never hurts anyone once in a while.
B008PWN0I4|4.0|This transmitter is the tiniest one I have ever seen.  The size is incredibly small.  As more and more devices come with standard bluetooth, this device gives discontinued devices such as the Ipod nano 6th generation some life.  It does stick out a little bit, but if you put it with the lunaTIK watch strap you will have one great gym buddy on your hand.  (In this case on your wrist)<br /><br />P.S. The lunaTIk is having a 50% off discount on their watch strap.  I got the BLACK lunaTIK watch strap (retail value for $89.99) for $40 bucks plus shipping and handling. You just have to type in LAST CHANCE into the discount code box.  Just tried it moments ago and it still works. ( 3:14pm, November 21, 2012)<br /><br />Bottomline:<br /><br />Pro: well worth it if you want to give your Ipod nano 6g a new life.<br /><br />Con: The alleged 24 hours continuous playback will go out the window with this little device attached to your nano.  I got about 4-5 hours of playtime on bluetooth mode.<br /><br />Good Luck!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I found this book to be more than I ever expected.  When I first read a summary I didn't want to read it, (death of a young person/perhaps by the hands of another young person).  It was so much more!  Going to present it at my book club!<br />I have no book that I could compare it to.  The depth of feelings of the parents of the possible killer appeared very real.
B003CIG7AE|5.0|Bought this for On My Way Back Home.  I was searching for another song that includes &#34;Cause I'm on my way back home&#34; and found this on YouTube.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|I did this DVD as a Birthday Present for my nephew. And that was our favorite movie in the year of 2011.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|I've watched this movie a few times and love it every time. It's one of those movies that you have to own.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|I did got this DVD as a Christmas Present for my nephew. In the summer of 2011 this &#34;Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes&#34; was our favorite movie.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|its fun and ur on a role until u have to spend ANOTHER 3 bucks just to get to next level! rippp offfff!! :-/
B003HARV3Y|4.0|In the fall of 2010 I did this DVD as a Birthday Present for my Nephew. This was one of favorite movie of that year.
B0013O123Q|1.0|This reminds of a photographer showing a badly focused photo with noise and no real composition but because of the photographer's social status, the photograph is regarded as art, when a 4th grader could take the same photo.  Everyone looks at the photo and no one dares to say how shitty the photo is actually.  The filming is supposed to create a different fresh perspective and angles but it is really some high schooler trying to show off a technique and overdoing it.  The violent rape scene is done in detail, brutal, crude but real.  This is the only real enthralling part...can even be called art.  However, it dwells excessively long on it, with no real clear purpose.  If you are pulling a tooth and need something more painful and distracting, watch this..it will annoy you enough to forget about your tooth getting pulled.<br />The reviews here are more entertaining than the whole movie.
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|I own both the first two seasons of this show and I absolutley love it. I would say to any over 13y/o to watch this show. I love the action an suspence there's usually a catch to the show. If you've liked csi or ncis this show is perfect. I'm a military buff an didn't know how i'd like the series but I've become hooked. Also may I suggest watching covert affairs, burn notice and nikita there all highly addictive shows.
B002LFAHBO|5.0|Cute love story where several relationships and mini-stories all end up coming together at the end (Pulp Fiction-like).  An amazing cast keeps you laughing and crying and feeling good.
B003TJR2HS|3.0|Works ok but comes off dock every time you remove iphone which is a pain!  Then you have to put it back on the dock  again.  Do not have to remove the case on iphone to use it.
1590171993|5.0|I can't say what it was exactly that drew me toward this novel, but I do know what kept me reading it. It's written in an unadorned fashion that pulls you along on its story. It's a novel about one of those unspoken heroes of life, the kind you can't help but admire and root for. I left this novel with a great deal of admiration and sympathy for the main character. He has his faults, infidelity chiefly among them, but the way he takes life's trials in stride and never complains reminds me of those older, stoic figures I knew growing up. I couldn't help but shed some tears at the novel's conclusion, a certain sign that this was a quality work. This novel is recommended to anyone looking for something depressing, but ultimately uplifting at the end.
B001AQT0UY|4.0|Film bellissimo..un classico ..!<br /><br />La qualità video purtroppo risente tantissimo della pessima rimasterizzazione in 1080p<br /><br />Belli da \\"scoprire\\" i contenuti extra..qualche scena tagliata MAI vista..<br /><br />Dò 4 stelle solo per la trama del film..la qualità visiva ne meriterebbe 2 .. PECCATO<br /><br />inoltre la custodia nel mio caso aveva un piccolo angolo rotto
B008O9V4C2|4.0|i love how after all this time that donald fagen can still write and perform a great album w/ strong production skills and equally talented studio musicians. another winner of a solo album. ever since his 1st nightfly he has continued to put out great quality albums. i'm glad to have this as part of my collection.
B006SMLAMQ|2.0|I downloaded this app. It has no instructions and the app won't let me add a location - the first basic step  to getting weather information in my area. Who do I complain to? How do I get a refund for this bad app?<br /><br />It basically doesn't work on my Kindle Fire. Very disappointed with Kindle Fire Apps so far.
1469984202|5.0|Just, wow.  (That's really all I had to say, but since Amazon insists on 20 words... this was at least as good as the last big-deal Hugo Award-winning novel I read.  Maybe better.  Way to go Mr. Howey!!)
B008KE3960|5.0|It's easy but challenging and really fun! Great time waster! I would definitely recomend it and cant imagine waiting at drs offices with out it!
B006L9B6TI|5.0|The Secret is like the theory, the Power is the underlying source, and the Magic gives you the practical steps to make to bring greater happiness into and a more positive perspective about your life.  I have recommended this book to other friends who have also felt it changed the way they thought about the blessings big and small. Like attracts like, and gratitude is the key.
0785152458|5.0|This is pretty much the script for the second movie and very well put together. Red Mist is back but has brought an army with him and his goal is utter chaos and full payback for what Kick-Ass did to his father. If you enjoyed the first series then you will dig this. Be sure to pick up the Hit-Girl series once it's released. Also if you want to read the stories in chronological order you will want to read Kick-Ass, Hit-Girl, then finish with Kick-Ass 2. I don't feel it ruins the experience if you read them out of this order.
B0018CMJSU|5.0|This set of movies is great. The Godfather is perhaps my favorite movie ever and I'm very satisfied with my purchase.
B0060ANP10|5.0|Better known for his blues, Johnny put out this album with a little rocking in mind. I bought it when it first came out having lived in Texas at the time where it was getting alot of air play. I still have it and its still my favorite Johnny Winter album. IMO its his best !
B003XDVVO0|5.0|Comfortable and durable. You better be careful with the size you order.<br /><br />C&oacute;modos y duraderos. Ten cuidado con la talla que ordenas.
B001GJ9G90|5.0|I love the action sequences, mundane relationship issues, and amount of charisma between the main characters present in the film.
B008YZXYY2|5.0|I must confess I wasn't expecting much after Audio Secrecy. I mean I never thought I could get anything better from Stone Sour. I'm waiting for the Part Two.
B008XBHIEY|5.0|This is an oldie but goodie! My teenage daughter watched it with me and was just as afraid of the water afterward as I was the first time I saw it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's a good app, featuring everything from the Pc alpha. You wouldn't have thought they could make the app, but they did. However, the kindle doesn't have pockettool like on the google playstore, crushing my hopes of using a skin on it. But if someone can bring it to the kindle fire, I would be much obliged. So please bring Pockettool to kindle!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is a very efficient and easy to use alarm clock with a significant number of nice features like choosing your own music and fade in audio. I love it and use it all the time. Recommendation: when you set your clock be sure to click save. Its down at the bottom and on Kindle fire you have to scroll to see it. I missed it and overslept when I first got this app. Now I always double check that its set.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|much has already been said about this book, and most of it are right. it´s an extremely well writen story, and very entertaining.<br /><br />it´s the kind of book that it´s hard to stop reading.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|To be quick, the writing was great to begin with and it is even better this season.  Plenty of mysteries to keep you guessing.<br /> Just try it you will be glad you did.
B001F6TXME|5.0|It pays to buy OE products. Works great and is very high quality. Every Nikon owner should have one  that has a tripod..
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this is the best game ever invented halfbrick u r geniuses. all u people who say its boring and u don't like it. u should also put&quot; then again I don't like fun&quot; at the end of ur reviews
B002VECM6S|5.0|This movie is very inspirational and it is overall a great movie!!! If you like Remember the Titans, you will also want to buy this movie. It is a movie that has many sad, happy, funny and tearful moments. I love this movie and it never gets old when I watch it over and over again.
B0092C2X7U|5.0|This is the best game ever once I got the fun has begun<br />so that is why I got it.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds are awesome in this movie. It is sooooo funny especially with Betty White. Sandra Bullock is hilarious. If you like the Miss Congeniality movies, then you will love this movie! Ryan Reynolds is also awesome in this movie. This is not just a chick-flick. It is for anyone that wants to have a good laugh.
B005VPRG10|4.0|muchas gracias. el producto se encontro en buenas condiciones, se revisaron las partes y todo esta de acuerdo a lo comprado
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This movie will be a classic 30 years from now. It is such a good movie. Very inspiring and motivational, but is a movie with a roller coaster of emotions. Has very sad, hilarious, serious, worrying, happy and cheerful moments. It does a very good job of reflecting what life was like during the time when America was segregated in the south during the 1960's. If you like Remember the Titans or To Kill A Mockingbird or any movie that deals with segregation in the south, this is the movie to buy. The best movie ever!!!!
6305754969|5.0|my hubsand and I r john wayne fans and r trying 2 collect all of his movies love em k
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|RED is one of the best action and comedy movies ever. It is an action-packed movie that will never get old because of the comedy that they throw in their. One of the reasons that it is so funny is because during action and serious scenes, out of nowhere they do something funny that is totally unexpected at that time. They say and do funny things in the most inappropriate moments to do or say such things. It is hilarious!! The action is also great. The stunts that they do are very well put together and they are very clever. Their is action everyone other minute.
B00008L3U1|5.0|Love it packing was good we loveed this movie we've bn lookin 4 it 4 a long time and finally got it
0547884591|5.0|I have both of his other books and this book follows the same template.  Lots of information, interesting subjects etc...etc.  He breaks it down in simple easy steps on how to do just about anything you set your mind to do.  Not so much as how to do certain things (although he does on certain subjects), but more along the lines of what to do to accomplish your goals.  The steps to take, the 80/20 rule etc.  If you never bought any of his books, I would recommend 4 hour body, then this book next and 4 hour work week last.  I plan to use his META learning to accomplish some of my own personal goals.  Pure genius, Tim continuous to amaze me.  I love how he breaks down recipes to keep them simple.  He also uses recipes that if your not perfect it will come out excellent anyways.  Lots of fluff I cannot use in the book as well, such as how to skin a deer and other survival techniques.  But like in his other books he gives out a lot of information and you just have to apply what is useful to you.  Highly recommended if you want to learn how to break what you want to learn down to basic steps, how to motivate yourself, and reach your goals in the fastest time possible.  Highly recommended if you love to cook and want to keep it simple, not complicated at all.  Plenty of recipes but what it really does is teach you to learn your own recipes, combining herbs, spices, foods etc so you can create your very own master pieces.  Easily a 5 star book.... but like I said... a lot of fluff....about half the book to 75% fluff for me... but the other 25% pure gold... worth every penny on kindle... and hardback.
0765367297|5.0|This book was so much better than I thought it would be. Great history of Master chief, I just wished it would talk about Reach more.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|It ended the story rather terribly. Killed everyone, no happiness to be found for anyone it seems. A disappointment since the 2nd book was so incredible.
B007HO392S|5.0|This is a good Country Music C.D.!  A strong Man hating overtone, but an upbeat Country tone.  Just my opinion.
0307454568|5.0|The characters in this book were awesome,  The book was fast paced and very entertaining. A little shocking at times but that is life.
B004EPZ084|5.0|I love the variety of characters in this light hearted flick, perfect for a rainy day or random night.  Great acting and good gag reel.
B004W4N55C|2.0|OK. So this app works great on honeycomb and gingerbread.  But...for my Nexus 7 android 4.2.  Cannot search.  If this app comes up free like I got it for, get it! But the n the  mean time don't expect it to work.<br /><br />App...5 stars<br />Support...2 stars.
B002NWRMVS|4.0|Not my very favorite Norah CD but a great one nevertheless!  You just gotta love that &#34;Man of the Hour&#34;!!!!!!
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|We LOVE this movie. I received the package way quicker than expected, it was packaged very securely and the DVD quality was like new.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Excellent novel! Sucked me in right away. I loved the fact that at the end of the book it gives you a glossary of what each flower means. It helped pick out a flower for my grandpas flower for my tattoo.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This new addition to the story of Greg was hilarious, I loved the dance scene when he was awkwardly dancing with Abigail, that was awesome! Can't wait for the next one!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I can't put it down. It's got me wanting to read all of the books!<br />All I can say is wow.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|Many years ago I was working at Macy's over the Christmas holidays.  I was stationed near the gift wrapping area where this film was on continuous loop.  I must have seen certain scenes from it 70 times.  I can still hear the young janitor advising Chris to \\"Throw it on the floor - I get awfully tired of sweeping up dust.\\"  At the end of the holiday season, I had to aquire the film in order to watch it all the way through.  And we still watch it every year.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|So hoping for a next book! I really enjoyed reading these books!<br />I will be looking for more from this author.
0307730697|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and got teary-eyed at the end. It does make one wonder why such a fearless, compassionate guy was called out so early in life. Maybe he was just one who had to pack a hundred years of living into a short space of time. He was human and made mistakes, but when it counted he was there 100 percent. I have great respect for all who serve our country, and I truly respect Adam Brown for all he did for the cause of freedom. God bless his family.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|If you like watching and experiencing British class problems in a male dominated society you will love this series.  Lots of drama and humor.  Series gives insightful experiences of a very romantic time period in history.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Has everything you could want from a book and endlessly so.<br />Didn't even consider watching any movies on flights with this book as a companion.
B0055SWM08|4.0|VERY ENTERTAINING. HOOKED AFTER THE FIRST ROUND. LOOKS EASIER THAN IT IS BUT STILL MINDLESS ENOUGH TO PLAY WHILE HANGING OUT WAITING IN LONG HOLIDAY LINES.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is awesome, to me it is addicting!<br />It keeps you busy when you are bored and have nothing better to do.
B008XOXGL0|5.0|This is a great vinyl, especially for those who enjoy Imagine Dragons or collecting vinyls for their favorite bands! -
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Patricia Cornwell has delivered another fast pace medical crime novel. However, the narrative tying the Boston activities and a paleontology dig in Canada is NOT believable and detracts from a lot of the action.  Detective Marino is getting a bit tiresome and would not survive the HR of current police departments.
B0026P3G12|3.0|I may be the lone voice not absolutely in love with this album.  Clarification:  I LOVE Susan Boyle singing, BUT I think the producers of this album were misguided in their efforts to release a \\"quick\\"  album and get her out to the public.  Several arrangements are odd  -  for instance,  in \\"How Great Thou Art\\"  why sing just the chorus three times in a row?!?  If they were going to include traditional hymns on this album,  why not sing some or all verses?  secondly, and more important,  Susan's singing sounds restrained- for lack of a better word.  She sounds as if she is holding back and not giving the 110% effort  we saw on her TV audition.  Almost as if she is afraid of being too loud or too intense.  But, once again,  I LOVE Susan's singing and she has amazing talent.  I just wish her first album had a)  better song choices, and b) stronger performance.
0425263916|5.0|I started this series after finishing the Grey's series. This second book was even more interesting than the first one as bring some change and some twist that keeps you wanting for more. Now just being patient till the third book comes out.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|A perfect ending to a riveting story. The characters are totally believable and oh so memorable. I loved the trilogy from beginning to end.
B003L77FYS|3.0|The DVDs were in perfect condition, but the case was a little worn. The prongs that hold the DVDs in place are non-existent so the DVDs fall out. I guess I'll just be really careful opening the case so the discs don't get damaged in the future. Other than that, I love having another fabulous season of this show!
B009GESJH2|5.0|This is the Kid Rock album all the haters have been waiting for. The ones who said he went soft or has gone country. This album brings it all full circle.<br /><br />There's something for everyone. A huge hidden gem on the album is The Mirror. If you've followed Kid Rock throughout the years or have enjoyed his music in the past, pick up this album. You won't regret it!
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Brill book best read in a long time. Could not put it down, get it u will not b disappointed. 5 star all the way
B0063GORYU|4.0|customiseable for different levels of play from almost easy to impossible.  You can change<br />some features that annoy you.  Fun
B000P7V45S|5.0|Genesis are well known for the two remarkably distinct phases in their music, first the prog rock then the pop-rock. The band has shown outstanding experimentation in stylistical crossovers, innovative soundscapes, performance techniques, and metaphor- and humor-packed storytelling during the first half of the 1970s. \\"A Trick of the Tail\\" was release in 1976, a year after flamboyant lead singer Peter Gabriel had left the band, and roughly a year before guitarist Steve Hackett would also leave the band. This critically acclaimed album came to life through a mist of widespread skepticism about the fate of the band, and could be considered as an apex of the whole prog rock phase. The next album (Wind & wuthering) would mark its end, showing that the band was beginning to steer in a more pop-oriented direction.<br />So in my opinion Genesis' purely prog rock phase culminates in \\"A Trick of the Tail\\", which makes it so special. In this album, the musicianship displayed by Banks, Rutherford, Hackett and Collins is absolutely amazing. It is no exaggeration to say that \\"Ripples\\" is one of the band's deepest songs at so many levels, and \\"Los Endos\\" is epically defining a whole musical era. \\"Dance on a Volcano\\" and \\"Squonk\\" are genuine explosions of musical energy.<br />If you are approaching Genesis for the first time, this is probably where I would advise you start. Have fun!
030758836X|3.0|The story was different and I couldn't stop reading because I wanted to know what happened....and, guess what... The author blew the ending as far as I was concerned. You can't keep readers on the edge of their seat and then give them THAT.
B000002J1M|4.0|If you are interested in following the evolution of a rock band's distinctive style, this album together with \\"Nursery Cryme\\" is an inevitable stop. Genesis by the time of release of \\"Foxtrot\\" had already evolved substantially from their beat- and blues- influenced origin to something really peculiar, yet never as cerebral as other prog rock myths. However, the evolution was still ongoing.<br />On this album, the overall band's musicianship -- with Collins' masterful drumming -- is awesome, and some of the tracks are authentic musical landmarks. The mellotron opening \\"Watchers of the Skyes\\" could be the perfect soundtrack of either a documentary on symphonic rock or a vintage sci-fi movie, and \\"Supper is ready\\" (the centerpiece) will take your ears and heart on a journey of absolute awe. Formal authorship was equally distributed among all band members as customary in that period, however I suspect that Tony Banks should be credited for most of the passages that make this album stand out in a crowd of albums.
1846556007|5.0|This book starts us off with the character Harry Hole of the series written by Jo Nesbo.  What a great start.  Harry stumbles through his life that he manages to keep living all the time hunting a serial killer.  We get to see Harry disturbingly drunk and what it causes him to do.  This novel sets us up wonderfully for the Harry Hole series which only gets better and better and this novel leaves us hanging for more!  Our appetites are merely wet with this wonderful read.
B000002J1O|5.0|Genesis are well known for the two remarkably distinct phases in their music, first the prog rock then the pop-rock. The band has shown outstanding experimentation in stylistical crossovers, innovative soundscapes, performance techniques, and metaphor- and humor-packed storytelling during the first half of the 1970s. &#34;Selling England by the Pound&#34; shows some more maturity with respect to earlier, very enjoyable albums such as &#34;Nursery Cryme&#34; and &#34;Foxtrot&#34;. Highlights are &#34;Firth of Fifth&#34;, with its authoritative piano intro and mid-section epic guitar solo, &#34;I know what I like&#34;, with its British pop feel, and &#34;The cinema show&#34;, of extraordinary musical and lyrical sophistication, my personal favorite. An outstanding album, you will not regret having it!
B0086700CM|3.0|people! The game has its bugs but other than that how do you like this game! do not rate a game because it lags! rate it over all
B000002J1L|4.0|If you are interested in following the evolution of a rock band's distinctive style, this album together with &#34;Foxtrot&#34; is an inevitable stop. Genesis by the time of release of &#34;Nursery Cryme&#34; had already steered somewhat away from their beat- and blues- influenced origins, but were still experiencing personal and professional maturation. I believe they ripened a couple years later, yet this is the first album where Genesis sound like no one else. My opinions could be easily disputed by some hardcore fans, but everyone knows that musical reviewing is not an exact science.<br />At the time of production of this album, the band's musicianship was greatly improved by the arrival of two gentlemen: Phil Collins, whose drumming makes the tracks flow with unprecedented effortlessness (by the way, I cannot remember who said: &#34;A band is just as good as its drummer&#34;?), and Steve Hackett, whose guitar technique changes the soundscape for good -- into the unmistakeably Genesis' trademark.<br />Now I will let you in on a little secret (haha): the track that is worth buying the whole album is &#34;The musical box&#34;, one true prog rock gem composed by former band member Anthony Phillips (who had left because of a form of stage fright). Clearly, several other tracks are really enjoyable, my other favorite being &#34;The fountains of Salmacis&#34;.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun and easy to play while waiting for...<br />I always have the game in my pocket and like the automatic complete feature.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show isn't just about &#34;zombies&#34;, it's about the characters and the actors who play them.  They do a great job!  Most of the actors are new to me and play their parts so well that I feel like I know them.  Well, sometimes I don't like them but you can't like everyone all of the time, right? Anyway, the cast is terrific and so is the story.
B00914JWSW|4.0|It was great to hear old cuts of Barbra Streisand's music. I have been a long time fan of her music and movies.
B005IEH7YU|1.0|The pages don't turn consistently in the kindle app. And it sometimes freezes the entire app. Love the original hard copy.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book honestly captures the emotions teenagers go through. It's an amazing book that is incredibly well written. I would recommend this book to everyone!
B008RZF1UO|5.0|I just love this album, I've been waiting for it for a long time. When I listened it I just fell in love with Kamelot again and it became to be my favorite band like years ago. So I have to say thanks to Amazon, for the good service and the very fast delivery, I'm so glad with this website.<br /><br />I recomend this product to all those fans of Kamelot who got sad when Roy Khan left the band, this new album shows you that Kamelot it's still alive and can produce very good music and stuff!!! So enjoy this album, that's all! :D
0345803485|1.0|I don't mind the sex stuff, but it's all the stuff between that is terrible. I don't know a single person who has conversations the way Ana does, where she uses the other person's name in every sentence.<br /><br />Example:<br />\\"Jose, blah blah blah.\\"<br />\\"But, Ana, I love.\\"<br />\\"Jose, I think of you as a friend blah blah.\\"<br />\\"You like him more blah blah.\\"<br />\\"How could you say that, Jose?\\"<br /><br />Those aren't the exact words, but you get the idea. When they're the only two people in the scene, why would she keep saying his name? He knows she's talking to him!<br /><br />I know the author is British, but to have her main character (who's so American she's never left the U.S.) say she \\"phoned\\" someone is ridiculous. I don't know a single American who says \\"phoned\\" instead of \\"called.\\"<br /><br />And to have dialogue separated so often by Ana's inner monologues made for very stilted reading. Imagine driving down a long stretch of road with speed bumps spaced a few feet apart. Reading this book is like that. Why can't characters just have conversations through dialogue without Ana interrupting the flow by thinking?<br /><br />And enough with the biting of the lip. I lost count of the times Christian told Ana to stop biting her lip. This book is so repetitive. The editors should be fired for letting this get published like this. If the finished product is this bad, I can't imagine what the original manuscript looked like.

B0087ZG7HK|5.0|Jurassic Park is a science fiction movie based on the novel of the same name by Michael Crichton. It is a story about how as much as man tries to be in control of everything, life will find a way around the boundaries we try to confine it to. Jurassic Park stars Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, and Richard Attenborough.<br /><br />An incident at a biological preserve on an island off the coast of Costa Rica has prompted a review of the resort by the investors. John Hammond (Attenborough), CEO of InGen, has invited several consultants as guests for a weekend to determine the safety of the park. They include paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Neill), paleobotanist Ellie Sattler (Dern), and mathematician Ian Malcolm (Goldblum). The guests are stunned to discover that the park is the home of genetically engineered dinosaurs. Hammond's grandchildren arrive to join the adults on the tour of the park. However, as a storm approaches the island, an espionage scheme is afoot to steal dinosaur embryos that results in the total failure of the security system. Its up to Dr. Grant to get Hammond's grandchildren, Lex (Ariana Richards) and Tim (Joseph Mazzello).<br /><br />Jurassic Park was an awe inspiring visual effects masterpiece when released in 1993. At that time, very few movies had computer generated characters that interacted with live actors, and none of them at that time had the level of realism seem in the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park. Compared to a lot of other action movies from the 1990s that relied heavily on CG effects, Jurassic Park's effects still stand up fairly well. I am interested in seeing how well it has been cleaned up for the 3-D release next year.<br /><br />Jurassic Park is rated PG-13 for intense science fiction terror. This movie requires a personal judgement call on whether its suitable for young children to watch. There is only a very small amount of strong language, most of which can be attributed to a then relatively unknown Samuel L. Jackson. The main scenes that you may not want your small children to see are the ones where people are killed by dinosaurs, although there are only one or two death scenes that are truly gruesome, as most of them leave the blood shed to the imagination. Basically, I'd let a nine year old watch Jurassic Park, but would be hesitant to let a five year old watch it.<br /><br />Just a note, this is a review of just the movie itself, and not the presentation or packaging of any specific release.main scenes that you may not want your small children to see are the ones where people are killed by dinosaurs, although there are only one or two death scenes that are truly gruesome, as most of them leave the blood shed to the imagination.

B0043RSK3K|4.0|Well written....easy to follow.  The truth is hard to take but as the saying goes if we don't learn from history we're doomed to repeat it.....or however that goes.....Worth the read.  To bad we're not taught the truth from  the time we enter school......then perhaps some of the same mistakes would not be made over and over......

B009AY04A8|5.0|I plays a lot of hidden games but this one, without a doubt, is on the top of the pyramid.  The challenges are top notch and fun to find. Of course, its easy enough for children, but they would need an adult to help them when you switch the ways of finding the objects. I believe this game is better played by adults. I am anxiously waiting for the next adventure.
B006LSZECO|2.0|The characters were unbelievable (I mean, live with a murderer!!), the plot contrived, and ending unsatisfactory. It was intriguing but in the end, ridiculous.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This app is great for time killing. Sadly this game was made so that sometime you will need to pay real money to continue. That kinda sucks. Give this app a try for your self.

B008D28HYS|4.0|This is a fun and engaging logic game. I occasionally wish there was an option for a hint but if I leave the game and come back to it another day I can usually figure it out.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|The two main characters are well developed and as a reader you come to care about them.  The dialogue is believable and edgy.  There is also enough suspense to make you anxious about the outcome, so much so that it is hard to put the book down, which is always a good indication of a gret read.  I thougt it was fantastic and I can't wait for the last instalment.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Grisham again at his best!  The Litigators is like the best of his earlier novels; making for a great read.
1451662432|3.0|When I started reading this book I was plowing through it.  Arnold's re-telling of his early life in Austria and his bodybuildings was 'fantastic' (to use an Arnold word).  I found myself laughing out loud with some of his anecdotes.  Arnold breaking into the movie business was also engaging.  He talks in great detail about his early movie career (Conan, The Terminator) but sort of glosses over his other movies and mentions them in a paragraph or so.  After his body building days, the book is laced with politics.  There is a good balance between his personal life, movie career, business investments and politics.  The middle part of the book is good, but doesn't match up with the first part of the book.  I was still entertained by it.  Then this book pretty much hits a brick wall once he runs for governor.  Arnold really could have condensed this instead of it sprawling out over a hundred or so pages.  You will find yourself getting sick of hearing about California's infrastructure, economic reform, political alliances....boorrrrring.<br /><br />I wound up skipping right over the last political chapter.  Arnold talks about the separation and his love child.  People were stupidly giving this book a poor review (without reading it) because Arnold had a love child. retarded. It's not like he killed anyone. One thing about celebrities, they are always forgiven for their mistakes (except Mel Gibson, no coming back from that one).  The best thing about this book is you see how Arnold's mind works. He just continually moves forward and has an insane work ethic.  'There's plenty of time to rest when you're in the grave'.  Arnold rules.  If you're an Arnold fan, you should give this book a once over.

B0090XG9T4|5.0|I was unaware of the previous release in blu-ray for these films until after I had watched the new release. I see that the previous version got some poor reviews. I have watched the films over the last 24 hours, and find these versions to be stunning. The clips from original; Techniciolor are richly colored, and extremely well done, at least in my opinion. Original Technicolor films take on new life when carefully restored. I do not know if the is a new 4K transfer, but suspect it is.  Warner has been doing wonders with the MGM musicals. Some of the Black & white films are a bit grainy, but still beautiful. Color films not Tecnicolor are also very fine, just not what can be done with Technicolor. The only problem I saw was a couple of spots where the sound did not match the lip movement. Just a small problem, probably because of the reprocessing of the soundtracks which are otherwise excellent, and seemed to be mostly in the old Black & white clips.<br />There are some excellent extras as well. On the third disc are several alternate & deleted scenes which I am glad to see are atill in superior condition. Wouldn't it be nice if warner & othet studioS would insert these scenes whenever they still exist in a film, using brachimg, so those that want to see them would be able to see all of the original film before they were cut for time or some other reason, and not the truncated version.
1401235166|5.0|I love this series.  The stories are creative and engaging and the graphics are wonderful.  This is the first graphic series I got into and I continue to enjoy them.  I don't mind giving up valuable book shelf space for these.  Keep them coming.

B007ZGO7EM|3.0|This is nice to have on hand but not really necessarily important for when you already have a calculator to use.
B003LJQQB4|3.0|As it turned out the plot was very clever, but the story was overshadowed by the flip-flopping in time that was overdone in my opinion and the lack of character development.  I was never able to engage with Grace and felt frustrated by her yes ma'ming all the time.  Couldn't imagine her ever going on to become a famous archaeologist, much less a strong feminist force. In short the characters lacked believability for me.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son loves this game and now he has it when we travel to Grandmas house in the car, great game and great fun!!
B008OOYALE|5.0|i love this game my friend showed me on his ipod touch and its amazing i think its cool you can level up your dragons and watch them grow but you guys need to put new dawn on the kindle fire! my friend bought it for his iphone so i went to look and it wasnt there (kindle fire hd) cant wait for it to come out on the fire!
B004WGIXX4|5.0|Great character development. This is one of those rare romantic comedies where you actually see the couple fall in love, and it's believable!
B003UGLCIA|5.0|Not that I don't enjoy the new horror movies with all their special effects but there is just something about the subtle psychological terror that creeps into your brain as you hear the noises coming from Regan's bedroom as Father Merrin and Father Karras climb those stairs.  Maybe it's the \\"sight unseen\\" aspect of that part that does it for me but the movie is so much more than that scene alone.  I am so glad that they decided to release the extended version with the \\"staircase spider walk\\"....if you've only seen the original version and don't know what that is, the Director's Cut Extended Edition is a must see.<br /><br />Along with that hair-raising additional scene, you get clearer snapshots of Pazuzu's image whereas in the original, you were left thinking maybe you imagined seeing that face for a split second.  I don't know which is worse, thinking you may have imagined an image like that or actually knowing what it looks like and having it burned into your subconscious forever (seriously, could you stop yourself from rewinding it the first time you noticed it and freezing the frame to get a REALLY good look??).<br /><br />The lack of high cost special effects work to this film's advantage because I feel it lends to the feeling that maybe, just maybe, this could really happen.  Okay, I know that the chances of someone's head physically turning 360 degrees is zero, but you have to admit, the movie just wouldn't have been the same without that.<br /><br />Definitely in my top five all time favorite movies.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I have the xbox 360 edition but I'm just waiting for it to be free it needs to go on sale or something
B008ELUEQC|3.0|After a whole bunch of cover albums (including 5(!) volumes of the American Songbook), I can only ask: \\"Rod, what took you so long?'  But make no mistake, those cover sets were all very well produced, and this one continues the streak.  The title track is a duet with C-Lo Green, which works well enough, even if  'Winter Wonderland ' with Michael Buble' does not. The Original song 'Red Suit Superman ' keeps the whole thing going at a good clip.  Other notable guests include Trombone Shorty and Peter Erskine on drums. Rod may be a cover whore of late, but he remains the classy escort variety at least. Sadly, given such a guest list and Rod's talent, I think it still under achieves by a wide margin.

B009HV2JT8|5.0|This movie was everything it said it would be and more.  I really loved watching this movie.  It had all the character and action a really good movie has to have in order for it to be.  I really enjoyed this movie alot.  I would give it a 100.!!!
B000FBFN0Q|2.0|Quick read, pretty cheesy. Wasn't the worst I've ever read, but there's definitely no thinking involved to understand the plot.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|Really good! Makes me want to read the book, but fun to watch nonetheless. Not what I expected-but good! Vampires & funny
B00007LTIB|5.0|You have to listen to it a few times before you realy like it, but once you do, you'll love it, alright!:<br /><br />1.The gates of delerium - If you don't like it at first, don't think it's a bad song. It takes a few listens.<br /><br />2.Sound chaser - This has got to be my favorite yes song, but I still didn't love it at first.<br /><br />3.To be over - A softer song closes the album, and it's very good. It's a very good closer.<br /><br />This is a great album, and I'd recommened it to any yes fan. And better yet, the bonus tracks are UNBELIEVABLY AWSOME, and the studio run - through of the gates of delerium nearly outdoes the original. You must have this! BUY IT! BUY IT! BUY IT!<br /><br />  Like this? Check out:<br /><br /> Yes: Tales from Topographic Oceans<br /> Emerson, lake & Palmer: Brain Salad Surgery<br /> Rush: 2112

1451638450|5.0|I really like this book, like I appreciate all in this series.<br /><br />A lot of people were disappointed by the previous/a few years in the future book because it pulled down previous heroes at the end.<br />(I did not, because the point is however we push ourselves we are all human).<br /><br />I liked this one, but it was dispite her ignoring the basic consistency of human limits, and after all is said and done Ivan acted very much like a slightly taller and slightly slower Miles instead of like the previous Ivan.<br /><br />That was fine, the book was great, and you could argue after all is done that Ivan is basically just a taller and slightly slower Miles.<br />I didn't buy the premise, but I thoroughly enjoyed the book!

0307341577|5.0|I hadn't heard of Gillian Flynn until \\"Gone Girl\\" sky rocketed in popularity, I planned on reading Gone Girl first, but I saw she had written two other books so I decided I wanted to read one of her earlier books first before Gone Girl.  I'm very glad I did!  I was also drawn to this book in particular because the character's last name is the same as mine ;)  so  how could i NOT buy it?!  This book totally engrossed me, sucked me in, i was enthralled with it. I read it in 2 days! It is definitely a page turner.  If you like suspense, you'll enjoy this. Each chapter is written from the P.O.V. of a different character and it alternates from past to present, and between 3 different characters.  Personally, I really enjoyed this style of writing. It is a great suspense builder, i would find myself itching to finish one chapter because i wanted to know what happened to the person in the previous chapter which wouldn't pick up until the chapter ahead!  Well done, Mrs. Flynn, well done. I will definitely be buying your other books.
B009LXEBD4|3.0|i  think  kelly  clarkson  has  had  a  pretty good  career  thus  far  and from  reaping  American  Idol,because  lets  be  real  how  folks  who  have been on  idol  are still  exactly burning up  the charts?<br /><br />anyway  having  said all of that  while i like her  voice i feel  its a  bit early for  a  greatest  hits  package  and  the main  cuts on  here almost  really  good,  but nothing i'd  call  a  memorable  track. i  think  country  pop  in a Olivia  Newton  John  kind of  way  might give her that  track  that stands for her.this  isn't a bad start,just not  what  i  call  greatest  hits product on  a whole. it feels rushed and a act very much still a  work in progress.
B009LL4LMM|5.0|Got this as the FAOTD and absolutely love it. I'm not sure if its worth three bucks when there are other games like it though. It's a simple game where you lay lines down that bounce so the jellyfish can reach the feather. you want to try to get all three raindrops too. (Similar to Cut the Rope which is 99 cents). There are plenty of levels. Semi difficulty levels. Great for kids and for adults. Plus the jellyfish is adorable!
B009GESJH2|2.0|kid  rock  is a  frustrating  act  because  just solely on  the  music  front,  he  covers a  few  styles,  problem  is on an  album like  this  he forgot the  songs  and  settles  for  cliches  of  what worked  more effective  years  ago.  in  truth  musically  he  should  be  more of  a alternative  act,  than  a parity  act  at this stage.  country,pop  and  hip  hop  are all part of his  hybrid  however  nothing  here  ever  touches  on  what  got him over  for  covering  bases  as a artist. this album is just kinda  there with very little hit  and  alot of miss  from  the songs.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|What can you say about Bruce.  Nothing but the best from the boss.  He is great wishmhe would visit the NWbmorenoften.
B008S80PCE|5.0|Bill  Withers  to  me is one of the most overlooked  all  time  greats  because  musically  he  could cover so many bases.  the  man is a poet  and soulful  vocalist  and  craftsman  who  brought the truth  musically.  this  entire  box set  covers  his  recordings  which  captured  his prime and peak  and thensome.  he  had that down  home  folk  soul  and yet his cuts worked at the backyard  bar b  que  and yet you  could stroll  and  chill  out to  his  music  and he had  the church in his thing.<br /><br />if  a  cat like  John Legend  used his voice the right  way  and had some real  songs,  then Bill  Withers would  be his  ultimate  musical  role model. Withers  got it right  without over doing it  and yet musically he cover  alot of styles  without  sounding out of place,  his records were always  well  produced  and  soulful.  great collection
B009AZZEU2|3.0|I was always that snobby teenager that hated what MTV hailed as good rock n' roll back in the early 90's. That being said, I'm surprised no one ever mentions Soundgarden's early work. Like their first album Ultramega OK on SST records or Louder than Love. To me, King Animal is going way back to their roots before Badmotorfinger or the other stuff which didn't impress me. To me-I hear alot of psychedelic flourishes-close to late 80's Screaming Trees. And I hear almost a touch of the new 'Beard metal' or sludge genre coming through. Even Baroness evokes this dirty, melodic sound. I think the mistake people make when they say there aren't songs that hit you as impressive aren't taking into consideration the lack of boost in the mixing and mastering of the songs. Frankly, this material is going for a doomy  and bluesy approach. Doom metal is popular right now. WIth Cornell's vocals over it. I was never a real fan of Staley, Vedder, or Cornell's vocal approaches anyway. They over sing. Anyway, I wanted to put my two cents in. Oh yeah, I think Rage and Audioslave suck. Rage against the Machine evokes this image of a suburban white boy with dreadlocks sporting his Che Guevara shirt he bought at some head shop. And I never thought Soudgarden was originally grunge, they we're post punk back in the Sub pop days. I guess my review is different in that I know this band had a career before you poseurs only listened to what was put out of MTV.....
B001ECDVKE|4.0|I do LOVE this movie! Classic Tim Burton.<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE:<br />I put this in my bluray player, and had an odd situation.<br />The picture worked fine, the music worked well, but the voices and sound effects were absent.<br />It isn't the disk because it works fine in my DVD player.<br />My guess is that it's just because it's an older disk, so if you use bluray as your primary/only player, you'll probably want a newer version.<br /><br />Otherwise, BUY THIS MOVIE and ENJOY!

B003TJR2HS|5.0|Was sent a replacement ipod from Apple for my 1st gen on a recall. Didn' t know that the new nano is stripped down ....no firewire for charging. So using the new one in the car required frequent dedicated recharging which was not necessary with the original ipod. That one keep charging in the car (MB GL) and was always ready.  The dockStubz solved that problem Does exactly what it said it would.  I had contacted their customer service before buying and they were sure it was ok but I could return it if it didn't work for me. No need. Highly recommend. Only sorry I had to spend $ to add a feature which Apple took away.

B009439HEY|3.0|I really wanted to love this, but I'm afraid it's just not quite there.  As a HUGE Genesis (and PG) fan, the remake of many of my favorite classics was enticing.  The musicianship is awesome but there is one major piece missing.  PG's vocals are such an intricate part of their music and this just make that all the more apparent.  I think they should have gone a completely different direction on the vocals - this is like 'we tried to replicate it, but couldn't quite get there'....even the latest David Rhodes solo disc has more PGish vocals (I'd recommend that as well).  Glad I added it to my collection, but every time I listen to it, it only makes me want to go listen to the original.

B0041KVW2K|3.0|I had always suspected that EMI's reluctance to again offer The Beatles albums on vinyl was because, since neither EMI nor Capitol have had their own vinyl factory for more than 20 years, that they(EMI) & Capitol) would be at the mercy of outside pressing plants, and that EMI & Capitol would have absolutely no control over quality. And this is exactly what happened. And EMI & Capitol didn't help things by selecting a pressing plant(for the U.S.A. release) that has a notorious reputation for off-center grooves, off-center labels & noisy surfaces.<br /><br />  I purchased from a popular New York City internet dealer, \\"J&R Music World\\"(albeit through Amazon Payments). The dealer packed the set well with bubble paper. I was luckier than most people. 13 of the 16 records in my set ranged from passable to very good, but the remaining three were horrible, and fortunately the dealer was willing to exchange individual L.P.'s so I wouldn't have to send back the entire box set. Hopefully, the replacement records will arrive soon, and they'll be of acceptable quality.<br /><br />  Of the 3 records that I had to return, \\"Abbey Road\\" was very crackly, and run out groove area was a storm of noise(it looked as if the stampers had been rubbed down with sandpaper at the pressing plant). \\"Rubber Soul\\" had an off-center label on \\"Side One\\", and a repetitive scratch through two-thirds of the song \\"Girl\\". And \\"Sgt.Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" had \\"Side Two\\" grooves that were 1/8th of an inch off-center....and therefore audible towards the end of the side. I am realistic: there is little chance of getting a U.S.A. manufactured 2012 \\"Abbey Road\\" L.P. that will play properly.<br /><br />  I test for off-center grooves by starting to play the first song on a side. i then close the dust cover lid on my(Technics SL1210Mk.2) turntable, then I hold my finger on the dustcover lid, directly over the tonearm's headshell, and I look to see if the headshell is moving to and fro.<br /><br />  4 other records had off-center grooves on \\"side two\\". For 3 of those, the grooves were 1/32nd of an inch off-center, and so not audible, and for one record(side two of \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\") 1/16th of an inch off-center. Fortunately, that side has only 5 songs, and the grooves don't come close to the label area, so playback is acceptable.<br /><br />  And tonight I noticed a defect in my book. The pages are originally printed larger than their intended size, then the excess paper is trimmed off before binding . But one page(Pages 59/60, which includes part of  the \\"Beatles For Sale\\" front cover photo outtake) was seriously folded before trimming. Unfolding the page left a permanently creased and cracked page, and I had to use a scissors to trim off the excess paper flap that was supposed to be trimmed off before binding.<br /><br />  The Beatles are EMI's flagship group, and their music deserved the finest possible manufacturing and quality control. Rainbo Records(the pressing plant that manufactured the records) should put things right for the consumer, but from a standpoint of their manufacturing capabilities, they aren't competent to put things right. In the End, it is the names of EMI & Apple Records that went onto the product, so they should put things right. It is essential that these companies have the trust of Beatles fans, particularly with another Beatles vinyl box(the mono L.P.'s) over the horizon within the next 5 months.<br /><br />  The ball is in EMI & Capitol's court now. The shoddy quality control during pressing is really sad, because much effort went into mastering the music at Abbey Road Studios. The overall sound of the remasters is excellent, though different from previous vinyl editions.<br /><br />UPDATE: On November 20,2012, I sent the 3 defective records back to the dealer in New York City. Unfortunately(3 times) a postal sort facility  in New Jersey mistakenly sent my package to Denver,Colorado so it took 3 weeks for my package to arrive atthe dealer. The dealer didn't acknowledge receiving the package until a week after they received it, then they waited another week before sending replacement records, which arrived December 27,2012. This time,\\"Sgt.Pepper\\" plays outstanding with dead quiet surfaces. \\"Rubber Soul\\" also has quiet surfaces, though with very slightly off-center grooves on \\"Side Two\\", but not enough to be audible. As for \\"Abbey Road\\", I still didn't get a fully satisfactory copy, though it is much better than my first copy.  \\"Side One\\" is fine, but \\"Side Two\\" has a visible(and to varying extents audible) scratch through one-third of \\"Here Comes The Sun\\". The remainder of the side plays passably, but not as quiet as it should have.While not warped at the edge, I can see my phono cartridge going up and down, so there's a warp inward. But, unfortunately, though the dealer packed the 3 replacement L.p.'s in a big box with lots of bubble paper, at some point, someone grabbed the three album covers by the corner(not realizing that these album covers are made from thinner cardboard than in the good ol' days) and irreparably creased the corner(from the lower right corner inwards 1.5 inches) of all three album covers, and it is particularly visible on the rear of the album covers, and the inside of the \\"Sgt.Peppers\\" gatefold cover. It seems that I just can't win. This mirrors my experience getting replacement CD's for the two incorrectly mastered discs in \\"The Capitol albums Vol.2\\" CD box set. At first, Capitol said \\"send back the discs and sleeves\\", then shortly after I sent my discs back, they said, \\"send back the discs only\\"...and of course, when I received my replacement \\"Rubber Soul\\" & \\"Beatles VI\\" CD's, the sleeves were badly creased, because Capitol simply put them into an envelope with no protective material.<br /><br />  Eventually, probably the next time that I order something from Amazon's British company, I'll order a European-manufactured \\"Abbey Road\\" L.P., and hopefully then have a complete box set with all the records in good condition. I'll still have damaged album covers for \\"Sgt.Peppers\\" & \\"Rubber Soul\\", and the factory defect in my book. I am becoming more and more wary of EMI's forthcoming mono vinyl box set. Those records will probably not be offered separately outside of the box set, and unless Capitol & EMI have some system in place for consumers to exchange defective records so consumers can \\"Build\\" a perfect set....I'll have to pass. I already have the 1982 Japanese red vinyl mono L.P. series, and(excepting the phasey, flawed mastering of the title track on \\"A Hard Days Night\\") those Japanese L.P.'s sound fantastic.<br /><br />UPDATE(Jan.23,2013): I eventually did buy a European-manufactured \\"Abbey Road\\" L.P. from Amazon.co.uk, and what people are saying about the European pressings is true: they are of superior quality, with better sound quality,lower surface noise, and better(overall) appearance. But, once again, I got a badly creased sleeve. As it stands now, I have a complete box set with all records playing from passable to excellent, but with three damaged album covers(Sgt.Peppers, Rubber Soul & Abbey Road) and a slightly defective book.  Shortly after I ordered a European \\"Abbey Road\\" L.P.(buying the album again after two U.S.A. copies were bad), I got Capitol's e-mail address and sent them an e-mail about the problems I have experienced. They e-mailed back saying that I would receive some replacement records in 2 to 4 weeks.<br /><br />UPDATE(Jan.25,2013): 23 days after Capitol responded to my e-mail, I received a package(by UPS) from Rainbo Records. Capitol hadn't really entirely understood my e-mail. I needed the \\"Abbey Road\\" record and album cover & album covers-only for \\"Rubber Soul\\" & \\"Sgt.Pepper's\\". Rainbo sent records-only(in generic white album covers) for those 3 albums. And how were these 3 records? \\"Abbey Road\\" was the most satisfactory of the 3 U.S.A.-pressings I've had. Quiet surfaces,slightly warped(but playable), slightly off-center grooves on \\"side one\\"(but not enough to be audible) and an unevenly trimmed edge. \\"Rubber Soul\\" was not unlike the 2nd copy that I have: slightly off-center grooves on \\"side two\\"(but not enough to be audible), but the overall fidelity was superior to the second copy. \\"Sgt.Pepper's\\" was fine; very nearly equal in quality to the second copy that I got.<br /><br />But none of this resolves the problem of the damaged album covers that I got with the replacement L.P's from the New York City dealer. This is the end of my struggles with this box set. I'm not making any further attempts. As for buying 3 of these albums again for the album covers, it would be too risky to do that via mail order. Go to a local record store(where I could inspect the album covers before buying) you might ask? If there only WAS a local record store, I would. As for EMI's forthcoming box set of the mono L.P.'s, if I buy it, it will be the European edition. Rainbo (the U.S.A. pressing plant) can't reliably align the two stampers when installing them onto their record pressing machines.<br /><br />As for the box set with the various upgrades(replacement L.P.'s) that I installed, what I now have is fine for everyday, general purpose listening. Audiophile product? No. Collectors item? The three damaged album covers ensure that it will never be a collectors-grade item. It's a bummer that I've had to put in two months of hassles and waiting trying to build a defect-free set, and this has all been (as the British say) \\"For Naught\\".<br /><br />With this box set, released almost exactly 50 years after EMI started to market Beatles music, the company had come full circle, back to where the marketing of Beatles music began......with vinyl records. Too bad that after all these years, that this box set was a bungled, botched farewell from EMI to The Beatles fans. EMI is now being dismantled, and it is now apparent that Universal Music(who bought EMI) is now having second thoughts and seeking to recoup the enormous purchase price. Universal is now going to sell off much more of EMI than the European & American regulators require, and that ultimately, the only parts of EMI that Universal wants to keep are The Beatles catalog, Capitol Records(and its subsidiary labels) and the \\"Virgin\\" label. Almost all of EMI's non-Beatles UK back catalog is now(as I type this) up for bidding....to, essentially, be auctioned off. This is really a sad day for music fans.<br /><br />UPDATE 2014: I bought \\"Abbey Road\\" & \\"SGt.Peppers\\" AGAIN(from an Amazon \\"Marketplace\\" merchant, \\"Ernie B's Reggae\\") just to get album covers in good condition. And the album covers were in good condition. And how were the pressing? \\"Sgt.Peppers\\" was the best sounding pressing yet, but with the label attached off-center on \\"Side 2\\". \\"Abbey Road\\" was unsatisfactory, with a repetitive scratch through the last 50 seconds of the album. I combined my best(so far) pressing of \\"Abbey Road\\"(the European pressing that I bought from Amazon.co.uk) with the new album cover from Ernie B's, and I combined the \\"Sgt.Peppers\\" replacement record from \\"J&R\\" with the new album cover from Ernie B.'s.<br /><br />Then, due to the off-center grooves on \\"Side 2\\" of my U.S.A.-pressed \\"Help\\" and all three U.S.A. copies of \\"Rubber Soul\\" that I tried, I ordered the European pressings from a Uk dealer \\"Spin CD's\\". Both were superb pressings, but both arrived with damaged album covers. I installed these European records into my U.S.A. album covers. Also, tired of the \\"non-fill scraping noises on \\"Side 1\\" of my U.S.A.pressing of \\"Let It Be\\", I bought a UK \\"Let it Be\\" album from amazon.co.uk. The pressing and album cover were acceptable. I also TRIED to buy a European \\"Please Please Me\\" L.P. from an Amazon.co.uk \\"Marketplace\\" merchant, but the merchant was dishonest, and they supplied the U.S.A. pressing(Amazon.co.uk refunded me, and let me keep the L.P.). This L.P. was a quiet pressing, but with a very slight warp, whichhad no effect on play.<br /><br />And, where does this leave me today?(July 2014). I have all of the album covers in good condition(except a slightly creased \\"Rubber Soul\\" album cover), and the records are as follows:<br />Please Please Me(U.S.A. pressing. Generally fine, with slight warp)<br />With The Beatles(U.S.A. pressing. Slightly off-center grooves on \\"Side 2\\", but not enough to be audible.)<br />A Hard Days Night(U.S.A. pressing. Fine.)<br />Beatles For Sale(U.S.A. pressing. Fine.)<br />Help(European pressing. Fine. I combined this with the U.s.A. album cover.)<br />Rubber Soul(European pressing. Fine. I combined this with the U.S.A. album cover.)<br />Revolver(U.S.A. pressing. O.K.)<br />Sgt.Peppers(U.S.A. pressing. Fine.)<br />Magical Mystery Tour(U.S.A. pressing. Very slightly off-center grooves on \\"Side two\\", but not audible. Sounds great!)<br />The White Album(U.S.A. pressing. O.K., slightly off-center grooves on \\"side 2\\", but not enough to be audible.)<br />Yellow Submarine(U.S.A. pressing. O.K.)<br />Abbey Road(European pressing. Fine. Combined with U.S.A. album cover.)<br />Let It Be(European pressing and album cover. Occasional pops during the first song on \\"side one\\", though this has been improving with repeated plays.)<br />Past Masters(U.S.A. pressing.

159420411X|4.0|I'm not the kind of person who loves every book of this style. I generally think that Malcolm Gladwell and Thomas Friedman just find cute ways to repeat things other people have already said. But I thought this book was completely different. Instead of finding cute new phrases to repeat old information, Nate Silver finds clear and concise ways to convey interesting, new information. I know that none of the mathematics he's conveying is new, but he does an insightful job of explaining how thinking in a Bayesian way can help in forecasting all sorts of world events and how actual outcomes can be used to improve our understanding of how the world works. Despite his non-academic background Nate Silver has made significant contributions to political forecasting. His forecasts are arguably better than and certainly on par with Princeton Professor (admittedly, not a professor of social sciences, so his professor job may not be very relevant to this conversation) Sam Wang. It's not just that Silver's numbers get closer to reality, but that he has a comprehensive approach that uses all information, appropriately weighted and with a wary eye towards overconfidence.<br /><br />Sometimes, I will say, that writing is a little grating (\\"...a stat head's wet dream!\\" - awkward). The chapter on baseball forecasting is pretty confusing if you don't already know a ton about baseball (I don't). And the chapter on Hurricane forecasting seems to miss the mark pretty badly. He has interesting things to say about the numbers around hurricane forecasts, but veers off in a crazy direction when offering a political interpretation of those numbers. He never mentions levees and makes one very brief, uncritical reference to FEMA. After explaining how great hurricane forecasts are these days he basically lays the blame for what happened in New Orleans on the victims. I guess he just wasn't thinking very hard about this part of the book, and neither was his editor. But overall it's a great read!

B007WFR0QS|5.0|I first discovered Emeli after seeing her video for \\"Heaven\\" on YouTube months ago. I decided to buy her album after a hip hop fan I follow on Twitter just couldn't stop raving about how good it was. She has a knack for creating heartfelt music that says exactly what she wants to say, and isn't too loud or too soft and whiney. It's just right. There's something incredibly special about listening to a song, knowing that the words come directly from the singer's heart and experiences. She's a star in my eyes.

B00A7ZXDLQ|4.0|When I first listened to snippets of \\"Unapologetic\\" I didn't get the same excitement that I got from TTT and Loud, but being a true fan I decided to purchase it and listen all the way through to form a better opinion (...it was only 6 bucks anyway, with an added 99 cents for \\"Half of Me\\" from the deluxe). I'm glad I did. I can truly say that this album is a solid effort from Rihanna. Musically, it delves deeper into her R&B/Hip-Hop side, but still throws in pieces of pop, dance, dubstep, and reggae - which is classic Rihanna at this point. She has the ability to mix it all up, and she does it very well on this album.<br />Some of my favorite moments from the album:<br />Pour It Up - Feels like a hip-hop anthem for the radio in the car or the club. It gives me a feeling similar to that of HYFR and Mercy.<br />Loveeeeeee Song - Something like a modern R&B slow jam. It sounds new coming from Rihanna, but it fits her really well.<br />Jump - Party enticing dubstep-influenced track with an Arabic sort of feel. The hook features her nitty-gritty low register vocals, \\"If you want it, let's do it...\\" Sounds great.<br />Right Now - almost obligatory, this is the album's BIG pop record. I'm sure it will be a single sometime during this Unapologetic era.<br />What Now, Stay, Love Without Tragedy/Mother Mary & Half of Me - heartfelt and appreciated emotional high points. What Now is my absolute favorite so far.<br />Get It Over With - psychedelic, wavy. Makes my head spin - in a special way.<br />Nobody's Business - not one of my favorites, but it does make me want to dance. Of course it's the track that gets people talking the most.<br /><br />As cliché as this sounds, all of the songs work together to create something Unapologetically Rihanna. I think I'll be enjoying this album for weeks to come.

B0072GPQNG|3.0|Spielberg has a long history as a master story-teller for both children and adults and has made many five-star movies, but in `Warhorse' seems to have lost his magic touch.<br /><br />Despite a lavish budget, spectacular set pieces and a very real-looking re-creation of the front-line horrors of the 1914-18 war, `Warhorse' is overall a cheesy and unconvincing affair with a so-so screenplay. Uncharacteristically (for Spielberg) poor editing contributes to a rather chopped-up storyline which lacks the usual powerful and engaging narrative continuity found in the films of this erstwhile great magician of the silver screen. The story is all there; it just isn't realised very well.<br /><br />The film has many positives. Spielberg's classic large-scale cinematography is at times truly breathtaking; the horses are magnificently trained & highly photogenic; the soundtrack is good; the attention to period detail exemplary - as far as this non-expert reviewer can tell.<br /><br />However the film's failings make for quite a list: poor casting, unconvincing acting, some peculiar and not-quite-right British regional accents, Germans unfortunately speaking English to each other with German accents (is the audience really judged to be so dumb that they can't read subtitles?), some beyond-believable plot devices which verge on the embarrassing, excessive sentimentality - one of Spielberg's consistent failings but usually offset by his excellent narrative storytelling - together with the poor editing and deficiencies in script make for an uninvolving viewing experience.<br /><br />The film's main failing, however, remains that it is unsure of its audience. Is it a feel-good film for kids? The war scenes are surely too bloody, violent and upsetting for small children. At the same time it's too simplistic, predictable and cheesy to succeed as a serious film for grown-ups. Either way we don't care enough about the characters - except maybe the horse. This unfortunately condemns the film as one of the director's less successful efforts, and will probably deny it `classic' status in future years. You can't help but feel that with such a generous budget and experienced film maker, a better result might have been offered.ilm as one of the director's less successful efforts, and will probably deny it `classic' status in future years.

For me, I saw a positive message of how beliefs play a powerful role in life and that every person has a spiritual purpose to fulfill in their life (regardless of their level of popularity and/or prestige).  \\"Rise Of The Guardians\\" is a good film for those who enjoy cheerful animated movies with prevalent holiday themes.

They're listed on IMDB, so you can see which ones you catch on your own and which ones you need a reminder for. But you don't have to have been a Star Trek fan to enjoy this film. Anyone who enjoys sci-fi will enjoy this.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|What a fun ride.  Very detailed in a frothy kind of way, quite breezy and  funny, a terrific fiction.  We can all hope to be this bright.
B009UMTMKS|5.0|I have been running a start-up for a year and some change, after spending my early-20s trying to hustle into a capital position where I could bootstrap. I mostly wasted my money on &#34;R&D&#34;. This book helped me find the clarity when I hit the halfway point on my Start-up Chile capital. We shortly thereafter pivoted based on feedback of finally testing this elaborate simulation game we'd been building, and started using customer feedback to build exactly the product we needed as fast as possible.<br /><br />Probably worth the $10.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I like the way you can pick the number of pieces &amp;the way the pieces are stored on the side for you to scroll thru them.
B008SVFX96|1.0|This is a stinker of the highest order. I just tossed it into the waste basket because I would not foist this on anyone I know. Sorry, Richie, loved \\"Stranger in this Town\\", can't stand this. Very repetetive. Awful.

B0092MKTL2|5.0|It only makes sense for a new band born from the same town. This album is reminiscent of the first Killers album, Hot Fuss, which focused on the \\"stadium sound\\", including big drums, big synths, and, most importantly, big sing-along choruses. However, where the Killers lost their focus on the past few albums, Imagine Dragons refreshes this formula by injecting a variety of instrumentation and grooves, all led by Dan Reynolds' strong voice and inspiring lyrics. Hopefully, the band continues to keep their songwriting skills honed, but in the meantime I will be listening to this until I go deaf.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Good book- a definite page turner.  Wish the ending had put things together better-was left with an incomplete feeling. I enjoyed her writing style, could visualize the characters.

B008RZF1UO|5.0|Nice work from this band. every album from them is an amazing experience. but this time these guys went over the limit of music to create such a powerful master piece. I can say I'm glad that I pre-ordered it,and now that I have it, I have been listening this album for two weeks and I think I'll keep it this way until next year jejejjeje<br />Kamelot rules
B000SEGUDE|1.0|I plowed through all 509 pages of the print book, knowing full well by about page 100 that this book wasn't going anywhere.  I hoped it would gel together once on the \\"downhill side\\" of each of the stories, but as each one wrapped up, I was left with \\"what the heck was the point?\\"  Blechhh.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved it!  I'm excited to read the next book...very intriguing!  I read it a while ago but I loved the 'back and forth' events leading to the climax!
B009LXEBD4|5.0|i just recently bought and purchased this album of kelly clarkson's and i really,really,really have been enjoying this cd a lot.i think that she put a lot of time and energy into making this album and did a fantastic job doing it.so my opinion is that this is one of the greatest albums ever,so i gave her cd a 5 star rating because it is that great of a album.so anyone who is a big fan of kelly clarkson's and enjoys her music but doesn't have her greatest hits album should buy it because it is worth the wait.i can gurantee it. chrisfan.and keep up the good work kc.

B009GX7I2K|5.0|my family and i main streamed this episode of ncis los angeles and we really enjoyed the show so much.we liked it when they came up with the plan to make it where callen pretended to shoot the terrorist in public and to have him arrested for murder.but we also liked the little bit of humor in it to so me and my family cannot wait for when the whole season comes out on dvd.chrisfan.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I can see where other reviews note the 'Twighlight for adults' or how the writing itself was not top notch, but I can say that while in the midst of reading this book...I did not think of those things at all. The pull and chemistry between Christian and Anna was so intense that it was easy to get wrapped up. I love to read but unfortunately don't get to do that much with my full time job, 2 kids and wonderful husband...that did not stop me from finishing this book in 2 days.

B004FGMDOQ|3.0|It started out really interesting. A nice weird &#34;magical realism&#34; sort of story.  I couldn't put it down. Then it turned into Harry Potter, the boring parts of Harry Potter where it is all about battling the evil monsters.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|this is another wonderful true story verifying that their is a heaven and we are all going<br />there eventually.  coming thru the mouth of a little boy that should have not known all these<br />details proves that it is true.  it trully is PROOF.

Gave them to a friend of ours to start watching! If you like Revolution or if you liked Lost....I highly recommend this series! My parents came out for the weekend and watched season 1 with us, they flew back to California and I sent them Season 2 immediately.  Both packages arrived in excellent condition and within a few days after I ordered them.  I received a text message when they were delivered at the door which is great!  You won't be sorry if you decide to take this adventure with the &#34;Walking Dead&#34; :)....Enjoy!!! We have!!!!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I just finished reading the Millennium series (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2008), The Girl Who Played With Fire (2009), The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest (2010)) last night and wanted to comment on it in this public forum...not sure what I can add to understanding of the three books...or the plot or why you should read them, but I'll give it a try. I will highly recommend this series to anyone who wants a wild, entertaining ride into the world of high-suspense crime fiction. The books excel at painting an eerie and foreboding atmosphere. There are flawed likeable characters, memorable villains (you always need them) and enough plot twists and turns to keep everyone on their toes...it is all here and it leaps out at you.<br /><br />I find it fascinating that some of the works of pop culture which I have enjoyed the most in the last year are Hanna (2011) (movie with Saoirse Ronan as a highly-trained assassin), The Hunger Games trilogy, (The Hunger Games (2007), Catching Fire (2009) and Mockingjay (2010) and Millennium series. Interesting that both second books from the Hunger Games trilogy and the Millennium series have fire in their title...Catching Fire (2009) and The Girl Who Played With Fire (2009).<br /><br />All the protagonists in these works are female, fairly young and all defend them self quite well in intellectual, emotional and physical confrontations. Perhaps, I am \\"maled-out\\" (I just made that term up) from viewing and reading about so many male protagonists that I am ready for something completely different. These female characters are fresh, young, bright and have immense appeal.<br /><br />Like many others, I found Lisbeth Salander utterly fascinating. Her diminutive size, gender, attitude and  hacking ability make her someone who I just could not get enough of. When the narrative was about others or other plot lines, I patiently waited (okay, sometimes not so patiently) for the action to go back to Salander, and when it did, my interest was once again peaked. I couldn't wait to find out what she was going to do next. She was, at times, compelling, conflicted, idiosyncratic and complicated..and sometimes she exhibited all of those qualities at one time. I have a feeling that Lisbeth will stay in my mind...and stay.<br /><br />As for this particular book (The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest (2010))...although some have stated in their review that there were too many subplots, I enjoyed the intricate details, the developing storylines and  the many characters that the book provided. That is not to say that I didn't occasionally have to go back to review exactly who a person was and what was their identity/role. I liked the character Suzanne Linder (Erika Berger's bodyguard) and appreciated a bit of her back story. Her character was well drawn out and added to the enjoyment of the book. The online chat with Berger and Salander was intriguing as you felt that each found the exchange a bit uncomfortable, but both seemed to realize that they needed each other. The ongoing dynamic of Berger's new job and her stalker added more suspense, but you always knew that she would end up back at Millennium. And I also loved Dr. Teleborian getting in the end...that bastard had it coming. Who carries their \\"dirty\\" laptop into in a courtroom and gets arrested?.....an arrogant, corrupt pervert, that's who. It was all neatly wrapped up by Stieg Larsson and it all made sense.<br /><br />One of the highlights of the book for me was when Lisbeth entered the courtroom wearing a shirt that said \\"I am Annoyed\\"....did anyone else pick that up?. Honestly, I had to put the book down while I burst out laughing. It all made perfect sense to me.....this girl coming into court with her life on the line, wearing a shirt that basically says...\\"this is a joke, you are a joke and I am put out to even be here\\". Who knew a moment of high drama could contain such humorous irony?<br /><br />I so enjoyed reading this series and stopped at intervals to savor it as the book (and the series) came to a conclusion.....knowing that there would be no more from this author. But, alas, there is a strong indication that Larsson's live-in girlfriend has a fourth story in her possession. Larsson's father and brother have stated in an interview that they saw it, so you never know. Imagine the excitement that a fourth book would create! What would happen next? Perhaps the developing saga of Lisbeth's twin sister Camilla. Is she in trouble or has she too been take advantage in the past? Or could there be another Zalachenko offspring hiding out somewhere with orders to eliminate Lisbeth in the event of Papa Zalachenko's death? What will Lisbeth do with all of her money? What happens to the relationship between Lisbeth and Blomkvist? Does Lisbeth, with the knowledge that so many helped her, change in any way? Is there another tale of Swedish corruption at the highest level of government, business, banking or personal security? I, for one, would get in line to find out.vals to savor it as the book (and the series) came to a conclusion.....knowing that there would be no more from this author.

0812992784|4.0|This is a wonderful history of the author's experiences after being targeted by a fatwa from the Ayatollah Khomeini. It picks up the story at the very beginning of the rise of state sponsored terrorism and stakes out the battle ground between western secular free speech and the Islamic fundamentalism that has come to dominate so much of our world history. The book is filled with quotable snippets of wisdom. My copy is marred with yellow highlighter.  Unfortunately, the author seems hell bent on mentioning every literary celebrity he even spent five minutes with. For me it undermined his courage and determination to continue his literary career under the often oppressive eye of British protective services. The name dropping reaches often absurd proportions, which only raises the role of oversized egos in all of this. Still it is a well written and page turning read. And it outlines the ongoing debate of the free speech vs. this extreme form of censorship, while maintaining sensitivity to the diverse populations, some of whom are more than willing to kill to remain in their cultural bubble.Reads like a thoughful spy thriller for the most part.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Thank you for your business! I received the product in the condition i expected. Very good purchase! Highly recommended seller!
B009O5CLZY|3.0|they should really make it free because some cant buy it but besides that it is a really cool and addicting game one of my favorites to.
B008ENA74E|4.0|Could not put it down. An eye opener on the workings of Wall Street.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to everyone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Everyone in my family loves this game! My 7 yr old saved up his coins to buy the ninja. My 4 year old can make it very far and gets so excited when she gets a prize box. I like that the game changes so you are not running the exact same subway every time.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This app is way better than the other facebook app a little slow someimes but over all pretty good<br /><br /> $$
B004UID2LC|3.0|the app works when u download a video or just as a song but when I go to watch the music video there's a problem. it starts to work but then it gets to the middle of the video and stops working and says error cannot play video. but its only does it for 2 videos I had to delete the others because it showed that at the before the video started. so I think for what I'm saying you would get this app but some videos may not work only the mp3. works very well. were u just get the music and not the video. this is from the kindle fire. problems I don't know about other hand healed items
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I forced myself to get through books 1, & 2 and I am s glad I did because book three helped me to see the grand scheme of it all.  I am not going to ruin the book by telling you what that is, just know that above all the sexy details this trilogy is much greater than the tabooed lifestyle it talks about.  YOU WILL LOVE IT, make sure you read al, three books
0316227706|5.0|Seth has a unique way of capturing our fury friends... Not many of us get to see this side of them.  Most of the photos where hilarious, some a little scary, and others absolutely beautiful!!  This book guarantees to put a huge smile on your face and appreciate our pups all the more.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I got this book on my kindle months after it was released. I told myself I was NEVER going to by this book because I was content with the way I was living.  However, one of my VERY INTELLECTUAL male friends had his nose in this book, and couldn't get it out, I felt the need to find out what was so interesting.<br /><br />I must admit this first book was rather cute, and wasn't a bad read.  It was merely an introduction to the juicy stuff.
B005723JSQ|5.0|This was such fun to read.. and a modern story twist around a cell phone! I love my iphone, and  so enjoyed this story.<br />I laughed out loud more than once....
B007IXWKUK|5.0|So, after reading the first book I wasn't particularly interested in reading the second one. Don't get me wrong the first book wasn't terrible.  After skipping through a few pages of this second boom it got intense, and it challenged the reader to pay attention to the details in order to draw a really get to where the writer wanted to take you.
1451695195|4.0|Great read, it would be hard to discount the story as anything else other than what it is... He truly seems to have experienced Heaven while dead.  I would recommend this book highly above any others that I have read in this genre.  His medical explanations leave little room for argument, and are very authoritative.  If you know a sceptic, this is the book to give them.
B0089LIY7I|4.0|Typically, I don't care for live performances; but this one is quite good. Actually, I like this version of &#34;Dance of The Darkness&#34; better than the studio version.<br /><br />A must have for your Blackmore's Night collection.<br /><br />As for the download... THAT'S IT!!!! This is the LAST time I will ever try to download music from Clod player. (Yes, I spelled it clod, not cloud).
B002HFJ77S|2.0|I did not like this story .. it was weird and creepy. If you like the paranormal you might enjoy, but I didnt like the whole concept of  a ghost following and demanding of another person.  It was so unsettling and the story wandered a bit, I truthfully did not finish.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Revenge is what TV should be. Watch it 1st on TV, then watch it again commercial free to catch details you missed.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|I have become an addict to this show. The season opener is fantastic with<br />Dean wandering the hospital and nobody can see him and communicating through a board game. It is fascinating and creepy all at the same time. Playthings is wonderful and I love how everybody assumes that they are gay and Dean cannot figure out why. It is funny yet not as I had the \\"pleasure\\" of experiencing that assumption with my sister from the mind of somebody else, amazes me what people assume sometimes. Once again you would swear that they are brothers in real life. They have such a chemistry it is amazing to watch. I like the werewolf episode where it turns out that the werewolf is female and Sam sleeps with her and and has to kill her at the end.That would have to be tough to say the least. I think the funnier part of that episode is watching Dean at a strip bar transfixed by the pole dancer right above him. I laughed when he said he had his eyes peeled. Tall Tales is my absolute favorite one of the season. I watched it 3 times just to see them fight and argue like an old married couple and the completely bizarre things that were happening. It is funny beyond belief. The actor who plays the trickster is good even if he looks like a refugee from 1987. I like the Hollywood Babylon episode with the reference to Gilmore Girls(which I never watched). You could see it weird Sam out hearing that. Let alone Dean being the ultimate PA with the actress from the \\"movie\\" they were making. The part of the gag reel referring to that one is all the more hilarious. Finally the Seaon ender. All Hell's Breaking Loose pt 2. It was heartbreaking watching Sam get killed on pt 1 and watching Dean go make a deal with demons to bring Sam back is wrenching to watch. What these 2 brothers will do for one another is a bond all siblings should aspire to. They take it to the extreme, but it is unbreakable no matter how much they fight and argue. They do that very convincingly so that makes you think that theyare related. They are very distinctive in their personalities, Dean being the action taking, gun slinging, hard drinking, womanizing(he loves women, just does not lead a lifestyle that lends to relationships, which is understandable). He is fearless to any outsiders and is not saddled with a whole lot of angst. Sam is the angst ridden and thoughtful really buff book smart brother.Though as the season goes on Sam is developing a harder shell and Jared Padalecki does a fantastic job showng it. He takes his brothers guff and sometimes really does hand it back. I can see that Dean is not easy to render speechless with no smartass comeback. They really do compliment one another and it is a joy to watch. I would give this season 10 stars again if I could. I cannot recommend this series enough.
6305511055|4.0|This is a great classic Redford flick. One might consider this movie the basis for the Bourne series of movies. I bought this on DVD because I consider this to be one of those movie that is &#34;Required Viewing&#34;, however if your under the age of 30 you might not think so, but it is still a great classic suspense thriller type movie.
B001G50QCK|4.0|Just think of the myriad of problems trying to adapt a comic book from the 30s, & making it relevant and entertaining today, well Smallville season 9 tackles those problems and slivers inn spades !  Doomsday, legion of superheroes, loise  lane, all done with superb style & relevance!
B009ETZNIC|5.0|This is how action films should be done. It has some over the top moments, VERY interesting locations, a smart script, and the acting is generally stellar. Mel came back in all the right ways here. It's more like a 4.3 or so but I am still giving it the full 5 here as in the genre it doesn't have many equals coming out these days. Has a studio/indie vibe that works and his relationship with the kid is surprisingly realistic and well toned. Overall this one is a winner so give it a rent. The bluray looks and sounds great to my eyes.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I found his descriptions very interesting and the fact that he was a total scientific non believer having experiences that others had described to him in the past and he had just blown them off. This was his awakening. He relates it very well.
B000B5XOSO|5.0|Well, now that TDKR kind of went off the deep end, we can look back on the Batman films with a keen eye. Burton's first is really dated and generally doesn't hold up well although it is still worth a watch because of the iconic way in which it was made.<br /><br />Begins is a pretty damn good film and is up there with Returns and The Dark Knight. Fans usually cannot decide if they like TDK or BB better. Rises is probably the worst of the bunch just because it could have been something special and ended up being ridiculous by the end of it. Still decent by modern standards. By that time I did feel Bale was really wearing thin with his comical voice and attitude in the role.<br /><br />Back to Returns. This one has by far the most interesting characters of any of the films. Batman and Catwoman in particular are just amazing to watch. Makes Rises' Catwoman look weak in comparison, though I still like Hathaway in the role, not to mention Bale's Batman is great at times as well. But Keaton brought something that was just clearly missing from Bale's version and it is on full display here. I think this one has it all really. Pitch perfect casting, directing, and generally a damn good script. Even coming back to this 15 years later I was surprised at how well it holds up. The sets might be a little smaller than we are used to but other than that they do their best and the film is a masterpiece of the genre still to this day. Perfect pacing.<br /><br />I know a lot of fanboys seem to dislike Burton for whatever reason--I don't really care--but in this film he clearly nailed the aesthetic he set out to, and directed a film with very good cohesion despite its at times barrage of the weird and wondrous. Let's not forget this is all based on a comic book folks. Some of you have been way too influenced by the serious and totally over the top violence of Nolan's films. While that Batman as its place so does this one.<br /><br />Overall, a classic in my book. The score by Elfman is one of the best ever created for film. The performances are top notch and everyone gets screen time. Nearly perfect.The performances are top notch and everyone gets screen time. Nearly perfect.
B003TSDI0E|5.0|It's an amazing and easy way to learn philosophy, with a surprisngly end. I read once when I was a teenager and 20 years after I'd like to read again.
B009VB97EY|3.0|If you're a single woman, then it's great. I watched it with my girlfriend because her [single] friend said she liked it. Both of us thought it was mediocre.
1449433251|5.0|I got the new edition (paperback) and I am VERY happy with it. To start with, since I live in M&eacute;xico, I was expecting it to arrive in about two weeks, but it only took 3 days! It might have something to do with the fact that you can not buy it now since \\"the item is under review\\", if not I don't know what the problem might be but I can assure you I have absolutely none with mine.<br /><br />Luck aside, this is the first complete edition I have ever seen so I can't compare it with the hardcover one, nevertheless I do own a bunch of books and none of them come even close to this edition in terms of quality. The drawings are beautifully printed and the paper is really nice.<br /><br />For a long time Calvin and Hobbes fan this is collection is a most have.<br /><br />One really small complaint is that it seems like someone spilled some liquid on one of the pages, maybe at the factory, I don't know, but it isn't very large, maybe 1.5 inches diameter.
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|with my kindle every single book will be nicer to read :)  The Godfather is a classic and love it.  However i guess the foreword was a bit too long but at the same time super recommendable and interesting for people studying a career related to movies such as movie maker, producer, director, etc.  It is absolutely didactic and entertaining at the same time.
B005ZUR724|5.0|Good one. The quests are fun and challenging. Could use more character classes. Character customization should have a few more options. I would like to see this game get more press so there might be a larger playerbase.
B004UJ81IA|4.0|Nice journal of a long trek through the old southeast French countryside.<br />This book gives you the urge to get a donkey or a horse and follow-up in Stevenson's steps.<br />His account also sets you back in the middle of the bloody and savage war between Calvinists and Catholics in the south of France in the XVIII century.
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|If you loved the movie, the soundtrack just completes the &#34;Pitch Perfect&#34; experience! Totally recommend it :) If you haven't seen the movie the soundtrack is still filled with great music that is both new and old!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|so much fun and addicting!!!looks great on my gs2.hours of fun.only flaw takes forever to get coins back! you will not be disappointed..

B009WO7NQO|1.0|I thought rovio was a good app maker; now its just like any old money hungry company. they've lost all moral values on decent pricing for a happy customer. my advice is to not buy it; and teach rovio a lesson: customers wont stand for ridiculousness.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|I'm new to this so I'll do my best. I like this game because it has good graphics and its just a good game. Bad side if you want good weapons you need glu credits and to get those you need real money.

B009P5S11G|5.0|Rihanna has really step up her game this time. I never thought I would enjoy this album so much. It really blew me away. It's been on repeat since! It's never been like that with Talk That or even Loud. I do love Loud though.  It sonically takes me back to Talk That Talk and Rated R, but it's a much improvement from Talk That Talk. Feels personal as Rated R but I feel that it makes up what Rated R was lacking. It is much more cohesive and consistent than Rated R. If Rated R didn't have weak tracks like Photographs, Stupid in Love, Cold Case Love, and The Last Song, it would have gotten me. It definitely feels like her most cohesive one so far since GGGB. The productions feels so well put together. I don't even feel like skipping the songs on this one this time. Who knows? It may even top GGGB on my ranking. I can actually listen to it straight thru and that says alot! She's even more hands on this time with the songwriting and producing. I am really impressed. This album really deserves to be #1. Not many people will agree with me. They think it's sounds too urban and \\"hood\\". I actually like \\"Hoodanna\\". She just has this swag that makes me want to enjoy listening to what she's saying. Her lyrical flow is so good that her rapping skills almost seems incredible. I got Lotus as well. It got some good tracks, but wasn't too fascinated overall. However, this one kinda makes up for the disappointment I was feeling. This is my first Rihanna cd EVER! I am seriously in love with this era that I feel like getting the standard edition as well!<br /><br />1. Phresh Out The Runaway (5/5)-perfect track to start out to. She sounds so fierce and angry. She points out people find inconsistencies with her image. \\"How can you be so pop and then sound like you're from the hood\\". The beats are just smashing!<br /><br />2. Diamonds (4/5) -beautiful song. It's not as redundant as \\"We Found Love\\", but I just wasn't feeling the vocals during the chorus.<br /><br />3. Numb (5/5)- I love this collaboration with Eminem. Never really cared for Love The Way You Lie.<br /><br />4. Pour It Up (5/5)-Haven't seen this side of her since Rated R. She boast about her fame and fortune. Might turn some people off, but I like the double standards here. Many male rappers would make songs bragging about money and fame, but hardly female pop stars ever do that. Props to Rihanna.<br /><br />5. Loveee Song (5/5) -Some people would feel that Future ruin the song by sounding so drunk and tired, but I really like that for some reason. I guess it brings humor to the song.<br /><br />6. Jump (5/5)- this song and the Pony sample....just so amazing!<br /><br />7. Right Now (5/5)-it's very generic sounding and just a typical club dance song, but I could see this doing well as a single. It would be like \\"We Found Love\\" all over again. The \\"zoom\\", \\"bong\\", and \\"ping\\" sounds were really cool. Not too redundant as We Found Love. I prefer this over We Found Love.<br /><br />8. What Now (5/5)- oh my goodness..when has Rihanna ever sound this AMAZING? she has totally blew me away with his one. Her vocals have never sound so better and so on point. By far, my favorite ballad so far! great job! Should release this as a single.<br /><br />9. Stay (5/5)- a very beautiful ballad. Far different from the ones she had done in the past.<br /><br />10. Nobody's Business (5/5)- I was expecting another birthday cake remix, but what i got instead is this funky, old school tune that makes me want to bust the dancefloor. It gives me MJ/Whitney teas.  Riri and Chris have that special chemistry like no other. They are telling people that they are going to live the life that they want to and no one else can do anything about that! you tell them, Chrihanna!<br /><br />11. Love Without Tragedy/Mother Mary (5/5)- omg...this is the BEST ever! some say it's like Cold Case Love, but this is MILES better than that song. Never got the hype over that song. It's bland at best! This song actually GIVES life!<br /><br />12. Get It Over With (4/5)-love the beautiful melody. very sensual, but felt like it needed something more to it. It will grow on you the more you listen to it.<br /><br />13. No Love Allowed (4/5)- it sounds really good, but Man Down is better.<br /><br />14. Lost In Paradise (4.5/5)-fun track...almost gives me GGGB teas.<br /><br />15. Half Of Me (5/5)-amazing track along with the remixes. definitely worth getting the deluxe!<br /><br />Average rating: 4.76br />12.

B003XDZLTG|5.0|These crocs are wonderful.  I am a half-size, but my 1st crocs were given to me by a guy.  He washed them and they shrank to my size, 9.5.  Tried ordering the 9's but they were not comfortable on my age-battered feet because my big toes just touched.  Having had a bunion, I got a 10.  Put them in hot water, then the dryer.  Forgot they were drying, but they came out at about a 9 1/2.  One seems a smmidge smaller, but it could just be my foot (its had some problems recently).  I wore them around today again and have worn them out once.  I also wrap a ribbon over my foot and back thru the back strap for an extra strap.  Bought the black, using a pale peach ribbon.  Bought the black because that was the color that shrank before.  These shoes are very ventilated and cool, also. Wore with thick tube knee-high socks last night and the left one stretched to \\"perfect\\".  So happy to get this free & easy shoe that feel good on the tired \\"dogs\\".  They're real cute, too.  Plan to order some of the crocs boots next.

B004HO6I4W|5.0|My husband first taped this on the DVR, then we had to purchase it.  My granddaughters (16 mon & 3y) just LOVE this movie - the little one says \\"Rio Rio\\" as soon as she walks in our house!  The sound track is something you want to get up and dance to as well.  We all dance together when we watch this.  The movie has a good message, funny scenes and very colorful.  Defiantly recommend and you will recognize the voices (Anne Hathaway, George Lopez,...)
B00992CF6W|3.0|you can bulid really cool things .In minecraft I play it sowe much. I watch cool youtube videos about minecraft.

Unbelievable.<br /><br />If you put it on sale tomorrow I won't be upset.  I wanted it today.

0316228532|4.0|There are two camps when it comes to The Casual Vacancy. The first camp finds the book slow and very dull. These people might be the ones that are angry that this book isn't related to the world of Harry Potter. The second camp love the book and find it fascinating. These might be the people that will read anything that J.K. Rowling writes just because she's J.K. Rowling.<br /><br />I don't belong to either of these camps, but I loved the book anyway. First of all, as a general warning, this book is character-driven, not plot-driven. There are a lot of characters that are introduced, but I didn't find it hard to keep track of them. In the story, nothing really happens. The characters all just react to the death and the book describes the complexity of life while a community is coping with loss. It's a bleak book. Everything is tinted with a feeling of hopelessness and depression and most people are unhappy. Basically, Rowling wrote about life in small-town England and she made no apologies for how honest it is. There are elements of casual sex, rape, drug use, and self-harm in this book and copious amounts of swearing to go along with it. It's by no means pretty, but it's resounding in its sincerity.<br /><br />To sum up, if you like to read books as an escape from everyday life, this book may not be for you. It's not light-hearted, it won't make you smile. However, if you like a dose of reality in your books and you're interested in the complexities of people, then pick it up. Rowling proves she's an incredible writer and her career as an author isn't over just because Harry Potter is.
0307474275|1.0|\\"The DaVinci Code\\" undoubtedly deserves its place high on the list of the worst books ever written. Its short chapters insult the intelligence of the reader much like the work (I shudder to use the word) of James Patterson. Clunky dialogue, poorly realized characters, and shoddy research undermine whatever effect the author was attempting to produce. I believe that this book was aggressively promoted into best-sellerdom and then the lemming phenomenon took over. I read it because a friend raved about it, and I watched the DVD later, hoping that it might be an improvement. I was sorely disappointed on all accounts. The most aggravating feature of this book is that the author wasted a golden opportunity to undermine Christianity, but instead undermined his own credibility with the phony research and stilted writing. If you want to read a book that seriously exposes the inadequacies of Christianity, try \\"Misquoting Jesus,\\" by Bart Ehrman. He's a scholar, but his book is accessible to the average reader.
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|its good but it only give u 15 mins. and u also have tostart over and after u make like 10 worlds u have to buy the 3.99 one
B002MQYOFW|2.0|Compared to other dystopias, such as 1984, Animal Farm, Brave New World, Lord of the Flies, or Fahrenheit 451, The Hunger Games is mediocre at best. I saw the film first and was underwhelmed, so I read the book to see if that was an appropriate response on my part. The novel is only marginally better, providing more details and a deeper character study of the heroine, Katniss Everdeen. The other characters in the novel were sketchy, in my opinion, but I awarded two stars for the depiction of the tenacious Everdeen. As for her two love interests, there is insufficient chemistry to create interest on the part of the reader. The most interesting part of the novel for me was the preparation for the games. The games themselves were anticlimactic, lacking in suspense, and even ho-hum at times. The most egregious flaw in the novel is the depiction of the futuristic society--or should I say lack of depiction. It doesn't come alive for me and I can find little satirical intent other than a skewering of reality tv shows. There is evidence that the society has advanced technology, but as to the people who live in it or run it, they are amorphous to the point of almost lacking identity. In the final analysis, the novel seems to be nothing more than an excuse to set a group of teenagers at one another's throats, periodically throwing obstacles in their path.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I cant even install it so does anyone have the same problem?but ive played it on my friends tablet and its great!
0307949486|5.0|\\"The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo\\" is a complexly plotted Swedish procedural--I recommend that you read the author bio on Wikipedia, which will provide some useful insight into the novel's subject matter. This mystery is compulsively readable, particularly because of the two protagonists, a middle-aged, male Swedish journalist and a twenty-something female private investigator. He has just been convicted of libel, and she has been abused by men during her short life. A series of bizarre events bring them together to investigate a decades old murder within a dysfunctional family. The writing provides insight into European capitalism, male/female relationships, investigative techniques, moral and ethical ambiguities, and contemporary Swedish culture.
0316056863|5.0|I wish I could give this book more stars. It was hilarious, I found myself lauging out loud throughout the book and then rereading many parts to a few friends. Tina Fey really has came a long ways and she shows us that it's great to laugh at your mistakes and bad experiences, they are inevitable. I admire her ambition she has had through life that got her where she is today.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|This was a good book mainly because of the familiar characters but the ending was too abrupt. It was good to see that Kay & Wesley had problems in their marriage and that Lucy had probably found a healthy relationship at last. However, there wasn't enough about Lucy in this book. Kay is getting too passive, but the psychological aspects between characters is very interesting. Overall, a good read.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a really fun game so far. Some of the games are challenging, but that's what makes it so fun! I haven't gotten to the update yet, so I can't say anything about that, but this game is really fun in my opinion right now.

B004PKOKSO|4.0|I'm not a hardcore Scofield fan but I did buy the CD so I think I'm still allowed to write a review here. Scofield fans will just have to forgive me. I know he says above that he didn't want this to be easy listening but it could have been one of the best chill-out, guitar CDs ever if it wasn't for the \\"Scofield sound\\". I know, I know... What do I expect if I buy a Scofield CD? I love his playing, it's just a shame that he doesn't play with a cleaner sound. And don't you hate it when an otherwise brilliant CD is made unplayable (unless you want to press skip all the time) because of one bad song? Track 10 is that song. The rest of the CD gets 4 stars because it is, as I say, otherwise a brilliant CD.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I liked it ok but I dont think these books are better than The Grey Trilogy. Of course, I still have the last one of this to read but I was on the edge of each page with all the Grey books. These are just not as much as a page turner for me.

B00913DPW2|4.0|I liked a lot of this game.  I think I got quite far before consulting the walkthrough.  I will the moths for the rest and see what difference there is.<br />One huge complaint I have is with the mini-puzzles resetting if you leave the game before completing them.  The toy box one is in three parts.  If you leave to take a break before finishing all three parts, when you return all three parts are reset.  Big fail!  This is not the only mini-puzzle I had this trouble with.  The slide-puzzle would reset (not all of them like the box one) but still.  Also,  I woild have been happy with only one of those ones--having three almost madr me quit the game.<br />I haven't looked to see if this option exist, but would really like an option to bypass a puzzle if I got too discouraged/bored with it.<br />Other than those complaints I really enjoyed this game--A LOT!  (so far) .<br /><br />cheers!

B009AMANBA|5.0|This superb motion picture focuses on the intense political maneuvering and bargaining during January 1865 that led to the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment in the House of Representatives.  While many of us may have considered the Emancipation Proclamation (published after the Union victory at Antietam in September 1862 and effective on January 1, 1863) to be the event that \\"freed the slaves\\" and for which Abraham Lincoln has been considered our greatest president, the actual outlawing of Slavery throughout the United States did not come until the 13th Amendment to the Constitution was passed in both houses of Congress and formally ratified by the States at the end of 1865.  The legal necessity for this Amendment is carefully and clearly explained during this movie and gives gravity to this immensely important legislative activity.<br /><br />This is not a sweeping biographical study of Lincoln nor even the depiction of his entire presidency as was the dramatization of Gore Vidal's LINCOLN (1988) so ably performed by Sam Waterson and Mary Tyler Moore.  It is, rather, an intense focus on one set of events near the end of Lincoln's life and presidency that captures with greater clarity and precision the essential greatness of the man and enormous implications of the political debates facing the Congress at the time.<br /><br />Daniel Day Lewis gives what is certainly the single best interpretation of Lincoln I have ever seen, but the supporting cast is also extremely effective.  Tommy Lee Jones (as Congressman Thaddeus Stevens), Bruce McGill (as the irritable and blustery Secretary of War Stanton) and Sally Field (the acute, but deeply disturbed Mary Todd Lincoln), all render memorable performances.  The human toll of war are also presented without resorting to such faux battle re-enactments as were presented in the 1988 TV movie.  Wagons of severed limbs and mangled bodies portray the carnage in this film without resorting to inadequate action sequences.<br /><br />This will undoubtedly be a prime Oscar contender for 2012 and probably be numbered among the great motion pictures of all time./>This will undoubtedly be a prime Oscar contender for 2012 and probably be numbered among the great motion pictures of all time.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Long ago I read the four hour work week, which can be summarized as 'don't work for a living, instead earn a living telling others in great detail how THEY don't have to work for a living.' I found that book useless.<br />However, I came upon this book and started researching it not even realizing it was written by Ferriss. Well, for $5 I bought the kindle edition.. Maybe I am different, or Ferriss is different, or both, but I actually appreciate the information in this book. Quite a lot, in fact. Specifically it was how he studied and learned Japanese which was the tipping point for me (I'm doing the same painful thing now).<br />I was spring loaded to hate this book, but I like it. And I recommend it to anyone who is on the fence about buying it.

B007JM4CWY|5.0|Love playing this game.  Very addictive - my goto when i want to really zone out.  Updates regularly so you dont run out of new puzzles.  Would be nice if there was a 'revert' option so you could go back to a previously saved puzzle when you really mess up!  I use 'undo' A LOT!  ;)  I got it free as FAOTD, but I would buy this game.

B009329ZF2|4.0|I thought this movie was very entertaining for an extensive thrill ride conceptish way.  Story was supported well and suspense of what was about to happen really had me on the edge.  Good movie for a Saturday or Sunday Night Watch like a movie night at home.

B008458O3S|5.0|This is the first time I have ever reviewed an App and it is because this game is so well done! It is a slow-paced puzzle game so you have to rate it for what it is. The strategy is unique and each puzzle is well thought out. It has a good progression and the tutorial is spot on. I didn't have to pay for the App, but if I had, I certainly would have paid more than they are asking. Definitely going to check out more Noodle Cake games.
B000NA28I4|1.0|This book was a great book. I read the book after I saw the movie. Now I hate the movie. They didn't seem to get the characters right. Murtagh is my favorite character, even though they stuck to the book with him it seemed ike they didn't follow his character traits. He was in the book a lot more than they showed in the movie. Arya was another one of the important characters and they didn't even follow her right. Not to mention Brom's death. I found myself disappointed when they didn't follow the book with his death. Not to mention all of the things they didn't cover that they should have! Where Eragon got Saphira's name, and where Eragon's name came from. I can expect some changes in movie's that they didn't follow in the book, but that much? I think they should have gotten a better director for the movie who would follow the book. I would not recomend the movie to anyone who hasn't read the book. In fact I wouldn't even recomend the movie. It was a waste of money, and time.
B0053O89KG|5.0|I enjoyed this season as much as I have enjoyed the other seasons.  I like having full seasons of shows that I like and this is one of the shows I like.  I am not into watching things on computer and I have yet to make the decision to change everything to Blue ray so having it on DVD is great for me.
B001JU4S44|2.0|Script needed a rewrite! Worst of the 4 movies 1 and 3 were the best, and number 4 was good but not has dark as 1 and 3 were. This movie was far worse than expected- the script needed a huge rewrite- a few things were off in the movie, does not seem to flow well and seems choppy in regards to the unfolding of the story.
B007R41E8O|5.0|This is a great game with great graphics.  The storyline is good, as well.  It did take about 10 minutes todownload but well worth it.
B005DNO7MQ|5.0|This movie script is remarkability well written and the execution of the idea from script to movie is done very well- this movie is a classic- up there with Star Wars and Alien period.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|One of the best books ever written about special forces. I've now read it 3 times. This book is a must read.

0385536828|3.0|Serena Frome is not the best employee M15 ever had, nor does she make for a great character in a novel, especially as she plays a spy. Her shortcomings are all laid out in a letter her unwitting boyfriend writes at the end of the novel. That letter is the best part of the book, and if the rest of the novel were written with the same gusto, this could have been an incredibly interesting novel. But perhaps it had to be a bore in order to give such life to that letter. So, I was glad that I read all the way through, as it finally earned my interest. Just not another star.

B00846REIS|5.0|I can't wait to finish all three books. The only drawback is if you aren't the type of person who curses or doesn't enjoy profanity this book isn't for you. The characters are relatable, we are all messed up in our own ways, and we need to make our relationships work. I can't wait to finish the next book.

0486295559|5.0|The characters and emotions in this book are some of Jane Austen's finest works, and I adore this book. I also adore Anne. All the better that I can now picture Rupert as Captain Wentworth whilst I read (I picture my own Anne, however). Oh, when she first sees him look at her like he used to! And, oh, his letter! Just remembering makes me hanker for another re-read! Just so lovely and emotional.<br /><br />If you love romance, this is one of the very best (although I now know to skip the visit to Mrs Smith, at the end, as I don't think it adds anything to the plot).
B005PK553C|5.0|This was a very good show. I could not find any where else online able to watch it for a decent price.
B000Z27HLS|5.0|Catherine is an imaginative, naive and friendly girl who is utterly adorable. She acts all of her teenage years in a relatable way, not an annoying way. I LOVE that she has little fantasies about men, as some teens do, and so tells her mature friend, \\"I do not think I am very pure-of-heart: I have the most terrible dreams sometimes!\\" and her friend just smiles to herself (if that is the worst thing Catherine does, she is indeed pure).<br /><br />And Mr. Tilney...! Such a gentle and humorous personality, whilst still remaining strong and competent. Say what you will about Mr. Darcy, with all his brooding goodness, but I would rather this personable hero who can hold an interesting conversation and easily forgive being slighted.<br /><br />The scene where he wipes a splatter of mud from her cheek is so tender and romantic that I get butterflies nearly every time.<br /><br />All the characters have their own personality without being over the top or distracting. They're realistic (although Miss Thorpe is so very...)<br /><br />This movie is about the prettiest movie ever. If I put it on to do the ironing, I end up drinking in the TV screen every time. Hairstyles change when scenes change (at last!) and the dresses and hats are the most lovely of any other Austen film. The most I can liken the visual prettiness to is \\"Emma\\" (Gwyneth Paltrow version).<br /><br />I enjoy there being no great conflict in this movie; it makes it such a delight to re-watch time and again when I'm not wanting anything heavy or dark. The only thing that being light on the angst means is that it's also light on the feelings and depth of love. This is only a slight qualm. My two main qualms are...<br /><br />2. the annoying little brat... ah, girl (Lucy) who chastises her big sister for no reasons. EG, when Catherine is only laying under a tree: \\"Cathy! What're you DOING?!\\" etc. GRRR)<br /><br />3. The casting MISTAKE of Mr. Thorpe. Why have the villain so OBVIOUSLY the villain = ugly? I WISH film-makers would let us see that it's what is INSIDE the man that makes him, not if he's the best looking. It makes the heroine seem shallow. Yeah, I want the hero to be eye-candy, but the red-herring-hero should be at least the SECOND best looking man! After Pride and Prejudice miniseries got this SOOOOOO wrong with ugly-Whickham actor--who was supposed to be handsome--I'm super sensitive to this crutch being used in fiction.<br /><br />I recommend Northanger Abbey as much as I do the Pride and Prejudice miniseries. Now that is high praise indeed.lm-makers would let us see that it's what is INSIDE the man that makes him, not if he's the best looking. It makes the heroine seem shallow.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|I was anxious to read this book considering the first book I read in a few days.  This book did not disappoint either.  I couldn't put it down.  The story line is deeper, their relationship is deeper, and keeps you thinking the whole time.  The best part was at the end when Sylvia Day tells you there is a 3rd book.  June can not come soon enough!

B007FG9LIE|4.0|This was my first time reading Crouch and I was definitely impressed with his imagination and description.  Kept me reading and eager for answers which were all summed up in a riveting final chapter that I did not see coming. As a fan of King and Koontz I loved the creepy parts.<br /><br />Very well plotted and written, making me care for the protagonist and other characters and detest others. That's what a great novel should do. I will definitely try other works by Crouch.  Only reason I gave this 4 stars and not 5 was because of some flaws with realism in the final chapters. Don't want to spoil anything for anyone, the book was excellent just a few bones to pick with certain explanations given. Otherwise, awesome read.

1609611543|5.0|I can't improve upon the excellent reviews here, but just want to add that I love some of the recipes at the end of the book. I've been trying to eat wheat-free, but my diet tends to be quite dull. The \\"Flaxseed Wraps\\" have quickly become a staple in my life. They are absolutely delicious, quick and easy to make, and can be filled with just about anything. They would probably taste great filled with dirt. The \\"Apple Walnut Bread\\" is also scrumptious, even if a bit too crumbly.<br />Also has good suggestions for snacks, spreads, etc.<br />Great book!
B004Q7CIFI|4.0|Typically enjoyable Steven King - with some provocative ideas in there. Would stopping the greatest assassination in American history change this for the better? Or...  The story dragged a bit at times (at some point you just want to find out if he can do it or not, and then what the outcome will be if he does), but overall an interesting concept well executed.
0446615625|5.0|I am a huge Baldacci fan and this is long overdue. I loved this entire collection and following Oliver Stone. Bravo! Baldacci captures your attention and keeps you wanting more. (It's entertainment! I don't get all wrapped up in whether it's possible or not. WITH modern day politics and the lies and betrayal in government anything is possible!)  I cannot wait until someone in Hollywood (maybe DreamWorks) turns this into a blockbuster hit. If they do it right this will win several academy awards. I listened to the Audio Book CDs (highly recommend unabridged) envisioning what actors would star as the lead role. No doubt Daniel Day Lewis should play Oliver Stone. Secret Service Agent Alex Ford should be played by Christian Bale. If Kevin Spacey plays Caleb he will win the role of Best Supporting Actor. He would be perfect. Annabelle Conroy should be played by Charlie Theron. They would need to make him look much older, but Cillian Murphy would be great as Harry Finn. Oliver Stone's former colleague in power, who believes he is dead and wants to make sure of this, could be played by Ralph Fiennes. BUT to stun the audience Daniel Craig would shine in the role. We are not use to seeing him as a villan. And Leonardo Dicaprio would need to put weight on, but he needs to play Jerry Bagger. Get ready for the ride - high energy, intrigue, and you are cheering for Oliver Stone. And so hoping, even though this is fiction, that there are still real Heroes out there..
B000NQRR1Q|4.0|I still love this movie simply because it is a Johnny Depp movie and he is my absolutely favorite. But, I thought that it could've been much better. It got my interest but by the end of the movie I wasn't nearly as into it and the ending doesn't make a whole heck of a lot of sense, I felt like there were a lot of questions unanswered. If you're a true Johnny fan or just like odd movies then it's worth owning simply for that but otherwise I don't know that I would recommend this to someone.
B00125JP1C|4.0|This movie is awful. My friend showed me a couple of scenes from it, and it was so over-the-top, I immediately sought it out and bought it. I was not dissappointed- this movie is just so bad, defies logic so well, it's truly entertaining.
0316187216|5.0|Red Country is Abercrombie's third stand-alone novel set in the same world as his First Law trilogy.  While reading the prior books is not necessary to follow the story, I think it really enhances the experience, as there are many plot points and characters that are easier to understand if you know the backstory.<br /><br />The book revolves are Shy South, a woman with a troubled past who is trying to keep the family farm running.  When the farm is burned and her brother and sister are kidnapped she vows to track down the attackers and get her siblings back.  In order to do so she will need to chase them across the Far Country, an unsettled, brutal land in the midst of a gold rush.  Her father-in-law Lamb, who she believes to be the biggest coward alive, accompanies her due to a promise he made to her mother.<br /><br />The story sounds simple, but as it continues it keeps adding more and more to the mix.  Along the way they find interesting characters to accompany them, join up with a group of settlers heading towards the rumors of gold, get embroiled in the battle for the town where the gold rush is centered, and finally get sucked into the politics of the brewing war between the Union and the Old Empire.  Some familiar faces from previous books play a role, Cosca, Friendly, and Caul Shivers just to name a few.  Consistent with the previous books there are really no cut and dry good guys, it's a dark and dirty world and even the \\"heroes\\" aren't going to come out clean.<br /><br />The highlight for me is Lamb.  I won't spoil who he is, but if you've read any of the previous books you probably already know.  If this series is Abercrombie's take on a western movie, the Lamb is Clint Eastwood's character from The Unforgiven (which I would swear there are some lines from in the book, not the same, but close enough that it made me wonder if it was intentional..... or I could just be reading too much into it).  Lamb is the killer who has tried to put the violent past behind him and start fresh, slowly getting dragged back into the old life.  This has always been among my favorite characters in the series, and it's a welcome return, even if the character might wish differently.<br /><br />In conclusion, simply stated, this is my favorite fantasy novel I've read this year, best I've read since the previous book in the series.  It manages to tell a great story on its own while continuing to develop the storylines in Abercrombie's world.  Highly recommended!

B000HKYBXA|3.0|Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet goes from the sublime to the ridiculous with virtually every scene.<br /><br />Despite his great love of working with non-Shakespearean actors, he is not a good director of actors.  So someone like Jack Lemmon, who is a good actor but may not have much experience with Shakespeare, comes across looking very amateurish.  He casts people in the incidental roles that are not the appropriate age, which really affects the interpretation of the play.  Hamlet is a young man's play, pitting the younger generation against the older generation, and some of that is lost when you don't cast the actors around Hamlet in the same age range. Kate Winslett, is inappropriately cast as Ophelia.  (No woman at that time would have been 25 and unmarried!)<br /><br />In terms of filming, the scenes with the ghost of Hamlet, Sr. come across as way over the top.  At the time of the release, I compared the ghost, who speaks through the statue, to the Stay Puff Marshmallow Man in Ghostbusters.  The \\"How All Occasions\\" soliloquy with its broad camera shots and backdrop comes across rather silly-looking and really undermines the seriousness of the soliloquy. The sex scenes with Kate Winslett are inappropriate to the play, despite the updated time frame and are, I believe, just an attempt to appease audiences used to sex and violence.  Also, the ending is a bit more Die Hard than Hamlet.  Parts of the final sword fight scene are somewhat absurd and over the top.  Only in action movie would the ending be believable.<br /><br />Now, on the positive side, with the full text of Shakespeare's Hamlet, you get the Fortinbras plot, which does add a layer to the young man's theme of the play and Fortinbras provides a great contrast to Hamlet, as well as to the well-being of the entire monarchical/political structure of Denmark.  Branagh is stunning in the quieter moments of the soliloquies in particular and of the overall performance in general.  Julie Christie and Derek Jacobi are brilliant as Claudius and Gertrude.  They play the two of them as if they both might be in on the murder of Hamlet, Sr.  The actor who plays Laertes gets across the similarities between himself and his father, Polonius, which I had never thought about before.  Branagh plays a very angry Hamlet, which is distinctly different that the \\"melancholy Dane\\" that we usually see, and I think this interpretation works well.  After all, he has had the throne usurped from him, so he has a personal investment in what happens as well.<br /><br />It's definitely worth seeing, but it is a rollercoaster ride!e brilliant as Claudius and Gertrude.

B002WTOXUK|1.0|I was really looking forward to this movie and when I saw all these good reviews I was even more exciting. Then I played the movie ....... There are not many movies that I can't finish watching, but this was gone of them. I couldn't turn it off fast enough and I've sad through some pretty terrible movies. It actually made me crabby after seeing it because I just hated it so much. Not because of blood, violence, swearing, etc .... It was just so annoying. I want to buy a dvd of this movie just so I can spend time kicking it and burning it with fire. I haven't been this disappointed in a film since I heard they were making a new Robin Hood movie, only to see a trailer for what looked like Gladiator part 2: Welcome to the woods. I'm going to go watch Troll Hunter again and try to forget about this movie.
B007V65R54|5.0|A wonderful book about an important subject. I was educated on almost every page.  The roles of honest error, uncertainty, noise and barefaced bias in the prediction business were most enlightening. Every politician and economist should read if before making any further profound preditions.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|This was an excellent recounting of World War II told in historical novel format. There were many details about the Russian movement into East Germany that were previously unknown to me, and which helped me to understand some of the subsequent causes of the cold war and the building of the Berlin wall. The known bombing of civilians by both sides during the combat was kept from public knowledge both in England and in Germany, which did not surprise me.  However, the propagandized hatred of Germans by the Russian government was eye opening. I higly recommend this book as well as Ken Follet's preceding novel, describing World War I, in The Fall of Giants.

B009KHDT0C|2.0|Not what I expected. Was cheesy and lame. One of the few bad Depp movies I have seen (maybe the only bad one). Just over the top, the teen girls secret was just to cheesy. Wanted it to be much better. Failed to meet expectations.

B009NPKTN6|4.0|Must say I laughed a bunch, and loved some of the tunes. I was shocked to find that all of the songs are performed by the actors. I do not like Tom cruise, but have to say he was very good in this movie and at singing (it hurts to admit that I was impressed). The nostalgia and 80's stuff was so powerful since my wife and I lived a little of those stories. Loved the fact that Kevin Nash was one of the bodygaurds.
B000UAFDP2|4.0|As a B-Movie SciFi Fan...this is a classic.....the HD version is so much better then the original so they did a great job upgrading it....BUT make sure you get a non-bootleg copy....if you want to know how to tell....got to ASK and look up ratings....All bootlegs are REGION FREE and neither Amazon, eBay or others will ban them from sale....so buyer beware if there is no Regional rating.....

B0098VXBIA|3.0|Cliche', but that was the point I guess. Sad commentary on todays parenting. The Adoption angle was cool. Chris Rocks kid being neglected and abused, as comic relief was kinda disturbing. Self absorbed people being self absorbed. Just not very entertaining. Could have not seen it and I would not have missed anything.
0061339202|5.0|I really can't adequately express how great \\"Flow\\" is.  Many of my own disconnected introspective ideas and life experiences were drawn into a greater, more meaningful picture as I read this book, like (pardon the cliche) puzzle pieces fitting together.  \\"Flow\\" manages to be a rare combination of inspiring, enlightening, and calming.  It is not an exaggeration to say that this book will affect the way I live my life.
B0045XICB2|2.0|The acting is stilted, over the top. The story is lame and over dramatic. Bella is just dumb, and makes bad decisions, everyone is selfcentered and selfish (todays culter at least is reflected here). Cheesey when it is not trying to be. WAY,WAY, WAY, over hyped. Lameness at a major level. I would not have even checked it out if it was not for someone making me watch it with them.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|A really well done production that keeps me waiting for the next show. I read the books and now I get to watch the action. Super.
B0054SMID0|5.0|Just plain great. Solid, cool, slick, deep, dramatic in a good way. Did not expect this movie to be as good as it was. Very plesant surprise. Must see, for those that like good movies.

B005ZCXPP0|4.0|Liked it. It was entertaining and worth paying to see at the theater, so a rental is totaly worth it.
B0013K1ALE|4.0|Alot of people complain about the cheesy fantasy sequences in the \\"Song Remains the Same.\\"  There is a reason for that.  I just finished reading the book \\"Night and Shade\\"  a book of interviews with Jimmy Page and others.  In the book, Mr. Page goes into detail about the making of the film.  Apparently they fired the first director of the movie.  There was much footage lost during the making of the film.  The finished product had a lot of gaps in it.  So, the band decided to fill in the gaps with those fantasy sequences which were done years later.  Another interesting tidbit:  They had to redo some of the songs on a sound stage.  Jimmy Page said he had a little difficulty synching up to his own stuff.  I think only a guitarist would notice that some of the songs aren't quite sync'd up.  I remember seeing this movie when it first came out in the theaters.  After that, I would dream about being a rock star like Jimmy Page!
B002O5M4SA|5.0|It is very simple: if you leave in the parts that were censored from the theatrical version, the story is completely different. I am very happy I saw it complete. The story as intended is much more solid, more cohesive.
B004UID2LC|4.0|This is a great app! I love how you can listen to music even when you don't have wifi.. But I don't know how the shuffle works sometimes it does and sometiimes it doesn't. Also I always have the same picture for every song and it doesn't change.. Please fix!(:
B0095T3H2U|2.0|I thought this movie was okay. It could have been a lot better, but the acting was a little stiff and failed to draw me into the storyline. There were a few scenes that did make me giggle though. All in all, I give it 2 stars. While it wasn't the best and most entertaining movie that I've watched recently, it was okay for a night with nothing to do.
1439152802|5.0|I found this book most intriguing.  Switching from the 1940s to 2011 was great.  However, each time frame left you with a mystery, a question, a need to find out what happened next.  I found myself reading quickly to get back to the 40's.  I loved her earlier books but think this one was the best to date.  I loved all the characters and worried about what was going to happen next.  An unpredictable twist at the end.<br /><br />I am delighted to fall in love with an author who is current so I can expect another book from her in a year or more.<br />Please Kate keep writing.<br />Every one of your books are a treasure.<br />Thank you.
B006H5120E|2.0|Ok, we all know about the story--loved it.  My review is on the 3D version and I am really disappointed. Does it make a difference that the movie wasn't originally shot for 3D? I'm no expert at the art of 3D,  but my whole family felt the same way--blah. There was added depth to certain scenes, but the majority of it seemed like normal 2D to me. I even tweaked some of the 3D settings, still blah. Maybe it looked better at the theater, but this was a total waste of money.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was highly recommended to me by a relative. While it is clearly a young adult book, and I am an adult, I enjoyed most of it and looked forward to reading it until it was finished. The most important thing is it made me laugh, cry, and think about life and death in a very good way. I will pass this on to my 15 year old, and never forget the characters in the book.
B00A31UXLW|5.0|After so many Harry Bosch stories you would think they should start to run out of steam - IMHO this is not so. Michael Connelly is a consummate author who can keep a great character running and evolving and continue to produce a top-class page-turning police procedural.<br /><br />In the last book, after a short retirement Harry Bosch returned to the LAPD with  a 5 year contract under the Deferred Retirement Option Plan - \\"The DROP\\".  He now works with the Open Unsolved Unit chasing up cold cases. In 1999, at the height of the LA Riots, Bosch briefly gets involved with the discovery of the gunshot death of  a pretty female free-lance Danish press photographer who was apparently killed as part of the riot.  This case had always troubled Bosch and he gladly accepts the challenge although after all that time the trail has gone cold.<br /><br />Bosch is an impatient detective - to him momentum is everything. Once he is on the trail he is a bloodhound who never lets up until he finds a break. He calls this \\"The Black Box\\" because, similar to air crash investigation a single verified clue may open up the whole case. After diligent and clever police work Bosch finds his Black Box and discovers a web of intrigue and violence going back to the first Gulf War.<br /><br />Working the case in his normal independent manner is not helped by his a strained relationship with and lack of respect for the competence of his superiors at LAPD, especially his current Lieutenant (O'Toole - nickname \\"O'Fool\\").  \\"You are the worst kind of police officer, Bosch. You are arrogant, a bully, and you think the laws and regulations don't apply to you.\\" O'Toole refers Bosch to Internal Affairs on what seems to be a petty matter, but it is important because it affects the way Bosch can run the investigation and if the complaint is upheld he could easily lose his job because he is on a DROP contract.<br /><br />Connelly keeps up the pressure and spins an exciting tale of skilled police investigation by a dedicated, independent but somewhat personally flawed Harry Bosch. I recommend this book as a great read for lovers of police procedurals and a good Christmas present for those who still read print books.by a dedicated, independent but somewhat personally flawed Harry Bosch.

B00A77II0U|1.0|What has the world come to?  people are always on their doohicky divices...This game is inappropriate and creepy. How do children get fun out of this game? I don't like it one bit. Plus its 3$....what?!! why would you want to pay 3$ for this! Its just plan scary. Back when I was a kid us kids would have a blast with just a rock and a stick. Now all u kids are always texting with your iphones. I don't even have a cell phone I'm using my grandchilds phone to write this reveiw. I guess I'm just getting old. Back to the what you call &quot;app&quot; whatver that means. Don't get it. Unless you are a troubled child like all the rest.
B007SNMYNS|5.0|There is a lot of good and pertinent information in these pages. It may not apply to everyone --- but what if it does? Information is power and this book is packed. If you have the wrong information you can not make necessary changes to your lifestyle. To top it off, as well as being a credible source of facts and data, Dr. Davis is a very readable author. I found myself in many bouts of spontaneous laughter throughout the book. This book stays close to me for constant reference. Thank you, Dr. Davis.
B009JNXK88|4.0|where a bit to get used to at first, but still quite fun. I really like that if you fail, or if you redo levels, it shows a shadow of your previous run, so you can compete against yourself to improve your time/score.

Can't recommend enough.

B000HX4ZF6|5.0|I truly enjoyed this movie. After all these years, this is the first time seeing it, as it was recommended by some people on Youtube.  The story was entertaining.

B002U5HKZ6|5.0|This is a mega epic of a life lived on the edge. The main character seems to fall into every step of his life somewhat by accident yet embraces every bit of the adventure with gusto. I definitely will read the next installment.

0547564651|5.0|5-stars, hands-down.<br /><br />I'm a Teach For America alum, and am still teaching in a minority, low-income, Title I school. Lately, I've been struggling with how teachers and society in general can begin to solve the problems of urban poverty. For me, this is more than just an academic exercise; it's inherently personal. Should I stay in teaching? Should I go to law school and work to change the &#34;system?&#34;<br /><br />This book put things in perspective in a thorough, cohesive way. The author describes how it isn't necessarily intelligence or income that predict how children succeed, but intangible character traits (as the cover says, grit and curiosity are among these). Mr. Tough starts from when children are infants, and thoroughly discusses--with a host of research and references--what interventions can be made to help give all students a change for future success.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for anybody remotely interested in the problems of urban generational poverty, school reform, and social work.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|Was good but just another twist to Aliens, should have know it being done by the same writer. Helped fill in some of the blank's Aliens left off with. not bad...
0812992784|5.0|I haven't read anything else by Salman Rushdie but probably will now.  This account of the persecution of an artist by religious zealots is as old as humanity but told in a way that you can't put it down.  The artist reveals himself as a flawed human being, but one who has the right to free expression nonetheless.  The story of how he survived a decade of assassination threats and the curtailment of his personal and artistic life, and the people who helped him to survive it physically and spiritually is fascinating reading.  Ironically many of his friends died before he did while he was the one expected to die or be killed.  Some of Rushdie's translators and publishers were killed or attacked during the decade of the fatwa.  This is an ongoing struggle and one we are all involved in, like it or not.

0240816250|4.0|I taught photography at diploma level for a couple of decades. This is a one stop book of everything which we really needed back in say 1994. It has a brilliant collection of film based photography techniques and approaches. For digital I think the main idea is that you shoot to negative and then scan. From there you can move to alternative processes (which could have been easily expanded)you can print to inkjet or making inkjet negs/positives go back into the darkroom. I thought going to and output beurau is a little dated now, as the printing industry is going to direct to plate or straight digital presses. My opinion is that this is doomed already!. Nothing really beats a picture made simply with the silver gelatine ways and this book includes lots of ideas for darkrooms for those whose experience is not a direct one. very good book, but also look to ebay for old Ilford and Kodak books etc and the excellent bibliography in the back of this handy book. Like Letterpress printing silver based photography is real and it involves a journey. Get moving!
B00A0A6F7C|5.0|I love Susan's voice and all of her albums. But to be absolutely honest, her previous albums have been good, and I've enjoyed them all, but this album blows them away. Her voice is absolutely superb on these songs. Her version of Over the Rainbow is an obvious tribute to the legendary Eva Cassidy, and she nails it!<br />The quality of this album is excellent, the orchestrations wonderful, and her voice lovely. With this album, she has shown what a true professional she has become!
0345803485|5.0|I've never read erotica that was also a page turner, and Fifty Shades is both. Read it with your boyfriend or husband to spice things up. I don't care that the writing is clunky and cliched--the story is unique, the sex scenes are creative and varied, and the characters are oddly compelling. Enjoy!
B009G8GRX6|5.0|I can't stop jammin' to this album. I can't recommend it, or Muse, enough to you. Browse the samples and do yourself a favor, buy the album as soon as possible.
B007MG360G|5.0|Fun game on the farm.<br /><br />Fun for people all ages from 1 -100.<br /><br />When I first tryed this game I was 9 for I have 20 games on my kindle I played this one and a couple of other games more than any of the other games.
B001LA6TR6|5.0|I love Muse, but I'm not the biggest fan of live recordings...I didn't expect to be jammin' and gunning for more live stuff. Highly recommended.
B0035G04TI|5.0|This book explains why - despite our best effort to express our love - our partner may feel unloved: We speak different \\"love languages\\"! As I read Dr. Chapman's explanation of the five different ways to express and receive love, and that people only \\"get\\" the expression of love, if it is communicated in the language they understand, I began to see why, after an initial phase of being in love, my relationships ended because we lost our connection. We each did express our love with the gestures and words that meant love to us, but they did not meet the emotional needs of the other person. Wow! And this is such an easy fix, once you know what's going on! And I bet it works in every day life, at work, with friends etc as well.<br /><br />Another amazing relationship book I read recently is [[ASIN:B008STO74A How to Have A Match Made in Heaven]] by Ariel & Shya Kane. They cover every stage of relationships through conversations with singles and couples - and you can watch the conversations via a link on-line as well! Their advice is fresh, down to earth, sometimes surprising, sometimes humorous, and always compassionate. And since they work as a couple, both genders' perspectives are reflected, which gives extra depth to their suggestions.<br /><br />Both books are well-written and easy and fun to read. Even though they are organized such that you can easily just read one chapter and continue with the next one whenever you have time again, I just found it difficult to put them down.<br /><br />I highly recommend both books for anyone who wants to find new, effective ways to create your next relationship or transform your existing relationship into the relationship of your dreams.

1423140591|4.0|I was really excited to read this book since the first one was  a little disappointing. The characters here are more likable than in the other book and the story is somehow more  adventurous. One thing that i didn't like is that Rick characters, like Percy, don't seem to change much over time in respect to their way of thinking. As in the book, Percy thinks the same as  in  The Lightning Thief. But, either way the book is a mus read for all Percy Jackson fans.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I really enjoy this game! Some of the levels were pretty challenging, requiring more focus than some other games! I am surprised at how tricky this game can be considering how simple of a concept it is! I downloaded it while on some sale, it certainly wasn't $4.95! But even still, thinking of the hours spent playing this...it's a pretty good value.

0307593312|3.0|Murakami is a very innovative writer who comes up with a mixed bag of works, some truly fine and others rather pretentious. This novel, I'm afraid, is of the latter type. While rather creative and at times intriguing, it seems that Murakami intentionally drags out the story line with overlapping plots and characters as to show his artistic prowess. This novel would have been a very fine one if it were half the length. I wonder if the author was again stranded as before on some small Greek island in the middle of winter and had decided to kill time by adding pages and unncessary pages and irrelevant descriptions in order to kill time.<br />He'll probably receive a Nobel Award in the near future, and this novel might be listed as one of the reason, but count me out.
B004EPZ070|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie.  LOVE the soundtrack, bought the soundtrack on my iTunes.  Book was better, wish that the rest of the series was made into movies as well.  Kate Winslet's character got what was coming to her in the end!!

B0031RSA24|5.0|I have spent a lifetime analysing my Roman Catholic roots and biblical teaching, venturing into other religious congregations and even into Hinduism, through yoga classes and guru teaching. I refashioned god to suit all the different views; from the Jewish god of judgement and fear, the Protestant profession of unworthiness and sinfulness; the Catholic redemption and confession of sin, to the rather more joyful Hindu celebration of the growth of the indwelling god; realising and expressing the divine in one's life and actions.<br />Suddenly it was revealed to me that GOD was actually not required in my belief system. I provided my own motivation by living, loving and respecting the world around me for what it is. Nature and the universe in all its majesty, awesome<br />brilliant, beautiful, cruel, unfathomable, but all evolving along universal laws.

B00932HEX2|2.0|I bought this 1st season after reading so many pro-reviews. I have to say I can't agree. Fine acting, sure, but the last thing I want to see after another depressing day at work is a series that reminds us of all the religious hate in this world.<br />Not one moment in this series did I ever smile, let alone laugh.<br />Dark and depressing.<br />I couldn't help but feel like the show was trying to brainwash me into understanding why extremist muslims do what they do.<br />This series, as well as it is acted, is anything but entertaining.<br />It's DEPRESSING.<br />And incredibly contrived to try to sway non-muslims into understanding why muslims murder innocent people. Civilians. Not soldiers.<br />Wouldn't it be refreshing if the producers of this would make a series that tried to explain to the world why muslims want to kill americans so much? They seem to kill their own kind even more than anyone else. 9-11 killed how many americans? How many muslims did america kill in retaliation? They ended up getting far more muslims killed than americans.<br />No doubt they thought the act itself would be worth it, but they were so wrong.<br /><br />I wish I could get a refund not just for my money, but for my time watching it.
B003O86FMW|1.0|it was good i<br /> liked it and I like the movies also me and my friends like the hunger games
B004EPZ08Y|4.0|I'd like to first say that I don't think any of the FD movies are all that bad. Maybe I'm crazy, but although pretty much everyone agrees that 4 was a disaster, I didn't think it was *that* bad. And, really, I liked 3 for the creativity, especially the tanning salon, the train, the truck engine, and the nail gun deaths. All of that was great.<br /><br />I really think that 5, while clearly more intelligent, psychological, and well-written and acted than any of the others, bar none, still lacks what I thought made 2, which is IMO the best in the whole series, stand out: Suspense, brutality, and of course, Clear Rivers, the only person to survive the original FD, but not unscathed, to say the least.<br /><br />See, 5's deaths are just not all that interesting. When you compare them to what happened in the far more brutal 2 and 3, they just aren't as interesting. I didn't find any of them particularly memorable (except the very last, of course, which is a huge WHAM of an ending that you might even see coming from a few hints in the beginning), and I can't agree that the eye surgery scene was that gruesome. Yes, we get Bludworth again, and this time his role really means something. We also get another suspicious cop who thinks the whole thing is screwed up (which, if you don't know the ending of this one, you can't understand why he doesn't sympathize like the other cop in FD2), and the film seems to take itself seriously for once.<br /><br />Like video game exploits that are patched up after release, the FD series seems to add some new mechanic that can potentially foil Death's plan. This time, though, that *really* makes for a killer ending. (As they say, love makes you crazy...especially when you're doomed to die, anyway.)<br /><br />In any case, if you want to rinse out the sourness from 4 which practically turned it into a violent and stupid comedy, 5 is definitely the ticket you're looking for. It's hard to imagine that they would have anywhere else to go with this series, since everything was supposed to have already played out in 4, but they managed to get more in there with 5 in a special way...What else is there? If they did any more, none of the other films would really make sense. So, while I'd love to see another, unless they really find a creative story to throw in there with a brilliant new mechanic, I don't think we'll be seeing another FD again.<br /><br />A very solid replacement \\"conclusion\\" of sorts to a series that initially ended on a very meh note.
B005LAIHZY|1.0|My wife enjoyed the movie's mother/daughter theme much more than myself, my 2 boys and 1 girl ... as such, perhaps Brave is one of those films that resonates with a certain demographic.  However, I was turned off right from the title and cover shots of the film, which reminded me too much of Braveheart.  And, while watching the film, all I could think of was this film is a horrible collision of Braveheart, Poltergeist and Brother Bear. My kids ranging from 12 to 2 sadly also agreed :(

I thought they might be a little too complex for him, but I was pleasantly surprised when he took to them right away.<br /><br />I was really impressed by the quality. The set is made in Italy(!) and the pieces feel very sturdy. The reason why I give it 4 stars is assembling them can be a little tricky even for an adult. But it does challenge my little one, so there is a benefit to that.<br /><br />Another toy that I absolutely love is the [[ASIN:B000F8I5AE Tangle Therapy by Tangle]] puzzle. My son plays with it for hours on end, and anything that captures his attention is always exciting - for both him and me :)
B008KE3960|3.0|Good graphics, interesting game play, a good way to kill a little spare time. The unlockables come fast enough to keep you interested, but not so fast that you can't keep up. A nice little game.
B006T5FDLG|4.0|Following up \\"Death Magnetic\\" by three-plus years, and the Metallica/Lou Reed collab \\"Lulu\\" by a matter of weeks, Metallica finally returned in 2012 with another full-length. Just kidding; Metallica are not the type of band that turns out new music that fast. So, instead of another full-length, what we get is \\"Beyond Magnetic,\\" an E.P. comprised of b-side-esque tracks recorded during the \\"Death Magnetic\\" sessions. But \\"Beyond Magnetic\\" is far from being an outtakes album; in fact, any one of these four songs actually stacks up quite well against what was heard on \\"D.M.\\".<br /><br />With its excellent vocal hooks and really memorable choruses, \\"Hate Train\\" could potentially be a hit-single. It does have two solos, though, which are rare in singles (one of them is ripping, the other careening). Indeed, Kirk Hammett gets to really strut his stuff, here, and does so with crunchy, belligerent riffing and wah-drenched leads. \\"Just A Bullet Away\\" has the potential to be another hit single, though, as it boasts \\"One\\"-esque chugging, pounding, churning rhythms, and unforgettably infectious choruses. And it offsets its thrashy metal heft with a nicely melodic breakdown (complete with acoustic guitars and harmonic leads) midway through. Next, following \\"Hell And Back,\\" which augments its irresistible hooks with one of the best and most ripping solos in Kirk Hammett's career; comes the set closing \\"Rebel Of Babylon,\\" which begins as a power ballad before becoming a blistering and muscularly-riffed piece of modern thrash.<br /><br />\\"Beyond Magnetic\\" may lack the meat needed to satisfy the worldwide call from legions of fans for Metallica to release a new full-length; but it is definitely something substantial enough to chew on while we're waiting.

0385342039|5.0|This book is by far my favorite Sophie Kinsella book--it might even be one of my favorite books of all time. All of the main characters are adorable, and Sadie is hilarious. I couldn't stop laughing or smiling while reading this book, and I cannot recommend it enough!

0385342063|4.0|I love Sophie Kinsella's books, she always makes me laugh and holds my attention. I really loved the majority of this book, and then suddenly it ended. We get to see the buildup to their romance, but then none of the actual romance. It almost felt like she meant to write more but had to end it so she just tied up the loose ends as quickly as possible. The second time Magnus proposed I wanted to yell at the character. It just seemed like an added complication for the sake of having a dramatic final scene. So overall I had a great time reading it, but there just wasn't enough evidence of sexual tension. It felt more like a book about a girl discovering herself than a romance.

B004SGWYW4|5.0|This anime was good.  If you like movies about zombies you can also like this one.  I kind of think of it as The Walking Dead only in anime and more gory.  Will recommend it if you like your anime with kinkness and blood.  Usually for the hard core.

B0041KVW2K|1.0|I' m writing from Italy<br /><br />I' ve got a EU PRESSINGS Box, the main BIG PROBLEMS on my EU pressings are:<br />LAST 2/3 SONGS  OF EACH SIDE of:<br />-Sgt Pepper<br />-White Album disc 1<br />-Abbey Road (bad distorted sound starting from Golden Slumbers)<br /><br />Especially on these albums the LAST 2/3 SONGS  OF EACH SIDE sound very very BAD and DISTORTED... too bad<br />Pay attention for example on how good the first songs of side 1 of the white album sound and how bad \\"Happiness Is a Warm Gun\\" sounds!<br />Or how good \\"With A Little Help\\" is and how bad \\"Mr Kite\\" is!<br />The more it goes nearer to the last song the more it gradually sounds worse!<br />It's really a pity because the remasters would sound really GREAT (the beginning of each album sounds really great!)  but they received a very poor pressing<br /><br />Moreover 1 record is warped (with the beatles)<br />Result: I will ask the refund and send the box back<br />P.S. Amazon was perfect in answering to my questions and trying to sove this problem, so all my complaints go ONLY TO EMI QUALITY CONTROL

B005PK553C|5.0|If the writers can keep this series going & the amazing performances continue....I shall be a most faithful and happy viewer.  Watching this season back to back as a movie puts it on my never fail movie list along titles like, &#34; Thr Shining&#34;, &#34;Rosemary's Baby&#34;, &#34;The Sixth Sense&#34;, & &#34;Silence of the Lambs&#34; to name a few of its contemporaries in my humble genre fan opinion:).<br />Submitted by a pleasantly surprised new fan:)<br />Funkeejlite.<br />P.S. Peace to the creators, writers, & performance artists and if you can make a Season 3 now it may just help keep my dark twisted side entertained and satiated.  Stories like these...well...it helps keep my precious little remaining sanity, & i need whatever I've still got, trust me!  or...wait, Do I need sister Jude????  Nooooooo!!!!!  Just new AH series to watch constantly, then I'd be fine:). LMAO!!  :D<br />In short, Bloody Great Work!  A creepy delight with hot eye candy playing complex and relatable, understandable characters and story lines.  Thoughtful and sick...I LOVE it!!!  Who wouldn't unless they haven't seen it;)

B009B0L324|5.0|OK! I just listened to the LIVE AT RIVER PLATE CD! And i must say it is the best sounding live album they have ever put out. The things i notice right off the bat is that the band is on fire majorly & hit all there marks. Compared to the 1992 LIVE album what stands out is no marshal mesa boogie combo amps! Angus's sound on this album is true to the 100 watt marshals. Also what makes a huge impact is Phil Rudd on the drums, Compared to Chris Slade Phil is a monster and the true back bone to this band. And if you want to compair to IF YOU WANT BLOOD well it sounds better and is recorded better, It is a double album and the crowd is mic-ed perfect and are insane and make the recording sound even better. Yes there are song's on here that are on the other live albums but they sound great & i think this is a much better and more well put together album vs the 1992 LIVE album.Plus on the 1992 Live Angus Young's guitar goes from speaker to speaker depending on what side of the stage he ran to. Just Get it And TURN IT UP! You can thank me later. LET THERE BE ROCK!!! -Mike ; )-~
B0041KVW2K|1.0|Analog happens only once. Original sounds are emitted and recorded onto open reel magnetic tape. (40+ years ago that is!). \\"Vinyl\\" was cut from those master Beatles tapes and vinyl maintained the analog chain quite nicely right into your home.  Short of listening to the original master and that aint happenin'... the best quality is the Vinyl cut from the master tape ie, what they did originally. It is still PURE 100% Analog. Then this debauchery came along. IF one is to convert the master tapes to a digital format then it's digital from that point forward. It has lost it's analog component forever and ever. Information is missing and that has been accepted fact for some time. There is NO returning to analog once a signal has been digitized. It doesn't work that way. The conversion only goes in one direction. analog ----> to digital. There is NO Reverse. People who DO reverse it as in this case, make a fraud of the whole affair and mislead people into thinking because it's vinyl spinning around its analog or at least somehow closer to analog. No it's not! This method can't be taken seriously so one must conclude its a marketing deception. Add to that the poor pressing history and it's quite a failure sonically. No amount of EQ dynamic restoration , limiting, compression, etc, can bring missing information back. If you wanted true analog, where will you find it? I dunno, but not here. Keep searching.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This book is my favorite so far in the series, which is saying a lot because each book has been incredible.  The characters are believable and complicated, and the plotline sucks you in.  My only complaint is that these books have a tendency to piss me off.  A lot of things happen that you just don't want to happen, and a lot of it is ridiculously cruel.  I can't tell you how many times so far in the series my poor phone has been thrown across the room while I've screamed \\"F*** THIS BOOK!\\"  I have never reacted so strongly to a book before, and I am not alone among my group of friends to react this way.  That should tell you how well it is written.  READ THESE. And when you're done, come with me so we can go punch George R.R. Martin in the nose.  He went to great lengths to piss me off.  I feel it's only fair. lol.

0062060554|5.0|A librarian recommended it, and it was riviting from page one.  I was amazed that this was the first book written by this author.  There are lots of surprises for the reader.
0765350386|5.0|The Mistborn novel is truly an original, stand out piece of Fantasy, in that it not only focuses on Sanderson's new type of magic, but the tense plot to over throw a tyrannical ruler. Sanderson pieces together a crew of thieves and vagabonds to form a close knit group of men that fight together for the freedom of a subjugated race of men and women.  Leading this group is a common stereotype seen in many fantasy novels but never utilized as Sanderson has wonderfully done here. Kelsier is a thief with an odd set of morals, willing to fight and destroy the Lord Ruler, a self-appointed god over all men. A Mistborn himself, Kelsier wields the power of Allomancy, using metals to fuel various types of powers.<br /><br />The story, however, focuses on Vin, a street rat who is discovered by Kelsier to be a Mistborn like himself. Through training and well written sparring scenes, Sanderson's wholly original magic is downright believable and truly unlike anything fantasy readers have witnessed so far. Joining this group of thieves willing to overthrow the Final Empire, Vin grows drastically into a powerful Mistborn determined to fight alongside Kelsier in his quest. The novel takes off into a world of intrigue and realism, constantly bringing in new magical elements that keep the reader glued to the pages. Many questions are raised, some answered, and some left to the following novels. The novel lays a wonderful foundation for what lies ahead, incorporating fantasy, action, and Sanderson's clean writing fashion into an original work of art.

B0098JJYZQ|5.0|I absolutely loved Gabriels Rapture. The story line is captivating and I love the characters. Professor Emerson gives Christian Grey hot competition.  Sylvain Reynard is a fabuloous writer and Gabriels Inferno & Rapture is my all time favorite.
0062073192|1.0|I thought this book would be better, like the actual Journal from the show. It's not. There are way too many inconsistencies between it and the show. John was never my favorite but after reading this I disliked him even more... It was very disappointing, I wouldn't buy it, check it out from the library if you can which is what I did. Not worth it to spend money on it. Unless you like reading repetitive journal entry's about Mary being dead, being in a new place and being hellbent on finding the thing that killed Mary. After reading this book I just wanted to take his poor kids away and give them to Bobby because he'd probably be a better father then John was.

B004SUWR2C|5.0|This classic board game brought to life on the tablet is a lot of fun and very well done. The free version that I orginally had only workd on the older Kindle Fires and not on the HD Kindle which I was not happy about. However, the paid version was only 99 cents so it was worth it.

B0069G5Z9K|3.0|This game is fun, don't get me wrong. However if you want to excell at it, you will need to fork out money to buy extras. The fact that it is a free download is a bit confusing because in order to play it to the fullest, you will fork out a lot of money to buy all of the extras.

B00A7PXBPE|5.0|Arrow is a surprisingly great show and apparently a real winner for the struggling CW. Yes, it's another hero show, but this one has a secret weapon I did not see coming - the hero is played by a relative newcomer (having had parts in Private Practice, Heartland, Hung and Vampire Diaries) Stephen Amell. Beautifully playing Oliver Queen, son of a very rich but underhanded father who dies in his arms after their yacht sank in a terrible storm leaving him the only one alive on a mysterious island somewhere off the grid. The fact that he is also easy on the eyes (translated also a beautiful guy!) makes this show fun for us girls, too!<br /><br />Before his father died, he made Oliver promise to right all of the wrongs he made when evidently greed trumped compassion in the building of the Queen empire. While Oliver lands on the island a spoiled rotten rich kid who has led a life of decadent consumption, the mysteries begin unraveling quickly for him. He must survive on his own, learning to do things he never dreamed he would have to do. Enter a mysterious Chinese man who, up to the most recent episode, pops into his life, saving him from a very dark encounter with a very dangerous group of men we still haven't been told of their origin.<br /><br />We can only assume, up until now, that everything that happened to Oliver on that island for five years, taught him how to appear and disappear, shoot an arrow so deftly, it defies reality, and has honed his body into a sort of killing machine.<br /><br />He comes home, much to the delight of his mother and sister who had thought him dead, and quickly but secretly sets up shop in an abandoned Queen-owned warehouse and sets about fulfilling the promise he made to his father on the life raft before he died. Now the story is set up for him to assume the role of a vigilante he becomes known as Arrow.<br /><br />Arrow is a fun show, more intelligent than many like it, with great characters we like to love, the ever intriguing secret identity, the loyal sidekick, John, the beginnings of the requisite unrequited love story, and great weekly stories we can look forward to.<br /><br />Most of us have too much to do and not enough time to do it all in, so we have to be picky about which shows to invest time in. I say WATCH THIS ONE! Fun enough to keep you interested, intelligent enough to not feel too guilty about and a handsome cast - something for everybody. Also, popular enough that CW has already picked up a full season with good reason to believe more years to come. A definite winner all the way around. ARROW - CATCH UP HERE ON AMAZON, then look forward to new shows on CW each week. Enjoy!identity, the loyal sidekick, John, the beginnings of the requisite unrequited love story, and great weekly stories we can look forward to.<br /><br />Most of us have too much to do and not enough time to do it all in, so we have to be picky about which shows to invest time in.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have received so much comfort from reading this book.

0062127241|4.0|When I opened Pete Townshend's memoir, Who I Am, I expected to read a revealing story about a talented and troubled artist. I found that and more on the pages of this finely written book. I was surprised at the high quality of Townshend's writing. He tells his story with precision and care, and any reader who enjoys this genre will come away from this book very satisfied. Whether you like music, creativity or human nature, there's something beneficial for you on these pages. Unlike the tell-all sensationalism in some celebrity memoirs, I felt that Townshend was trying to reveal with candor and insight how he has become who he is. That's exactly the value that can be derived from reading a finely written memoir like this one.<br /><br />Rating: Four-star (Highly Recommended)

B008P76VP8|5.0|In all fairness, I need to correct the earlier review.  This is NOT the only recording on blu-ray.  I already own the Peter Sellers production from Berlin, conducted by Simon Rattle.  And no - you don't have to pay $333.  Just shop around with some other internet retailers like Presto Classical.  It's available in both DVD and Blu-Ray, just make sure to order the NTSC version (not PAL).  I don't want to take attention away from this Leipzig Recording , which is probably also great (in fact, I ordered a copy for myself) - but it's NOT the only option on blu-ray.  And the Sellers/Rattle production is a real gem in its own right - very innovative and moving.
B004T0XYM8|5.0|Bad Review Posts(Though far and few in between) such as a few listed below that put down Masterworks such as \\"Once Upon A Time In The West\\" ONE OF THE GREATEST WESTERNS IN HISTORY...By A Genius Director Mr.Sergio Leone, just can not be taken seriously and obviously these reviewers don't understand Film or Art.....especially from a Masterwork Filmaker,Director of Photography and Directorial Reference Point Of View.....These are the same people who would say The Beatles were no good....They wouldn't watch Charlie Chaplin because it's Black & White, Daniel Day Lewis and Meryl Streep can't act,and the Godfather, The Deer Hunter and Apocalypse Now was a waste of time.....So don't take these ridiculous reviews seriously Film Fans...it's absurd! Let them watch Kim Kardashian...that is the mentality we are dealing with here!<br />Sorry..I Just had to say something!
B008MU8ZNO|5.0|If you've never seen this you need to. I have watched it so many times I can almost say the lines before the actors. Maybe that's not a good thing. The movie is however. Lots of laughs and if you're a sissy you might even jump at a few scenes. It's definitely not a serious horror movie and the effects are cheap but effective. The writers were very creative with the alien clowns. Popcorn shooting guns, balloon animal bloodhounds, and a circus tent spaceship. This is one of my all time favorite movies  and if you weren't turned off by the title of it you will probably love it too. I was thrilled when it came out on blu-ray. Buy this movie today. If the earth is invaded by killer clowns you'll be glad you did.
B003ZSI7R2|5.0|This band is fantastic. Their sound is a very convincing mid to late 60s rhythm and blues style with an incredible vocalist fronting some extremely talented blues musicians.<br /><br />HOWEVER, if you get the chance to see them live, take it!  They opened for the Who the other night in Boston and I've got to say the energy and the atmosphere definitely fueled their performance to amazing heights.<br /><br />As great as the CD is, it would be even better if they had some way to capture that energy from their live shows!
B008K8VDPU|5.0|recommend this one. it is fun easy and just awesome. i am no good at piano but this was neat.
B0041KVW2K|1.0|Hello, I just returned my Sgt. Pepper Vinyl as the album was unplayable. Clearly there are some LP's with defective pressing. I gave up when I got to Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds as the sound was horrible with one side having distortion and the sound coming in loudly and softly. This doesn't hold a candle to my old 60's Pepper pressing. DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR IF YOU WANT THIS ALBUM, GO TO YOUR LOCAL VINTAGE RECORD SHOP AND PICK IT UP. Original analog sound with no pressing issues, maybe a few warm cracks and snaps. If you choose to buy, buyer beware.

B00975L4MW|4.0|This comment is for the Mofi edition. The music is of course fantastic, and the cover art faithfully done. The mastering is excellent, and quite dynamic and spacious.<br />BUT- why then  press it to very noisy vinyl. Is this a cheap alternative to the a-grade vinyl used for the full price albums. If all the SILVER SERIES are this noisy , I will not purchase further.<br />Is this a quality control issue, or an inferior product at a reduced price??

You must be carefuly in the future. Sapnish is from Europa and american spanish is really diferent for us.
B009HV2JT8|2.0|Why don't we take 90% of vampire mythology and chuck it because it doesn't work with our shooting schedule?  Then we can pick a beloved historical figure and make them look ridiculous and self serving.  Last let's blame the proliferation of slavery on vampires needing a food supply and not on the plantation owners who didn't want to have to pay for labor.  How anyone could write such garbage is beyond me.  Being a vampire fan I certainly hope most studios will steer clear of the \\"historical\\" monster movies in the future.

Love every song except, perhaps, for the last one \\"The Thin Line Between Love And Hate\\" - somehow this song fails to impress me but the other 9 songs are very close to perfection. Totally love this album!
B000E1YW0E|4.0|I got the 2 disc special edition, but the DVD case is made for one DVD so I have to squeeze both DVDs in there. The DVD is also a little scratched so it skips sometimes. Other than that, it's good. I love this movie!
B000AP04L0|5.0|Peter Gibbons is tired of his dead end office job. His cubicle is a prison, and he can't take anymore. He falls victim to a botched hypnotherapy session and has a new attitude. He doesn't give a flip anymore! He snags a new girlfriend and a promotion with his new refreshing attitude. No sooner has his life started looking up, when an old revenge plot on his company goes terribly wrong. Now Peter and his 2 buddies are rich, at their employers expense. Will they get sentenced to a federal a** pounding penitentiary, or will they be able to set things right.....or will the building burn down?<br /><br />This is one of my favorite comedies ever. It's immeasurably funny. The actors, gags, and plot twists will leave you rolling. This is a movie that you will never forget! Don't miss Office Space.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This game is incredibly engaging. The storyline is interesting and keeps you wondering what the next piece of the puzzle will be. The graphics and sound are great. The find the object puzzles are mixed with other thought puzzles. This game is definately worth the 2.99.
B0012QE4Q2|4.0|Anne, and Mary Boleyn are sisters. They have been assigned the task of seducing the King of England. Their competition leads to bitter rivalry, hatred and jealousy, not to mention the reshaping of an Empire's history. The King desires a male heir, but his current Queen cannot produce one. After taking Anne as his mistress, he is yet to have a son. Now with many daughters, King Henry decides to court Mary Boleyn. Mary provides a boy heir for him. Now with the Queen and the mistress out of the picture, King Henry needs an excuse to marry Mary. He has to change the national religion.<br /><br />This is a very entertaining movie. I don't know how historically accurate the plot is, but it I don't really care. I enjoyed watching this film. The acting and drama are quite good. It's not usually the type of subject that a guy like me cares much for, but I did enjoy it. I imagine that a woman audience could find more to love about this movie than myself. I highly recommend this movie, especially to all the women out there.
B001BANK32|5.0|I have never been afraid of the dark... until now!!!!<br />Warm words from a warm soul. I got a nibble
B00028HBKM|5.0|We all know the story of Jesus Christ. He lived as a human and committed no sin. He was the perfect man. Because of this he was able to settle the debt we have built with our sins buy acting as a human sacrifice. This movie gives us a look at how his final hours may have transpired. It's very powerful and very upsetting.<br /><br />This is an incredible movie. It is passionate, as the title suggests, and very realistic. The acting is perfect and the message is timeless. Whether you believe that Jesus was the son of God or not, you can appreciate the passion and love he had for his fellow man. It's amazing to think that he endured what he did as a human, when he also possessed the power of God. If you can handle the brutality and emotional toll this film will take on you, I strongly recommend it. Be ye warned! It's extremely graphic and hard not to look away from at times.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Recommend to all parents with children.  Compelling story; really enjoyed!! The author includes a number of turns and twists in his story telling.
B000094A6A|4.0|A group of guys having a mid-life crisis decides to go back to college and relive their better days. They decide to start a new fraternity. They friends go on a hunt to recruit the right members. This movie is the story of those guys and the rejects that they find to join them. The Dean doesn't like their plan and has made it his personal mission to get them expelled.<br /><br />This movie is totally hilarious. It has a pretty good cast, a fun story, and classic comedy moments that you'll never forget. This version contains some racey deleted scenes and has 5.1 Dolby Digital audio. This is a must see for any fan of the comedy genre.
0061537969|5.0|This book got the best of me.  I could hardly stand to read the ending!  Enzo was one special dog.  My Bluto is a female Enzo!  I've always said she doesn't speak English, but she understands it!  Beware dog lovers (and cat lovers) everywhere, you'll be in tears right down to the last word of this wonderfully and amazingly poignant story!!
B00005JNBQ|4.0|Napoleon is a loser in every aspect of the word. That's what makes him such a lovable character. Apparently everyone that lives in his town is a loser too. This town of losers makes for an interesting story. The lives of Napoleon and his friends are quite strange, in a funny way. This movie has a very thin plot. Napoleon helps his friend win the student counsel election, gets a fairly cute girlfriend, and avoids getting wrapped up in his uncle's insane schemes. After that, he successfully goes to the prom and steals the show at the school talent show. This guy is a loser, but he can dance like a mofo. If you haven't seen Napoleon get beat up, have his tater tots smashed in his pants, and dance his heart out, you are missing out.
B008N1V11U|4.0|they really make this .99cents like they did with spiderman. like spiderman but batman for mobile. but it is the best app tied with spiderman so yeah
B003ASLJQS|5.0|Jimmy, Dave, and Sean are 3 childhood friends that have drifted apart after a tragedy changed their lives forever. Years later, Jimmy's 19 year old daughter is murdered. Dave is a suspect. Dave is now a cop scrambling to solve the mystery before Jimmy takes it upon himself to resolve the matter his way.<br /><br />This is a very sad and touching tale of friendship, innocence lost, and betrayal. The acting, screenplay, and drama are all fantastic. This is everything you expect from director Clint Eastwood, and it is also Sean Penn's best movie. This is a shocking and emotional movie that will leave you stunned at the conclusion. It's a must see for any movie lover.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this app. it is especially useful for grocery lists, task lists, and this year it has become extremely useful for making and sending Christmas lists and keeping track of what you have purchased for who.
B009VA1FN6|4.0|I was excited to learn of Kate Morton's new novel but on reading the first few chaptersI was disappointed because of the myriad of characters. I stuck with it and I am so glad that I did. Kate weaves a tale of family, mystery & intrigue that wil keep you entraced until the very last. She moves from the 2nd World War, London in particular,to the present day with ease, laying the foundation for a breathtaking finale.
B004XS97KO|5.0|I ALREADY OWN PART 1 OF SEASON 6 ON DVD. PART 2 WAS JUST AS AWESOME AS PART 1. I LOVED HOW AMY N RORY FOUND OUT THT THEIR CHILDHOOD FRIEND WAS REALLY THEIR DAUGHTER AFTER ALL THE YRS THEY GREW UP 2GETHER IN KILL HITLER. ALL THE EPISODES ARE JUST AWESOME N I WILL BE WATCHING THEM OVER N OVER AGAIN. I SPEND TIME IN THE SLEEPER WHILE MY FIANCEE DRIVER THE SEMI SO THE DOC WHO VIDS KEEP ME ENTERTAINED.
B0095J0AL6|5.0|There isn't one bad song on this album! Every song is perfect and shows off the boys amazing vocal abilities, I couldn't ask for more :) I Would and Over Again are my personal favorites. &#60;3 My favorite album at the moment. ~ A dedicated directioner
4789009637|3.0|Check to see if your class requires the second edition. I bought this under the impression that it was what I needed, and it turned out that there was a volume 2!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this app! it is very entertaining and helps time pass very quickly. The only complaints I have are that there are some things you almost have to pay for and that there are some additional (but free) downloads that come with the app. they aren't required, but you almost have to get them. (again they are free) other than that, I love it!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The title says it all. This is an incredible book series. I could not put it down. In fact I think I read all 3 books atleast 3 times!
B008220DGE|5.0|the master is not a movie that bothers to be conventional. it is not a movie that wants the story to be wrapped up with a pretty bow...it is a movie that holds up a mirror to social interactions and human desire at its most intimate...and is at times savage and ugly. This movie may subtly offend ones sensibilities. If it makes you uncomfortable...isn't that the point? This is a movie that shows things how they are. This is a movie about the power of cult. People have a problem with the master due to it being a movie that challenges you to your very core...in a casual Freudian sort of way! It is not a movie that forces anything down your throat or tells you how to think...it opens up your mind and allows you to think for yourself.<br /><br />the absurdity of the story takes it to almost comic heights but the cast wisely plays it straight, to cold, cunning effect. amy adams plays a side role though a scene of her unique \\"relationship\\" with phillip intrigues and shines a light on her importance in the grande scheme of things. behind every great man is a great woman...and well behaved women never make history. let me tell you, we all know amy has been hyped from the day she got the role in junebug....but this time she proves she is worth her salt. joaquin reveals a stunning layer of himself and becomes a completely new person....phillip seymour hoffman is charismatic, at times riddled with insecurity and perfect in the role. the entire cast is so brave for what they choose to reveal through their performances...<br /><br />for those who are about to watch it...watch it from the point of the characters...watch how they interact with eachother and imagine what they want to imply versus what they honestly intend to do to each other. While certain scenes might seem on the surface to drag on and on..they bear symbolic importance to the internal emotional journey joaquin is undertaking.<br /><br />This movie hasn't made much money at the box office because that is not the value of the movie. It has been maligned by critics not due to it being a bad movie....but due to it not following the typical societal structure a \\"comfortable\\" movie would. Ironically...it is being punished for falling out of line.<br /><br />Live a little.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This movie has a wonderful romantic story. In fact, we watch it over and over, and it never seems to get old.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Such a sad story. I chose it because my youngest son, who is now 27, read it when he was in college, and mentioned it to me when we were talking about how great the movie looked. It made me cry. Good writing, but a bit simplistic. I am glad I got a view into this person's life, but, truthfully, I am not sure I could recommend it wholeheartedly.
B001QOGYBI|4.0|This is a good movie, especially for those who like stop animation. It also has a huge, well know cast who lend there voice talents.
0385535147|5.0|This book arrived on time, was in great condition, and was a magnificent read. I couldn't put it down! Worth the money and the hours of my life that I spent engrossed in it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The title says it all. This is an incredible book series. I could not put it down. In fact I think I read all 3 books atleast 3 times!
B00511ONPG|3.0|It was a wall written book and fairly useful. I did get way more out of taking an actual online class on the subject though.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I gave this app 5 stars because I like that the makers of Angry Birds came out with something just as entertaining as AB! It's fun and I love it!
B007UXTG8M|5.0|This was an incredibly touching movie. Fassbender's performance was unremarkable and the story was very well designed to be extremely compelling.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I'm a huge fan of this series! The first book was absolutely amazing despite some parts that pulled at my heart strings and the second one is just as great even though I'm not even half way through it. Totally worth every penny spent on this!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is awesome. It just keeps going and going but when you make a mistake you die and start all over again. This game is for all ages.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|I purchased this as a gift for my brother-in-law.  He loved it.  Watches it and re-watches it all the time.
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|see above.  Uninstalled never played it.  Installation issues.  Although android compatible, failed to work.  Sad 'cause I DO like Mahjong.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I purchased this as a gift.  Was a great buy.  My sister can watch and re-watch her fav episodes anytime.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|I admit that I was quite skeptical. However, I was totally blown away that, despite their ages, Page, Plant, and Jones could still rock so hard. You can tell that they are all enjoying themselves and having a whole lotta fun. With the exception of Trampled Under Foot, all of the songs still sound wonderful live after all of these years. I can't put my finger on it, but something is missing in this live version of such a great song from Physical Graffiti. Jason Bonham does a terrific job following in his father's footsteps. Page has not missed a beat, Plant, though unable to sing like in his glory days, still sounds great and still has that wonderful stage presence and charisma/charm. What I also love is to see John Paul Jones not standing in the shadows like in The Song Remains The Same. He's interacting with Page and Plant moving around a bit. The energy from all four guys here is just great to see and hear. This is a must own.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|Purchased this as a gift for my brother-in-law.  He LOVED it!  Now he can watch his fav episodes anytime.  Great buy.
1451662432|5.0|I am a huge fan. I loved his movies. I also think he is the best bodybuilder ever in the history. So I would love to read his autobiography. I didn't keep up with what he was doing during his political years. So I can't comment on that. Despite the huge ugly scandal, I still can't discredit on what he accomplished in life, and how he accomplish all these things as immigrants. I don't condone infidelity. What he did in his marriage is completely wrong. But what he accomplished in other aspects in his life and the focus he had to accomplish these things are still motivational to me, at least. As an immigrant, I view Arnold Schwarzenegger as a very successful immigrant who pursuits his dream and passion to reach the American Dream, which inspires me to do the same thing also. But for marriage, Arnold Schwarzenegger is an example of everything which I should not and would not be. Nonetheless, this book is a good read, can teach us and motivate us in various areas of our lives.
B0006PV5VC|5.0|Wow! I felt like I was the sole recipient of the performance!  I have another recording of Scheherazade but it doesn't even compare to this.  It literally gave me the chills at times to hear the talented musicians and the mastery of their conduction by Reiner.  I'm not holistically familiar with classical music but I do like Reiner's taste in choice and ability to conduct the multitude of choices available.  And, I know I will stay with Living Stereo recording as much as possible.  Thank you to those previous reviewers who guided me to choosing Reiners/Living Stereo CD's; I am forever grateful!
1593080409|5.0|I admit. I am a Sherlock Holmes Fan. I read the whole version in Chinese when I was a little kid. Then when I came to US, I used this book as a way to study English, so I loaned the book from library and read it through way back then. But now I would love to read them again because of the Sherlock TV show. This book has all the novel and short stories. It is two volume edtion, so make sure you get both volumes if you are looking for a complete collection of Sherlock Holmes. The print is kind of small, but as a mid 20 young adult. It has not been a issue for me yet. I didn't have the kindle version. So I can't comment on the format problems that many people are experiencing through the kindle version.
B009AJDDQU|4.0|Ever since I read &#34;The Wonderful Flight to the Mushroom Planet&#34; in 5th grade I've been hooked on SciFi books, films, memorabilia....  So many people try to pick apart every scene in a movie, myself, I choose to sit back and enjoy the fantasy.  I think if you're incapable of that then go surround yourself in REALITY TV and leave Us to our imagination.  All that to say that I enjoyed this film!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Super awesome!!! It shows the temp. how long you will have while doing different things it is sooooo AWESOME!!!!!!! :)
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Another great story by Nicholas Sparks. It was an easy read, full of suspense, and had an unexpected twist at the end. Can't wait for the movie version.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I rated this game 3 out of 5 because for some reason in creative mode it doesn't have all the items (flint and steel, diamond sword and pick, etc) also when I mine gold, it doesn't give it to you or iron or redstone.sorry this review was old and i was mining the ores with a wooden pickaxe.the new updates are sick with minecarts.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Good beginning , good ending but the stitches definitely show in the middle. For me John Grisham's earlier novels were distinguished by their balanced story-telling. The balance in The Racketeer is not there. The major pieces seem stitched together in a hurry, which is a shame because it could have been classic Grisham if he taken more time to develop the story. Slow down JG. With your reputation and bank balance you should have the luxury of time.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this game, the whole family plays it.  Its a great thing to bring the family together.  It can be played on all devices!  Android, iphone, kindle and ipod.  I am really enjoying the game.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Loved this one! I am not fond of cliff hangers though... especially since the next in the series is not out yet! These characters really get under your skin and I enjoy the way Riordan jumps between their perspectives so that every couple of chapters you get a fresh perspective.<br />In this book, Annabeth takes a leading role as she searches for something lost ages ago using the Mark of Athena as her guide. But her piece of the puzzle turns out to also be the key to saving the world and it will take the help of all her friends to do it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It's been a while since I read a book that made me want to stay up all night and keep on reading. I loved the plot and the suspense. The flow is just awesome. I would recommend this book to anyone.
0316228532|3.0|The book was ok, but it was to wordy and at times it lost my interest prefered the Harry Potter series
B0086700CM|5.0|I b up all night playing temple run as a matter of factly its 5 o'clock blend I ain't got no sleep
B0086700CM|3.0|i love temple run! but it freezes and forces me to shut down my kindle. once it deleted itself from my device and when i tried to reinstall it said already on device, after a couple emails and calls to amazon they ended up having to contact Imangi! cool app but frustrating!
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|I love the fact that Rebus I back. The past five years I've read many other detective books and never stopped comparing them to Rebus. Ian Rankin is the standard against which all other writers are being measured in my opinion. Hopefully many more books will follow.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Absolutely loved it, couldn't put it down, didn't want it to end...so I read it again. Don't bother with the movie until you read the book first.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|This ap is not working on my Fire Hd.  It only shows about 10 updates and it won;t refresh  Very annoying.  ,,
1400064287|1.0|This book is way too long. They could have written the whole book in one third it's volume to make it simple. The writers need to be effective. They talk about techniques like being simple, unexpected, concrete,credible, emotional& stories. However they seem to be totally lost in the countless useless information. Context is good but needs improvement on content. Definitely not recommended.
B00881VLCE|5.0|If you love puzzles then this is a great game for you. It has tons of beautiful pics to chose frome and will keep you busy for hours.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I am so addicted to this game. I cant stop playing this game I love it!! I regimen. this game for every one even kids. its a family friendly game.<br />I give this the highest rating.
B007R3AZNK|4.0|great songs and great musicians! Reminds me of the late, great Gary Moore. CD is well recorded and very entertaining.
B007YQ6SYK|5.0|Saw Michael live last summer and it was amazing to say the least, this album does not fail to disappoint either, every track gives off a different feel.
B003O85W3A|3.0|Although the vocal work is exceptional some the tunes I found are kind of repiticious.  For the most part I do enjoy listening to it.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|what game can be cooler then this this game is one of the best games I have played I highly recommend this awesome game.
B007VYDFMS|5.0|I had the privelege of seeing Marley in concert several times. I love his music. This film was worth watching and watching again. I reminded me of why this man was such a great performer and was filled with insights about his life.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It took me awhile to get into it but once I did I really liked it. The ending is great!!! Stick with it, it's worth the time.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Love this app. It's so easy to use and I use it every day. Like being able to listen when my eyes get tired
140053271X|5.0|I purchased this nook for a friend who was retireing.  She has had hand surgery and has difficulty with heavy objects.  She loves her nook simple touch.  She takes it everywhere she goes.  Fits easily in a purse or briefcase even a backpack.  It is easy to order and download books.  She even ordered magazines.  Great gift for anyone from toddlers to great grand parents.  Excellent for students.
B009LRE040|4.0|The title is a fancy way to say that Batman is back. Did the world need another Batman movie? No. But Wayne Enterprises; a multi-billion-dollar company owned by Bruce Wayne himself; is going bankrupt and popular superhero movies; this is the third in what is now a Christopher Nolan trilogy; make an insane amount of money. Two Face is dead and The Joker, a character who should've been mentioned if not given a cameo appearance, is in prison. Enter Bane, a strong vicious beast of a man with a gas mask stuck to his face. He wears it for a reason, but it muffles his voice sometimes to the point of being unintelligible.<br /><br />Not that these characters, including Anne Hathaway as a sexy Catwoman, ever have anything poignant to say. Christopher Nolan is a lot better at directing fight scenes than composing dialogue. So the fast-cut plot, riddled with minor plot-holes and unnecessary turns; Gotham City facing its demise in the form of a nuclear bomb is the gist; gets saved by its exciting and often violent action scenes. Most, if not all, of them coincide with epic Hans Zimmer orchestral music, yes; and the new flying bat-toy is kind of cool; but this Dark Knight, while entertaining, is a sequel that doesn't quite match the level of its predecessor.<br /><br />marcellee.com
B004EPYZTE|2.0|The 3d in this movie is nothing special, I've come to realize the best movies that look good in 3d are the ones that are either animated,cgi,or loaded with special effects. I rate 3 stars cause I like the movie, however I'd rate the 3d at a 1.2 stars. Im looking to start a 3d movie collection, thus far I have avatar,Conan, and transformers dark of the moon, with alice in wonderland on the way. But back to the movie, the price wasn't worth it especially since this movie only had 2-3 good 3d moments, and 2 of those moments were the beginning and credits of the movie that had the little fire ambers floating all over the place, wait for this to be under 10 dollars unless you are made of money
B008JAGZDE|2.0|Did the world need another slice of American Pie? The answer is, of course, no. And I'm referring to American Pie 2; the first in a set of unnecessary sequels, including four spin-offs. That the story continues to continue on, with an oddly-timed thirteen-year Reunion, thirteen years later, is a testament to the way the movie business works. It's not really about art. It's about money. So even moderately popular flicks spawn sequels almost automatically. That means this reunion just might be the first of more.<br /><br />When we met Jim Levenstein, he and his three best friends were high school seniors with a pact to lose their virginity before graduation. Now he's married with a kid, Kevin is married, Oz is a professional sportscaster and Finch... rides a motorcycle. But we shouldn't know any of this. Their stories should've ended with their high school graduation. The rest should've been left to our imaginations. Instead we get what feels like an extended epilogue; one that's long passed the length of the story itself.<br /><br />It is nice to see everybody again, particularly Stifler. He's not nearly as funny as he tries to be; the fake phone-call is the only thing he does that makes me laugh out loud; but his outrageousness makes him the funniest among semi-funny characters. It's just that the movie, as much as it tries with all its time-lapse jokes; Stifler pretends to read the Twilight series to connect with high school chicks and the Spice Girls Wannabe song now plays on the Classic Rock station; can only go so far on nostalgia alone.<br /><br />marcellee.com
1609611543|5.0|After a year of being tossed around in the health system with no answers and no help whatsoever, I began looking for ways to help myself.  This book came at just the right time!<br /><br />I was thin growing up, but started to pack on the pounds in my 20s.  I'm not celiac (been tested twice).  But I do have a myriad of neurological and digestive symptoms that have gone unexplained by doctors in all of the three hospitals I've seen so far.  The one treatment plan that all of my doctors agreed on was to send me to a dietitian to lose the weight.  (5'8\\"/210) I went to the dietitian who prescribed a low fat diet of light pastry in the morning, pasta for lunch and bread and vegetables for dinner.  Within 4 days of this diet I was in the emergency room with some serious nerve pain.  Within a week of starting the diet, I also developed weeping eczema that went out of control and responded NONE to the treatments that the hospital dermatologists gave me.  I went to see a new dermatologist who asked about food allergies (I have an allergy to wheat on the scratch test) and he told me to try giving up wheat and see if it helped the rash.  Right about this time, I got this book and was curiously interested at how different the opinions here-in are from the standard MD's opinion.<br /><br />So in July I went gluten free.  I immediately lost 15 lbs, the rash vanished completely, AND my nerve pain drastically improved.  After a while I doubted that it had been the wheat and wondered if I was just \\"getting better\\" on my own and tried slowly adding the wheat back in.  That was a huge mistake.  I immediately had digestive pain and within a few days, had terrible nerve pain again around my ribs.  As it turns out, I do have an underlying auto-immune disease that is aggravated very seriously by wheat gluten.<br /><br />I've since taken this foundation and started adapting the paleo diet (auto-immune protocol) and it's helped even more.  I'm still losing weight and continue to feel betteras long as I avoid the wheat.  While looking into some of the damage that wheat can do in our bodies, I found information about a gluten free diet helping people with Multiple Sclerosis, Chronic Fatige Syndrome, ADHD, Alzheimers, Asperger's, and Lupus, to mention a few, in addition to the blood sugar, cholesterol, and others mentioned in this book.  If you or someone you know suffers from one of these disorders, I strongly encourage you to read this book and do a little research of your own to see how you may be helped from the possibility of a gluten free diet.  Wishing you well...
B007V2UGPE|1.0|ok so i got to lvl 56 i had my guy maxed and beat the zombie mode and when i got back from my friends house i was at lvl 1!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! do not get this app unless you wanna lose ALL of your hard work and then be REALLY MAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Wonderful for all audiences. Don't miss it. I bought one just for myself so I can relax in peace. Danka
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I just thought it a very good read. I pretty much am prejudiced as far as anything Mitch Albom writes. He has this unique ability to write something and I know everyone else is reading it, but inside I also know it really was written just for me. I think if you ask ten people what the same book was about they would all give you a different answer. I wish I could explain it better. I hope you enjoy it as well. I'm certain for everyone this will be different. But I am guessing you will want to get rid of all your tme pieces, or start wearing two watchs so you are certain not to be cheated out of one second.
0307592731|4.0|Good book,  I really enjoyed reading it for our book club selection.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a true story to read.
B00992CF6W|5.0|As soon as I saw this game my kindle experience was much better! I can play multiplayer or just pass my time! I recommend this app for everybody!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game!! Its very addicting! I think I got one of the highest scores ever! I have almost over 12 million in this game! Even though the game kinda lags on my kindle fire....not to brag..even though I kinda am!!Sorry!)

B0071XO8RA|5.0|FANTASTIC!!! This is one of the best books I ever read. If you like sci-fi, you're gonna love it!!! I can't wait to start the SHIFT trilogy!!!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I have used beats in the past and these are much better for production and film. You are hearing a real sound.
B00005NKKZ|5.0|I cannot recommend this recording enough. Excellent for both happiness and reflection. Beautiful harmonies, excellent instrumentation, and no room for hate and violent thinking.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|This continues the tale of deviant behavior which is barely credible, but the story is just interesting enough to keep my attention.
B008RZF2I0|4.0|THE BAND: Thomas Youngblood (guitars), Casey Grillo (drums & percussion), Oliver Palotai (keyboards), Sean Tibbetts (bass), Tom Karevik (vocals).<br /><br />THE DISC: (2012) Available in single and double-disc packages. Single disc - 12 tracks clocking in at 56+ minutes, 16-page booklet with song lyrics, band member photos and thank you's. Limited Edition 2 CD set - 26 total tracks (disc 2 is the instrumental version of the album plus 2 bonus tracks), hardcover case with alternate cover artwork, a 44-page booklet and poster. Guest singers include Elize Ryd, Alissa White, and producer Sashca Paeth. Recorded at Gate Studios (Wolfesburg, W. Germany), Morrisound (Tampa), and Palosphere Studios (Stuttgart). This is studio album #10. Label - SPV/Steamhammer.<br /><br />COMMENTS: I have been a fan of Roy Khan's since his early days in Conception. I've been a fan of Kamelot's since the albums \\"Eternity\\" & \\"Dominion\\" (without Khan). Khan brought incredible life to Kamelot. I was truly saddened when I heard Khan was leaving the band (personal problems and depression). Khan is so unique, I thought Kamelot was finished. Then, I heard bootlegs of Fabio Lione (Rhapsody Of Fire) filling in on tour... and hated what I was hearing. So with Lione, I had written this band off. When \\"Silverthorn\\" hit stores in October, I was hesitant to say the least. I decided I had to hear samples before I bought the disc. The samples were good enough that I made the purchase the next day. Much to my surprise (and pleasure), Lione is not at the vocal helm, but former Seventh Wonder singer Tommy Karevik is. Sweden's Karevik can sing, even if he is kind of doing a modest Khan impersonation. As much as I think Khan is/was irreplaceable, Karevik does a respectable job. The melodies are catchy - the familiar master guitar work from Youngblood is present, as is the quick-footed Grillo with his double-bass drumming. Favorite tracks - \\"Sacrimony\\", \\"Veritas\\", and \\"Prodigal Son (Parts I & II)\\". The ballad \\"Song For Jolee\\" is good as well, with Karevik showing some sensitive versatility. I wanted to not like this album without Khan. However, change is sometimes unavoidable. \\"Silverthorn\\" rocks and I predict most Kamelot fans will not be disappointed (4+ stars).g For Jolee\\" is good as well, with Karevik showing some sensitive versatility.

B007IXWL2C|3.0|This  brings the tale to a happy ending.  the whole trilogy is entertaining and very light reading.  The graphic sex scenes are overdone and get rather boring
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This story reminds me a bit of Mr. Grisham's first book!  The ending is a real surprise leaving you with a positive feeling.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This stony caught my attention because of its popularity;. I found it to be excessive in the sex descriotions and rather thin narrn'ative.  I wouldn't classify it as great literature
B009C7JS14|2.0|It is a weather app. A lot of the time it is offline, doesn't update, and thus it is useless. I'm able to use other apps when this one is just staring back at me doing nothing. I've used it for a good long time, trust me this app is simply broken. Use something else.
0525953728|5.0|very good book . could not stop once i got started . i liked how he gave alot of back ground , how they got to that point. why they did what they did , how they where always training . to be the best
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I wasn't even sure what this did when I tried the free version. Just try it out, it more or less makes content available whenever you want it. Really good if you're a fan if Talk Radio. A great innovative app.
B005WQ4RP6|5.0|I enjoyed the re make of this movie as much as the original role played by Robert Mitchum.  Nick Nolte matched Gregory Pecks performance also, which was a surprise to me.  A plot of good versus evil rarely disappoints, and it sure didn't here. The supporting casts, directing,  set and camera work really added to the suspense of the movie.
0545101425|5.0|I couldn't wait for this one to arrive. The narrator is perfect and it puts you right in the action. You can visualize every place and person as she speaks. This series of 3 sets is really great and ill be listening to it over and over.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I bought if for a Christmas present so I can't speak to the quality, but it's supposed to be new, so I'm sure it will be fine.  I received it very quickly after I ordered it.
B00A861QMM|3.0|I usually buy all the G-5 games, most of them I give it 5 stars, but this one I can't. The graphics are not that great, it's hard to find most of the hidden objects even with the screen zoomed. I found the game to be boring.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I just can't get enough of Twilight!  I wish the series would just keep going.  I would recommend this book.
B005KDDUVS|3.0|Es un buen libro entretenido para leer en el verano, es de lectura amena y en algunas partes un poco aburrido
B002RXHW6S|5.0|Again, my son loves this bouncy house--easy to put together with the right kind of portable compressor--definitely recommend to parents.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|First rate fantasy. All hail Rothfuss!  Its a shame that most fantasy of today isn't as good as this is.
