B007SUW24W|5.0|He's just amazing. He has a gift of singing from his heart. His love songs are just so cute and simple. What a talented artist.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|It`s great to be able to wake up to a favorite song and to know it will be traveling with me!!!!!!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The old Weather Channel app used to be perfect on my Kindle Fire.  After the app changed it takes minutes to open...if it opens.  When checking the forecast I don't have time to force quit and restart.<br /><br />When it did work I did not like the new graphics and layout...very busy.  Using the old version it was much easier to see a lot of information at a glance.  I might have become accustomed to the new version if it would open every time!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Lee Child did it again!  A Wanted Man is classic Reacher, with twists and surprises that kept me reading late into the night. I'm always sad when I get to the end of one of Reacher's adventures.
0307592731|5.0|One of the best books I've read.  It's got every human condition you can relate to just sitting on your couch. Your heart swells when Cheryl accomplishes her goal.  A true gem!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Its great to play without ad videos popping up!<br />I am happy that it didnt cost any more money to have this game.
B0079XPUOW|1.0|More literary exercise than story, making the reading difficult and hard to connect with. Maybe I just don't like reading blog posts to begin with making the first coda torture to slog through. After that I skimmed forward hoping to encounter characters coming to realize their lives were ruled by space opera convention and deciding they weren't going to take it any more.
B004SBX112|5.0|Its great game to play and always a challange to play.<br />I like that its free after spending money on the HD version.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I have loved every book I've read by DB...wish there were more! I am often in the predicament of knowing the outcome long before I read it, but not so with his books.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I really enjoy this series. The acting and story line are great. I'm addicted. I even got my husband to watch and he likes it too.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really never do very good with these games.  However I have been able to really enjoy this one. Thanks!
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|speedy arrival and in great condition.  one of my all-time favorite tv shows- sucks how it never continue but I'm ok with that.  Thank you!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Can't wait for Season 4!! Thanks to Amazon Prime, we were able to watch the entire season in glorious HD!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This is one of the best products for the android that I have come across.  I am so very happy with it and use it all the time.
B000JML90Y|5.0|So glad I finally got to read this entire book.  I have read excerpts from it over the years, mostly in school.  It was so nice to finally get the complete picture.  Darwin was a genius!
B0073RSVMC|5.0|My 2 year old son loves dinosaurs and this one’s perfect because the jaws opens and he can pretend he’s eating.

B001AGXEAG|5.0|We bought this on our honeymoon last year, and watched it on the flight home.  What a great movie!<br />Hilarious, and so many jokes I did not catch as a kid!!! lol<br /><br />It has a great cast!  Check it out!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love this game but for some reason I'm not receiving my gifts I know I'm being sent some but they don't show up on my game
B00BUAEYVK|4.0|Not as good as some of the other Diehards but still entertaining.You can't beat him for action films.The introduction of his son was interesting and I hope he shows up again.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This. game is so great I love that it has cake in 0.7.1 virsion I can't wait til the next. update
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|Hans Zimmer is hands down the greatest movie scorer alive today.His action film scores in particular are incredible. I have every one he has ever written for the big screen and I listen to them over and over. Man of Steel is no exception as it captures the very escense and excitement of the film itself. Highly recommended.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Although this book takes a little effort to really get into, it is well worth it!!!  This is a beautiful story that really makes you think. Can't wait for the movie!!!
B00B6QXN56|5.0|I had never even heard of this guy until I caught this concert on PBS while channel surfing one night. I ordered this cd the next day. What an incredible talent he and his cohorts have.I'm getting ready to order some of his other cds soon. I loaned this cd to my daughter and she loved it also.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I haven't learned all I need to know about this app.  I wanted it to be able to carry with me instead of my larger heavier Bible, and know when I become more familiar with it I will be more than happy using it.
B00ATPVA78|5.0|This game took forever to load. But it was worth it. Game keeps me working my brain.<br /><br />Love it.<br />Lollipop. Lol lol lol
0062255657|5.0|This was a quick read--just a few hours, if that, engrossed in a world that Gaiman creates in this almost novella.  I had never read anything by Gaiman before and would be interested to purse that.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and understand why it hit #1 on the New York Times bestseller list the week it debuted.  Some very good books are coming out this summer of 2013.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved the plot of this book. It's very sad but one of the best books I've read in a while. John Green is an exceptional writer.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|great way to restart the series, with an excellent Doctor.  They finally tightened up the episodes to be 1 hour instead of 2 to 3 hours so a lot better pacing.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|One of the most beautiful and insightful books I've ever read.  Truly a masterpiece and a must read.  Can't recommend it enough!
B000P407K4|5.0|This is one of the funniest and greatest movies ever made a wonderful Peter Sellers makes this movie too much.  also cant forget slim pickens riding the a-bomb like a bronco.
B000ICXQII|1.0|So sorry I wasted my time with this. Would rather have spent the $3 on a parking meter. This movie looks like it was written, directed, and produced by a band of 12yo stoner kids. Everything in this movie was half-baked and it's release year is no excuse for the ridiculously bad effects. I have never been compelled to write a review, but I was shocked that something so bad had received so many glowing reviews. This movie left me with the sensation of having watched a meth addict try to convince me that he was making a playing card disappear by tossing it over my head. I hope that this review will save others a precious 1.5 hours. Better to take a nap. Better to watch an unplugged tv for that matter.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I wish I had seen this movie on the big screen so that I could have taken in the special effects.  True to the book, this movie is a nail-biting experience!  Jennifer Lawrence deserves the Oscar that she won for Best Actress - no small feat since expectations were so high from those who read the book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I received a Kindle Paperwhite for christmas and picked up this book on the recommendation of a podcast I regularly listen to.<br /><br />Luckily the job I work at, around christmas has lots of down time, because I could not put this book down.<br /><br />The opening chapter blew me away and I couldn't stop reading until I had finished all five books. This story is absolutely brilliant with twists and turns that you never see coming and characters you will fall in love with.<br /><br />If you enjoy and kind of sci-fi or post apocalyptic fiction, this book is absolutely for you.<br /><br />I keep hearing rumors that WOOL is getting picked up as a movie, I sure hope that's true because this book deserves all the exposure it can get.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Seasons 1 and 2 were free with my Prime membership.  Love the show and the quality of streaming is great.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|like the challenge ,only had my kindle fire for a couple of weeks, easy to use and navigate the menus
B0064MGU98|5.0|The show is great and the quality of streaming was great as well.  Plus it was free with my Prime membership!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is  fun, relatively easy game, with a goal for each level. Even though each level, you usually have enough time to finish before you time. Only negative about game overall is that it's over too soon. I finished in one afternoon.
B00004Y6OA|5.0|Sammy Hagar should have sang on this album along with Neil Peart on the drums and Geddy Lee on bass.
B005PK56TA|4.0|I feel that this is really superior television!  the actors were exceptional and the storyline kept you interested.  I really feel that the stars also stuck out and there were great cameos by a variety ot big name stars as well as the regulars who were at the top of their game.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|This series is a drama/thriller winner. It will engulf you with mystery and the story draw you to empathize with the lead character Will. Keeps you intrigued with each episode and wanting for more.
B005JE1KD8|5.0|Sheesh!  Robin Hobb's Tawny Man Trilogy is just brilliant.  I've read the Farseer and Liveship Traders series as well and I must say, does she never disappoint?  For anyone who enjoys a lyrical quality in the books they read and who is comfortable in immersing themselves in a completely imagined world, this is a lovely escape.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Story carries on from the first part quite cogently... dwells more than necessarily on Katniss' immature thoughts and longing to discover her purpose; but is a great read nevertheless...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is fun and a good way to stop all boredom for years to come as you can see it has over 1,000 downloads already... :) I say get it of you love horses and want to have a virtual one
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|It was ok, we expected it to be better so disappointed. John Goodman was quite the character in this one.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love this game. It's very engaging and I am hoping for more levels soon. Definitely worth the download. Not as easy as some of the other puzzle games which makes it all the more interesting.
0345803485|2.0|Loved the detail of the dom-sub contract, and it was at that point in the book that I thought it would take me down a fascinating road. Rather, the book gets bogged down in so much mundane detail that it became annoying to read. The author does throw you a hook to keep you reading, but what's at the end of that hook is a let-down. I found myself putting the book down to dream up my own plot twist that I was hoping to read. The author's premise of seeing a new world through an innocent's eyes would have fascinated the mostly \\"vanilla\\" readers she strives to appeal to. But that was a let-down too. Ana needed to do her \\"research\\" to learn about the life, as directed by Mr. Grey. I felt that the author should have done HER research because the dom-sub sex seemed disingenious, and, frankly, predictable. The first novel of the series was so drawn out that if it had been cut by 300 pages, the pacing would have been a much better read; however, it was obvious the author was aiming for a trilogy, and thus sabotaged the momentum.
B0086700CM|5.0|It is so fun because I like how they added the all the stuff it is so cool that is why they I wish they did a third one and you can make you own guy it is soooooooooooooooooooo cool and awesome on Kindle Fire
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I saw the movie first, and wasn't too excited to read the book. Boy was I wrong !  From the first chapter I was hooked. I devoured the trilogy. It was like the movie was an old silent black and white story. The book are 3D HD color, with so much more.....more character development, more intensity, more shades and nuances, just more story. So very good.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I loved this movie enough to buy it after seeing it in the theater.  That's not a common occurrence.<br /><br />I especially loved Javier Bardem as the villain. I also like that the movie stepped back from some of the electronics, and espoused the skills of the actual agent, James Bond.<br /><br />The movie did go on a little long, but I enjoyed it very much overall.
B00CF34B2I|3.0|Graphics are good.  Gameplay is good (if a bit slow).  Hard to read cards without double clicking on each of them.  My only real problem is that you can only play the first leg of the campain mode and one game on sealed deck mode.  Everything else is locked unless you purchase the game.  Don't call it a free app of the day (last week) if it isn't the full came unless you add lite or demo to the title.
B008220D5K|1.0|The main characters' problem is not that they are turning 40, it's that they are immature, self-absorbed, dishonest people who are incompetent at everything they do. The humor is sparse, sophomoric, and obvious.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|It's a great game will definitely recommend this game to all my friends<br />. Wish some of the times would be a little shorter tho
B0068FYZ84|5.0|We loved this DVD and hoped our grandkids would too. They had a hard time getting into it but my husband sat down with them and sort of narrated what was happening, they really got into it. Now they really like it and love singing and dancing with Farmer Hoggett and the little mice.
B0030IIYWA|5.0|the product arrive at excellents condicion
B005974CNA|4.0|A few thoughts here that don't seem to show up on any review I've seen:<br /><br />On The Backs Of Angels - A commentary on the downward spiral of our quote/unquote \\"leadership\\" which enjoys sacrifices beyond what they, or most of us on this medium will ever know.  A spiral now happening at an alarming rate.  \\"Tears fall from the shameless...\\"  Nancy (we have to pass the bill to know what's in it) Pineapple Pelosi anyone?<br /><br />This Is The Life - The song, and life itself IS a \\"gift divine\\". I'm thankful - even if you're not!<br /><br />Bridges In The Sky - This is obviously a follow-up to Scenes From A Memory, Metropolis Part II.  \\"With borrowed eyes...\\"  \\"Hidden memories flooding back...\\" etc.  I'm surprised it's not more obvious to the diehard fans.<br /><br />Breaking All Illusions - Rhythmically/Musically starts like Learning To Live.  Evolves to sound like a section in La Villa Strangiato by Rush and then has an Eric Johnson like sound.<br /><br />Beneath The Surface - This song is clearly about Mike Portnoy.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|LOVED, loved, loved it!!!!!  Highly recommend this to anyone, can't wait until season 4.  I wish it started today, right now.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This is a heart-wrenching story with characters that jump off the written page.  It's funny, sad, and wonderful.  As with most stories that are adapted for the big screen, this one needs to be read.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|Four score is how long it took me to finish this movie. It was so boring, so incredibly dull, that I fell asleep on two separate occasions (both in the middle of the day) while watching. Daniel Day-Lewis delivers a poignant performance but really the only redeeming thing about this movie is that it's fun to do impressions of Daniel Day-Lewis doing impressions of Honest Abe. Skip this film unless you suffer from insomnia.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|When I first saw Kevin Spacey in Wise Guy, I knew that he was going to be a huge star. And he has become one! Go Kevin!!!
B0069JBKHI|2.0|After a ton of research and deliberating I finally caved and dropped the $260 for this baby monitor. I was reluctant because of the price but also excited because it has a lot of features and is sold in Apple stores (so it has to be good, right?).<br /><br />First impressions - packaging is very nice, like an Apple product. Unit construction is more solid than I expected. Hinge has nice resistance to it and the unit is hefty, as expensive electronics should feel.<br /><br />Setup - Stick in battery, plug in, powered on, connected to my home network, linked to it via Bluetooth with my iPad3, no problem. Very simple.<br /><br />Desktop/browser viewer - Sorry, THERE ISN'T ONE!! After video quality this was probably my second highest 'want' in an IP cam/baby monitor. I saw posts online asking Withings for a desktop/browser app over a YEAR ago; they say it's \\"in the works\\" but they still don't have one! For $230+ you better have a desktop/browser viewer. Just ridiculous.<br /><br />Video Quality - In a word: bad. Over my very fast n-channel wireless home network I was literally getting 1fps. One. Frame. Per. Second. Trust me, I timed it. And the picture was hardly \\"HD\\". It was blocky and horridly rendered, looked like 256 color mode or something. I tested the monitor out in the same room as the router, and in various other rooms with no improvement.<br /><br />No worries, I'll try hard-wiring it with an Ethernet cable. Connected the cable, reconfigured the baby monitor to use Ethernet only. Video quality: still crap. Okaaaay. I closed the unit, removed the battery to force power cycle. Powered it back up: a little better. Picture was slightly clearer and was running at ~5-10fps, slightly better, but hardly smooth. Also, there is a full 2-3 second delay between real time and what the monitor registers. Eh, annoying, but I can live with the delay. However, the FPS is just atrocious! I even Googled example footage online to see if I just had a bad unit or not - the videos I found were a little better than what I was getting but not impressive (which I expected after dropping $230+ on a baby monitor!!). I messed with router settings, QoS, port forwarding, all with no improvement.<br /><br />I also tested the IR night vision in a pitch-black room and the video was exactly what you'll find online: very washed-out as if the subject was in a spotlight. Other cams (like the Foscams) provide a much less intense IR illumination and light up more of the subject with a softer, more uniform light instead of a spotlight.<br /><br />A bit of background info: I am a computer engineer by trade and also buy and review a fair amount of tech and gadgets on the side. Also, my home wifi network is running off a Netgear R6300 and with Comcast I typically get 30-60Mbps down/5-8Mbps upload, so I don't think my setup is the problem.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- good construction<br />- easy, simple setup<br />- lots of features: two-way mic, colored LEDs, plays music, humidity/temp sensor, movement and audio alerts<br /><br />Cons:<br />- video picture quality and FPS is VERY POOR, both over wireless and Ethernet<br />- NO DESKTOP APP/BROWSER VIEWER - cannot stress this one enough. I do not expect to solely check on my baby with an iOS device when I'm at home because of the battery drain, and because when I'm working I'll be on a desktop or my wife on a laptop. Withings has no excuse for not having a desktop app/browser viewer for this product, especially at the premium you pay for it (I mean, come on, I paid ~$200 for a solid wood crib on Amazon! The price is just absurd...).<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />Returning it and buying a Foscam FI8921. It is half the price, has pan/tilt option, better FPS, better video quality, better IR night vision, and has a browser viewer. I'm expecting setup with the 8921 will be a bit more intensive, but I will gladly spend more time getting it up and running than having to deal with the Withings baby monitor.<br /><br />There is aguy on youtube, channel name is \\"awkward hamster\\" that reviews and uses a number of Foscams with his Apple products and the FI8921 looks like a MUCH better, cheaper alternative.<br /><br />I will update this review when I receive and test out the FI8921. Wish me luck!<br /><br />***EDIT (7/16/13)***<br />Received Foscam FI8921 last night and tested it out: VERY impressed.<br /><br />Setup: popped in CD and loaded Mac software, connected 8921 to Ethernet and had fullscreen HD video on my Mac in about sixty seconds. Awesome.<br /><br />Video Quality: Excellent! Video is amazingly crisp and definitely 720 quality. Video gets a bit blurry when panning/tilting but instantly regains focus when cam is not moving. Latency is very good - no more than 1/4 to 1/2 second delay from real time to feed displayed on screen. I am extremely pleased!<br /><br />Web UI: the browser interface (which I am testing in Safari on Mac OS 10.8.something) is very intuitive, organized, fast and packed with features. You can do everything from change the cam network settings, control pan/tilt, activate two way mic, IR lights, reboot camera, etc.<br /><br />iPhone/iPad App: I have not had a chance to connect to the cam via iOS app yet so stay tuned.<br /><br />Wireless Setup: My cam shipped with Firmware version 1.1.1.10. After following the PDF guide and trying multiple times I could not get the cam to connect to my wireless network. I quickly found the Foscam support forums, downloaded the new firmware for the FI8921 (version 1.1.1.13) and (after two tries) got the cam firmware upgraded and rebooted. Tried to connect to wireless again: BOOM. Worked first time. Video quality/fps is exactly the same as when connected via Ethernet. I am extremely pleased.<br /><br />Conclusions: So far, the Foscam FI8921 is an exceptional product that meets all of my criteria for an IP cam/baby monitor: high quality video, high fps, night vision, good price, browser interface, iOS apps, remote login ability. I would highly, HIGHLY recommend it over the Withings, which is a definite rip-off.guy on youtube, channel name is \\"awkward hamster\\" that reviews and uses a number of Foscams with his Apple products and the FI8921 looks like a MUCH better, cheaper alternative.<br /><br />I will update this review when I receive and test out the FI8921.

B00AL6SM0S|5.0|When my baby boomer contemporaries were enthralled by the White Album, Sgt. Pepper, and the revolution those recordings portended, I was an adolescent nostalgic for the golden age of Wagner singing:  Flagstad, Melchior, and the Met in the 30's.  Had such a package been available then, I would have been enraptured.  At best I was tantalized by snippets of tapes passed from hand to hand.  I had no idea until this item was produced that such an archive existed.  Obviously with age even the greatest passions cool.  These are live broadcasts of the highest order in the equivalent of radio sound.  We ae fortunate to have them at all. I just wish I had had them sooner and at such a great price.  For example, in 1965 the EMI Furtwangler/ Fladstad Tristan cost $15.  This entire set was only $45 ordered from the UK.

B00A3NQNUU|5.0|this is a fun game that is seriously hard to put down. i play it all the time. its one of my favorite games.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|easy check-ins, quick posts, no need to sit in front of the computer or squint at a phone screen. like it
B0091REZMW|2.0|Most frustrating game ever. The idea is great, but you can only play for short bouts. You run out of energy very quickly and unless you buy more energy you have no choice but stop play. However, the worst part of this game is being able to keep yourself connected. It simply shuts down by itself randomly and you can log on again for several minutes sometimes hours. They should just upgrade their servers.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This games great for road trips  when you have nothing to do! : )<br /> It's so much fun and great for kids!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great game that really really makes you use your brain....good graphics too...thanks for creating a fun and doable puzzle game
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini is a great story teller and this novel is hard to put down. From his three novels I have learned much about Muslim and Afghan culture and tradition. And the Mountains Echoed setting is not limited to Afghanistan and covers three generations of families connected by an event that happens early in the novel. I highly recommend this novel as well as Hosseini's first two books.

B00BWBHIUG|4.0|love it, except for using so many have to buy pearls. lots of fun and I learn a lot.  pretty graphics too!
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|My only complaint about this game is that on a 7&#34; Samsung Galaxy Tab (first generation) the tiles are small and may not be good for those (like me) with vision problems although I was able to still figure out the tiles after a couple of rounds. Otherwise it's a great game!! Hopefully it will come to iOS system soon if it hasn't already.

B00DC7N9NS|3.0|It was a VERY Disney Oz. The animated parts were quite beautiful but they were Disney and not Oz. It was great Disney art but so very Disney.  I don't know about the story line... it was ok.  I wish they could have ACTUALLY used the Frank Baum novels and gotten some great ideas for a prequil to the Oz book but they decided to go with a lame broken heart theme and so it was disappointing and a flop for that reason.  It had a potential for greatness but didn't make it.  It was ok but not something I'd recommend paying to see.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|The initial scenes of the film are quite gripping and intense, which then gives way to a larger film about addicition.  Well acted and interesting, but as Denzel's character spirals downward, you feel like this movie should've been cut short.
B0049H9NVW|5.0|This game is simple to learn and difficult (for my little brain) to master. Definitely a game you can play with your 10+ kids too.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is unique, fabulous Sci-fy at its best and, sadly, it was cancelled after this first season. But watch it anyway. It is worth the romp through space and crazy old west environs. I understand there is a move that followed this because the fan base was so incensed the TV series was cancelled and they wanted some loose ends tied up. Do try this if you like Sci-Fy. Also, it is a wonderful assemble of actors.
B004UID2LC|5.0|With the youtube app, you can watch and search any videos you want! My daughter Amanda, who is 11 years old,  is always watching music videos of Metro Station, One Direction, Nicki Minaj, and other people. She is also always watching things like SoSoHappy short video clips and things like Littlest Pet Shop. In youtube u can also make your own account,  make videos or movies of ur own, and place them on youtube. Did I mention, on youtube u can also search real actual MOVIES and watch them.

And, yes, it is revealed in the first page or two that Enzo is dying. However, Enzo speaks to us about the \\"human\\" condition in ways that you will laugh and cry. Artfully written (I do believe they are attempting to make a movie of this), and probably the best \\"dog\\" book ever. Hold on though at the end. You will be amazed through your tears.
B005SHTXN0|5.0|I wanted my 14 year old to see it and It always delivers....amazing movie! Can watch it over and over...
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Khaled Hosseini is an amazing writer.  I am blown away by how wonderfully he can create his stories.  I loved it.
B00B5ACNRM|4.0|I was a little disappointed with this sequel but I still enjoyed it. I was mainly unimpressed with this version of the joker. I was expecting a better voice actor to play him but I guess DC was on a budget with their animated movies. I also felt that Batman wasn't as strong a presence as in the first one. I can nitpick all day but I think it is a film that is worth having to the dc animated collection.
B00B4804KS|5.0|If you have a 3D TV as well as an awesome sound system, this movie HAS to be in your library.  Awesome movie and the transfer to 3D was done very well.  Buy it, play it, and turn the sound way up for an amazing show.
B008220C56|4.0|First off... I love Joe Wright. From the beginning he's made interesting, visually original, very emotional pictures. He's not afraid to take a risk. It took me a bit (maybe 30 minutes?) to get used to his use of a surreal \\"theater stage\\" to tell this story, as well as some bizarre rhythmic, choreographed scenes, but once I realized what he was doing I got into this one as well. I can see where some/most? viewers could be put off, but to give an example: I rented \\"Argo\\" and \\"Anna Karenina\\" at the same time. While I thought both were great movies, \\"Argo\\" was more of a traditional, Hollywood type movie, glad I saw it - but \\"Anna\\" was so unique I will probably purchase this movie to see again and again for things I missed. Plus it rounds out my Joe Wright collection.. P.S. Great cast set bar, then Jude Law topped them all.
B009AP2G26|5.0|i love this show, gets you hooked, too bad the character playing finn passed away, next season should be pretty bittersweet. It was just getting good between him and rachel. :(
B0013UIUBC|3.0|No Reservations is okay in my opinion.  I liked other DVDs better.  I was glad to add it to my DVD collection.
0307950654|5.0|I love Jane Austin novels and P.D. James wrote a sequel to Pride and Prejudice that I thoroughly enjoyed! I would recommend this book to those who want the story of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy to continue!
B002SCKT0O|3.0|Junior was okay in my opinion.  I liked other DVDs better.  I was glad to add it to my DVD collection.
1781162646|5.0|I was concerned that this was going to be one of Stephen King's &#34;ehhh&#34; books.  However, there was nothing to be worried about.  It's gotten Stephen King's classic deep character development with relationship examining and a little spookiness as well.
1451696191|5.0|i have seen the movie at least 100 times and never get tired of it. as for the book it is almost like reading a different sourse of where the movie came from. it is good but i liked the movie alot more.there is so much differences .in the book. so i give the book a b . stick to the movie.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|This is Carolyn Reali's purchase, not Roy Reali's.  I liked the book very much. I'm looking forward to the sequel, if the price comes down.
630463949X|5.0|Awesome concert!  Unfortunately the last great concert on film that includes Christine McVie.  A real Gem!  Now if they would remaster it and put it out on blue-ray in 5.1.  :-)
B008C20TDG|5.0|Thank you so much for this great book. I have wondered for years what was wrong with me. I have done low calorie yoyo dieting for years and never been able to succeed with this lifestyle for myself or my family. This makes sense, I truly stay full with just the three recommended meals per day. No snacking necessary, my heaping plates of protein,fat and veggies would make anyone drool. I am so happy to be able to say goodbye to artificial, deadly sweeteners and starving myself. I am quickly shedding pounds which is wonderful but I can truly say this is more than just a fad diet, this is my new lifestyle. It is exciting to be making such a positive change for my family.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|I was very frustrated with my old calendar because i saw only dots when I had anything scheduled on that day. This app let me see exact event name on the calendar and I love the option to choose different color for every family member! The only problem I have so far is with synchronizing time. I use the app on my android phone and kindle and sometimes times for the events on both calendars don't match. I have to go to setting and synchronize calendar with the device. Maybe I do something wrong or maybe that has to be fixed. Otherwise I love the app!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is really awsome and fun and you should really play it if you haven't yet!! Everyone should play it!!
B00CL6HGIK|3.0|Predictable.  Storyline follows a formula that has work for Wahlberg over and over again.  Still a good movie to watch with a different finish.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I just love this series on the Clifton family.  I hope another pops up as the sad ending still leaves it open.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|Definitely worth the price.  Carries storyline forward with perfect continuity.  I will buy Season 6 also. I love this series
B008JFUR10|5.0|After a summer of disappointment from the summer blockbusters, I was looking to 'Pacific Rim' to salvage the mediocre offerings of May and June.  And it delivered in such a big way, it's mind-blowing.  \\"Pacific Rim\\" was absolutely riveting. Great director in Guillermo del Toro, great cast with the incomparable Idris Ilba in a starring role, finally. Fantastic special effects and a story that was easy to follow. Only negative was the bewildering talentless Charlie Day as a mega-geek researcher. So for everyone disappointed with 'Man of Steel', 'Iron Man 3', and 'Star Trek 2', treat yourself to a wild ride.
B0013GH9AO|5.0|I remember being in High School jamming to this album, and now 14 years later I own it again.  I guess I should probably do a better job of holding and backing up my collection, but I guess in my own argument I do make a bit more than I did in High School.
B008DVJMAW|5.0|Great CD, every song is a hit.<br />Looking forward to another CD from them.<br />Loved their performance on Palladia.<br />Awesome!
B004X6PRO6|5.0|The best book I've read in a long time! Really loved it. The mix of historical fiction with a very gripping story. Have already recommended to all readers I know.
B002VX3RCW|5.0|I would love to buy all the Lamaze products, they are great for babies... My son loves it, it's the perfect toy to take
B0050DIWFC|3.0|This is a decent read that goes into the courtroom drama and the turmoil a family goes through when charged with a crime. There could have been more depth to the character of Jacob especially considering how the story unfolds. This is not a gripping page-turner though it could have been made into one. Still a good read.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|This game is so much fun, with the gopher and if you pop him on the head you get extra points.  Just a fun all over game to play.
B001DUDKEY|3.0|I enjoyed it because it's a wonderful story, but I have seen better versions.  But...if you've never seen it or read it, I highly recommend that you do.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|I saw this concert when I was probably nine or ten the first time and recorded it on VHS.  I watched it time and time again and somewhere along the way the VHS disappeared so I was thrilled to find this concert on DVD.
B00005QGAT|5.0|Out of all of Michael Jackson's albums, THIS is the one that rates, for me, as being the best he ever had!  I don't know...maybe it was the collaboration of Quincy Jones and Rod Templeton, or maybe it was Michael himself, or maybe it was the magic involved.  Who knows...maybe it was all three.  The truth of the matter is that I played this disc 3 times straight in my car and I loved every moment, along with each and every song...PRICELESS!!!  It's having a cd like this that makes one wish for the art of having real music again.  Michael, we miss you totally and will always have this recording in our memory banks, along with our collection.  WE LOVE YOU MICHAEL...ALWAYS AND FOREVER!!!!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|We have so enjoyed this series . Great acting and the stories keep you wanting more. You would think this was an ALan Sorkin series like West Wing.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|The game is fun.<br />Sometimes there are glitches and they do get recognized and other times they Don't.<br />For the most part the game is enjoyable. Try it an see what you think..enjoy.
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|photographic study of babies and their mother, very intresting and clear photos in a good binding and cd attached gift
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I have read the whole series but this one is the jewel of the three.  This reminds me of when I was reading the Lord of the Rings series.  I got so wrapped up in their world that I hated to put the book down.
067144901X|5.0|This book is a must have for your little ones.  I have been extremely satisfied with every Boynton book I have ever purchased.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|The difficulty comes with the pain the main character suffers in this book.  I would recommend this book highly.  The book still comes to mind at times and I actually think I will read it again. (I hardly ever read books twice!)
B006Y5EDRG|4.0|I really like the story line.  Love Debra Messing.  It is a little risque for a young teen.  The music is great.  I guess it could be called &#34;the adult 'Glee'.&#34;
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I really didn't enjoy this book.  I couldn't even finish it.  I guess I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to books.  The writing needs to be up to a certain level of professionalism for me to enjoy reading it.  This writing was too amateurish for me.
B00DHNAQ2Y|5.0|A very enjoyable film, it follows a similar storyline as the original, with a more serious plot and offers horror fans something new for 2013, outside of zombie and slasher flicks. Though I still enjoy the original more, due to the humor.  I think this is a nice modern remake, worth a second watch.<br /><br />Robert K.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  I love it when a writer keeps me guessing about how it will end.  This one did just that.
B00542USJW|5.0|how can you not like this film? michael jordan? bugs bunny? this is the 90s film that was fun for the whole family.
B00BNGFGIQ|1.0|I wish I could say more about this app, but I never could get it to open. Whenever I tried to launch it, it would crash and force close.  unInstalled.
0060574216|4.0|this was a very informative book for me. I was going through some difficulties understanding the opposite sex after a personal event and this actually helped me greatly.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great in every way. Disappointed in season 3 ending though...a bit much after such a huge investment in this story line
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|where do I start. this is just a great movie for all ages. it's got a great story that even the most cynical will melt to. you won't regret it.
B009LXEBD4|3.0|The CD was fine.  The case was cracked though.  Other than that, everything was fine and played with no problems.
0385349947|4.0|i've heard so much about this book as a male that I finally read it. it's a great book to follow for equality of the sexes and I think if people were more open minded it would help society in general.
B0043KK4N6|3.0|The CD was fine.  The case was cracked though.  Other than that, everything was fine and played with no problems.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|Great game.! One of the best I've played..good job....maybe more places to fight but over overall very nice...please make it easier for credits, once you have to use your ammo like bazooka can't push on.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I loved it soooo much!!!!!!!!<br />It is my favorite book series in my life so far!!!!<br />They should make more movies
B0027MJU00|5.0|Dark Places was filled with twists and turns and unexpected characters, it had me hooked. I've read Sharp Objects and Gone Girl, both from Gillian Flynn and just like those, i was not disappointed. I'd definitely recommend this for everyone to read.
B00400NHRO|5.0|Very funny and equally poignant. Definitely recommend to those in healthcare and beyond. I laughed out loud more than once.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I love Holmes for Holmes' own sake, and I think this series does a good job of capturing the spirit of the character. But the finale--WOW. Irene Adler was cast perfectly, particularly for this iteration of her character. Some purists may not like the way it was done, but I thought it was spectacular.
B007SN2FCS|1.0|Absolutely the WORST purchase ever... do NOT buy this cloth book. It only contains 3 pages of the original book. For ~ $14 it is a total ripoff.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Great game I love it and so do my kids and I don't have to worry about in app purchasing its great
B000NY12LO|5.0|This book was very well written (as most Picoult novels are) with such a good message.  I think all of us have know a &#34;Peter Houghton&#34; at one time or another.  Hopefully this book will make people think before they are quick to judge someone else and/or even make fun of them. Even though this book is fiction - it probably has more truth in it than you realize!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Easy and fast read. Take you into another world that's not yours. Good book for the beach or a trip.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|I LOVE IT!!!! I WAS SORRY TO SEE THAT &#34;MACGYVER&#34; WAS NO LONGER ON THE AIR.....BUT WHEN I SAW THIS ON &#34;PRIME INSTANT VIDEO&#34; I JUMPED AT THE CHANCE TO WATCH IT& I'M STILL WATCHING!!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I LOVE this game it's so fun but you have to buy the full one it's so fun and challenging!!!
B006DRVFRQ|4.0|I thought Google Reader shut down on July 1? Not sure why this app is still available. I certainly liked this app while it was working, though have happily moved on to Feedly.
B005LAIGPA|2.0|it seems that the seller didnt fully watch the product he sold me because it froze on me and wouldnt let me watch 30 seconds of the movie. But after grabbing some silver cream and filling and scratches though there shouldnt of been since it was being sold as new by the seller but thats another story it fixed it and is now watchable.I think it might have been a simple mistake. But be cautious when buying from this seller.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I don't know if this is the first or the second in the series, but either way this trilogy (which hopefully will be completed soon-fingers crossed) was very original and surprising.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|What a great show I feel lucky to have found it on my kindle  refreshing and non violent will watch all the episodes
0789318245|5.0|Beautiful book with classic ink by the 'who's who' of original tattoo artists. Worth having on your shelf for sure.
B0090KZDSK|4.0|while reading it i found it kept you interested, and it had other factors to the story other than just their romance, but the book just ends in the middle of a scene, its almost as if the author cut the book in half, it was frustrating as we waited long enough to read this part of the series for it just to be cut.
B005DD7H50|4.0|Good movie to sit and relax ... Best enjoyed on home theater with coke and popcorn ... worth every penny!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun I love it. I play it all the time before I go to bed it's awesome!
B0088WFZQG|4.0|watch it for the action episodes. makes you feel like you are actually playing a HD graphic game like battlefield..!!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I thought it was really exciting but the end was kind of  boring I hope book 2 will be awesome
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I truly enjoyed Clare's 1st of the trilogy. Much more exciting than Twilights' and twisty love story. I just wish chapters were shorter for my sporadic reading times. Looking. Forward to the movie coming it in August!
0525425772|3.0|The latest Theodore Boone novel, The Activist has Theo Boone tackling a city bypass. For me, this one wasn't as good as the others. The bypass part was heavy handed. There was some attempt to be fair and even, but it still came across as one sided. Half the fun of the Theo Boone novels is not making them quite so heavy.
B00BCZU8WM|2.0|I was so bored listening to this album.  It is a 10 song album of midtempo numbers that all seem to convey the same message: \\"girl I wanna get with you.\\"  I am experiencing serious buyer's remorse.  I usually love his music, but I guess I just wanted him to take a bigger chance.  Lesson learned.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game has great graphics and is a lot of fun!  I am a Kindle user and I recommend this game.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|Their best work yet. great lyrics/arrangements. one of the best contemporary albums around. very theatrical. love it, love it, love....
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|One episode and you're hooked.  Can't wait until Season 2 in 2014. Hurry back, Ragnar! There are villages to pillage.
B003IKMR0U|4.0|This is a fun game and its pretty simple.  Its not a thinking game, and you can win in literally 2 mins or less, depending on how lucky your rolls are.  Its good for my 7 yr old and I to play and it also gives her the sense of playing some games, without having to dive into a 30-60 minute board game when no one else is in the mood to play.  It'd be better if this included some way to keep score... and I don't mean a piece of paper and a pencil.  Something reusable... like a sliding dial that keeps track of the number of brains you have eaten.  Its pretty expensive just for some dice, but Steve Jackson games are generally cheap in the sense that they lack score keeping materials in the non-deluxe versions of the games (for example, Munchkin).
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Clay Jannon (Web designer) finds a job as the night clerk at Mr. Penumbra's 24-hour book store. Or is it something more than a quiet bookstore? Eclectic clientele trickle in on rare occasion, piquing Clay's interest almost as much as the mysterious books in the 'tall stacks' towards the back. Clay's curiosity leads him down the road towards a mystery hundreds of years old, a mystery he is uniquely positioned to investigate.<br /><br />I'm a programmer and a gamer. I work in the tech industry. For me, this book - despite being set in the present, and fiction rather than sci-fi or fantash - was as good as it gets. The writing is engaging, the audiobook narration (the way I consumed it) excellent, and the story is terrific! Google plays a prominent part, but along the way we also find out a bit about the world of the web, fonts, the history of book publishing, and computer graphics.<br /><br />This is easily the best book I've read this year. It's a touch short - more of a novella than a novel - but wonderful. I foresee re-reading it sometime soon. Five stars!
1451626088|4.0|Having read so many books on the Cousins' War, it was hard to read one that ends before the war does. But I understand that she was limited to the timeline of Anne's life. Not my favorite PG book, but still good. She doesn't do bad work.
B004RJMUJO|3.0|Great mindless fun<br />My 2 year old grandson and I both enjoy playing this game.  It helps pass the time when you need just something mindless to do/.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love this app, works great.  No problems.  Loads when needed and keeps me up to date on my Facebook Friends
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|I also jumped into this bandwagon and got this [[ASIN:B00BNGFGIQ Chimpact]] game to find out what this Monkey Business is all about. I am happy that I did. It was a pleasant surprise to see this game which worked really well and proved to be very enjoyable. The graphics and presentation is superb so are the monkey sound effects. The game is rather large to download and there is no provision to move it off to the SDCARD but other than that minor issue the game has been a hit in our home. The game has that perfect balance of difficulty & progresses nicely as you advance in levels. There are also some difficult timed levels that one can attempt after you have mastered the monkey business on your tablet.<br /><br />For mere 99c and excellent replay value and a various modes of play I can clearly see a winner here if you like playing with a bunch of jumping monkeys on your tablet. Four stars from me.
B004J64QSI|5.0|If you are a Les Mis fan, this is an outstanding production and the sound is in most ways superior to the Movie and, to an extent,  Original Broadway recording.  Javert turns in a brilliant performance especially.  Excellent addition to any collection.
034580404X|5.0|I really enjoyed the three books, thinking about reading them  again.  The first one and second one were the best.
B00846REIS|5.0|I have now read the Crossfire Novel 2x and I am thinking about a 3rd time!! They are faboulous!!!!! NEED BOOK 4 LIKE NOW!!!!
B009WUAK2M|3.0|The first &#34;Expendables&#34; was much better.  The story line for 2 was overkill to highlight all the big named actors.  Arnold didn't need to be in the movie at all; his part was superfluous.  Van Damme was great as the bad guy; very good at portraying evil.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I have now read the Crossfire Novel 2x and I am thinking about a 3rd time!! They are faboulous!!!!! NEED BOOK 4 LIKE NOW!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It kept me on the edge of my seat, I could not stop reading it. There was so much suspense and frightening scenes in the story it was wild to learn what happened next.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I have now read the Crossfire Novel 2x and I am thinking about a 3rd time!! They are faboulous!!!!! NEED BOOK 4 LIKE NOW!!!!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is very fun and very addictive.  It's definitely good to have when you're trying to kill time or just relax.  I like that you don't run out of lives like most games these days.  The only con that I would have would be I wish the city would change more often.
B007SGM084|5.0|I began reading this trilogy expecting to dislike it. After finishing it for a third time, I can officially say these books are among my favorites. I was told that the books were raunchy and rather inappropriate, but, honestly, I have seen worse in rated r movies. I really love this story line and truly hope that Ms. James will follow through with writing the story from Christian's perspective! If you are looking for a good love story and don't mind some descriptive details in places, I highly recommended this trilogy!
B00992CF6W|5.0|to get diamonds and gold under spawn use the seed:  i like pizza. if don't believe me check youtube. jackfrostminer.
B005N4F48Q|5.0|A great depiction of the accounts of the 3 day battle at Gettysburg.  Incredible performances. A must see for young and old.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game, it is very fun. I just don't understand were the little girl that you fight comes in.<br />  I LOVE DESPICABLE ME!!
1592407889|5.0|What an idiot that Shirley is; I think she is a real whack job. I feel so bad for her daughter; not even helping her through college;what a horrible selfish person she is. A real snob too; this old biddy has it coming to her in the next life; someone is waiting for her with a pitchfork. I hope Sachie is able to make a little money off this book; her mom will never leave her a dime; she will leave it to some new age idiot.
B00CITOS4A|5.0|I adored the style of this book, very witty and a great insight into professional photography and the printing of photos.
1936594234|5.0|Powerful.  This is one book I plan to read and re-read.  Such insight given by Mr. Murphy chapter after chapter!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I love JFK history, both fiction and non-fiction. I received this as a Christmas gift, and I started reading in the Spring. It was a long book, but it kept my attention the entire time. The character of Jake was so well thought out and he was just someone you wanted to keep reading about. Not too much back story on him, but enough that you wanted to follow him in his journey with Al. I loved the whole story. I loved when he became George, and his story with Sadie, Harry, and all the characters in between. I can't say enough about this book, it truly became one of my favorites. I enjoyed Stephen King's writing so much, I couldn't believe this was the first book of his I had ever read. Just amazing.
B000FC1MCS|4.0|This book helped me to understand the mind of an autistic person which was very important to me as the future step-parent of a child with PDDNS (pervasive development disorder non-profit).  The book did a fantastic job of illustrating the unconditional love and hope of a parent of a child who cannot convey love or affection in return (as their condition makes it  impossible).
B005LJKEXS|2.0|it's quality build, price is ok, but it not work for my webcam,i think for usb 2.0 the length can not over 16ft
B00AKFG15S|4.0|also well written and had to be read if the first 2 books were read. Now we need the next episode.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|This is a great movie and very funny. Me and my 4 year old have watched it sevearl time and still love watch n it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very fun. Better than temple run a easy gamed big idea<br />Love  it awesome game<br />Super duper fun and awesome game
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a good app  despicable me is my 2nd favorite  movie thank you for making this app who ever did
B0096DZKZC|5.0|Episode 3 is hard with metal sonic. I didn't even finish the first level. It was very hard. But still a pretty good game.
141694737X|5.0|I had this book in my classroom many years ago. I taught preschoolers and kindergarteners. It was always a big hit. Guessing what zoo animal was in the container was great fun. This board book edition is wonderful for three year olds and up. It one they want to read over and over.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I TRIED this on hard mode with the fog on but I lost easily as soon as I went into that house. I saw him right behind me. But there is one thing you should fix. This is very close to the one on PC except when you start and you walk a few inches away from spawn, he's right behind you. I didn't even collect a page yet.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I am glad I got this. My touch screen is hard to type on and this made it so much easier. Worth the money.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is great it is fun and a little challenging so it makes it addicting it's free two thumbs up!!!!!!! :)
0375703861|4.0|Good book, but it wasn't what I was expecting...which was better! Hopefully, the next books I read of hers will  be better...
B009XIXVU6|2.0|Not a good flow. If one puts book down for couple days one had forgotten how one story ties into another. Found it confusing. Not a smooth read!
B00CXL6XP0|3.0|This sounds much better than their more recent music.. almost a return to their sound in the late 80s/early 90s. Definately a good effort. New vocalist is fantastic. Wish the songs were longer and that the songs were more \\"powerful\\". Good stuff otherwise.  3 and a half stars.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Great alternative to the $27 pc  version but with some down sides<br /><br />Pros<br />&middot; Good Graphics<br />&middot;Fun<br />&middot; Great  time spender<br /><br />Cons<br />&middot;Not as many mobs<br />&middot;Not as many Block<br />&middot;Not as many Biomes<br />&middot;Only provides Creative ,Survival , and Realms
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Great tree story. Keeps you interested and wanting to read more. I was disappointed in the ending, but can't wait for more Eva and Gideon.
B005EVVESM|5.0|i enjoy this CD for the music.  I like Marron 5's new music and I hope they keep coming out with this kind of music.
0375805613|4.0|as described works well on time in good condition no problems with product use as intended 18 words is too much to require
B00BIVN82M|5.0|I enjoy this CD for the music is great.  Michael is so good at what he does and I love that he sings a lot of the oldies with a new flair,  Good dance music.
B004HD61KE|3.0|A Fun, light read, good for the beach or just winding down and escaping. Cool premise. The Sigma Force once again Triumphs over evil to save mankind.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Super fun, no permissions, great graphics. The sound effects are cute and not annoying. Great for kids and adults. Worth the download.
B00C2C637I|5.0|I have read Bradbury's short stories, and am amazingly blown away by how this quickly became one of my top 5 books of all time! I have been an avid reader for a good 16 years, reading a wide variety of books and novels. The way this story is written, combines poetry, horror, wonder , drama, and fantasy, as every word, is perfectly orchestrated! A true Masterpiece!!!!
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Fun game. Well thought out except you have no idea what to do when you first start to play. A short tutorial level would be nice. Graphics, sound are excellent. Nice work, Yippee.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved this book one thing though I wished they talked more at bear this was an amazing book and I WONDER what's next
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|I can't stop listening to this album.  Every song is engaging and fun.  I can't get the song &#34;Wagon Wheel&#34; out of my head!
B008645YEE|5.0|Hans Zimmer once again does not disappoint with this soundtrack! He continues to show that he can deliver on any stage at any time no matter what! if you loved the movie then you'll absolutely adore the soundtrack!
B007HC3LHS|4.0|Good, but not great. It was a little confusing at times to go back and forth from past to present, but also kind of necessary to show that the past was still a very big part of the character's present. The ending was pretty predictable, but the overall story is good.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is the best game in the history of games. it should be called the best game in the world
B00C7DGQ9C|4.0|nice action scenes and slightly funny dialog that make the movie a bit better. they did well with the gore scenes but dont expect too much action like avengers or bourne.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|If you watched the movie and thought it was okay, read the book, it is brilliant. the movie barely touches on the plot. Don't get me wrong, I think the actors were pretty and did okay - and personally I love Donald Sutherland. he's got the sexiest voice. if I could have him as my satnav voice i'd be forever in my car driving around - but I feel the movie would have been truer to the book if it were handled by Peter Jackson of &#34;lord of the rings&#34; fame who did a brilliant book to movie adaption. in the movie, it looked although Peeta was faking his feelings to get through the games. the book was far better. when I finished reading this book, I went straight to amazon and bought the other two books and was not disappointed in the whole trilogy. can't wait to read it again... and again... and again...
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|the animation is top notch, very creative and current.  A bit scary for my 3yr old, borderline for the 5yr old, and about right for the 7yr old.  Didn't have to explain too much to her - ha.
B00AE4OGCU|4.0|pretty good reading. the last book seems to go on a little long but the first book in the series was just unput-downable.
B002N44XSG|5.0|Every Percy Jackson book is great. Thanks Rick you have done a great job writing this book.<br />Good job Rick
B005HEPN06|1.0|Playback kept sticking and stopping. Unable to restart it. Tried restarting episode, playing from resume, to no avail. Would've liked to see it.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|after 50 shades, this is the next great series to go to...<br />nice easy pace, keeps you reading along quickly.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|My daughter loved it. There fifth grade principal recommended it and it was great!<br />I like how there is precepts and how the book taught her a lesson. She also enjoyed how the author never really told what August looked like she only gave hints.<br /> I would recommend this to fourth graders going into fifth grade.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is one of the best escape games I have played. I like the different things you can do and the many rooms to go into.
B009JBWOU0|4.0|I am not a big superhero fan but I actually had to watch the first two for a class (weird I know).  The first two weren't that great to me, but the last one I actually stayed awake for.  Not bad Batman. Not bad at all.
B008XGW1CI|5.0|If you're expecting Harry Potter you won't like this.  The only obvious similarities are fantastic writing and expert character development.  These characters are all flawed but you like most of them anyway and care about what happens to them.  It's truly a stunning and profound book if you stick with it for the first few chapters.  It might seem cynical but it's full of hope and redemption as well.  One of the best books I've read in ages!
B003UESJEM|5.0|I love tommy lee jones so I am bias towards anything that he is in.  I loved it. Recommended by me.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Having already watched the show, I knew what was going to happen, but it was still a very worthwhile read. There are many small points and descriptions that work better when written. Martin manages to make the character's motivations and pasts more real and complete than HBO's series ever could.
B006LSZECO|4.0|this book was a grabber!  It pulled me in and held my attention to the end.  the twists and turns kept me from predicting the end.  A frightening ending; surely not possible in the &#34;real world.&#34;
B0034G4P80|5.0|Its worth it to see Chris with the lowest hiphuggers ever. You go boy. If the movie was just that scene I would have still bought it.
1451695195|1.0|I got lost in the words of this experience. I am a medium and have an understanding of life after death and NDE. The author should stick with his MD. Not a good reading experience.
B0012Q732O|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. The graphics/CG were very well done, but not overwhelming. Worth the money. Simple but pleasent story line.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Great book, but I get mad when I don't like the ending and right now, I'm mad. I also thought this was a trilogy.....
B005CGI4EG|5.0|The first is 3rd rock from the sun. I adore the show but my favorite episodes are with Al and his best bud Jefferson.
B00ALQSNV6|3.0|Not bad, but as i said this is one of those faux-documentaries. A little science mixed heartily with speculation and sensationalism, for the sake of a plot I guess.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|It has disappeared and not downloaded anywhere This is the 3rd time an amazon rental has done that and I cant get my money back
B00B6DTWM2|5.0|Great new horror movie. Edge of your seat from the very beginning. A must see.  Should be watched at night to get the most enjoyable experience. Highly recommend.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This works great and I would recommend this to anyone.  It does it's job and that's all I care about.
B0063IH60K|5.0|easy to use and have enjoyed it so far as put it on so that would have something to do on the airplane as have not totally figured out how to use the Kindle to its fullest yet
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If you like running and despicable me, you need this game. And he best part is, its absolutely free. Thanks Gameloft for.making this teat game.
B008P9M614|5.0|Just wish they would have released a blu ray bundle for the whole show. Other than that great value for the price. All the discs were there and some do have special features
B0095G5AFU|5.0|This app is perfect for my middle of the night thoughts that just have to be written down. All I need is my charged Kindle Fire and I'm writing like a fiend without waking up my husband or having to get out of bed.<br /><br />There are many great features: titles for each &quot;chapter&quot;, choosing which font size I'd like, table of contents created as I go, spell check, ability to email my work to my computer, create a notebook for anything I want or need, and most important is the convenience of having it at my finger tips day and night!
B00CATSONE|5.0|I've been wanting to learn about Tesla for a long time & finally got around to it.  For some reason I was worried that a Tesla biography would be over my head, so was a little nervous.  The fact that this book was so short (it took me about 30 minutes) and so well written, was calming.  Lots of info in such a small amount of time.  I feel like I'm now ready to move on to a more elaborate biography.
B008JEJO88|5.0|The fit of these crocs were perfect.  I normally were a size 10.5 but the size 11 was perfect.  They are very comfortable so I wear them daily.  The color scheme is live but not loud.  very up-to-date.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Works as it should and is soooooo long.  Perfect for lonely nights with a book, I can curl up in bed and not worry about huddling near the wall jack.
B003G4W49C|5.0|First time I read this was back in high school.  I decided to read it again (cuz it was a daily amazon deal).  Twenty years later I read it again and it means more to me especially as an army officer; learned a few on how to live my life and how I should raise my own two children.  Maybe not the same for you; you be the judge.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I like it so far!! I'm only on level 4 but I do like that I can play my sister on Facebook!!! We hadn't seen each other in 4 years...but we can play the game we used to back in the day!!!
B007EW9ISM|3.0|Purchased this because a friend has one and raved about it.  It is nice but just not for me.  It was way too fat for me and awkward to hold.  You also had to press down hard in order to write.  I have heard many people love it and it seems to be a good product, but just be careful if you are picky like me
B0055G9L9U|5.0|Used prime forever - and this show is absolutely funny.  I recommend to most - does go a little over the top at times wiht the &#34;anti-god&#34; sentiment, but overall it's very hillarious.<br /><br />First time watching/streaming were some issues but overall comparable to Netflix playback.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Like a call of duty for smart phone but better! With multiplayer or single player options and many customizable weapons and many other features!
B000PUV1ZI|4.0|This movie brings a new take on the old Peter Pan Dustin plays Hook to the tee wonderful performance and great acting
B0040UEI6I|5.0|No pianist (except possibly Wuehrer) was as great on Beethoven as was Hans Richter-Haaser; so, this set, at this price, is a stellar steal, and a must-have.<br /><br />The craggy, monumental, style of Hans Richter-Haaser on Beethoven conveys to the utmost the emotional world of these noble masterworks. Each of these performances out-does even such master-pianists as Walter Gieseking, Wilhelm Backhaus, Wilhelm Kempff, and Erik Then-Bergh. With Wuehrer, it's a toss-up; he was astounding. However, if your tastes don't incline toward the way those pianists performed Beethoven, then the recordings here will probably not impress you either, because Richter-Haaser's Beethoven is firmly and unmistakably in that tradition: distinctively Germanic, serious, and reverential of Beethoven, not \\"colorful,\\" but deeply respectful of the music. (The difference between Wuehrer and R-H is the difference between Austria and Germany; Wuehrer combined exquisite grace with his awesome power, while R-H was instead craggy.)<br /><br />These performances are decidedly cool, with no intention to achieve their effects via racing the music or being \\"zippy,\\" but instead to involve the listener in Beethoven's musical trance. Pianists who emphasize instead the purely theatrical aspects of these scores are in a different world and tradition.<br /><br />The selection of sonatas here includes the greatest sonata, #31, given a Brucknerian performance, 100% trance. Also included are Sonatas #s 1, 2, 3, 16, 17, 18, 22, 26, 27, 29, 30, 31 (as mentioned), and 32, plus Diabelli Variations, and Concerti #s 3 (with Giulini), 4 (with Kertesz) and 5 (with Kertesz, almost as terrific as R-H's recording of that with Sanderling, and the sound is a bit better here, this being a studio recording). Also included are some short piano pieces.<br /><br />The greatest Beethoven sonatas until the last four, #'s 29-32, are on a separate Philips set by R-H, which includes the four most popular (and four of Beethoven's greatest) sonatas, #'s 8, 14, 21 & 23; plus (as filler on CD2) it has #'s 24 & 28, no concerti. That one is also a must-buy: [[ASIN:B000001333 RICHTER HAASER PLAYS BEETHOVENS SONATAS Philips]]<br /><br />For my tastes, R-H was tied with Wuehrer as the greatest of all pianists on Beethoven; but if a listener likes the Beethoven style of the pianists who are popular, then this set will probably disappoint, and might even come across as boring.est) sonatas, #'s 8, 14, 21 & 23; plus (as filler on CD2) it has #'s 24 & 28, no concerti.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The game brings back the minions of despicable me. And shows us their cool.And its like subway sufers.That's my opinion
0060245867|5.0|You cannot go wrong with any \\"If You Give...\\" book, but the first is my favorite. Numeroff's story is sweet and silly, funny and charming, but what really make this book so well-loved by so many children and adults is the magic that is Felicia Bond's illustration. The whole becomes greater than the parts when an excellent storyteller is teamed with an excellent illustrator.
086571701X|4.0|Sylvia goes into full detail of everything you need to know about aquaponics.  Her summary at the end of every chapter for a quick review was very helpful.  If you are wanting to start an aquaponics garden, I would definitely have this in my library.

B005LJITS0|4.0|I don't care what anyone says! This movie had such bad reviews and I never saw why. I saw this in the theaters and had to watch it again. Ryan Reynolds does a great job as Hal Jordan and the special effects are sweet. Green lantern has always been my favorite superhero and if he is yours too, you should find that this movie is great! Just like I did :)
B009LQKHIO|5.0|This is a well written story that flows easily. Good dialog, believable characters and such fun to read. It was relaxing and interesting. Please read and enjoy!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|... very badly!!!<br /><br />What a shame!<br /><br />please bring back the previous version... it was very useable.  This one is a nightmare.<br /><br />Thanks!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|As a former middle school teacher, I can't say enough good things about this book.  I have always enjoyed reading children's literature, and frankly feel sorry for the people who don't.  But anyway, Palacio does such a good job with relating what it's like to be a middle school student.  I laughed.  I cried.  I learned a couple valuable lessons.  What else could you ask from a story?  Especially one that can help shape our youth.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Read it. Give it a chance. All will be revealed. And the twists were unexpected. Don't you love it when you don't see it coming? Being able to read from the perspectives of the husband and then the wife was engaging.I started picking sides early on. Enjoy.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|If this book doesn't bring a few tears then I don't know what would. It is very well written and plays on your emotions.
B0014BY72Q|1.0|It was unusual for Amazon Prime Instant video, but this purchase would not load with Roku.  It kept timing out.  We switched to watching in Windows 7 (using the Chrome Browser), but that too stopped several times during the movie to reload.  I suspect infrequently watched videos may be on lower performing servers.
B000002GXJ|5.0|For some reason, it looks like your buying the double (fat jewel case) from the 80's, but your not, you actually get it in a nice slim case. it sounds great and my only complaint is that it should've been longer! all the songs sound really good, my favorite has to be \\"take it to the limit\\" which was sung really well,all in all i'm glad it's the newer version, from I think was 2005? not really sure. I hope they release this again someday with more songs, anyway i'm happy with it!
1620402963|4.0|Finished in a weekend. Moves apace and rarely turns laborious. Thought-provoking plot offers an interesting glimpse into an often overlooked portion of antebellum WWII Europe and US.
B000KIPT30|1.0|the unit crapped out after a couple months, i was getting static most of the time, it can be fixed by pushing in all the connectivity but then will get staticy again. The integrated drive in the PC pushes about the same power as this unit, so i barely noticed the difference.
B00A7W29BE|4.0|A useful app that would be made considerably more valuable if it could OCR documents that are scanned. As it is, it is a substitute but not a replacement app for other options, including Acrobat.
B009GX69RK|5.0|this show is absolutely hilarious!!!! zooey deschanel is awesome in it.  for those of you who like quirky but hilarious shows such as parks and recreation or the office, i would highly recommend this show!
0393338827|4.0|Written by Michael Lewis (Moneyball author), this is a book about the financial crisis of 2007/8/9. Lewis was in the financial industry in the 80s and wrote a book about it - Liar's Poker - so he knows of which he speaks.<br /><br />Lewis charts the buildup to the crash following some of the few people who bet on it - and thus against the US economy, the financial industry and American homeowners - and made a lot of money in the end. These are our protagonists.<br /><br />He reveals a system that was hugely corrupt and incredibly greedy. The greed is what is most striking. I thought I knew how greedy Wall Street was, but it's a lot worse. In a nutshell, as I think I understand it, the big investment banks took advantage of inept ratings agencies (Moody's, S&P, Fitch), that enjoyed sort of a gentleman's agreement among all involved that they would be the final arbiters of risk among financial products. If these guys said a particular investment was AAA (no risk) versus B- (high risk), its price reflected that, and no one dug any deeper. And so the investment bankers packaged subprime mortgage (highly risky, of course) into bonds and got the ratings agencies to rate these bonds as AAA - essentially risk free, and priced accordingly. If the mob did it with cash it would be called laundering.<br /><br />Anyway a couple of smart guys (our protagonists) saw through this house of cards and discovered a way to short the entire enterprise by purchasing insurance against these mortgages defaulting, in the form of credit default swaps. So they would pay a premium for the \\"insurance,\\" with the goal of collecting the payout when the subprime mortgages all went belly up, which they knew was just a matter of time.<br /><br />Going back to greed - the banks got so greedy after a while that they ran out of actual subprime loans to package into bonds that they could sell and invented the \\"synthetic\\" consolidated debt obligation, which emulated the real thing in terms of gains and losses but which actually contained no mortgages of any kind.<br /><br />Obviously we know how it all turned out, but it's fascinating to read just how reckless the industry was (and still is) and how few people were held truly accountable. Most of the offenders still made off with tens of millions. The numbers thrown around are staggering, absolutely staggering.<br /><br />Being Michael Lewis it's an entertaining and engrossing read. You can get stuck in the weeds trying to figure out how all of the arcane financial products work but I realized that was EXACTLY THE POINT when these products were invented and once I acknowledged they were insanely complex on purpose and just to accept it I found it much easier going. Highly recommended.ses but which actually contained no mortgages of any kind.<br /><br />Obviously we know how it all turned out, but it's fascinating to read just how reckless the industry was (and still is) and how few people were held truly accountable.

If you have ever  imagined what would have happened if you had made different choices in your life this is the book for you. You will easily identify with the characters, their lives and their need to save face... A must read for all lovers of contemporary Aussie fiction.
B0091VYN70|4.0|Great acting, story line a little gritty. This movie offered some insight into an area of society that's often overlooked. Would recommend.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I love these type of games.  I have done three rooms and it won't let me go any farther.  So far I am not happy with any of the games I download from Amazon. But saying that.... I LOVE AMAZON!!!  They are always there when I have a question.  I guess I need to contact them and find out if this is all there is to this game. But I am sure they are tired of hearing from me since I have contacted them alot this week since buying my new Kindle Fire HD.  WHICH I LOVE BY THE WAY!!!!!  Everyone needs to have one.  Am thinking of purchasing PRIME.  Don't know for sure yet.  Need to look into it more.  Oh I am suppose to review the game... I tend to get off subject.  Extremely simple and I was done in no time.  :)

B001TXWJ4M|5.0|I'm recently hooked on this series. I guess I thought the show was something different than what it is. Captivating and  unpredictable all the way. Am truly enjoying.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|It's just like playing the real thing! Can't wait to collect all the decks and start the booster pack challenge.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|The entire series was 'news' to me when AMC gave us a little preview after walking dead. I was hooked. This series is intriguing, life-like, a little action without being over the top. Each character brings an interesting importance. I can't believe the show has been on air since 2008--where was  I?????????????
B000P0J09W|5.0|I love the goonies!! This is the best movie to come out of the 20th century for young teens. I continue to watch it in my 30's!!
6305971935|4.0|Saw this movie when I was younger and just had to have it being I served in the Navy and was born and raised in Philadelphia. The movie though is pretty cool and do believe very much from my time in that this experiment was in fact conducted, just probably nothing like the Hollywood version of the results.

B003W77TPC|5.0|One of America's greatest jazz talents (and my favorite) - I think it's true that he's the only jazz musician that Sol Hurok (international impresario) had as a client (amongst ballet companies and symphony orchestras, etc.) - a natural, self-taught genius.
B001AOKA3W|5.0|If there is one individual that deserves the Darwin Award, that is Rob, the protagonist of this movie. The fellow manages to get four of his friends killed out of a guilt trip. If there is a monster in the city, and everything is getting devastated, you help those near you, especially children. You don't indirectly force your friends into a moral dilemma of going deep where the monster is, just out of misguided romance.<br /><br />Given the premise is outrageous, if you take the movie as a Darwin Award comedy, it is an amazing masterpiece.  I should point out that with guys like Rob out there, no wonder monsters are winning. They are surely more evolved. Fun comedy, enjoy with the family.
B00B19DW0E|5.0|One of John Carpenters and Kurt Russell's great team ups.  Great premise good acting all with a hint of cheese.
B00DGMVJAO|2.0|I'm trying to think who this movie was made for. Gory enough to be out of reach of children, and yet it seems like it was made for them.
B004N44SOI|5.0|This is as good as the Heroin Diaries. Nikki Sixx is a genius. I recommend this to anyone who likes music written from personal experience and that tells a story.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King does it again. He wrote great story filled with characters that feel so very real. It's another page-turner.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I enjoy this movie it really is such a fun movie I have seen it several times. I would suggest buying it.

B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Anyone who liked Hootie and the Blowfish will love this CD.  He was the lead singer and has done just as well on his own.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Love his raspy voice.  Have many of his &#34;Oldies&#34; CD's and love them too.  Happy to have this for Christmas.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Fringe is well acted. Fringe has excellent writing.<br />The show avoids soap opera in the first season<br />but the second season is suspect.

B005HEQ4XQ|5.0|This season has some fascinating subjects covered that make one reflect on their humanity/culture/values.  I do wonder how these planets they explore seem to have adequate oxygen and gravity  given the fact the crew RARELY ever have to have ANY breathing gear or gravitational devices. hmmm

B009GX7IRA|5.0|To be perfectly honest, I love all the NCIS seasons that I have watched thus far. Sure, you get a couple of episodes that aren't as well written during any season but 90% of the time this series is well done. The acting, the characters, the script, the visuals, the whole works very well.
B00092ZMDY|3.0|I really did not like this so I gave it to my daughter-in-law and she loves it and plays it all the time
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Love this season. Shirley McLaine was awesome as Lady Grantham's mother. Spoiler alert: The scene when Sybil dies omg I cried and I hardly cry at shows. Throughout that whole episode I cried it was so sad!!! So glad that Amazon has this available. Now when the new season airs I'm all caught up!!
0790737345|5.0|This is one of the greatest movies of Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan.  I loved it and the looks Cage had in his eyes wowed me.  Buy this movie
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Only am half way through, but find it hard to put down. I don't have as much time as I want to just sit and read, but take every opportunity I can.  Can't wait to find out how it ends.  Haven't seen the movie yet, and I won't let anyone who has seen the movie tell me anything about it.
B000ION79Y|5.0|As usual, Steven Seagal is the best action actor of all times.  He sure can move as big as he is great movie, buy it
B002VECM6S|5.0|A TRUE STORY THAT CONTINUES TO THE PRESENT DAY. HEARTBREAKING, HEARTWARMING, AND BELIEF THAT GOOD PEOPLE STILL EXIST. EVERY ACTOR IS GREAT...SANDRA BULLOCK, TIM MCGRAW, KATHY BATES, JUST EVERYBODY! BUY IT TODAY, WATCH IT TONIGHT. A PERFECT ADDITION TO YOUR MOVIE LIBRARY!
B000OVLBEY|5.0|Nicolas Cage is an outstanding actor.  This was not one of his best movies and it was good.  Buy it
B000M5AJQS|5.0|I FOUND THAT WITH THE MANY CHARACTERS COMING TOGETHER AT DIFFERENT TIMES AND PLACES I JUST HAD TO WATCH IT AGAIN. THIS IS A FASCINATING MOVIE, FULL OF DRAMA AND ACTION BY AN ASTOUNDING ALL STAR CAST. A GREAT ADD TO YOUR MOVIE LIBRARY! GET IT TODAY!
B009UNGYHG|4.0|You can always have a charge with no matter where you are also nice case to protect you head set
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|It is not too easy or so difficult that my son has to help get me to the next level.<br />I really get excited when I get 1,2, or 3 stars and a crown! I feel like a kid again for several minutes a day!
B00DU73T08|3.0|If you didn't read and enjoy the book I wouldn't watch the movie. It will seem silly, and it really won't make any sense.
B008P9M614|5.0|Nothing like getting to watch episodes of House endlessly (almost).<br /><br />House is the doyen of diagnosticians!  And Hugh Laurie plays him brilliantly.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|I love laughing and this show holds your interest.  It does have a formula as most TV shows that last for seasons end up having, but the humor and the ridiculousness of the situations they find themselves in overcomes that for the most part.
B000GJ0KOG|5.0|put on your pumps and that bad wig and sit back and enjoy a feel good movie - that turned into an award winning musical this year - see what inspired Cyndi Lauper - a great movie to share to help others understand tolerance, acceptance and having a good time .
B000002TYX|5.0|Items arrived on time, and in very good condition. I always enjoy buying used from Amazon, because you save alot of $$$$ over brand-new, and I was not let down! Buying new-conditon items at used prices is always a good thing. :-)
B00CF34B2I|4.0|I love everything about this app except the fact that you don't have the ability to create your own custom deck you are limited to certain cards in certain decks.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|A very high quality product at a very good price! Item arrived to me in brand new condition, and if anybody who is a true Beatles fan will appreciate this! I recommend to anybody and everybody, and the service was great! I actually had to get a refund from another Amazon Vendor on this purchase, and went to this new vendor, and they were great; they sent me my Beatles box-set very quickly. Am very satisfied with this product!
B006885FZI|4.0|Not as captivating as Band of Brothers, but stil should be required viewing for all, as well as reading the books used to create this series.  It is no wonder they are called the greatest generation, although the armed services of today would give them a good run for their money.
B00CQGU9GG|5.0|I have finally found all my favorite songs and the 2 albums(CD's) that I have been looking for after losing a 2 album cassette that I had had of ZZ Top!
0385349947|5.0|Make me think in many possibilities, I disregard. Motivate me to get in there.  How man deliberates in each situation is another aspect this book call my attention. Teach and motivate book I recommend.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|Play dead... Not so much... lol<br /><br />Well name yourself, you can pick anything... I like &#34;R&#34; hahaha<br /><br />Finally a new spin on Zombie movies.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I was thinking that the short sighted-ness of the author would make this book pretty dumb, but I tried it anyway because of the other reviews. Give it a shot, it's pretty good imo.
B009LA1QW6|5.0|I am one of those crazy fans that thinks Ms. Del Rey can do no wrong, so I will probably be happy with whatever she puts out. With that being said, it's not perfect and it does get a little rough around the edges, but I still love it.
B000A6EXNO|2.0|Does not stay attached easy to loose. Better off finding a cheaper eye cup that is more secure and will not fall off.
B000TERK14|5.0|And damn if they don't get stuck for days. I usually hate when a song gets stuck on in my head, but I never mind when these do. They are so amazing. All of them. GET THIS ALBUM.
1781162646|5.0|I have read everything that Stephen King has ever written.  I read &#34;Salem's Lot&#34; back when I was a freshman in college and I am not ashamed to admit that I slept for three nights with the lights on!  However, this book was a refreshing change from his usual horror genre.  I loved it!  As always, his character development is wonderful and the storyline is just a simple plot.  It is what it is:  a great story for the beach!
0393327655|5.0|It can be a bit of a dry read at first but the facts you can obtain are worth pushing through for.
B00992CF6W|5.0|there is a bug where when u collect the dark leaves with shears and place it they become light leaves
B000TEMS3O|5.0|Their first album will always be my favorite. It's so raw and uncut. Everything is so adventurous and though I feel they still deliver that in their live performances, you will not find the same &#34;formula&#34; in any of their latter albums.
B00AIBZLVY|4.0|a good movie better than expected<br />loved every minute of it<br />could not falt it in any way or form
B00BP3DPJY|5.0|Wow, this album totally caught me off guard. This album is amazingly well written and so enjoyable. Great to listen to for a relaxing day!
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Great book, I loved the way it was written by a dog, and how the dog thought he would be a human after he comes back to live.....!<br />So many things we could learn from this dog. Too bad dogs have such a short life, and that it always ends the same, the dogs of course dies!
B0097NGUJG|5.0|This band is definitely going in a different direction when it comes to their music. A more catchy direction is seems, too. There is not one song on this album that I do not like. I love them all.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book is not just for dog lovers. It is book about perseverance and believing in karma. It teaches how to look within once soul and decide what is important when adversity happens.
B007IUFBCM|4.0|I wasn't a big fan of Drake when he first came out with his debut album. I thought he was trying to hard, but I really like the different road he took with this one.
B00BHMF578|4.0|The events surrounding the taking of hostages at the American Embassy in Tehran are a little painful to watch for those of us who were around back then, but it's high drama and authentic feel make for a terrific movie experience.  The subplot with John Goodman and Alan Arkin creating the fake movie company in Hollywood is almost as entertaining as the main story line.  Production values are sometimes distracting.
B002B0NAV8|5.0|Those who are JUST NOW getting into Deftones, you need to have this album. It's just a part of being a fan.
B00DHNAQ2Y|1.0|The answer to this will determine whether you may enjoy Evil Dead.  If graphic depictions of violence frighten the bejesus out of you, then hurry up and watch this movie, because it has a LOT of gore-laden, blood spewing, bone cracking, flesh tearing violence.<br /><br />However, if you prefer to have some actual frights in your horror movies, I suggest you move along, because Evil Dead is lacking in any kind of emotional, heart jumping, stomach dropping thrilling scares.  Nothing in this movie was scary. Not a moment was truly creepy.  There was no slow build to a jump-out-of-my-seat moment.<br /><br />Visually, the movie is shot well and the special effects are bloody brilliant (see what I did right there!).  The actors all do an adequate job of setting the stage for the demon possession and the reasons for being in the woods.  There are a few callbacks in homage to the original Evil Dead movies that I enjoyed.  However, in the end, I was never scared...I was just grossed out at all the blood and bones that kept being displayed in rampant states of excruciating discombobulation.<br /><br />In effect, this is a slasher film without the frights.  Lots of pain gets inflicted, but there's little else to make you scream in delight at being spooked and chilled. I'm a fan of horror movies (and I love the original Evil Dead films for all their campy goodness), but I was sadly disappointed in this remake. I wasn't expecting it to be faithful to the originals since it was claiming to be the scariest movie I'd ever see.  The trailers with possessed Mia licking a razor blade to split her tongue set the stage for me...I knew it was going to be gore filled.  Fine.  I can accept that.  But where are the actual scares that would make the movies tagline true?<br /><br />This movies is a huge letdown, and I wish that it hadn't been. If I'd had one jump-out-of-my-seat moment, I'd have given it a pass.  But failure to deliver any kind of ratcheted thrill is just unacceptable.  Sorry...but it sucked.  Save your horror movie $$$ for scarier fare.<br /><br />UPDATED---------------------<br /><br />Ok, since some people are obvious fanboys (and girls) of the gore, here are the listed negatives for the movie.<br /><br />The acting, while adequate, is often cartoonish and lacking in any emotional impact. We are provided the requisite number of cardboard cut-out stereotypical pretty boys and girls to make a slasher film...aka the troubled brunette, a ditzy blonde, the brooding male lead, the nerdy (glasses wearing) know-it-all and at least one member of a minority. The story provides little reason to care about them other than no one really wants to see someone else dismembered.  The infinitesimal smattering of backstory relates to the tried and true \\"X parent was crazy\\" and \\"X person has a drug problem!\\"...neither of which really matter to the story or have any implications for the final resolution.<br /><br />So, again, it was adequate, but not outstanding.  Not good.  Not great.  Just...adequate.  To me, that's D work at best.<br /><br />Next up, the special effects.  Yes, I made a pun about them being \\"bloody brilliant\\"...a pun being the poorest form of humor.  Thus, I was making a joke about the special effects...as in they are joke worthy.  We are shown the same skin tearing, bone breaking, knife slashing, blood puking effects over and over.  It got old within the first half of the movie.  I also haven't been scared of yellow contacts since Michael Jackson did it in Thriller.  It's played out, old, and in no way worth anything more than a D in my rating.<br /><br />How about the cinematography?  Initially I said it was \\"shot well,\\" and I meant this in terms of that it does what it set out to do...it highlights the gore.  Additionally, I did like that there were some homage shots to the original films.  However, much of the rest of the film was far too dark or focused in too close on the carnage of a specific extremity. The shots weren't framed to show the horror of the entire scene, they were framed to show the damage being done to a ravaged body part. I know some love to see special effects magic at work, but that's not storytelling.  That's just fake flesh and squibs shooting blood.  Sure, the gore was shot well...but a good film, that does not make.<br /><br />As for the set, the cabin in the woods was boring, being a I've-seen-it-done-better-before-mix of the original films, Cabin in the Woods (which was a much better homage) and the set pieces from Mama. If you like cinematography that focuses in too close, shoots in the dark, and over uses blood, mud, and rain effects...then maybe you'd give this more than the D I'd give it.<br /><br />Then there's the story.  It's laughable at worst and barely adequate at best.  I painted a better picture than that in my initial review, but let's face it.  This is a copy of better work by better writers that feels painfully redundant and devoid of life. It's a relentless gore-fest...not a tale of terror. This, I give an F.<br /><br />The film gets 1 star because it doesn't offer a good story, isn't shot well unless you love extreme close-ups of special effects, doesn't have any range of acting other than \\"be a stereotype and die violently\\", and lacked a single scary moment to get thrilled to, which can still exist in movies regardless of what the fanboys and girls of gore and torture porn would have you believe.<br /><br />To all those who disagree with me, good on you. You're allowed an opinion just as am I. The Amazon scale is 1 star = \\"I hate it\\"...guess what...I hated this movie and I can rate it as I see fit. If you want to defend this movie, go for it.  It's not going to change the fact that - in my opinion - it was garbage.o show the horror of the entire scene, they were framed to show the damage being done to a ravaged body part.

B002CNST10|5.0|WHO DOESN'T LOVE THIS ALBUM?? It's a great piece of work, and I know I will continue to listen to it for years to come.

B006R8GK2Q|3.0|The graphics were alright, the story line was interesting, but the game itself was to short.<br /><br />Would have been more fun if longer, and different types of mini games.
B009DJB8I2|5.0|That's the only reason why I bought this here CD from Amazon son.<br />And that's exactly what I got.<br />Schadenfreude
B00992CF6W|5.0|I've seen that apple products have already updated to 0.7.2 and my kindle hasn't someone help please?? Why does it take longer for kindle to update the apple products?

B0097EWK3A|4.0|Good game but long and it had to deal with demonic possession etc. Really wish these hidden object / mystery games would get a new theme
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Great movie!  We watched it twice!  I should have just purchased it.  Not for the kiddos though.  Way to go Quinten!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Finally an app that doesn't have to deal with demons and crazy storyline and a billion hidden object scenes!  This was just an interesting game that wasn't to long, and had a bit of mystery.  The only downfall is the navigation...lots of places to remember but the map does help some.  The hints are vague or you can click on the &#34;spoilers&#34; under the hints.  The ending is a little disappointing but still a great game.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Fell in love with this series!<br />The first book took me a bit to get into but after that I couldn't stop!<br />Felt like I knew the characters. Laughed and cried along with them (out loud on an airplane mostly haha)<br />Wish the series could keep going!

B003YL4LYI|4.0|Great book in a great series!<br />Sad to see it end.<br />Gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it moved along a little slower than some of the others in the series.
B007TNQ7EY|3.0|The game itself is great. The fact that it slows down my kindle altogether is not. I got this game and started playing it a lot. However, the more I play, the more my kindle freezes. Also crashes a lot, and I can't get any farther than chapter two. The freedoms is still fun, so I'll give this three stars. Also, how do I look at data on my kindle fire?
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|This one is worth every penny.  Buy it and you won't be sorry!  The fact that it is only 99 cents is crazy!
B00633W614|5.0|The Clifton Chronicles have taken me through 3 books across many generations. Archer's masterful strokes in mish-mashing accounts cements his place of the great authors. I look forward to the 4th installment with bated breath.
B00371QQ2U|5.0|This movie still stands as one of the greatest, previously untold, stories of heroic American pioneers, challenging the boundries of human endurance as we entered the infancy of space travel in the 60s. An incredible story during one of the most interesting decades of the 20th century. Watching this HD remastered disc was more enjoyable than the first time I watched it.
B00CHILW64|4.0|This is a beautifully shot film that is sometimes hard to watch.  The characterizations of this family are very thoughtful, and the acting is simply flawless.  The special effects are top notch.
B001N3OJEG|4.0|I was just not able to get into this particular time period piece. I am not sure why I wasn't able to enjoy the movie, all I know is I was very bored with it.
B00C6Q6OAG|4.0|Pros:<br />-I love them! they come with a diary that explains the story behind this 2-pack, it's a super cute story so I won't be spoiling it.<br />-It comes with a few vials, the skullete shape that connects both of the vials can be removed.<br />-The lab coats have lots of details, Ghoulia has little brains and Cleo's has jewels printed on it.<br />-Both have matching earrings<br />-Ghoulia's dress has a periodic table print that spells full words. Some of them are actual elements, some of them are invented<br />-Both dolls come with their stands (black stands)<br /><br />Cons<br />-Cleo's googles are tight, of course this with the purpose of them not falling off while she's still boxed but they leave a few dents and marks in her face. I took them off and after a few weeks the marks are not thaaat visible, but if you look really closely you can still see where the googles were.<br />-Also my Cleo's hair was sooooo raggedly cut, I had to trim it with scissors so it would look kinda even. I'm used to a little bit of trimming with dolls but I own 18 Monster High dolls and this has been the worst one when it comes to how much I had to trim to fix it. This might not happen in another dolls of this same 2-pack so maybe you're lucky and your cleo's hair is not that bad.<br /><br />I think that's it, overall this is a really really nice 2-pack and I'd give it two thumbs up.
B002DJSBMA|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie & I am glad it was available to purchase. It is just about the only Brad Pitt movie I am able to watch. If it were not for Anthony Hopkins, I probably would not have watched the movie in the first place. This [s definitely a most interesting movie about a movie of death, American Corp., taxes, & American Society.
B00BD6KPFU|5.0|Suits is a great series that does not take itself to seriously,likeable characters and the eye candy is,nt half bad!! Even Louis grows on you!!
B0010SKSTO|5.0|If you are a good judge of people and feel comfortable judging people's mood from nonverbal communication, then this book is not for you. If, however, you struggle with figuring out how people really feel and what they are trying to say, then this book might be helpful.<br /><br />It has been about a year since I've read this book and I feel that I learned quite a bit when I first read it. However, the skills in the book take constant practice and use. Currently, I plan on rereading the book and doing so every year or so.<br /><br />Interpreting body language is a skill and an art. First, you must practice it constantly. Second, you must have a good idea about how the individual you are reading normally acts or you are just making an informed guess.<br /><br />While not specifically addressed in the book, one need only think about the accidental shooting of Amadou Diallo in New York a few years ago. Diallo was scared to death, but the officers who shot him thought he was mad as heck and ready to fight. Clearly they read the body language wrong.<br /><br />One thing I really like about Mr Navarro's book is that he has a modest approach to body language. He describes a \\"tell\\" (for lack of a better word), discusses what might be causing it, and explains what that tell means for most people. However, Mr Navarro is quick to caution that any tell is really just excess energy leaking out and one needs to be cautious before making any major decisions about what it means. One man's happy feet is another man's tell for falsehood.<br /><br />I have found a couple of benefits from reading this book. When I notice some of the tells, \\"happy feet\\", \\"gravity defying behavior\\", or \\"eyes wide open\\" (or eyes hooded); it helps me steer the conversion for much more in depth and positively directed interactions with people. After all, I read this book so I could make my interactions with people more rewarding emotionally.<br /><br />The other main benefit is that I now find trips to themall (or other crowded places) much more enjoyable. They are now a venue that I can use to observe people and see what I can learn from nonverbal communication.<br /><br />On a side note, I've used the trick of standing with my hands behind my back (think about the parade rest position if you've been in the military) to create space and keep folks from bothering me (if that is what I feel like at that time) while I stand in line at Starbucks or McDonalds.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good book. I recommend it for anyone who feels that they need more help reading nonverbals. However, I would caution that reading nonverbal cues requires a lot of practice and some in depth study of the person that you are trying to read.
B0053FANS6|5.0|This is a phenomenal trilogy!!!!!! It is on of the classics you never get tired of seeing great cast for all 3 movies.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire continues with more suspense in saga between the Capitol and the district, The arena ticks away with more danger, more fears , and even more twists and turns. Collins continues to keep you on the edge of your seat with her many layered, many meaning story.
B00BNZN27E|4.0|The contents of this set replicate those of the Bruno Walter Edition issued in the 1990s.  For reasons I'll go into later, there is no need to purchase this if you've already got the Edition.<br /><br />My first exposure to Bruno Walter was via Columbia Masterworks M-498, a 78RPM set I found in my grandmother's basement.  The music was Beethoven's 5th Symphony (of course), the cover art consisting of a V, three dots and a dash - the recording dated from World War II when \\"V for Victory\\" was a constant phrase.  The gritty, intense performance made quite an impression on me.  Years later, when I encountered Walter's Indian Summer recordings made in the half-decade prior to his death, I heard performances marked by geniality and cordiality.  Doubtlessly, this was the result of mellowing with age, but could also be linked with Walter's study of Rudolf Steiner's writings on anthroposophy.<br /><br />This set presents several sides of Walter's personality, with repertoire ranging from Haydn and Mozart to Samuel Barber - and recordings dating from 1941 to 1961. By no means does it present a complete picture, as Walter made his first recordings in 1900.<br /><br />Walter's approach to Haydn and Mozart carefully balances the classic and romantic.  The strings have a full sound - yet his performances also are free of the syrupy, heavy sonority that mars Karajan's recordings of this repertoire.  Walter's Haydn eschews earthiness for elegance with gentle wit.  Most of the Mozart works come from the mono era, and are fleeter than their stereo remakes.  The opening movement of Symphony 25 features an astonishingly brisk tempo that even today's HiPsters wouldn't dare take.<br /><br />The Beethoven Symphonies are a mixed bag.  Walter misses the humor and kinetics in Beethoven's Symphonies 1 and 2 - the subito piano in the finale of Symphony 2 is entirely missing the element of suspense. The finale of Symphony 7 is similarly underpowered.  Other performances are more successful, including Walter's Pastorale - which remains my favorite decades after I first heard it - along with the 4th and 8th Symphonies.<br /><br />Walter's Schubert is not the diseased wanderer haunted by impending death, but one of serenity and Gem&uuml;tlichkeit. This approach works well in Symphony 5 and the Rosemunde excerpts.  But Symphonies 8 and 9 never really get off the ground.  It also sounds like there has been some simplification of the French Horn passage toward the end of the first movement of Symphony 9.<br /><br />Inner tension is notably lacking in the Brahms 1st symphony, which never really gets off the ground.  Otherwise, Walter's versions of Brahms' works radiate with an autumnal glow which suits the last three symphonies, Haydn Variations, Academic Festival Overture, and German Requiem.  The 4th Symphony is, along with Kleiber's, my go-to version of the piece.  The Dvorak 8th and 9th symphonies are on the same high level.<br /><br />Walter brings the same sense of unforced poetry and dignity to Wagner that he brings to nearly everything else in this sety.  It's a valid approach, although some may miss the last ounce of excitement.  The same is true for Richard Strauss' Don Juan and Death & Transfiguration.<br /><br />Walter was one of the early champions of Bruckner, and particularly Mahler - having worked with the latter.  Walter doesn't drown Mahler's symphonies with expressive devices, determined to wring the last ounce of emotion from each work, but his moderate approach more than compensates with clarity of purpose and structure.  Likewise, his Bruckner is in the classical vein without becoming stiff.<br /><br />The concerto recordings are especially welcome here, for Walter was a sympathetic accompanist who never high-handed soloists.  Beethoven's Emperor Concerto with Serkin is energetically riveting, with the pianist recorded more pleasantly than usual - even though it's mono, while Istomin is plush and suave in the Schumann Concerto.  Szigeti's performance of Beethoven's Violin Concerto is vibrant with riveting cadenzas, while Milstein's performance of the Mendelsohn is given with dazzling verve.<br /><br />The remaining performances range from elegant Johann Strauss Waltzes to an ardent Barber Symphony 1.<br /><br />Most welcome is the inclusion of several discs worth of rehearsals, which illustrate how Walter patiently but persistently worked with the Columbia Symphony (which consisted either of members of the New York/Los Angeles Philharmonic, depending on where the recording was made, and freelancers) to get the results he wanted.  While he was not temperamental like Toscanini, neither was he a cuddly pushover.  He may have referred to orchestra members as \\"my friends\\" or even \\"my dear\\", but I can't imagine they would have dared to call him by his first name.<br /><br />The book includes an excellent article on Walter's life and career - I had never known how complicated his personal life was.  A note on the remastering: The sound is precisely the same as in the 1990s reissue, and the booklet even comments on the 20-bit (not 24-bit) remastering, which indicates this is just a straight reissue of the 1990s contents.  A caveat: I cannot fathom why Sony opted for the LP sized packaging, with four stacks of CDs.  It's impractical for storage and inconvenient for locating and getting to the CDs.  I would have been happy if they had merely replicated the covers of the old Bruno Walter Edition and put them into a standard sized box, as Sony did for their recent Living Stereo reissue.  On account of the clumsy packaging, I am deducting one star.rmance of Beethoven's Violin Concerto is vibrant with riveting cadenzas, while Milstein's performance of the Mendelsohn is given with dazzling verve.<br /><br />The remaining performances range from elegant Johann Strauss Waltzes to an ardent Barber Symphony 1.<br /><br />Most welcome is the inclusion of several discs worth of rehearsals, which illustrate how Walter patiently but persistently worked with the Columbia Symphony (which consisted either of members of the New York/Los Angeles Philharmonic, depending on where the recording was made, and freelancers) to get the results he wanted.

B003TSEEDY|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It was nothing like what I expected, but I found it funny, sad, charming, and emotional.  It is a novel about growing up, and how challenging and stressful it can be for any child, but especially those society has labeled outcasts.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game so much fun. my friend introduced it to me and I have been so addicted to it ever since.
0446581356|5.0|First off-- I love the images in the book, they are so colorful. She talks about everything from makeup brushes to the History of Makeup. I especially liked the section on How to Shape Brows and the Guide for Selecting Lip Color. This is a great book for someone who is new to makeup and needs information on the basics.
B003KK6GOQ|5.0|Absolutely delightful, insightful and uplifting. A window into the painful effect of war on people in a smaller, less significant community and how it can bring out the best and the worst in people - by their own decision, regardless of who they are fighting for. A special book.
1781162646|5.0|I've always been a huge fan, but wasn't sure what to expect from this book.  It wasn't the typical Stephen King story.  If you're expecting a regular horror story (which he really doesn't seem to write anymore anyway, if he ever did), you would be disappointed.  But a well crafted mystery that had me guessing up until the last few pages, when I finally figured it out.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|this game is a nice slow moving easy game young and old can play and you learn some interesting under water facts
B004XVMCN0|4.0|There may be spoilers.<br /><br />After seeing Guillermo del Toro's \\"Pacific Rim\\" in the theater recently, I decided to go back to this excellent early horror film which he also directed.  Set in New York City, children are dying from a disease carried by the common cockroach.  Having become epidemic, Dr. Peter Mann (Jeremy Northam,\\"The Tudors\\"), the CDC agent in charge calls in help from a famed entomologist, Dr. Susan Tyler (Mira Sorvino).  She has figured out a way to sterilize the king roach by infesting the population with the use of a genetically engineered bug known as the Judas.  This in fact seems to have worked and young people have been spared an agonizing death.<br /><br />Three years go by and Drs. Mann and Tyler have married.  In the meantime, a flophouse priest has disappeared.  A couple of young boys find Susan who they call the bug lady and offer to sell hear a really cool bug they found in the creaky anterooms of the subway system.  She bites on the offer and when examining the large roach, it does too!  We begin to learn that maybe those cockroaches didn't all die out.  Maybe a few survived and as they have done for millions of years, have learned to adapt to their environment.  Now were talkin'.<br /><br />Give some credit to del Toro, who also co-wrote (with Matthew Robbins) the screenplay, for knowing how to make a scary movie.  Sure there are clich&eacute;d horror movie tactics, including shrieking violins, camera angles that sometimes signal a jolt or not.  But he has a knack for atmosphere and intelligent character byplay.  And he's not afraid to offer up kids as snack food either.<br /><br />The cast is filled out with Giancarlo Giannini as the father of an autistic boy (Alexander Goodwin) who also has disappeared.  Also look for Josh Brolin as a CDC agent, Charles S. Dutton as the transit cop who knows the subway system and F. Murray Abraham as Susan's mentor.  I believe that's 2 Oscar winning actors and 2 others with nominations.  If you like a good horror movie, \\"Mimic\\" is a good bet.  Unless you have a big bug phobia.good horror movie, \\"Mimic\\" is a good bet.  Unless you have a big bug phobia.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|This is a fun game. Harder levels as you go. Addictive. Almost didn't try this one. Glad I did. Would have been a shame not to give it a chance.

1844137872|5.0|Don't know if I should say it but I have this guy in my top ten of artists of all time as well as inspirations and artist influence.  It is more than graffiti  and above and beyond some of the art out there that &#34;sells&#34;  What a sham that this world is and he exposes it.  Thank you sir.  Thank you!
0767821629|5.0|Don't know any of the actors, but they do a fine job, and the young woman in the story is what young women in stories of this sort ought to be. One need not follow all the details  in the movie, just get the basic idea of worlds within worlds within worlds, that we are all just players on the stage...... signifying nothing, as someone once (approximately) wrote, and you will have all you need to get through in good shape. Not everything follows the internal logic of the film, but that did not bother me nor, I think, will it bother most viewers.. I did enjoy hearing, once more, Johnny (he became John as he aged) Green's, Easy Come, Easy Go, one of the most mesmerizing songs I know. One cannot say, of course, what the meaning of \\"13th floor\\" is, but it is a neat concept.<br />In sum, while the fundamental idea, and many of the adjuncts to that idea, are not new in terms of movie history, this reworking is an appealing one and should please  most viewers who enjoy a bit of fantasy along with their reality.

B00DU73T08|4.0|Interesting and creative story.  Like how it went along with the book pretty well.  Characters were accurately depicted.  Enjoy the show.
B001K3EXTA|4.0|It's not particularly fast-moving.  If you want a movie with good character development, great sets, handsome, beautiful, and<br />talented actors, you'll like it.  It's an exploration of social class and wealth.
B00005JPAO|5.0|The best method acting ever.  Helen has the role down to a science.  Very interesting storyline.  A watch over and over.  Worth the purchase.
B008Y73940|5.0|Thought about watching this on a few occasions, but never did. When I finally did give it a watch, I was pleasantly surprised.
0307704513|5.0|Very helpful and direct book.  A great way to get focused on your business so you can move forward.  A different way of looking at business strategy.
B00DU74U74|5.0|I found it an enjoyable story of how advisories can become friends. There are a few holes, like why the invading aliens searching for the resistance don't use satellites and other military spy equipment to track their vehicles to find where they are hiding. But the story isn't really about the resistance vs. the invaders. I've not read the book this is based on so the love triangle that develops seems odd, in that there seems to be very little interaction between Wanderer/Wanda and Ian to develop such strong feelings. Overall though I found it to be an entertaining movie.
B009QW7HMC|1.0|The movie was great but reloads every 3 seconds not all of these did that so I know it wasn't my connection some plated with no problem others were very laggy
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Love this version more than my pc version..It seems to be more challenging and it's convenient to just grab and play w/my tablet. THXS !
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|I've become quite enamored with this game. It is easy to understand but still can be challenging. I recommend it might even be good for children but I haven't let mine try it yet.
B009NY43NY|3.0|This series was getting a little out of hand. But it was wrapped up nicely I think. Perhaps not in expected ways but still good.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I have loved the weather channel app on my kindle until the recent &quot;upgrade&quot;.  I liked the view better and found it to be more user friendly.  I do like the new maps feature because it is easier to use and load than the old one.
B006IGZX0C|3.0|I read the book and then had to see the movie. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. I don't think the film was well-cast and it didn't spend enough time developing the characters. There were lots of areas where it stayed true to the book, but also lots of areas where it strayed unsuccessfully. This is a great story and I suppose if you never read the book, it would stand on its own, but overall I was very disappointed.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I use to play mahjong all the time on the computer and stop since I'm always on the go. Now I can take my kindle fire HD with and be able to play when I have a few minutes.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Same thing.  Everything about it is just great.  It is entertaining, filled with suspense.  Arrived in good condition and on time.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It took me about 100 pages to really get into this novel, but I have to say the quality of writing is what kept me going even at the beginning. This is an excellently-written post-apocalyptic novel...great characters with an excellent story that keeps getting more interesting and multi-layered the more you keep reading. I like how once you get involved with the story you can almost identify with both 'good' and 'bad' sides, and see why things were set up as they were. It's more grey than black and white, which keeps things interesting. In the second series, 'Shift' you get even more a sense of it. So I found it to be a little slow at the beginning - more because you're so confused about everything than because it isn't interesting - but stick with it and you'll have a rewarding series.
B00CWV8TIU|1.0|This movie is awful: slow and boring. The entire movie feels like a prescription drug commercial where the actors are demonstrating the laundry list of side effects. Unless you're searching for a \\"sleeping pill\\", don't bother with this movie.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Downloaded for my toddler and was surprised to see that it is actually a lot of fun for me as well!

B00846REIS|5.0|This was a great book. I liked 50 shades of grey but I LOVED bared to you!!!!! You really have to read it.
B0025VLELQ|4.0|The Last Starfighter had impressive visuals when it debuted in 1984, and in my opinion it has stood the test of time; it looks and sounds particularly good on Blu-ray . The story of love and finding your place in the world (or galaxy) is one we can all relate to. The movie also has compelling characters (although Xur is a disappointing villain). From Centauri's commanding personality to Grig's deadpan humor to Maggie's girl-next-door appeal, the characters keep you engaged throughout. I think this film can be effectively summed up as down-to-earth version of Star Wars, although I honestly prefer this over George Lucas's epic series--especially the prequels.
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|Its the best hip hop album out this year. i strongly recommend. get the deluxe album. listen to runaway and let nas down
B00CRMX53S|5.0|Anything Pharrell is involved with is NICE! This song has a mature sound, yet funky and fun.  It's the sound of Summer 2013 for all ages - who remember what it's like to stay up all night to get lucky.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Fun game with excellent art. Proves that free mobile games don't have to feel cheap. Excited to see more. Thanks!
B000IDEQTK|5.0|This is based on Oscar Wilde's story Lady Windemere's Fan: A Play About a Good Woman. The play was first produced on the stage in 1892 and it holds up excellently because the story is universal. It has been made into a move several times. There's one silent film version that shows you how different things were for the rich back then. In the silent film version the rooms are at least 6' taller than we are used to.<br /><br />Lady Windemere's Fan was a play, and said to be loosely based on Lillie Langtry, one of Wilde's closest friends. Supposedly she went to see it in the theatre and never spoke to Wilde again, until he lay dying in a room with that awful wallpaper.<br /><br />The most famous line in the play, and said in this movie is, &#34;We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars&#34; -- Lord Darlington. This line was also paraphrased in Now Voyager when Bette Davis said to Paul Henreid, &#34;We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars.&#34;<br /><br />Helen Hunt is marvelous in this film as is Scarlett Johansson. Without giving away the plot I can say that the two characters have immediate chemistry when they meet in the dress shop, but you don't know why. The two characters are drawn to each other despite Helen Hunt's characters rather bold reputation.<br /><br />Helen Hunt is what makes this film work. She's an actor who always is intelligent in her acting. Yet she is understated so you don't realize she's acting until you start comparing performances. A hallmark of great acting is that a comedian can't imitate the acting for a laugh. For example, Dustin Hoffman uses ticks and devices to act. The result was every comedian being able to do Rainman and people known they were doing Dustin Hoffman. It is said that for one scene in Marathon Man he stayed up all night, got drunk, and generally made himself a wreck for the scene. Sir. Laurence Olivier was to have responded to all this method with, &#34;Why don't you just act dear boy.&#34;<br /><br />And act is what Helen Hunt does, so imperceptible that you don't realize she's doing it until after the film and you still remember her performance. Great performances are subtle, and Helen Hunt has given great performances in every film she has been in.<br /><br />Scarlett Johansson is equal to all this. She's another actor for whom I have a great deal of respect. She doesn't suffer nonsense in her performances. That's why she works so well with Helen Hunt. Some producer should come up with a story for these two and put them in another film together.<br /><br />You will not regret watching this film.

1781162646|4.0|Reading Stephen King never gets old for me. This was a short novel (at least by Stephen King standards) and a quick read. When you are reading it, you forget at times that this is a book about a mysterious crime that is unsolved. The reader get's caught up in the life of the narrator and a beautiful story unfolds. Although it isn't as much a \\"horror\\" story as you often get with King, it is a very interesting mystery. If you are looking for a short novel that you can finish in a couple of days, I highly recommend this book.

034554398X|5.0|Don't read this, it's a great book but, don't read it.  This is literature's top-of-the-mountain and it's just downhill from here.  After a Storm of Swords, reading anything else will be like biting on a piece of chocolate on Valentine's day; wildly difference flavors but, always mildly disappointing.<br /><br />Delicious from the first word to the last period, this roller coaster of memorable characters, plot twists and action will have you on the edge of whatever you happen to be sitting on.  You will love, you will hate, you will see it coming but, be taken by surprise, this...thing made me feel like no other piece of paper ever has or ever will.  He hurt me.  This jerk writer hurt me! On multiple occasions the book fell from my hands as my mind unraveled, processing what my eyes had deciphered.  The worst part?  It ends.  You will eventually turn the page and find a blank.  Heaven has an end, and that realization is my hell.<br /><br />Buy it guys, it's pretty neat.

B00CSSS2V6|5.0|Well, I finally, finally purchased Wings Over America after years of wanting to get it and I'm so happy I did. I've long heard about its influence, about it being such a great live album, such a great Wings album. I think it's all that and more. Paul seems to be at his best here and the Wings backing him are all on top of their game. I only wish I could have seen the show live. I guess this is the next best thing. Some of the highlights on this album for me are \\"Maybe I'm Amazed,\\" \\"Lady Madonna,\\" \\"Live and Let Die\\" (which really rocks!), \\"Yesterday,\\" and \\"Silly Love Songs.\\" I only wish this tour had taken place a couple of years later so it could have included \\"With A Little Luck,\\" possibly my favorite Wings song of all time. I grew up on that song. There's stuff for virtually everyone on this album, fast and slow, hard and soft, hits and lesser known songs. It's a great album for most any rock fan. Please don't wait like I did. Buy this album, because you won't be disappointed.
0143117564|3.0|This is a noir detective novel set in LA in the early 1970s by the reclusive literary figure, Thomas Pynchon. Its a good read and involves a likable PI named Doc, who is investigating a complex case. The book includes a lot of drug and surfer jargon which is sometimes a little tough to follow along with a ton of pop culture references, which is one of Pynchon's trademarks.<br /><br />The plot is complicated and a bit convoluted, but like Raymond Chandler, the story is secondary to the writing, which is the really fun part of the book. Pynchon does have an incredible talent with words and this makes the novel a worthwhile undertaking.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|The stable starts out by giving you a free horse. It allows you to feed, treat, and groom your horse. It will let you clean up the paddock and muck out the stable. If you love horses this is definitely a game for you.
B002UD56I6|5.0|This video never gets old.  Love watching it, often...  Michaer<br />was such a tallented man.  He is greatly missed, by many!
1476733953|5.0|I very rarely claim any book is \\"must-read,\\" but this one is just that. In the tradition of [[ASIN:0452262933 1984]], [[ASIN:0553255193 Emergence]] or recent books like [[ASIN:147671701X Agenda 21]] & [[ASIN:1451625286 The Overton Window]], here is a story that serves as a warning to the devious nature of men in control and what they can do to us. It is also a story of people who rise above oppression and deception and do what ever it takes to fight back. An absorbing book and finely-crafted world.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Good plot with lots of twists and turns.  Will miss the books! Mitch is the ultimate hero for a time sorely lacking common sense and heros.
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|I thought I would try out this series, just on a whim.  I'm sooooo glad a took a chance on it.  The author did a brilliant job of getting me hooked.  This book was such an adventure and I loved every minute of it.  The main characters were written so well.  Very interesting and unique.  I don't like books that don't have wit, humor, sarcasm, etc., and this one filled all those to the brim.  The storyline was unpredictable and quite a wild ride.  The romance is great, but it's really only the dessert.  The story is so well crafted and exciting.  This is an author that I will be watching for whenever new books are released. Loved it.  Couldn't stop reading.
B0096BIENY|5.0|Everything from Il Divo is wonderful.  I bought this set to use in the car CD player and replace multiple other discs.<br />Nothing matches these voices.
B00005NUZM|5.0|Enjoy it. There will never be another Micheal such talent.  Hard to believe because today there is no one  that comes even close to his talent.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Fun and make you look for patterns. Hour of<br />entertainment. Never get old.  Works for young and old people.Very challenging. Enjoy.
B005D9MUWY|2.0|Since the last update this app has not worked properly with HTC mail. It adds letters without input and illogically misspells words constantly. The devs are well aware of the issue from their support forum and emails but don't acknowledge it exists. Email reports are ignored categorically.<br /><br />This is a pretty good app in general but the lack of support is frustrating and renders the app utterly useless for email.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Like the title says, I liked it, but I didn't love it. It was a freebie though, so I will not complain!
B00821OX98|5.0|I really, really enjoyed the show. Can't wait for season 2. What a cliff hanger.Didn't see that coming. I feel like a show addict.
B000BTC5LW|2.0|I purchased the used Cd package and to my dismay one of the disc was defective as there was no audio......the other disc was fine but still a little disappointing. I went ahead and ordered the DVD Pulse the following week and the quality is fine. Hopefully this will draw attention to the staff that does the quality control screening in the future on products used as well as new.
B00ABLJ5NQ|5.0|A long awaited novel from Neil Gaiman. I loved this book, everyday objects become sources of unease. Well worth a read!
0425263908|5.0|This was a very good read, it had a great plot and kept you at the edge of your seat from cover to cover. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes intense romance novels.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|awsome amazing great wonderfull lots of fun entertaining  lots of fun and i like it because it is so cool
B005UKJX4E|4.0|I really thought I'd LOVE this movie. It was not my favorite. However, there were moments that I really loved. I was especially moved by the mother's philosophy in the very beginning and the part with Jack as a baby growing up. The greatest achievement of this film was in making the viewer connect so powerfully with the characters.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|its entertaining its also fun i like it because i get to make my own little town and stuff and pick my own people and stuff
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Longer than most games of this type. I purchased it for my daughter and it quickly became her favorite game.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Nice graphics and easy to play. The game it self to me is quick and exciting. I love this game. Worth the 99 cents.
1442485388|4.0|***SPOILER WARNING***<br />This book from page one is very intriguing.<br />A main character with an ordinary life gets put into a world of magic (\\"but we don't do magic!\\" okay okay) and mystery.<br />The plot is pretty original (though does line up with some Harry Potter plots.)  it's very interesting and fun, if you can get past the \\"big\\" (okay so we all saw it coming) shock at the beginning of part 3.<br />It's interesting, fun, and magical, what more could you ask for?<br />Plus there's a hot bad ass shadowhunter guy named Jace whom we all dream about!<br />But... (why is there always a but?)<br /><br />**BIG BIG SPOILER**<br />Now again I say... don't go into this expecting a romance because after the sweet first two parts, you will be sorely disappointed, and moderately creeped out.<br />I mean... unless you're into the incest kinda thing. haha.<br /><br />******<br /><br />So yeah... this was a very messy review.. I am not a professional reviewer, but I just had to tell people this.<br />Want a romance adventure story? Then maybe stop after you reach the half way point of this book...
B00DUCXFUC|3.0|I will buy this, because I am a sucker for anything Batman. However, it was said they cut Bane's origin out of the movie, but it would be available down the road in some form of a \\"collector's set\\". Well, we have already had a couple for TDKR release. This would be the third and we still don't have it. Are they going to release another one next year or the year after? People who enjoyed the trilogy or just love anything Batman wants to see these scenes.
B0028R3NCU|4.0|Ultraportable microSD but not UltraDurable.<br /><br />Be careful with USB Drive or Reader with PLASTIC TERMINALS because one time (one of 100) I try to put out USB Reader from USB port and it was stuck to port, so I pull hard the USB Reader and I Almost damage USB Port.
B008602KQI|4.0|I liked the Hunger games, it had an interesting story and compelling characters. The cinematography is very pretty at times and I'm looking forward to seeing the second movie!
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Seems like I was reading something that needed to be finish as soon as possible.  Important characters do not make it obviously at the end... however...the way they were done, in 2 o 3 lines...and that's it? what about descriptions, emotions? Nothing seems to appear anywhere... did not like it
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Nice to read a good book with a great ending!  The God for faith...we ALL need it everyday and everywhere.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Mitch Rapp has been like an actual person in my life the past ten - twelve years and he continues to amaze!!!!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this novel.  Grissom's choice for the novel's point-of-view gave a common and tragic theme a reason for being.  A fresh insight handled with the sensitivity the subject matter deserves.  Bravo!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Lots of fun and challenging. Lots of upgrades and different suits to acquire. The enemy's and obstacles make sure each run is different.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved it. What more can I say, I just simply loved it. Read the three books in about a week, and that to me is a record. I just couldn't find it in me to put them down.<br /><br />I read SO many reviews all over the web before I bought it wondering if what they said good and bad was enough for me to take a chance at it; clearly, I don't regret my decision.<br /><br />To me it's a very sexy book and if you're a woman you're most likely going to fall head over heels for the romance story within cause it's just breathtaking all through the trilogy. If you've read just this one, please do go on to the next. I read a lot of reviews saying how the mysteries in Shades of Grey weren't solved by the end and they were left hanging... well it's cause you have to read THROUGH. THEM. ALL. The Shades of Darker is by far the most revealing and it's absolutely breathtaking, having some scenes that will just have you gasp, &#34;aw&#34;, and stare shocked at the book for a while. But that's just me.<br /><br />Though seriously, if you're looking for an erotic romance novel, I def sugest you give this one a chance. It's very well written, it's captivating and, at least to me, extremely sexy. So just... give this first one a try, I could almost bet you'll be glad you bought it and decide to read the rest.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great mind bender of a game. Must try. It's well worth the payment. If you are unintelligent then don't buy
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a great game! I used hints and I was a bit confused at first,but now I know how to play and will not be so quick to use them. I think this is the best game I have on my kindle fire and look forward to more from this supplier:)
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I noticed that I was not accumulating the points I was earning, so I bought some with my real money, and they only showed op for a few seconds. then they disappeared. I uninstalled and am really disappointed and ripped off.
B003VANOFY|4.0|Pros:<br />-Super comfy<br />-Mic sounds pretty nice<br />-Sound quality is okay.<br />-Wireless!<br />-Programmable buttons<br />Cons:<br />-The mute button doesn't work 100% of the time. I have had the red light come on that was supposed to mean it was muted, but it was not. This occurrence can lead to some embarrassing moments.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I have 2 other Seiko watch's, this one is good for casual everyday use. Been working great for 2 weeks now.The green is not a bad color,i like it.Keeps good time and i like the see through back.My oldest Seiko was manufactured in 1971 and still works great.
0061134007|4.0|Highly enjoyable, complex plotting, engaging characters.  Only discordant note at the end was a fairly clumsy series of lookback explanations that felt like an insult to the reader's intelligence.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|An awful lot of death this season! :-(. I can't wait until next season...I watch them all in the summer!
1565847873|2.0|After watching the Kenneth Brannagh series and reading Mankell's reviews, I was highly disappointed in The Dogs of Riga.  The plot relies too much on coincidence and the character development is superficial.  The post Soviet characters are laughably stereotyped.  I was especially disappointed when the villian was unveiled, not because it was predictable but because it seemed truly arbitrary (readers of the book will know what I mean).  This is not so much a detective story as a pseudo political/spy thriller.  There are better police procedurals out there.
B00AVFO41K|1.0|There are no instructions with this game.  Getting 5 of the same color balls in a row isn't too difficult EXCEPT that the game fills in random balls at an exponential rate!  There's no way to keep up.  Maybe if it filled in fewer balls when it was the game's turn this might be fun.  I'm going to delete it.
B006FK7SZ4|1.0|Fake profiles. I engaged in two chats simultaneously and noticed the dialogue was nearly word for word identical from two completely different people. Opt for a different App for meeting new people
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I refuse to buy more bubbles, but I like the challenge of winning with the number of bubbles they give me.  The trick is to clear all the bubbles from the screen while at the same time scoring at least one star.  It feels like a real accomplishment when both happen at the same time.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Fun game that is challenging but not frustrating. Variety of ways to play keeps it fun.  I would recommend it for all ages.
B004UFEJVW|5.0|This movie is a heartwarming, awesome, funny and kid friendly. My adult children, young children and grandchildren also love this movie. Great for all ages.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|This app has stop awarding points so you can't get more colors.  It happened to my granddaughters IPAD version too.
B001FB4W0M|5.0|I am a true science fiction nutt. I am a late comer to Supernatural, but in the last 6 months have watched all 7 seasons now on DVD.  Great family time show......
B005DJREGQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this show. It has a lot of funny, relatable moments.  I would recommend to anyone under 35.  My girl friend calls this her favorite show on TV.
B002SHD9E2|5.0|It was wonderful and something that I can watch (and do) over and over.  The music was moving and the storyline is great.
B004GJXQ20|4.0|Excellent book. Very hard to put down. Gave me as much if not more enjoymenti as the tv series did
B0097EWK3A|5.0|My hubby and I enjoyed working on the mystery together very very very very much. It was really really fun. We can't wait to solve another mystery together.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I use this app almost every night. This app offers a variety of different sounds that help sooth you. I recommend this app to anyone that has any issues with falling asleep or just trying to relax.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great scenery, fun to watch, great acting!  Interesting to see how things were not so long ago!!  They were dealing with many of the same issues dealt with today.
B001E9641K|5.0|The first Ticket to Ride game I played, and a great version of the original.  The only drawback is it can only be played by 2-3 people
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|At less than $1.00 per episode, I don't think you can beat the price. One more thing, the video quality is really good on hdtv.
B00847KFDS|1.0|This is not a new John Fogety album it's simply him playing along with a bunch of no talent, autotuned, talentless, fake hacks (except Bob Seager)but even he cannot ake this garbage sound good.  Epic fail John....write some new stuff and leave these tuds in the trash heap where they should be.
B00821OX98|3.0|I would like to have given this 3 1/2 stars, but not 4. It's better than okay, but I can't really say I like it. It is visually well done, but I'm having trouble finishing season 1. It's dark and feels so hopeless, yet it's shallow. I want to see a glimmer of hope occasionally. The focus is on violence and evil and the characters are two dimensional with no depth or development. I was unable to make a connection with the characters or to feel empathy for their plight. Perhaps this will improve as the show matures, but I'm not sure I want to keep watching to see if it gets better. It does have the potential, so come on writers...develop that story-line. Get us emotionally involved with the characters.We want to like them and empathize with them. Give us some characters that we can like, even admire, so that we can cheer them on as they struggle to take back the earth and drive out the aliens.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|This is a great CD. It is a pleasure to hear Andre do I CD that is relaxing. I would recommend it to everyone
B00C81LYH2|5.0|My wife (and I) have been collecting the Holiday Barbies from the beginning, I could not believe it's been 25 years!<br />This edition is a very nice addition to the set.<br />At first - I was little surprised Matell didn't do a bit more for this 25th Anniversary edition, however it is very nicely detailed and has its own understated glamor about it.<br />In other words, I feel it's in line with the other Holiday Barbies but it doesn't have the *wow* - of the Bob Mackie Barbies for example.<br />That being said her makeup is perfect and the dress is stunning, the pictures don't do it justice, it has an iridescent sheen to it with a snowflake overlay.<br /><br />For those who do take her out of the case she comes with a stand for display, for those who don't, the case is the standard square style, not the oval or half-oval as in other years.<br /><br />All in all she has an understated elegance about her, and a great addition to the Holiday collection!<br /><br />*****<br />Nancy & Jim
0684857219|5.0|I thought I knew about bodybuilding...until I read this book. It  truly covers everything from individual muscles to mindset to body hair haha. A total package of a book
B003GK21U8|5.0|Ken Follett is an author who is always worth reading and 'Eye of the Needle' is no exception.  Tense action that hardly lets up as a German spy in World War II is pursued across the country by the security men.  At first the spy, who is in possession of vital information, seems to be having it all his own way, but Britain is on an island and getting off it is not always so easy.  Highly recommended for those who like action and romantic drama interwoven.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Great series, not usually a zombie fan but this series is entertaining.  Geez, now I have to come up with eight more words.  Thanks.
0765325950|5.0|It was a long time in coming but finally we have the epic conclusion of The Wheel of Time and I can honestly say it met and beat all of my expectations. Rarely have I read or seen any series end in such a satisfying way. Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson can be proud.<br /><br />I won't go into any specifics or spoilers all I can say is that if you've read The Wheel of Time and haven't read this book yet you are depriving yourself of the best ending to a fantasy series that has ever been written. Get this book immediately!
B0064X7FVE|2.0|The old version was great; straight forward with any easily set up locations list. The new version's menus are difficult to navigate; too much added on junk. After using for several years I have deleted it.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I started reading Brandon Sanderson following his work completing the Wheel of Time after Robert Jordan's unfortunate death. He did well with WOT so I figured I'd check out his original works. The Way of the Kings is essentially his Wheel of Time - a multi-volume story ripe with a well developed world and mythology.<br /><br />The Way of the Kings starts the Stormlight Archive off well. Sanderson drops you right into the thick of the world he's created and you spend the beginning of the book figuring out how the unique and interesting world works and the various factions who populate it. If you love piecing things together your self and don't want all the answers handed to you immediately than this is a great book for you.<br /><br />The storm shattered world of Stormlight is certainly one of the more unique worlds I've read about with everything in the land having evolved to deal with the massive storms that batter the land constantly. Within these storms is also the basis for Sanderson's latest magic system. Of all his magic systems from his other books I believe I like the Stormlight magic the best.<br /><br />One thing you shouldn't expect from this book is resolution. It is only the first book in what is supposed to be a pretty ambition series so there are more questions than answers (especially when it comes to the Knights Radiants and the world's past) but the questions themselves are interesting enough that at the end of this book you'll want the second one immediately.
B004EWFV9K|5.0|Mankell's books are always winners for me. Just an opportunity to drift off for a few hours into another world - much like watching a film - and generally written well in translation.
B008OOYALE|5.0|It is a lot of fun. You have to wait to get money or gold in the game which sucks but otherwise it is great and all the little dragons are so cute.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Another easy read that draws one into the lives of the characters. Well written, I thought, with characters cleverly intertwined.
B0053FANQS|5.0|I love the movie can't wait till the next one comes out Fast & Furious Six I know I will enjoy the next one too.
B009ZQFSRA|3.0|I liked the unrealistic action scenes, but I also liked the Matrix. The plot was interesting and some of my favorite actors were great. Yet, I gave it three stars because the action scenes were unrealistic which weakened a fairly good plot.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|My son wanted this game because he had played on his grandmas ipad and this was a cute game. I just downloaded this game on my kindle fire and now it wont loads all of the game. My sonbis upset and I am very disappointed.
1595141715|5.0|The book came in amazing condition, like new.<br /><br />So what the book is about is this guy, Clay who got sent a package of tapes regarding reasons for a girl's death. The girl is Hannah Baker, a classmate who committed suicide. If you get sent a package, then you are one of the reasons why she killed herself. She records her own voice and tells people her story. It is very interesting, but... some parts, Clay just over reacts. Maybe i don't understand how he feels yet, but some reactions are so dramatic.!<br /><br />Some people said that this book is stupid because the reasons Hannah kills herself are not good reasons. But you really have to put yourself in her place. Everyone has different opinions on what is bad or good. What makes someone else unhappy can make somebody else sad, or what someone likes is what someone else hates. She feels like trash, wanted only for sexual needs, used, etc. Thirteen Reasons Why is a great book that everyone, even adults should read  to become more aware of how actions can lead to bad consequences, no matter how little the action seems to you. Read it. It really got me thinking.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I saw the movie first and really liked it so I thought I would read the book and it was great.
B0000UJDLM|5.0|You can't beat the price and the film is sweet and funny. Highly recommended! Even young kids love it. A++++
B0068FYZ3Y|5.0|Its rare I buy any hard media, I usually keep mine cloud based for space and easy access. But Im glad Im bought this, it has extras that are great to check out and its fantastic looking on a home theater system.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|It became too convoluted in the plot....had enjoyed the 2 previous novels by this author but was disappointed in this book.

B005LAIGF0|5.0|I loved this movie and recommended it to all my friends ....<br />A wonderful protrayal of an adolescent struggling with a moral dilemma and looking<br />to adults for support.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very cute game! Diff worth the download!! Always changing don't know what will happen next!! Love it!! Fun for all ages can't get enough!
B00275EHJG|3.0|The first TS was a pioneering masterpiece and set the standard for all future CGI animation. TS2 was a hip follow up classic with dynamite story to suit the action, and the introduction of some really great characters. This movie also had a special group singing Woody's Round-up along with some other cowboy extension songs off the movie plot.<br />TS3 is obviously a way for the TS franchise to gracefully exit out into the sunset, and there's actually a soap opera overtone to the gangs fear of being cast aside when Andy goes to college, finding new ground in a kiddie kamp or school only to find another sob story in a bear who has a chip on his shoulder for having once been replaced. Then Buzz Lightyear has been given a lobotomy by the conniving bear to make him his servant. The only real comic figure here seems to be the introduction of Ken who actually has fun with his part to the extreme of model fashioning for Barbie, in disco no less.<br />The rest is trial & tribulation, with an additional ending of Andy finally giving up his beloved toy favorites to a neighborhood girl. I would have much preferred if the toys found a way to hijack into Andy's car just as he thought he had given them up for good leaving the little girl clueless as to what happened to her new found friends. That's the TS I'd know!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I keep this Kindle cover with the Kindle whenever I leave the house.  I love the light weight and feel of the case cover.
B00000JMOF|5.0|This is the granddaddy of all horror creatures as the good doctor himself exclaims his experiment is not to raise the dead as the monster itself is a composite of many parts. Unlike King Kong which many claim is the best creature feature which inspired the great Harryhausen, this feature encompasses a fascinating creature due to legendary Karloff's amazing abilities to make him come alive along with a memorable top notch cast. The atmosphere couldn't be any better, and the sequel is equally fine.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I love spider solitaire and the creators did an amazing job creating this game! Thanks for a great game! It is a lot of fun!
B004PJG7MW|4.0|Loved this again after watching it with my kids.  I'd say its a must see of all time for little kids.  Quite a bit of violence, but still great stuff.  Our kids loved it.  As usual, we always talk to our kids about violence and point out how the movie's aren't real.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|A kind book, full of out of the box insight, in a style that feels personal and direct. Lovely and unforgettable
B004LROUW2|4.0|The general layout of the book is from two character's perspectives which eventually converge with each other and then a third perspective (introduced in book 2, chapter 2 and given more voice in book 3).<br /><br />Overall, it starts off rather slow but by chapter 10 of Book 1, the action starts taking-off. The book's length came mainly from its wordiness on two things:<br /><br />1) The thoughts of the characters: This was frustrating at times because the rhythm of the situation was lost and it was hard to believe that anyone would think in that much detail in such a short period of time. Having said that, this was also what made this book somewhat of a \\"pulse-rising\\" read at other times.<br /><br />2) Certain details are repeated at times which can be helpful and reinforcing to the story but eventually becomes annoying and delays the action and what-not.<br /><br />The ending was a bit disappointing because of the loose ends left by the unresolved situation that the characters were fleeing (to name one thing). I expected a more nail-biting escape but was left with a rather dry and romantic look at two characters. I guess even in fantasy writing reality sets in!<br /><br />As far as this book's major down side? It was the graphic descriptions of sex and the situations that accompanied them. General descriptions, if not allusions to them, would have been sufficient to get the point across without losing the meaning of the story.<br /><br />All-in-all, a good novel and worth reading.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|Love this musical.  It's my all time favorite.  This Royal Albert Hall version is wonderful and I would highly recommend it.
B008JFUQZ2|4.0|\\"The deeper you bond, the better you fight,\\" Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) tells two co-warriors. Syncing emotion with action with more action, Guillermo del Toro's Pacific Rim is a warmer Transformers -or Real Steel writ extra-large, complete with dad issues and hardware that's a bit lumbering but gets the job done. Something that could be said of the movie itself.<br /><br />It shares a key niggle with Michael Bay's metal-on-metal orgies: some of the scraps, you just don't have the foggiest what you're looking at. Otherwise, though, we're dealing with a different model of FX-engorged blockbusting. One that's steeped in affection and sincerity and doesn't go in for jarringly crass stereotypes, slapstick or sex gags.<br /><br />The pre-title sequence nails a balance between exposition, character development and mass destruction, as Charlie Hunnam's Raleigh Becket voiceovers the state of the play (invading aliens from an under-sea portal are combated by robots steered by two pilots sharing a mind-link called `The Drift'), before tragedy hits and he's out of the game...

0786956291|5.0|this is a great product for people whom are having trouble learning the game. the box set uses a scaffolding approach to teach you how to play the game. i definitely recommend the red box to anyone interested in dungeons and dragons.
B005XN31LY|4.0|Loved the plot twists as we find out the background of the different fairytale characters that we grew up with.  Gave the characters some frailities as well as courageous traits.  Even the &#34;bad&#34; guys were originally good but ended up making bad choices. Wathching season 2 now
B00CWY76CC|4.0|good challenges ...wish there were more rooms! A fun way to spend some time. Made you think creatively as you went higher in the levels.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|Love Tom Hanks and Halle Barry and this was recommended to me.  I understood the plot and was ready for a great movie on actions vs consequences.  It was way too violent, however, and I couldn't get past the first 30 minutes.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|This portrays one of, if not the best, futures shown in movies.Great writing by Joss Whenden, amazing performances by Nathan Fillion, Gina Torres - what more could you ask for?
B00BHMETKC|5.0|There was one hackneyed scene where &#34;heroe finds his conscience&#34; but other than that, this was a great story with great acting.  Supporting roles were superb with meaty dialogue and I can easily see how this went up for best picture.  The market scene was fraught with emotion and made you feel like you were in the middle of the crowd.  There was also an eye for the historical aspects even down to the yellow ribbons reminiscent of the &#34;Tie a yellow ribbon round the old oak tree&#34; song that I hadn't remembered for years.  Ben Affleck and George Clooney pulled a real winner!
B005LAIIMG|3.0|This is a helluva zombie apocalypse movie on a scale never seen before. It is a zombie globetrotting affair as UN operative Brad Pitt is reluctantly recruited to spearhead the problem of finding a vaccine to stop the spread of the zombie pandemic. Pitt travels from the USA to North Korea to Jerusalem and final stop Wales on to the World Health Organisation.<br /><br />Marc Forster handles the huge zombie invasion set-pieces on such a huge scale which reminded me of huge epics such as LAWRENCE OF ARABIA in ambition. My one main problem with this film is they took out the huge zombie outbreak in Russia!! As soon as Pitt boards a Belarus airplane infected with heart-stopping zombies that plane should have landed in Russia, instead it lands in Wales and was obvious major changes happened to the film! WWZ needed an epic running time of 150 minutes instead of 115 minutes. That Russian set-piece should have stayed in the movie instead of the cutting room floor!! I hope dearly with the blu-ray release we get an extended cut or at the very least the massive deleted scenes are on the disk.<br /><br />The scope of this film is very big and I could have done with another 40 minutes in the cinema watching this movie. Still what is left on the screen is amazing to behold and should become an instant cult-classic in the genre. I can easily see WWZ playing out as a trilogy. If people loved WWZ they should check out on Amazon for flicks such as 28 DAYS LATER and it's equally brilliant sequel 28 WEEKS LATER.
B00A8MGLAI|3.0|This movie was ok. the acting was great but all in all this movie was okay. I didn't really understand it all that well. I'm really not a big fan of these mixed up story films. this movie just had to much going on. that's what confused me. it was hard for me to keep up with it. but it was an okay film. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you don't.
B004XWLN20|5.0|I've always love the Superman concept, I'm  just a superman fan. It's a nice refreshing show without all the wild cussing like most of today's shows. I can't compare it to any other show. It's great in it's own right. I had to correct my first review. There are some sexy scenes as the seasons goes on. :-)
B00AQTY3XA|5.0|This is a really good movie. and it is accurate. after seeing this movie I looked up jay moriartiy and the film makers were very accurate. this movie is awesome. the surfing scenes were pretty cool. it is a shame that jay passed away right before his birthday. it is amazing that you can do the most dangerous stunt and survive but perish while free-diving. he inspired a lot of surfers which is cool. and he left a good message which is determination if you can set your mind to it then you can do it. I thought that the kid who played jay did a awesome job. and that gerard butler did a great job as well. those two had good chemistry. if you think about it the student also taught the teacher as well. this is an all around good film. it is too bad that we lost him when we did but his success and memory will live on. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Very detailed story and extremely difficult to put down. Loved it.  It is a very interesting way to present a zombie apocalypse
B002RI9UBS|3.0|It was a frustrating book. I wish I had seen the film. I had trouble trying to picture this boat right from the beginning which made the book tiresome.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Awesome Game!!!!  Would enjpy even more levels, trophies and more video clips of the golpher trying to best us players.
B00CITOS4A|4.0|Very good, no-nonsense book. It has helped me understand photography a lot better. Highly recommended. It has been very useful.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Great, funny and serious at the same time.<br /><br />Love it!<br /><br />Nathan is great, funny and handsome.<br /><br />Do not miss this show. It is better than anyone on TV right now.
B00AOCLWF6|4.0|I don't have cable and rely on Prime and Netflix for new tv shows to watch.  My wife and I enjoyed watching two seasons of the Walking Dead and while waiting for more seasons to come out we started watching this show.  It is created by Steven Spielberg so it's a quality show as far as the writing, directing and acting goes.  I do see a lot of similarities between the two shows but it's interesting and the characters are all very different and engaging.  Lots of cliff hangers so we always end up watching just....one....more.....episode!
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I am in love with him.<br />Well done and casted.<br /><br />Liked everything about it.<br /><br />It's really fun watch the show and see him is refreshing.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I'm so sad that the series ended I can't wait to read the hero's of Olympus overall it was awesome
B0000C3I6U|5.0|dvd rocks ! had to adjust the player to multi to watch. will know for next time when ordering products from U.S.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game.....it's better then temple run<br />BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!<br />I recommend that everybody should play this instead of any other running game :D
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I was awesome I rate it a five star because I think it's really funny and I like the way it is set up with the days and it is something that kids will always like it's really cool
B00CUWWLWG|2.0|I LOVED this game for about a month that's pretty good considering some only last a few days. But then it started acting weird and randomly shutting down, and now the game won't even open. I have contacted gameloft and have heard nothing back and it's still not fixed weeks later. Gameloft I am disappointed in you, you've handled other problems in other games so quickly. What's up? The game deserves a 5 star, but poor customer service and the fact my game won't load puts you at the 2 star mark. Please fix, I want to keep playing!
B007VDN1PA|1.0|The user interface and speed of the scanner is great, but about a fourth of my images have a truly ugly Moire effect in the dark areas. This effect is so distracting, I wouldn't even put these pictures on Facebook (let alone my portfolio!). Very disappointing, will have to send negatives into photo shop for scanning instead.
B006LSZECO|4.0|To much - he said, she said. I would like to know how the author decided to write this book  and why did the author decide to write it in this manner! Could very well be very confusing at times.
B00DM0XXCM|4.0|Very interesting concept of two worlds with opposite gravity. People in the upper world fell up to their world, and people in the lower world fell down to their world. Boy in lower world meets girl in upper world at the summit of a mountain on his world and another on her world. He throws a rope up to her and pulls her down to his world for their first kiss.<br /><br />She fell up to her world when the rope holding her was sliced in two by a bullet and got a concussion and amnesia. It is against the law to go from one world to the other.<br /><br />Ten years later they meet again. They succeed in getting together, but how it happens is fun.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Keeps you reading. You want to find out what happens. The ending was unexpected.I enjoyed  reading the book, Defending Jacob.
B001X0ZKM4|5.0|I've lost track of how many Batman Movies have followed but the first was the original and the best, period!
B00402FGE4|5.0|It is exciting science fiction at its best!  The cast is great and the story line keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Sometimes it is a little more fantasy than science fiction, but still great viewing with not interruptions.
B004M3H17Q|4.0|Heard Wilhelm Scream and loved it.  Finally got around to buying the whole album.  Whole album is very good.  His voice is very unique and textured.  Sounds like he made it in his house (which is a good thing).
B004TJ1H3C|5.0|It is better than watching it on TV, no interruptions and Stargate Universe has a great cast and story line.  It was worth the price.
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|I kept hearing more and more about this album.  I liked (not loved) their first one.  This one is amazing.
B00CDSVZHY|3.0|The movie was better than I thought it would be. It had a sick, but funny spin on how a former slave became a free bounty hunter.
B002VPE1WK|3.0|Would like more flexibility in organizing velcro compartments,  Would also like more zippered storage for memory cards, etc.<br /><br />It is adequate for my needs
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I don't always read books in one go, but when I do, it's the Ocean at the End of the Lane.<br /><br />If you're familiar with Gaiman's work, I don't have much to say to you: it's perfect. It's beautiful. It's real. It's marvelous. All the rest is stuff and nonsense.<br /><br />If you're not familiar with Gaiman's work, I only have one thing to say to you: He is the closest thing you will ever see, read, or hear, from a God. A True God. A Living God. And we shall never stop believing in Neil. This way, He will never disappear.
B004SEUJK0|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie -- I've seen it 3-4 times and decided to buy it for my collection.  You won't be disappointed.
B00A757EFW|1.0|I really am not a fan of the light halo that follows the PAC man, it's very distracting. Not my favorite version
B00DNLXDUW|1.0|needs a LOT OF WORK.  Nothing functions properly, will not scroll,  no graphics just sort of sets there. App looks ok., now just make it work.
B004SIP8W0|4.0|So, the first half of this movie was playful and silly, and then all of a sudden, the second half turned serious and distressing... yet still funny. I was worried that I was interpreting a movie about the Holocaust incorrectly, but no, that was the intention of the film. Weird, right? Some people have found that disrespectful, but I thought the film was very well done. I must admit that I selected it randomly off the foreign language shelf in the library, wanting something new, and didn't even look at it that closely. I was therefore surprised at the abrupt change of pace in the middle of the movie. I enjoyed it a lot, though. I don't care that the beginning was silly. Why not have fun in life? The silliness in the second half was hard to get a grasp on, even knowing the father was doing it for the sake of his son. I think... if I was one of the men staying in the same shack as the two of them, I would have gotten fed up with that \\"game\\" pretty quickly. Well, probably immediately. Him shielding his son from the Nazis didn't strike me as unbelievable so much as a bunch of random prisoners not getting in the way of one man's game. I would think at least one of them would just have enough and explode one day.<br /><br />So, is life beautiful? Not all that often. But, if a man going through the Holocaust can keep up a shred of hope, anyone can.
B008JFUR10|4.0|With the success of movies such as \\"The Host\\" and \\"Cloverfield\\" It's good to see the old time 'big monster' movies finding a new audience. This is up there with the best.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. Aliens are cloning huge sea monsters to overtake the earth. All the countries have pooled their resources to create giant, 2 pilot robots to do battle with the near unstoppable monsters. It's a tough road because the right two pilots need to be paired up and most everyone involved has some serious baggage that keeps that from happening. Throw in two goofy scientists working a different angle and you have a load of fun.<br /><br />From Guillermo Del Toro's earliest feature film \\"Cronos\\" one sees his fascination for elaborate moving gears. He jacks it up big time here. The robots are all very impressive. The monsters are no less so. Some could be in a \\"Cloverfield\\" remake (were there one). But they are mighty, dinosaur looking creatures. The effects are top shelf. I'm continually amazed at how good these keep getting. The cast is decent. Old 'hands in his pockets' Charlie Hunnam is no more or less than you've seen him in other projects. Cliff Collins is always good and here he's given a nifty hair cut and garb. Charlie Day is a hoot as the scientist and they pair him with the equally funny Burn Gorman as his partner/rival. They add much needed comic relief to an otherwise grim film. Del Toro borrows from (pays homage to?) films such as \\"Independence Day,\\" \\"Bladerunner,\\" \\"Cloverfield\\" and others. Some might call that cheating but I rather liked it.<br /><br />The back stories are decent enough to add a bit of depth and break up the action, but they're a short putt from \\"B\\" movie stuff. The music seemed strongly influenced by earlier monster movies. One reviewer complained about the constant rain and that can be a cheap technique to add mood but it didn't bother me. This doesn't set out to be the greatest movie ever made. It's giant robots fighting giant monsters. What's not to like?
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|you can save your live but when you use them all you have to pay to use them but overall its ok
1609611543|2.0|This book uses so much technical language that I can't convince any friends to read it.  I enjoy discussions with friends which, without any feedback it becomes worthless for me.  The book was shipped promptly as agreed.  The author seems to want to impart a lot of information and he seemed to be warning about the use of dairy and then switched back to topic of wheat.  I believe that this could be a very valuable selection if you are wanting to read repeatedly for comprehension.
159463176X|5.0|Hosseini does it again.  I loved his first 2 novels and this book was no different.  He weaved all these different stories together beautifully.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game not only for adults but for the kids as well! A must have on your device! Play it!
B005HEPIDS|5.0|Star Trek Voyager is one of the best series from the Star Trek series chronicling the voyage of a diverse Starfleet crew, against all odds and adversity, working together to find a way home to the Alpha Quadrant after being stranded in the Delta Quadrant by a very powerful alien.<br /><br />Season 7 is the final season of STV and is also one of the best from the series. Umatrix Zero, Q2, Homestead, Endgame are among some personal favorites from this season.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This show has great writing. The banter between the characters is natural and quirky and the chemistry amongst the cast makes a ridiculous premise believable and fun to watch.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|this game was so fun!! cannot wait fir part 2!<br />it kept my full attention and interest I just love it
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is awesome it is so detailed and so fun it is just like ice age the movie ....cool right
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it is so fun. You should get it and here is a tips have fun with it.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This case is wonderful! At first I was afraid that it was too small, it fits like a glove and I haven't seen anyone else with it. I'm going to get one for my Dad too. I wish it came in more colors! =)
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this series! It's nice to watch a series with people that have manners and isn't so sex crazed.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is perfect for anyone who loves horses. You can train, ride, and take care of your very own horse!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Such a fun game! My kids love it! We all love trying to get the bananas, and my kids laugh when the minions get mad if they fall down!
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Loved this movie. It's based on a true story and was very well done.<br />Highly recommend this movie. We really enjoyed it!
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|Just when you thought you had the original Star Trek series memorized, scene for scene, verbatim, this Blu-ray offering gives you the option of the original 1960's effects and an updated, or enhanced i.e. 21st century, effects, which are quite neat and true to the original series. A great buy for Star Trek fans of all &#34;generations.&#34;
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This book really gets you thinking, and the story was very interesting and easy to follow. If I could give more stars I would!!
B004W4N55C|1.0|This app is unusable on my nexus 7. It crashes about 50% of the time if I try to see a tab and is quite useless.
B007SO31BQ|5.0|Awesome product, one of the best documentaries I have ever seen. Truly captivates the life of one of F1's all time greats!
014241722X|5.0|Another good read by John Grisham.  Even though this book was written for a younger reader, it was an easy read for an adult.  I would recommend it for anyone who enjoys reading about lawyers and the judicial system.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a well done program.  Well cast, Love the Characters and the twisting plots.  Keeps your attention and leaves you wanting more after each episode.
0440245915|5.0|I really enjoy John Grisham books and this one was just like the others I have read.  I would highly recommend  this book.
B001MM28JG|5.0|Every single thing about this movie makes it a classic for the whole family. The humor is something I think most will appreciate, but most especially, Star Trek fans. My favourite part is how meta everything is, and how easy it is to see yourself responding the same way the characters do in this film. A++ will rewatch many times.
0142421375|5.0|John Grisham is always a good read, even if it is meant for a younger reader.  Enjoyed it very much.
1449410243|5.0|Makes a great gift. I highly suggest buying as many as you can reasonably (or unreasonably, if we're being honest here) afford.
B004E2XAHK|5.0|I've probably listened to this album a hundred times and it inspires me every friggin time.  I really love the good against evil theme, and 'faster' is just one of the greatest songs ever.<br />I love the spoken parts...raises the hair on my neck...great vocals, great drive.
B001I45UFC|5.0|This is such a wonderful book to fall into after all these years. I highly recommend it for children of all ages. I found it to have good and lasting lessons such as not eating too many sweets and not following the crowd when your heart tells you to go another way. A++, would read again and again and again.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series sucked me in.  I really love the characters and the storyline.  I can't wait for the new season!
B0060CV31C|5.0|Great movie for the whole family. There are quite a few laughs in there that only the adults will truly understand, but the overall lesson is a wonderful one for kids to learn and adults to be reminded of. Also, every character is an absolute gem and you'll find yourself quoting this days after.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I can't remember the last time I invested over a hundred hours in a game. Persona 4 is the perfect blend of fun that hours will pass by and you still won't get tired of playing. If you own a Vita and don't have this game, you're a criminal and should have your handheld removed from your possession and given to someone who will appreciate this game.
B004SOR4H6|1.0|The sponsored links are irritating and the functionality is minimal. Most other apps will do a better job and are worth shelling out the couple of bucks for.
B000JCSBU0|5.0|simply deevine and yeah it was great. thirteen twelve eleven ten nine eight seven six five four three two one
B00CL68BK2|4.0|Was a little hesitant on how this movie would be but very pleased with it.  Very interesting plot and kept you going through the entire movie.  Definitely recommend.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Compact has been fun playing individually and as a family from my 3  year old to me almost 40...<br /><br />Thanks
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I love the game, except for one part, the Vector Battle part (Hard) usually I can get passed one of the things.
B002WY65VU|3.0|My husband and kids like the movie...I don't know why.  But if it's the kind of genre you appreciate, then buy it.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Super addicting! Love the story and customizability. Can't wait for the next one. Maybe make jewels easier to get please
B00846F1YW|2.0|Not what I wanted but went with it. Just looking for something to pass the time when waiting on appointments.
B00AEFYL6K|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite movies.  The movie had good actors playing in it. This is truly a classic movie.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Wise and well told. Great read for self discovery. I bought it on kindle and really enjoy it in my down time.
B001NA6096|5.0|I've now seen this movie three times, and love it just as much as the first time. A testimonial to following your passion. A counter-point to following your passion is another great movie I just saw - Get Low - with Robert Duvall and Sissy Spacek. A must-see!
B000AARKO4|5.0|My boyfriend loves this movie so I gave it to him as a gift!<br />The price was great and he now wants me to find other movies for him!
B00B780TAK|5.0|Forever this series will be a favorite of mine - brilliant script and actors. Laughs and tears both will come easily when watching this show. It's well worth watching. Oh I think the grandmother, Maggie Smith, is one of my top 10 actors now - her wit and facial acting - marvelous (I've laugh so much b/c of her).
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Hosseini balances the stories of a number of characters over a long period of time to create an absorbing story which keeps the reader interested. He seems to have an excellent appreciation of place and understands the characters well. The way in which he weaves the folk tales and the action is sublime.<br />I really enjoyed this book!
B007V508CC|5.0|Item was received as described in a very timely manner.  CD is awesome & met my expectations!  A definite have for my music collection!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My aunt had it and I wanted it to get it and I looked it up and couldn't find it I got another app and it was connected to it and I was so happy that I had it
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome very fun game for the whole family can't put it down happily loving it blah blah blah love love love it
B003O86FMW|5.0|Couldn't stop reading!!!! Awesome book ! Leaves you on a cliff hanger though. Definitely worth your time to read this book.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Everyone kept recommending this book and I was so curious why everyone was so excited about it. Now I know!  Loved it from beginning to end!
0486409511|5.0|I am really excited about reading this book. Each lesson breaks the letterforms down and gives practice tips so you can work at your own pace mastering each stroke before moving on to the next. I am still working on the first few letterforms in the book but already see tremendous progress. I am enjoying my practice time with it very much. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in beginning or learning more about the history and doing copperplate calligraphy. :-)
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I've always enjoyed playing Mahjong on my PC and now this version for the Kindle.  It is fun to play and visually attractive.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book!  Although it was sad, it was wonderfully charming and insightful.  I was touched and inspired. It is a great read for both teens and adults.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app is pretty good. But the money was hard to get.But it was still pretty fun.I would buy this if I ware you.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's an awesome game perfect for horse lovers. Everyone who loves horses should try it, especially if you don't have the ability to interact with real horses everyday.
B001AGNRYO|5.0|This is a total classic. put it on while eating dinner or reading the sunday paper. enjoy. repeat. Prepare to be soothed.
B000L53D4O|4.0|I think this is about the right toy for the transition from crawling to walking, it is entresting enough to keep the boy around, but you do want to watch a small guy that hasn't learned to land on his knees yet.
B006LSZECO|1.0|From the very start of the book I was captured by the characters and wanted to learn more about them. With each chapter I wanted to discover what was going to happen next. The book is nothing less than a page turner that leaves you with the feeling of disappointment and regret! Regret that you wasted your time on what should have been a classic mystery novel.<br /><br />Flynn displays talent as a being able to write with eloquence. However, she disappoints by showing her inability to bring a story to fruition. The reader is left with a terrible taste of injustice and wrongdoing.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|My son absolutely loved this movie. This movie is great for kids of all ages and will have kids and adults laughing the entire time.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Great game to me mind sharp. Enjoy the different types of games. Great time passer.  Many different levels of difficulty. Very enjoyable.
B000002AH7|5.0|From the first time I heard this album in the early 60s I became a fan of Miles Davis and have been ever since
1869504917|5.0|This is a great book for the Tolkien fan to see the locations that the movie was set.  If one cannot make it onto the set, one can live vicariously through this book.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Worth every word.  Not for the poorly read.  Not for the faint of heart. This book is for redemption and tears.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love it!!! I am very thankful I was able to watch this show. Can't wait until the next season comes out.
B00DU74U74|5.0|I read this book when it came out, and enjoyed it a lot. It had been a few years, but I really liked this movie, and was very impressed. I think that the actress did a great job. It's a really cool concept, and they pulled it off well. None of the actors were famous enough that you had any preconceived notions about them, which was refreshing (kind of like The Hunger Games).<br /><br />If you hate Twilight, don't let that turn you off of this. It's a totally different story, style and atmosphere. The love stories are existent, but don't overwhelm the story.<br /><br />I can't really explain why I liked it so much, but some movies just make you think, and leave you feeling a little deeper and interested in life. I especially like the demeanor of the main character &#34;the host&#34; throughout the movie - always thinking before acting, and considerate of others.
B009WUBERW|3.0|Great to see all of these old action movie heroes get together.  It introduces a new generation to these oldies but goodies!
B0000844M8|5.0|How do I even explain.... This was my very favorite movie as a little, little kid. I got it for my 6th birthday and watched it all the time. I'm now 24 and just bought it, and all those good memories came back. I still really like it. It has the 60s feel, but it such an interesting story, and is actually quite moving.
B0000AK7AB|5.0|My order arrived on time in perfect condition. My granddaughter lives this movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone with small children. My granddaughter started watching this movie at 18 mths old. She will be 2 in 2 weeks & still loves all of the animals.
B002O3Z50G|5.0|This is a classic. I remember loving it as a kid and always asking my parents to rent it. Why we didn't own it is a mystery to me. It's a fantastic movie, a great adventure, a lot of fun, and a thrilling concept. I hadn't watched it for years, but I bought it, and it's just as good as the day it came out.
B000HF0KXU|3.0|Wasn't very impressed with the plot. It was quite average. Did not think it was worthy of the all-star cast.
B0038QMREA|5.0|I'm not sure why it took me so long to discover this beautiful man. He has a very unique, scratchy but likeable voice, and plays very well. Brilliant lyrics and melodies. &#60;3 I missed his concert a month ago and can only pray he'll come back soon.<br /><br />I bought this at the same time as There's No Leaving Now, so I kind of have an equal like for both. &#34;Kids on the Run&#34; really moves me for some reason, and the rest are great too.
B0087EVHVW|4.0|no complaints, every thing is working well and it was a good deal. item was as promised.<br />a major upgrade for me, so I am enjoying it.<br /> would recommend to others
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Finally got around to seeing this movie, well worth all the attention. What a beautiful story fit for any age.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I have personally read quite a few of Mr Sparks novels before, but this book was an absolute phenomenal read. I purchased it this morning and i am already finished with it.<br /><br />It personally brought me back to some memories of my own regarding teenage love,  loss, as well as family politics regarding whom i chose as a boyfriend.<br /><br />This novel shows you another side to life. Not every story has the perfect happy ending. Dawson and Amanda didn't literally end up together as hoped. But in spirit he is always with her through Jared's transplant and for that Amanda lives day to day happily with her family.<br /><br />Amazingly written. This story brought so many tears to my eyes. Cannot wait to pick up another Nicholas Sparks Novel. Well done.
B001QHERB4|5.0|Owl Babies is my favorite children's book. I loved reading it to my grandaughters when they were of \\"pre-reading\\" age. I read it to them so many times that we had a fun game: When I hesitated in my reading, they knew it was time to say in unison, \\"I want my mommy, said Bill.\\" To this day, they speak of that book, and they are grown now. Even I use this expression when I am feeling low or having a bad day. I think even my cats know what I mean. It touches my heart esp. as my \\"mommy\\" is now deceased.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Much preferred the older version of this app which presented information in more compact, usable  formats without having to flip through multiple Windows.  New version also drops some of layering capabilities such as clouds/ radar over satellite. Now looking for a replacement.
061301328X|5.0|At first I had thought that I was getting a larger book, not a paperback with a hard cover, but I really like this version because it is so much easier to take with me, especially since the book is sooo thick!  I will keep it forever!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I held off watching this series because I was tired of seeing zombie movies and shows. I purchased season 1 & 2 at the same time and watched them over the weekend. I really like this show, very well done, and it kinda makes you think, what would you do in a similar situation. Overall, good show, like it alot.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Fun for all<br /> Great road trip game to play with the kids... More than 15 minutes of entertainment.<br />Kept their interest for a few hours
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I held off watching this series because I was tired of seeing zombie movies and shows. I purchased season 1 & 2 at the same time and watched them over the weekend. I really like this show, very well done, and it kinda makes you think, what would you do in a similar situation. Overall, good show, like it alot.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|need i say more?  A funny, quick read. Perfect on my Kindle while on the treadmill, although i got some strange looks because i was laughing out loud so much!
1416914293|5.0|Although it took a few chapters for anything to really happen it was amazing. Everything was so detailed and beautiful. From complicated romance to vivid and exciting fight scenes this book covered everything.
B0083UWX04|5.0|Ms. Argerich is a brilliant performer, and when watching her performances, (all superb) she occasionally smiles to the sound of the music.  A brilliant pianist.<br /><br />Carroll L Heath
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Soooo much fun! I could spend all day playing this game! It lets me do so many activities and mini games with my horse!
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I thought I was downloading the actual game, not the help guide. When amazon cones up with the app for the real thing, I will rate again, but for now its less than 1 star!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is a awesome game because you can take care of horses,you can buy more horses, and you can do tasks,and a lot of other things.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I've watched it 3 times, which is ever so rare for me.  I just thought it was uplifting and fun and sounds like my crazy family back east.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|This game is one of the funniest, awesome, enjoyable, and great game ever. Also it's worth every penny. U couldn't get a better game for a better price like this.
B007D5E7C2|4.0|This movie should not be seen by children but it did have a happy ending which was a good thing.
B00BHMF578|3.0|This story is, of course, based on factual events, may be a bit embellished in places. I think on a whole,however, it is Ainsley accurate.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great app:) I enjoyed the way this app helps to use creative thinking and strategies to find your way out of the rooms.
B0095ZQ36G|2.0|Often written in a very stilted and unsophisticated manner. Story often seemed embellished and I had a hard time with the very positive portrayal of the German pilots. It was clearly overdone.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|It doesn't work but if it did it would still be dumb. Did not like at all don't buy !!!!!!
B008I34ZG6|5.0|I posted this famous quote from Zappa for those who gave this classic album 1 & 2 star reviews.<br /><br />There was nobody like him , he was a genius , plain and simple . Anybody who thinks he sold out on this record fits the category of \\"you don't\\".<br /><br />Enough said !
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I play this game whenever I get bored it's like a kindle jaws and it's free totally worth it love it !!!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The main thing this book proved is that it's a lot harder to write erotica than it looks.  While I didn't like this book, and in fact stopped reading halfway through (did it get super kinky at some point? I never found out), I will acknowledge that it's pretty well written.  Especially compared to the vast rush of erotica that has since been published which is so, so, so, so bad.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|not sure about this app. I believe it works well just not sure about understanding it.  Just wanted to be able to read on my Kindle .
B0020BUWX2|3.0|This was a heartbreaking story of being between life and death, and the thoughts and memories that either move us forward in life or hold us back. When 17 year old Mia gets into a car accident with her family, she ends up in a coma fighting for her life, and at the same time being able to see what is happening around her like a spirit.<br /><br />Her boyfriend, Adam, shares a love for music with her and refuses to let her go. With lots of flashbacks we're able to see their relationship as it builds up in the past, as well as Mia with her friends and family.<br /><br />Though at times a bit slow and predictable, this was still an enjoyable read. I look forward to reading on to `Where She Went.'
B008AIGWVA|4.0|I downloaded t for my grandkids and great grandkids , I love that he repeats our words and you can scratch his belly and he likes it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a nice quiet addiction I have developed while laying in bed before I go to sleep.  I really like it.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|I really enjoy watching this show. It is my favorite spinoff from the other Stargate shows. The show is a perfrct Syfy\Fantasy.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|we love this app it is so much fun to play and challenging.  and the best thing is its free
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very  cute and funny. A lot of stuff from the movie.<br />Some what hard. A great kid game.<br />It takes a while to download  but it's well spent time.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|we love this app it is so much fun to play and challenging.  and the best thing is its free
0345803507|5.0|It wasn't fully what I expected, YET it was still amazingly great. Can't wait for the movie!!! E. L. James, you got my attention & my vote.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This book is much better than the first. There was more of a plot to keep your interest. Definitely reading the next book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think that this is a great game and its good at keeping the little ones entertained! I would definitely recommend it.
B00B2OSZIW|5.0|A must for the X-E1. Balances the camera perfectly with the lenses, especially with the new 55-200. Gives a very nice look to the camera. Screws on and off very easily and quickly.
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|I read this book years ago and my daughter had to read it for world history so I told her we could both read it... This time I was paying attention to the history of it. What a good book! The culture, the struggles that woman faced in the country, excellent read.
B00CB4ET0K|2.0|This is a free app, and for the first use it is neat, fairly intuitive and easy to use. The second use, or after  you reach level 2 is when the issues arise. In order to move beyond the intro level you have to purchase points or weapons, which are expensive. I was disappointed and removed it from my device. I felt it was a ripoff, because there  was no warning that continued use required purchase of expensive rights.
B005LAJ1HW|5.0|The best drama series you can find in the market. Now wonder why it is being produced by Martin Scorcesse. All the actors deserve an Academy Award. The special effects and particularly the atmosphere of the 20's recreated, is simply phenomenal.<br />You can't get any better than this one.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Although the characters continue with the wonderful story line started in the two previous books, the ending leaves you hanging. Almost in the middle of a conversation. Very disappointing. Another chapter or two would be better. It's obvious she is continuing this story and is now just looking to make money off her fans
B000FCKC4C|3.0|There are lots of sentences and paragraphs that i highlighted because they were wonderful quotes.  But as a story, it just didn't do it for me.  Too New-Age for me.  But, i can see why others consider it inspiring.
0141197706|5.0|The item reached me quickly, and was in excellent condition!  Perfect to add to my Jane Austen collection of books.
B003XSSR4W|4.0|I was really expecting a CD in a jewel case, not a cardboard sleeve.<br />If I want to use a jewel case, I have to &#34;destroy&#34; the cardboard sleeve.<br />Not that I bought it as a &#34;collector's&#34; item, but there used to be some value in the artwork.
B0081I08CI|5.0|Let's start this review the same as the last one in this series, no I don't watch the show.  I only read the books.  Once I get current with the books I may watch the show on DVD.<br /><br />There are so many awesome characters and plotlines in this book that there is no way I could summarize everything in just one review, so let me just give you the highlights.<br /><br />***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***<br /><br />Sansa has moved from a character that I utterly hate, to someone who I am feeling sorry for.  She is finally free of being engaged to Joffrey, but now she's most likely going to become one of his concubines, forced to stay at Kings Landing, and that she'll never see her home or family again.  Arya is someone I still love reading about and I love how feisty she is and how she refuses to give up no matter how bad things may seem!  Jon Snow is still my favorite of all the POV characters and I just love that we finally got to see more of what is beyond The Wall!  I am very eager to find out more about his exploits and his adventures beyond The Wall with the Wildlings.<br /><br />But Theon, oh God, Theon.  What are you doing buddy!?!  You could have had such an amazing future ahead of you!  The Starks were pretty much your family for years!  If you weren't getting the title and the respect and military status that you want on the Iron Isles, then go to Winterfell and swear loyalty to the Starks!  I'm sure they'd grant you a lordship, a command of your own and you'd have pretty much everything you want that your father isn't giving you.  Plus he just makes one bad decision after another that leads to his eventual demise.  I was kinda hoping he would last longer, but at least his downward spiral was cool to read about.<br /><br />Also, can someone explain to me what exactly a \\"Zorse\\" is?<br /><br />***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***<br /><br />This was a great sequel to the first book, and I am very eager to read the next book in the series.  This is a must read!ook in the series.  This is a must read!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is fun if u r on a long road trip or just bein bord so get this app it dont load slow
B004WGGQPQ|3.0|This is a great app, very easy to use ad fun. I do wish there were more design patterns for the paper options, keep it hip and up to date. Ie: chevron and ikat patterns. And as  baseball sticker please. Go A's!
1400032717|4.0|Solid book, hence the four stars. But my book was a bit beat up. It was actually more tarnished than expected. Still usable but the covers were rough.<br /><br />The book itself was a brilliant step into the mind of those who suffer from Asperger's Syndrome. Mark Haddon captures this perfectly through Christopher. Excellent writing style and interesting story line. Highly suggested.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Works like a charm for me, super Idea this cloud stuff!! Easy to use and download, for FREE! I will be enjoying my music even if the disks get lost or scratched beyond repair.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Kept me hooked from the beginning.  Think I found a new series to follow, cant wait for more of Will Robie.
0345803485|4.0|A little repetitive for me. It's a lot of back and forth drama over and over again. Many of the same adjectives and words were used rather than finding a new saying. I didn't finish reading it. Got about 3/4 of the way finished and quit.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|One of the kids movies that comes out that they obviously put some time and effort into. I thought it was very cute and I loved the story! Worth the watch!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Although I thought it was a slow book to get into, I became captured once the drama began.  I was trying to solve the mystery as I read and determine my own verdict.  It contained many twists that kept me engaged.
B000GFLKEY|5.0|Awesome movie with a good twist!!  You think you know what the ending might be, yet you'll be surprised. It definitely keeps you on your toes wondering who, when, where, what.....and why!!
B002WJI66C|2.0|It was not put together well...especially for the price.  I've received better stuffed toys from a carnival.  The teeth were sticking out, not down like the pic shows.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Total chick flick, which I love!!  I originally bought this movie for my daughter who loved it the first time she saw it and wanted to own it just to have the pleasure of watching it any time she wanted to. I, also fell in love with it.  The music, the characters and the comedy involded in it is a perfect combination for a good movie-night.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|A great calculator for my Kindle Fire hd. Easy to use and is always available. I am happy to replace my bulky calculator.
B002FOQY2M|5.0|Again I think Fun is the next best thing to slice bread...lol...I just think his music is awesome...would recommend most definitely!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love love love. Minions are adorable. Love despicable me. Just wish there were more opportunities for power ups. :) Completely addicted to this game.
0425263924|5.0|the book was great the author left you wanting to read the next book (which is not even out yet ) so I'll will be definitely waiting for the next book to come out....very good read!
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|This is truly a remarkable story about not only the unbelievable hardships that were endured but the partial triumph of the human spirit to overcome the suffering and injustice.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I think his music is great..the whole cd is nice like every song. He has such a unique style his music great!
B004LROUNG|5.0|Grisham is the master. Just when you think you have it figured out he places another fork in the road. Quite a brilliant read.
B008J34466|5.0|the firs cd I ever purchased by pink and the whole cd is great ....love it. would recommend good music!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Challenging, but not tooooo challenging, I liked the fact that there were items to explore that weren't part of the clue set, so they kept you guessing and really using your head.  Wish there were more levels! Looking forward to trying more games from this group.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is so fun I love it so much it's made for little kids and big kids I love it!!!!!!
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Great game for children and pretty much fun for this grandmom. The lack of intrusive permissions makes it a game worth paying for. Funny little monkey is a real pleaser.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Absolutely love this game. I was so glad to see that it had been made available to play on the Kindle Fire. A must have for Jurassic Park fans. There are now three areas to build: normal (jurassic), aquatic and now glacier parks. There are also weekend specials every week. Highly recommended!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I'm sure the game is very cute, fun, desirable--we all love those Minions!--BUT I don't have time to wait for many many minutes while this thing loads.  Never got to any &#34;play&#34; feature because after the cartoon and the play or pay screen, the next loading process to actual game playnever finished, and I got tired of waiting.  Remembering what WAY too many other purchasers and potential users of this game said in their reviews--crux: game never loaded or crashed their Kindle Fire--I decided to opt out and I deleted the game.  Let us know when this is fixed and PLAYABLE on our Kindle Fires, Amazon!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like weather bug on my droid but this app is so much better for my kindle and it is very accurate on my local weather conditions.
1844488748|5.0|this is a very beautiful handcraft book indeed. well-positioned, well-arrangement and sharp. Consist of both clear instruction in illustrations n photograghs.
B004VMUS9G|3.0|I love the layout and how it works but I am a heavy sleeper and this was just too quiet.  It was a major help during the time my cell phone was stolen and the time I replaced it so it is a great app, just too quiet for my needs.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like the way it plays so smoothly.  A great way to pass the time while waiting.  I recommend this
B004GYY714|5.0|I love this because I can listen to local stations as well as radio shows my local channels do not pick up.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The show is completely addicting. Can't wait for season 4 and will probably rewatch seasons 1 thru 3 again just for fun.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I love having eBay mobile app because it makes it easy for my to keep tabs on the auctions I am participating in as well as giving me alerts when things I am watching are ending.
0316227706|3.0|Very cute book. I was expecting a little more from it. There are quite a few pics that where you can't even see the dogs face, but it was nice too look through just not the type of book that you keep looking through over and over.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I thought this book was good but the actually battling was hard to follow and i think the ending could have been better.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey is a must see. Love this show. Makes you smile and cry. Cannot wait til season 4. Thanks Amazon for putting the episodes on Prime!
0765325950|5.0|Brandon Sanderson did a great job in completing Robert Jordan's work.  When Jordan died, I thought that the story would die with him.  When I found out that Sanderson was going to take up the work, I braced myself for disappointment.  I am so happy to be proven wrong.  This book is great and the ending phenomenal.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|RI don't care for the layout it was better before they upgraded it and was easier to get the forecast and radar
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This product was the only thing that I used all of the summertime.it was the greatest game that that I played with.<br />Sunday-aremu@att.net
B000W1SSV0|5.0|Samba jazz doesn't get any better than this.  The rhythms, those unmistakable samba guitar chords, and Getz's saxophone evoke, interestingly enough, two separate moods for me.  This music evokes the hot, hazy, thick air of summer and yet, on a quick turn, can also seem like a musical portrait of a rainy beach at night.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|This book is fantastic, as are the others in this series.  I couldn't put it down.  I've read it twice now and will definitely read it again.
B00607EWYC|4.0|Not something everyone would appreciate.  Has a lot to do with male genealogy and bonding.  It is the kind of book that could easily be read more than once.
B0073LWEXK|2.0|The graphics enticed me to purchase the game.  Once I began playing, it became very difficult.  There were too few clues and if you can't progress you lose interest.
1401937268|5.0|This order was sent as a gift. It arrived in excellent condition and my client was thrilled to find it in her mail.<br />I appreciate that it was in the condition it stated it would be and that I did not have to purchase it in retail and then wrap and ship it myself. Great resource!<br />Thanks for doing great business!
B00C7TAF3Y|3.0|The graphics are great and, with difficulty, you are able to move deeper into the mystery.  It could use more clues.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love it. You can choose so many different stages,vehicles, and parts!!!! It's<br />SOOOOO fun and funny. Fun for the kids.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Each game is different and is more challenging than the one before.  Sometimes it takes more than once to complete the puzzle, but it is easy to reset and try again.
B008I34YYY|1.0|It's not the fact that Iron Sky is a bad movie that upsets me.  It's the fact that it has an idea so ripe for exploitation---space Nazis from the moon---and throws it in the garbage.  Then it drowns it in heavy handed satire, chokes it with execrable dialogue, blinds it with cringeworthy acting, and finally silences it with a potted syfy-brand soundtrack.  It couldn't have been worse if it were produced by a group of emotionless clones who did not have a full understanding of human interaction, much less humor.<br /><br />I cannot imagine whom the producers thought would think any aspect of this movie was entertaining.  It is my understanding that it was a joint Finnish-German-Australian production, though which members from the production team were responsible for each aspect of production I can only guess.  My hypothesis goes thus: the Germans thought that by producing a satire of Nazism would somehow ease the pain of its memory, and their role in it.  The Australians apparently thought that out-of-date political jokes that appeal to very small population percentages are riotous, and a wise investment choice.  As for the role of the Finns, I can only guess, but I suspect it has something to do with having far too much money, and having a desire to throw it in enormous, expensive special effects blobs until they eliminate every original idea in sight.<br /><br />The actors can't even deliver their lines without sighing with their eyes.  If I ever meet Udo Kier, I simply want to remind him of the masterpiece he made in Shadow of the Vampire, and then simply walk away while he silently weeps at the direction he has taken his career.<br /><br />I am not proud of this review, but I am writing it in the painful afterglow of having shut the movie off and thrown it in the trash.  I am still in pain.  As Roger Ebert once said, the movie made me do it.
B0063GORYU|4.0|The first level makes it easy to learn the game and develop strategies.  Once you have mastered the first level, moving to the second is quite a challenge.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game is awesome i alway played with my brother at night now i can play it any where any time i love it so  i say it is worth your money buy it now asap :]
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is an incredible series.  I'd consider it to be a classic collection that can be viewed over and over.
B00000J7JO|5.0|This is an album literally anyone can come to love, and often the one that turns people into RHCP fans. One of the few albums you could buy blind and be pretty guaranteed to enjoy.
B00BN4JQ6G|5.0|great band , i was their at the o2 gig brill night , will do again,and again and again, and again
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This was a great book, could not put it down!  I hope there is a 4th one, since the ending kind of leaves some questions unanswered--please let there be a 4th one!
B00BSHVSQ4|4.0|For the Avid Eagles fan that can afford this package its worth it. It was given to me as a gift. Worth owning but VERY PRICEY for its contents . The other Eagles &#34;package&#34; on Blu-Ray of the same documentary and concert are a better bargain at under $40....................
B006964E8S|5.0|John Puller is either a sophisticated Jack Reacher or Jack Reacher is a rougher version of John Puller. Either way it is an exciting read
B00B8PRDHE|5.0|If you are a Beatles fan/ Ringo fan just buy this the music is timeless and the guest musicians are incredible..<br />you will enjoy it at an inexpensive price.......
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game  .love it very challenging. Definitely worth getting. My kids got me on this app and now I'm hooked can't put it down. Try it for urself.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|After the movie ended I wasn't really sure if I liked this movie or not. As you see I have given it 4 stars, so I eventually came to realize I did like it. I'd have given it a 3.5 if I could, because the cast was weak, all talented and all did well, but it was almost like they were the B team, like everyone Sam Raimi really wanted was out shooting another movie. James Franco did a great job with his part, he made the wizard a believable charlatan and fake put in an awkward position, you believed that he was shady and not totally on the level with everything he did. On the Oz side, of the witches only Michelle Williams as Glinda seemed to fit the character, where Mila Kunis and Rachel Weisz seemed odd cast choices.<br />In the end they all worked well together on screen, the story was fun, the graphics were beautiful. When I think Sam Raimi my first thoughts are to Evil Dead, and this was the absolute opposite to a cabin in the woods. The colors and set pieces were brilliant. it was Oz come alive. And let me say I am not a fan of The Wizard Of Oz film, I respect it for what it was and the time, but as a musical it keeps me at arms length. And in this film when the munchkins begin to sing and the wizard waves them off and stops them, that immedately gave this movie another star. I want my fantasy to fantastic, leave the singing for the drama club.<br />I dont feel this movie earned its 4 stars but I'm giving it anyway.
B00D6BQG1W|4.0|Romantic comedies aren't my favorite but I couldn't resist because of the zombies. It has some twists that I didn't see coming but I'm really glad I didn't go watch this in the theater. My 15 yr old niece loved it but it wasn't as funny as the previews made it look. What movie does live up to the previews though?
B000JMKTLO|5.0|i have been reading for well over 55 years and i have never read anything like it. suspenseful at every turn. when i finished i just wanted to scream a few times to let it out
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is the best game ever. it is like subway surfers. It will make me want to get on my kindle fire. And play minion rush.
B005EHQGTS|1.0|When I connect to the computer, the app closes and I go to the home screen. Splashtop 2 works fine though.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game always makes me want to get my kindle fire. And play play play play play play play play play play on minecraft pocket edition. IT is fun to play play play on the iPhone,iPod,iPod touch,iPad and kindle fire. It is my favorite game ever you should download minecraft pocket edition now. It is easy.
B006RJTEIC|3.0|Would have been better if there was a caption option in renting movies to watch in Amazon.  That's why I won't sign up for prime.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I felt like I was reading a grade school level book (obviously with the exception of the sexual content).  I am shocked that so many people went on to buy the other two books. I kept reading because I can't stand to start a book and not finish it but it was a chore.
0812415027|2.0|Because we enjoyed this book from the library and the television series, we ordered the book for a gift.  The book arrived with a broken binding and the book was small.  No thanks!
B002PEP4SC|4.0|I love the Tv program Castle.  The book was also good.<br />I will continue to read more of this series.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|It was not as good as the two other books.  The story was not as gripping and interesting as the others.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Nice progression of difficulty and challenge. Not sure about the context. The historical progression doesn't seem to relate. To the puzzles very well
B008KOTNVA|5.0|Needed the dreaded &#34;pentalobe&#34; screwdriver to get inside a Macbook Air.  Great set of tools.  Highly recommended for anyone who needs to crack open a Macbook Air with the proprietary &#34;pentalobe&#34; screws.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Even though I think his books were long enough. This one was just great! He taps into the I imagination like few others can
B000AYEL6U|5.0|A moving dramatization worthy of all five stars and many more!!!<br />Gritty and down to earth, this period drama takes one out of the glory of the manor, and into the streets of those who work hard for their livelihood.<br />Do not miss this one.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|This might be the best album ever.  I always considered Joe Walsh as that talented guitar-playing guy who had a &#34;unique&#34; voice among more angelic (Don Henley) and steady rock (Glen Frey) voices of the Eagles.  If this is what Joe Walsh can do off drugs, he missed out on a good chunk of masterpieces during those drug-hazed years.  Maybe he had to go through all that to get to this point.  If he blasted into almost any of the numbers on this album during an Eagles concert, he'd have everyone on their feet.  He sounds inspired, happy, and like he's having fun.  There is plenty of great guitar (as you would expect), but beyond that his vocals and arrangements are spot on.  There is a wonderful mix of ass-shaking tunes, relaxed, upbeat almost fast ballad stuff, rock and roll, and through it all is a master musician who has paid his dues and now is reaching the high-point of an incredible career.
B00C061I3K|4.0|it is everything i thought it would be an more! great music, great beat, fun summertime entertainment.<br />i recommend to anyone who will listen...
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|Be aware that this is ONE DISC, 3-D version only.  No 2D blue-ray or regular DVD. If you want to watch this anywhere but your 3D setup, must buy those separately, adding up to even more $$ for Disney.  Disney has evolved into a non-family friendly monolithic corporation with nothing but $$$ on their minds.
B00DM0XXCM|4.0|This movie is visually stunning, but don't expect a coherent story. The plot is essentially a planetary version of Romeo and Juliet, with an interesting astrophysical premise. However, there are plot-holes galore in this movie and often the romance seems forced and fickle. That's not to say that if you wake the story at face value you won't enjoy it; even though I nit-picked every little detail while watching it (and there are a lot of glaring inconsistencies), I still enjoyed the movie as a whole.<br /><br />What this movie has going for it the most are the settings and cinematography. If you are a fan of the Final Fantasy series of video games, this is definitely a movie you would want to watch. It very much resembles Final Fantasy in its setting and visuals. If they would have called it Final Fantasy XVI: The Movie, I would have believed them. A lot of the technologies, story ideas, and setting concepts seem straight out of those games.<br /><br />Some of the major problems I had with the movie, however, emerge from the combination of the two aforementioned components of the movie: its romance story and the setting/aesthetics. One problem I had is that this seems way too massive of a concept to have just been shunted to a simple romance movie. The movie really tried to make the romance live up to the epic qualities of the universe in which it took place, but I don't think it quite made it. The universe seemed much more epic in scope, and the love just seemed to dumb things down. The reason Final Fantasy works (and, perhaps, why the actual FF movie didn't) is because those games have large universes that you can explore for more than 2 hours (the time a movie allows you). I really think the concept of this movie would have worked better as a video game (if the mechanics could be made to work right, this would make an amazing MMORPG), TV series, or novel. (Or, as a series of movies, but, seeing as the movie got overwhelming negative reviews for some of the elementsthat I am highlighting, that seems unlikely.)<br /><br />The reason I would have liked to see this more expansive format is because the interesting lore parts of the movie, and the more in-depth elements, were ignored and just pushed to the beginning and end of the movie, where they were just explained by a narrator's voice. This was so we could get to the love faster. However, as I've said, the romance plot was full of holes and, without other plot elements to go along with it, distilled the movie down into something less epic than it should have been.<br /><br />I think this movie has something, but we just aren't given enough of that something.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|this game is amazing but sometimes it freezes or doesn't open at all. I do recommend all ages and is very fun.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|I really enjoy the challenge of figuring out how to get out of the rooms.  Cant wait for more levels!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love temple run two but don't get it if u have a kindle fire-after a week when u press it it loads then goes back to home screen. That's disappointing for me:'(
B0097HSS4M|5.0|Easy to use and does what it says!! I can finally be proud of my photos!!!! No more terrible profile pics for me! So I give it a grand total of five stars :)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|even though minions are in a kid movie I think it could be fun for anyone its just like temple run or super Penguin-but u get to battle Villons from Despicable Me-how fun:.)
0345529057|5.0|IF THE BOOK WERE A LITTLE BIT BIGGER MY EYES WOULDN'T HURT SO MUCH WHILE READING IT :) 2 2
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Loved it! It confused me at first, but I understood by the third story. Quite captivating and once you start reading, you don't want to stop!
0345529057|5.0|Books were in excellent condition, awesome stories that are really in-depth. Everyone should read these. It came in original packaging in mint condition. Love it!
B000WYCF6Q|3.0|Handy does its job, fits well into the handle, suitable to my friends like me. Some said to buy it.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Love this game ,just started playing but it is awesome.<br />Wish you could have neighbors though and travel from city to city. OH well it's fun none the less!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|fast easy service. Thanks very much!  the cable works perfectly and I am back to reading on my kindle again!
B004N868DS|5.0|Suits everything you would ever need for your mice. Alluminum body ensures it wont be worn or destroyed anytime soon!
B004TMPJP6|5.0|I use this app daily. I like that it works on my Mac, my droid, and my Kindle Fire. I've tried three to-do list / task list managers and this is the best one.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My sister introduced me to this game and I found it to be fun to play. I don't like the way the app keeps offering a different game to try.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I saw a few variations of this app; I would like to have it integrated with the lock screen tho
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Great read. I've heard mixed reviews about this book and this series, and while I'm not nearly five with the series, I do enjoy this book. Sure, some of the vulgarity is not needed. Sure, the story is in depth with its exploitation into bdsm. Bottom line, if you love romance novels (nee soft porn) you'll like this read.
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|IT HAS BEEN SOME TIME SINCE I PURCHASED THIS DVD, AND HAVE ONLY WATCHED IT TWICE.  THE STORY WAS GOOD, A LITTLE TOO MUCH BLOOD AND GORE, BUT STILL A WORTH WHILE SELECTION FOR MY LIBRARY.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Yay! I win! It was very entertaining and it took less than an hour to complete all ten levels. Though the last was rather frustrating. I wish there were more games out there like this because it makes you think. And you feel awesome when you complete a level. It makes you feel almost genius.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! It's much better than temple run. Especially for holidays when that holiday character is chasing you.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Anybody who's ever been in software development or systems administration will immediately recognise the first half of this book. Anybody who's been at the receiving end of a computer system will probably understand why. And anybody who will ever do anything connected to business management, business development, system development, software development, systems administration, change management and ... well, anything related to a modern production, really, should absolutely read this book. The first half tells why, and the second half tells how. Why you should read it, and how things should be done. It's everybody's responsibility.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I thought the book was very well written, love the characters and the story is very sweet. Highly recommend this.
B00BZF7REQ|5.0|An amazing book, really beautifully produced. A wonderful history of Vogue and Fashion and an inspiring book for our library.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|After playing multiple times and utilizing all the features, this is by far the best Mahjong app out there. I've tried a couple and nothing else compares.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|This is a terrific drama. Both my husband and I are huge fans. Anyone who enjoys Aaoron Sorkin dramas will love this. The cast is stellar, the writing is creative and keeps you hooked. Totally a \\"lets just watch one more.. \\" show that always keeps us up late.
B003PBB4ME|5.0|Awesome item!! Great for anything you wanna do. Item was exactly as described! Would highly recommend.  Brand new. Very fast shipping!!!
B005PK57NU|5.0|Love The Good Wife. Characters and acting is great, writing keeps you hooked, and the guest stars are awesome. Highly recommend.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|They stretch the science a little beyond the &#34;Fringe&#34; sometimes, but overall a wonderful series.  Character development and plots are excellent.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I went kicking and screaming into the Kindle age, I love books, until my kids took matters into their own hands and gave me one for my birthday.  I adore it.  Easy to use, easy to hold, easy to read, easy to get new books, almost too easy there.  Does it replace books for me?  No, but it does make reading something anywhere, anytime just that much easier.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|Not what i was expecting. I felt it was very simple and predictable. I would shop around more before buying this average read.
0545128285|5.0|Taking a break from reading the series, so I thought I'd buck down and actually read all the short stories in this book.<br /><br />I loved them all. My favorite short story is The Fountain of Fair Fortune. An excellent fairy tale where three women can find their own happiness without Knight Luckless's help.<br /><br />Each story is a translation by Hermione Granger. We never hear her opinions of the story and there needn't be one. After the translated story, Albus Dumbledore gives his opinion and explanation. There are also footnotes of his and J. K. Rowling's for Dumbledore's works.<br /><br />For those that were sad about the end of The Half-Blood Prince of book 6 (like myself), this book is a treat. It keeps Dumbledore in our hearts.
B00138J7V6|5.0|[[ASIN:B00138J7V6 Chariot]] I didn't know much about this artist<br />but for $2.99 I gave it a try. I'm so happy I did. He is Super in<br />this album!!!
B00BNR6RH4|5.0|The record is great, the packaging was great, but this product was delivered to someone else's address!! It was a good thing that the person was honest and brought it to my home. Hope this is just a fluke.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Nice game! Very easy to figure out and get addicted to.  I think the graphics are amazing and they work very well.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|awesome continueness fun game. its better than most puzzle games the action it endless for anyone that likes puzzle games this is a must have to download
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Slow loading and execution, takes up more memory than is necessary. Not enough help for the complexity of the app.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|I can't get it to open on my phone after entering my password n login name. Don't really recommend for samsung 3
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I couldn't put the book down.  Every time I took a needed break from reading, I ran back to the Reacher novel and started reading again.  I finished it in two days.  It kept me on the edge of my seat, making me want to find out what was coming next, which is exactly what  a good book should do.  I must confess that I picked out Killing Floor because of the Tom Cruise movie, and tho' I enjoyed the book and the movie, Cruise never convinced me he was Jack Reacher.  Tom Cruise certainly is not 6'5&#34;.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Seriously? After the ending of the season, I am rapidly losing interest in this show. Is single parents going to be the new theme. Seems unlikely.
1932735410|4.0|I read the Rita PMP Exam Prep book 4 times (Rita recommends 3 times) and I did the Rita's test after each chapter two times (Rita recommends 2 times). Rita recommended reading the PMP text book 4th edition to close the remaining gap and so I read the text book twice. I also took two free online exams from other vendors. I studied for 10 weeks and I passed the exam. I'm not sure if this book is better than other exam prep books since I didn't want to over study or get confused by writer's preference. The PMP text book was difficult to understand and Rita's book was written in plain language so I'd recommend reading Rita first, then the PMP text book and then take a few mock exams.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|Seemed like it would be fun but there are no directions and I couldn't figure out what I was supposed to do.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Game is fairly challenging. Not at all too complicated yet puzzling enough to keep you thinking as you try to use your wits to solve puzzles to escape each room and move to the next. I do wish the game had more levels as it only entertained me for a couple of hours or so while playing off and on. All in all, a nicely put together app that will challenge your brain power.
B00C7O8MJ8|3.0|I really, really enjoyed the soundtrack to the &#34;first&#34; Star Trek - the reboot to the series.  &#34;Enterprising Young Men&#34; is the most frequently played song on my entire playlist.  Very uplifting.  However, &#34;Into Darkness&#34; just doesn't have the same feel.  Missing the End Credits is just being cheap.
B00004YTIQ|5.0|If you have any type of rectangular pool, and any kind of trees,<br />this is a must!  Leaves, birds, cotton woods, nothing seems to effect<br />this cover!  Next to the pool, best thing I bought!
B00A50PBEA|5.0|A really creative approach to the problem of The Magic Flute's plot.<br />Conlon's conducting moves the music well, and Rene Pape is<br />marvelous.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|First book I read since high school and Loved it! It was an easy read and kept me busy on my train rides
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Pretty fun...great graphics.has a pretty simple but interesting concept.your a monkey in tje jungle, and you have to 'slingshot' yor way up the level<br />Collecting stuff along the way
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Third book I read since high school and Loved it! It was an easy read and kept me busy on my train rides
0981951252|5.0|I would highly recommend this audio as a reminder of how to live life successfully. The free tools on Darren Hardy's website are great.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Second book I read since high school and Loved it! It was an easy read and kept me busy on my train rides
B000J10ERO|5.0|Most sequel leave alot to be desired in my opinion, but this was the exception.  I just wished they would allow him and Lois to become a couple.
B000VSAEYI|5.0|This product is of very good quality, the material is a heavy vinyl & is durable.  There were multiple air chambers to blow up, but once done looks great and kids enjoyed it.  A bonus for the kids was the sprinkler that runs the circumference of the pool.  This can be shut off if desired.  A plus, the pool was very easy to drain, deflate & folded when not in use.  Great purchase.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|What started as a great entertainment for my 3 yr old got also sucked me right into it. Great show
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Wish there were more floors.  Hope to see more soon. Was fun but didn't last as long as I hoped.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game. The only thing I sent like is that most of the time you start on the same board and the same spot. Different boards will be better but other then that I love the game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I play it on my kindle fire all the time it is perfect and soo addicting. It is a must play game.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This really fun game has a temple run/subway surfers feel to it, plus, you have to fight enemies.  The best part?  It's free!
0345525558|4.0|I liked this book even though you really want to smack Victoria a couple of times, She was flawed and she recognized it and was able to be a better person by the end of the book. Its also a commentary on the emancipation of 18 y/o foster kids, we all need to help these kids out
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This is an awesome game. Totally worth the money. I would recommend this game to  anyone who enjoys playing magic.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Nice game to play while setting at the hospital.  My nephew even enjoys it too.  Easy to understand and play.
B008220DGE|5.0|He is Jack Kerouac, he is the innocent yet haunted man in Mice and Men.  He is at once Us in our most urgent and disconsolate moment, our worst in the drunken and disembodied moment, and our most ardently self sufficient and American free spirit.  Freddie Quell is the post war search for the self,  the sensate, lost, and irreducible man of the flesh.  And in this story, he is diametrically opposed to the Master, the genius, the hope and glory and promulgation of culture and Greco-Roman philosophical fulfillment, a pinnacle of humanity, and ultimately, a fraud.<br /><br />For my full review, please visit this link, which is my blog:<br /><br />[...]
B000HKYOK0|4.0|With all the Star Trek movies, it's nice to remind myself of their origins.  My husband and I got a big kick out of the trip down memory lane, but we couldn't get our 7 and 9 year old boys into it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it goes very fast. hilarious characters and comments along the way. it had me laughing the whole time.  :) recommend to anyone.
B00BESIKWM|1.0|Boring movie with no scares at all. The action is lame as well. Carrie-Anne Moss has really fallen far from The Matrix.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I am having fun with all the quell games and strongly recommend them.  Never boring but always challenging with new twists to each puzzle.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Easy download, no issues.  It was an enjoyable read with a frustrating ending.  A very easy read by a talented author.
B009LMTDL0|3.0|I liked the book.  I apprecaited her perscpecitve on Motherhood and a working mother's.  Yes, it is a bit difficult to get psat the fact that she is highly intelligent, has a great job adn obviously makes a lot of money.  However, many of her stories involving motherhood and working mothers (as I am one as well), hit close to home.  Overall, I enjoyed the read.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|This was a great experience. I starting buying things on-line a while back and I was always careful about who I purchased from.  This time I purchased from an unknown source and was pleasantly surprised.  Product was in great shape, and super fast delivery.  I would purchase from this seller again and recommend them to others.
B00CGPPMKU|4.0|this is cool but I found that the cool factor wore off after a few days. It fun to play with when you are really bored but I have other games that I fun myself turning to more often. Still it is well executed and if you ae into this kind of art it's is definitely a good program.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome and so much fun I hope they come out with  a second game amazing horsetasticly fun and free
B002HRTMHQ|5.0|I confess I like all these young white tenors, to a point. Remy Shand made a good album for Motown, and Robin Thicke has written some other very good songs, if you like him riffing self-satisfiedly over Marvin Gaye's rhythm from \\"Got To Give It Up.\\" I thought Mayer stood alone, however, in really knowing when a song was finished or had sufficient content once the hook was in, and in capturing the lo-fi aspects not so much of Motown, but of New Jersey's legendary All Platinum label, and brother, that's going deep.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Like the lead- said: just a fun movie. I  remember reading the original comic books. They were fun. No hidden agendas, no  messages, just entertainment.
B005ZUR724|5.0|I have wait forever for a game like WoW on a moblie. We this is it people! Good game. They need expansion add on like WoW to continue the game. Gameloft you have yet again amazed us! What will you do next?
B005LAIHE0|4.0|I remember the first time saw Office Space and thought it was waste of time.  (Much like Fargo, Bridesmaids, Raising Arizona, etc....)  This is one of those films you buy, you watch, you're just not sure if you liked it or hate it.  You watch it again, you catch something funny. It sneaks up on you and before you know it, you're rolling on the floor because you 'get it'.  Give it a chance, try....you like.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|minoinrush is awesome!!!!!!! I love all the minouns you can get and I love all the diffferent levals. in the game and I like how you can go inside and outside
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved all three books in this trilogy. They really kept me involved! I was also happy to see how it ended.
B005ZUR724|1.0|Gameloft please read this, i can t even log in beacause it says i need a non exsisting update plz fix this and i will rate this game 5 stars because overall its awesome
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is awesome I love this game it is so fun an addictive. I wish I could play it all day
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is a well written, funny, sad,  intriguing  story.  It was a good read that theme is beauty isn't on the outside but what is on the inside.
B0063M22QO|3.0|I love it! It is fun to play, and I like the way it passes the time. It is colorful and easy to play. It is a great time killer
B009JZWO3I|4.0|I really liked the first 2 seasons, the 3rd and 4th seemed to have more downs than ups with occaisional episodes to keep the viewer interested. I enjoyed the 4th season overall and will give the 5th season a look.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is really enjoying and fun to play .I love this game I think this game is great for your kindle Fire and other systems.
1400067820|5.0|I bought this book as a Valentin's day gift for my boyfriend. He had heard about it before and said he wanted to read it. This made a great present for him.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I've been looking for this game a long time. Had one like it years ago. Was addiced to it. Glad to have another on my phone for those hours I spend waiting.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I have had a few different mahjong apps and this one is overall the best yet! I love it! I find it challenging yet still fun.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game never lags, never crashes, and is always playable. One of the best games out there, BUY IT NOW
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I have enjoyed this app very much! I cannot wait for more levels to explore! I highly recommend this app if you enjoy puzzles.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really like this game. I also think it would be neat if you could trade coins for diamonds or diamonds for coins.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|This is a great series! You must watch! Will keep you on the edge of your seat. I loved it!
B005GIS1SY|5.0|I watched it with my Grandkids and we all loved it. It had a lot of color and action to keep them intertained.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Great movie!  A cult classic.  I got it used but one would have never guessed it.  No skips or problems.  Very FAST service and am quite please.  Will watch it again and again for it is so FUNNY!!!
B003WJQ74E|5.0|I read this book in high school, but rereading it as an adult is an amazing experience. I love the book
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Did the author skip high school writing classes?  Boring, boring, boring.  For me, it is a total waste of money but whoever did the PR on this book should have five stars.
B00AEBB9K0|5.0|i find owen wilson in this priceless, and ben stiller is just superb. the woman lead is very touching. the silliness is just well balanced with real pathos. that lovely scene at the gas station, and how quickly things just fall apart. it's a rare film, beautifully played and i think a real classic. my daughter and i use to see it together, so maybe that is part of what i bring to it, but i just think it's one of the special movies.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I love it but I take off one star because I wish there was a faster way to give stars to ponies or a faster way to get bits. That is all
B00C7JGDBW|3.0|But Franco as Oz?!<br /><br />TERRIBLE casting!<br /><br />The others were good - Rachel always delivers!<br /><br />But overall a VAST disappointment considering the hype.
B009RH9HDS|4.0|For my wife, who had the zippered pouch version for her kindle touch e-ink version. She likes the handle loop inside for when opening the case and flipping it behind the device when reading and being able to hold it that way with one hand. So this company kept us a customers I guess when we upgraded our kindle. She loves the color and feel. She'd like to have a zipper but is happy with this.
0321934946|3.0|I have to preface this review by saying that I'm a BIG Scott Kelby fan.  I have many of his Photoshop books, and really love them.  He has a great way of explaining things.<br /><br />I was first tempted to buy the four-book package, but decided to try #1 first.  I'm glad that I did, because I don't think that I'll be buying the other three in the series.  His style of writing is still great, but I thought the book was very shallow in content.  Each page is divided into two parts:  picture on top half, and a paragraph of writing on the bottom half.  Somebody just getting into photography might find this book interesting, but I was disappointed in the content.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|ties everything up in a nice little bow. a good book considering the author passed away and someone else finished it.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|why must you ruin a great app by updating it and making it harder to use and more confusing and outside of that it is so obtrusive and I couldn't turn it off!  aweful!  go back to the old version...much better!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|One of the best shows on TV!  Can't wait for season 3 which premieres this Tuesday, July 16 at 10pm.
B0011ZNAIC|2.0|Wake me when it's over - Seinfeld is trying to hard to be \\"funny\\"....doesn't work out well for us or him,
B0013D6LEM|5.0|I bought this song because it is beautiful. I have liked this song for months. This is one of Michael Jackson's best songs.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I think this is a great game for kids of ALL ages.<br />This game is fun for girls.I love this game so much!
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Seems like the game wants to hold your hand though the first few duels but other than that it's a solid game especially for free.

0307341577|4.0|I loved \\"Gone Girl\\" (although, like I suspect most, was horribly disappointed by the ending). I found this book to be much more redemptive in the end, but Good Lord, Flynn writes some of the most bleak fiction I've ever read. Her descriptions of both 1980s and current Kansas were achingly sad and hopeless. I know there must be happy, prosperous, normal people living in Kansas but you wouldn't know it from this book. While I appreciate the character and scene building, it did leave me feeling pretty depressed most of the time. But still, the writing was great, the pacing taut, and all in all I thoroughly enjoyed it.

B00CKOQC9C|5.0|Ray Bradbury's 'The Martian Chronicles' wasn't about futuristic gadgets thought of in the mid 20th century.  In fact, one of the endearing qualities of this novel was the lack of technology and the use of what was then current and by today's standards, quite quaint technology.  However, the themes running throughout this collection of short stories, connected together as a novel, were all too familiar and never out of date. You, the reader, were confronted by the best and the worst of human behavior. This novel made you think.  It was brilliant in a most simplistic way.

B003102JDM|1.0|True, I don't understand Jewish Angst but this movie doesn't do anything to remedy that.  Nor does it provide any thing of value that I can determine.  This is a very disappointing release from the Coen Brothers.<br />I suspect if a 'Goy' (a word used many times in the movie) were to produce a movie with such negative and trivializing Jewish stereotypes he would be scathingly rebuked.<br />This movie is pretty close to the worst I've seen in several years.  Save yourself the time and money.

B00821BLX4|4.0|I bought a fisheye lens for the Olympus TG-2 TOUGH camera and realized I needed to purchase the Olympus CLA-T01 Conversion Lens Adapter to be able to screw it onto the camera.  The fit is pleasingly tight, but that also means that when you simply want to swap off the fisheye lens, and probably any other lens, and return to normal point & shoot mode, sometimes the entire housing - the fisheye lens and the lens adapter - will unscrew together, so then you'll need to unscrew the two of them to put the lens adapter back on.  The nice thing about the lens adapter is that it comes with a lens cap, whereas the TG-2 I have has no lens cap, meaning the lens is always exposed to the elements.  So the adapter has its uses simply being affixed to the front of your TG-2.

0525953590|4.0|I belong to a monthly \\"book `n beer\\" club with few rules and a penchant for eclectic selections that run the gamut from fiction to history to science. But I think the group was surprised when I suggested The Particle at the End of the Universe: How the Hunt for the Higgs Boson Leads Us to the Edge of a New World by Sean Carroll as the next book. Of the five of us, I am the weakest on the math-based science side, and memorably struggled with a Feynman selection some years ago.  I tend to gravitate towards history, politics and literature, and in the science realm my comfort zone is in plate tectonics, human evolution and climatology.  Physics, with its integral mathematical foundation, is by no means my strong suit.  Still, I've been following the Large Hadron Collider story, and the announcement that the Higgs boson had been definitively identified struck me as pretty exciting news.  Browsing at a local bookshop, I saw the Carroll book and was drawn to it.  After all, this is cutting edge stuff, right?  If I don't know as much as I should about it, I should learn.  That was my rationale when I brought the title to the group.<br /> As it turns out, I found the book accessible although quite challenging: I don't want to suggest that Particle is an easy read. For the most part, unless you have a strong background in particle physics, it is not.  In fact, I noticed that some unfavorable reviews criticized Carroll because his attempts to both describe the Higgs boson and to elucidate the characteristics of current theoretical particle physics often do not fully succeed for the layman reader.  I'm not sure that is fair. You know what?  Theoretical physics is not an easy subject. I read the entire book and I did not grasp all of the concepts.  I feel the same way when I read Stephen Hawking.  There are a handful of people out there who can describe inflation and the Big Bang Theory in a manner that even a twelve year old can grasp - David Christian of \\"Big History\\" fame comes to mind - but that is a rare talent. The Higgs boson makes inflation look like pretty elementary stuff in juxtaposition.  Should we take Carroll to task for that?  Well, I would say, yes and no, but for the most part I would give him a pass in this regard. Given the inherent complexity, I would argue that he achieves much of what he sets out to accomplish, and if a certain amount of persistence is required to navigate through the more difficult terrain, then so be it.<br /> At the outset, I should note that Carroll is an outstanding science writer, and his passion and enthusiasm for the subject is both infectious and exhilarating. To my mind, there is no doubt that he is dedicated to reaching the reader, fleshing out the topic and transmitting his own sense of awe at the universe to the average guy holding his book.  If he is not always successful, it could be because many people grasping the covers of that book have almost zero familiarity with particle physics and have not been exposed to the subject for the decades since they got out of high school or college - and most of what they once learned is entirely dated and nearly obsolete. If you don't know a lot about quarks - never mind muons - you will indeed be at a pronounced disadvantage when you read this book, despite the early chapters that try to bring you up to speed.  For the next edition of the book - and I have no doubt there will be a next edition because it is such a fine book - I would recommend a glossary of terms and a lot more illustrations that the lay reader will find accessible.  Illustrated endpapers or a fold out diagram of the standard model would be welcome. (To make up for my weak spots in this regard, I went online and found my own reference charts.)<br /> On the other hand, I would reject categorically those who claim that Carroll does not describe the Higgs boson with enough precision.  I may have had difficulty with all of the players that comprise the full constellation of particlephysics, but after reading the book I had a strong sense of what the Higgs boson does and where we would be if it did not exist.  Again, particle physics is a difficult subject.  This is not a book aimed at the lowest common denominator audience.  Rather, it is indeed directed at an otherwise educated audience that seeks to learn more about the latest in theoretical particle physics - and Higgs is absolutely the very latest!<br /> Carroll weaves the narrative about the discovery of Higgs in with the larger tale of the history of modern physics, the story behind the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) - which might have been constructed in the USA if it were not for so many short-sighted Republican politicians - and the teams of scientists that together behind the scenes engineer the great breakthroughs of contemporary science.  On the one hand, you can feel the nostalgic sadness as he pronounces the demise of the days when a Newton or an Einstein can seize glory in a single stroke; on the other, you can sense Carroll's palpable excitement as global networks of physicists work in concert to deliver the latest breakthroughs.  Some aspects of this portion of the book are more successful than others, and the \\"cutting away from the action,\\" so to speak, to tell another story can occasionally be jarring.  Still, I can see why all of these various elements are integral to the tale and why Carroll insisted on including them, even when the flow was sometimes awkwardly interrupted.<br /> As it turned out, the entire book club embraced Particle, the concepts mixed well with some high-test IPA's at the next meeting!  For my part, I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to get a handle on the latest in particle physics.  I can promise that if your science is as rusty as mine, you won't \\"get\\" all of it, but you will very much enjoy the ride.physics, but after reading the book I had a strong sense of what the Higgs boson does and where we would be if it did not exist.

0765348276|4.0|Just finished Old Man's War and must agree with some of the other reviews I found here.  I thought that the first third of the book very well done, but the remainder was a bit less well-developed.  The ideas are engaging and fresh, but the characters lost some of their earlier appeal and depth.  I look forward to reading the next one and truly did enjoy OMW today, but I really hope to see Scalzi develop the story a bit better in the next book and keep the characters up to the level he clearly demonstrated early in OMW.

1781162646|5.0|Devin Jones thought he had plans for the summer of 73. He was a student at The University of New Hampshire as was the love of his young life, Wendy Keegan. Both have university jobs thanks to the work-study program and they do everything together. Everything that is except \\"it.\\" Devin Jones thought the summer of 73 would go the same way as the summer of 72 had with both of them working on campus, her in the library and he in the Commons Cafeteria. And maybe, finally, after months of waiting and the occasional almost, \\"it\\" would finally happen. That was his plan until Wendy announced that she and her friend Renee would be working that summer at Filenes in Boston. That was not the only bombshell she threw devastating Devin. Wendy also announced that maybe the break would do them good as she said \\"'I'll miss you like mad, but really, Dev, we could probably use some time apart.\\" (Page 13)<br /><br />While he wasn't anywhere near to accepting it, Devin knew what was most likely the end of their relationship when he heard it. He also knew that a summer of mopping floors and carting dishes was not something he wanted to in the first place. With no Wendy around things would be even worse. Then, thanks to a magazine ad, Devin Jones applied to work at Joyland. The amusement park in North Carolina near the beach is far away from school, Wendy Keegan, and is a chance for Devin Jones to do something entirely different for a few short months. A place that sells fun to those who pass its gates, it also was the scene of a brutal murder long ago.<br /><br />It is also a place when Devin Jones will achieve redemption in a sense. Author Stephen King has written an incredible and deeply moving novel that tells the powerful story of one man and the lives he touched at Joyland. His actions and the reverberations of those actions fundamentally changed the course of nearly everyone's life that he came into contact with that summer.<br /><br />It wouldn't be a Stephen King novel if it wasn't called \\"a horror story\\" as it is on the back cover synopsis. Beyond the fact that the book is published by Hard Case Crime, don't let that characterization of Joyland fool you. There is a touch of the paranormal here but it is one that won't scare you though, by rights, maybe it should just a little. Something unexplained by rational objective thought is at work here, but, it never comes across scary to the reader.<br /><br />And there is certainly, as befitting the publisher, a complex mystery at foot. More than one and they will be gradually revealed over the nearly 300 page book. That mystery is a major player in the book and yet a small player for much of the novel until the final forty pages that solve the mystery and much more. This is a novel that moves slowly and gradually and takes time to develop the primary theme.<br /><br />At its heart, Joyland is a book of remembrance of things past. How what we did at 21, both big things as well as little things, will have far different meaning to us at 40, 50 and beyond. It is only later in life, decades later even, when looking back we realize how things changed at different points in our lives. Sometimes we learn dark truths when we are young. Sometimes not until we are far older. But, as the years pass and the ability to see things clearly sharpens by way of hindsight, it becomes obvious how a point here and a point there changed everything. Such is the case here in this slow moving complex tale by Stephen King. Joyland is one of those rare books that will fundamentally mean different things to readers of different ages and different perspectives. One thing that all should be able to agree on is the fact that there is deeply moving story telling at work in the book.<br /><br />Material supplied by the good folks of the Plano, Texas Public Library System.<br /><br />Kevin R.

After reading other reviews I was concerned about downloading the Kindle version, but I read it my Kindle with no problems at all.<br /><br />Do be warned, this is one of a series of at least two books (the second coming out January 2014), so its a bit of a cliffhanger!

B003L77GGA|3.0|This was a muddled finale season to an otherwise strong series.  After an amazing Season 8 and 9 with Doomsday and Zod, the overarching plot theme this season is a mysterious darkness that must be battled.  Not fully developed, this darkness randomly overtakes people and turns them evil against their will.  The evil's final action is oddly disconnected from every episode in the season, and the evil earthly minions are killed rather easily in the finale (super lame).  Allison Mack as Chloe Sullivan is in only a handful of episodes, and her presence is sorely missed.  The ongoing thread of the anti-vigilante movement doesn't make sense AT ALL because the heroes are saving people, not taking criminal justice into their own hands.  The writers work hard to try to make it work throughout the entire season, but it simply doesn't.  Like the darkness theme, you just have to pretend it works and move on.  The whole second Lionel plot is also super ridiculous.<br /><br />On the positive side of some lame plots, it's fun to see so many actors returning (why no redemption for Pete Ross, however?), particularly Annette O'Toole and John Schneider.  There are some outstanding episodes among the mix (the one where Lois gets caught in a cult is really fun), and there are elements to the finale episode that wrap things up nicely.<br /><br />It's also worth noting, for people of faith out there, that the writers take on a decidedly anti-Catholic/Christian perspective in this season and push it from beginning to end.  I'm not talking about them taking a stance again religion but attacking their followers.  One ongoing villain is named Godfrey, and his biggest supporter listens to Amy Grant and is perpetually perky.  The Darkness has chosen ones that he chooses for himself to live eternally after the darkness \\"rapture\\" day.  That's a short list.  In thinking of people I know, it was more than mildly offensive.<br /><br />Overall, this isn't the worst season of SMALLLVILLE (skip Season 4entirely), but after the build-up of Seasons 8 and 9, it's disappointing.  At the same time, if you've been with the series through the good and the bad, you'll want to see this final season even though it is one of the weaker ones.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|Read the reviews first so you know what this is about.  I enjoyed the long...journey the first time but the second viewing went fast and answered all of the questions I woke up asking.  It's about life and all it's complexities on a spiritual level.  It only presents the facts, you make your own judgments.  Great food for thoughtl

B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I use my Kindle at work and saw people playing this game so I picked it up.  Problem is it requires connectivity to the internet and given that I work on a ship that has no capability for WIFI and I can't hook it up to the ships internet it was a complete waste of time for me to download it at all.  So if you have constant WIFI on your Kindle go ahead and try.  If not.  Don't waste your time.

I think the poor Masons are finally off the hook and we can look to ourselves instead of conspiracy theories.  Well done.

B000N2HBSO|4.0|First, I loved this book!  The writing style and approach of comparing each of the mens' journeys to Lincoln's Cabinet was wonderful and fascinating!  It is the first book I've read on Lincoln's presidency!  While a long book, I thoroughly enjoyed almost all of it!  (5 stars!)<br /><br />My complaint refers to the Kindle edition: Why are there NO annotations in the text?!  It wasn't until I finished the body of the book, that I realized there were end-notes; numbered and all! There was not references to these in the body!  (I couldn't find anyplace in the body where there was an indication of these notes!! I'm sure NO publisher would ever do the same to a print version!) So how is it possible this was allowed to pass?  I wouldn't mind so much if I hadn't had to pay the full Kindle price. But having paid the full price, I expect a full (complete) book!  VERY disappointed! (1 star)<br /><br />On another point, in the electronic version, why were all the pictures relegated to their own section in the book? (at the back!) I understand doing this in a printed book due to printing signatures, but in any book design not constrained by this, I think it would be better to include the pictures in the sections of the book to which they pertained! At the very least, include a link in that section to the picture/plate!<br /><br />A great book and author!  I look forward to reading her other writings! (5 stars) However a poorly executed e-book (1 Star).

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have been hooked since the first episode. The drama combined with the suttle humor is riveting. There has not been a dull moment. (The only slight exception was a little lull in mid season 2) - but definitely worth watching. I'm really hoping for a 4th season.<br /><br />I watched the origional season on Netflix...then was disappointed with the fact they're rarely up to date. I then watched season 2 on Hulu...but still no season 3... Then I discovered Amazon Prime - which I now wish I had from the start. The point is...I went to 3 different providers only to watch this show! :)

0525953728|5.0|This is by far one of the better books that I have read that I love! If you enjoy military books this is definitely one to get, it will keep you reading late into the night and not wanting to put it down. You can relate to it if you have ever been in the military as I was.
B008XG1X18|2.0|I love pinterest but this was a little disapointing. It is constantly crashing and when you click on a pin ot doesn't let you see the whole thing. Other than those major issuses it isn't that bad.
B00DGN51O8|5.0|awesome movie good clarity its another way you can watch new movie without going to theater with family. love amazon.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game. I get so addicted to finding the clues that I overlook so many that are right in front of me. Most of the time I find everything, level 10 had me pretty stumped for awhile but I finally got it.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|I bought this game and had hours of fun with my family with it. Even my parents played a few games with us.
B00B2166BS|5.0|This is a really good investment for anyone who has purchased a Nexus 10 tablet. It charges at least twice as quickly as the standard charger, and also has the benefit of the magnetic connector that means a moment of clumsiness does not damage the tablet. Twenty dollars well spent.
0345529057|5.0|Great fantasy world and story telling. There is Royalty, sex, war, dragons, blood and gore, can't wait for the next volume.
0345803485|1.0|I usually like every book I read. From like to love, it's unusual that I dislike (let alone hate) a book. But this is the exception. On the rare occasions this happens, I can't just sit quiet. I need to shout and scream and punch whoever made this possible.<br />But since I can't do that, I'm going to write a review in Amazon and paraphrase Coach Carr from the movie Mean Girls:<br />DON'T READ THIS. Because you will waste your time, AND DIE. Don't read this on a plane flight, don't ever think this is worth 5 minutes of your time. Kids, just don't do it, promise?<br />Okay, now everybody take some Shakespeare.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|He has found his true calling. Natural!!!<br />Keep on Keepin' on!  Would pay to see him live , no doubt!
B0050DIWFC|3.0|The premise of this novel is very interesting, but the execution is lacking.  The author goes to such lengths to provide technological period legitimacy that it ends up reading like he was paid for endorsements (Twitter, Facebook, iPod Touch, MacBook, Netflix, etc., etc.) Further, he belabors the explanation of their use, particularly Facebook, to the point that it's painful for those of us who are actual users, especially since his explanations aren't always quite right. (It made me wonder if an ADA would feel the same way about his legal descriptions? Or a psychiatrist about his psychological ones?)<br /><br />The story itself is strong, well thought through and developed, and held me to the end.  It's pretty buttoned-up in terms of consistency, which made the few holes (mostly at the end, so I won't point them out) that much more irritating.  The protagonist's point of view, switching from and ADA to the parent of the defendant, was intriguing and definitely has inspired a new perspective on my part, which I appreciate.  Not my best read of the summer, but certainly not the worst. I think my disappointment comes more from the imperfect delivery than the actual story, which I honestly enjoyed.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|Love the queen. Super beautiful actor. her transition into the evil queen was amazing. Story not bad. Costumes good. ms steward good preformance.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I think this was a great move for the whole family.  Get ready to laugh out loud.  Excellent presentation and heart warming.  I would recommend this move without any reservations.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Julian Fellowes has done it again! A tour de force of British drama! Beautifully written, staged and completely engrossing. If there was a sixth star in the rating system this series would deserve it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great show from Season 1 through Season 3.  Best drama I've seen in a long time.  I look forward to next season.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|If you liked Expendables I, you'll love Expendables II ... more action stars than the first, more action overall, more knife-throwing, etc...  and an even less believable plot.  This one has a reasonably attractive Asian gal playing the lead female role, but there's no over-the-top hot chicks to make the ridiculous plot even less plausible.  All the same, it's an absurd story, but fantastically produced.  As long as you don't upset by movies that make you say, \\"Hey, wait a minute ... how did ...\\" then you'll be set.  Even kept my girlfriend awake until after bedtime!
B00005JKES|5.0|It took a few times of watching for me to appreciate Twin Peaks.  It's bizarre but so fascinating.  We enjoyed the &#34;little&#34; man.  He was so funny.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I love the songs on this disc but the biggest surprise for me was the version of &#34;The first time ever I saw your face&#34;... it moved me to tears, have so much memories of this song but this version is the best, sung with so much emotion... tears... never before heard it this emotional, this good. For me this one song makes the whole disc worth buying.
0451196716|3.0|I have read a lot of Steven King and for me this book falls somewhere in the lower middle of his work.  I liked the idea behind the book.  It reminded me of my favorite novel, 1984, and a little of Hunger Games.  The character development was excellent and it takes talent to make a story about walking interesting.  However, the ending just felt like a huge let down.  I expected to get some answers to some of my questions, but got none.  Maybe this was intentional, but it felt like King got bored with the story and just rushed the ending.
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|The entire family loved this one! Great comedy with skilled comedians! Nice mixture of E.T. Blues Brothers and MIB all in one!
B008476HBM|5.0|Truly a classic. A story I can read & enjoy time and time again. I would also recommend the movie; they did an exceptional job of bringing Austen's delightful characters to life.
B003UESJHE|5.0|I happen to love this movie! Colin Firth did an amazing job! It is funny, dramatic and keeps you interested!
B007JWKLMO|4.0|My husband liked George Harrison.  The book and DVD were a good compliment.<br />I didn't see this one myself, so it's mostly that my husband liked this.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|Cohen with his old, dark, voice and dark texts...  he is the only one and the best, just love his voice as he sings now....
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The producers of Downton Abbey seem to make a serious effort to get the period data correct, and to produce and accurate portrayal of the time.  The series is well written as a series of character studies, and the &#34;soap opera&#34; content is not excessive.  It takes me back to the days when American television attempted to do classical things well.  Alas, no more!
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|The graphics are beautiful and the game starts out simple enough to get you hooked. Finding the gems and pathways to them presents the challenge that keeps you going. A simple game for all ages, so far.
B00821PCJS|2.0|Cliched completely and utterly devoid of acting skills killed this misguided disaster.  I tried three times to watch it from the start and everytime I was DONE with it by the 3rd episode.  Dumb and dumber!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is awesome. If you feel bored or anything you need to download this game like now!!! All the floors are easy but some are difficult as all but that's the gun in it.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|I loved this book. It is incredibly interesting and his descriptions make the very colorful characters and scenary come alive.  I havre never been to Mumbai but feel as if I have after reading this book.
B0012GN0Z8|5.0|This disc has not much songs on it but oooo the quality is great! Memories of life concerts, from the best period of the E-street... just love this one.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Well, written, well produced and well acted, this drama is well worth the time to watch.  Be sure not to miss it if you like quality television.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|One of the most amazing and influential apps for either the Ipod or Android devices and its absolutely and 100% free!
B00785P2QC|4.0|Its aight. Not sure why games pressure you into spending money so hard. You do a tiny bit without it, but it could be reeeealy cool if you dropped 30 bucks on it.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I love harvey. I considered this show one of the best and this was great to watch. Awaiting season 3!! Overall 5 star
B00992CF6W|5.0|This the closest I ever got to play minecraft and it is the funniest ever in the world. If you don't have you need to get is right now
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The story got better and better.almost lost me at first chapter. Then got better. A little to much sex for me but story got good with great suspense.  Don't know how movie can be made . Be very careful who you cast.
0439023521|2.0|It amazes me how this book got so many five star reviews. I'll admit, once I got into it, I had to finish it, so I could understand all the comments about how it's so addicting. My friend lent me all three books, so I tried to read the second book as well. I got about 30 pages in before I quit reading.
B00B3HJMLM|5.0|I love Luke Bryan and have all of his CD. I think he, Chris Young and Blake Shelton are the hottest country singers today. This<br />Cd did not disapoint.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|can not wait for the next season.you nerver know whats in store from its writers.they have already killed of many of main actors.
B00003CXWV|5.0|this is a movie that is a must in any movie collection. johnny depp, penelope cruz...please! this is pure colombian coca*ne ladies & gentlemen, disco s***
B00CWVFZ8W|1.0|The only thing good about this movie were the previews.  It was a huge disappointment.  We were so glad we rented it before we purchased, so at least we didn't waste more money.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved this book and the way it highlighted mental illness and bi polar disorder in a very raw way. I would recommend this over the movie. The characters were a lot more developed and the story line was more detailed. I actually understood the book a lot better then the movie. You really get into the characters and feel for them by reading the book. I didn't get that from the movie. I love reading books before seeing the movie and in this case I'm glad I did. I don't think I would have really 'gotten' the movie if I hadn't read the book.
030758836X|4.0|I absolutely loved most of this book. It has been a long time since a book kept me up all night, and I just couldn't put this book down. The author has a very nice writing style. It was easy to read and the story line was easy to follow. I felt the characters were very realistic, and the author does a nice job of truly explaining everyone and their motivations.<br /><br />Just like so many other reviewers, the only problem I had was with the ending. I finished the book a few weeks ago and I'm still mad. That said, I would recommend this book to anyone who asks. It was a very entertaining read.
B0079R8KXG|1.0|Well the case was red, but it does not have a second fold for a stand. It is a cover only. I purchased it so that my wife could stand it up and watch it, instead of holding it all the time. Falsely advertised. It is solid on both flaps and neither side has a fold that allows it to be used as a stand. It works as a cover and does look good but it does not work as advertised.
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|Wonderful voice, good song writing and nicely produced from a 16 year old!  Hope to hear her shine musically for many years to come.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|It is so awful to think about how things used to be. This was so well written it felt like I was there with the characters, sharing in their painful lives and momentary joys.
B005G4TJI4|5.0|I received this movie in record time and I have not had any viewing issues with the picture or frame freezing.  I am really glad I decided to order Dark Moon to add to my sleection because this one rocks!  The action is awesome and as usual Shia does a fantastic job bringing the storyline to life.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|It is a very interesting story. The game is exciting. I want to play more and find out the mystery of what has happened to Anna and her family.  In
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|The name alone...hilarious. The game itself...undeniably entertaining. But there are still a few annoying glitches that keep me from giving Chimpact five stars. First issue: the focus on the character can be way too narrow at times, and even when adjusted, simply doesn't leave the player with enough room to accurately gauge a jump. Second issue: the extra &quot;abilities&quot; you can buy with bananas are sort of a let down. Specifically the ability to project your jump - hold it down too long, and you waste one. And it only shows you the projection for the one angle you're holding from; if you move to shoot from a different angle while still holding down, the projection-power is lost and you'll need to take your chances or waste one more. I dropped 15,000 bananas on that, yo! ;) All in all of course, this game is really fun and an awesome FAOTD. I'd have even paid the $0.99 asking price!
B00CWY76CC|1.0|&quot;Can You Escape&quot; is probably my second to least favorite game of all time! It has no point, and it's really hard to use. &quot;Can You Escape&quot; is a waste of time and storage. Plus, the first time I ever even opened the app, it wasn't responding. DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|When I realized I had watch every episode and there are no more yet.....man I was disappointed.  This series has great acting, very exciting, stylishly done, and very realistic. Give me more!
B0053O89JM|4.0|Great show. This was the first season I bought New as opposed to used. With that said, my brand new Xbox 360 keeps struggling to read media. Not sure of its the console or the DVD, but be aware.
B0036UMM84|5.0|I love this movie, it is so romantic and sad, I cry every time...and the music is wonderful; not to mtntion that Barbra and Kris are great.
B005LAIH2M|5.0|I ordered this movie on my directv and watched it several times,It was a must have movie it was a good investment.
B007R41E8O|3.0|Didn't love this game.  Very confusing when you are running all over the island and have to keep going back 10 steps for one piece. I try not to use my hint button but on this one I used it alot to<br /> navigate through the game. I didn't quite get the story either. Not one of my favorites.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Easy at first but becomes more challenging as the levels go up. A good game for those who like puzzles. It would be nice if there were a clue section for us less intelligent folk, though that might make the victory of solving it seem not so sweet. It would help my son though. Younger players might find this game a little frustrating.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very entertaining....Had never played a game like this. I enjoyed every moment..was disappointed when it ended. Looking forward to the next one!!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Hubby wanted the Blu-Ray, hubby got the Blu-Ray and was thrilled that I got it for him and that he didn't have to fight with me about having it on DVD, extended DVD and Blu-Ray.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I brought this book in spite of some really bad reviews.  It seems to me that some times readers forget that is it up to the author to wrap up a series.  Harris did this and left the characters older and wiser, but in a life that went on.  Some readers may have become so attached to the characters that it was hard to accept Harris' resolution.  Well worth reading if you like the series and want to let it go.
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|I loved this movie watched the trailer and said,gotta have this in my collection.Gave a copy to my daughter she loved it too.
