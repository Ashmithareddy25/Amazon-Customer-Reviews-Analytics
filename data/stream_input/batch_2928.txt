B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Amazing insight into the historical Jesus and his zealous life from which the cult of Christology was created. A game changing piece of historical research.
0553593714|5.0|Great book! Fun to read and the best storytelling ever. If you haven't started the series, start now! You won't regret it.
B00E0G5U4G|5.0|The other reviewers have pretty much covered it already. This album sounds like it could have come out a year after Heartwork. My first impression was shock that they have lost no aggression whatsoever over the many years since their heyday. As usual, one of my personal guitar heroes, Bill Steer, is true to form. Very cool riffs and excellent solos. Walker's vocals sound the same as always surprisingly. For a lifetime Carcass fan like me, this album does not disappoint at all. I hope that it has great success, and they make more. The world could always use a little more Carcass. \m/
0345803485|5.0|I was surprised that I truly enjoyed this book. I could not put it down. I  think i completed the entire book in one session. The author did a great job to entice you to pick up part2
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|AWESOME!!!!! You have to download it!!!! It is the best free game ever!!!!<br />You should save your tokens for costumes!!!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book gave me a new perspective. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. I would recommend it for light reading enjoyment.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|This is a witty and funny book, but you've got to be reasonably well-versed in Christianity, British literature and contemporary culture to get all the jokes. I laughed out loud...
B0098460O4|5.0|Two young very talented people bringing their joy of singing to the world.  It's wonderful to listen to the richness of their voices and look forward too their next CD.
0062278096|4.0|A fun read in its own right, but this is a lovely companion piece to the BBC Sherlock series. Great behind the scenes commentary from Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss, as well as funny &#34;post-it note dialogue&#34; between Sherlock and John about the different cases. Definitely recommended for any Sherlock fan.
B009G7ZYPY|4.0|Susan Boyle continues to entertain in grand fashion.  Wonderful renditions of stage music that satisfies the visual mind and the yearning ear.  I hope that one day she'll create a CD of torch songs that present the sultry quality of a couple of her songs from her first CD.
B00280LYIC|5.0|There are no words to describe how much I love this book. I wish amazon would let me rate it an infinite amount of stars because that it what I would do. No matter what age you are please, please, PLEASE read this book and the rest of the series following it. It is not only an amazing story, but it is funny, relatable (not in all aspects...) and life changing. This book series is one of the best I have ever read. If you haven't read it, do yourself a favor and read it. I promise you won't regret it. :) Happy reading!!
B000007ODL|5.0|This is one of my very favorite CDs. I never get tired of listening. JJ Cale was one of the all time greats!
B00AFEXRME|5.0|This was a exceptionally powerful movie about addiction. Denzel is one of my favorite actors and he played this part perfectly! John Goodman was also a pleasant surprise.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I downloaded this book on the recommendation of a friend. I am not much of a sci-fi enthusiast, but this book really kept my attention! I can't wait to read the next book in the series!
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|my 5 yo likes this game because he likes to get throug the jungle, but is not so concerned with getting the jewels. I then go back and replay the level looking for the missing jewels. However, we have never been able to complete a level perfectly (rewarded with the additional coins) even after we find all the jewels, so that's why i gave it four stars.
B00B69UQJY|2.0|Anyone who would give this album five stars must listen to some really boring music and has never heard Violator or Songs of Faith and Devotion.  I'm sorry, but when a group writes songs like \\"It's No Good,\\" \\"World In My Eyes,\\" \\"Policy of Truth,\\" \\"In Your Room,\\" \\"Enjoy the Silence\\" and many many others, they have no business making an album as dull and boring as this.  Honestly, I haven't been very impressed with any of their latest offerings, with a few song exceptions here and there.  To be quite honest, I LOVE Depeche Mode.  I love their videos, their songs, their live performances.  That's what makes it so hard to listen to boring, dragging music from them like this.  It's sad when my hopes of seeing them on tour consist of praying they don't play much from their new album.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|you want to download this game. For a free game, the level of graphics and style of play are fantastic. However, be forewarned--this game will drive you nuts! The speed of action tests your reflexes like no other and, even when you defeat the level's main nemisis, you still have to complete the level successfully, or you go all the way back to the beginning (it wasn't my fault i saw the arrow too late!) of course, for a nominal monetary fee, you can restart at the spot of your demise...because of this and that it won't let you move on if you die before you reach the chute, i give it 4 stars.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love everything about this book. Can't wait to start the last book. The author did a great job on these books
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Great back-up or standard alarm clock. Easy to use and loaded with special features. Love having the option to add music as an alarm option.
B00COGXGNQ|1.0|I am a sucker for love stories! The Notebook is my favorite! My husband and I both enjoyed this movie!
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Our niece loves this movie. We as adults enjoyed it too. Good buy! I would reccommend it anyone with kids to buy! Nancy
B001PJRAUS|5.0|Oh my goodness....I am so happy I purchased this movie. What a great turn on a Jane Austen novel. I think I have watched it three times already. Enjoy....
B00CATSONE|5.0|Learned so much about Nikola Tesla by reading this book.  Why is this not taught in school?  Move over Thomas as time is way overdue for Nikola to earn the recognition that he so well deserves.  Sean Patrick writes well and I would recommend it to anyone.
B006IGZWB2|4.0|The movie followed the book very closely; however the characters were not well developed. the quality of the sound was not great.
B005PK1G76|5.0|I have purchased 3 different &#34;parent consoles&#34; for my two strollers. This is the one only one we haven't sold off at a garage sale. This one is THE BEST. It's too bad it was the third one we tried, if we'd tried it first we would have been finished searching and saved money! It's thick canvas material is sturdy and cleans easily. It hold my big jug of water, my cell, and snacks with ease. The velcro straps are infinitely adjustable, which makes switching between small stroller and jogger a breeze. If you're looking for a really awesome and affordable stroller console you have found it!
B00B22ASUM|4.0|Being a cat lover, I will read practically any story with a feline as the star.  The author, who was pretty down on his luck, when he met &#34;Bob&#34; turns out to be a pretty good writer.  Who could resist this adorable cat who manages to turn the authors life around?  I couldn't and if you look at some pictures of Bob ( there is a short video on Amazon's website) you won't either.  Heartwarming and uplifting.  Try it!
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|It's a longer movie than most but I was entertained the entire time. It's a modern way to present a classic book.
0345803485|4.0|As far as the condition of the book when I got it was great and I was very pleased with it. It was exactly how I thought it would be too!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|enjoyed the original and was glad to see the new screens when the update came through.  am wasting lots of time playing Jewels Star!  :-)
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I must have looked at this book 50 times before I finally bought it and I am thrilled that I did!!  This was the best book I have read this summer!  The characters are so life like you feel like you know them and the author has a way of being able to keep track of who is who...very surprised by the book as it really was not something I thought I would enjoy and I feel like I could read this one again.  I would recommend this book for anyone who just wants a good story!
B00EL6AAEU|5.0|This film will change the way you think about aquatic amusement parks- a must-see for everyone. Some people will feel squeamish about watching it or will think it's 'too sad', but I assure you it is worth going through to know the truth. It's as unbiased as it can be, well-made, and gripping from beginning to end.
B00F35BV64|3.0|Khan Noonien Singh hijacks a Federation vessel and uses it to attack the USS Enterprise, with James T. Kirk in command.  The Enterprise triumphs through the use of a planned detonation on Khan's ship, but is put into a hopeless situation since the engines can't be fired.  One of the two main characters enters the engine room to repair it, even though he knows he'll die.  The other arrives in time to touch hands through the glass as they thank each other for their friendship, then the one that dies comes back...where have we seen this before?!  I admit, I liked the moment in the last one when future-Spock met Kirk and introduced himself with the line we all know and love.  But a single line is one thing.  Half the movie is another.<br /><br />I don't know, maybe they were going for an irony story, that the alternate timeline played out in almost the exact same way.  I just know I've never watched a movie before with the line \\"you've GOT to be kidding me!\\" running through my head so much.<br /><br />I scored it 3/5 because as a stand-alone movie it's actually pretty good.  As someone who has seen Wrath of Khan I'm considering dumping it in the trash.  Whoever the writer for Wrath of Khan was should seriously consider a plagiarism lawsuit; it's seriously pathetic.  The moment Spock was screaming \\"KHAN!\\" I finally gave up on this movie.  Unbelievable.  I've seen remakes and sequels try to cash in on their predecessors but this is a whole new level of plain reeking of trying to just replicate something else.  At the end Kirk actually recites the \\"5-year speech\\".  Anyone associated with making this movie who has any knowledge of Star Trek should be ashamed of themselves.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Always a great read in this classic book.  Grate for every age and reading genre.  Will read again and again.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|This book will not disappoint readers wanting to find out what happens to the main characters. The descriptions of humanity and the interconnectedness we have in extended families comes alive on the pages of this book. I found it frustrating, disturbing, challenging, heartbreaking all in such a good way. You felt a part of this fictional family and I wanted it to never end.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I enjoyed this book.  It was creative and interesting.  If you liked the book beautiful creatures you will like this.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This is one of the best games ever for a kindle I enjoy playing the game and my friends love the game tho.
0547884591|5.0|Tim Ferriss is one of a kind. His guidance is motivating, practical, and proven time and time again; nothing demonstrates his essence better than &#34;The 4-Hour Chef&#34;!
B00ANKV5V0|4.0|It's very cute shoes for kids! My daughter loves the color and design. That's a shame I had wrong size, but I'll give it to friend and order the new one for my daughter.
B00DUL3VFM|5.0|I saw it years ago before they created a series out of it.  My 11 year old was very much into the movie as well as my brother in law from overseas.  Very well done movie
B001BANK32|5.0|I picked this book up again but this time on the kindle to revisit a classic in anticipation of its upcoming 36 years in the making sequel & it still manages to blow my mind.
B009MJU8P2|5.0|My daughter adores Schleich products. They hold up to our busy, destructive household. She plays with them all the time, takes them outside, slops them around the bathtub. They are still going strong.
B00EQ0CKRQ|4.0|I feel like the rating system of the cars throws the game off a little bit. Other than that one of the best games on the mobile market
B0052UYJDC|5.0|For one dollar, you can't beat this. Multiple, short sections on minimalism including the philosophy, tips to get started, and inspiration to embrace the lifestyle. If you are new to minimalism, focus on the philosophy and inspiration sections. You'll get great tips on decluttering, too, but you must embrace the lifestyle first. Letting go of an attachment to &#34;things.&#34; Abandoning the &#34;just in case&#34; trap. There is also sections on minimalizing your life. As in, letting go of commitments and &#34;schedule packers&#34; that aren't really right for you.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Very addicting and fun game. I could play for hours and not even realize it. It will keep me up all night.
B00CRWJ7VC|4.0|For most, this movie will come across as a complex tale which seems to be in disarray. For others, it is a beautiful journey artfully shot with a riveting message of personal reflection. Say what?<br />What not everyone will realize is that this movie is actually capturing the past life regression of many souls. To appreciate that, understand that past life regression is about recognizing and overcoming the challenges our souls have consistently faced throughout our lives (yes plural if you believe your spirit has been here before). This movie, if the viewer is keen to recognize such a thread, details the challenges faced by each incarnation of the souls focused on throughout this movie - greed, cowardice, courage, bravery, slavery, death, love, loss and so on. In some lives, you win some, and in others, you lose some.<br />The movie isn't shot in disarray as much as it is showing you the similarity of a situation, or challenge a character faces throughout the ages. Ie: a character may make many mistakes and commit crimes against humanity/nature in one life (or two or three), while in another, they may actually do something valiant and different from what they had done before. Watch as Tom Hanks greedily goes after a little gem, like Gollum with his precious.<br />So whether you take this movie as a great story packed with an insightful message (thank you Wachowski's for picking such a poignant story to capture on film), or the artful tale of a book turned to film, or just a confusing bunch of clips sewn together with a great cast, you will be in for a wild ride of make-up mastery and some cool special effects.
0553801503|5.0|The seller mailed the book quickly and I received it in two days. The book is great, the cover is a different version of this book which I have never seen before, and I like the new cover! Thank you very much.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|This is a joyous film. Disability is handled with empathy and humor. A remarkable story of two remarkable and involved people.
B00EYN3HTA|5.0|Fun, interesting and some downright creepy poems.<br />If you are a lover of poetry and dig the different this is perfect for you.<br />A lot of it mirrors the book, Peter - A darkened fairytale. As such it gives me the same Alice in wonderland feeling. Making it feel already familiar yet tossing in a new twist.<br /><br />Wonderful. I enjoyed it greatly.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|Was alright. Definitely a rental. Wouldnt buy. Storyline could have been much better. It was still enjoyable. Fun to watch
B008YKGQR4|1.0|This app only tells me it has stopped working, every time I try to open it. It is entirely UN-usable!!!
B005LAIIN0|5.0|Max Brooks himself was not expecting a perfect book to film transition. If you read his comments about the movie, he was happy to see a fresh perspective on his world he created (even though a few of the world's dynamics are different between book and film). Also, if you look at Brooks' motivation for writing this novel and it's predecessor, you'll understand why he would be happy with this film (other than the fact that he scored a million of off movie rights when Plan B bought rights a few years ago). His entire point that he is trying to make is that we need to be better prepared. He has an undying passion to warn others and to be prepared for anything that could come. He doesn't necessarily think that zombies are going to shoot up out of the ground (although he doesn't seem to rule out the possibility), but he is sure that we as a race are vulnerable to something similar that really could wipe out a large percentage of our population. It was his manager that published his first book as a satire, The Zombie Survival Guide. Brooks didn't want it to be a satire. He was very serious about the contents of that book (again, maybe not in a literal \\"zombies are coming\\" way, but in a \\"we need to be more careful\\" way). This may be an extreme view that many see as a paranoia, and I personally don't adapt this fear, but the point is that Brooks' had a message to convey and those who watch this movie correctly will understand what that message is. Watch it a few times, there are small comments and camera shots strategically placed throughout the film which masterfully delve into this \\"We need to be prepared\\" message. Well done Mr. Pitt.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|I like writing so this is handy for all sorts of blogging, notes, etc. It gives me a way to organize my writing and provides a simple to find notebooks.
0385528787|5.0|Dig that palindrome! Sequel to Oryx & Crake and The Year of the Flood, this is the story of the people who survived the Waterless Flood, and brings together the God's Gardeners and the Crakers, and the pigoons, and some Painballers, and gives out Zeb's backstory, along with a lot of other stuff you wanted to know about the Maddaddamite world. Fabulous, of course.
B004GFN11A|5.0|Word press gives me the tools I need to write and correct my wording as well as add graphics to make my blog look nice.
B00E0SX118|5.0|This movie is entertaining and enjoyable for all ages. It's fresh and colorful, amusing and touching, with an underlying positive message.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Facebook is where I hang out a lot. I am glad to have it on my Kendle Fire. Thanks for this app.
B00EEDJM2Q|3.0|Overall this is a fun little game, but the graphics jump on the screen....most disruptive. Would love to see scores from the main grid and not just a check mark.  With these changes, I would give this game 4-5 stars.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|easy to use.  fun to play.  nice that it connects to facebook.  would recommend it to others.  That is it
B005R2PDL2|5.0|She has a beautiful voice and her music is perfect for meditation, relaxation, exercise, whatever. Her music is soothing and calming and helps me to focus.
B005MMY9A8|3.0|I have to say at the outset that it was my husband's choice of movie for the night and I mentally rolled my eyes. However, it actually was okay. A little strange, as these &#34;comic-based&#34; movies tend to be, but there was an actual plot that you could actually follow and there was even a little humor. I would rent it.
B005D9MUWY|2.0|I have had SwiftKey through all of the name changes and updates in the past but now it is suddenly counterproductive.<br />You have to click on the same words and letters several times before it recognizes it and it no longer saves your smilies and things that it used to it familiar sentences. It will not save them in theqquick rows at all as a matter of fact.<br />You still have the smilie quick screen, but it will never prompt you for one as a suggestion any more like it used to no matter how much you use it.<br />Touching words and letters and watching them highlight, so you know that it was chosen and have your phone do absolutely nothing is extremely frustrating also now and it has been doing it very often.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|First I saw TV series and then got intrigued! Book tells you so much more, than TV!<br />Helps to visualize stuff on your own. Loved the book!
0226264211|5.0|Outstanding and thought provoking.  Should be required reading for all to get an understanding instead of the current myth of fairly land for all.  Healthy future depends on healthy logical rational thought.  Get it and share with family and friends.
B005ISZRES|3.0|Actually I havent read book yet!<br />Didnt  catch at first! But i am planning geeting on to it soon again!
B007N31YH0|5.0|A pleasant cinema experience to be enjoyed by all.  Made for a delightful evening with Mr. Orville Redenbacker by my side.
B005YDLJ76|3.0|The concert was great of cours, there is no doubt, but priduct wasnt that good. Both of the DVDs had problems scaning on DVD player and on my notebook. Looked like it was alreday used and scrached!
B009YQJ322|5.0|An excellent big screen adaptation of Judge Dredd from the comics. Much better than the Stallone version. The violence is pretty graphic though so, maybe not for the kids.
B00F35B8F8|4.0|The first 20 minutes or so was starting to lose me, but it picked up after this initial back-story and character updating was done.  I'll still wait to buy it later, after the price comes down.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Fabulous and entertaining show. Characters are well written and keep you coming back for more. On to season three for me.
B00915G6MG|4.0|A wonderful 10th season.  Hope they film 10 more.  Have been watching and buying the tapes since they first sold them.  The only thing that was dissappointing, was that this years tapes were not in plastic covers, but in cardboard.
1781162646|5.0|This is King at his best. The perfect book for the summer. Good pace and well developed characters. Joyland is the perfect back drop for a great coming of age tale. If King has one strength, it's being able to wrap you up in a blanket of nostalgia. Highly recommended!
B00DAPOHU6|5.0|Another great cd from Jack Johnson.  This is much more mellow than I expected but I didn't know what to expect.  Jack is a master at word craft and melody.  Another great cd that will not disappoint.  Great addition to any collection.
B005544V6A|5.0|Great story line and just the right balance of seriousness and humor.  Love the characters and how they've been developed.  I'm now addicted!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I loved the writing style, the characters and the story. I was disappointed with the profanity. I feel that using profanity showed a lack of class for the charters, and based on their personalities, it was gratuitous and unnecessary. I'm hoping there is less or no profanity used in this author's other books.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|I missed episode 6. I realized I could purchase this from Amazon. I think this one of the best series. on TV.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|As I dashed through the first two volumes, I found myself not wanting the story to end. I don't want to spoil any secrets here so all I will say about the ending is that it is like two friends who moved away to the other coast, only to be seen at future weddings and funerals. What lovely tension between these two. I can only hope that they don't disappoint with a lame movie version. Christian, where were you when I was young?<br />I recommend to a reader who wants complete escapism for three books. This is not a naughty book in my view but a love story acting sexy.
B000EXDS5M|5.0|When one can recruit the two stars in a movie - do it. It can never be done again. Based on a real couple of characters is where it begins.  there after that - well it is all adventure and  plenty of fiction.  Delighted that I bought it and even more grateful to have it in my collection!
B007THA4FI|3.0|I am a huge Harry Potter fan and so I was very excited to read this book.  I was disappointed when first starting the book as it took a while to become engaged.  As I read through the book I found that I enjoyed it more but it was certainly not on my list of great reads.
B00ANYJ3NI|5.0|Mr. Lewis while grinding his own ax a bit, has created a wonderful work exposing the emperor's tailors, and exalting those with the vision to profit from the deceit.  My only wish for this book would be for Mr. Lewis to have further determined to what degree those companies issuing synthetic derivatives actually understood them and to whom they were sold.  It seems pension funds ended up carrying most of the water in this mess.  Maybe fodder for a follow up?
B001N3GUIE|5.0|This movie is one of the best older science fiction films of all time. The DVD is great and the purchase is well worth it.
B0024FADAQ|5.0|I love this movie. This is one of the first I remember seeing in theaters. The score is epic. The graphics, though dated, don't keep you from enjoying it now. And who still doesn't love Maggie? Should they reboot it? I don't know. Should you make this part of your collection? YES.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is a great game. not to challenging but not too easy either. just right to stretch the mind but not to frustrate it
B0060CXAHC|4.0|How can you not love lilo and Stitch, Lilo is a great little character. This is a blast for the entire family.
B0042FZOFU|4.0|The package came quickly in great condition. We were not aware that it was a European release of the movies, although it doesn't affect the movie itself, it would have been nice to know from the beginning.
B005ZMUWWY|4.0|Great movie, lots of feels without much dialog. A very nice movie a great watch for the entire family. You simply have to love it.
1442359919|5.0|\\"Joyland,\\" Mr. King's latest effort, is a great read (or listen, as I did it, on audio CD's downloaded to my iPod).  Congrats as well to Michael Kelley, the narrator, who does a great job himself!  You'll love Dev (Devon) Jones, and all the others in the tale; all are realistic, true-to-life (at 65, I remember 1973 very well, myself -- and Stephen, you should have also mentioned that 1973 was the year of Secretariat; can't believe you forgot that!).  Ignore as well a couple of Libtard throw-away lines, and the remainder of the book is engrossing, suspenseful and near un-put-downable (if that's a word)!<br /><br />I recall Mr. King commenting a few years ago on Sarah Palin's calling Obamacare's IPAB a \\"Death Panel,\\" and dissing her on that.  Uh, oh!  Looks like she was right, wasn't she, Stephen (even Howard \\"Dr. Demento\\" Dean thinks so).
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|Great story love the ending and the what ifs makes you think. Easy to read good fall book. I enjoyed it all
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This has always been my favorite and I can't wait until the new season returns  It is a good family show as well.  I love the vintage settings and the clothes are interesting as well.
1936608898|4.0|I liked how this book explained the science behind a trendy diet, it's hard to argue when they make such a good case for the paleo diet. Sure, there may not be enough evidence to support their claims 100% and some of their patient stories seemed a little far-fetched but overall great, thought-provoking read for those looking to improve their diet.
B004UID2LC|1.0|its a terrible app for the kindle fire, the set up is solo dumb and your better off just using web.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|I have found many new interest buy using Flipboard, I  can keep up with current events from a variety of interest.
B009YQJ322|5.0|Dredd was an amazing action flick from minute one on. The pacing lines up with the way that Judge Dredd comics read perfectly in my opinion. Mega City looks the way you would expect it to and really feels like the overpopulated hell hole that you see in the pages of 2000 AD. And finally, the rating means just what you think it does. This film is heavy, dark, violent, and definitely intended for adult viewers...and the results are amazing. Watch the film. Buy the film. And prepare yourself for sentencing because you will be found guilty of negligence if you fail to comply and the sentence will be a lifetime of regret.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|I don't use it much but it does makes the little bit of stuff I do have easy to find.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I found this a great way to read the bible.  I picked a version of the bible that could be played.  That way I could listen and follow along in the written word.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|A very funny and refreshing way to show all the shades of FUp we all are deep inside and that in the end if we have faith and truly believe it, it all works out in the end. I fell in love with both Ana and Christian. Not at all what I thought I was going to read from all the comments I had heard!! I totally LOVED the books because of the way the author made me feel like I was part of the story.
B00000JFV9|5.0|One of those masterpieces that is a &#34;must have&#34; for any music lover.This man produced one heck of an album that was unmatched by few others.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I chose to read this book because of previous great reviews from other readers, all the while a bit sceptical of their interpretations.  I can truly report that I'm hooked!  I couldn't put it down and have now downloaded the entire series!  This story line is extremely clever.  I'm typically not a fan of this genre, but this book is so well written and interesting.  I can't wait to have my husband read this - I know he'll love it too!  Now on to the next one without delay...
0307743659|5.0|I grew up in Colorado, so eventually reading \\"The Shining\\" at some point was unavoidable.  The Stanley Hotel, the inspiration for the Overlook, is infamous for being the most haunted spot in the fair Centennial State, and although from personal experience I find the Hotel Glenwood in Glenwood Springs to be much creepier, there is not a Coloradan worth his/her weight in microbrews who has not driven past the Stanley in Estes Park, turned to whoever they were with, and intoned \\"Redrum!\\" \\"Redrum!\\" in an eerie monotone.  Working one's finger up-and-down like \\"Tony\\" from Kubrick's film adaptation is optional.<br /><br />I first read this book in high school close to ten years ago, sitting in the library with a battered paperback edition held about an inch away from my nose.  Despite being in a cozy, well-lit public space in broad daylight, this book terrified me like no other novel ever has.<br /><br />The story is fairly well-known, but let's rehash it, just for fun: Jack Torrance is a struggling writer, ex-teacher, and recovering alcoholic who is still wrestling with the demons of his past, among them an abusive father and his own latent violent urges toward his wife Wendy and five year old son Danny.  For better or worse, however, Jack loves his family, and believes the recent move from Vermont to Colorado will be good for them.  When he takes a job as winter caretaker for the historic Overlook Hotel nestled in the heart of the Rocky Mountains, Wendy is thrilled, but Danny, who possesses a clairvoyant gift dubbed \\"the shining\\" by the hotel's chef, Dick Halloran, is not so sure.  As the snow begins to fly, the Torrance family soon realizes that they are not totally alone in the Overlook; the hotel is populated not only by the spirits of certain guests who checked in but never checked out, but also by a deeply malevolent, disembodied presence that wishes to use Jack and Danny for its own evil purposes.  Terror and shocking violence ensues as Jack eventually succumbs tothe seductive darkness of the hotel, and his family must rely on their own strength and wits if they want to have any hope of getting out alive.<br /><br />This is a chilling book in every sense of the word. King has always been a master of creating three-dimensional characters, and his portrayal of Jack, Wendy, Danny, and Halloran make you fall in love with all four of them, and thus feel the full tragedy of what happens during the book's third act.  While the book is certainly scary for all of the fun haunted-house reasons--dead lady in the bathtub, disembodied voices, things moving on their own, etc.--what really always scared me the most about \\"The Shining\\" was the portrayal of a dysfunctional but loving family coming apart at the seams.  Jack's treatment of Wendy and Danny while under the thrall of the Overlook carries with it frighteningly realistic echoes of every-day domestic violence, confirming King's assertion that all evil, be it in the form of Jack the Ripper, Hitler, or a drunken husband, is banal.<br /><br />Once again, I read this book at fifteen, and seven years later, it still holds up.  \\"The Shining\\" also the perfect novel to read if you're new to King's library; along with \\"Carrie,\\" \\"'Salem's Lot,\\" \\"The Stand,\\" and \\"IT,\\" it's considered one of the essentials.  If you haven't read this book yet, I envy you the experience of staying in the Overlook with the Torrance family for the first time. Prepare for many sleepless nights, and to never look at a bathtub or a croquet mallet quite the same way again.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|It's crazy how addicting a series can be. Can't wait to pick up the next one. Cassandra does a great job pulling a reader deeper into a story.
B009GED3HS|5.0|u got entertainment, friendships, diversity of characters, a hopeless romantic, a womanizer, a non-committal career woman and a semi-normal couple..its a fun show, also Barney is such a dynamic character...cant believe he is gay in real life!!
0802473156|5.0|i read it a few years ago before i met my fiance'.  we ran into a wall where i felt he wasn't hearing me and i remembered this book and bought it for him.  he got a lot from it and has began to make little changes that i can see.  Thanks Gary Chapman
B006M4F67A|4.0|The first two sets are free and then you have to buy them. Lots of challenge to get the 3 stars for each puzzle. Keep me entertained for hours when I was immobilized.
B00DHNAQ2Y|5.0|I was young [younger] when the first Evil Dead came out & I thoroughly enjoyed it but the remake is excellent. I hate to say it but it's better than the original E.D. This is scary as hell. The makeup & special effects are light years better than 1981, really creepy. I wanted it, I bought it and I'm glad I did. I'm picky about my video library but Evil Dead/ 2013 is a great addition.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Very interesting how they pull off the tricks. It had a good action scene and fight scene. I would recommend
B003LSTK8G|5.0|I learned a lot about the characters involved in this mortgage crisis. I think these people are genius in figuring out how to go against conventional wisdom to score huge profits. But I would also argue that the author did not dig deep enough. The root cause of this crisis came from the government mandate of the \\"COMMUNITY reinvestment act.\\"
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love playing this game. It's a good work out for my mind. Got into it by playing with my granddaughter.
B00F35BV64|4.0|The movie was entertaining. Good acting. Characters a bit over the top but this comes with the territory. Not sure what darkness was visited. Overall I give it 3.5 stars but my wife scored it lower at 2.5
B008XKSW7M|5.0|I enjoyed watching it. It was pretty funny. However I think it is more for women than men. That said, I would probably watch it again in the future.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Favorite game ever! Just wish the payout would go up with the expensive rooms, hard to keep playing without having to purchase
B0008ENICU|5.0|Being a Rosalind Russell fan I knew I was going to be pleased.  It was very interesting watching a full length movie and not seeing one male throughout the entire movie. Though filmed in black and white, the fashion show was a total surprise!  It is well worth the money spent.
B009KWU6Q2|5.0|Love Hook! Glad to be able to see it in HD and to have the chance to enjoy it again
0743298039|5.0|Bought this for my Kindle and liked it so much, I bought the book for my daughter.<br />A  must read!!
B00ADQCBEY|2.0|i started watching this show to see walton goggins after watching Justified.  He's a great actor, but the writing in this show doesn't begin to match justified.  and the lead character?  I couldn't car less what happens to him, so i quit watching the show.  The star reminds me of a banty rooster.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Grandson loves it. Into Mindcraft big time and all that Lego has.Looking forward to Robots coming out to challenge him.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Careful... this game is addictive! the more you play the cooler the dragons get and more combination are available.<br />its not like farmville, where if you don't keep logging on your plants will die, in dragonvale they just stop earning money when the habitats are full but the dragons don't need to be fed all the time!(although i still log on and check my dragons what seems like every 2 seconds!)<br />this game is a must have!!!!
B00632HWOG|5.0|I couldnt live without my YAHOO.  I love that I can link more than one account and flip back and forth without having to log in every time.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Very entertaining. The characters are very believable and now I can't wait for the next season.  I will buy it as soon as it is available.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It is impossible not to love this app.  i share pictures and stary connected with family.  It is great for staying connected
B004LRNYJW|5.0|Gripping, disturbing, excellently crafted film that (at times) puts you at odds with your morals.  Highly recommended for horror fans.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I lOVE this game.  It has become my new addiction.  i still have a lot to explore but what little i have played so far I love.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I've watched every episode, this is my favorite show on tv. I have all seasons so far except season 8.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I enjoyed it very much, fantastic special effects, and great story line, I have nothing bad to say about it.
140006922X|4.0|Good historical research. For anyone who is thinking of setting aside the biblical account of Jesus should read Mr. Aslan's book.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Enjoyable action movie that was a lot of fun.  Have seen it twice now, even my girl friend enjoyed it.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|the writers complicated the seasons with the introduction of so many characters within a few episodes but otherwise a wonderful season. I can't wait to see season 3.
B003DF44Q0|5.0|A great buy,my son had never seen it, now it is one of his favorite movies & at a great price
B00BMNM4H6|4.0|It's very addictive and strange at the same time..<br />Buy it because Bonte (the developer) is great!<br />Let'ts save all the sugar!
B005LAJ16I|2.0|Although the First Season is riveting at times, the pornographic sex scenes were shocking (and without warning).  It was NOT something I expected (or wanted) to see, let alone if there had been any children or teens in the room.<br /><br />The plot was interesting. The ending was a brilliant shocker.
B004P1JEXE|4.0|I was fascinated by this series from the start- although this kind of fiction is not generally what I read.<br />I find the structure - separate chapters for different characters - at times a little bit  irritating, as it is difficult to remember what a particular character was doing the last time you encountered him or her in the books.<br />The names are also at times somewhat annoying and, in some cases, impossible to remember, which doesn't make following the plot any easier.<br />But in general the book is grippingly written in a clean, economical but at times very poetic prose. There is a real feeling of an epic or some ancient saga about these books. I am so looking forward to reading the final one(s) when they have been written.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|I still miss this series.  Although it was time for LOST to end, there is a strong, after-life message for all of us to contemplate.  No spoiler here...
B00E0G5U4G|5.0|It's safe to say we've all been waiting quite awhile for this one.  And man oh man was it worth the wait.<br /><br />Steer's rhythm guitar work, running the gamut from speed metal licks to thrash riffs to melodic hooks to tremolo picks, is superlative.  Walker's rasp & lyrical wizardry are in top form.  The drumming is tight.  The production is slick.<br /><br />So far I'm liking all of the tracks.  I'm trying to find a weak link in the bunch and so far I'm not finding it.  The only one that I will call out by name is the surprising 8+ minute final track, \\"Mount of Execution\\", and its throwback to NWOBHM/early thrash riffs & imagery; in terms of Carcass' own history, and given the song's slower pacing, it's more like a track from the Swansong era than anything else.  This is not a bad thing - this is a top track.<br /><br />And lastly, I might add, it's also great to hear Bill Steer's guttural growl return on some backing vocals.  Haven't heard that since the Necroticism days.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Carcass then I'd wager that it's almost impossible to be disappointed with this album.  So go buy a copy!
B007FTZDN8|2.0|Can be good at times, but for the most part just watching people that are interested in impressing you with their knowledge, or lack thereof.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I was not sure what I was getting into but my kids said that it was good.  They were correct. We are all a little crazy,
B00B7Y0206|4.0|Displays videos that can or can not be relevant and worthy of viewing. Good if you are a visual learner.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I loved all the characters and the ending. I can not wait to see Despicable Me II.  both my wife and I loved it,
B000F6IOC0|5.0|Thank God I enjoyed whole scenes. In some part of Asia, there's some cuts & sometimes blur added for some reason. Mostly violent, sexual, or racial stuff.
B005HSG3TC|2.0|I would like to have it be more protective of my Kindle - perhaps with more light foam?  I find that even with<br />this cover, I have to carry it in a bag or protective case which kind of defeats the purpose.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|They were great! I wonder how series go after that last scene!!<br /><br />Do I have to wait another year for the next?? (I guess I must.. if I don't get a chance to move<br />to the States to watch next season.)  Sigh..
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is a great game and keeps you interested with the different types of pictures.bought it on my kindle and play daily.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really fun game. Thinking involved and had to get help but very playable game.<br />Highly recommended. Am going to look forward to more of these gAmes.
B004VOBIE8|4.0|This app works great! Just wish the developer would remove the &quot;Internet Needed&quot; portion of the app as it interferes with the playback of movies and documents. The other thing is that, I would wish that the developer would put out a &quot;paid version&quot; of this app (Professional Version). I recommend this app to all Kindle and Android Tablet users.
B005PK57IK|5.0|I truly enjoyed all show so far I hope the writers continue giving us great story lines. I am looking forward to season five (5)
B005VPRG10|5.0|Very pleased with this! It sure ooks great, and it was fun to build. A wonderful addition to my collection.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I don't have time during the season to watch, nor do I have cable but looking at all the passed seasons have been Great! looking forward to the holidays when I can catchup with season 5.
B00E978FGQ|3.0|cool home dvd movie. i would not have felt it was worth it to go out the house but in my chair at home it's good
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|I enjoy playing this game on my kindle fire.It keeps me entertained and out of trouble most of the time.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Good game - really glad I took the time to down load this game. It is really really good fun to be honest
B008B8DWDU|5.0|Brilliant story! I really didn't expect it to be so fantastic! Thank you so much Chris Colfer for this amazing book!
B00ECUARO8|3.0|This was a pretty good movie. The plot was a bit thin but interesting none the less. It was a good ending, no spoiler alerts.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Omg i read this in less than a day..... thats just crazy good. Amay zzing o m g... read it now
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Started out with the free version and we loved it. Especially the ability to download extra sounds from their blog. Just yesterday decided to update to the paid version because of all the extra sounds available and no regrets! The alarm clock with fade is a particular fave with us.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|I remember reading this book in school but really enjoyed reading it again  now in my later years. It still as captivating as it was back then. Once you start it you can't stop until you are at the end.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|I give this album five stars because it is one of the best 2 disc collections you can get of &#34;Fleetwood Mac&#34;.  All 36 songs are golden and I have played both discs over and over again.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Great book loved it could not it down nice easy reading.  Fell in love with all the characters would recommend saw the movie also
B003UESJ9M|3.0|I purchased &#34;Country Strong&#34; because I was told it was a great movie.  I already had &#34;Pure Country&#34; , &#34;Crazy Heart&#34; and Tender Mercies and thought this was like the above mentioned movies, and seeing that a hottie like Gwyneth Paltrow was in it sparked my interest, but the movie was not very good and pailed in comparison with the above mentioned other three movies.  It was the worst of the three.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the cheese, this game is the best. If I were to pick a game to play when ever I could, it would be tis magnificent app. For any one who doesn't know what this app is, your mind will be blown away
0385523394|5.0|The book came in excellent condition and on time. I haven't read it yet, but after watching the series I am very excited to start reading this one!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I loved the way she structured the storyline. By the end I was invested in each character. I loved how she ended it.
B005D63ICI|5.0|Great quality, affordable, you get access immediately...I love Dexter!! 2nd time I've bought episodes and love it, would highly recommend it!
1476734941|4.0|While the recipes are good, they're not easy to prepare.  There is a lack of fresh food where we live making it difficult, but it's not really the fault of the book, just partly.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|My two year old loved it, and watched it all the time while we had it on rent. Amazon made it vary easy to rent and access.
B000NGTJTY|5.0|This movie has such intriguing twists and turns and suspense. The way the two main characters morals and experiences directly oppose each other makes the movie compelling to watch.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Fun, sensual, and scary to examine a world I've only ever heard about. Erotic and educational at the same time. Loved watching the characters move closer to creating a new world as they began to understand each other.
B00E34A9FU|5.0|First off this long bootlegged ,almost mystical concert for Deadheads is first rate. Personally,this is my favorite Dead era,despite Donna Godchaux's screeching.The set list is superb, with Bertha and an epic dark Star.the boys were not yet {in}famous in the god like way they became later, so they were able to fool around and enjoy themselves.It shows in the playing. a bit too much weir for my tastes[i have always suspected he is the Mike Love of the Dead],still a great great show,a superb bookend to the Europe 72 box st.The Ddv is a huge upgrade in both sound and picture quality.The crowd in an unusally hot day in Oregon are often dancing about as they came into the world,so many of those woman, obviously,er,enjoying themselves are so sunburned it make you wince, especially since the band keeps reminding people to hydrate ,etc.A fun glimpse backward, when everyone was still with us{Kesey and Garcia} and there was a quite familiarity to Dead concerts.i would call this one essential for deadheads,though that is redundant. Hugely recommended,and a helluva lot of fun
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love this show.  Trying to catch up so I can watch season 4.  Great show for anyone.  Very good plot.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|The book starts out moderately exciting and stays moderately exciting throughout. Nothing particularly new or interesting about this work which weaves together demons, vampires, werewolves and warlock presence with the demon hunters who operate on special runes and other technologies to balance the destructive forces in the world. The book has a surprising twist at the end that is very much like the twist in the Star Wars series where romance is involved. Worth checking out if you are looking for some mindless entertainment, most appropriate for teens and young adults.
B00E95ED32|5.0|You don't have be into EDM to enjoy this album, Avicii has definitely taken house music to another level!!! Hands down best house DJ ever!!
B00ET7EON4|5.0|Mmm. Good stuff. Really enjoyed this album. I've enjoyed Arctic Monkeys for a while now and I'm glad they still have &#34;it&#34;.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|One of the best shows I have ever seen! It was a little hard at first to get into the series but once the relationships started to develop between the characters I couldn't stop watching!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Everything i down load it reads in seconds alot of down loaded documents from my place of work really neeed this
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This is the best story.  I love the characters.  We have neighbors and friends that are all addicted to this.  We can't wait until January until the next season is available.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|BBC Broadchurch. Excellent acting, writing and directing!  This series is definitely a winner! We are looking forward to future shows.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Kept me so entertained I couldn't stop watching. I plan to watch all three seasons. Nice to have something to do on rainy days.
B005NFJAT4|1.0|The movie may be OK but it will not play on my blue ray machine.  I do not know what to do.  Please help.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's a great game for kids and adults. One bad thing is a lot of time is spent waiting on loading...
B0030B621W|5.0|I enjoyed this movie so much that I watched it twice in the same week. Sam Rockwell does a phenomenal job and this is a must-see for any sci-fi buff.
B005LAII80|5.0|Crushed I didn't get to see this in the theater. Well worth your money for the amount of times you will be watching it. Support a Sequel! #dayofdredd @DreddSequel
1423140605|5.0|The Mark of Athena was an amazing read. The story begins with the Greek warship, The Argo II, floating towards the Roman demigod camp. The two camps combine to fulfill the Prophecy of Seven, and the story takes off.<br /><br />  Like the last two books, The Mark of Athena has multiple points of views. Each chapter is written from the perspective of a different demigod in the Prophecy of Seven. Frank and Hazel's perspectives were left out, though seven different perspectives would have caused the story to become very confusing. I liked being able to understand how each character thought and felt, because it provided multiple mindsets on each situation. It also helped me to better understand and connect with each character individually.<br /><br />  The seven demigods are determined to pass through the Mare Nostrum, defeat Gaea, kill two twin giants, and save a fellow demigod from a bronze jar all in less than a week. On top of all of this, Annabeth must go on a solo quest to follow the Mark of Athena in her mother's name, a task no child of Athena had ever survived. She was guided by the red owl, a symbol that appeared frequently throughout the course of the story.<br /><br />  I really enjoyed all the unexpected twists that occurred during the story, because reading a book where you can predict every event about to happen is, well...boring! I am anxiously awaiting the next book in this series, because this one ended in the biggest cliffhanger ever! I recommend this to anyone who has even sort of enjoyed the rest of the Percy Jackson books. The Mark of Athena is definitely my favorite book in the series.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Just introduced to the Jack Reacher series & can't get my hands on enough of them.  Really enjoy this character & the story lines.  Give them a try...
B00DTMCSO2|4.0|I don't quite understand the negative reviews. I tested on Kindle Fire HD and had no problem running and controlling it. It's actually easier to fly than for example F18 carrier landing.<br />You have two views (pan to look around), including functioning cockpit, controls are steering with tilt and sliders for throttle, flaps and rudder (turn without banking).<br />In the free version you have only one plane but can choose from a few missions including a landing on a carrier. The landscape looks pretty nice, the sound is a bit weak. You can also choose the time of day. Yes, it has night flight.<br />You shouldn't expect to see every blade of grass on mobile, all flight simulators I've tested only show some structures in detail, otherwise it's patterns that look plausible from above to save memory and CPU power.<br /><br />Just one tip: be patient when taking off and wait until you gain at least 45 knots or so. If you pull up near stall speed, it's hard to gain either more speed or altitude, even at full throttle - this is an underpowered fossil, not a stunt plane.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I was dying for an awesome vintage looking book case for my new Mini and I found one for 150 bucks.... I was at Walmart today and saw this one and was so excited but then saw it wasn't for a mini and got bummed. Well I ended up turning my cart around and going double check. Im so glad I did. I absolutely LOVE IT and my mini fits LOL  it is pushing it with the elastic but im super crafty if it ever comes undone. I even added a magnet and now its even that much more perfect. Well built I can tell and just so awesome. I am truly happy with this product. Yay!!!!!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Wonderful story of this man's experience in to the next world.  I am always amazed by people who scoff at someone else's experiences.  Here we have medical personnel who had a hard time believing one of their own.  I am a firm believer in near death experience.
0439023513|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this series of books.<br />I have lent the books out to three people already.<br />Great read
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|The only experience I had with Judge Dredd was the Sega Game and the Stallone movie. This is not either of those things. An amazing story and awesome actors really make all the difference. An explosive and very violent joyride through a troubled future that's worth watching over and over.
B00C5R8364|5.0|A fast paced thriller in tune with th headlines regarding terrorism and the Middle East in general. Accurate descriptions of the countries involved and the weapons used.
B003K07DUC|5.0|Really enjoyed this accurate portrayal of the beginning of the Iraq war with all the lies of the Bush regime exposed. Hard truth is better than soft lies and hopefully people will pay attention to the warmongers
B00C2IPB66|5.0|Excellent Blue Ray Disk. Fast shipment.
B00BQ1DBUS|4.0|Time that he got back to song writing.<br /><br />My favorite track by far is BRIGHTON BEACH- \\"So we fell in love, & I toured your heart with my out of tune guitar.\\" I think this is absolutely one of the most hauntingly beautiful songs of love lost that he has ever written. It is reminiscent of Maggie Mae, Every Picture Tells a Story & I Was Only Joking in it's story-telling ability to paint a picture with lyrics & has the bitter-sweetness and depth of Mandolin Wind.<br /><br />I like most of the songs with Sexual Religion being the only exception. Can't Stop Me Now & It's Over are tied for second favs. Having been through a divorce with children I can totally relate. The up tempo songs (Finest Woman, Beautiful Morning, Make Love to Me Tonight) have me dancing around the house while I clean. He slows things down for Live the Life, Time & Pure Love. Rod can NEVER go wrong with a Tom Waits song as is evidenced by Picture in a Frame.<br /><br />I have literally all but maybe 2 studio albums and this is quickly moving to the top of my most played CDs.
B000VWYNNW|2.0|Today I heard 'Over The Hills & Far Away' from this CD and I have to say: a high school rock band COULD NOT do a worse performance! Actually, the only bad part of the song was Plants singing! He screws up the lyrics patheticly & sings out of tune at the same time! ADVICE: Buy 'How The West Was Won' instead of this load!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|In Jetpack Joyride you are the character Barry. Barry steals a prototype mechanical gun jetpack. As you go through the halls you dodge lasers and freak out scientists. Fun game for kids.
B0066WJLU6|4.0|Comes in very handy when extra light is needed.  It is easy to understand and use. A great option for no cost.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I order it now a month ago and I still have not been able to get it to work.<br />Looks like I have to order another one. I may have just got a lemon.<br /><br />Bought a new one and it works!
B0070YDOT8|5.0|It is more challenging to build my chips from small to bigger.  One problem - sometimes I succeed and a lot of times I go broke.  Hubby is not a gambler so I am very cautious of the money I spend to buy chips or I hear about it.  I cannot help but love playing Big Fish.
1449433251|5.0|This collection is awesome. I read these as a kid and now have passed them on to my 10-year old cousin. He loves it. And although some of the themes will be too deep for him to grasp, the beauty of Calvin and Hobbes is that when you read them again, after some experience is gained, knowledge obtained, and perspective broadened, you get that much more out of it.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Good game so far... just started but graphics seem really good...in store purchases seem pretty pricey but most games are these days
B007UK83S4|3.0|Been a fan of the Who since their start up.  Things started declining when Keth Moon died and then when John Entwhistle passed away the magic died too.  There's no debate that Pete Townshend was the real kingpin of the Who and his songwriting was probably undervalued. He wrote some great music.  This book was only mildly interesting.  He acknowledges his near psychosis though not in those words.  It's a brutally honest book but not all that compelling to read. I love biographies of rock stars but this one I found I could put down for a week or more and then go back to it for a few pages. It's a great pity that there weren't any photos to enrich the material.  I found myself Googling lots of the names of people in the book to find out what they looked like.  The book's ok but not as fascinating as, say, Keith Richard's or Bob Dylans biographies.
0393325172|4.0|A rollicking sea story<br /><br />`Master and Commander' was for me a very good read.  I didn't see the movie but it brought Patrick O'Brian's tales of Aubrey and Maturin to my attention given my interest in the history of exploration, and my love of the sea and sailing. The strength of the main characters, in particular Maturin, the exacting descriptions of the places, flora and fauna, and the rollicking adventures and sea stories caught me up in the excitement, danger and humour to the last page.  I am now half-way through `Post Captain'!
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|Absolutely blew me away. The CD was in perfect condition, no damage to packaging or whatever, and her music is just amazing. It's getting more than good use in my car, on my ipod, on my phone...haha!
0316228583|4.0|It's all in the detail<br />The detail and intrigue, and the entangled connections of the characters make `The Casual Vacancy' one of my top reads this year. Sometimes I had to go back and reread sections to make sure I was on the right track - and I usually wasn't! Having not read Rowling's Potter series (I did see the movies), I started this book with no preconceptions. For me, the idea of Barry's death causing such polarisation in the community, and the way in which Rowling drip feeds the details of the personal secrets and lives of the characters makes this story fascinating, and it becomes increasingly so as the `facts' are revealed. I enjoyed the detail - like Elizabeth George and PD James - immaculate detail.
B00EL8JCGU|3.0|Definitely not the BEST zombie picture ever made and doesn't come close to something like the TV Show \\"Walking Dead\\", but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it.  The action was fast moving from the very start and the special effects were really well done.<br /><br />I am an avid zombie movie fan so it is easier for me to tell you it is something worth watching, I would say RENT it now, since the price is not for purchasing at $14.99, which is NOT worth it, but it is worth RENTING, for $4.95 to check it out for the fun of it.<br /><br />Brad Pitt does what Brad Pitt does best, plays the \\"hero of the hour\\" kinda guy and helps put the world on a potential good track again, but they did leave it open for a possible sequel and the overall problem was not really solved to destroy the zombies. At any rate, worth watching and NOT a time waster, but definitely not a Blue Ray DVD Uncut super set edition, $29.00+ with trailers and such, definitely a waste of money there.<br /><br />I think what lacked the most was I found myself not caring at all that much about the main characters of the movie. Nothing is spent on creating these characters and fleshing them out, so to speak. If they had spent more time on that, and perhaps made it a bit less predictable in the storyline (I never read the book), perhaps it may have been much, much better.<br /><br />Thanks again for reading my review, happy zombie hunting!<br /><br />Mike
0375842209|5.0|I ordered this book for a college course of mine and it arrived in very good condition.  My only complaint is that the book it's self wasn't sealed at all but I guess that's not too bad since it never got damaged to begin with.
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|As far as I new Agnetha's songs this is maybe the best her album from ABBA' s time... This is from my point of view only.
B00DGMVJAO|2.0|Jack the Giant Slayer had some nice special effects, but overall was pretty stupid. Something to do when I'm so tired I can't think and just want to stare at the screen.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book starts out seemingly a standard (although a well written one) mystery.  The plot turns out to be much more intricate and the theme is a deconstruction of marriage and who we are verses the faces we show the world.  Very interesting on both levels.
B00DU74U74|1.0|After reading the book and then dragging through this movie, I was amazed at the lack of perception by whomever cast it. One of the main charactors, Melanie, was tall, physically strong and also mentally strong.  Saoirse Ronan wasn't big enough, physically strong enough to carry it off. Plus Melanie and the alien were two different people and should have had two separate voices.  This movie just didn't work for me.
B00EABIZ2K|5.0|Like others, I was definitely concerned when I heard Steven Wilson was not going to be involved in this Blackfield album. However, Steven's departure has opened new doors for Aviv. The new Blackfield album is concise and effective, and features a number of guests vocalist (including Steven himself) who make the record one of the most diverse and varied. Ultimately, the album is more uplifting and vindicating than what you'd expect Steven Wilson to put his name behind. Highlights are \\"X-Ray\\" featuring the voice of Anathema, and \\"Faking\\". It's a 5 star record and I am thrilled to hear where Aviv takes the project next.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|used the device to cast several instances of streaming media (NETFLIX and HBOGO) from my IPad to a TV and the results was extremely poor. The picture was very choppy, pixilated and froze up a lot.Not happy with the performance of this device. I may try again to cast from a laptop to a TV but this is not how I originally planned to use this device.<br /><br />Update review:<br />Tried casting from a laptop and it works very well for Netflix and YouTube but does not work well casting browser tabs. I guess Google is still developing usage for this device. Excellent performance for limited applications.
B00457WZEI|5.0|I read this, and then saw the movie.  The book far exceeds the tale told on film.  Written from the horse's perspective it is a very interesting read.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|OKAY so I just ran into this game and started playing ,right, so then I realized I could not stop!!<br /><br />  So this game is #AMAZTASTIC<br />  #love it<br />  #bye!!<br />  #love infinity!!<br />  ~~~ by infinity<br />  *&euro;&yen;*
B00003CXTG|5.0|This movie was so much like the real thing.  Lots of startling features.  I believe it shows more of what really happened at Pearl Harbor.  Things the public really didn't get to see at the time.  Some very shocking.  A great job by all. A good History Lesson.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I loved this game it's addicting I'm always playing it while I'm watching tv reading or eating I just can't seem to pull away from Jurassic park builder the only time I stop playing is when I can no longer keep my eyes open its so much fun
B000068TPN|5.0|What an Awesome Movie!  No dry eyes here.  Mel played a great part, along with Sam Elliott, another of my favorites. This really happened, you just have to see it to believe it.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|there isn't even a candy crush the real game on a kindle fire its so stupid now I have to play on my moms phone the kindle fire should have all the games that are on iphones so stupid don't get.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|I love how the author creates such a clear picture of each story the reader.  From the beginning of Americanah, the story of Ifem and Ceiling, their families and friends, weaved a path of longing, hope and love.  From Nigeria to America and back, the author has an amazing gift of taking you on her story's journey completely.
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|This game is so much fun.  The Star wars franchise is full steam ahead and the story.  OH MY GODNESS THE STORY REALLY ADDS TO IT.  Good job.
B00EFNXPFK|5.0|Its different then his other albums but that's what you get with John Mayer. Its never the same and I am always excited to hear the changes.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Fantastic fun and completely enjoyable. At the moment can't put it down. Great game and fun for all the family.
B001EN71DQ|5.0|Oiga~! This is Star Wars....it needs a review not, methinks. :-)  A VERY serious black belt en KickBoxing once told me about an old Chino that basically did a Yoda move on him.  IT IS REAL.~~that which George Lucas portrays as \\"JediPower\\" IS ABSOLUTELY REAL~!!!
B00EI6E17A|5.0|Upbeat!  Makes me want to get up and dance!  Gaga music gets me motivated at the gym.  Can't wait to hear the whole album
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love watching YouTube on my ig screen tv using chromecast. It was easy to install and easy to use. The price is so worth it!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My wife and I really enjoy Downton Abbey. We recommend it to those who like good developed character focused drama.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Love it. Was very interesting seeing the inside life of prison. Wasn't as scarey as I expected it to be
B009RX7WTI|5.0|I just don't have Time to watch during prime time hours, and I don't have TiVo.<br />With Amazons lowest price guarantee when you pre-order, this works out perfectly.
B0045EJY90|2.0|The product is describe as is but it doesn't have an Input. An Aux Input added to this recorder will make it a plus.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I downloaded this book because during this time period my grand mother was an orphan, thankfully no matter how awful the orphanage in NY was she never was put on an orphan train.<br />These poor little kids with no parents shipped from orphanages to the midwest supposedly to be taken in and become part of a family<br />I'm sure some may have lucked out and this did happen but for the most part these kids were free labor to farmers and their wives.<br />I can only hope the people who came up with this idea had good intentions for these kids but then what's the old saying...the road to hell is paved with good intentions....
076115678X|5.0|Every mother with a girly curl needs this book to start her girl on the right path of loving her curls. Many years of useless suffering could have been avoided for me if I'd been taught that my hair was not a curse. I've lived my life according to the weather forecast, and since I've started using the advice here, with a good cut, and no-silicone, no-sulfate products, I am free!! No more waiting for a low humidity day to enjoy my life! Others compliment my hair all the time. Love it!
B008DVJO8C|5.0|Blood has a more refined feel than some of In This Moment's earlier albums.  Though, the earlier albums were great, this is the next evolution in In This Moment's journey in becoming a bad ass band.  They're already there in my book!<br /><br />My wife loved In This Moment, fell in love with the song &#34;Blood&#34;, went crazy when she heard &#34;Whore&#34;, and &#34;Adrenalize&#34; solidified me buying the album for her.  Each song she heard was her favorite, until she heard the next song.  One of the rare people I know who can listen to an album five times in a row and would listen to it five times more.<br /><br />Great album, and In This Moment will only get better!
B007C7UZIG|5.0|I love having the steam card. It makes it easy to use.<br />Thank you, love it nothing else to say
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Not as good as the book but then, what movie is?  Great movie for younger audience and performance were great.
B000NM46PA|4.0|Plays just fine, what more can i say. It is 2112 the record. Awesome and Amazing in all its Glory!
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Loved it would like to see another made soon.  It was a lot better than the stalone version.  Wish I would have seen it in 3D.
6305428271|5.0|Another teacher makes a difference in the lives of disadvantaged kids... Michelle Pfeiffer plays this role well.  She uses unconventional methods to connect with her students.  Her life changes along with her students.  Took me a long time to find this movie... One of my favorites!
B0098QBEXO|5.0|I had no idea what to expect when I clicked on Third Star. Turns out it was exactly what I needed...a thoughtful,touching story beautifully filmed. I had a good cry. And the soundtrack is lovely too!
B004X80QNG|4.0|Tremendous organizer. Schedules tasks including recurring ones, appointments and tasks appear together in your calendar or daily view, nice widget to give you the important stuff on your home screen, almost limitless ways to customize what data you want to see, how you want it presented, and what you want it to look like, synchronizes with Google for tasks, appointments, and contacts. I have used various apps that have done individual tasks (calender, to-do, contacts) but haven't tried a better integrated package. All that being said, the only thing that kept me from rating five stars is that it's a bit pricey. It might reach a wider audience with a lower price.
B005HSL626|5.0|Enjoy the Fuit Ninja game I can't get enough of it. Go Fruit Ninja !!! Highly recommendend for any age.
B00DWZHTRW|4.0|\\"Now You See Me\\" is a caper thriller genre film based on a coalition of magicians/tricksters who are mysteriously brought together, and establish themselves as a performing group called \\"The Four Horsemen\\".<br /><br />The narrative for the most part presents an escapade between \\"The Four Horsemen\\" and the FBI, but there are many subtleties and the group's name (The Four Horsemen) comes from the New Testament of the Bible, specifically, the Book of Revelation. Therefore, this name suggests the need to rid evil with a divine apocalypse. Subsequently, the key issues of the film are stealthily attached behind what seems like a game to evade both a sceptic of the group's magic and the authorities.<br /><br />The movie presents a variety of characters with unique personalities and there are several gripping scenes which keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|This book was a lot of fun but basically a well-done summer read. There wasn't as much to think about later as some other books I have recently read.
B002R88G5E|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It was the second one I've read by Khaled Hosseini and I've found both books to be very easy to read. They give a good picture of life on Afghanistan before the present day. The characters are interesting  and your attention is held throughout the whole story.
B00ECUARO8|1.0|Not a very good movie. I wouldnt recommend it. It has an interesting story line, but the characters were not built up very well and the acting was pretty flat.
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|Amazing song writing! One hit after another! A must have for any music collector or fan of fun country music!<br />BUY!!!!
B00F35B8F8|5.0|I might not be the best judge of the new Star Trek movies because it was the JJ Arbams movies that got me into watching the original Star Trek series. Which I love. As a non-Trekkie when I started, I enjoyed the movie very much.
B00EL8JCGU|2.0|There is virtually no plot in this kinetic exercise, which finds Brad Pitt running from zombies world-wide as he investigates the outbreak of what appears to be a virus that causes people to become the undead. A former lead investigator for the U.N. (there's a confidence builder), Pitt is blackmailed into his globetrotting sleuthing by the U.S. Navy, which more or less tells him his family will be turned over to the zombies if he does not cooperate. Who or what Pitt actually is is never really made clear (he is not a doctor, so why is he the man for the job?), which makes the actions of everyone else in the movie so puzzling. People who've just met him sacrifice their lives to save him or give up their seats on aircraft, because he is from the U.N., just like the real world (not). Somehow everyone instantly knows that this is the-one-man-who-can-save-us, yet his own actions undercut this vision. I mean, if you are escaping riots and civil unrest in Philadelphia, would a sane person make their destination Newark, NJ? Physics don't seem to matter. A giant cargo plane is instantly refueled from a single fuel truck and able to fly from Korea to Israel, despite having landed \\"on fumes\\". A battered airliner leaves Israel in a hurry and manages to make it to Wales before anyone realizes there are zombies on board. Pitt and his Israeli companion both instantly recover from massive wounds that would fell a rhinoceros, and are the sole survivors of a catastrophic plane crash.<br /><br />The zombie attacks are pretty routine, except for the long shots, but these are so cartoonish as to be laughable. The film is one long chase scene until the end, when everything slows down and it sort of just stutters to a halt. The outbreak? Never solved. The war? Nope, left the door wide open for a possible sequel. From the opening credits, it appears the original cut of this movie had a political message about global warming, but they cut it out, leaving virtually nothing else but running and shooting.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Great effects! Nice twist with a classic Tom Cruise Scientology ending...good guy movie. Most chicks won't except the ending as romantic, guys will get it! ;)
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|This sci-fi thriller unfolds like a novel, with a deliberate pace, each revelation building upon the other. Jack Harper is part of a two person team left behind on a desolated Earth after a war against an alien race. Mankind has relocated to Titan. Jack and his partner's job is to maintain the drones that protect the power generators sucking energy from Earth's oceans to power life on faraway Titan. Neither Jack nor his partner have a memory more than five years old, but Jack is haunted by dreams of a previous life, dreams that focus on a beautiful woman and visions of Earth before the war. Soon we begin to see that all is not as it seems.<br /><br />Despite the measured pace, the stunning visuals hold your interest: visually this film is a triumph. There are enough big action scenes to keep it exciting, although the movie begins to look familiar in parts, paying homage to Star Wars, Independence Day, The Matrix, and any post-apocalyptic thriller you've ever seen (I'm talking about you, Mad Max).<br /><br />This movie requires you to think and remember in order to understand the final revelations, so if you aren't the sort of person who likes puzzle movies, you might want to avoid this one.
B00EEL0LGY|4.0|I loved the first riptide and was extremely excited when gp2 came out. The gameplay is amazing. clear and simple. I was I bit dissapointed that there was no freeplay.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I am truly enjoying Enigmatis.  The graphics and story line are superb.  I expect that the story will become more intense as the story unfolds.  Would definetly recommend.
B00138J342|5.0|A very good album if you're a fan of Pearl Jam. If you liked Ten, it's definitely worth picking up.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|Having never played the video games nor read any of the previous books I found this book to be an incredible fun story.
B000ZMCVRI|5.0|This album is pretty much the epitome of Bob Marley.  If you're only wanting a few of the catchy, popular songs, then this is the album for you.  It contains all the classics you hear sampled in movies and commercials.  If you're not sure if you like Bob Marley, this is the place to start.  Definitely should be anybody's first Bob Marley album.  Totally recommend this for anybody.
B00BN4JQ6G|5.0|It has all the songs that I love listening to and the bonus dvd was great. Very smart investment for music lovers.
B0011U5DY6|5.0|If you were a new fan of Bob Marley and were going in order of albums to buy, I would start first with Legend, and then move to this album.  Fantastic music with an inspirational message, this album provides it.  Awesomely chill, you can't go wrong with this album.
014241493X|4.0|Paper Towns is the story of Quentin Jacobsen and Margo Roth Spiegelman. Quentin and Margo have been friends since they were two and lived next door to each other. One night, just weeks before their graduation, Margo enlists Quentin to go on a night full of pranks and tricks. It is one thrilling night for Quentin, despite his many anxiety attacks during the pranks. The next day the enigmatic Margo is gone, without a trace. Quentin embarks on a road trip to end all road trips as he tries to find Margo.<br /><br />Before I started Paper Towns, I had great expectations for it - for the sole reason that I absolutely adored The Fault in Our Stars (another book by John Green). TFIOS ripped inside and out in this beautiful story about teens with cancer. I wasn't sure if Paper Towns could live up to that, but I thought I would give another John Green novel a go.<br /><br />I'm pleased to say while Paper Towns wasn't as fantastic, wonderful, rainbow-filled sunshine as TFIOS it was still pretty awesome. It is like the best mystery and road trip story ever.<br /><br />The character of \\"Q\\" Quentin is realistic as a nerdy boy that thinks he loves his next door neighbour. Naturally when Margo goes missing he has to find her. Margo was truly an enigma. During the story I found times that I could relate to her and other times where I felt like she acted like a spoilt brat - expecting people to find her.<br /><br />My most favourite character was Radar, the boy whose parents have the biggest Black Santa collection ever, and whose life goal is updating Omnictionary (a kind of Wikipedia). He was so true to himself and his advice to Q - stop expecting people to be who you want them to be and see them for what they are - and this was really refreshing in a YA book.<br /><br />Paper Towns was a really enjoyable summer read. It features a super epic road trip and I liked it a lot.
B000V6OMU2|5.0|If you like Bob Marley, then you'll love this album.  Powerful messages combined with great music simply makes it an awesome album to relax to.  One love!
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Great music to listen to and a very unique blend of classical talent and techno beat.  This girl has some talent.
B003AVPV1O|3.0|It allows me to watch or use tv as a monitor, but the resolution 1280 720 takes over the computer monitor.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Not much to say.....this game is as good as any other mahjong game..Nice graphics though...... Would rate it 4 out o 5.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Good game aiming could be better, graphics are good, I think if they could make the aim more of a point then a pull system it would make the game better
B00DYVESVO|5.0|Great story!  I love the Hulk and this is him at his destructive, angry best.  I love that Hulk takes the best shot of each hero and keeps coming.  Hulk smash!
B009KS4XRO|1.0|The game seems to be predisposed against tablet users. I read the conversations while playing. We seem to get fewer wins. The tournament games yield few wins. Can.t get coins.  The  power ups do not yield a good percentage of instant wins. We don't even have it easy on slots. Getting we I am more frustrated than<br />pleasures when playing.<br /> The game needs some work.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|It lays out the tapestry a life is and how it's threads never break, through hardship, sorrow, betrayal, but prevail in ways only a lifetime can reveal.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|Nice app, so easy to use! Efficient and  effective at cleaning up my mess. Glad it is part of the family
B005SAP45I|2.0|About halfway through the movie I just got bored with it. I loved the first one but this one just fell flat for me.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I absolutely love it! I came into the series on season two and am now just getting to  season one, what a treat. It's only been a week and I am almost through it. I'm already starting to mourn.
B008M0NDOK|1.0|The best thing about this is the stand. The only way you are gonna get any use out of the controller itself is if you use a jail broken device, otherwise it's a paperweight.
B0002VFXFE|4.0|I bought this product because it is supposed to be the best. I have used it to fix my overheating PS3 several times and am not sure on the results. On one hand, the PS3 has continued to overheat even after using this thermal compound and after I have upgraded the fan. On the other hand, I am an amateur when it comes to electronics repair and I could be doing things wrong or putting a band-aid on a bigger wound. I am giving it the benefit of the doubt, but not convinced.
B000E1YW0E|5.0|This film is truly one of the most amazing broadway musicals ever! We are excited to own it and the condtion it came in was perfect! We watch it all the time!
0425263924|5.0|Amazing and captivating. Great writing and can't wait to see where this story takes us! Sylvia is an amazing writer!
B00006J3WH|5.0|It was fantastic to receive this in time for our trip. My little girl loves this! We listen to it all the time, in our truck!
B004CS7R70|3.0|We purchased this for an individual suffering with the onset of macular degeneration and mild age-related dementia.  She finds that it does help her somewhat watching TV.  It also inproves her vision when she goes outdoors.  However, she has trouble focusing the lenses.  When I tried the glasses I found them to offer a small degree of magnification for distance vision and I had no trouble with the focusing if I closed one eye while focusing the glasses for the other eye.  I believe they are over-priced, but they are, at least, functional.
B00D2CYU2W|5.0|Matt Damon was wonderful in this movie, & Micheal Douglas was OK.  I would recommend this movie to anyone.  I am very glad I bought it.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|It was funny. The kids watched it over and over again.  They played with their McDonald toys as they watch the movie.
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|This is a good game if you want something that you need to think and work through.  No mindless matches here
0061906220|5.0|She is a preschooler, and they read this book one day. All she did when she would come home was repeat the book, word for word to me and anyone who would listen. when i order this along with a bunch of other Pete The Cat books, she was so excited!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Cool concept for a game. Each room is a little bit different but the basis for finding clues and solving puzzles is the same.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|This movie is great because it captured the feel of the comics, mixing the gritty surroundings with over the top violence, without going into the realm of being gory. The Slo-Mo effects are beautiful cinematography, and are used to great effect, both visually and throughout the story.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|Dumb ways to die is the best game ever you save these guys from weird things and you can get the video which is really cool. if you want a good laugh get this game.
0802136834|5.0|Book was &#34;used&#34; but in no way looked it!!  VERY happy with the purchase.  I LOVE this book and use it when researching the Tudors further.  Can't get enough of it. Also, great seller, great condition, SUPER fast shipping.  Deserves 10 stars!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|DRAWS YOU IN AND KEEPS YOU ENCHANTED, GREAT ACTING, SCRIPTS AWESOME, COSTUMES GORGEOUS, AS WELL AS THE LOCATION, LOVE IT!
B002VPE1AW|5.0|This film is a classic.  It has special meaning to me; I saw it with the love of my life.<br />Excellent multi-level film.
B00742GBDM|5.0|I just love Jane Austen and this is the best interpretation of this novel. Frances O'Connor is lovely in this film.
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|Horrible. The best thing about the movie was Tom' s swimming pool. That's why I gave it only one star.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|Doesn't let me type in numbering format like the computer. Waste of $15.00 . The preview shows that you can do that.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Love this series!  We purchased the first season and couldn't pull ourselves away from it.  Same with this season...love it!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|great execution, product arrived on time as promised, set up was easy...sort of had some issues but solved it without to little frustration. the only compliant I have is content, Netflix and youtube, come on guys...2??  really, its 2013, 1999.......otherwise 5 stars. highly recommended product.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|A little confusing at first but it definitely keeps you on your toes! Will recommend to friends, especially since it was $3!
B0091REZMW|4.0|Fun game. But uses up energy to fast. Hard to earn diamonds. But I love finding hidden objects. Also you get to kill what looks like gremlins that are roaming the manor as well.
B00447L4JG|5.0|My grandson watches the movie everyday and when he is not at home he constantly asks to take it with him wherever he goes.
B00AEBB9T6|5.0|This is a fine, enjoyable adventure movie fit for all ages, despite being panned when it came out in the mid 1990's. No, it doesn't live up to the hyper action of today's action flicks. This is deliberately retro, recalling the pulpy comics of the 1930s. The first-rate cast doesn't hurt either.
B00EMJBVAI|5.0|Just what we needed, a fun and heart pounding weekend evening at home.<br />Turn up the sub woofer and enjoy.
B002W7J3SO|5.0|Just about as good as it gets. Ol' Cockers at his best!  Funny, innovative and intriguing.  You should watch this instead of lookin for work! It's that good!
B000UVT3OI|5.0|I received Exactly what I was expecting. I would Highly recommend  to every one who is looking for something like this
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Will not fit into the HDMI in back of T.V.I would have loved to have used it also if you do not have a internet connection it will not work i bought this because we live in the woods and thought i could put movies on the computer at work then bring home for the family
B00ECP764C|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie Oblivion, so it was nice to be able to find a steelbook version.  The blu-ray and DVD copies are just fine.  As expected.  Unfortunately, despite the words shown in the items title, my case showed up with no digital or UV codes.  This is pretty disappointing, but there's not a whole that I can do to fix it (realistically).
B009IH0ICG|5.0|my husband loves this. he can start his carcoal to cook his ribs in 2 minutes. but he does have to make sure not to set it on the gas grill side while sarting it the as the paper burns it goes into the gas grill and then he has to clean it.  lol
B00EFNXPFK|5.0|I've always realized John Mayer is a serious talent yet I just didn't connect with his airy somewhat affected (to me) voice. This new album reaches a whole new level for a matured talent. (maybe it's because I'm 57 and he's not).<br />I love this album, it's been a while since I look for the time to sit down and listen intently to a new recording.
B00DMEQP46|5.0|I love you too, death is cute like the valentine a girl receives from the shy boy in 2nd grade. He can't openly admit his feelings for.her because what would all his school boy friends think and plus would he want to alien ate all the plenty of girls in the class room? Sea no he would not so he writes a love letter knowing it will trick her because why would she read something called I love you, too, death when she has gone all over television promoting eternal youth and immortality but she is forced to open the Valentine and read it just once quickly \\"to be polite\\" she tells herself and then discovers immediately that he really means I LOVE YOU TO DEATH and you know what, she accepts the morbid valentine and hopes they live forever anyway. Never ask Andrew VanWyngarden who is Veronica Grey. His shoulder won't allow him to surf or play guitar

B00CUWWLWG|4.0|I wish there's more workers limit other than two, that the shields aren't as expenssive and it's easy to earn auras. love how it's fastnto create units and collect ingredients.
B009YQJ322|5.0|Unfortunately, this movie did very poorly at the box office both in the states and the rest of the world but don't let that fool you, this movie is worth watching. By no means is it the best movie ever made but it's a bloody good time (no pun intended). It's good to see a comic book adaptation not only be very faithful to the source material but maintain a adult rating as well (I guess the two go hand in hand). The story is fairly straightforward but it's well written enough to keep you intrigued until the end. Karl Urban is fantastic as Dredd and the supporting cast is great, with the standout being Lena Heady as the antagonist \\"Mama\\".<br /><br />I'm not particularly well versed in the Judge Dredd lore but I throughly enjoyed this movie. It's got spectacularly gruesome action, great acting and a well written story. If you're looking for a great action movie that provides a little more substance than most then check this out.

B00D2PIUAM|5.0|I've been a devoted fan of Placebo for 14 years now and they never disappoint.  Having the privilege of following their evolving sound with each release, I have to say there is a process to it.  It's almost as if there is a learning curve to each album they release.  They challenge themselves to keep their material fresh and innovate in all areas of sound.  This in turn produces a product that we must consume and digest that isn't like what we are used to.  Having said that, Loud Like Love has everything you have grown to love about Placebo and will not disappoint with lyrics filled with imagery and subtle meanings, or rhythmic melodies that are addictive and force you to return and listen again.<br /><br />Favorite track: A Million Little Pieces
B00000K413|5.0|I owned the vinyl back in the day and this just brought me back to the 1980's.  3 more words.

B0055OMBIU|3.0|First saw this in stores, very expensive, glad I got it for less on Amazon.  Paris not as interesting as London, but much better than New York.  Only a one time thing, then pass off to a friend.  Probably won't try any others.
B008602KQI|3.0|I like plot and charters but movie was too slow moving.  They could done alot to enhance the drama of the plot.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Full of action and drama as the groups (MC Clubs) use a variety of stratagies and manipulation to advance their goals.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Simply Riveting;  I just could not stop watching it.  The story line and the characters were excellent.  The writers let us get to know Rick a little more.
B003TXSF5C|5.0|Clear, understandable explanations of M-theory, Anthropic Principle. Builds concept upon concept until the entire structure is obvious. Recommended for high-school students to adults.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It is made up of several different mysteries involving Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. I enjoyed e Rey one of the stories because I love mysteries.
B0085KGHI6|5.0|Really am enjoying this album.  If you like the blues, this album is for you. Really brings back memories. Great purchase.
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|Not as good as I thought it would be. And you must buy all kinds of things to get past some of the screens.

B008B11RLQ|5.0|Along with &#34;Original Album Classics&#34; this collection of other Elvis albums allows fans to obtain duplicates of original vinyl albums in the more convenient and portable format of CDs.  The albums are not duplicated in the sets, thus making it more practical and less expensive to add these more durable albums to fans' collections.  Whoever is responsible for the collections has made a solid contribution to the continuation of the legend of the King of Rock and Roll.  Bravo! and Thank You!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Just as riveting as season 1.  Thought I would find &#34;English Masterpiece Theater&#34; boring.  Not so.  Finished in 1 week and on to season 3.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Fun easy to play good value for the price, wish you had more ammunition for free. Good tutorials. Cute donors.
B005LAII80|5.0|On point adaption of the comic hero. Excellently paced film with stunning visual effects and incredible action. Perfect casting. Karl Urban is to Dredd what Robert Downey Jr. is to Tony Stark. Highly recommended.
B001KWZ796|5.0|I rated this movie five star, because it's a movie you like watch again and again and it seems true to life and it is clean, any age can watch it.  Thanks
B008Y7IP0S|5.0|Cobra Kai, sweep the leg, I'll tell you when he's had enough! wax on, wax off. This movie is the best of all time! In all actuality it's pretty terrible but Joe Esposito would disagree saying the karate kid is &#34;the best around&#34; if you were born in the 80s there's a good chance you'll love this movie, if not Ralph macchio will show up at you door step to crane kick you in the face and set you straight!
B003YFIUW8|1.0|This book rubbed me the wrong way from page one. I hated the stilted childish talk and the self centered mother who forces her child to save them then abandons him by trying to commit suicide.
0061900656|5.0|We purchased this for our 2 year old who will be a big brother in a few months.  This is gender neutral (baby is just referred to as baby) and the perfect length for a 2 year old's attention span.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This is an enchanting fairy tale for adults. This is on my short list of books to gift at Christmas.

B0055V6EZE|4.0|Not the best blues album, but its absolutely charming. The piano playing is fantastic. Definitely a good addition to your collection.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|I had heard it called a live action version of WALL-E which isn't a 100% accurate. Tom Cruise has a way of leaving his mark on his films that drive an otherwise interesting bit of material into banal mediocrity and this movie is no different. It has some very nice cinematography with aerial photography of the dystopian future. Story-wise, it has a sort-of-interesting hook that is revealed near the end but it's way too little, too late. Watch it if you have NOTHING else to do.
B008QZ1ZYQ|5.0|This is a very fun game to play if you need to kill some time.  It 's a very addictive game.
0553801473|2.0|Absolutely the most disappointing book of the series. All the story lines are painfully drawn out and conclude with dissatisfying endings, especially Tyrion's and Bran's. There is even one chapter that is 99.5% identical to a chapter in book 4 - why?????<br /><br />I love (LOVE) the first 3 books of the series. The 4th deals mostly with supporting characters but also introduces a lot of new characters and subplots. Book four wasn't necessarily poorly written but poorly constructed and I know GRRM was trying something different. I look at book 4 like I look at Terminator 3. It looks bad by itself but A DANCE WITH DRAGONS is like Terminator Salvation; so bad it makes the previous book/movie look good in comparison.<br /><br />Sorry George, I guessed the fans forced you to rush this one out and I haven't given up on you.
B000ZN8036|1.0|Well, that is 2.5 hours of my life I'm not going to get back.<br /><br />One word: POINTLESS<br /><br />OK, to be honest, Hal Holbrook was great and the soundtrack was pretty good.
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|The film has some interesting sequences but overall, it doesn't leave you with much. Paper thin characters that you don't care about at all. No funny lines. No interesting plot devices. You would be much better off watching The Sting for the 20th time.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|It makes me feel like I have those real pets and I enjoy it . So I want to say thanks

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I never cry at books. Or movies. But I cried at this. John Green is amazing. Really, truly, he is.
B0064BWDRW|5.0|This is book 7 of a police series set in Norway, and featuring flawed detective Harry Hole. Love this series, i found this book a little different to the others in the series. I got very confused trying to figure out who was narrating, but it all became clear in a heart wrenching finale.<br /><br />*****Spoiler alert******Surely that's not the end of Harry? I feel gutted that we may not get to read about his exploits again. Very sad.
1936891026|4.0|If you are able and WILLING to admit that the act of creation through writing SUCCESSFULLY comes from a greater source that is only accessible from within, then The War of Art will help. If you are someone that would like to have written in order to become an author or are a dilettante; skip it--it's not going to resonate or be of any value to you. For those WRITERS out there struggling to grasp just what IT that may be holding you back, then The War of Art may help you better understand yourself.<br /><br />Some say that one key element in Truth is its universal nature. Well, the biggest thing The War of Art helped me understand is that what I'm experiencing is exactly what many other creatives experience and find hard to explain. Many times simply naming and defining something that is otherwise intangible is the biggest first step in defeating that which is holding us back. That's the biggest thing this book did for me; it gave my enemy a name and an intelligence report to go with it. Two huge factors that will help me fight my enemy better in the years to come.<br /><br />If you're a true creative and have yet to find any level of success or achievement that you HONESTLY feel you're capable of achieving (note: such as receiving good, solid feedback and critique on your work yet still struggle), then I highly recommend taking a look at The War of Art. If you're a writer that has struggled and grappled with an idea and the writing process and FEEL the sands of time slipping away, I would say that not reading The War of Art is throwing away an opportunity to turn things around or gain a little edge. It's certainly worth the day or two that it will take to read through it once and assess.<br /><br />Lastly, Id'd say that if you read The War of Art and have drawn a complete blank as to the merits of its contents...good luck with your writing endeavors, you're going to need it!
B0038AUY96|5.0|This is book 5 of a police series set in Norway, and featuring flawed detective Harry Hole. Love this series, Perseverance with the unusual names of characters and places will reward with original and engrossing story lines. It's truly heart-in-the-mouth stuff. Harry's still up there with Jack Reacher and Salvo Montalbano on my hunky heroes list. One warning though - the violence can be confronting.
B008602KQI|4.0|I will watch the other movies when they are released. I really like this movie. I didn't realize how good this movie is. I don't go for hype and when it came out I didn't want to see it. I viewed it from Amazon Prime instant movies and am very happy I did.
B000002AVF|5.0|This is one of my favorite Mariah Carey albums. I had all of her albums on cassette before CDs came out, and eventually replaced them all with CDs. This was one of the last ones I needed to complete my MC CD collection. It's even better than I remembered!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Amazing show. Don't miss out! Guy friendly as well. Great plot and acting. Violet is my favorite character by far.
1401322786|4.0|If you love the concept of time, the history, philosophy and science of time you must read this book. I also have a passion for watches,clocks and time measurement and loved this book. But if you want a heart warming story about mankind this is very much written with you in mind.

B006FO3ERQ|2.0|This book ad great potential, but it just did not make it off the runway.  It languished in long meaningless discussions about nothing, while not very much happened.  I was bored with this book.
B001RLP862|5.0|SUPER NICE FEEL.  NOT just hype.  These cards have not only a great feel, they are easy to handle also.  They shuffle easily and should last for a good while.  These were gotten for my 91 year old mother to play solitaire with.  Since these can be wiped off they were the perfect cards for her.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|WONDERful book!  My 12 year old grandson recommended it to me and - he wad right!  It was a great read; I couldn't put it down!
B0096CDG0O|1.0|What many people are writing is true. This was once a great game. The \\"upgrade\\" in August, 2013 completely ruined the fun. No notifications of when it is your turn, ads for \\"tournaments\\" I have no interest in, other unrelated ads, etc. I enjoyed playing for a few minutes a day, and had some good chats with other players. But once the change was made, it became a hassle even to figure out whose turn it was. Adding insult to injury, the \\"customer service\\" was just \\"form letter\\" emails. Never any real concern over responding or fixing the problems.<br />Hey, life goes on...it is just a silly game that I played for fun. But my personal opinion is that the developer of the game has tried to \\"upgrade\\" and make some more $$$. It is a free country. I am certainly not going to lose sleep over it, I simply uninstalled the game. I would advise anyone that is reading these reviews to look elsewhere for a Yahtzee-type game. Just one guy's opinion....
0515153656|5.0|I picked this up due to the movie which piqued my interest.  Very well written and super intense, this will keep your heart pounding all the way to the end.  Lots of plot twist and unexpected things popping up.  Now another series to be hooked on!
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|James, totally blown away!!! I'm ordering the book for my kids. All things are possible with the tools and examples you discuss in such a thorough and thoughtful  manner.<br />I've been reading self help books for years and have &#34;learned&#34; the concepts you discuss, but have never seen them all pulled together in such an engaging and practical way. As the saying goes, &#34;when the student is ready, the teacher will appear&#34;.<br /><br />Thank you for illuminating the path and the nudge down it.<br />Peace and blessings to you, always!<br /><br />Kind regards,<br />Pete
B00338QENI|5.0|Historical fact, still going on after 60 some odd years; highly interesting information on black/white relations, treatment, medical facts.  Sad at times story, but good results, pertinent always.  Henrietta continues to live through her cells.
0316228583|2.0|The story began with a man's death -- then many characters were introduced very soon thereafter.  The story line was the tortoise (to Harry Potter as the hare)  In the first hundred pages I had to go back and read half dozen sections to figure out who was who; basically I got lost with so many characters at once.(e.g. was Shirley related to Maureen or was Howard same person as Mr.Price?)<br />Then the story plodded on.  I put the book down many times, then forced myself to try to read again. You shouldn't have to force yourself to read a book if it well written.  This book was easy to put down, and down, and down. Then I got to the point that I didn't care what happened to this boring, self-centered lot of people.  She makes small villages seem as something dreadful.<br />I would not recommend this book.  I gave it two stars (instead of one star) because she did do well with the descriptive passages.<br />It was a novel in slow motion with confusing list of characteres and a truly boring story.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I enjoyed reading the Wool Omnibus quite a bit.  The different story lines were relatively easy to follow and there were enough twists and turns to make even the predictable parts of the story not as predictable as one might have thought. When I read a book I am hoping to be transported to that world and entertained and this saga did that for me and I can't wait to grab the 6th installment and dive in.  I will also be looking to read more from Hugh Howey!
0062103377|5.0|Bobby Singer is really quite unique with his journaling in his guide.  Didn't know where he was going with it the first few pages, but then caught on and really enjoyed it.

B0013WI0PQ|5.0|This movie was recommended by a friend. I thought this movie was very enjoyable. I have suggested it to several other people.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Police officers fighting drug trafficking, tragedy and their own personal weaknesses. They find strength in their faith to become better fathers. This is an amazing story, well done, with good humor and realism. I work with inmates with drug problems and showed it in the jail, and their request, and they loved it!! We talked about their pain in not having fathers present in their lives and as good role models. But we also talked about how they want to be better fathers for their own children in the future. They all walked out with specific plans to make changes in the way they will be involved in their children's lives, or in the lives of other young people. This is a movie that every man should see!
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|What can I say? The Beach Boys are AWESOME!!! I like different kinds of music,and The Beach Boys are at the top of the list!
B009V3KKXY|4.0|clear, easy to understand, excellent pictures and great instructions. Everything is broken down to the minutest steps. As I get better at these projects I'll get other books by this author.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I felt as if I could imagine the intricate paths of all the characters. Some readers have criticized the fact that there are too many characters and not all are developed. I thought that part of the point was exemplifiying the life path of a person misplaced by politics, ethnicity, etc. without actually going deeply into those issues.The issues were understood-and over written about-so I enjoyed the characters within the cultural and politicial background.
B005LAII80|5.0|The movie has great pacing, an excellent soundtrack, and awesome action scenes guaranteed to never bore you.<br />This is probably the best action movie I've seen since I saw Terminator 2 on VHS when I was a kid.
B008FPOIT6|2.0|The story started out intiruging-usually I like these type of books with a mystery of the ages-but this was like reading the adventures of scooby doo.<br />I cannnot believe it was on a the &#34;good reads&#34; list as a top read! Maybe by a 12 year old. Even though all Hunger Games was on the young adult read list I found these books &#34;ageless&#34;. Mr Penumbra on the other hand is definitely not an adult read in my mind. If I was 10-12-maybe.
1250030951|3.0|\\"In Rainbow Rowell's Fangirl, Cath is a Simon Snow fan. Okay, the whole world is a Simon Snow fan, but for Cath, being a fan is her life--and she's really good at it. She and her twin sister, Wren, ensconced themselves in the Simon Snow series when they were just kids; it's what got them through their mother leaving. Reading. Rereading. Hanging out in Simon Snow forums, writing Simon Snow fan fiction, dressing up like the characters for every movie premiere. Cath's sister has mostly grown away from fandom, but Cath can't let go. She doesn't want to. Now that they're going to college, Wren has told Cath she doesn't want to be roommates. Cath is on her own, completely outside of her comfort zone. She's got a surly roommate with a charming, always-around boyfriend, a fiction-writing professor who thinks fan fiction is the end of the civilized world, a handsome classmate who only wants to talk about words . . . And she can't stop worrying about her dad, who's loving and fragile and has never really been alone. For Cath, the question is: Can she do this? Can she make it without Wren holding her hand? Is she ready to start living her own life? And does she even want to move on if it means leaving Simon Snow behind?\\"<br /><br />I was not too fond of Eleanor and Park, but I'd heard good things about Fangirl, so I wanted to try Rainbow Rowell's writing again. Fangirl wasn't great, and there were a lot of elements I disliked about it, but I did really like the premise and ended up finding the book okay. I enjoyed the fact that in between chapters there's an excerpt from either a Simon Snow book or one of Cath's fanfictions. The fictional Simon Snow series is definitely modeled very much on Harry Potter, with eight books and a huge fandom, which includes Cath and Wren.<br /><br />What I didn't like about the book was the main character. There's antisocial, and then there's nuts. Cath really annoyed me; for the first month at the school she hides inside her room and doesn't goto the dining hall. Even if someone doesn't like talking to new people, even if they feel constricted, I find it really hard to believe that a person would subsist on protein bars for a month. It was crazy, absurd, and I couldn't understand how Cath could be so timid and not brave enough in a month to find the cafeteria. It was also really sad. That said, I could relate to her fears; she was just a bit too extreme to be believed, what with barely talking to her roommate for the first month, and not eating breakfast or dinner. Still, I did not like Cath at all at first, or even a whole lot as the book progressed. Of course, likable characters aren't the most important thing, but I like to have a protagonist who I can both relate to and like, somewhat. That's not to say they can't have problems; on the contrary. But Cath was so miserable and painfully shy the first month, and she didn't even try to do anything about it. It was also very odd that she was so scared of walking on the campus at night, scared enough that she would dial 911 and then run with her finger on the call button. Later, of course, all of this behavior is explained a bit, but I wish Rowell would have given us more clues early on. And what was revealed didn't make much sense.<br /><br />Wren was worse. It's clear that Cath is struggling with the changes of college, yet she still insists on not having her as a roommate or even living in the same dorm building. That part didn't make sense to me. There was also another solution to their problem: that they would go to different schools. Later, Wren drifts farther and farther away from Cath, and getting drunk and into trouble, and talking with their mother who left when they were little.<br /><br />I've made the book sound terrible. It isn't. There was a certain charm to it, and as I said, the story itself was pretty good, and I loved the Simon Snow/Harry Potter element. And just like Eleanor and Park, it got better as it went on, as Cath comes out of hershell, meets new people, and expands her writing abilities with Nick, another student in her fiction writing class. Was it better than Eleanor and Park? I don't think so. Eleanor and Park was a rather sweet romance with a good ending, and Fangirl really didn't live up to my expectations despite other's rave reviews. Still, it wasn't bad, and was entertaining enough. I'm not sure if I'll be reading more of Rainbow Rowell's novels in the future though. It will definitely have to be based on plot.<br /><br />My favorite sections of Fangirl were certainly the ones where Cath was writing, thinking about her writing, and going to her writing class. Those seemed to come to life, even if some of the other parts of the book didn't, and I ended up kind of enjoying Fangirl, though not enough to really redeem it. It was insightful at times, and while I didn't like the twins, I did enjoy the other characters: Reagan, Levi, and Nick, in particular. And the book got better the more I read. It just wasn't wildly entertaining or beautiful or gripping or anything. Thanks to St. Martin's for sending me a review copy.<br /><br />[...]

B00EMJD6TC|5.0|This is by far the best zombie movie, in my opinion. Why? It has a realistic approach. Other movies spent more time on effects and the stories were unrealistic. This is as real as zombies can get. The actors were great as well. No cheesy or humor crap. Gets to the action quickly. Just a big fan over all!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is t the best because this new make of it can make u jump and. all of other things it is much better then the last one
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|the game is awesome great graphics and also addictive I race my family they play then I play fun indescribabley fun
B007TK77QE|5.0|There is no Harry Potter about this book. Forget she wrote them. This was amazing, small town secrets, British humour, I loved it. Sometimes sad, sometimes dark and disturbing. All together great. I am looking forward to reading more.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|Easy to make a quick sketch and save it. Little kids would love it. It was free on the day I got it, not sure how much I'd be willing to spend on it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great city building game without too much need for real money. keeps me entertained. love the google game sync. runs well
B0058VW36U|5.0|Simple game. Sometimes timing is tricky so it can be a little challenging. Great game for kids too since it's easy to understand.
B00CTSDDVO|1.0|Thanks Paramount, I've learned never to pre-order your DVDs ever again.  You can get better extras in some of the cheaper versions of this film.  Get the Target Blu-Ray if you must buy it and want the best extras from one copy.  Otherwise just buy the cheapest version and forget the extras because most likely you aren't going to see them anyway.  To get all the extras for Star Trek Into Darkness you'd need to buy about a half dozen versions of this film from Target, Xbox, Best Buy, and others.  Why bother?  Go cheap and spend the money on TOS Blu-Ray set.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|You know this game already. You don't need my review. Heck, you already have it from the Google play store, I bet.
B001NN4162|5.0|Excellent clarity in the Blu-ray format!  I have seen this movie dozens of times now with my grandson and yet we still love to watch it again. The characters are wonderful and the story line great! Highly recommend.

B00005UWMX|2.0|Movie was good but can only play on computer and not in DVD player.  It was showing to play for dvds in europe
B005NKGEP2|4.0|I don't usually read spy thrillers, so maybe my standards are not the same as other readers, but I really enjoyed this book.  There is some affected usage of language (\\"half a decade\\" is used often instead of just 5 years, as an example) and the descriptions of the relentless bad weather get a bit much, but in general I was captivated by the story, and the setting. There is a lot of humor, vivid descriptions of Luxembourg, and a general window into the experience of being an American living in Western Europe.  It's fiction, and spy fiction at that, so obviously I don't expect characters to be \\"realistic\\". A great book to read on a long airplane ride.
1601251831|5.0|It was packaged well; I was never was a big fan of peanuts, though. It came within the time span expected, and I got a free Green Dragon carrying bag and an older comic I might save.

B00AQL8VU4|5.0|Unlike the last tablet I bought from Amazon from a Canadian importer that was only good for surfing the net,  but was not recognized by Amazon App Store and could not read e-pub books I have, this one is the best.<br />As good as the Nexus 7 and has a slot for my microSD card.

B002T9H2L0|4.0|Quentin Tarantino takes a story based partially on fact, and put's his signature stamp of quirky, somewhat stereotyped characters into motion as to yet another plot to kill the lunatic Hitler.  Christoph Waltz gives an Oscar worthy performance, and Brad Pitt takes his role of American &#34;Nazi Killer&#34; so over the top it's easy to believe there were soldiers during the war that would have fit right into his footsteps.  Tarantino much like the Coen brothers, tells his stories in romanticized hollywood fashion, but adds his particular 'it' factor to make them enjoyable for today's audiences.  The surprise twists at the end make you wish there was more truth to this movie.  Destined to be another cult classic from this eclectic director!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I bought these phones because I was in a temporary situation in which it was difficult to play my studio monitors at any volume, and I needed to do some preliminary cleaning up of tracks and mixing.  I've always had pretty poor results trying to eq or mix over phones, but these did very well, They sound flat, and have the required upper mid and high end detail needed for basic sound work.  The rough mixes I did transported quite well to loudspeakers.<br /><br />I understand the the ear pads do not always last long, and they are a little hot, but this is the price you pay for a good seal and outside sound insulation. In short, if you're looking for something that is reasonably flat, and reasonably emulates a pair of studio monitors, these are a good choice.  I personally like the sound of dead-flat monitors, but this may not be to eveyone's taste for home listening.  if you want hyped-up bass, or a nice \\"warm\\" sound with the high mids scooped out, these are probably not for you.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|I enjoy this even thought it's partisan....but well written and the entire cast is very good - they work well together and the story lines are interesting.  Good show, especially in an era when there is nothing but stupid reality (not) shows.
0812982622|5.0|combines the history & shadowy government situation in  North Korea with the individual's quest for personal happiness.  A masterful book.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|I loved the movie- a fresh idea finally! The small romance was maybe not needed, but still tied together well.
B00915G6MG|5.0|GREAT-- Great character development  & story line.<br />Non-stop action and  plots. Leaves you guessing<br />what will happen next. Loved it !
B00E3BK0QQ|3.0|I play a lot of G5 games and most of them are better than this. The zoom is miniscule.  Yet many of the items they expect you to find are impossible to see on the kindle.
B002OQT928|5.0|Kids love it, parents will even have some laughs! My daughter watches it over and over and I still think it's funny, too.
B004EPZ03Y|5.0|My family has missed the Muppets.  This has great music and a cute story.  I recommend this for every family.
B009WUAK2M|2.0|I do not like this movie. It has not content, subtance, even with many of famous person in the movie
B00BAYLS1K|5.0|If you enjoy dancing, this is a great movie.  It's very quirky but a lot of fun for everyone in the family.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is one of the best shows I have ever watched. It's funny, smart, bold , fresh and entertaining. Awesomeness !!
B0089J29C6|5.0|My family has had this movie on VHS and DVD.  It was only natural that we would get it on BLU-RAY.  This movie truly shows Monroe's best acting.  Great supporting cast.
0486475824|5.0|I purchased this book for my daughter because she had to read it for school. She found the study guide chapters to be very helpful and found that after using them for about the first half of the book, she was able to read the rest of the book and pretty much understand it without having to use the guide. Even though it took her more time to read, she definitely got a better grade on the book exam than if she had not had the study guide. I would recommend it to everyone. In fact, I am going to be on the lookout for this type of book (with study guide) in the future.
B002ZG98J6|4.0|This movie is great on its own but if you are a person who enjoys strict adaptation from the book, you will be disappointed.  My children like the action a lot.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and would read it again for sure. I even suggested it to a couple of fellow readers
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|We have been waiting for this to come out ever since we saw it in the theater.  A must have for Star Trek fans.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I love angry birds to pass time sitting in my car waiting for the kids to get out of school...Like the different things you can do with the star wars version :)
6310292196|5.0|We have loved this movie ever since we first saw it.  Getting it on Blu-ray was a real treat.  Good buy!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I read this entire series in a matter of days. Very different from anything else I had ever read, and to be honest I had no clue what I was buying when I bought it. I just knew it had been a best seller for months and thought I would see what all the hype was about. I was VERY surprised but did really enjoy the series...
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Just great! Challenging and engaging. It could definitely be addictive, so enjoy it but be careful. I recommend it to everyone that want to have fun.
B008XG1X18|3.0|This is a different way to look at pinterest and I prefer it on my PC to my kindle by far.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Excellent writing. I was connected to the characters by the writer in such a way ....woven into every strand of the story!  I found myself weeping with the characters. What beautiful  story lines. I want more!
B004SBX112|4.0|Angry Birds in any of its many forms is always a favorite of mine. Like different versions to keep me interested
B005LAII80|5.0|Easily the best movie adaptation of the Judge Dredd comics. It erases that horrible Stallone/Snyder version out of mind.<br /><br />For those comparing it to \\"The Raid: Redemption\\", don't. \\"Raid\\" went into production AFTER Dredd, and they rushed their movie to market (which shows) after they ripped off the Dredd storyline.<br /><br />Dredd shows what you can do with a small budget, good writing, and some decent direction and acting. Also, it shows that movies shouldn't be watered down to a PG-13 otherwise they lose their grit and become soulless.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Downloaded this game because of my strange love for these little yellow characters but am not a fan of the game. My son however loves it. Just not my type of game...
B00C3HN1RM|5.0|Really good books. Love the excitement and intense scenes. Enjoyed them all. Brand new books came in the mail on time
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a great series and I read the whole series in a week. Very enjoyable and different from my previous reads. Look forward to seeing the movie in November
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|Very informative.  Most times you like a musical group for their work but you don't know what's happening behind the scene.  I would recommend this video to everyone interested in music.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a great series and I read the whole series in a week. Very enjoyable and different from my previous reads.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|A Die Hard movie is a Die Hard movie, i.e., things blow up, vehicles get crashed, gunfire is fast and furious and there are funny dialogue bits. Wouldn't watch again but don't regret watching it the once.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read this entire series in a matter of days. Very different from anything else I had ever read, and to be honest I had no clue what I was buying when I bought it. I just knew it had been a best seller for months and thought I would see what all the hype was about. I was VERY surprised but did really enjoy the series...
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|Love the Rock, Love the Willis but didn't love this movie.  Liked it well enough because I like shoot 'em up action movies in general but wouldn't watch it again or recommend it highly.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and did enjoy the movie more because I had read the book and was more emotionally attached to the story.
B00DM0UTPQ|5.0|I Enjoyed This Movie.  It Was Interesting To Watch As I Volunteer At The Maritime Museum Of San Diego And Our B39 Was Used For BotH Exterior And Interior Scenes And I Watched As They Filmed.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a great series and I read the whole series in a week. Very enjoyable and different from my previous reads. Do not think I would have enjoyed the movie had I not read the book. The movie misses out on so much that helps build this story.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|It works. It works! The color is as ordered. The length seems apropriate. I wish the power end would also plug into the wall socket.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I read this entire series in a matter of days. Very different from anything else I had ever read, and to be honest I had no clue what I was buying when I bought it. I just knew it had been a best seller for months and thought I would see what all the hype was about. I was VERY surprised but did really enjoy the series...
B00DMEQP46|4.0|There is the hit-you-over-the-head-with-a-baseball-bat track \\"Your Life is a Lie.\\" There is the spaced-out trip of Alien Days. Then there is the 60s-esque pirate ditty \\"Plenty of Girls in the Sea.\\" These are the \\"singles\\" caliber songs. But then there are the futuristic cuts, \\"Cool Song No. 2,\\" \\"I Love You Too, Death,\\" and \\"Orphan of Fortune,\\" which are just intriguing enough and slightly out-of-reach to make you want to come back for more. \\"Cool Song No. 2\\" might be the best song her, with its driving beat and intriguing lyrics: \\"Maybe we share the dream/For twenty nights in a row/I would feel better, knowing I was alone.\\" I feel like they are no longer transcending their influences, at times calling to mind the wall-of-sound of \\"Loveless,\\" at times bringing to mind the sharp pop  of the Kinks or Velvet Underground, and often bringing to mind the trippy hyper-production of a more-accessible (read: better) Brian Eno, or Animal Collective's Centipede Hz. A couple complaints: I wish there was a \\"Siberian Breaks\\" or \\"Metanoia\\" loosely strung together jumble-pop freak out; the tracks don't have as much of a unique flavor knotting them together as they did on the first two albums; and the cover song, \\"Introspection,\\" as these guys are creative enough to come up with their own, better-written song. I cannot say this is an all-time classic like \\"Congratulations\\" and \\"Oracular Spectacular\\" but still very worthy of repeated listens, dissection and enjoyment.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I get to take my facebook with me wherever I go. What could be better than that! Try it. You'll like it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Love it! Does exactly what I need it to! It keeps track of all of my important memos and information.
B002UZXJA6|5.0|I love listening to this as it helps my moods and helps to relax me when having stressful day...great for the soul
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|its a great product with a very affordable price. One negative is it needs improvement in streaming local video files. It is too choppy.
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|Very intense and addicting!!! It really draws you in. Kinda creepy too but totally worth the $14.99!!! Watch this movie!!!!!
0525421580|5.0|Long ago, I became entranced by John Green and his work. I recently purchased and read \\"Will Grayson, Will Grayson\\" and let me tell you I'm in love with this book. Although I am a straight, girl I feel like I can relate to o.w.g., Will Grayson and Tiny. The book's overall message is universal and captures your heart. If you're looking for a good book that doesn't take too long to read, I recommend this one.
B000OJFV4C|4.0|The series is entertaining.  It is a little racy for me however my husband really enjoys it.  We've noticed the story isn't always historically accurate but entertaining.
0062080237|2.0|I bailed about chapter 7.  Just couldn't get into it.  I didn't care about the characters.  Too many side stories.
B003F44QRQ|4.0|It's a cult classic you'll either love or hate. Filmed in Santa Cruz California and being one of the kitchier vampire movies out there from the 80's it's a personal favorite of mine and reminds me of being a kid.
B006CDCWDM|5.0|Rafa is my favorite player and his book is very interesting reading for tennis fans.<br />Most people who simply watch on TV don't realize what an excellent role model this young man is for all young athletes.<br />Charmed by the down to earth life style of such a talented and celebrated athlete.
B00DMEQP46|5.0|Album has some great new tracks as well as some 1968 flavor. \\"Your Life is a Lie\\" is Excellent. Introspection is the song from 1968 originally done by a Long Island musician/song writer, Faine Jade.  Although the original is a softer, cleaner version, MGMT overdrives the base and adds a 60's sounding distortion, also very good. The lead track is \\"Alien Days\\" and also has that hard sounding base and drums. It goes from soft and gentle to hard and trashy.  Only 10 cuts on the CD and I was looking for 12,but the 10 are definitely worth the price.  Great mix of musical variations and styles. CONGRATULATIONS MGMT!!
B004EPYZP8|5.0|There is something so satisfying about seeing two really smart people in a battle of wits. It's one of my favorite plot devices. For me, another favorite is handsome men...and look at this cast:<br />  * Matthew McConaughey (\\"We Are Marshall\\") is a slick, successful, street-wise lawyer, but he actually believes in Justice. His office is a Lincoln town car.<br />  * Ryan Phillippe (\\"Breach\\") is his client, accused of rape and attempted murder. This baby-faced character presents quite a quandary: Is he or is he not guilty?<br />  * Josh Lucas (\\"Glory Road\\" - I've been a fan since \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\") is the prosecutor confronted by death of a thousand cuts. It's not as bad as it sounds.<br />  * Michael Par&eacute; (\\"Hope Floats\\" and for you hard-core fans, \\"Eddie and the Cruisers\\") is a frustrated detective.<br />  * John Leguizamo (\\"Moulin Rouge!\\") is the fast-talking street guy who pulls our hero into the game.<br />  * William H. Macy (\\"Shameless\\") is our hero's right-hand man, quick, resourceful...and funny.<br />  * Laurence Mason (LOTS of TV) is his chauffeur; he has the best line: \\"You're nobody 'til somebody shoots you!\\"<br /><br />The female roles are mostly window dressing except for Frances Fisher (\\"Jolene\\") who plays the accused fellow's mother; the script has plenty of laughs, with many upbeat characters and a twisty plot worth following. By the time we know what happened, we still can't see where we're going.<br /><br />All in all, this is an exciting, satisfying, well-shot film with plenty of people to root for, very little profanity, no car chases and no blowie uppie stuff.
B001DF68MA|5.0|After reading various reviews, I was worried that it would not fit my bike (univega alpina) or my son (a 28 lb 2 year old). But, it is wonderful, fits, and my son loves riding in it. Be careful though because my son can grab the handle bars and often drags the bike off course when he swerves to look at something with his hands still on the handle bars.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|The detail in this movie is amazing! Jim Carrey does a superb job and I watched it again last night. Who says it has to be Christmas time to watch Christmas movies?
B0019OP0GU|5.0|absolutely loved it. the trailer and interview. bryan from b'ville ,ok. keep it up with the studies and movies emma.
B00005LOUP|5.0|I could and do watch Christmas movies all year and this adds such a great twist to an old classic.
B0062X4SS4|5.0|What's not to like?  The setting is interesting, the story fascinating and the recipes inspiring.  Easy read for students of Spanish.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|I absolutely love this movie and never get tired of watching it! This is such a staple to watch at Chrismas time and honestly funny enough to watch year round.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This series is do amazing. I can never seem to put the book down. I really hope Sylvia comes out with the next installment sooner rather than later
B004LWZW24|3.0|I was a bit disappointed in this movie. the previews led you to believe it would be alot scarier than it was. how can you have a horror movie that plays the song &#34;Tip Toe Through the Tulips&#34; in the background???
B005544V6A|4.0|A somewhat different story line.  I found it enjoyable, finished the last<br />episode of session 1 and and looking forward to season 2
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I thought it was an excellent historical novel.  I just had to re-read the last chapter, perhaps my fault.  Should not have been reading in bed.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Naturally it had a draw to finish once I started but on reflection<br />it was a beach read that did nothing to enhance the roll of women<br />but did have me feel like I was reading pornography. Ok for a diversion<br />but there are so many books that entertain from a more positive perspective
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I love this show. Its interesting without having to add in sex, murder, or drugs. I would suggest it to any of my friends.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Has there ever been a TV program or TV hero like Dexter? Will there be another one in the future? Will miss Dexter after Season 8 ends. Does any viewer of this program actually think that Dexter should be punished/get the 'needle'? Like all the past seasons, once you start, you cannot stop.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I was recommending this book to friends after the first chapter<br />.ex tv in. Don't normally go for science fiction but this I couldn't put down! Already on the second book!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I like the dual function of the sharpener. I don't have to do rough sharpening with the carbon and then go get my crock stick. It's all right there.
1609611543|5.0|It's true!  Restricted wheat and starch consumption and am losing weight on average of 1-2 pounds a week.  While eating less there is no feeling of starvation.  I am satisfied with what I eat and don't get the &#34;longing&#34; for bread or sweets.  This is a unique result for me. I found Dr. Davis' explanation of the history of wheat fascinating; should be required reading.
B0047Y0FGY|1.0|One of the worst books of the summer that I have read. Cannot think of a good thing to say about it. It seems to be a summary of events in her life presented in a comic format which got really old after the first 50 pages. Sorry, just did not care for this pointless storyline with no overriding theme that I could ferret out.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. That might be because I had no expectations when I decided to watch it. The plot moved a good pace and the movie was a lot of fun to watch. Reminded me a bit of the original Robocop movie. A lot of violence and some dark satire.
B007ZLKK9I|4.0|Great insight into George's life and who he was a person. I was most interested in his spiritual pursuit and enjoyed learning about how he incorporated spirit into a material life. It's not easy to mesh both especially when you are are immersed in fame.
B00BEIYMTW|5.0|This is an awesome movie. once again Disney does not disappoint in any way. this movie may feel like a ripoff of cars but it holds it's own and you have new characters to love. I personally like el chupacabra I thought he was the funniest character. this is a great movie for kids and the young at heart or for whoever likes Disney movies. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do
B000W965QW|4.0|A book that doesn't cut corners out take the easy way out when it comes to relationships. Hornby knows how to ask serious questions and pull at our emotions. Good to pick and put down, or tear through. Although this book didn't change my life drastically, it made me think a lot about the relationships I have and what direction I'm headed. Excellent buy, glad to have read it.
B005M68S4W|5.0|Great music standards sung by phenomanal singers hand picked by Tony Bennett.  Smooth listening for driving in the car.  Enjoy!
B008SVFX96|5.0|Have only listened through once, but Richie's got some really awesome guitar work on this CD - sadly, more than we've heard in the last few Bon Jovi albums.  Would LOVE to see him back with the band, but he's also clearly talented on his own.  I will be playing this one over and over!
1612680003|4.0|I fully enjoyed this book. It did give me some things I didn't know about money investing and savings.  However, for someone who doesn't have the means to go out and buy buy buy, it's a bit disappointing.
B00DU73T08|5.0|I thought that it followed the book very closely and really had good actors and actresses to play the main parts. would recommend.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|The Anker 8000 seems be one of those \\"most bang for your buck\\" items.  It looks nice and the response time is excellent.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I saw the cornball Judge Dredd movie with Stallone, and immediately disregarded this new movie when it came out, believing it would be like the old one. I could not of been more wrong, and feel bad for not seeing this one in theaters! This movie turned me into a Dredd fan. It's got great action, good characters and a deeper narrative and message that is only there if you want it. It does not hit you over the head with some great social narrative, and there is no cringe inducing dialogue where they try to draw a connection to modern day society. It's just a solid action flick. This and Die Hard sit together as \\"How to do an action movie 101\\". I want more, I want a sequel.
B00846REIS|5.0|I liked the story line to this better than the 50 shades books, while there are some similarities in this book to the 50 shades as others say I think that these books still stand alone.  If you are more into the story and not the steamy, then you will love these books!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Great book, kept me very interested.  I loved the characters and the author didn't drag on, got right to points.  Very entertaining.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST SHOW EVER!!!! I LOVE DOWNTON ABBEY!!!! I can't wait for the next season to air soon
B000056HE9|4.0|Do you believe in guardian angels? I would like to. Here we have a Bishop in both secular and spiritual problm. He i a good man who can't handle the problems until  guardian angel comes to his aid. But, as i turns out, guardian angelshave feelings too and while trying to help the bishop, starts developing strong feelings for the Bihop's wife. This story happens at Christmas so I do watch it every Christmas.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|It's a good game all u can do is grind but u are a best so what do u expect when u are a super killer from a diff realm so what do u think
B00005JN8Z|5.0|This is the story of the struggles of Christians in Rome. And a caesar that could not stand the idea of another god wih which to compete
0752847856|4.0|Am on the second book & have number 3 on the shelf. will be an author I will have read all his books & look for the new<br />One to come out
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|Very good documentary, I really liked how they showed all the bands that recorded there and how sound city changed the way music sounds.
1416511946|5.0|An excellent  read and very well put together with plenty of commentary from other people affiliated with the band and the hard rock scene of the mid-80s. A must have for any Crüe fan and even if you're not, it's still highly entertaining!
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|I absolutely loved it and had so much fun doing all the different puzzles and the story line was cool and my son loved playing it with me and helping me
B009KS4XRO|4.0|A very fun game, I really enjoy playing it! I like the choices of rooms. It keeps me entertained at night!
B002QNTNL6|4.0|Fun movie loved watcHing it when I was having a Llandudno day.  It is definitely a girly teenager movie.  Enjoy
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the best game that I have downloaded! My daughter absolutely loves it! She said that the only thing missing is that she cannot actually ride the horse! She loves taking care of Beauty and would spend hours playing if I would let her! This game also allows you to play WITHOUT spending extra money. She is up to level 9 and cant wait until she plays again.<br /><br />P.S. I also enjoy playing this game! Its great for all ages!
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Wish the graphics were a lot more defined so that during the hidden object searches u don't have to look so aggressively because you've wasted time zooming in. N energy could be increased more exponentially wen u level up. The limited energy makes it hard to get multiple tasks done at once.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Was great! even though this does not really take place in Chicago, nor does it really follow the law, but a great plot.
B0063IH60K|3.0|It passes the time away, not the best game i've ever played. Backgrounds could use an update, can barely see the cards.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is way too much fun. We are really reading our brains. I want more rooms now! Love! Love! Love!
1781162646|5.0|Finally. A return to his earlier writing style. I loved Stephen King's early stuff and this book is fine and streamlined and full of heart.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonder lends itself to a family reading book. It should be required reading in every school. I can't recommend it enough. I bought it for my grandchildren.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I've read a lot of Stephen King books, but this one was so different. He managed to capture a great love story along with the what if fantasy.
B009CF7JDU|5.0|Awesome movie. Remember watching this movie as a kid. Also like Matthew's work on War games. Another that takes me back.
B000000OQF|5.0|I know &#34;true&#34; GnR fans might disagree but this freshman effort was by far the best.  It changed the the face of hard rock for the better and shut  down the glam-rock inspired groups which emerged in the mid-80s bringing a faster, harder sound to the genre.
B00BSN0K1C|3.0|I was disappointed that the action figure didn't look like Henry Cavill, but more like Tony Danza. It seems to be a well articulated figure, but is smaller than the New 52 characters that DC has released (granted this is not within that line).
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Just like the first new and re-booted Trek movie, I liked this one more than I expected to.  The acting was very good, the special effects were absolutely spectacular (even on the small screen), and the script was quite well done.  It made me wish I had gotten to see it on the big screen, but...oh well.  This way I can watch it again and again on my blu-ray.<br /><br />Just like the first movie, this one pays homage to original Trek, but without going overboard on it.  That can be quite the feat and, so far, they are managing it very well indeed.  The familiar relationships between the main characters are there, all the affection and teasing, even if they are being played by new actors and there are occasional twists that we never saw in original Trek...but were sometimes hinted at.  You never know when an old name (with a new face) will appear and it keeps you guessing--are they the same as what we've seen before, or will they turn out to have a very different role in things.  I really do enjoy the alternate universe they are exploring in this series.<br /><br />I am especially enjoying the new (old) McCoy and a very sassy and spitfire Uhura.  Hey, we always knew she had it in her!  Kirk is wild and footloose in his personal life and yet dedicated to his ship and his crew.  Once again, some things never change...for good reason.  Spock...well, some part of me will always see Leonard Nimoy, but the actor we see in this series is definitely growing on me.  I really like the new Scotty; we get to see much more of the humor in his character, even as he is still a genius with engines.<br /><br />The movie opens with Kirk having been demoted for one of the issues he was always getting into on old Trek--playing fast and loose with the Prime Directive.  I guess some things never change.  However, nothing keeps Jim down long...because soon Star Fleet needs him again once they are under attack by a brilliant and dangerous man who is out to destroy them.  Kirk and the Enterprise are sent to bring back this criminal from no less than the Klingon homeworld, where any mis-step could result in war between the Federation and the Klingon Empire.  Can anyone see what is coming next?<br /><br />I won't give away any of the plot twists and secrets, but this one definitely will bring back old memories and revisit them in a new way.  I found myself crying ONCE AGAIN...THANKS!  Still and all, I think this movie will please both the old and new generations of Trek fans.  I look forward to another movie and what they will do in the future.  Keep em coming!!!!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I was overtaken by the book. I could not wait to keep reading on.  I have always connected with Neil Gaiman's words but, this time I found myself viewing the world trough a seven year old version of me again.  Each character and descriptions awoke  memories that brought me closer  to the story.
B00AMZ11QK|5.0|I really like this album. The vinyl version contains a CD copy of the album, so if you want this and the CD version is sold out just get the vinyl! Brilliant!!
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|Jessica Lange at her best in this series.  Looking forward to season 3 with Kathy Bates in it.  Each Season is a different theme and story. Beware with children the themes are dark and violent.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Brad Pitt was really awesome this film started as exciting as War of Worlds and Resident Evil.  The ending was not as exciting as the beginning. All in all  enjoyed it tremendously.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|The only thing that would have been better is if they had an option to watch the original theatrical version. Most of the new crap is distracting and really takes away from the movies. Case in point; Han talking to Greedo, then a few minutes later he's saying the EXACT SAME WORDS to Jabba (not to mention the whole Han shot first controversy). Oh well, still great movies.
B0053ZOQMK|4.0|it was a good movie and good quality! I enjoy and recommend it to any age. reflects on society and fairness
B00A9X9VAI|3.0|There's a lot about Looper I really appreciated. The gritty realism, the believable characters, the philosophical and moral dilemmas. It's definitely worth checking out if you're a fan of sci-fi. I guess I'd say what brings the movie down is some of the more convoluted plotting in the beginning. There isn't much world-building and the main story wanders for a good 40 minutes or so. The movie makes use of alternate timelines but doesn't always make that clear, so many viewers will be lost for a while. Fortunately, the end payoff is worthwhile, so I recommend sticking with it, but I don't think the movie needed to have such a convoluted beginning.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|After reading the entire series a second time, I have found  greater appreciation for both A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons. I understand why people were initially disappointed as it is true, the story doent advance much and new characters are introduced. The first time through, I was so bored with reading about the Martells. I found myself just skimming those chapters. After also having  watched the first three seasons on HBO I know how the story goes and appreciated digging into the characters more than just wanting to know what was going to happen next.<br /><br />There were a lot of things I forgot or overlooked the first time all because I was in such a hurry to find out what was going to happen next. I think once you are done with your first read go back and read them all again and enjoy the depth of these characters George RR Martin has given us.
B0085CXVOC|5.0|Comparison to the books stops here. I was  a little skeptical at first, but as the move rolls, one falls into Mr. Pitts ways. Excellent - 9.2 out of ten
B00000AFDW|5.0|Great CD! If your a kiss fan like me u need this cd, with all the boys back together it's a kiss classic.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|For boys and girls alike, the ladies do give you points for your Ingenious side wanting to watch a girly movie with them. I found it quite enjoyable will watch AGAIN
B006Y9DY8Q|5.0|Great quality and good movie a bit difficult during the purchasing process but other wise a good buy for the price.
B003TQ50V6|5.0|Saw this when it first came out and was pleasantly surprised, this movie can be watched time & again, its also filled with actors just starting out
B00785P2QC|5.0|Easy to play and follow. Not too many problems at all. Fast and fun for anyone who has some extra time.
0060899220|5.0|I am not a professional cook, but I really enjoy cooking and have chef friends.  I bought this for my brother, who works in the cooking industry and has a number of horror stories being in the trenches of a kitchen during rush time.  He read it in one sitting, laughing hysterically, and professed that this book is the &#34;Spinal Tap for the cooking world&#34;.  This book is a completely authentic look at a career chef and his ups and downs in the business.  I read it in one sitting, and though I have never worked in the food industry, could relate and found the book really funny.  Very good read, I think anybody could appreciate this.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game is alot of fun. i like that i dont have to spend any money on this game and still have alot of fun playing .the gameloft team  updates it well. factions are a nice addition. and the warfare can get sick.
B006CHML4I|4.0|I just opened it and set it. It's bilingual for the day (Spanish and English). I *really* like the minute emphasis... the hours are there on the inner ring of the face, while the minutes are more prominent on the outside. I thought it might be weird, but I really, really like it.<br /><br />My watch came with insurance, the packaging was great, and it came with an instruction manual. No problems there.<br /><br />The band is quite small. In fact, I think it's smaller than any watch I've ever seen. I'm ok with it. The face is fine size-wise, but the band is pretty dang small. Also, on twisting it around, you definitely here the tingy whirring inside. I'm only remarking on it because everyone else did... I have no idea if that's a quality issue or not.<br /><br /> I feel like a sheep-employee from Arrested Development admitting to that.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It was everything that I expected it to be. At least with three books in one I don't have to go searching for the next book. It's well worth it too.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|True to the movies, lots of fun. My 5 year old son loves it too - the we can both play it together.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I play BTD 5 on my pc during lunch, and have leveled up for some time now. Recently I bought the app for my Kindle, but I cannot find a way to link my accounts together so as I gain rewards on my pc, I have access to the same on my tablet. Fix this please. Until then I guess I will have two accounts.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is just great been playing for over an year have fun playing. was a higher level but kindel crashed and not starting over
B00CIHWTHU|5.0|The Birds is one of my favorite movies. Tippi Hedren looks ever more beautiful, if that is possible, in the Blue ray edition of the DVD. I am unhappy that it's Hitchcock on the jewel box cover instead of Tippi, (as is depicted in the little icon in the upper left).<br />It took forever to get the DVD. Amazon repeatedly pushed back the date of the shipment and then cancelled the order altogether stating it was unable to obtain it. I was pleased when Amazon connected me to this seller who came through. The condition of the DVD's (I bought two) was perfect. Delivery was delayed, but I  am just glad to have the movie in Blue-ray
0525953728|5.0|I can hardly believe this is true == what a story !  I read the whole book in one day (summer, and I was not working).  WOW !  Every American can be happy that adventurers like these help protect us.
B005GSZZ1A|3.0|Unique insight into a country that is closed.  Evil breeds in closed spaces and North Korea is a prime example of such.  Communication is cleansing sunlight under which this sort of thing dries and shrivels.  Dictators rightly fear exposure.
B00005Y7KX|5.0|The music to the musical Notre Dame de Paris is unforgettable.  The story, written first by Hugo, is adapted by two French Canadian geniuses.  My students love this as well.
B00BTZN91C|5.0|This album is extremely addicting I absolutely love it! I can not stop listening I definitely love the new direction this album has taken. My favorite songs are Can't Stop and Counting Stars!
B0055V6EZE|3.0|Like, 'Didn't It Rain', Needs more upbeat to the music. Some of the songs had a little more, ZIP, to them
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Homeland is a terrific series.  I don't have the channel on which it appears, Showtime, but bought the series on a recommendation and now have purchased the second season.  Every episode is filled with terrific acting and great acting, plenty of drama and a realistic timeline.  It's worth the purchase.
B002QUWYWE|4.0|Great adaptation, but missing so much suspense provided in the novel. Still worth the watch, though. Stephen King through and through.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|My wife and I really enjoyed this film.  Great surprises await everyone who watch and trick ending--get it? Can't figure out why it wasn't big st the box office
B000A1GXTQ|4.0|This is a typical British movie with all the manners expected of them. Robert Donat never changes from scene to scene. It was suppose to be a thriller, yet, I was not thrilled.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I love this app it is not 99&cent; but it is well worth it I highly recommend it to anyone no matter their intrest
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is so much fun because you can buy characters with the game money and I guarantee you will not be disappointed with the game!!!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Mark Luttrell, is a twin and both of these men became Navy Seals. Can you imagine the stress that would put on a Father & Mother?<br />You will sit on the edge of your seat as you read this book. You will gain a great amount of respect for &#34; Men&#34; that do some of the difficult work to keep American's living in a safe environment at home.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|Quick and fun to play.  My kids and I pull it out to play when we don't want to get involved in a serious board game.
B00005JNTX|4.0|great movie, dark and gritty, and amazingly sexy. i recommend it to anyone who likes film noir. its a lot of fun, in a dark, gloomy kinda way.
B00F35BV64|3.0|Movie was great, but the sound from Amazon streaming was just awful. We had to turn it WAAAY up just to hear dialogue.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Fantastic read with a very detailed account of Piper's life in prison. Her story breaks the stigma that plagues men and women alike when they mention they are in jail.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I was so happy to be able to get this on the kindle app on my phone before I had the book in my hand. I started watching the series on television and got into the books recently, I just can't wait for the other books to come out, it was a fantastic read.
1594746036|3.0|So this book came out a while ago, and I kept meaning to read it, and then I kept not reading it because shiny new things kept catching my eye, until finally I was in a used bookstore with my boyfriend (yep, our dates are awesome) and found a hardcover copy in perfect condition, and how can anybody resist that?<br /><br />You should know that this review is a little spoilery, although it doesn't really broach anything that I as a reader hadn't guessed pretty early on in the book.  So, spoilers if you're not a guesser?<br /><br />The way this story is told really interests me.  Incorporating found photographs could get really gimmicky, but I think it works quite well in this case; it's used with care and restraint.  In fact, this is just all-around a really well put-together book, visually.  Which is good, because it starts slowly; it took me a while to really get into what was happening.  It wasn't until Jacob finally arrived in Wales--68 pages in--that I started getting really interested in the story.  Most of the beginning was necessary, and I'm not actually sure how it could have been more engaging, so I probably shouldn't complain.<br /><br />Once he does get to Wales it's a very locational, atmospheric story, and I do love that sort of thing.  I'm normally not turned on by freak-show stories, but this one does pretty well; I love the concept for where they're hiding, as well as the fact that birds are time travelers.  BIRDS ARE TIME TRAVELERS.  That's one of those things that just sounds RIGHT--it's fairy-tale logic, put forth with no explanation or apology.<br /><br />A lot of this book has fairy-tale logic.  I love fairy-tale logic.  But it causes some problems, because sometimes it feels like this book can't decide if it's using world-logic (Grandpa fought in a war and is therefore traumatized) or dream-logic (birds are time travelers, deal with it).  This occasionally causes some problems where it's hard to tell which logic is being employed: our kid's psychiatrist says he should go to Wales and instead of questioning his effectiveness as a psychiatrist we're just going to send him to Wales and let him wander around unsupervised with people we don't know despite the fact that he's behaved in a mentally unstable fashion and we probably should be keeping an eye on him.  I don't want to say plot holes, but, plot holes, sort of.  Especially later on, in ways that I can't talk about because they're spoilery.  There's a fairly significant contrast between the real world and--for lack of a better term--Miss Peregrine's world, and they don't always fit together perfectly.  But then, portal fantasy is hard to pull off without moments of weirdness at the best of times, and this story is very, very different from most other portal fantasies I've read, so it's not like there's a precedent to go off of.<br /><br />Huh.  I have startlingly few thoughts on this book.  All in all, I enjoyed it.  It was interesting, and it held my attention.  It didn't grab me; I wasn't emotionally affected by it.  I wasn't on the edge of my seat demanding to know more, or aching for the characters' plight.  I think it was more of an intellectual experience for me than an emotional one--I just liked seeing the eccentricities of the world and the way they interacted with real life.  I wasn't absorbed by the characters, but I was really fascinated by the concepts, and that in itself is a very good reason to read a book.  As concept stories go, this one was unique and very cool, and I had fun with it.<br /><br />Two things you might find interesting:<br /><br />The ending sets up a sequel, although I don't know if there's going to be one.  I think it can stand as it is, but a lot of people will disagree with me, so, open ending alert!<br />Those photographs?  They're all vintage.  They were not manufactured for this story; they were found this way.  Complete with the weirdness.  And then incorporated into a story about weirdness.  Remember how I said this was more of an intellectual book for me?  My intellectual brain thinks that's AWESOME.  (And sounds like a ridiculous amount of work.)s was more of an intellectual book for me?  My intellectual brain thinks that's AWESOME.  (And sounds like a ridiculous amount of work.)
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We heard all the buzz.  Everyone was talking about it.  Now we know why.  Great way to catch up on what we mised.
0553212753|3.0|CLASSICS TIME! You heard right - I'm reviewing a reeeeeal oldie. But this IS my first time reading this book and I DID read it for a class called Studies in Children's and YA Literature, so honestly it seemed like a good thing to do. Also, I had to read this in like two days I deserve this. ANYWAYS! Let's get this show on the road! I apparently have a really inflammatory opinion about the end of this book, according to my classmates, so this should be FUN.<br /><br />This is usually where I put a summary of the book, but the blurb (which I stole from Amazon this time, not Goodreads) is pretty self explanatory. What's most important to me is that it talks about how there are two parts to this book. The blurb calls them I and II. I call them Part I: Where Every Chapter is a Morality Story and Part II: The Bit Where Life Gets REAL. With just Part I, this book gets maybe 2, 2 1/2 stars for morality inducing boredom. With Part II? I might never re-read it, but PLOT TWIST OF THE CENTURY, ALCOTT, BRAVO.<br /><br />But I'm getting ahead of myself.<br /><br />Part I, as I continue to say is ... cute. Each sister has one negative quality that their mother, Marmee, has to teach them how to control. It's all \\"Be less material, Meg\\" and \\"Be less temperamental, Jo\\" and \\"Be less spoiled, Amy\\" and \\"Be less shy, Beth.\\" I didn't get annoyed to the point of wanting to hurl my Kindle across the room (which I've done before with morality books), but it got repetitive and boring and I really just wanted something to happen. All together, the themes were quite good and I certainly applaud Alcott for several, radical for the times decisions that she made about the girls' lives, both here and in Part II.<br /><br />But then came the romance between Meg and John. I cried. I cried hard. 1800S INSTA-LOVE! I cried. THAT'S A THING THAT'S A THING. I knew much of the later book would revolve around Jo, Amy and Beth's marriages, so seeing this horribleness made me worried, fast. I couldn't stand Meg and John's \\"romance,\\" let alone three more. (This was my first time reading it, people who've read this before and think I had trouble with math/facts. SHH about Beth.)<br /><br />But THEN came Part II, and all the reality it brought with it. Suddenly, the girls weren't just learning cute little life lessons. They were learning life facts, and learning them hard. They were learning them with whiplash. All the radical ideas that Alcott had hinted at in the beginning came out in force. (I'm an English major, we analyzed this, SHH.) But the biggest part for me was THE BIGGEST SHIPPING PLOT TWIST IN ALL OF TIME. Like, I'm not a big proponent of \\"all writers should read the classics,\\" but I wanted to buy millions of copies of this book and chuck them at the heads of every writer who has ever written a cliched love triangle ever. I am completely and utterly behind what happened, and it made the book really shine and stand out for me. Right at that moment, the book went from being a cute how to for kids to a real book about life and love and sadness and reality. Reality that is still reality, never mind the historical setting.<br /><br />At the end of the day, I certainly liked this book. This is one classic that I actually recommend for people to read if they have the urge. There really is a girl for everyone to relate to in this book, no matter their age, and I find that extremely important. I almost wish I had read this as a kid, just to see what I would understand now that I didn't understand then. Little Women is that kind of a book.g and John's \\"romance,\\" let alone three more.

B00AVPYT8I|5.0|I was unsure at first but then amazed to find that there are literally thousands of really good quality books listed absolutely FREE! There is something here for all tastes and the books are nicely organized by type (e.g. Thrillers, Mystery, Crime, Espionage, Romance, Political, Fantasy, Science Fiction, Children's). Navigation of the categories takes a little getting used to (you have to tap the titles to get back) but is simple once you figure it out. I would recommend this app to anyone who likes to read! Thank you - five stars!!
B005UDD1R6|5.0|Yet again a useful App for my needs such as Old Time Radio and podcasts aswell as oldtime Classic Tv.a great app !

B0002OXVDW|5.0|a classic made of classics, Who can ask for something more? a who is who, bringing joy and beauty to everybody.
B000I3W1XS|4.0|Someone's gotta point out somewhere that around 37 minutes Kirk makes an offhand comment about McCoy (who was thought to be mentally unstable) saying, \\"I hear he's fruity as a nutcake.\\"  The line, I'm sure, was supposed to be \\"nutty as a fruitcake.\\"  They must've thought it was pretty funny to leave it in the film; either that or, knowing Shatner's unwillingness to admit mistakes or correct himself (can you say \\"sabotadge\\"), Nimoy who directed this film may have just overlooked it.<br /><br />\\"Fruity as a nutcake.\\"  Ha, wow.
B00000IBVC|5.0|well finally she is back home.....it is magic to see it, in a real place not painted cardboard. It like to go to Imperial China and its court. Metha and singers are just superbs
B000I3PA8Q|4.0|Fans of Star Trek will find a lot to enjoy, and many on the fringe will probably be entertained.  An unknown entity endangers life on Earth as it tries to make contact with something or someone on the surface...  But wait, that was the plot of the first film!  And a similar theme was used in a few of the original episodes.  Seriously, didn't it occur to anyone that they'd already made a motion picture like this seven years earlier?  Perhaps they didn't care.  While there are some great scenes, situations and one-liners, I hate it when franchises re-hash the same premise.  Of course, Star Trek did that a lot.  In the first series, most episodes boiled down to one of several consistent themes:  There was the alien with godlike powers, the dying civilization in need of Kirk's guidance, some sort of advanced artificial intelligence, confrontation with an alien empire, and either going back to an earlier time on Earth or discovering an Earth-like civilization.  I think that about covers 92% of the episodes.  But if I penalize Star Trek for following its own tradition, I may as well forget the franchise entirely.  Still, though, for only one of six films [with just the original cast] I wish they would've come up with something more, well, original.  Be that as it may, I gave it three and a half stars (rounding up to four) because, after all, it has most of the Star Trek elements we love to see.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|If you enjoy music and it the history of analog vs digital recording this is a most see flick! Go see it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game.graphics are great. Love it. my six and nine year old daughters love it. Even I am playing it .
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I read this book during the time of my brother's passing. It provided serious &#34;food for thought&#34; and helped me in a most difficult time.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|I'm old enough to remember the original tongue in cheek classic w/ Stallone.  This was OK as a nod to Judge Dredd, but didn't bring it like Stallone & Bullock
B00BATWJFE|4.0|Book was really great. An easy read. Love that it was written from a male's perspective. A must read romance. Quirky and uncomfortable.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Absolutely a blast. We have a great time. Sometimes the game last 45 minutes and sometimes two hours. We are teaching our 8 year old how to play and he is catching on quickly. I recommend teens and adults figure out the rules before having kids under 12 play.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|By far best bingo &amp; slots game combined great way to meet new friend's  I love how you can interact and trade items with friends
B002VPE1AW|5.0|One of my favorite movies and I would recommend this DVD to any Sci Fi fans.  Great movie and price.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|I use it every night.  It is easy to set alarms, and even multiple alarms for weekdays and weekends.  I need to get more songs so I can listen to different tunes in the morning.  The dimmer features are really cool as well.
B000R4SMCW|5.0|Since I'm an Anthony Hopkins fan, I like all his movies.  I would recommend this DVD for any thriller lovers.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Love this game. Just wish they gave you more tokens when you scratch the card. Other than that, it's wonderful.
B0008JIJ2E|5.0|The little ingrates thought it was the newer version and the whole reason for them to see the older version was lost on them.  I wish I had not given it away.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|I like the game but the crystals come to slow and the energy refill is also slow. I hate that aspect of this type of game because it takes forever unless you spend money
B00003CXSP|5.0|I am a fan of all the Hannibal movies.  Love them all.  I would recommend it to anyone who like thrillers.  The 2-disc version did not really matter to me.

B008JFUUQ2|5.0|New, unopened, no problems.  Wife loves the movie and for this price, it's an absolute bargain for four different formats.<br /><br />Heck, my only complaint is that there isn't a full version of the Titanium duet.
0739319175|5.0|Dan Brown's story was a great addition to our collection of audio books.  I recommend this one if you like thrillers.
B006LSZECO|5.0|She appreciated the unpredictability of the plot and the overall story.  I cannot comment about the writing itself as I didn't read it, but she does rave and recommend the book to her friends.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|Love the Master and Commander series and this DVD did not fail my expectations.  I would recommend it to adventure lovers.
B00915G6MG|5.0|Since this is the only television show I watch regularly I was expecting exactly what I got.  A great show with good characters and good story lines.  Very exciting show and I do not miss a single episode.  Product was high quality and I have had no problems with any of the other seasons (all of them) that I have bought.  All of this and a very fair price.  Can not go wrong with this purchase.
B00CTSDDVO|3.0|Don't get this if your expecting a copy to put into your iTunes collection. You have to have their player or App to view the digital copy. I like to put mine on my iTunes and use my Apple TV to view so I don't have to insert DVD, unless I am watching the 3D version, then of course I have to put into the Playstation. Thats the only reason on took 2 stars off.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Good brain training. It has multiple levels of difficulty for a good game. Easy to download and start using right away.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Not a book I would recommend to anyone.  It was hard for me to finish the book, did not enjoy it at all.
0307341577|4.0|Great book overall. Started out a bit slow but finally grew to love the main character and wanting the mystery solved! This book was really really good (although not as good as Gone Girl)!<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend it. I could read over 100 pages in a sitting.
B00F35BV64|4.0|What more can I say? It was good! An exciting film with strong characters. I only need six more words!
1476733953|5.0|I've read very few dystopian novels, so I have very little to compare it to, but I did enjoy it. The story was imaginative and interesting, and the suspense was kept up throughout. I enjoyed it so much that I bought it again for my son, who said he &#34;really should read more.&#34; I've recommended it to several other people as well.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I'm ready for maybe ten or twelve more seasons of Falling Skies. This is entertainment, I don't have to worry about my part in it, I just have to enjoy it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love Catching fire.  Its' my favorite of the 3 books. I feel so much for the characters and enjoyed the series.
B003B02O14|3.0|the book is different because nothing &#34;new&#34; really happens, rather the plot is just the unfolding of events already put in place by a master plan. Because of that, the characters lack warmth and you are not really rooting for anyone. It's hard to get invested in this book, but it is still an interesting read. You do want to read more, because you are wondering... How did he do it?
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Anyone who wants to catch up on past seasons this is a must. The quality is great.  I will watch this over and over.
B009RX85N0|5.0|the serie rises up to my aksepectations. Lot's of fun looking. Only setback is that there are no dutch subtitles.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|A great book! George R. R. Martin is a priest of words more powerful than even the Red Priestess. I can't wait start his next book!!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Love these games just wish there were harder and longer ones because I finish these too quick-Also I want my sequel!!!
B004HXIZVC|5.0|This is the most progressive music app out there. I can't say enough great things about this app and website.
B00425S1H8|5.0|No problems so far.  Used to connect and query weather observation (wind speed and direction) equipment to a CanaKit Raspberry Pi kit.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I am surprised how much i enjoy this app.  I  originally got this to help my newborn sleep (worked awesome, he likes vacuum the best).... but it is really well done and beautiful to use.  it also gets new sounds to update it with periodically.  oddly enough for an app that plays boring sounds it is fun.
B00DP8XSQ2|4.0|This app is very handy when using my telescope during the night. I helps me locate and pinpoint stars, planets and other objects quickly rather than just a hit and miss method.
B00EPQQ2PW|5.0|This album really rocks. Most of the songs are fantastic and never get old. Really surprised by how much I liked the music.
0694003611|5.0|Great gift for couples having their fist child. Interactive book to read and enjoy with a toddler. Everyone will enjoy
B0044C3RB4|5.0|The character development continues to deepen in season three causing us to fall in love with Peter and Olivia all over again in spite of the crazy things around them.
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|Great little case for the money. It's not a designer real leather embroidered case hand stitched .. But does the trick
B009D0LBRO|5.0|Dang, this game doesn't only play beautifully, but it looks so great at the same time. The game has a challenge to it for people that like a bit of challenge, but is able to stay easy at the same time. The game keeps that vibrant feel that Rayman has always had and introduces a great new addition to the franchise. Sure, it's a bit expensive at first glance, but, trust me, this game is worth beyond 3 dollars. It's music, visuals, and over all addictive gameplay is completely worth it all in the end.
B005MMY9A8|4.0|It had a little too much fluff and not enough action...  Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy it...  Just left me a little incomplete...
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Quick read, fun and entertaining. It keeps the reader interested and wanting to keep reading. I read the entire book in two days.
B001THZAAI|5.0|Even with English subtitles, it is very funny.  Yes, it is a French comedy, but the humor is still very American.  Highly recommend it.
B00ET9T2WK|1.0|It is too slow and takes a lot of time to download and weak sensitivity so you have to tap 20 times before it selects...oh hell I need to stop acting smart and say it's a piece of s*** and loads every second then crashes load it up again and it crashes again.
B008I34ZFW|1.0|Couldn't wait for this movie to come out, and when it did, I could not finish it.  Thought it would be a funny sci-fi spin, but it was too political and just didn't make sense.  Don't waste your time on this.  Even the German salesman in Stuttgart was hesitant to give the movie any sort of positive approval, when I inquired about when it would come out on DVD.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|It wasn't a bad read considering I got it for free.  I thought I'd be interested in the rest of the &#34;Pride&#34; series; WRONG! I paid $2.99 for Discovering Pride; exact same story line with a different character from Finding Pride.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I couldn't wait for this to be released. I loved the other two. I love the characters in the book and Sylvia Day knows how to keep you wanting to find out more.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Great show. Not bad for the first season. Lots of twists in the plot.<br />Whole family enjoys it. Look forwards to season 2.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|Not enough directions for it.. I tried to figure it out, but totally didn't get it..very discouraging  for an app
B00CF34B2I|1.0|I tried to get it for my KF. I only have 1.17G worth of app space if I uninstall everything...this app needs 1.5G. I was excited because I've been playing MTG since Beta and wanted to try it on this format. :(
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|I thought this movie was great.  I love seeing magic shows and illusions are always fun to see.  This movie was a good one.
B00D5TASN2|5.0|What is with this guy? Stops making great movies to....... make great albums! This disc is easily one of the best of the year's and I thank God for its release. Funky, dark, atmospheric, insane and funny all at the same time. This guy's a mother-lovin' genius in every sense of the word. I'm actually buying this its that good.  so refreshing after listening to most of the backwash that's been released this year. David baby, please keep rockin'!<br />I'll sum it up:<br />JUST BUY THIS!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Love the book. Cannot wait to move onto the third  installment. I'll actually be able to be ahead of the book
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids and I both love this game.  It keeps them busy on the phone and on my kindle.  even better with the newest updates.
B0015DROBO|4.0|My daughter loved the book and the series. Well written and great story line. I'd buy it again. Well Done!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Whole family enjoyed watching the movie together--it was fun to watch.  Recommend to others especially with 12 yr old range boys.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Amazing show! Please release Season 3.  I can't wait any longer.  The first 2 seasons were great!  Looking forward to it.
B004X75RK4|4.0|Enjoyed the premise of this movie: a female boss (Sandra Bullock) from Canada learns her visa is expiring. To avoid getting deported, she asks/orders her male Yank underling (Ryan Reynolds) to marry her. And, of course, later they'll untangle the relationship. He goes to her family home (setting: Alaska) to meet the family, and, the predictable happens.<br /><br />Sandra Bullock, Ryan Reynolds, Betty White and Oscar from the office are all entertaining. It's a light romantic comedy that did very well at the Box Office which should mean something. 3.5 stars.
B0051UP5NQ|2.0|See the review by Bill Mungaven. I have the same problem - Update fails. Based on Bill's experience, I didn't try to uninstall/re-install, so I still have OfficeSuite 7 version 7.1.1237 which works OK. 2 stars for failed update!!<br /><br />HTC Flyer running Android 2.3.4 (not rooted)
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I've been addicted to this game for the last week. Fun being able to level up and not a high-pressure game.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Easy read if at times a bit disconcerting. Author's credentials and research are convincing.  Reading the history of the times is enriching.
B008CJ0KI8|3.0|As a grammy winning artist, I expected more from this performer.  The price was great but the recording just wasn't what I expected.
B009P13RQY|5.0|This is only my 2nd album from the Sword (the other being Age of Winters). I know that I will eventually need to collect the rest of their discography, because both of these records are great.<br /><br />Apocryphon is flat-out fun to listen to. The riffs are heavy and the bass and drums thunderous. Others - many others - have mentioned how the sound recalls Black Sabbath, among other bands. The 70's metal influence is strong, and yet sounds fresh among the current metal landscape.<br /><br />The lyrics are on the cheesy side, what with all of the dungeons & dragons fantasy imagery. That has never been my thing, but I find that the rock more than makes up for it.
B00913P6G0|5.0|I love Kendrick Lamar and this album.  He has brought prose back into Rap/HipHop; and the chronolgy of each piece is very nice; telling a great story.  He is the best!
B0063GORYU|4.0|I love this game, which is very well designed. However, occasionnally, the cards suddenly display in an abnormal way and it is impossible to finish the game.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Lovely graphics, interesting story line.  Mostly hidden object, with some other puzzles that weren't extremely difficult even for an occasional gamer like me.  The user can skip any puzzles they want to skip, and still keep playing the game.
B000001ES4|5.0|This is my very favorite of theirs.  The music is so beautiful it really touches my soul.  It is soothing & uplifting at the same time.  I have given it to several people & they all have said it is so pretty it makes them cry.  I highly recommend it!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love it. Very different a wonderful challenge can't wait for the next level. I like the increase in difficulty.
B004LWZW7O|4.0|In Time focuses on the future, where the world has decided to remove the gene that causes people to age. As a means to control this, you stop aging at 25 years old and they you will leave one more year unless you earn more time. Time though is also the currency of this era buying things such as coffee, hotel rooms, and meals. Overall, I loved the concept of In Time and was intrigued from the very beginning. While the concept is very interesting, there are a number of flaws which while not a deal breaker, frustrated me as a viewer such as in a world trying to avoid anarchy, the simplicity of transferring time by touch seems a bit to...simple. Maybe that's just me though. In addition, a few questions are raised that are never answered, and secondary character development is lacking making what could have been a fantastic, robust and believable world a bit cold and confusing. With that said, I enjoyed the premise and the movie. I just wish that more time had been put into it's crafting to take full advantage of the great premise at hand.<br /><br />While the film suffered from a few issues, the technical aspects of the film were nice when presented on Blu-Ray. The movie's colors and representation of fleshtones, clarity, etc. were all spot on for the environments the characters were in. The night scenes featured a nice amount of detail on the buildings and in the shadows, lending to the believability of the film.<br /><br />The soundtrack, DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, was nice and took advantage of all of the speakers. Great off camera cues, spatial dimension and subtle effects made this an overall involving audio mix. The film took advantage of the subwoofer occasionally to create solid, deep, and powerful bass. While much of the film did not require this, it was well done when used. The dialogue was solid and at a good volume in relation to the other effects.<br /><br />Parents, I would personally peg the movie for a 13 year old, depending on the family. There is some profanity (f word, some s words, etc.), some sexual content involving skinny dipping, There is also plenty of violence, some suicide, and more. While much of this is bloodless, it is something to consider if violence is a concern. There is also some drinking but there is not any use of drugs.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed In Time. While it suffered from plot flaws and basic premise issues, the film was fun and brought a new concept forward that differed nicely from the average sci-fi film. I wish more time had been spent on this and developing the other characters, but all flaws considered, I would happily watch the movie again as I feel it plays a nice commentary on modern day america, the constant struggle for life, and the class structure. Personally, this wouldn't be a movie I would purchase though, instead I would recommend renting.ofanity (f word, some s words, etc.), some sexual content involving skinny dipping, There is also plenty of violence, some suicide, and more.

B00F35BV64|4.0|Good movie lots of action watched it twice and caught a few things I didn't catch before, worth watching HOLLA !!!!!
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|My son is dyslexic and has a comorbid condition of ADHD. This series captivates my son and allows him to easily follow the adventures of these characters as he goes along, which is no small task by any means. Thank you for giving my son the wonderful world of reading :)
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I love this game it is so much fun! The only problem is the acorns. They are sort of easy to get but some ideas cost a lot of acorns.
B005CRQ4XI|1.0|I did not get enough story from this book.  The trail description was too much and boring. It climaxed only slightly at times.  The ending didn't leave me satisfied with information.  Sorry, my book club didn't like it either.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|If u like playing the super mario brothers youll love leps world<br />You are about to take on the best game known to apple lol and im on a galaxy s4 ...bla blah blah
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I have read other books by this author.  I have enjoyed all of them.  The Kite Runner movie was excellent.
1408215330|5.0|It is very good.It has a colorful pages .It is a very new dictionary.I guess you guys will like it
B003YFIUW8|4.0|My book club read this one.  It was hard to get into it at first, but ended well without you wanted to hunt the guy down yourself.
B003B02OOG|5.0|Classic pleasurable Grisham! With his usual insights into the human psyche, Grisham brings a delightful collection of short stories to his fans.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Love how it all comes together.  The Epilogue was my favorite part!  Still thinking about it. I recommended it to my book club.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|The animation is top-notch, the story line excellent.  Loved seeing the ponies as humans. A must for every pony/bronie fan!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|A book series that my kids will read and one I will definitely reread! Huzzah to Brandon Sanderson for completing this remarkable story. And, to Mr. Jordan, thank you sir!
B0087JTAKW|2.0|[[ASIN:B0087JTAKW The Time Keeper]] is the first book by Mitch Albom that I consider poorly conceived and executed. First, as many other reviewers noted, there is one theme that stands out: \\"God allows death because it makes every moment of your life precious\\". This theme is prominent, but the bulk of the book deals with a few other themes, some of them corollaries of the big one. I object to one of his lesser themes: \\"The guy who invented clocks [Father Time] has been punished [by God]\\". This punishment reminds me of the Greek myth of Prometheus, who is eternally punished for bringing fire to mankind. The punishment essentially blames all of mankind's misuses of time on this one poor inventor, who, after all, neither created time nor man's obsession and abuses of time. Father Time got a bum wrap in this book. The plot as a whole is a convoluted, fantasy contrivance that (I think) gets in the way of rather than reinforces the theme. If I had read this one before \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" or \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\", I would probably give up on Albom as an author. As it is, I recommend you skip this one and read Albom's other unique contributions.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Dragon story is a very fun game!  I love it, except that everything is so expensive .. other than that its a pretty good game.
B006X08FDA|5.0|The best voices I have ever had the pleasure of listening to. Each song is a history of the past. Soulful music
B00280LYIC|5.0|This is definitely one of my favorite books ever! I love it soooo much! The description and like, well, everything!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|If you a true story of a hero going from the bottom of the barrel in life to a true American patriot and family man this is it.
B00F35B8F8|4.0|I like the choices for the actors especially Spock,and Caption Kirk looks and sounds like the original James Kirk(William Shatner).The action and special effects are top notch.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it may be 699 but it is worth it...of course I got it for free but you can get it for 699
B005PK1G76|5.0|I researched all the options before I picked this one.  I didn't think we needed all the bells and whistles that some of the other organizers have - we just needed somewhere to stick our phones/wallets and a drink or a bottle and this does it.  We haven't had the fancier ones so maybe we don't know what we are missing but this organizer works perfectly well for us.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I fall asleep to my own melody of midnight rain every night. Cant go to sleep with out it. I have it on my phone and kindle.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows. I had already viewed the episodes on television,but I HAD to have it on DVD when it came out. Can't say enough good things about this program!!
B009VYF5E2|5.0|This DVD is absolutely great!  Now, I can watch any episode from Season #4 at any time I want.  This is a high-quality DVD and has excellent picture clarity and sound track.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|Very simple yet addicting game. You match icons to create new icons, and then use the new icons to create more icons.
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|I really tried to like it. Too many different story lines, nothing pushing me to read it. Pretty disappointed. :(
B0060MYM7O|5.0|The entire series is great.  More of the unexpected and continued on to season 3.  i can't wait for season 4.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Now I can bring pintrest with me wherever I go!! They have anything and everything you could possibly want even gift ideas, party ideas. Anything you can think of is on pintrest
B0002TJGQS|5.0|In the store you pay twice as much for two batteries. This is a good value. Give this a try.
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|Most free games ask for you to purchase more, but this one wouldn't even let you finish your turn.  After one race, it asks for money or it restarts you.  So glad it was free, but would never spend money on a game that thinks so little of its customers to not even create a true free version!
B001TH16DI|3.0|first off the collection is every trekkie's dream come true special features all great but that being said, for some reason on the Star Trek V disc, there is a slight flaw, everything up to the scene after the enterprise crew is captured by Sybok works fine but after that the movie drags, it just sits there during play and I can't even skip the scene cause it drags anywhere after this scene
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|This is one of my go to movies when I need an uplifting moment.  No matter what's going on in my life this story trumps it.  It's wonderful to see how Bethany triumphed with God and with life.
B000ICKPOQ|4.0|None of the Stargate themes would be called earth shaking. It is a form of fantasy entertainment that is better than many with its use of special effects and a believable story line.
B0036S4B6M|1.0|Aside from the fact that Piper is so patronising about her fellow inmates, this book cries out to be rewritten. Poor editing, poor structure. I felt bad for the other ladies, but not the protagonist.
1444737112|5.0|James and Bob surely opened my eyes to the real world of the &#34;street people&#34;, and I only wish every person's story would turn out so great.  Plan to order the sequel and look forward to a possible movie.  After reading the book, I checked out a lot of the internet videos, mostly on YouTube and they were a great closure to finishing the book.  I either need to purchase more copies or start a waiting list of others who want to read this story.
B00CQGU9GG|1.0|Wouldnt play in my cd player..perhaps the wrong format? The cd case read &#34;Made in E.U.&#34; and I was very disappointed
B003Q6D2BE|4.0|The movie has a good cast of actors/actresses and the movie keeps you glued to your seat with action scenes.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I dont like it! They gave the wrong information and for me is not the best so i dont whant it
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Great writer.  Great research.  On of the best books i've read this year.  I would like to read more of his work.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is really an awesome game unless it sticks. That can be very disappointing. They do give you back your credits most of the time.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Excellent follow up from Baref To You&#34;<br />Loved it! I can not wait to see what the next book holds in its covers.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Weather Live is a great app features very clean, is arranged and detailed enough to provide all the important weather facts you need for many locations. I like the fact that all weather data is at a glance on one page. Graphics are nice adding to the cool factor of the app.
B005MMZ63C|5.0|Even if you dont enjoy old movies, this is one of the best movies of all time! Highly recommended to everyone!
1577314808|5.0|I first heard about this book in Ireland in 2006 from a friend I met there .. THIS BOOK CAN CHANGE YOU LIFE in a most positive manner ..
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Predictable, fast Grisham read<br />Enjoyed Mr. Grisham’s ability to tell us a story instead of trying to teach us a lesson…  A fast, page turning, interesting “beach” read.
B00915G6MG|5.0|I love watching NCIS and the inter action of the characters.  I hope season 11 is just as good with Ziva leaving.
1781162646|5.0|For those who enjoy reading Stephen King, this book is just fine.<br />For those, like me, who could enjoy reading a telephone book written by Stephen King, this book is more than fine.
B00C5R8364|5.0|Forsyth comes through again. The Kill List is frighteningly realistic, and sadly probable in the world in which we live today.
B000QCS8TW|3.0|I am past reading dark, brooding, violent, cynical books. I found the book to be oriented toward sensationalism for its own sake.
B001EAWME2|1.0|This movie is not even close to being a mild slasher. You'd be better served watching \\"A Nightmare on Elm Street.\\"  This movie is just plain sick and disgusting to watch.  It's the total opposite of White Christmas.  This movie should have been called Halloween Hell.  Sometimes I wonder what goes through the minds of these screenwriters.<br /><br />The movie begins with the camera focusing on the five-pointed stars on the building and on the building number which is 6. Put the 2 stars and the number together and what do you get?  The movie also gave screen time to drunkenness, sexual graphics and expressions.  The sicko in the film speaks in different nerve-racking voices; so, you also have possession in this freak flick.<br /><br />Another thing you may want to know is that there is an underlying theme: abortion.  This film was released in 1974, a year after abortion was legalized.  It focuses on the right of the woman to have an abortion regardless of what the man thinks, wants or what is right.  And in very deadly terms it states that if you're against abortion you deserve to die.<br /><br />These are all unsettling and purposely crafted messages within an inhuman movie.  It's not to be watched during the Christmas season especially with loved ones and family.  In fact, if you can avoid it, it's not to be watched at all; but, if you're disposed to watch it, not without a high degree of perturbation, nausea and an inclination to jettison the entire contents of your stomach and intestines.<br /><br />Bluntly speaking, this movie is about evil and death.<br /><br />Fair warning.
B00DYVUBYM|1.0|IM SORRY BUT THIS MOVIE WAS HORRIBLE!!!.....first I need to add that im a African American male who grow up in  Brooklyn.  and  I know the justice system don't always go in the way that we want....but how is it kids can steal 3 million worth of merchandise and only get one year in jail....and others can smoke weed and get about the same amount of time..... I really feel that if it was 5 black kids in the same situation the charges would have been a lot different.  Nicky who was suppose to do 1 year ended up doing 30 days .... I cant believe you can steal 3 million dollars worth of stuff for someone and get 30 days ......GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!!
B000JMKTLO|3.0|I was very engrossed in this story. Lots going on.  But just like her other book, Gone Girl, I did not like the ending.  This author weirds you out towards the end.
B00BCX2F66|4.0|I Love this case. it protects the phone well, and helps especially for a phone without a kick stand. id definitely recommend it.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|I really bought this for the long lost Hotel California concert footage I remember watching on MTV in the 80's. The video transfer of the concert is pretty good. The audio is also pretty good. Bear in mind, this show was recorded 36 years ago...Man, that makes me feel old.<br /><br />The history itself is probably the best &#34;Behind the Music&#34; type video you will see. Interviews with ALL the band members; past and present. Not just the ones who are still in good graces. Very interesting to get the perspectives of everyone who has ever been a part of this legendary band.
B0053JJLLC|1.0|Usually I find this authors books interesting if somewhat farfetched but this one was lacking both plot details that would pull the reader forward into his reality.  Dismal.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Reading the writing of Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child is addictive .  This book read at a frenetic pace with many twists and turns.  I look forward to reading more of their writing.
0307120007|5.0|Bought this recently for a friend's baby shower.<br />I remember reading this as a child and it makes a great gift!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|It is a great game. I spend hours playing it every day.  It is the best bingo game app you can choose.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I luv this game this is my heart<br />I play this game everyday all day when i come home frm skool I play it i juss love this game soooo much so i would like u 2 rate it with more characters
B005HSG3U6|5.0|this case has to be one of my favorite cases of all.love the compact feel this case gives to me while using
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|I am enjoy using my own music as my alarm to awaken to a happy \\"up\\" beat!  Also, I pick a few of my mellower songs to play as I drift off to sleep. :) Definitely worth the $.99!<br />FOLLOWUP ... I have deleted this app from my phone.  Is was sucking all of the juice out of the battery over night, even when I did not have the time showing or the alarm set.  When I checked my phone usage, this app used over 75% of the power and my cell was dead.<br />Now, with this app uninstalled, I do not have a problem.<br />The app does what is states but it leaves the electronics unusable.
B00F35BV64|4.0|I just knew Kahn would be a bit more evil... Oh well!  It was still a good movie.  I just know there will be a third one .... &#34;The Wrath of Kahn&#34; maybe lol
B008AIGWVA|5.0|Downloaded this to my child's NABI and it has put a huge smile on her face and engaged her for the evening. Of course I couldn't figure out how to work it but she did. Nice job on this cute and entertaining and best of all FREE app!
B00024I2Z4|5.0|Purchased this as a gift to replace an original one that got misplaced.  Very good movie for families and one that you can watch more than once and enjoy.
B0060MYK7G|4.0|The Borgias never fail to be fascinating.  I find it so interesting that Rodrigo  was Pope Alexander.  There's such a dichotomy between his personal life and Papal.  I really enjoyed the series.  It is my understanding that &#34;the Borgias&#34; was supposed to run for another season, but was cut short.  I imagine due to ratings, but what a disappointment.  I would love to have seen their saga continue.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|The story feel very relatable, even though most of us can't share similar experiences. If you are a woman who has experienced even a small level of self mutilation or mother-daughter conflict, you can relate. Again, the author does a great job describing surroundings and people without overdoing it. Great book. I liked it as much as Gone Girl.
B001O1O71C|5.0|\\"What exactly was the difference? he wondered to himself. And who decided which people wore the striped pajamas and which people wore the uniforms?\\" (pg. 100)<br /><br />A story of pure innocence and the power of seeing the world through a child's eyes, The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is a simple study of the injustice of WWII. This is a moving and powerful tale that takes a subject such as this large war and takes it down to an elementary scale that our youth can better understand. I give this five stars because, had I read this in my youth, I would easily want to read it again. Even at the age I'm at now, I wouldn't mind reading it again to look more for the symbology and allusions.<br /><br />\\"`The thing about exploring is that you have to know whether the thing you've found is worth finding. Some things are just sitting there, minding their own business, waiting to be discovered. Like America.  And other things are probably better off left alone.\\" (pg. 114)<br /><br />I initially picked up this book, although it's been on my to-read list for some time, because my youngest brother had to read it for school. I read it to help him, but really, although he's only a few chapters in so far, he's helped me. For the life of me, I couldn't figure out how Bruno was mispronouncing \\"Out-With\\" and didn't know what he was supposed to be referencing; my youngest brother, through a discussion in his class, told me that it's supposed to be a concentration camp called Auschwitz, one of the largest concentration camp networks that killed an estimated 1.1 million people. After this realization I started thinking of this book in a different way. For example, I don't remember Hitler being called \\"The Fury,\\" as well as I couldn't make out whatever derogatory name the soldiers were calling the jews in the book. The Fury is Bruno's misunderstanding of \\"Der F&uuml;rer\\" and if I did re-read this book I must keep in mind to read it through the eyes and understanding of a child. I have to say, on that point, that a nine-year-old (today, at least) would be a little more aware of their surroundings and what's really going on, based off of whatever they overhear from adults.<br /><br />\\"`We should never have let the Fury come to dinner,' she said. `Some people and their determination to get ahead.'\\" (pg. 40)<br /><br />This book is a great, simple introduction to children, towards the study of the Holocaust and the travesties of the second world war. Bruno shows how he relates to people, not by basing them off their religion, looks or creed, but by their attitude, persona and treatment of others. He found a friend in Shmuel and together they defied and rose above what even grown adults could not do.<br /><br />\\"`You're my best friend, Shmuel,' he said. `My best friend for life.'\\" (pg. 213)<br /><br />First Line: \\"One afternoon, when Bruno came home from school, he was surprised to find Maria, the family's maid - who always kept her head bowed and never looked up from the carpet - standing in his bedroom...\\" (pg. 2)<br />Last Line: \\"Not in this day and age.\\" (pg. 215)<br /><br />Quotes:<br /><br />\\"`Accept the situation in which you find yourself and everything will be so much easier.'\\" (pg. 53)<br /><br />\\"`When I was a child,' Bruno said to himself, `I used to enjoy exploring. And that was in Berlin, where I knew everywhere and could find anything I wanted with a blindfold on. I've never really done any exploring here. Perhaps it's time to start.'\\" (pg. 99)<br /><br />\\"It was almost (Shmuel thought) as if they were all exactly the same really.\\" (pg. 204)<br /><br />\\"And that's the end of the story about Bruno and his family. Of course all this happened a long time ago and nothing like that could ever happen again. Not in this day and age.\\" (pg. 216)n that point, that a nine-year-old (today, at least) would be a little more aware of their surroundings and what's really going on, based off of whatever they overhear from adults.<br /><br />\\"`We should never have let the Fury come to dinner,' she said. `Some people and their determination to get ahead.'\\" (pg. 40)<br /><br />This book is a great, simple introduction to children, towards the study of the Holocaust and the travesties of the second world war.

B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Now You See Me is an old fashioned good time.  It offers a great, edge of your seat thriller along with a mystery and the added fun of totally cool magic.  There's even a little romance thrown in.  I think it's a movie that will appeal to a wide audience and even kids over about age 9 or 10 would probably get a kick out of it.  There's a lot of humor.  I just love Woody Harrelson's character for that reason.  He's the sarcastic soundtrack accompaniment to a lot of the hijinks that occur.  The basic story is that four magicians are brought together by a mysterious person to become The Four Horsemen. The group then proceed to conduct magic shows in which totally impossible feats (like robbing a bank and having all the money drop from the ceiling into the audience)are done flawlessly.  The FBI is called in to figure the whole mess out.  Mark Ruffalo plays the ever pragmatic seasoned FBI agent who is determined to find out the truth and stop the Horsemen.  The problem is that in order to arrest the magicians, the FBI would have to admit to believing that magic is real and that's not an option.  The Horsemen go on to perform more shows at different locations around the country and their actions lead to lots of action sequences, even a high speed car chase.  The ending has a surprise twist that pulls the whole thing together and leaves you with that sense of the possibility of real magic in the world.  It's a fun, smart  feel good movie.  Don't miss it.

1932100660|5.0|I wish I had known this information years ago.  About one year ago I had a heart attack and an RCA stent put in.  I followed the standard recipe for a heart patient and altered my diet to low fat, low salt, low sugar, lean meats, and 1% milk.  Stumbled upon Forks Over Knives in mid-April 2013, read The China Study over the next 5-6 days, and we made immediate changes to the Whole Food Plant Based diet.  Along with recommendations from Prevent & Reverse Heart Disease by Caldwell Esselstyn we now eat no meat, no dairy, no oil. I loved how The China Study shows you the research data, then presents the mechanism of how our body works to support the findings - over and over and over again. I have lost 39 pounds.  But, Colin Campbell points out that the diet that works best in the short run, should also be the same diet that works long term.  And, weight loss is great, but it really needs to be accompanied by other improvements.  And, it has, my Total Cholesterol is now 97, and I have an LDL of 39.  Crazy improvements. I feel this is my best chance not to end up back in the hospital like so many heart patients, including President Clinton.  A very large percentage are right back in again within 10 years, because they don't make the real changes necessary to allow their bodies to heal.  I can't recommend this book enough.  This is not a \\"speed\\" reading book.  Take your time, one chapter at a time.  Digest the information.  Read it with a pen or highlighter in hand. You will be highlighting and underlining so many sentences and ideas it's just insane. Other books to read: Dr. Esselstyn's book noted above and [...] The Starch Solution by Dr. John McDougall and [...] and the website by Dr. Greger at [...] , and the website with Dr. Neal Barnard at [...] .  I am literally betting my life on this new lifestyle.

0812983459|5.0|It isn't often that such a delicious reading experience drops from nowhere into your lap. Un-ballyhooed at least to me, until a friend recommended it, The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry caught me completely unaware. With its very traditional, straight-ahead narrative structure, the novel swept me up from the first pages. Best of all, it continued its unsuspected course to an unpredictable and altogether satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />Harold Fry is a thoroughly unprepossessing middle class Brit, newly retired from a long, undistinguished career. Stuck in a miserable, loveless marriage and going nowhere in particular, he receives a short note from a one-time colleague with whom he had long ago lost touch. Her message explains that she is at present dying of cancer and wishes merely to say goodbye. Stuck for a suitable reply, Fry pens a few inadequate words and sets off to post his letter. What follows is his \\"unlikely pilgrimage,\\" a journey of revelation, resolution, forgiveness and understanding that surprises Harold as much as it will the reader.<br /><br />Unlikely Prilgrimage reminds us how we can so completely lose our way and yet find ourselves again. Absolutely delightful.<br /><br />[ASIN:B0074D3CAQ The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry: A Novel]]
B0055L5M4S|5.0|This is positively the best darn strip light I have ever used.  I'm a DJ and I need accent lighting and pin point lighting here and there.  I know it's supposed to be used to back light your monitor so your eyes don't tire.  I'm using it as a work area light.  I used the included sticky side and set it along the inside top of my SKB rig case so that it illuminates my rack mixer and players.  The other end USBs into my laptop.  Now I have adequate light to work with.  I liked it so well I bought two more for future use.  It's really a great little strip light.

B00B84652O|4.0|I have been a King Diamond fan since the mid 80's. I love his version of the ghost story and I love how he carries concepts from album to album. His early solo stuff after Merciful fate (featured in this collection) is haunting, powerful, and really creative. The King started a lot of things in metal music and is rarely credited for his influence.<br /><br />The production value on these disks is quite good. They sound great. The collection itself would be considered by many as an unrivaled run of quality horror-metal which has not been surpassed in quality or concept even 30 years later. I would recommend, after sitting down with this mini box set that you listen to the disks in their entirety and in order. King Diamond put a lot of effort and had a lot of success creating very flowing albums where each song not only was an ordered piece of the story but had a musical flow.<br /><br />King Diamond is a story teller...and his stories are scary and sometimes grotesque...but people often don't look at it that way and don't give him the creative respect he is due. These 5 disks are really a great collection of metal music accompanied by scary ghost stories better than you could possibly tell around the campfire. If you don't have these disks in your collection, I would recommend this set.<br /><br />My one complaint is the lack of printed material in the collection. All that is provided are simple sleeves. I mean come on...at least give an insert with lyrics or some photos or something.<br /><br />Oh and BTW...the greatness did not stop with these 5 albums. There was a drop off through the 90's but you should check out &#34;The Puppet Master,&#34; and &#34;Give Me Your Soul...Please.&#34; They are honestly masterpieces of the macabre.

B00ET7EON4|5.0|Arctic Monkeys' &#34;progression&#34; - from whatever-it-is that they were when they first started playing together until now - takes a giant leap in the right direction with this album.  This &#34;darker&#34; sound, a sound that began with their &#34;Humbug&#34; record, has grown with mixed results over the past 4 years or so.  Critics and listeners have criticized this band for trying to sound too much like other bands, most notably Queens of the Stone Age (the leader of whom actually produced &#34;Humbug&#34; and is featured on &#34;AM&#34;), and I would have to agree that at times they were guilty of this.  But with &#34;AM&#34;, Arctic Monkeys have finally produced a sound that is unique to them, and after this record, I believe most criticisms of this band trying to &#34;rip off&#34; other artists will cease.  If anything, I can see bands in the future trying to emulate THIS sound.  Another good part of this record: while they make giant leaps forward in terms of sound, the actual themes of songs that made them famous with their first few records (nights out of the town, unrequited love, heartache, getting very very high) return with a vengeance.  Critics are already panning this &#34;album of the decade&#34; just a week after its release.  A little premature, to be certain, but this is WELL WORTH whatever low price you can find on Amazon.

B008IJT0CE|5.0|I WISH there were a way to adjust sounds volume other than turning it off and back on again. I look forward to seeing what new sounds they add.  Would love more old music box tunes.

B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book was very good.  I liked each character very much and I thought they were all likable and kind.<br />As a veterinarian, I struggle with the sort of decision that the book revolved around.  Perhaps this is why Will and his thoughts and decisions touched me so deeply.  I appreciated the different sides shown to such a heartbreaking issue, and I found the different attitudes and reactions shown to be fascinating.

B008ZDC7M8|4.0|The Story of Film is a great piece of work and a must-see for all true film buffs.  But, as has been pointed out in practically every comment/review, the narration is really awful.  Mr. Cousins sounds like one of the Beatles, ending every phrase on an up note, as if asking a question rather than making a point (fine in Liverpool, tiresome in Louisville).  He has obviously put his heart and soul into this, and, as is usually case when doing something by one's self, on probably a shoe string, sooner or later a corner or two must by cut.  But the presentation is the last place to do it.  What good is the work if the audience is too turned off to wade through it?  He should have hired Dilly Barlow (since James Mason and Alexander Scourby are dead) to do the honors.  She can make anything sound spooky and mysterious and INTERESTING!  Since this will hopefully be around for a long time, I recommend he get a competent narrator to redo it immediately . . .
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Love the series.  Very suspensful, keeps you coming back to watch more.  Can't wait for the next season.  Love it.

I couldn't put it into any prescribed genre but soon I couldn't care less if I couldn't classify it.  Maybe a honest to goodness epic read shouldn't be easily defined. Loved it!
B001DHXT6G|5.0|For years I hesitated about buying this item. The reviews were generally good but the bad ones kept me from buying. The prior bad reviews focused on the poor packaging and the fact that the first season is two sided with an obsolete format on one side.<br />  Then last week it went on sale for under $70.  That was a price I could not resist.<br />  Based on the bad reviews I was expecting flimsy packaging that would be difficult to handle and would not last long, and that the disks were in individual paper sleeves. I was very pleasantly surprised to find these bad reviews were wrong.  Could the packaging have been better. Yes. Is it bad, no. Each season's container stands with stability on its' own.  It protects the DVDs. The disks are NOT in individual paper sleeves. They are in a hinged plastic holder similar to other multi- disk sets I own. This is housed in what I consider a sturdy cardboard receptacle that is in turn housed in larger hinged box that is shown in the item description.<br />  Contrary to the bad reviws the packaging is does the job nicely. Although as I said at the beginning the packing could be better, I have no complaints.<br />  I like the remastering and SF upgrades a lot.<br />  I wish reviewers would focus on the product itself rather than superfluous irrelevancies, unless such are truly bad enough to mention. Now that I have this product I realize that the bad reviews that talked about the packaging were apparently written by people who are nearly impossible to please or just like to complain.  I now wish I had ignored those reviews and purchased this product years ago.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I really love this app.  The free puzzles are great,  and it gives you the option of difficulty for each one.  I would give it 5 stars except for the fact that it keeps stopping for some reason.  Sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t  save your progress,  but most of the time it does.  Fix this problem and it gets 5 stars from me.
B00BMEF6IO|5.0|I'm not a huge fan of the whole \\"death core\\" genre, but this album steps out on a limb that others in this very stale genre aren't willing to step out on. The lyrics are wonderful and deal with very controverial subject matter, not just girls and broken hearts like so many other bands. THIS ALBUM IS PURE HEAVY METAL and it is genre defying. The riffs are heavy, the melody and atmospherics are beautifully arranged, and these musicians play the crap out of their instruments on this album. I myself am a songwriter and I usually don't care for the woe is me, my girl left me lyrics which populate alot of todays metal but this album is different. These guys go deep into some dark subject matter dealing with religion and Hell and their views of organized religion. I admire this band's willingness to make the album they wanted to make and say what they wanted to say. They are no longer just a death core band anymore, they are officially a genre spanning heavy metal band and this album is wonderful

1936719118|5.0|Derek Sivers is the ultimate Spiritual Entrepreneur. After starting the highly successful music distribution site, CD Baby, he sold it without extreme financial gain and then moved on to writing and speaking about the topics of this book. Can a company be successful and still have a conscious? Sivers explains how. Some of the advice is obvious, some is profound. Definitely a quick and fulfilling read for D.I.Y. types of all backgrounds and persuasions. I highly recommend this book!

0393343405|5.0|I read this book several months ago and I knew I had to say something here in a review. I read it in Spanish in a very good translation and I guess I could enjoy part of the highly effective Greenblatt's style. In fact, the book is so well written that you can distinguish the author dexterity in both selecting single words for a sentence and designing the entire framework of the work.<br /><br />Now well, \\"The Swerve\\" is exactly as the title suggests a tale about the path that the world followed to become a modern one. In brief it is the story of a manuscript that was found on the fifteen century by an Italian humanist named Poggio Braccolini. The manuscript corresponds to Lucretius's \\"On the Nature of Things\\" (\\"De Rerum Natura\\").<br /><br />I read the poem several years ago without knowing the history behind the book. It could have been lost and nobody would have remembered it or it could have been lost \\"and\\" remembered but never read it anyway. In this case we were fortunate enough not only for the finding itself but also for several other situations that Greenbblatt explains and illustrates. So the author, as Virgil, take your hand and walk down the road with you.<br /><br />Thus, the structure of the book begins with the characters of the story punctuated by the texture of the epoch (the Renaissance in Europe). Here you have the chance of visiting the world of the Catholic Church, The Popes, the scholars, and so on, all of them mixed in a very exciting and dangerous society, full of doubt and dogma.<br /><br />This part of the book, being interesting and --again-- illustrative, is only surpassed by the elegant and stimulating chapter ten (\\"Swerves\\"). In this penultimate chapter you understand the whole message contained in the work. Here is where you get the very reason of talking about a twist, a tipping point, a gyre.<br /><br />I recommend the book because of his intrinsic beauty and the originality that penetrates an old story (something is missing and suddenly found out). Do not forget either \\"On the Nature of Things.\\" I hope it will be your next reading.nly found out). Do not forget either \\"On the Nature of Things.\\" I hope it will be your next reading.

B0060D15AK|5.0|really enjoyed this including the schmaltzy ending!  It was somewhat predictable, and unrealistic, but come on that's the fun of it!
B007704PRU|5.0|What a great ending to a Trilogy it was everything I wanted it to be and more. What smart writing using a then and now concept and moving from one character to another.  I wondered who was the one who busted Lena and Alex that night of escape at 37 brooks. Well done Lauren. Love it!
B007THA4FI|1.0|I don't even want to give it one star!  It is awful.  I struggled through 50 pages and cannot go on!  Too many characters to follow. I want my money back.
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|I have never seen this band live, but based on the album sound they must be a good live band.<br />I like the sound of the combined Tedeschi Trucks band quite a bit better than the Trucks band. Susan's voice really adds an important dimension and depth to the recordings. I wish Saunders Sermons got a bit more mic time, but he's in there. You just have to listen.<br />Favorite track: Part of Me.
6305428042|5.0|I love this movie. If you like Halloween comedies and this is one for you. Great cast and story line as well as songs in this movie.

B000087F6M|3.0|Director Ivan Reitman's LEGAL EAGLES (1986) stars Robert Redford, Debra Winger and Daryl Hannah and features Brian Dennehy, Terence Stamp, Stephen Hill, John McMartin and Roscoe Lee Browne.<br /><br />Here, Redford is an asst. DA, Winger a defense attorney who work together to solve a possible murder that occurred 18 years earlier. At that time an arson fire killed a painter and destroyed most of his work. In the present, the dead man's daughter (Hannah) steals a painting she claims was a 10th birthday gift from her dad.<br /><br />The two lawyers' investigation reveals that more than a single artwork may have survived the long ago fire and that gallery owner Stamp may somehow be involved. Dennehy is a NYC detective who worked the original case. He provides Winger and Redford some stolen evidence that puts them on Stamp's track.<br /><br />After Redford falls into bed with eccentric performance artist Hannah, the police burst in and arrest her for Stamp's murder. Of course she denies committing the crime. The story of a DA and accused killer cozying together make for lurid headlines. Redford quits the attorneys' office before he's fired, and he officially (if reluctantly) joins Winger as co-counsel on Hannah's case. Browne is the presiding judge.<br /><br />Outside the courtroom the film turns into a thriller, with Winger and Hannah searching the shadowy upper floors of Stamp's gallery for the missing painting and Redford, who appears just in time, grappling with the real killer after he immobilzes the two women and sets a covering fire. Their stuggle is brief, a flaw perhaps, but necessary with the blaze grown to an inferno.<br /><br />The ending of this picture underwent a few changes after review audiences gave it a so-so grade.<br />Based on a somewhat confusing story and lack of chemistry between the two leads, a tepid 5.7 rating at IMDb seems about right.

B000I3UAJ0|1.0|The whole gang is reunited at last! Kirk resumes command of the enterprise and re-conscripts Spock & Bones to do battle against the giant sphincter in the sky before it has a chance to destroy the Earth. They must first endure a gaseous cloud, which nearly depletes their shields before propelling Spock up the anus in a quest to find the cause of indigestion. An ancient turd is discovered to the be the cause of the discomfort and the crew must convince their powerful foe to adopt a healthier diet. The suggested, gluten free diet, only serves to provokes Earth's unwelcome guest. Finally, the ships only fruititarian is sacrificed because he is believed to have a composition high in fiber which may help to dislodge the offending turd. The plan works, Earth is spewed with debris during the ensuing upheaval but is otherwise undamaged.
B0084IHVC0|4.0|Disney Studios 20th full length animated feature film from the Disney studios. The Aristocats is a decent entry into the Disney animated film cannon with some memorable characters, but the new Xerography process while being a cost saving achievement did not make these newer films better in my opinion, in fact they just don't have the Disney luster we've all become accustomed to.<br /><br />While this isn't Disney at it's best it is enjoyable. The animation process has been fleshed out more and the new process isn't as jarring as it seemed in Sword and the Stone but not quite as polished as it is in Jungle Book. The artwork is beautiful in the film, but it is a totally different style. The rougher lines on the drawings being exposed just comes across like their unpolished. This process worked well with this film, Jungle Book, Winnie the Pooh and 101 Dalmatians though, but after ending the traditional process with the fabulous looking Sleeping Beauty, (yes one scene used this process.. a sort of trial) these films looks very 2 dimensional and just don't seem to have the same magical look to them.<br /><br />OK, now about the film and video releases. I have owned both DVD releases and the new Blu Ray and all have their good points and bad points. the first release was released in full screen and the second in 1:75:1 and the new Blu Ray is 1:66:1 which seems to work well as the film doesn't appeared cramped. It would be nice if Disney would include multiple formats on the newer releases as the extras are thin and there is room for them. It would also let buyer have more options for playback. The restoration looks impressive, but because of the style of animation and the Xerography process the rough lines seem a little too rough for my taste in come areas. I prefer the earlier films over the films from 1961-1981. These films seem to be missing some of Walt's magic.<br /><br />If you must own The Aristocats, then the Blu Ray is the way to go
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|Lots of differences from the movie. The book was good, but no where near spellbinding. Let's see how the next one goes.

B00BWBHIUG|4.0|It's a cute little game/time passer in which you help Nemo build a reef for himself and his friends to live. The more you build, the more of Nemo's buddies show up. It kind of reminds me a little of the &#34;smurfs&#34; app for android ... like the smurfs it will try to get you to buy (with real money) add on items that help you build the reef better and faster. Still, all in all, kind of a relaxing little app and the characters are cute especially for my 7 and 9 year old, who play the game on my phone when we're waiting in line, etc.

B0043WDK2G|5.0|Enjoy watching this Season for the ongoing flirtation between Kate Beckett and Richard Castle. As much as I admire the lead characters, I also enjoy the entire cast. In my opinion, this is some of the best acting to be found on TV.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I saw the show first so technically I new what to expect already but still there were some surprises that I didn't know were going to happen due to the absence in the show.  This book is were the show and the book start to diverge much more.  The first book and the first season of the HBO show I would say were about 90% alike.  In this book however, events unfold quite differently.  Not so slight as they were in room A of the castle in the book but in the show they were in Room B.  More like Character A fights in a battle in the book and in the show character A does not fight, or Character B plays an eventful roll in the book but is only mentioned in the show.  And since these events did not take place in the show other evens later on can not take place so different scenes are created for the show to convey the events of the book.  I am curious to see how much this divergence will change the show as the seasons progress.  Overall I liked this book and plan on getting the third one soon.
B009GEDP26|5.0|Castle is my favorite show because it has it all--drama, suspense, romance, intrigue, family relationships--the father-daughter chemistry between Richard Castle and Alexis is heart-warming. The mother-son relationship between Castle and Martha--fun, realistic. I adore Nathan Fillion's portrayal of Richard Castle as well as Stana Katic's portrayal of Kate Beckett...and I love them together! The chemistry between them is awesome. Really can't get enough of this show and so looking forward to Season 6!

B00BTJMS1A|5.0|This game is a lot of fun for how simple it is.  Dont let the graphics fool you.  The closest game I have played to it was &#34;Henry Hatsworth in the Puzzling Adventure&#34; for the Nintendo DS.  This game had less platforming but was very good.  I highly recommend the Devs try to add some platforming or ability to store up attacks you created when no enemies are near so you can unleash a heavy blow to stronger enemies. Lots of fun.

B004D2A04M|3.0|Another reviewer mentioned that the clip is too deep and I would agree.  It's better suited to a 2\\" - 2-1/2\\" belt than to the 1-1/2\\" belt I wear.  On my belt it flops around, spins, and because I wear it in the front, digs uncomfortably into my leg when I crouch.  Similar, all-plastic Nite-Ize clips don't do any of these things, but then, they don't make a light pouch this small, either.  The pivot does spin quite freely and I imagine this might worsen with age, but it's held my flashlight so far.  Just wish the clip were better.

B001NVIZ9I|5.0|I have seen all of the Robin Hood movies including the Douglas Fairbanks version.  ! was 10 years old when this version was released.  I was given the book by Sara Hawks Sterling for Christmas 1938.  I could read books by the time I was ten.  I have a six foot long yew long bow with a draw weight of 50 pounds made by Bitzenberger in Los Angeles in 1942.  I paid $20 for it second hand in 1943 when I was working for 50 cents an hour.  I sort of liked the Patrick Bergen, Uma Thurman version but the Errol Flynn, was and still is the definitive Robin Hood.  Much appreciated was the short by Howard Hill, the individual who was responsible for turning archery into a major American sport and was the first to kill an elephant with a bow and arrow.  Although he wouldn't do it today.  Although poachers still kill them for ivory

B003WUYOQ6|4.0|I had been thinking that the food pyramid which was introduced by the United States Department of Agriculture in the year 1992, and was updated in 2005, and then replaced in 2011 (pyramid with grains on the bottom, meaning the basis of your diet) just wasn't right.  I didn't know why until after reading this book.  What Gary Taubes presents, with science to back it up, makes sense.  It makes you think about what you've been taught and you may have to change your paradigm, but it is worth a try, though it may mean you need to empty your pantry of items you used to think were good for you.

0800141806|5.0|The plot is simple and the meaning is just as simple. But the film is not interesting so much because of this plot, but because of the high level of human contradictions and inhuman bigotry invested in every sequence of it.<br /><br />A young brilliant and promising lawyer gets recruited by one important law firm in Philadelphia and within some years he is entrusted with one of the most important cases they have ever had in their hands. But within a few weeks he is purely and simply fired for incompetence. The logic of this extremely fast career and the swiftness with which it is broken is of course suspicious. The lawyer is gay and has aids.<br /><br />The lawyer goes to court and all the lawyers he contacts to represent him refuse, including a friend of his, his tenth and last chance. But that's how America was in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Afraid and fundamentally hostile to gay people in the name of anything that could justify their bigotry, and first of all their reading of the Bible.<br /><br />The tenth lawyer finally accepts to represent him because of the Federal Vocational Rehabilitation Act of 1973 that prevents any kind of discrimination for any kind of handicap, provided the work required is done properly. They find some jurisprudence and one antecedent case in which a court accepted to consider AIDS as being such a physical condition that could be considered as a handicap and thus any hostile attitude or any attitude that will not treat such a person as any other is discrimination.<br /><br />The plot is simple, I said, and the case is won with a hefty amount of damages, about 5 millions.<br /><br />The film is very strong because the lawyer will have a final seizure in court and the trial will go on and come to an end in his absence. The sentence will be pronounced, him being still alive in hospital. They all, his family, his lawyer and some friends, convened in his room to celebrate the sentence but he will not survive this evening and will die in the night in the sole presence of his partner. The court decision will not be appealed because you cannot introduce a legal suit against a dead person. The trial became history and jurisprudence, common law as some call it.<br /><br />The acting is of course essential and it is true at times the situations and the hatred of homophobic people make that acting iffy in many ways, skating on the thin ice of the civil war some would like to start to exterminate these agents of the devil gay people are accused of being. But the judge himself, at the end of the trial, when the boss of the law firm is testifying, seems to be becoming less tolerant with their antics and forces that boss to answer some very embarrassing questions, embarrassing for the law firm of course, like the treatment this lawyer and ten of his ship mates when he was in the navy submitted one gay sailor to. Too gross to even quote the script.<br /><br />This film also made history because of its Best Actor Oscar. Public opinion in the USA started to turn in that period after the strict rejection of AIDS as the gay plague and hence, like all plagues since even before Moses, the punishment of God against sin, in this case against homosexuals. But starting only because in 1996 Bill Clinton managed to get the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) passed in Congress. One of the most vicious and pernicious laws against gay people.<br /><br />And only twenty years later (DOMA) was finally ruled unconstitutional at federal level by the US Supreme Court. Twenty long years of legal segregation at federal level. And only thirteen states so far have legalized gay marriage. The road is still long, even if thirteen states are enough to block any possible amendment to the US constitution that requires thirty-eight states to be ratified.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUin the night in the sole presence of his partner. The court decision will not be appealed because you cannot introduce a legal suit against a dead person. The trial became history and jurisprudence, common law as some call it.<br /><br />The acting is of course essential and it is true at times the situations and the hatred of homophobic people make that acting iffy in many ways, skating on the thin ice of the civil war some would like to start to exterminate these agents of the devil gay people are accused of being. But the judge himself, at the end of the trial, when the boss of the law firm is testifying, seems to be becoming less tolerant with their antics and forces that boss to answer some very embarrassing questions, embarrassing for the law firm of course, like the treatment this lawyer and ten of his ship mates when he was in the navy submitted one gay sailor to. Too gross to even quote the script.<br /><br />This film also made history because of its Best Actor Oscar. Public opinion in the USA started to turn in that period after the strict rejection of AIDS as the gay plague and hence, like all plagues since even before Moses, the punishment of God against sin, in this case against homosexuals. But starting only because in 1996 Bill Clinton managed to get the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) passed in Congress. One of the most vicious and pernicious laws against gay people.<br /><br />And only twenty years later (DOMA) was finally ruled unconstitutional at federal level by the US Supreme Court. Twenty long years of legal segregation at federal level. And only thirteen states so far have legalized gay marriage. The road is still long, even if thirteen states are enough to block any possible amendment to the US constitution that requires thirty-eight states to be ratified.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU

B008JFUO36|4.0|This film is a fairy tale and I guarantee you it will end well. But it is also a patchwork of plagiarized elements.<br /><br />The earth was destroyed, a destruction caused by the destruction of the moon by some not really specified cosmic war. The earth then turned into a wasteland submerged by tons and tons of dust, earth and rocks. The ruins are thus underground. The Golden Gate Bridge is reduced to two pillar tips sticking out of that dirt. That's a rewriting of H.G. Wells the Time Machine.<br /><br />Two humans are living in the ring of satellites that overlook the waste land with a company of drones that are supposed to destroy all signs of life. Jack Harper is the man and the woman is supposed to be his wife. Jack Harper's memory has been erased to enable him to carry out his mission. Total Recall, second episode, the sequel. Everyday Jack Harper is supposed to go down on the surface to revive the drones that have been downed in the night. There is thus some kind of hostile life on this planet, living underground of course. That's Star Wars revisited. An underground resistance has been so often used that listing all the plagiarized connections would take many pages. That implies at this moment that the surviving humans who have fled the decaying planet are controlling the situation from some distant artificial planet. That is a black star like in Star Wars again. But who are these escapees?<br /><br />But memory-deprived Jack Harper knows where there is a secret valley that is as primeval as the Garden of Eden. There Jack Harper has a cabin with electricity and a pile of vinyl records and a record player and all kinds of heirloom  and he plays his records everyday when he manages to escape from the control of his \\"wife\\" on the surveillance satellite. The drones have never found that place. I guess Jack Harper's lost memory was not lost completely and the drones are not very swift.<br /><br />Then one day a spacecraft crushes on the surface and there are four or five sleep-boxes with hibernating human beings in them. This spacecraft was called by a strange signal from the underground resistance. The drones are destroying the sleep-pods. Jack Harper saves one and takes the woman inside to his satellite base. The reaction of his official wife shows there is a real problem there. When he takes the woman to recuperate the \\"black box\\" of the space craft they are captured by the resistance and then things become iffy.<br /><br />Let's have one more trip \\"Back to the Future\\" and then we have two Jack Harpers and maybe or maybe not two women and this saved woman (or her and her double) is revealed to be Jack Harper's real wife, two real wives and two real Jack Harpers. Then the initial Jack Harper recuperates some kind of memory. With the help of the resistance under attack from drones, he realizes that he has to fulfill the mission the other Jack Harper - but that is him in a way, at least if you accept the concept of doppelgangers - and  his wife were entrusted with: to destroy the black star.<br /><br />Officially one of his real wives is hidden in the secret valley, the other one is set in the sleep pod that is going to be delivered by one Jack Harper to the black star with a bomb in it. When he finally reaches his destination, o divine miracle, the wife has been swapped and replaced by the leader of the resistance who is dying of a wound gotten in the last battle against the drones. But the bomb is here, Jack Harper is determined and the final an massive attack of drones against the resistance is under way.<br /><br />What will happen? A happy happening and glorious ending of course. The black star crumbles, the drones are grounded, the resistance is saved, the wife has a child and two or three years later the surviving Jack Harper reaches the secret valley with the resistance and we are in a Grimm-like ending when they are happy ever after, ever after Snow White's step mother dies dancing in red-hot metal shoes.<br /><br />If you like soft horror fairy tales, rush to this one. Otherwise entrust it to your children who might have soft nightmares in the night. You will have to cuddle them with love.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU>If you like soft horror fairy tales, rush to this one.

B00CWIMVDW|4.0|A surprising series. It is always difficult to produce a prequel - The prequel of Dune written by Brian Herbert, with the help of Kevin J. Anderson, is for example far from what his father Frank Herbert produced - since we know Doctor Hannibal Lecter is in prison at the beginning of The Silence of the Lambs. In the prequel we have the story of a criminal who is going to be caught. We can see his style, how he manipulates people in order for them to appear as being the criminals while he is nicely going on with his crimes and cleaning up around him all those who may have a suspicion.<br /><br />He is a perverse cook and he cooks for anyone, friends and fiends, police and civilians, patients and strangers, fancy dishes and even banquets. The only thing they do not know is that all the dishes served to them are based on human organs and flesh. He kills to get the organs or parts he wants, or is needs? All the guests to his table are thus turned into cannibals though they don't know it. He even turns some bodies into the growing soil of some of his mushrooms or vegetables.<br /><br />The series is clear about his great power to manipulate people and make them commit the crimes he wants them to commit, or assume the crimes he has committed and he wants to cover up with a fake culprit. He only kills those menacing his activities himself if he can't do otherwise. In this season he aims at getting the FBI special agent who has psychic powers because his psychic powers could easily reveal his true identity, not as a helpful psychiatrist but as a resourceful murderer, and because he is easily manipulated since he can easily be brought to the point when he does not know where the divide between reality and psychic vision or nightmarish dream is.<br /><br />Apart from that the only other interest is that some of these crimes are highly creative and committed by other criminals that in a way or another he uses to create an ambiance, an atmosphere of fear and suspicion. The culinary expertise is really nothing but a prop in this plot. The cruelty of this man is just what we expect but the cruelest crimes are not committed by him. Then the series becomes a vision into what perversions our society can create or rather give free rein to in order for them to find an outlet, Hannibal Lecter being only one of these criminals who can stand over this mess to pull the strings and produce the smoke screen he needs, a smoke screen that has a nice aroma, a nice fumet, a nice edible fragrance that titillates our appetite if not gluttony.<br /><br />And we forget glittony is a deadly sin so that we can accept the guilt of anyone around us, even our best friends, provided the food goes on running down the table to our china plates and silver platters. The end of the season is a perfect suspenseful situation in which special Agent Will Graham has found refuge in Hannibal Lecter's office after he escaped from prison by killing a few people who were supposed to transfer him to some high security prison for a whole series of crime he did not commit but Hannibal Lecter has manipulated the FBI and Will Graham himself into believing they have been committed by Bill Graham, by himself as for Bill Graham.<br /><br />Gruesome, bleak and probably over-realistic, but crime has no limits and the divide between sanity and derangement is so invisible that we could all be main suspects in the hard fate of our neighbors.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUary expertise is really nothing but a prop in this plot.

B005GFPZYK|4.0|Like most people, I tend to read multiple books in one genre before I move on to something else. This book was number three in the nonfiction elite warfighter phase. I wouldn't say that it was my favorite, but I would say that anyone interested in what's really going on with our service men and women in the middle east should read this book. Chris Kyle wasn't worried about telling the truth and getting in trouble.<br /><br />He is a true hero, and will be missed.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|The two seasons are simple as for the divide between the two. The first season is the rise of Caesar from the conquest of Gaul to the consulship in Rome against the will of the nobles and patricians of the republic who wanted him eliminated from politics. Then he gets into the game, conquers Rome itself, the Senate and becomes the first autocratic ruler, hence the first emperor or a preview of what it was going to be. He had to defeat Pompey, the leader of the Senate who fled to Greece.<br /><br />But he is assassinated by many patrician senators in the senate, the fatal and last blow coming from Brutus, the one he had defined as his trusted friend and spiritual son. Yet he must have known there was something wrong in that Brutus, especially when he refused to accept the governorship of Macedonia not to be sent away from Rome, since in his will he made Gaius Octavian, a nephew of his, his legal and sole heir.<br /><br />The second season is the rise of the adoptive son of Caesar, his nephew Gaius Octavian, the future Emperor Augustus. This young man helps Mark Anthony, the surviving associate of Caesar, to negotiate the status quo and a general amnesty with the leader of the Senate Cicero and the patricians there. This compromise keeps Mark Antony in his position as consul, but Gaius Octavian manipulates the patricians and this leads to the sending of Brutus away from Rome, and later on with the downgrading of Mark Antony who has to escape with his own, legions north. Gaius Octavian then negotiates an alliance with Mark Antony against Brutus who is announced as marching on Rome. Brutus is defeated and Mark Antony will have to accept his exile to Egypt and Cleopatra, which will mean his end, defeated by Gaius Octavian, in fact defeated by his orgiastic love affair.<br /><br />Note the two seasons correspond to Shakespeare's Julius Caesar and Anthony and Cleopatra.<br /><br />The republic of Rome is finally dead and the Empire has taken over with one sole leader.<br /><br />The history behind the series is rather simple. But what is original is of course the tremendous art displayed in the series to depict Rome at the time realistically.<br /><br />First, we enter the family businesses and strives of these patricians who will bring the republic down and instate the empire just because of their personal ambitions and hostilities cannot find any peace and coexistence. At times the series is gross by realistically showing how women in this world are playing the plotting game better than any one else, among themselves, against one another or against men.<br /><br />Second this is a slave state and slavery is everywhere. A free man or woman can kill a slave at will, if it is his or hers, and only with some financial consequences if it is someone else's: a sort of compensation for the loss of property, damages for the property damage. It is also shown how a personal slave is supposed to follow his or her master or mistress in death when death comes: the slave very often will help his or her master or mistress to die when time has come, and then will kill herself or himself on the dead body, otherwise he or she will be killed by the first intervening official, and surely in some refined torture. We are given one example of the torturing of a slave that is conducted by the woman this slave was supposed to kill, and he failed, and he will only be put to death out of his misery when he will have told the name of the woman who paid him to do it.<br /><br />We often forget that the majority of the working population was composed of slaves, to the point of causing some problems with the free laborers of Rome who were unemployed or under-employed, which means  they had problem just plainly surviving because of this \\"unfair\\" competition.<br /><br />Third the series insists on the sexual dimension of this society. Sex was part of this world and was always more or less public: less when only slaves could witness it; more when sex was performed in front of everyone in any occasion, in an orgy, in a brothel, or plainly in the street or at home at times in some celebration. The question of orientation is not over emphasized, I mean gay sex, though there are a few cases to make it clear that orientation was not a question that could divide people. Sex was sex. Sex was not love. Sex was exclusively entertaining. And slaves had no right to object against any kind of sexual action with them. Any free man or woman could take any slave sexually in anyway they wanted.<br /><br />Fourth the next element I will emphasize is the extreme violence and the common spill of blood in any action. Fighting to one's death, killing to survive in any kind of public execution when a man was thrown into some arena against trained gladiators was common place. Assassination for a profit or to eliminate a rival or competitor was also part of the Roman game, and that was a game, a bloody social game. Have things changed today? For sure they have but not as much as one could think.<br /><br />Fifth the series insists on the extreme level of superstition and religious bigotry, if not sorcery, at all levels of society. To kill, even in temples, was common place and if human sacrifice was no longer possible per se, though it was more than frequent to throw a criminal of any type, or a slave for any reason whatsoever, into a pit to be dismembered or whatever the whims of the gladiators down there would caress and entertain. Emasculation and rape were common place, both sexes in the case of rape. Capturing your enemies or the family of yours enemies, or the friends of your enemies and selling them as slaves was common place too. The various types of slaves are put on display constantly: personal valets or chambermaids, kitchen slaves, field slaves, but also sex slaves (for personal use), mining slaves (hard labor), prostitution (open and financially profitable slavery), all kinds of productive work from crafts to commerce, and then whatever entertaining activity a slave could be submitted to in an orgy, in a circus, in the street, out of a whim or some perverse desire. Most entertainments had to do with bringing one or several people to their unnatural death in some cruel display. The death of Vercingetorix is one case that is demonstrated in length, and his final execution will be in the Forum as part of the public celebration of Caesar's victory, part of Caesar's triumph. The strangest category of slaves are private counselors for the powerful. This reveals that slavery is in a way a trusted position accepted by the salves as normal fate and exploited by the slave-owner, at times with a lot of trust and even love; Caesar's private counselors was a slave and he was freed in Caesar's will.<br /><br />Sixth the last element is the role the Aventine in Rome, the harbor and wholesale commercial center of Rome for imports essentially (corn particularly). It is in the hands of some independent and mostly violent corporations that have a lot to do with what we would consider today as the mafia. It is an essential stake for the Senate, for the Emperor later. They could block imports and thus famish the city, create an artificial famine. That's probably one of the essential segments of society that made the Roman Empire powerful. These corporations were difficult to govern but extremely powerful in a rather primitive market economy in a metropolis that had no direct surrounding environment that could sustain its economy and its population. It had to have an independent and powerful social organization that could guarantee the flow of imports. Octavian was particularly menaced by conflicts among them (both among the corporations themselves and between Octavian and the corporations) that brought starvation if not famine.<br /><br />For all these reasons this series should be a favorite of people who like realistic non-cosmeticized history.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUn front of everyone in any occasion, in an orgy, in a brothel, or plainly in the street or at home at times in some celebration.

B004UPANAI|3.0|If you're a fan of Wolverine and you expected to see the actual story of his origins, go back to the graphic novels. You won't get an accurate portrayal in this movie. They literally rewrote everything, but that is what we have come to expect from the X-Men movie franchise, isn't it? On the other hand, as a movie that stands apart from the Wolverine we know and love, it's not a bad movie. Try to forget everything you know about each and every character depicted in the movie and just enjoy it as is.

0399159347|5.0|I'm actually sorry that I am almost finished with this book...only have one more chapter left and I made myself stop reading it so I could still have that little bit to look forward to later.  This was one of the best reads I have had in a long while...it was a little confusing at the beginning with the different story lines but the stories all tie in together rather quickly, so it is much easier to follow a few chapters in.  I liked all the characters...even the ones that are \\"supposed\\" to be not so like-able.  This is the first book that I have read by this author and I definitely recommend it...I will be looking for her other titles!  Amazing, engrossing, and awesome read!

I'm a little annoyed you cannot buy the standard version in the US which means that you are buying Halycon again just for 10 new songs. I really hate it when record companies do this.

034547581X|5.0|We Were Soldiers Once... And Young, Ia Drang - The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam by Lieutenant General (LTG) Ret. Harold G. Moore and Joseph L. Galloway is an account like no other.  It is neither the story of one soldiers trials and hardships nor is it a story of glory and triumph. We were soldiers is about leadership, both good and bad. It is about the soldiers who fought and died together and who bleed for one another. It encompasses the horrors, the sacrifice, and the tears of war. We Were Soldiers depicts the courage, the heroism, the mistakes, and the lessons learned by both the US and North Vietnamese. The purpose of this book is to detail part of the thirty-four-day campaign in the Ia Drang Valley of the Central Highlands of South Vietnam in November 1965. This was a time, as the authors put it, \\"when we were young and confident and patriotic and our countrymen knew little and cared less about our sacrifices.\\"<br />The authors hold good merit in writing this book as they were both part of the battle. Galloway was a journalist on the ground and Moore was in command of the 1st Squadron, 7th Cavalry. Together the authors compiled, using firsthand accounts on both sides, an accurate minute-by-minute account of the battles.<br />This book is in 4 distinguishable parts; Before the battles, the fight on Landing Zone X-Ray, the fight on Landing Zone Albany, and the after the battles. The first section, which I distinguish as before the battles, brings light to a lot of the problems in Washington that were going to affect not only the number of soldiers they had on the ground but the quality of those soldiers.  For example, President Johnson refused to declare a state of emergency. This caused a lot of the 7th Cavalry to lose a lot of its experienced soldiers right before their departure to Vietnam. What was so crucial about this was the 7th Cavalry had been training for months on air assault missions, which at the time was a brand new tactic. The drafted soldiers that replaced them had very little time to train and lacked the combat experience of the soldiers they replaced.<br />In both the fight on Landing Zone X-Ray and the fight on Landing Zone Albany, Moore and Galloway reach the reader in a very emotional way. Through firsthand accounts the authors tell you not only who did what but who the soldiers really were, where they were from, and how they interacted with the other soldiers. For example, just about every time a new person was introduced it would go something like this: \\"The 2nd Platoon Leader was John Geoghegan, a handsome, red-haired young officer, commissioned out of the Pennsylvania Military College, who was four days past his twenty-fourth birthday.\\" This is a very personal touch by the authors that brings you closer to the story and allows you to visualize each character.<br />The fourth and final section, which I title after the battles, looks at, for lack of a better term, the aftermath of the war. To do this, top-secret memos, written by Sec. McNamara were used to depict how little confidence administration had in an actual victory. It is stated that \\"[McNamara] now knew that the Vietnam War had just exploded into an open-ended and massive commitment of American men, money, and materiel to a cause that he was beginning to suspect would be difficult to win.\\" In addition an entire chapter is dedicated to the loved ones and spouses of the soldiers that died. It dives into the struggles and challenges they faced when they got that dreaded telegram.<br />Overall this is a great book that anyone should read. It is an accurate account that puts you in touch with who the soldiers were. Without a military background the book can be hard to read at times. It uses military jargon and reads like a military report, however this is not a bad thing considering one of the authors spent a career in the military. The battle of Ia Drang was unusual because, unlike the missions in WW2 where you marched across the country pushing the enemy back, the mission here was to find the enemy and attack. When the 7th Cavalry found the enemy in  Landing Zone X-Ray many knew it was going to be a difficult battle.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this informative, eye-opening look at living in a women's prison, albeit a minimum security federal prison in Danbury, CT.<br /><br />The author was involved, in a somewhat minor role, in drug smuggling for a friend, not long after college. Annoyingly, the drug lord who oversaw the drug ring was never prosecuted. One odd thing, something I never realized, was that there was more than 10 years between the crime and the time. She knew she was going to go to prison but they wanted her to testify against the drug lord, but not in an orange prison jumpsuit, so she was outside, working and living.<br /><br />Blonde and cute and young, she entered a guilty plea and was sentenced to 15 months. Not surprisingly, once in prison, she found that many of her fellow inmates had been convicted for similar drug offenses but were serving far more time. It does pay to have high-priced legal help!!<br /><br />I was expecting violence and lesbian attacks and who knows what else but, at least in this minimum security prison, there was none of that. Yes, there are humiliating strip searches but, for the most part, the inmates split up into tribes based on race, did their jobs (the author, a Smith College grad, did electrical work and then carpentry type work), and helped each other.<br /><br />Surprisingly, the women were welcoming and shared what little they had, in terms of possessions and knowledge, with newcomers.<br /><br />The author tended to rant about the drug policy of the U.S. and I thought the book occasionally got bogged down at those points but, for the most part, this was a lively, absolutely fascinating book. Loved it.

B00BOLE7X0|5.0|I don't know what I expected because I read no reviews ahead. But I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was slice out of Lincoln's life, created in an artistic, theatrical fashion. The acting was excellent making the characters of history come to life.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I liked this book. The characters were all interesting and the plot kept me interested. My only complaint is it kind of depressing and sad.

This is not your run of the mill pop. It takes you into the shadow lands, love, death, life and everything in between. I loved it...

B008JFUO4U|5.0|I ordered  this  movie  at the same time  I &#34;pre-ordered&#34;  Star Trek Into  the Darkness.  Oblivion made it  through all the problems in Colorado and was at my door in good order and on time.  Course, this wan not &#34;pre-ordered&#34;.  Maybe that's why.
B003JTHWJQ|3.0|I read the book \\"The God Delusion\\" by Richard Dawkins. Dawkins is a British biologist and well-known atheist. The book was published in 2006 and was supposedly Dawkins' response to the mass murder committed on 9/11 in the name of religion. Dawkins contends that there is no evidence for the existence of God; and, therefore faith in him (or her or it) is delusional. Overall, I enjoyed the book. However, I do have some critical comments and observations.<br /><br />First, in view of his reason for writing the book, I found it ironic that Dawkins had very little to say about Islam. Other than a short attack on blasphemy and apostate laws in Pakistan and Afghanistan in Chapter 8, criticism of the Burkha (while using it as an analogy for something else) and a few other comments here and there, he never really takes direct aim at Islam, as he does with Christianity and Judaism (see examples below). Was this omission an act of \\"self-censorship?\\" Did it have anything to do with his country's colonial past and historical sympathies for the Arab World? Did he wish to avoid offending British Muslims? Did he purposely limit his pointed barbs to the faiths of those he knew wouldn't respond violently?<br /><br />In any event, all three monotheistic faiths should be subjected to critical analysis, not the least of which is one where a 40 something year-old illiterate man receives instructions from an angel to begin reciting verses--which verses are initially memorized by his followers, passed down to others, and eventually placed into a written form that we now call the Koran. And, what about all of the \\"kill commands\\" that appear in the Koran? Dr. Dawkins doesn't hesitate to point out the \\"kill commands\\" appearing in the Bible. Has Dr. Dawkins ever calculated the life expectancy of an atheist residing in a Muslim country? Why the reticence about Islam, Dr. Dawkins?<br /><br />And, since Dr. Dawkins is a man of hard evidence, 9/11 was not carried out in the generic name of religion; rather, it was carried out by 19 members of the Islamic faith, who hijacked four airliners, crashing them into three buildings and a field and murdering almost 3,000 innocent people. They did it in the name of Islam, not in the name of generic religion. These are the hard facts, Dr. Dawkins. You shouldn't point the finger at anyone else.<br /><br />For these omissions, I deducted one star from the rating system.<br /><br />As an example of his criticism of Christianity, Dawkins states that Pope John Paul II created more saints than all of his predecessors combined and that his \\"polytheistic hankerings were dramatically demonstrated in 1981 when he suffered an assassination attempt in Rome, and attributed his survival to intervention by Our Lady of Fatima: 'A maternal hand guided the bullet.' One cannot help wondering why she didn't guide it to miss him altogether. Others might think the team of surgeons who operated on him for six hours deserved at least a share of the credit. . .\\"<br /><br />Another example is the following statement, \\"It is, when you think about it, remarkable that a religion should adopt an instrument of torture and execution as its sacred symbol, often worn around the neck. Lenny Bruce rightly quipped that 'If Jesus had been killed twenty years ago, Catholic school children would be wearing little electric chairs around their necks instead of crosses.'\\"<br /><br />And, his oft-quoted passage at the beginning of Chapter two, is an example of his criticism of Judaism: \\"The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction: jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully.\\"<br /><br />And, as you can see, if you want to improve your English vocabulary, this book is for you! Luckily, I read the Kindle version and was able to look up words with a couple of screen touches. For your information, the word \\"filicidal\\" is the adjective for \\"filicide,\\" meaning the killing of one's own son or daughter.<br /><br />Of course, Dawkins fails to tell the reader that for the past 2,000 years, the stern and angry God of judgment depicted in the Bible has become a loving and caring deity, whose essence is ethical concern and ethical behavior. If humans can evolve, why can't their religions do the same?<br /><br />Moreover, other than for fundamentalists, does the theology of any organized religion, in this modern-day and age, really matter? Doesn't behavior matter more?<br /><br />In his book \\"Kosher Jesus,\\" Rabbi Shmuley Boteach writes, \\"The merit of any religion is established not by a test of its theological claims but by the goodness of its followers. Therefore, any religion that leads to a good and Godly life has authenticity and truth, even if we cannot embrace all of its theological claims.\\"<br /><br />For example, I find Mormon theology to be absurd on its face. Yet, the Mormons that I've met have been nice, respectful and honorable people. I would happily have them as neighbors. Isn't behavior the only thing we should care about? After all, it wasn't two Mormons who planted bombs at the recent Boston Marathon.<br /><br />Dawkins' book shines when he is writing about the Bible and religion. I agree that religion has been opposed to scientific advancement, because science challenges religion's absolutist truths. And, I also agree that we cannot govern ourselves, in this modern day and age, by an absolutist moral system written during the Bronze Age. The teaching of Creationism is best left to parochial schools; whereas, the teaching of Evolution (and other sciences) is best left to Science Class.<br /><br />However, at times, Dawkins' book becomes tedious, ponderous, and textbook-like. This is especially true when he's writing about natural selection, cosmology and science. Iwas bored stiff while reading some portions of the book and wondered if Dawkins was writing for his science colleagues, rather than the general public. Often times, I yearned for him to \\"get to the point already.\\" I much prefer a straight forward, fluid and easy to follow writing style.<br /><br />For this reason, I deducted another star from the rating system.<br /><br />More importantly, I think it's possible to over-analyze things, as Dawkins does. Sometimes the answer is staring you right in the face and you choose to ignore it. For example, why does religion exist and why is it ubiquitous (meaning present everywhere) in most of human culture? Why?<br /><br />Despite the author's discussion of human dualism (the human tendency to separate matter and mind), child teleology (everything has a purpose), his connection of all human traits (such as morality) to a time predating religion, and numerous other things, the answer to the existence of religion and its prevalence in human society (at least for me) is a very simple one: death.<br /><br />Darwin's natural selection depends on survival. Only when a species survives can it reproduce and pass on its genes. The opposite of survival is death. Death is a common denominator for all humans, regardless of geography, time period, culture, occupation, ethnicity, race, religion, gender, age, sexual orientation, socio-economic class (whatever category you choose)--the so called, \\"great equalizer.\\"<br /><br />And, death is something that we humans still do NOT understand. We cannot comprehend our own non-existence. I have heard it said many times before that a person will not die in his or her dreams; and, that before such a thing happens, the dreamer will awaken.<br /><br />Wasn't religion created, albeit in its initial form, when our earliest ancestors (Australopithecus Afarensis or Africanus, or take your pick) saw a neighbor lying dead in a field (either by age, accident, disease, combat or war etc) and came up with an explanation other than non-existence?<br /><br />So, what did we humans do in order to survive, to continue reproducing, and to put off death to the latest possible date? We ascribed death (and its opposite form, life) to a higher force and engaged in prayers, incantations, rituals, and group accepted lifestyles to appease the higher force in keeping us alive and preventing death from visiting too early.<br /><br />And, in order to cope with the death of loved ones, we created an afterlife--where our loved ones are not really considered to be dead; and where they (and eventually, us) are rewarded for obedient and good behavior.<br /><br />This allows the survivors (the ones still presently alive) to continue living and reproducing the species without anger and/or rejection of the higher force that caused or allowed the death to occur in the first place. How many funerals have you been to where a decedent's family member exclaims, \\"he [the decedent] is in a better place.\\" Often times I have thought, \\"if it's a better place, why isn't everyone rushing to get there?\\"<br /><br />Of course, religious fanaticism can have the opposite effect of terminating life earlier than expected; but doing so comes with the \\"martyrdom bonus\\" of certain faiths and the begetting a better afterlife.<br /><br />One subject that Dawkins does not address is the \\"near death experience.\\" For example, neurosurgeon Eben Alexander, M.D., recently wrote about his own near death experience in a book entitled, \\"Proof of Heaven.\\"  Of course, the Alexander book was published after Dawkins' book; but, there have been numerous reports of such experiences and it would have been interesting to read Dawkins' analysis.<br /><br />Is our belief in God irrational? Since there is no evidence to suggest that God actually exists, the answer is an unequivocal yes!<br /><br />On the other hand, is our belief in God rational? Incredibly, the answer to that question is also yes.<br /><br />Since our species' greatestdesire is to survive, to reproduce and to pass on its genes, it is rational for human beings to do whatever they believe is necessary to live, even if those beliefs -- and the actions resulting from those beliefs -- are based on something completely and totally irrational. Obviously, the human trait for irrationality has not been \\"selected out\\" by natural selection.<br /><br />As Francois-Marie Arouet, known to history as Voltaire, said, \\"If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him.\\"<br /><br />And, guess what?<br /><br />We did!

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The casual social media writing style employed by the author brought a unique and relevant viewpoint to this captivating story. I'm sure much conversation was stimulated among readers, the what ifs and what woulds providing the fodder. This was a great read!
B008JFUO4U|4.0|Not what I expected.  Which can be a good thing.  I was very suprised by the story.  If your an action junkie i think you might want to skip this one.  But if you like a balance than this would be a good pick.  Very good director as well (TRON).

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|my kids love this game, they will play it all day if i would let them. I have to say the adults in the family enjoy it as well.
B00E0SX118|5.0|Well, I want to write a review, but I'm afraid you will think I'm a Dreamworks plant, or something.<br /><br />This movie makes me hate watching movies with my kids...for the first 10 run-throughs. The reason? My kids won't stop repeating the lines and laughing and saying, \\"Dad, did you hear that part when he said 'blah blah blah'?\\"<br /><br />This movies has it all. It is funny. It is inventive. It has cave drawings. It has unrefined, crazy, cave-man behavior. It has touching, heart-warming moments. It has action. It has death-defying feats. It has monsters, but interestingly no real villains...except the subtle Earth-Apocalypse hint. It has weird creatures and never-before-seen extinct species. It has politically-correct free/wild pets. It has family dinners, for the old fashioned, but less-than-perfect manners for the non-prude. It has dreams. It has in-laws (great for laughs). It has little side jokes and stories that make kids laugh, but they aren't stupid or simiple, so adults laugh too. (Kind of like Shrek: intelligent humor for adults wrapped in silly stuff for the kids = cha-ching!) I have watched it 3 times now to catch all the quick one-liners that I missed or forgot. You'll never guess how it ends because it never gives away the plot like most movies do. It is very fast paced. There are enough jokes and funny comments to fill 3 movies. You literally can't catch it all and savor the \\"funny\\" in just one viewing.<br /><br />Just good, relaxing fun for all ages. If you like movies, you'll like this one...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|i love this game. it challenges the mind. i love solving puzzles and this is an excellent way to to it. I like the fact you have to escape from the rooms, its fun.
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|It's a heart warming movie showing what one man can do to help change the course of history in the face of death

0307730700|4.0|Fearless about SEAL Team SIX.  A deep story about Adam Brown, a Navy SEAL who fought in Afghanistan.  It is a story about the extremes in the military and how that tied into faith, family and love.  While in the military, not only was there a war against the enemy, there is a war against one's own habits and impulses.  In this story, we see one's drug addiction and perseverance to become a leader, the best of the best.  While combating personal impulses and the enemy, there is a decision that needed to be made, what is the right thing to do?  Is utilitarianism a good ideal to follow?  Should we think of the big picture and forget the ultimate sacrifices?<br /><br />Eric Blehm is a vivid writer about military stories from the recent Afghanistan war after 9/11.  In the beginning of the book, we already find out that the main character, Adam Brown dies.  So, we already know what happens. But the author is able to craft the story in fine words, such that the suspense remains!<br /><br />I received a review copy of this book from the publisher Waterbrook Multnomah.  Check it out!<br /><br />[[ASIN:0307730700 Fearless: The Undaunted Courage and Ultimate Sacrifice of Navy SEAL Team SIX Operator Adam Brown]]

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The most amazing series ever. I became more attached to each character as I watched each season. Incredibly addicting show
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great game for kids and adults that love this kind of arcade game. My 6 year old son and his 78 year old grandmother both play for hours!
B000001IQG|5.0|For me, this is undoubtedly the band's best work. They went from street punks to actual Musicians. The mixture of musical elements is evident throughout the entire album, and you begin to see a band that is in progression of becoming legendary group. &#34;And out come the wolves&#34; is undoubtedly one of punks greatest albums, from any era. Plain and simple, it rocks. See you in the pit!

B007THA4FI|5.0|In &#34;The Casual Vacancy,&#34; J K Rowling demonstrates that she commands the techniques that have given us the great English novels — rich characters, dense social relations that are far too complicated and ambiguous to be called &#34;networks,&#34; well-mounted plotting, and the humor with which to grasp the comedy of English provincial life. But she puts these techniques to a new purpose, upending the complacent, status-quo loving resolution of traditional novels. Astonishingly, Rowling infiltrates the English village novel with a trumpeting cry for social justice. Not to worry, though; &#34;The Casual Vacancy&#34; is a lovely read.
B0085OELXK|4.0|Well done. Excellent portrayal of a psychopath by Matt Damon. Interesting plot twists that had unexpected surprises. But, I would not see it a second time.
B000KIPT30|5.0|I uses the device for a TV that does not have a volume control for the headphone jack.  The device is small and fits perfectly behind my TV. It uses very little power. The box and the transformer that plugs into the outlet are cool to the touch, so I can leave it running.  The sound is as good as it is straight from the TV (stereo).
B002SGYPS2|1.0|Not interesting enough to finish. The story did not seem to be going anywhere that interested me. Typical Hollywood mediocrity.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season is much more bloody in the special effects department. But once again the writers thrill us with phenomenal character growth and a shocking revelation or two. Most programs on TV start out great then sort of dribble away to lack luster. Which always leads to their end. But Walking Dead started out compelling and continues to get more compelling.
0425269205|5.0|A birthday present, my daughter loved it:) it was exactly what she wanted. Thank you for the book thats all
B003MC5N28|4.0|My son had to read this for his 8th grade Language Arts class... so we both read it. It was ok, he actually enjoyed it more than I did!
1439153663|5.0|This book is a heart stopper. I put my life on hold for a couple of days because I could not put it down. I grew up in the time when blacks worked the tobacco and cotton fields in my native North Carolina. There was a simple but complex code, even then, regarding the relationships between whites and their black field and house workers. Grissom has captured this code in white knuckled detail. She brings this period of time to life in haunting 3-D. And what her artistry does, for me, is to make me more determined than ever that no child of God ever again suffer such degradation and horror. I found this book an equally poignant, awakening experience as The Help.
B00BVMXBDO|5.0|Tatiana Maslany is brilliant, amazing, inspiring and just plain awesome! The show works too! Even if Science fiction is not your \\"thing\\" - the writing is smart and funny and clever and fresh! But it is the performances that take this series to the top of the list!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I read this book in one day during a road trip from PA to MI, while my husband was driving. A great story. It made the long drive go by quickly.
B0084B5TK8|3.0|The first couple of  chapters chilled me to the spine.  If you thought you have watched the movies and knew about everything, you have to read this book.  The format of using memoirs and journals is refreshing, but like watching the TV series &#34;24“, it has become not very believable after a while.  The hunting of the creature is exciting enough, but the convergence of the three hunting parties at the same spot towards the end is a bit over the top really.  Anyway, it's really fun reading this.  If you don't have time, just read the first couple of chapters, but then nothing could stop you reading the rest, could they?
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|Cant get enough of this CD and I even went to their concert this week! Infectious and fun! Even if you have never heard them before this CD will make you a T&S fan :)

B00CW7KK9K|5.0|I love that I can see my total steps any time! It also integrates with the Withings scale and BP monitor. I had one syncing issue which was fixed by email from tech support. I only wish you could see history graphs using the phone app, rather than having to go to the website. This was implemented better on the Jawbone UP app.
B0001O3YD0|5.0|I always loved Riddick. The character is an interesting and complex one. Pitch Black is a well done film that not only captures the complexity and mystery of the main character, but sets a good stage to present it. Vin Diesel is underrated in his performance as Riddick. I think both films are well done. If you have not seen The Chronicles of Riddick, I suggest you do. It is a very beautiful film. The cinematography and sets create a surreal landscape.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I am so addicted to this game!!!  I am sure to play daily. Love the mix of slots and Hinton.  I never geg bored.

B00E9PXI3S|2.0|This movie was not what I expected at all.  Not a great film.  I would not recommend it.  The plot line doesn't build much and really isn't worth the time.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|A man awakens and comes to realize he's either suffered a beating or been in a terrible accident. He remembers where he is and why eventually, but, like walking up an incline that's constantly shifting, he's off balance and can never fully right himself.<br />At least a dozen times during my reading of Pines I nearly quit. It's not a relaxing journey and if you get annoyed by being thoroughly confused, you won't make it.<br />What kept me going was the realization that if I was having a weird trip, the main character was going through three kinds of hell and it was fascinating to watch him cope.<br />This is pure action with a hard twist. Ethan is a resilient hero, perhaps a little more Superman than Everyman but likable. I could relate to his struggle to comprehend what the hell was happening to him and why.<br />If you remember the iconic TV series The Prisoner, or even Twin Peaks in 1990, you'll be in familiar territory. Throw in some Planet of the Apes and you'll feel right at home.
B001I45UFC|3.0|Maybe I shouldn’t be too harsh with it. It is well written and I did like it a lot when I was a kid. I just don’t see what I saw in it back then now. If you are a kid or plans to buy it for your kids, go ahead. If you are an adult and wants to read it (again), you probably shouldn’t, as it’s too child-oriented and lacks any real dept that would interest an adult.
B0006AAS5G|1.0|I purchased this model in May of this year, by July it had stopped three times prompting me to return to the place that I purchased the watch from. The battery was changed and the contacts were checked low and behold two months later the watch stopped functioning again and not only that the crown just popped off of the watch. I contacted Invicta and was told that I had to pay for the shipping to have the watch repaired and returned to me after ninety days. NO THANKS! I WILL NEVER EVER PURCHASE ANY WATCH EVER AGAIN FROM INVICTA.

1400069807|5.0|What is bad for you but good for corporations is what gets added to your food.<br />While many books like 'Fast Food Nation', 'In Defence of Food', 'Mindless Eating', 'Supersize Me', 'Food Politics' have all covered several of the topics covered in this book, this book takes a structured approach to the three ingredients themselves that are used to make food more appealing to consumers - salt, sugar, and fat. The breadth of coverage and its depth make this an outstanding book, and one of the best books of the year.<br /><br />What you like is what you will get. In over-abundance. All three in the same packaged food. Designed to feed more cravings for the processed food. The appeals are made to a mother's instincts, to a child's sense of peer self-esteem, to an executive's harried lifestyle. When the criticisms mount, they are either co-opted, or token measures taken to lessen the impact to make these packaged foods only dangerous, down from the alarmingly dangerous.<br /><br />What research worked on, what marketing demanded, was how to inject increasing amounts of salt, sugar, and fat into foods to make them more appealing. So, while sugar had a \\"bliss point\\" after which more sugar content reduced its appeal rather than add, researchers found that \\"there was no bliss point, or break point, for fat.\\" Yes. \\"The fat, no matter how rich the food, was so pleasing to their brains that they never gave the signal to stop eating.\\" So, you could go on adding more and more and more fat to food - like ice-cream, and consumers were unable to tell with precision how much fat had been added. If this is not bad enough, \\"when sugar was added to the fattiest formulation, the students mistakenly thought the fat had been reduced.\\"  These qualities of fat mean that \\"Americans now eat as much as 33 pounds or more of cheese and pseudo-cheese products a year, triple the amount we consumed in the early 1970s.\\"<br /><br />The food industry has lived by a set of rules, one cardinal one for boosting sales being - \\"When in doubt, add sugar.\\"<br /><br />While one may think that the government should be worried about this most devastating impact that processed foods have on the health, and therefore the economic well-being, of its citizenry, it may come as a distressing shock to read that \\"when it comes to the greatest sources of fat - meat and cheese - the Department of Agriculture has joined industry as a full partner in the most urgent mission of all: cajoling the people to eat more.\\"<br /><br />In summary, this book is a depressing though eye-opening read on the manipulations of human temptations to sell more, even at the cost of human health.oosting sales being - \\"When in doubt, add sugar.\\"<br /><br />While one may think that the government should be worried about this most devastating impact that processed foods have on the health, and therefore the economic well-being, of its citizenry, it may come as a distressing shock to read that \\"when it comes to the greatest sources of fat - meat and cheese - the Department of Agriculture has joined industry as a full partner in the most urgent mission of all: cajoling the people to eat more.\\"<br /><br />In summary, this book is a depressing though eye-opening read on the manipulations of human temptations to sell more, even at the cost of human health.

B000FC13Y0|5.0|This is the second book of Neil Gaiman's that I have read and I loved it.  His books are like reading adult fairy tales.  He writes in a style that keeps the story going and is entertaining.  I read every word and didn't want it to end.

B004LWZW42|5.0|This re-boot of a really good comic book movie was done even better than I thought it could.  I know I am in the minority, but I wasn’t sure how they would beat the awesome ending to the third one from the first series.  (Yes, I am one of the few that thought X3 was awesome, best ending around imo)  This one Kevin Bacon plays one of the best bad guy villains and the new cast makes some of the characters better than I thought they were in the comics.  Some of the timeline stuff was strange but I liked it for what it was none the less.  I really liked the idea from the comics of Magneto and Professor X being friends on and off like they are in the comics, this movie gives as good an answer as any of them.

0385743564|3.0|See more of my reviews on Birth of a New Witch!<br /><br />Approximately eighty percent of my friends fall over themselves for Brandon Sanderson, so hearing he had a YA novel coming out about superpowered human beings in Chicago and one group's attempts to fight them piqued my interest. After nearly 400 pages of being immersed in the complex world he built for his superhumans, I can't say I see Sanderson's appeal. His lackluster characters, bad writing, and irritating habits manage to drain the life out of what should be a fun thriller.<br /><br />The worldbuilding, pacing, and plot I most often hear praised about Sanderson's works are here and clear. The classifications David has for Epics take some time to get used to and remember, but the intricate nature of it got me right in the part of my heart I reserve for worldbuilding. Some of its twists surprised me in the best of ways too, though one of them didn't seem to make any sense. Were it not for some major pet peeves Steelheart stomped on, the nonstop action of it all would have kept me reading right up until the last page because it's just. That. Busy. In a good way, of course. We all need a good thriller in our lives every once in a while.<br /><br />What kept me from tearing through it, then? The lackluster characterization, to start. David is the kind of hero who does everything right, knows everything, sees everything happen the way he wants one way or another, and doesn't have any internal (i.e. character flaws) or external obstacles. Some would even call him a Mary Sue/Gary Stu. Whatever he is, he a dull hero with a threadbare personality. He's the best we get too; his love interest Megan and his fellow Reckoners are no more thoroughly characterized.<br /><br />The closest thing David has to a flaw is his habit of making bad metaphors and making fun of them later, but what should be an endearing writing quirk quickly becomes annoying. The other major quirks--a calamitous overuse of childlike fake curses like \\"calamity\\" and \\"sparks\\" alongside people pointing out how little everything makes sense but going with it anyway--are no less irritating and act as major obstacles to the kind of one-sitting reading experience this book should be. There are only so many times I can stand to see someone shout \\"Calamity!\\" in the middle of a bunch of action scenes before a sanity break becomes necessary.<br /><br />I keep hearing his adult fantasy novels are out of this world, so this one bad experience hasn't been enough to remove Sanderson's work from my radar completely. It does give me pause, but he's still going to come up if I ask about adult fantasy reads and all the hype has me curious. All that is certain is that I won't be sticking around for Firefight, book two in the Reckoners series because this book about superhumans isn't quite super enough. (The pun had to be made. It ALWAYS has to be made.)ike \\"calamity\\" and \\"sparks\\" alongside people pointing out how little everything makes sense but going with it anyway--are no less irritating and act as major obstacles to the kind of one-sitting reading experience this book should be.

B00CWY76CC|3.0|I understood the concept but couldn't figure out where to find the tools to complete the puzzles in the room - like a screw driver. Also: hate that you can't turn off the music. And there's no zoom.<br />  I got the Free version to test it out so maybe the paid version fixes some of my issues. So you give it a FREE try and see what you think.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|I love Walking Dead and this was the best value I found for the 3rd season anywhere. I looked at all the major retailers and I was able to buy from Amazon for a minimum of $25 less than other places.
B008GWP2GG|4.0|I saw this was listed as one of the top 50 scariest movies of all time so I had to rent it. Although I do not think this should even be considered a scary movie, it is a good movie.
B004W0OCSK|4.0|Definitely a good one for fans of everything Hitchcock. I have watched this film several times in different venues and even though it is black and white and 4:3 format, the bigger screens seem to do better with the later scenes filmed in the Scottish highlands.
B00ADQPB50|5.0|.......but I just couldn't.<br /><br />I'll admit, I didn't think about watching something like this. I pretty much shunned it after I saw bits and pieces of it. I thought, \\"NO way I'm watching anymore of this.  It looks disgusting.\\"<br /><br />My brother was visiting and he wanted me to DVR the 'Asylum' series. I did, thinking I'll just delete them when he's done with them, but I wasn't going to watch this stuff.  He went to  visit my parents and told me just to watch a couple of episodes just to 'give it a chance'.  I promised I would and decided to go ahead and watch, though I had huge reservations about doing so.  I prepared for the worst show in history.  But......<br /><br />...........Wow!!!  Was I ever thrown for a loop.  While gory, sexual, depraved, sick, twisted and jaw dropping, it was something I couldn't look away from.  I think Joseph Fiennes as Monsignor Timothy Howard made me want to watch even more. Sexy, sexy, sexy.<br /><br />The characters were perfectly cast:<br /><br />Jessica Lange as 'Sister Jude'---I loved watching her battle her own personal demons and her impure thoughts of the Monsignor. \\"You know, Sister, I can't blame you there.\\" She let her past haunt her almost regularly.  Her drinking, smoking and lusty ways. I think she finally got rid of a few demons when she found out she didn't actually kill a certain someone.  She was very strict, even leaning toward sadistic at times, in my opinion.  I think she treated others terribly because she had trouble facing herself.  I'm glad she made peace with herself in the end. 5 stars<br /><br />Lily Rabe as 'Sister Mary Eunice'---a very complex character. Starting out sweet and innocent, she did catch the eye of the crazed Dr. Arden.  After an exorcism gone wrong, the demon left the man but, instead of returning to hell, it entered Mary Eunice.  I think because she showed some fear and was making eye contact with it.  After that, she switched from pure and sweet to conniving, evil, sexual and even blasphemous. I still think she was a great character and loved every nuance of that character. 5 stars<br /><br />Joseph Fiennes as 'Monsignor Timothy Howard'-----a man who gave his body to Christ and loved the church, but was still weak in the flesh. He needed to conquer his own demons as well.  It's proved in the episode, \\"The Name Game\\", which happens to be a favorite for me.  I tried not to think that I'd probably want to steal his virtue, too. I know, I know. It's messed up.  But for a man of the cloth, he didn't live up to his title.  He did some pretty wicked things.  I think he double crossed Sister Jude.  He lied to cover his butt many times.  How is that doing God's work?  He did show a heart breaking vulnerability during his confession to Sister Jude that Sister Mary Eunice stole his virtue. I did feel sorry for him. I know he wasn't all bad. I think Joseph Fiennes did an outstanding job as Monsignor even though I didn't agree with the character's methods or treatment of others. It's a good thing he's so sexy. ;)  5 stars<br /><br />Zachary Quinto as 'Dr. Oliver Thredson'-----cute, wanting to help(?) and unassuming, I would've never guessed what he was actually capable of.  He was messed up a birth. He had a sick fascination with women in what I like to call his \\"Mommy Issues\\".  It took a few episodes in to find out his 'alter ego'. Sick, but so well done, that's all I have to say. 5 stars<br /><br />Sarah Paulson as 'Lana Winters'---boy, did she ever get herself into the hottest water possible.  'Curiosity killed the cat' and that's almost what happened to her as she was forced to stay at Briarcliff.  Her lover, 'Wendy Peyser', played by Clea Duvall, had no choice but to sign the papers after a visit from Sister Jude, who threatened to expose them as gay lovers.  But, it was meant to be.  Lana was the only one to be able to take down Briarcliff.  But not before her run in with Dr. Thredson, who 'freed' her from Briarcliff only to subject her to even worse horrors.  5 stars<br /><br />Evan Peters as 'Kit Walker'----this poor guy had it rough from day 1.  Labeled 'Bloody Face', he was thrown into Briarcliff.  Everyone was sure he had killed his wife, Alma, who was of a different race.  No one wanted to believe his story about alien abduction. He was a killer and a crazy loon to them.  He was almost starting to believe he had actually killed Alma. He was on the Briarcliff 'medication' and coerced so much, he admitted to Dr. Thredson that he killed Alma if that meant he could live.  Kit had no idea what Dr. Thredson planned to do with that confession. 5 stars<br /><br />James Cromwell and 'Dr. Arthur Arden'-------almost one of the sickest characters in this series. Quite a difference from 'Babe'.  He was a doctor whom I consider a quack that experimented on humans. I think it was for his own twisted pleasure.  Dr. Arden had quite a secret looming over him from his past.  Only Anne Frank knew about him.  But, again, she's crazy so no one believes her at first.  I think Sister Jude eventually started putting 2 and 2 together.  But she didn't really like the Doctor to begin with.  Dr. Arden did have a soft spot for the pure Mary Eunice.  He didn't like women who acted like, 'whores'.  He wanted all women to be pure and untouched.  But after 'The Name Game' he knew it could never be.  Even then, he could not live or die without Sister Mary Eunice. 5 stars<br /><br />Naomi Grossman as 'Pepper'-------ah, we can't forget sweet and childlike Pepper.  Diagnosed as a Hydrocephalic or 'water on the brain'.  Because of her deformity, it was easy to blame her with a terrible crime that she didn't commit. This goes to show you that you don't judge a book by its cover. I think Pepper was a fan favorite.  Naomi did a great job.  In fact, so great, my brother and I wondered if a real Hydrocephalic was used. 5 stars<br /><br />Frances Conroy as the 'Angel of Death'----------she was on a few episodes.  I loved the black wings and the calm way she came in and asked if one was ready to be kissed.  The kiss of death.  Some fought her and some were more than ready to go. 5 stars<br /><br />Chloe Sevigny as the horny girl, 'Shelley'---------the only reason she was put in Briarcliff is because she just loved sex more than the average person.  I see nothing wrong with Shelley except she loved sex with many, many men.  She was desperate to leave the hell hole she was in. Unfortunately, Dr. Arden knew she was up to something and eventually tried to rape her.  His excuse, \\"You can't rape a whore.\\"  Disgusting.  She made the mistake of laughing at his package and he went crazy himself.  He ended up 'clipping her wings' and turning her into a monster. 5 stars<br /><br />Lizzie Brocher&eacute; as 'Grace'-----------her childhood was very messed up.  She did go a bit crazy after what she endured in her home life.  She was accused of chopping up her family by her very own sister.  She didn't admit to this at first.  She became very fond of Kit Walker.  She believed his story of alien abduction. She had witnessed this as well and told him that Alma was still alive.  Grace ended up giving her life for Kit in an accidental shooting.  But, aliens were 'far more advanced' and she didn't stay dead for long. 5 stars<br /><br />Dylan McDermott as 'Ben Harmon'-----did he ever have skeletons in his closet.  Fathered by Bloody Face himself, he took after him a little too much.  He was on the search for his biological mother to do to her what she did to his dad.  But, with the theme of this show, things always get twisted. 5 stars.<br /><br />Others include Adam Levine as 'Leo Morrison' who had a role in the beginning of the show. He and his fiancee were exploring the run down shell that was once known as Briarcliff.<br /><br />Overall 5 stars.  I shock even myself.  I didn't think I would like to watch a show like this.  I can recommend it. Take it from someone who thought the worst of it.  I ended up enjoying it and I'mgoing to set my DVR for 'Coven'.calm way she came in and asked if one was ready to be kissed.

1401307787|4.0|This book has been around for quite a while...recommended to me by friends so I bought it & have only just begun to read it, so can't really give a full review.
B004T4KQJS|5.0|I like the easy to read writing style used in this book.  I have read books with similar subject matter, and this one is informative, and much more enjoyable to read.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|Saw this group on a television show & thoroughly enjoyed the performance.  A unique sound that made me smile, so I bought the CD for my collection.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This was an excellent read about a real mission in Afghanistan. It shows what a real hero is. Can't wait for the movie to come out.
159562015X|1.0|I had to do this with my team for work, and I thought it was complete rubbish. The latest mgmt. fad type of book, double-spaced in 14 point type and SO stupid. Mine said I was an intellectual who likes learning things and reading books... Wait, what are they trying to sell me? Oh, yea. A book. Sorry, it just seemed dumb, like horoscopes or something.

B002KYHZLQ|4.0|I was looking to start reading another series (after finishing the wheel of time and waiting for the next song of ice and fire) but I was hesitant to stumble upon another mediocre book, I'm pleased to find Erikson's Garden of the Moon very entertaining being its major sins the sometimes long &#34;on the road&#34; passages and another the myriad of characters and races and gods and warrens, etc. But its action packed, have its own magic system, have very humanized or characterized main characters so for me its I hope the beginning of a very fun time as I plan to read the whole series
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Excellent.  What a great way to spend a rainy day.  Having all three movies is so convient. Bluray also enhances the experience.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|A great example of awesome visual effects and a great storkine to boot! I loved how they brought some elements from the original series (Tribbles) and the original movies! Not ther Star Trek compares to the Shatner years, but these are GREAT tributes and new storylines to the best years, 2 thumbs up!
B00F91RYL8|2.0|I read the book and was terrified. I watched the movie and was bored. I am trying not to compare the two, given they are different animals, but nonetheless, the movie lacked the horror aspect the book had. I jump more during the Walking Dead than I did during this. I looked forward to watching this, hoping it would've been scary and would've brought to life some of the things described in the book.For example, the submarine, turning on the lights and seeing zombies crawling up the anchor chains because they were walking along the ocean floor.  Alas, I was disappointed. 28 Days Later still holds the #1 spot I'm my book for horrifying zombie films.
