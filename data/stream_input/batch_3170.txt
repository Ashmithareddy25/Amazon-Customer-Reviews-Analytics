B00E95ED32|1.0|to be honest i didn't even know who avicii was until that whole mess with him & Leona Lewis..his music is not that great..i downloaded only one song which was 'wake me up' on itunes..i dont really listen to it..my personal opinion is that this album is garbage.
B00E9ZATJO|5.0|You can't go wrong with Sullivan and Mike they are just too funny.  I was hoping that they would have a second Monsters release and here it is.  Everyone who has gone to college will get a kick out of this - It really isn't only just for kids.
B009EP3DJM|1.0|it has alot of songs about partying and that's about it.there's nothing new with ke$ha.it's just your typical mainstream pop trash.i don't know why people like this stuff.i don't really understand,there are alot of artist out there who are actually talented and can sing & there struggling to make it in the industry & they have a meaningful songs (which by the way isn't doing well) but mean while ke$ha (who by the way has no talent) could single about partying and it goes flying up the billboards charts..i really don't understand the industry & people who listen to this trash..my point is this album is trash just like her last album..she has like two good songs but the rest of the album is trash.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I think it a cool game. It doesn't freezes up like some other android apps and the graphics are cool to. It's endless fun.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|The interracine life in Mississippi in past decades is brought to life in this legal crime-solving epic. The intriguing ending to solve the legal drama makes the book even more interesting.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Super cute movie and can't wait for the second one to be released.  Great for all ages - nice to be able to enjoy a movie with your kids that doesn't have sex or violence in it.
B0039RY3MM|1.0|June 27, 2013 - Purchased. *** My personal experience yours may be better. This may even be my fault. You may do better. A+ certified with a better part of a decade in the industry. Most of the compound was left on the CPU. It was hard as a rock. Almost scratched off all CPU markings removing using supplied pad and alcohol. Here is a picture: [...]
B008ALA6DW|5.0|It works well, the best you can get for this situation. If you have a Macbook Air or a Pro Retina, then you may need an ethernet port at some point. While the USB one is cheaper, this one gives you better speeds. And, frankly, I never use my thunderbolt ports, and my USB ports are always being used. So I got it for that reason.<br /><br />Again, it works so well. You really cannot get a better version from any other manufacturer. The Apple one is the best for Apple products, hands down. You just have to pay a premium for it.<br /><br />For me, and I feel for anyone who already owns an Apple product, the premium was worth the convenience and dependability.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I loved Allie Brosh's little person with the pink dress and the blonde ponytail way before I had any idea who Allie Brosh was!  I totally accidentally discovered Allie's name, and then found her blog, and the mention of her recently published book.  (Some of the contents are blog posts, which is okay; they're still wry and appealing and humorous.<br /><br />I have Amazon Prime, and as soon as can figure out why this is the only Kindle book I have that doesn't show &#34;loan&#34; as one of the choices on the drop down menu, I want to share this book with a friend.<br /><br />I liked it very much. I felt sad for Allie, having read about her battle with depression, but found this book to be very non-depressing.
B00GIY5OGC|4.0|Good movie.  However, I selected and paid for the HD version and didn't seem to receive HD quality video.  Disappointing.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Wow. Talk about a train wreck! I do not understand what all the hype was about. The storyline/plot is a bit disturbing.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Delightful, entertaining, edge of the seat reading, which allows the mind to run wild with imagination.  Definitely would recommend it to others.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. It's just like the Facebook version. Minus the extras. I wish there were a few more quests.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think this game is so AWESOME it is better then temple run<br /><br />And if you get far you can go on a rollercoaster!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|the only thins is you cannot project the video from chrome on ipad. so for ipad, you can only use netflix or you tube.  if you want everything to be projected to tv then you need to use laptop, which defeats the purpose of having a wireless dongle.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Just as addictive as previous seasons. The suspense keeps you going. Good to watch during winter evenings when the days are so short.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The banter and playfulness between the characters is what I have enjoyed most in the books.  It's one of  the best parts of love relationships. And these two certainly have it, and it's contagious!<br /><br />I love E L James writing....I can't wait for her next book!
B001RTSPVY|5.0|The Breaking Bad episodes are truly addicting. Plan to buy all episodes. Great suspense and plots. Good to watch during winter evenings when the days are so short.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|So ready for the next book written by E L James<br />Whether in this series, or another!<br /><br />Please...write more books~
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really am enjoying this game a great brain teased easy enough but yet not to easy. great fun fantastic.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Was not what I expected. I was surprised how much I enjoyed it!<br />The banter and playfulness between the characters is what I have enjoyed most in the books.

0385510454|5.0|Just another great read for anyone who like reading about lawyers and enjoys mystery. John Grisham just knows what people like to read about and creates stories that entertain.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I like that it is challenging.  However sometimes it gets too hard to clear a level and you are stuck there forever. That is why I quit playing it in Facebook.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham is one of my favorite authors. His works never disapoint me. This book continues to entertain my best thoughts about lawyering in the south where discrimination continues today. This book goes into the relationships between races, without becoming a part of either side of the issues.
B00E9ZATJO|1.0|Has areas of no sound so Amazon replaced it at no additional charge and the replacement dvd was also defective ( same scene without sound).  Does Disney want these out so fast that there is no quality control?
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|So easy to access Amazon when I&#34;m on the go!  It has all the bells and whistles in a tiny little package
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Very intriguing game s nice I love hidden objects this game is challenging. No board is ever predictable, and I like that.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book in embodies the heart of an American. Truly a son of our Lord. One must read this book in the truth, all of the power of our Lord and the courage of a fearless warrior
6304493681|5.0|Love this movie. I wanted to pick this up on Blu-Ray, but sadly that version includes heavily altered scenes that just ruin the movie for me. That's just my opinion so please go ahead and do your own research on how the two differ if your looking to purchase this film.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|While we love its streaming of Youtube content, rest of pure chrome web casting is patchy at best.  Casting stops and terminates for no reason and after several restarts we give up.  It is also not cool that chrome browser can not cast from iPad/iPhones. I am disappointed at this sub-optimal product from Google.
B00AYB12PC|1.0|Started to watch it, but just couldn't get past the blood and sadistic guy on the phone.  Would NOT recommend this to anyone I know.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Castleville has a good interface and eases you into the game.  The fun just goes up from there with entertaining graphics and smooth operation on a kindle fire HD.
B002GKQ5MY|5.0|If the series had to end, I liked the way they tied everything up.  It was lovely to see old characters I grew to love come back for a final &#34;good-bye&#34;.  Miss these girls but glad I have the DVDs to watch again and again.
B00EMAGCJM|5.0|Stepdaughter loves this album. Bought it for her and she loves it. She had wnated a long time ago and now is happy
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|My child downloaded this and she really enjoys it. Says she wants to be a hunter just like her uncle. ;)
B00F0N61AU|5.0|Stepdaughter love album and was anxiously waiting for the CD to come out in order to buy it and she loves it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Huge fan of Stephen King, loved The Shining and was excited to see what happened to little Danny Torrance.  This book did not disappoint, would love to read more about The True Knot and their origins, especially Rose the Hat.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|At first I thought it would actually suck but after getting it I actually like it and recommend it to anyone with a decent tablet or phone with lots of processing power.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|This story is STILL spinning in my head. Elizabeth Gilbert is one of my favorite authors, and her latest novel doesn't disappoint. You will grow to love and respect, as well as cheer for, Alma!
B00B1RB942|5.0|This movie is amazing and I was very surprised how good it was. A must have for Anime fans. The story is funny and has depth for most of the characters and spends enough time filling out their personalities throughout the film. It's light hearted at times and dead serious at other times. Plenty of ups and downs through out the film that is just fun to watch. I'd recommend it to any one who is looking for a good watch and a surprise from what the cover seems to offer.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|4-1/2.  Very creative, interesting characters. Interesting read.<br />Enough already. Amazon should NOT require number of words to submit a review!
B00AGOGOLE|4.0|Wish it did not take as much room on my kindle anyway it's great I would get it still get it if I were you
B0036TGT2A|5.0|So happy with this 3 disc Diamond edition - great for any Little Mermaid fan out there, young or old :)
B00CATSONE|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. I discovered a lot about a man I thought I knew about.  Everyone should read at least a little of such an amazing man. He is very inspiring.
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|LOVE this set - lots of fun little extras and bonus features for every Breaking Bad fan.  No, not everyone cares if they have the series in a boxed set, but if you do, this is pretty great :) Bigger than I thought it would be, it's a great collector piece!
B009NF54ZE|5.0|Picked this app for free and it has delivered a great game with mini games in each level. I would highly recommend this for young and old alike.
1603427244|5.0|Just an excellent little book full of techniques and tips that any knitter will refer to over and over again!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Awesome!  We use it several times a day, and we can ever stream things from our smartphones.  This is an amazing product that makes an awesome cheap gift!
B00GH4R95C|5.0|good family movie, touches on a lot of subjects yet Superman overcomes all indifference while showing a genuine love for his fellow man.
B00000DI06|5.0|Purchased for Magnificat and very much worth it. Wonderfully performed by all.  You will enjoy this recording, particularly if you like Rutter.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I think that minion rush is a fun game to play and I think that if you have a kindle or an iPad you should get this game  but you have to be patient because it is a hard game and you have to play allot of times to become very good at it
B000FC10MU|2.0|This book was readable, but ultimately not very interesting. The idea that old &#34;Gods&#34; brought to America by immigrants who worshipped them, and who became weaker as followers turned to new gods was clever. I thought the characters were not well achieved, and the &#34;good guys&#34; versus &#34;bad guys&#34; aspect of the old gods against the &#34;new gods&#34; of internet, TV, money, etc. was very simplistic. There were moments when the book came alive, such as the story of the brother and sister who were enslaved in Africa, brought to America and separated, but there weren't enough of these. I have heard so much about this writer that I was eager to read one of his books, and perhaps chose the wrong one. Or it may be that he is writing to a younger audience.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved everything. Great storyline, great characters and personalities, and great twist-ending and fresh beginning for the third book. Good job.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This app is pretty cool. It took them long enough to offer this. Now if only they fix the oovoo app, I'll be happy
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I like the tutorial. Fun non thinking game for when you want to wind down after work. The graphics are just like the movie.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Cheryl Strayed Heck yah! Love this woman's point of view. Raw and authentic. This is not my favorite Cheryl though... look up Dear Sugar.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book<br />I will v read it again and again.  This is my second reading it already. Wish there was another
2061011306|4.0|Great map!  Huge, accurate, colorful.  Why isn't it laminated?  I thought it would be.  Also, it came rolled but with a slight crease across the middle.  You really only notice it in the pacific ocean, but the paper shows marks VERY easily.  This wouldn't happen if it were laminated!
B00GFOIUVQ|3.0|I really don't understand the keys or how to control thor in fighting but apart from that is cool yeah
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I either love a book and devour it quickly, or I dawdle, trying to finish what I've started. This is my third time reading The Hunger Games --my first book read through to the end on my Kindle Fire. I could not put this book down!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised to find this game for my kindle. Works great! Thanks for finally making it out way.
B00DB2JQ7W|5.0|It is a two CD set.  One with just Gov't Mule and the other with special guests.  I bought the CD and got the MP3 downloads for free!
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|This game is challenging and fun, when you are bored or have nothing to do, playing this game makes your life a WHOLE lot funnier. I would recommend this game to anyone that happens to have a boring life. Hope you enjoy this game as I did.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Enjoy football game days. Love to interact with my friends and new acquaintance's. This is a great way to get started on twitter if you have ever wanted to join in the talk
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Poorly written. All these people were reading it so I thought I would.. I deleted it from all out kindles.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is really addictive! It's an awesome study break for us students :) I love it and play it daily!
B008RF0M9O|5.0|Very effective replacement, with better sound isolation than the original.  But, took me 20 min to figure and fit the first pad using the edge of a credit card to shove the wrap into the slot.  Only five min to do the second.  Used a thin rubber band to hold in groove.
B00EVW04PE|4.0|it was a funny movie. Jamie Fox wearing Jordans was hilarious! Channing Tatum is so manly! I enjoyed this movie!
B0036FYO12|5.0|Classic spy thriller.  Emphasis more on the plot than on the &#34;action chase.&#34;  Excellent Pollack film which is worth watching.
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|David Baldacci scores with top marks again!! The pace of the writing keep me glued to my kindle. And the story line and character development was everything I have come to expect from such a great author.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|The first Chromecast I ordered was very easy to set up and use.  However, within one week it completely failed on me.  It was displaying a pink light, my TV couldn't find the device, it would not reset (either by holding reset button or unplugging and replugging back in).  After several very frustrating calls with Google, they finally sent me a replacement unit.  I've had it over a month and have had zero problems with it so far.  Perhaps I just got a lemon originally.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Excellent book. Amazing follow up to the first. A must read. Very much looking forward to the next. Finished the first two books in 3days.
B00F1BFRA6|2.0|I love Downton Abbey but this season is very slow to get out of the gate.  SPOILER ALERT::  Come on Mary has 3 suitors, Come On,  Is Mary the only game in town?.  Poor Edith has non stop unhappiness,  how much can one girl take.  The Anna storyline does come to life, she finally gets a juicy morsel.  Poor Thomas, his role back to the shadows and just being his manipulative self. Last season we saw some real choice moments for Thomas, but now his part is on the back burner.  It would be nice to see Thomas grow as the man hinted at last season, and maybe show some warmth and maybe some love for him.  Elizabeth Mcgovern's role is just so bland like she has no insight into whats going on at all.  Maggie Smith is always terrific.  This season was slow going it took a long time to take hold and they did not work enough storyline into more of the characters.  Like I said 3 suitors for Mary OH BROTHER!
B000HEWEDK|5.0|I love this movie as it was the first sci fi movie I saw which attracted me to science fiction
B0090SI4LU|3.0|I streamed this last night, and enjoyed it.  It's got a good sci fi premise with some good performances.  I hadn't heard of the book, and had no idea this was a Meyer story until I saw her name in the credits at the end.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. It's got some good performances.  Ronan especially is completely convincing as the alien, Wanderer.  While there probably should have been more set up for her alter-ego Melanie, there was a strong contrast between the two, even if Mel came of as a bit petulant.  Hurt also anchors the film as the down to earth uncle.  And Kruger is intense as the seeker, and her arc is actually as interesting as Ronan's.<br /><br />2. It's got a good premise.  I liked the slow burn and thought provoking questions: What makes us human? How would I react if I was occupied by another intelligence?<br /><br />3. There were no explosions.  I was glad to watch a sci fi film that focused much more on philosophical questions than action.  While there is some action, it's in context and adds to the story.  The Aliens are non-violent, but one of them becomes violent at one point, and it adds to the greater narrative and themes.<br /><br />Conflicted:<br />1. World building was hit or miss.  There was a mix of futuristic sci fi and modern day.  I couldn't really figure out if this took place in the current day or 100 years from now and that took me out of the story.  And no, you don't say &#34;Look the survivors have all current-day stuff, because they're survivors&#34;  If you're going to do that, you need to make the old stuff really, really old.  It all looked brand new.  As did the survivors.  You don't need to look as haggard as the survivors in The Road, but you need more than the freshly-washed-showered-and-pressed look that the survivors had in this movie.  That being said, I like the alien urban environment and tech.  It fit their philosophy well.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. How on Earth did they manage to spend $40M making this movie?  It looks made for TV in all ways: shot on digital video, cheap sets, cheap effects, etc. etc.  A typical episode of Firefly looks better than this, and those were made for well under $1M per epi.<br /><br />2. The romantic triangle fell completely flat in all ways.  It wasn't believable.  People just don't act that way.  I won't go into specifics here due to spoilers, but I'm willing to discuss in comments if anyone disagrees.<br /><br />3. I didn't really like the survivor's camp.  That location, while I appreciated the vistas, is probably the worst one you can think of to hide in.  They would have so easily been discovered and captured with that amount of visibility.  I would have much preferred Twilight's location of the Pacific NW.  It's much easier to hide in the mountains and the forest, and it would have added a grittier contrast to the alien urban environments.  Also, there's no way in Hell you'd have running water in that location.  Sorry.<br /><br />4. I would have preferred a more realistic portrayal of Survivor life.  They were so blase about security (that they were surprised by the alien patrols is ridiculous given their location), and blase about acquiring supplies.  They should have been acting much more alert and sneakier.  And the power dynamics in the camp were also poorly done.<br /><br />If you think you can overlook the downsides, I'd recommend this to sci fi fans.  Even with its flaws it's much more thought provoking than much recent sci fi fare such as Transformers, Elysium, After Earth, Into Darkness, and such.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|awesome...haven't spent a dime and enjoying the challenges. a great game that takes a good eye.  I don't. know much about guns but it doesn't matter.
B0001XAPY2|5.0|This is my favorite Studio Ghibli movie. Great characters, setting and SEAPLANE FIGHTS! Funny, touching, and beautiful. I'd put this up against any movie ever on all the metrics that matter: character, visuals, story, metaphor. Delicate and true, like all Miyazaki movies, plus SEAPLANE FIGHTS!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have always loved this game on my computer an .<br />d was happy to find it for my Kindle Fire. If I Could change one thing, I'd Change the picture on the deck of cards. I know it's called Spider Solitaire, but I hate spiders and having the big black spider on my Kindle freaks me out.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book had a great story line and kept my interest until the very end.  It's unique in that its told from both character's point of view but the ending, although some may not care for it, was in the true spirit of the character and therefore I felt was very satisfying.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Fun, until you get the hang of it. I have been playing it for 2-3 hours, I am addicted. I would rate four out of five stars.
B003B02PEU|5.0|I've read most of Grisham' s works.  This one is more introspective and World-weary and ends on a sad, ambiguous, note, just like real life.  The maturation of a true artist.
B0095XPZBC|4.0|While the first two seasons are not the best in TNG, the content was getting better.  Other reviews have said that the HD transfer was handled as well with this release, but I never saw any noticeable issues.  I only rated this item four stars because of it not being the best of the seasons, though it did have some gems in it like &#34;Q Who&#34;, &#34;Contagion&#34;, and of course &#34;The Measure of a Man&#34;.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Really good I love it the fun is deadly serious the best is the egg and  is the best what do you think
B000FC1K66|3.0|Was as removed from narrative as starring characters in and of this tale.  Maybe the author's intent in the first place perhaps?
B00BMR5HOO|5.0|This weather app is great, easy to use and works really well. Never an issue with freezing or stopping. I am really happy I installed it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its an amazing game everyone should get it. The is enjoyable by all ages. People need to realize the awsomeness of this amazing game.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The ending and the change in personality where out  of character. She stayed so strong throughout the story to see her fall apart at the end was disappointing.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen king never disappoints and he definitely did not here. Please don't stop Mr. King!  You keep my mind sharp and make me realize my own deficiencies.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Why, oh why are trilogies giving me grief?? It seems that the first book hooks me and I'm a complete fan; the second one is okay, but seems to be a bridge between the beginning and ending, so of course, I'm left wanting more; the third one is usually disappointing because it doesn't live up to the hype. I will admit that this one was a better third book than others, but it still wasn't what I was hoping it would be.<br /><br />First of all, if you haven't read the other two recently and you're like me and don't retain a lot, read them before you start this book!! I had a hard time remembering who was who and what was going on. It seems to pick up right where book 2 left off. Yes, questions were answered, but nothing was as expected. It seemed to me that instead of things being black and white, things were very muddled--no clear, right choices, just wrong and more wrong.<br /><br />We see characters that we know and love and some that were forgettable to me, but there doesn't seem to be a lot happening in the story, except for bits and pieces here and there. I loved some of the realizations that Tris and Tobias came to and the life lessons that were learned.<br /><br />And then, WHAT?! I was taken completely off guard by the ending. I'm still not completely satisfied with it, but in some ways, it was a good ending to the series.<br /><br />Content: kissing scenes; violence; some language (it seemed like there might have been more than in the others); there was one scene that wasn't very descriptive, but seemed to be a sexual scene involving teens that faded to black.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works great! Just know that right now there aren't too many compatible services. I really wish Amazon would finally add Instant View to Android and Chromecast, and not just Google TV already, but there are some great apps like HBO Go, Netflix, Google's services, Hulu Plus, and Pandora (check Google or Wikipedia to see a full list of services working on Chromecast apps). If you're willing to wait it out, Google has pretty much promised more content providers on the way. These things just take a little time.<br /><br />Also, this thing is cheap as all heck. If this dongle can cast services you already pay for, or services you want, then by all means you should probably get this instead of a more expensive option like Roku or Apple TV. Each device has pros, cons, and limitations, but a $35 price tag is hard to beat.<br /><br />Plus, this thing has a lot of potential once it is opened up. It runs on a strange intersection between Android and Chrome OS, but once the software is fully open to developers, you can be guaranteed a lot of extra functionality. Especially if you have any Android devices.<br /><br />In conclusion, even if some apps may not be released for awhile, or maybe even fall through, for what it is, the Chromecast is a big bang for the buck. Subscribers of Netflix, Hulu Plus, and HBO Go will definitely enjoy this dongle.
0062107313|5.0|With her first novel in eight years, Amy Tan returns to the theme that she does so well: mothers and daughters. Spanning four generations and two continents, The Valley of Amazement tells us the story of Lucia (Lulu), her daughter Violet, Violet’s daughter Flora, and Magic Gourd, the courtesan who stood in as surrogate mother to Violet after her mother left her in Shanghai.<br /><br />Conflicts with her mother and father lead Lulu to become sexually active at a young age and at a time when this was not permissible to women. When she falls in love with a visiting Chinese artist, she runs away from home and follows him to Shanghai. But she ends up having to make her own way, with Violet a toddler and her infant son kidnapped by the artist’s family. With few paths open to a woman in China at the time, Lulu chooses to establish a courtesan house, which becomes renowned for accepting both Western and Chinese clients and for providing business advice. She becomes wealthy, but doesn’t realize what growing up in a brothel, however high class, is doing to her daughter, who feels the business- and her missing brother- mean more to Lulu than Violet does, just as Lulu had felt her mother’s passion for science mean more to her than Lulu did.<br /><br />The story is written from more than one point of view; Violet, Magic Gourd, and Lulu all take a turn speaking. All have hard lives; the men in their lives are, for the most part, uncaring as to the needs of the women, treating them as objects that will be dealt with only when convenient- or even keeping them as outright slaves. Taking place in the dawn of the 20th century, the story is set against the political and social changes that took place in China.<br /><br />I loved this book and couldn’t put it down. The details of the lives of these women made them come alive; what they wore, what they were expected to do, how they felt. I have to admit I had a hard time liking Violet at first; she comes off as a spoiled brat in some ways, but when you figure that she was being left on her own so much of the time, with only her cat as a friend, it’s hard to expect her to be otherwise. And she very quickly learned how hard life could be later. I was disappointed in ‘Saving Fish From Drowning’ but I’m very happy to see that Tan has returned with a great story.n some ways, but when you figure that she was being left on her own so much of the time, with only her cat as a friend, it’s hard to expect her to be otherwise. And she very quickly learned how hard life could be later. I was disappointed in ‘Saving Fish From Drowning’ but I’m very happy to see that Tan has returned with a great story.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|After the build up in book two about what was beyond the fence, I felt book three was a let down. Also Ms. Roth I live in real life everyday but read fiction to escape to a world of happy endings.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Exciting, fast moving read. I'm somewhat disappointed that I've finished with this book. I would rather that it continued on. I'll just look for the next book to find out how life unfolds for Jack Ryan and Jack Jr.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The game is awesomely fun with the different characters. Also the boss levels are fun with the different villains<br />Moo
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I liked the book A lot and some people say it's the best book ever but for it was a good book just not the best. I liked everything but the fast story line. I want a story line that it feels like I'm part of the book and that makes me feel the main characters feelings. and this book didn't have that but other tha that it was a Great book. It was worth the money.

B00GP0G0IK|5.0|Awesome game. Graphics are superior. Mini games are a challenge, and a stretch for my brain, thanks for the skip buttons. Game moves quickly. Played on kindle 8.5 with no problems. Thanks for a super game.
B00F2362IE|2.0|As an old school avid fan of TMNT I have to say Nickelodeon is getting a quick few bucks off of everyone who buys this. Just another jet pack style game. Some reviews compare this to the old ones but I ask, what game did you play in the old days. This is in no way like any of the old games. Takes a lifetime to rack up coins if you want to unlock anything without spending more money out of your pocket. Also, what's up with the attack button? It works and then it doesn't. Pretty lame. Fail!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|WOW can this book transform your life by realizing how we all must move on to HEaven which was experienced by a skeptic doctor.  READ THIS BOOK It may change how you think about the process of death!

B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Yes, this is a good book. I am through experiment number one and yes, it did indeed work. The author is very funny and keeps the reader interested. I bought the book on Kindle and that made it easy and fast.
1476727651|5.0|If you ever wondered what happened to the kid in The Shining, this is a must read. I am an avid King fan but I never read The Shining; I only saw the movie. Although you don't need to read The Shining first, it helps you understand this story if you do. Doctor Sleep is typical Stephen King horror and I loved every word of it.
B005MMZ63C|3.0|I know this movie is rated #1 on best film, but I just don't understand why? Maybe the cinematography was superb for that day and time, or maybe it was because of Orson Welles, but I really thought it was just okay.

B001XUH69Y|4.0|This is a good movie and once  you watch it you realize where a lot of the famous saying's come from, such as &#34;Here's looking at you kid&#34;. I don't think I would have rated it as a top ten of all time, and I had a hard time really getting into it at first, but it turned out pretty good.
1781162646|5.0|At first I was curious how Stephen would perform while assuming the role of a twenty-one year old dude. Well, I think it's fair to say that he nailed it. It seems that KIng is of that rare breed of writers that, although four decades removed from his twenties, still possesses the uncanny ability to convey emotions and feelings from any point of view, regardless of age or era.<br />Joyland was quite the joy for me, as I can too easily remember my mindset and motivations at twenty-one. It hit home to say the least. I laughed. I cried. I got mad. I got glad. And, ultimately, I marveled at King's remarkable talent in bringing me to tears.<br />Short and sweet, but plenty to eat. A bittersweet symphony.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Good movie, worth the watch. Great storyline! I am glad it is just a story. I would hate for our civilization to come to this for entertainment!

B00DJZR46G|2.0|I am a very big Elton John. I have looked forward to this release for a while; however, when I got it and listened to it, I was not impressed with this title. I found the songs lackluster, both musically and lyrically. I actually wish I hadn't purchased this.
B009CVRQLY|5.0|The title of the album says it all, she loved us all back to life! The sound of this album is so different from any of her others, even Taking Chances, which was her first \\"edgy\\" album. Vocally she's still #1 and with the new styles she has tried out with this album it shows. Even though she allows her voice to be raspy and break when the song gets emotional it still sounds perfect. My personal favorites are Water and a Flame, Didn't Know Love, Save Your Soul, Thank You, and Breakaway. A must for your Celine collection.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|The plane crash sequence was incredible and the overall story and acting excellent. Denzel Washington does an outstanding job depicting someone struggling with addiction.

I will not watch the movies now.  Don't feel like reliving the disappointment.  Also, this is the last Veronica Roth book I will ever read.

B008JFUS5A|5.0|Fans of the Hunger Games were dissapointed with the first movie and rightfully so. The film was pretty good, but didn't do the book justice, as it was extremely toned down and nowhere near as in depth as the book was. With a new director for the second book, they did not make the same mistake twice. As someone who has read all the books, I can tell you that Catching Fire is page for page exactly like the book. It was so amazing how much of the book is captured on the screen, as I actually saw the scenes play out the exact same way they did in my head when I first read Catching Fire. Everything down to the last detail is perfect! Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson return and are both fantastic, so good in fact, that I really wonder if Suzanne Collins had them in mind when she wrote this series. The casting is perfect, the acting is perfect, and the direction is perfect. For those of you who never read the series and didn't really see what was so special about the first film, I really suggest that you give this film a chance. I won't give anything away, but this isn't what you expect, especially the ending, and while there are two more films remaining, this will be your last look inside the arena. After Catching Fire, the series turns into something completely different and that's what I love about it. It would have been simple to have three books about the games, but the games are actually a small part of the second film, and won't take place in the next two films. Rarely do I give a film 5 stars, but the second Hunger Games film is done so much better than the first. They don't hold anything back in this one, and you are introduced to a whole other set of unique characters, that you will be seeing in the other films. The cast is brilliant and new Director, Francis Lawrence, manages to capture essence of the book and bring it to life on the big screen, with unbelievable detail. If you didn't read the books and just don't understand what's so great about this series, go see this movie.

B009MO5E10|2.0|By now, it's no secret that I'll watch anything with Joseph Gordon-Levitt in it. When I saw he was going to be in an action thriller, about bike messengers in Manhattan, I couldn't wait to see it, but sadly I was very disappointed. It's a normal day for bike messenger Riley (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), as he picks up a package and goes on his way. Everything is fine until a strange man tries to run him down and steal the package. From there its a race through NYC to see who gets the mysterious package first. Premium Rush is Gone In 60 Seconds on bicycles. The plot is weak, the story is predictable, and the whole film is basically one big chase through Manhattan. Yes, Premium Rush is exciting at first, but after a half hour, it gets very tiresome, very quickly. JGL tries his hardest to turn this film into something, but even a star of his caliber can't save this film, because there really isn't anything to save. It's as if the producers said, lets have a car chasing a bike in New York City and develop some kind of story around that. It doesn't work, because seldom I have been this bored and frustrated by an action movie. It stars one of my top 10 favorite actors, but there really isn't much of a role for him to play. I really hate to say it, but this film is a complete loser, don't waste your time on it.

B00005JNEW|5.0|\\"Friday Night Lights\\" is a sports drama film which follows the 1988 Permian Panthers High School football team from Odessa, Texas. The film offers interchanging perspectives from key protagonists, which primarily consists of: Coach Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton), Mike Winchell (Lucas Black), Don Billingsley (Garrett Hedlund) and James \\"Boobie\\" Miles (Derek Luke).<br /><br />The narrative stretches beyond the Permian Panthers and also examines the local community in Odessa, and their high school football culture. The team in many ways represents broader hopes and dreams, and serves as a sporting delegate to the district. Pride and tradition is deeply instilled in the team and the players carry not only their own goals and expectations, but also those from people with a deep connection to the team.<br /><br />Whilst the players are high performing athletes their lives present various challenges and the diversity of their circumstances provides the viewer with additional appreciation of the depth of the story.<br /><br />The quality of acting displays authentic and interesting characters and the movie takes the viewer on a journey stacked with glory, aspirations and the progression of youth to manhood.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author

B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is a powerful book.  It takes on the Holocaust from the civilian German's perspective with sensitivity and without glossing over their culpability.  Mr. Zusak developed his characters brilliantly...the bully and the gentle  pacifist, the idealist and the idealog, the pessimist and the pragmatist...to illustrate how  convenient racism an be and how pervasive  and he does so without ever being &#34;preachy&#34;.  The narrator, who is death, is an almost dispassionate observer without being macabre. This book has made my top 5 list. I wouldn't hesitate recommending it.

B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This book was pleasantly surprising and held my attention within the first few chapters. All the characters were relatable and unsophisticatedly flawed, sometimes even irritably real in their ignorance.<br /><br />I liked how the stories wove their way into one another without complication or force. It was a comical, witty, intriguing book that made the reader contemplate what their own decisions might be in the situations the characters created for themselves.<br /><br />I'd recommend this book to anyone who likes a well-written book of what-ifs.

B006XF5BTG|5.0|A really simple, friendly, strong and supported summary of body building science. I’ve been following the program for almost 2 months now and I’ve gained 5 kilos of muscle and lots of strength, that is my main goal.<br /><br />I came across the book after doing a lot of research on the subject, and it really summarizes pretty much everything you need to know about BB and strength training.<br /><br />Another great thing is the &#34;post sale service&#34;, as Mike has answered every single question I've asked through any of his social media platforms (facebook, mail, etc).<br /><br />Im grateful for finding this book and would definitely recommend it for both begginers to advanced lifters.

0385335989|5.0|Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series is the best series of books I have ever read.  They storyline and characters range from interesting to mesmerizing and are all unforgettable.  One of the main points in the series is the historically correct and educational history woven expertly into the story in all of her books that educate while entertain as one follows the wonderful adventures within each of the lives and as they interweave in the series of books.  I read them first and then my daughter has found them at the top of her much read list.<br />Recommended to anyone who loves the best of the best books!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This is an easy to install media streaming device for your HDTV.  We have a wall mounted TV without a set top box (no place to hang one).  It's a unit that operates with a cable card (I find it incredible that the support of cable card technology was the \\"mechanism\\" used by the cable industry to obtain FCC approval for encrypting digital cable signals and now (since about 2008) no one makes TVs that support the technology).  In any event, it was easy to install and it required just one reboot of our wireless access point to get it to show up on the network.  My only complaint is that there are only a few streaming services that support it.  Amazon Instant Video is not one of them and should be!

1612680011|5.0|Great book.  The guy repeats himself a lot, but the message is loud and clear.  IMHO, it seems as though 99/100 people (critics, reviewers, peers, friends of mine, etc) miss the point of the book, regardless of whether they liked it or not.  I suppose this is consistent with the fact that 99/100 people will fail to ever generate any real wealth for themselves...

B00008J2PG|5.0|My sister suggested I watch this movie.  It specifically shows that the Catholic Church was against the Nazi, and did whatever they could to assist the people. This in reminds me of &#34;The Bells of St. Mary's&#34;  with Bing Crosby.  The good priests.  Gregory Peck does an excellent job.

B00BU1DH1M|5.0|Ian Rankin is a top British crime writer and this is #19 in the extremely successful Inspector Rebus series. Recently I have read a lot of books by popular authors who try to put new life into a series that should be running out of steam. With this book Rankin is doing the same by taking us back to the John Rebus's early days in the police force and reviewing what he really is and what he has become.<br /><br />John Rebus is back in the force which is his only life. The only way at his age he can continue to work in the force is to take a demotion to Detective Sergeant and he is now working for his old proteg&eacute; Detective Inspector Siobhan (pronounced shiv-on) Clarke. Their first case together is a car crash where the daughter of an important London businessman is badly injured in a single driver car crash. What is strange is that her seat belt is unbuckled and one of her shoes finished up under the passenger seat, suggesting that someone else was driving and had moved her into the driving seat to cover up his part in the crash. Her boyfriend happens to be the son of Pat McCuskey, the Scottish Justice Minister and a top protagonist in favour of an independent Scotland.<br /><br />At the same time DI Malcolm Fox of the Complaints Division (their Internal Affairs) is looking at a 30 year old case that involved the detectives at the Summerhall Police Station who were well known for keeping down the crime rate by doing things their way and sometimes bending the law to do this. Rebus was a raw Detective Constable at the time and was recruited to become one of the \\"Saints of the Shadow Bible\\" who swore to uphold their own policing standards. Rebus admits that at times he did a few things he now regrets but he was never knowingly involved in really bad things. While initially wary of Fox, John Rebus decides to help him with his investigation with the philosophy of \\"if you don't like them join them\\". Surprisingly Rebus and Fox work well together, but with slightly different motivations.<br /><br />Most of the living members of the Saints are retired and frail, but DI Stefan Gilmour has moved on to become a very rich property developer who is a major proponent of the \\"No\\" case for an independent Scotland. Fox's investigations mainly centre on the acquittal of Billy Saunders for murder which he believes was manipulated by the Saints especially because Gilmour resigned from the force at that time. The investigation builds strength when Saunders disappears and is later found shot by a gun known to have been confiscated years ago by one of the Saints.<br /><br />John Rebus is a enigmatic character who, despite his age, is still at the top of his game but no longer at the top of the force. He is a loner who collects evidence in his own ways and feeds it where it will have the most effect. While he was a member of the Saints he is prepared to look at all of their sins with Fox and make his own judgements.<br /><br />In my opinion most authors I have read recently attempting a series revival have failed my tests in some way. Ian Rankin passed my tests with flying colours with this very clever and well written Scottish police/crime story which seamlessly mixes the past with the present against a timely backdrop of the current buildup to the referendum for an independent Scotland. While it is part of a series it can easily be read as a standalone story. I recommend this book to all lovers of UK crime stories and to others who want to get a good introduction to this genre.motivations.<br /><br />Most of the living members of the Saints are retired and frail, but DI Stefan Gilmour has moved on to become a very rich property developer who is a major proponent of the \\"No\\" case for an independent Scotland.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|Let me start off by saying, I loved Divergent. It was unique, intense, introduced great characters, and had phenomenal world building. Insurgent was really good, but I felt like it was missing the spark that was Divergent. I don't know what was missing. I speculated that it was Tris and Four - their relationship was this amazing building block in Divergent and had become not necessarily an obstacle but they weren't always beside one another. Insurgent pushed the envelope in terms of their relationship, in many ways putting them at odds and making you miss what they had. It's probably why I'd give Insurgent 4 stars and Divergent 5 stars.<br /><br />So, with high hopes I purchased a copy of Allegiant. There's something about trilogies and lately I feel like they're hit or misses. The author has created this grand story, with characters you've invested in emotionally. Unlike a single book on its own, you read it for a few days or a week, put it down and are done. Series have a way of capturing you long term. You read the first book. You fall for the characters, the story, the plot and pacing. You become a part of the adventure. Each book is like unlocking a secret into a world you want to know more about. You're given only pieces of the story in the series and it's the final book that you expect answers, and in many cases hope for a happy ending.<br /><br />The first part of this review for Allegiant will be spoiler free. I will have a warning for when I explain the details of my rating.<br /><br />I commend Roth for taking a chance with using both Tris and Four's voice for alternating chapters. It was something the readers looked forward to. I feared it and will explain why beneath where spoilers are below.<br /><br />I felt the pacing in Allegiant was off. I read it, I turned the page, I put the book down. I read Divergent in three days. It took me ten days to read Allegiant. At least one, if not two of those nights I deliberately chose not to read the book. I needed a break from it. There wasn't enough action and when it was integrated into the plot, it didn't flow like Divergent had. Maybe I remember Divergent different then it was. Maybe I've put the book high on a pedestal and Allegiant could never compare. Personally, I don't think that's the case. I just felt bored by the story. I also felt some of the explanations (Divergent and what it means) ruined the series for me. The pieces of the puzzle (Divergent & Insurgent) when put together and given a full explanation consisted of disappointment (Allegiant).<br /><br />SPOILERS BELOW<br /><br />So here's the thing. I've read other trilogies lately, Dystopian and felt the endings fell flat. For example, Lauren Oliver's Requiem (Delirium 3). I loved the first two books in her series. The third book felt like a cop out. She has a love triangle with two guys and doesn't give us an actual ending. It's the final book. We want everything spelled out for us, happy ending and all, including what happens to everyone. No such luck. I loved Mockingjay's ending for The Hunger Games. I know there are others out there that hated it but of all the dystopian endings lately, that has been the best I've read. The  I suppose it's how it's done, unraveling the story and still keeping certain elements alive.<br /><br />Here's my issue with Allegiant. It wasn't just a sad ending. It felt like part of it was unnecessary. Tris risks her life, knowing she is doing it to save her brother that betrayed her. I read the reasoning, I understand it. I can even accept that she went in to do the mission. Okay. She struggled but survived. What I thought sucked, yes this is how I felt, was that after everything she got shot. I'd have rather her died from the poison. I felt like being shot was so blah. Like - this is how she died? She's this big, bad ass chick that we've fallen in love with and she's dead from a friggin' bullet. Maybe I expect too much. If she's going to die, it should be bigger, bolder.<br /><br />Okay next, Tris and Four's point of view. I loved the idea that we'd finally feel and experience things from Four's perspective. I was a little nervous though. If only for the fact that let's face it - in first person point of view - the person telling the story can't die. If they're telling the story, they make it to the end, they're safe. (Unless you're reading a diary style novel). Now the author brings in Four's POV. The initial fan reaction was YAY! I felt that too, until I realized it means, Tris is very much at risk for dying. Could Tobias/Four be killed off? Sure, but then it would have remained in Tris' point of view. So, from the beginning I knew the basic fact for the ending. Plus, with the fan reaction of OMG horrible ending, it was quick to realize that it was probably fact. All that aside, my actual opinion on the point of view switch is that the intent was good, the execution fell flat to me. The chapters didn't feel different upon reading them. I also didn't feel like Four was the character we met in Divergent. The toughness to him had melted away, and not in an enjoyable way. I half-wonder if the books issues are a result of the movie being constructed. Authors have a character in their head. Then when the movie is being produced, seeing a new version of a character (and with a director that may have a different vision than what you had), it's possible your own perception shifts while writing the novel. It may be something you don't even notice doing, or perhaps I just felt like Tobias was out of character in his dialogue and thoughts.<br /><br />Why do I feel this way? For example we learn what Divergent actually means. Tobias gets super emotional over it. Don't get me wrong, the initial shock would probably bother most people. Dauntless are taught to be tough. Tobias has been strong in the first two novels. To see him come so easily undone by people that you don't know, truths you're told that you wonder if they're actually real, it was a mess to me. Which leads to..<br /><br />Too much of the book focused on Genetically Pure and Genetically Damaged. The whole meaning of Divergent, the cool aspect of what these people were disappeared. The spark that had been created in the first book, fizzled out. For example, online we choose factions based on the books. It's fun, it's a way to connect with readers, and it's also a way to show what we think of ourselves. Veronica Roth did amazing in creating these factions. The factions themselves, the initial idea was smart. Readers connected with it. I felt the unfolding of it in Allegiant wasn't done well. Maybe it was the explanation itself that I didn't like. It all being an experiment, Divergent's are Genetically Pure and everyone else is Genetically Damaged. Too much of the book focused on this and it was something that I understood, but didn't connect with. When reading it on my Kindle - I noticed that at 80% the story kicked up a notch. I felt like we finally had the action that I'd been missing. Veronica Roth writes action well. I missed it in Allegiant.<br /><br />Would I recommend Allegiant? If you've read, Divergent, then you're likely going to want to finish the series and know what happens to the characters. Will I read another book by Veronica Roth? Honestly, I don't know. I don't like investing in characters and not liking the final book. It doesn't need to be a best seller, but I do need to feel like my time wasn't wasted and that the author cares about the characters too. That aside, I'm not a fan of unhappy endings, unless I'm reading a Contemporary novel (stand-alone, not a series). I think if you're investing in the time it takes to read a series, then readers are going to expect an ending they want for the characters they love. Otherwise, you're taking a chance at antagonizing the audience. Just my 2 cents.r />Okay next, Tris and Four's point of view.

015603008X|5.0|Love this book...! Read this &#34;years&#34; ago when I was in school and just had to have it...! So happy to have found it at a very reasonable price and in excellent shape...!!!!
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|The style of writing took some getting used to.  A quick and fairly satisfying read.  I read this because it was the first of the series.  Now that I know the main character and writing style, I'll probably read more of the series.
B0002TKFGI|3.0|Just had my first listen. I recently got a new sub (Klipsch SW-311) and wanted to see how she would handle the pipe organ. To my disappointment, this SACD doesn't play through the sub, just the two front and center speaker. I knew ahead of time that it was just the three channels, but assumed the sub would kick in as well. Is this true for others with SACD multichannel?  It sounds good but it would have really been much better if I could have heard this through the sub.  3 stars, one for each of the three channels.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Excellent book giving great insight into Alzheimer's Disease from the perspective of the person that has it.  It was sad.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great storyline, interesting characters & plots & superb acting! Follow the lives of the Grantham family and their servants through historical events in history!
B00881VLCE|4.0|Love all the different subjects. All of the  4 different levels are great!!  The grand kids enjoy the easier puzzles and I like the harder ones.
B00AGH6FD8|5.0|What can I say... one of my long time favorite holiday movie. Great for family movie night and a hit with the kids
B005LN5UOC|2.0|Maybe I'm biased towards Turtle Beach's but I did want to like this. I love the fact that it was like my bluetooth for my phone. It wasn't as bulky as a Turtle Beach. Unfortunately that's all the positive I could really find with this. The sound was horrible coming through the headpiece and friends had a difficult time understanding/hearing me. You basically have to shout into it. Now why should I be shouting when game playing. With a baby in the house you buy a headset so you can play quietly. Save your money and get something else.
B00BUAEYVK|4.0|Automobiles and trucks careen.  Metal crunches.  Glass shatters.  Fire engulfs.  Bullets fly.  Blood spills. To paraphrase Billy Sol Hurok and Big Jim McBob things blow up real good .  Most touching of all is in between all the orchestrated mayhem formerly estranged father(Bruce Willis) and son(Jai Courtney) bond while dispatching bad guys.  There is a negligible plot about weapons grade uranium stashed in the ruins of Chernobyl but that's a mere distraction from watching things go BOOM. Willis still has that sly wily charm to make this a decent time filler.  That said it probably should be happy trails to this once formidable franchise.
B000I8HIV8|5.0|I watched Jumanji in school and I really liked it. My favorite part was when the crazy soldier guy says &#34;Any last words?&#34; and Alan Parrish says &#34;Jumanji!&#34;. My least favorite part was at the end when the two people find the game. I don't like that part because the drumming is really intense! I, other wise, loved the movie!
B007HJ9NBE|4.0|I thought they tweaked the story and made it better. The dancing and the music wasn't as entertaining as the first movie for me. That could be due to my age though. All and all I thought the characters were done justice and was a nice family watch.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|We were late comers to this series. First Season hooked us and we wanted to see this one. Shameful language is written in to the script but the story line is intriging and the acting is good, great chemistry!
006202406X|3.0|This is one of those books where you want to karate chop the author in the face and hug them at the same time. Painful, yes the ending was painful, but I can't always expect for an author to give me what I want. im one of those people who takes a series,a great series, personal. I fall in love with the characters, give them faces, and feel as if im inside the story as an inactive observer. because of the way I emotionally review books, this may be a bit biased, but I will try to be as honest as possible . the ending made me feel as if I wasted my time getting to know and care about the characters, not because it was sad, but because it was unnecessary. there are books where you kill important people off, and there are those where you simply scare the reader into thinking you are going to kill them and then don't. By ending the series the way she did, Veronica Roth was disloyal to her faithful readers. It didn't simply leave me sad, it left me with a bitter taste in my mouth, This is because of the way I get emotionally attached to great books, as if they belong to me. This is true about books. They don't belong to the author, but to all who bother to read and care. Roth should have kept this in mind. The book would've been relatively good if not for the way it ended. Not as legendary as the first two, because things became a little bit random, but good. When characters die at the end, and it fits, I am sad at the loss but happy with the series, But the death of this particular character seemed like a quest  to make the book 'more powerful'. As if the author was trying to compensate for some of the power missing from earlier on in the book. All I have to say is , BEWARE if you're someone who hates bad endings. This will really ruin whatever 'happy' or 'excited' feeling about the series. I don't agree with the author's 'tragic' style of writing, but I respect it. If this is the author's style, then that's ok. I now know to stay away from Veronica Roth's books. I gavethe book three stars because I don't believe it's fair for me to dismiss all of the author's hard work because of the ending.The series was still powerful, and I will remember it for  a while. The first two books save the series, and the love I developed for the characters saved this book's rating. Great read, for those who don't  mind feeling a bit depressed a little while after. ALLEGIANT. man. I know this is getting repetitive but words can't express how mad I was at the ending. Sucks. Also, the story felt bland at places. I sometimes forgot whose POV I was reading because Tris and Tobias sounded so similar. And character development was weak compared to the first two books.I was attracted to the series because of the interesting ideas presented, but the ideas in this book were more confusing than fascinating.
B005JR47R6|5.0|I hated to see the grumpy old fart leave. It was a good show, well written and an excellent ending.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I am a person who spent most of my adult life in Wyoming.  This is one of the best depictions of what Wyoming and its people are like.  Very good prose.  Good character development. Plot is excellent.  Like the way he sustained the mystery.  Great ending (or continuation).  Looking forward to reading the second book, which I have already purchased.  Like the t.v. series also, but books are always better!
B004PGO25O|5.0|Steven Pressfield is a straight shooting, kick-in-the-pants writer. His clear, no nonsense approach is a refreshing and welcome change from the field of fluffy self-affirming and so-called motivational books.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|If you haven’t read this book, you should. It's hands down the most quotable novel I have ever read. In my paperback version of it you can barely discern the print through all the cramped notes I’ve stuffed into the margins and the blobs of yellow, pink and green highlighter that take up a majority of each page.<br /><br />What? I have a highlighting system, don’t judge me.<br /><br />For those of you who don’t know the scandal-ridden history of this work of art, allow me to enlighten you. When it was first printed in 1890 by a British monthly magazine, the editors there, without the knowledge of the author, sheared off a little over 500 words from it because they thought it was “indecent”.<br /><br />It wasn’t enough.<br /><br />Victorian England was still outraged over it. Reviewers called Wilde immoral and hedonistic, and The Picture of Dorian Gray homoerotic, unclean, effeminate and contaminating.<br /><br />Needless to say, the criticism got to the author. In response to it, the book was further edited, more passages were “toned down”, deleted or re-written and six chapters were added to bring more depth to the characters and their actions in attempt to assuage the readers’ ‘delicate sensibilities’.<br /><br />It wasn’t enough. Again.<br /><br />I won’t go further into the life of the author as his story is even grimmer than that of his only published novel. Instead I’ll say this; I hope to God that mankind has moved forward enough that his tale will never be repeated. We should encourage artists and their genius, not destroy them. For how can we make any progress if we repress our innovators?<br /><br />So you see my five stars and here’s where you’re probably thinking “But what about the misogyny? Aren’t you a feminist? How can you give this book five stars when it includes quotes like this:<br /><br />&#34;I am afraid that women appreciate cruelty, downright cruelty, more than anything else. They have wonderfully primitive instincts. We have emancipated them, but they remain slaves looking for their masters, all the same. They love being dominated.&#34;<br /><br />I’ve read a lot of other reviews for this book and some people seem pretty irritated by passages like the above. I understand the irritation but let it be with the character and not the book or the author. I have Oscar Wilde’s memoirs in my library. I also have two biographies about him and have done a lot of additional research (if you couldn’t already tell). Wilde did not appear to be a misogynist. In fact, at one point he was an editor of a women’s magazine and personally edited, published and lauded several articles on feminism and women’s suffrage. The character of Lord Henry, however, is a misogynist, and I’m not arguing that. But there is brilliance in making him so disgusted by women and even though I don’t particularly enjoy it, I applaud how it was done.<br /><br />Suffice to say, this book is one of my favorites. I can’t properly review it. I just…can’t. Everything has already been said, so why add my opinion to the masses when it would only be an outpouring of fangirling? And just in case you’re curious, a few houses have recently published the unedited version of this book. I suggest you read both.<br /><br />In closing, I leave you with some of my favorite quotes:<br /><br />“…there is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.”<br /><br />“There is a fatality about all physical and intellectual distinction, the sort of fatality that seems to dog through history the faltering steps of kings.”<br /><br />&#34;Experience is merely the name men gave to their mistakes.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;Live! Live the wonderful life that is in you! Let nothing be lost upon you. Be always searching for new sensations. Be afraid of nothing.&#34;<br /><br/>&#34;What does it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul?&#34;<br /><br />&#34;All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;I can stand brute force, but brute reason is quite unbearable. There is something unfair about it's use. It is hitting below the intellect.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;Every effect that one produces gives one an enemy. To be popular one must be a mediocrity.&#34;
B005LN5UOC|4.0|This works for voice audio only with the ps3. The quality is average, but not good. With my Galaxy2 (I know it's old) this works fine. Not much to complain about. I found this earpiece was easier to get on my ear quickly when I get a call. My other one has better quality, but I can't get it on my ear fast. I leave this one in my car and it works pretty good, especially for the price.
B00DJWV11I|1.0|I am Litchick’s curiosity. When Litchick sees people spamming a book with five star reviews I make her investigate because I’m a nosy butthead.<br /><br />I am Litchick’s hesitation. When Litchick sees that the reviews are nothing but pictures of people creaming themselves followed by lists of sexy/funny quotes I make her pause to consider how these things have gone in the past.<br /><br />I am Litchick’s Id. When Litchick’s worry is about to get the best of her I override that sonofagun and click the ‘Buy Now’ button.<br /><br />I am Litchick’s fear. When the Id takes over and the self-sabotaging begins I immediately start to panic.<br /><br />I am Litchick’s optimism. I shove her fear aside with reassurances like “Maybe it’ll be different this time.” and “Everyone thinks this is funny. You like funny!”<br /><br />I am Litchick’s acceptance. I acknowledge all behaviors and encourage her to start reading.<br /><br />I am Litchick’s sense of humor. Parts of this book amuse me greatly. I urge her to keep reading.<br /><br />I am Litchick’s annoyance. I am more powerful than Litchick’s sense of humor and scissor-kick it into submission.<br /><br />I am Litchick’s left eyebrow. When the misogyny begins I climb up her forehead.<br /><br />I am Litchick’s right eyebrow. When the misogyny begins I get green with envy because I suck at arching.<br /><br />I am Litchick’s sense of self worth. I wonder why we’re still reading.<br /><br />I am Litchick’s feminism. “KILL IT WITH FIRE!!!”
B00AQO1VYY|5.0|Why DID THEY WAIT SOOO LONG TO RELEASE THIS?????????????????????????????????<br />If you remember this album from the grunge years this disc has gots tons of stuff you never saw..Great audio LANE IS AMAZING!
B0065RIJ3W|3.0|really dumbed down book, is helpful and worth the money if you don't have an internet connection and this crazy thing called &#34;google&#34;. Some decent info but seriously, look up Murray Hallem's aquaponics information. The guy is a HOOT talking about using the &#34;barbee&#34; and goes into way more depth.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|This album is UNBELIEVABLE it has so many moments that are reminiscent of their first album. Even though track 4 is clear homage to days of yor attempting to conjure the same dark spirits I'm quite certain they once did, I still love it...the bongos the groove everything. If you every loved Sabbath BUY THIS Fnn ALBUM!!
B009NF54ZE|4.0|This was one of the few hidden object games that I was able to really enjoy on my kindle Fire HD..It really had the feeling of the full HOG I played on my laptop and PC. The ONLY downfall was that there was simply way too much conversation between the characters! I had to do alot of tapping just to speed things along.. :)
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|You have to purchase more coins after only a few minutes.  It is a big rip off. I would never purchase this game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is very addictive. I am 76 years old and I play it every day. It challenges my brain.<br />I love to compare my score with my grandchildren
B00E3VTR1K|5.0|Interesting series of erotic science fiction short stories with intriguing plot and character development. We see several different themes from a futuristic prison, to a robot spouse and gender selection. Very well written reading, each story being more interesting than the one before. I am glad I picked this book up.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What's not to love. It has everything. Romance, drama, mystery I recommend it for everyone not just anglophile. Everything for everyone
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I finished this book almost 2 weeks ago and I am still thinking about it! Talk about a book hangover! I went to work and begged 2 friends to read it just so I had someone to talk about it with!  They loved it, too!  It made me laugh and cry!  Jojo Moyes did a spectacular job of making you fall in love with the characters and feel what they are feeling.  I am a book addict and have read tons of books.  Me Before You jumped up into my top 5 favorite all-time books!
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|It was like reading an Emily Bronte classic with a sexual twist to it.  Most of the time I couldn't put it down.
B00E9ZATJO|5.0|I bought this for my grandchildren. My two and a half will sit and watch so I know it's perfect
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Yes I have become a addicted to this game. Love playing this one . Don't even download unless you're ready to become a sugar addict.
B00DNO2LFC|4.0|The movie is a lovely illustration of how the power of music can be used to communicate, and or feed the soul.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I like the game but some of the levels are ridiculous but I guess that's where people are apt to buy help so it is a money maker for them.
B0076DELIG|3.0|Contained many of the elements that make Bosch such a likeable, authentic, compelling and complex character.  The relationships he develops are always so real... The storyline, however, was at times plodding... And far fetched (ie, mendenhall showing up last min to rescue him was a bit off the page for a Connelly novel).<br /><br />The writing, as always was superb, but by way of the other Bosch novels, it was not a page turner and would certainly rank in the bottom third of Connelly Bosch novels in my estimation.
B00AKKGX4W|4.0|I've read so many mediocre books lately that this one was a breath of fresh air. Ms. Milan is a talented writer. I enjoy a period romance that gives me a good sense of place and time, where the historical facts are inserted seamlessly, rather than feeling textbookish. If I have any complaint, it is that the internal dialogue was at times repetitive and went on a bit too long. But even that was well written and I did not skip over it as I usually would have. I enjoyed Robert's and Minnie's love story and plan to read Oliver's, too.<br /><br />4.5 out of 5 stars
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|This Album is awesome. I can't stop listening to it. She uses a lot of different sound effects from other bands I like (Metric, How to Destroy Angels) and this is probably the best music I've ever heard from a little 17 yr old girl.  The lyrics are a lot more clever if you listen to the whole album, rather than just individual songs. She likes to reference teeth a lot (perfect teeth is a status thing if you didn't catch on).
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|I have really enjoyed this app; however, energy points are used up quickly.  My biggest complaint is the amount of time allotted to complete each 'research' assignment. You are penalized for each incorrect item you click on, greatly reducing the time left to find the remaining items. The app continually asks if you'd like to buy additional coins or crystals, but they're much too expensive to purchase more than once or twice. My income doesn't allow me the luxury of buying these extras for every app I get.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Very well written. Characters well designed, with depth. A real page turner. Can't wait for the third volume.The discovery of the year.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Amazon Kindle Fire 5ft USB to Micro-USB Cable (works with most Micro-USB...Exactly what I ordered and received prior to the estimated derlivery day.  Will definately order from this vendor again.
B001EHDQFO|5.0|This is a well-written guide that gives us clear strategies for transforming our lives, one small step at a time.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was amazing!!!!!!! I loved it soooo much .  It has the perfect ending to the story!!<br /><br />THANK YOU SUZANNE COLLINS FOR WRITING THIS  SERIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:):):):):@:@
B009JBZH54|5.0|The trilogy is fantastic, and this item was at a fantastic price.  The quality and sound is great!  Although I don't have quite the setup that some reviews refer to, everything is straight from my TV.  But getting this AND the ultraviolet copy?  You can't beat that.
B004TI5N38|5.0|I love David Baldacci books--they have just the right amount of action and suspense.  ZeroDay did not disappoint me at all.
B006LSZECO|1.0|This novel is so overrated. I simply hated it, all smoke and mirrors. When the author is writing simply to jack me around I don't enjoy the book
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is awesome I like the competition s they r fun and I enjoy. Taking care of my horses and playing with them.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|One of the most unique and disturbing criminal trial books I've ever read. The ending stayed with me for days after finishing the novel.  It is a total page turner.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Absolute page turner!<br />Definitely recommend reading this series of books. You won't want to put it down. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|It was okay, certainly not one of Grisham's best works. The characters were not sympathetic and the storyline not very compelling
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book is dynamic. Card includes social commentary about society and child soldiers while still remaining true to the stories plot. The characters are well thought out and develop over time instead of remaining stagnant or one-dimensional. The ending is a shocker, sure to surprise readers. Card ends the book on a hopeful note, while leaving room to expand the &#34;Ender universe&#34;.
1603427244|4.0|I must admit, I've been one of those &#34;lazy&#34; knitters who use the same bind-off and cast off techniques for most of my knit projects, year after year. But after getting this book, I've been expanding on my finishing techniques, thanks to the easy to understand instructions and PHOTOS (not hard- to- fathom diagrams, love it) provided in this knitting reference book.<br /><br /> Spiral bound so it stays flat at the page you're using too, I like that too.<br /><br /> As it says on the cover: this book really does provide: the perfect start and finish for every knitting project.
B001SGEUME|5.0|Love it, really love it. Every song makes me alive. If you want to know what rock n roll really is, buy and listen to this album. Really recommended.
B00BHBBSZ2|3.0|functions are pretty self explanatory but there are no directions to explain  everything the pad can do.  Instead, you have to sit and play with it to see how different functions and boxes work - still haven't figured out the box that keeps popping up in the middle of the page ... I'm sure it has something to do with inserting - will get to it first chance I get (would rather have just read the directions)  also wish there was a way to  make the writing  on the finished page a little darker so it would be easier to see.  That aside, it's kind of fun and  I like it better than having to use the keyboard.
B00F91SCXC|2.0|Wow you may not like what I got to say about this one. I read the book and couldn't figure out how they would make a movie out of it. Obviously they couldn't. Sorry I should have listened to my friends, (9out of 10) didn't like the movie. It was just okay to me. Tho I love zombies.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|Pretty addictive game.  Great graphics...decent sound...a lot of replay value.<br /><br />Easy controls yet it soon gets very reasonably challenging.  Glad I got it on both my first generation Kindle and my kindle HD.
140006922X|5.0|This is not the first book I've read dealing with the historical Jesus (In particular works by authors John Dominic Crossan and Bart D. Ehrman) so there were few surprises. This is, however, the best and most concise treatment of the topic that I have seen.  I am especially thankful for the story of what happened after Jesus' execution for sedition in regards to the two faces of the future church as developed under the differing visions of James and Paul and that says a lot about where the church is today, at least up to the current Pope. Pope Francis seems about ready to trash the Pauline doctrines, which, in my opinion set the Church upon the wrong track for nearly 2000 years.  At least he sounds a lot more like James than Paul.<br />To summarize, I feel like Dr. Aslan has finally produced a comprehensive and complete version of the events that took place in that time and place and he has successfully unveiled the real Jesus.
B000KIRT6A|3.0|Its ok.  It does what it says, but if youre using more than one other pedal you get a loud white noise in the background.
B00F35B8F8|4.0|Excellent movie, Good action and special effects. The attempt to match the looks of Spock, Doc etc was a little distracting.
B000SJJCX4|5.0|Quick and accurate.  I also like to use the bypass mode as a standby switch for changing guitars.  Doesnt register notes well with both pickups engaged though.
B00GLX0Z8C|5.0|One of the funniest shows of the year.  Just raw humor and slapstick.  A lot of comedy scenes that kept me in stiches.  Loved it and highly recommend it for adults, a little rough for under 16.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|I didn't know of Bourdain before his Travel Channel show, and upon reading this book I like the man even more.  The background that got him to be the traveling connoisseur of food that he is, well, let's just say it is every bit as interesting as I imagined.

B00BATG18K|2.0|I was disappointed. I've read her other books and found them to be more enjoyable. I found Violet unable to like and I've read other books with the same theme.
1451666179|5.0|This book is funny!  You must read it!  Allie Brosh is a genius!  Yes, I'm using a lot of exclamation points on purpose!  The simple drawings are so expressive and the material just &#34;hits home&#34; on an honest, humorous level.  I highly recommend the book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad they have it available for the Kindle!!  A great game to just sit and play for a while.  Love it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is fun and challenging.  The higher in level you reach the harder it is to reach the next level but I really enjoy it and I think anyone who loves puzzle games will really like this one.
B00846REIS|5.0|If you have read \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" you will love this book. I can't wait to read the other two books in this trilogy.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|I watched the trailer and was expecting more.  It's an okay popcorn movie but wasn't as good as I'd hoped it would be.  The characters are pretty shallow and the ending is stupid
B00G32VYDG|3.0|The plot isn't that bad, but man, the effects are awful, the lines are super corny & the chemistry  between Bridges & Reynolds is oil & water.  Wait to see it on a flight - if it's free.  3 stars because I like Kevin Bacon & Mary-Louise Parker, and they made it bearable.
B00AR5AMBU|5.0|Still the best of the four Rambo movies.  I hadn't seen it in years and watched it with my son who had only heard of Rambo.  The acting isn't great but the action makes up for that.
B008JFUPOY|5.0|Great movie!! Love all the characters, and my grand kids loved it! :-)<br />I'm very glad I bought this movie.
B001Q7JD3Q|5.0|I'd seen the theater version years ago and must say the extended cut is much better.  Several scenes in this version didn't appear in the theater released one and they contribute more to the plot by developing deeper character depth.
B0041B4B8G|5.0|Pre-order the Rich Mahogany Edition to get the original theatrical release on Blu-ray for the first time ever!  Finallyyyyy no dealing with the dumb unrated edition.
B003UAMWWQ|1.0|I thought I'd give Mel Brooks one more try and was greatly disappointed.  Brooks really hasn't had an original idea since Blazing Saddles as this movie, like most of his since, have the same old tired gags and jokes over and over.
B00CHVIPP2|5.0|This is one of the best animated movies in a long time. Very funny. My whole family really enjoyed this one.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Great suspenseful movie with unexpected plot twists that add to the entertainment.  Excellent casting adds to the enjoyment.  I recommend.
B00GH4R95C|4.0|This one surprised me. It was much better then I was expecting it to be. I enjoyed the background story that this movie told. I look forward to see what they do as a sequel.
B000SW2F6M|5.0|I haven't studied the crusades much but this film intrigued me.  One can't help but come away a bit contemplative about what the world would be like if extremists in all religions adopted a more reasonable tone of coexistence.  Some great battle scenes but also graphic violence.
0395389496|4.0|This is a great book. If you have seen the movie before reading the book, realize that there are quite a few differences. But this makes a great read as a family.
B004HX0P2Y|5.0|Watched it on a whim and was blown away.  This is one fun action flick and the casting is outstanding.  It's hilarious in some scenes and action packed in others.  I heard a sequel is coming and I can't wait.
B00G32VYDG|4.0|This was really funny. The actors really make this movie. Ryan Reynolds does a great job, but Jeff Bridges really steals the show. another greay job of charecter acting by Bridges.
B0006AAS5G|1.0|These watches are good looking, but they have funtion problems. Particularly with the second hand. This is the second Invicta that I purchased and although they were in a reduced price, I got a better life time from a cheaper Timex...\\"What is a watch that does not work after a few months\\" pretty junk.<br /><br />Will not by Invicta again.<br /><br />Just spoke to Invicta customer service. They stated that in order for them to fix the watch,  you need to send them $25 for shipping and handling and it will take approximately 90 to return being that it is shipped to China for repairs. So much for the Japan Swiss they clamed to be. LOL

0345807952|4.0|Bridget Jones is back with a bang! Now in her 50s, Bridget still packs a lot of power.<br /><br />The story begins when Bridget is a widow and a single mom to her two kids. She has lost Darcy to an accident about four years back and has finally accepted her life as it is without him. Now on the look out to get back to the dating scene and find herself a new lover, Bridget takes on a new adventure. Her friends are still there and still the same.<br /><br />I have always loved Bridget Jones because she is not perfect. She is a little bit on the heavier side when it comes to her body, she is insecure and very much clumsy – and that is exactly what we all are – imperfect in some way or the other. It makes it so much easier to connect to characters that are true to life and easier to relate to. In this third installment, Helen Fielding has kept Bridget true to her nature. Worrying about how her love life may affect her children, trying to catch up to the latest trends and all the insecurities that come after losing your partner of over a decade. At the same time we also realize that she has matured over the years, as we see her interacting with her kids, while staying true to her essence. Yeah well, I think I can go on about Bridget for pages. So let us just move on to the next point – the plot. It is simple yet the journey is as unexpected as it is Bridget on the driving seat. I love Helen’s sense of humour and comic timing… The book will make you laugh throughout and even at odd situations.<br /><br />I know for a fact that a lot of Bridget Jones fans are mad about Darcy being killed off… But then from the very beginning it has been Bridget’s story. Not Bridget and Mark’s story – but just Bridget’s story. And so the story continues even with him gone and that should slowly sink in as Bridget continues toiling through her life.<br /><br />Awesome book… A must read for all Bridget Jones and Chic-lit Fans.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|There is a glitch that should be fixed. If you complete 1 of the final 3  objectives then go into the running part of the game and if you press pause you still keep going and if you press save me then you can use save me,s anywhere for 1 gem unless you wait to die.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|This application is fantastic. Especially for people who enjoy reading and receiving book in seconds rather than waiting for a very long time to get physical books.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|As a new player to MTG I wasn't sure what to expect from this, but after playing for an hour or two I can say THIS IS AWESOME!This game teaches you how to play and you can pick it up in about 10 minutes of you really want to learn. The expansion pack, while originally seeming expensive, was worth every penny! I highly recommend this app, for new and old players alike, and I also highly recommend the expansion!
B00DURHYWC|5.0|This is another great musical offering from the Pink Martini group.  I enjoy hearing both China Forbes and Storm Large, particularly on their duet.  Fabulous and worth checking out the YouTube video!
B006AN78XS|5.0|From beginning to end, this movie is an absolute joy. Part fantasy, party romantic comedy, and all parts good, Woody Allen directs a masterpiece that I've watched several times. Those more literate viewers will appreciate the references and wit from characters including Ernest Hemingway, Dal&iacute;, and Bu&ntilde;uel, among others who populate this piece. Owen Wilson rises above to embody the essential Allen angst in ways I never thought possible. Wilson delivers a performance that I can't imagine anyone else giving. Essentially, the plot revolves around Wilson and his fianc&eacute; in Paris, tagging along with her parents who are on a business trip, and weird things ensue when Wilson's character takes a ride into the past to meet his literary heroes. Although Wilson's character is successful at writing screenplays, he's struggling with a novel. He learns life lessons in various visits to the past where he encounters the aforementioned literary and artistic giants, all of whom have something to say in outrageously entertaining fashion. Furthermore, the &#34;look&#34; of this film is pure eye candy, a saturated glow to the past and a crisp look at the present will resonate after many viewings. Amazingly, I'm no fan of Woody Allen, but this movie really delivers, A perfectly paced, brilliantly acted, and finely directed piece of story telling. Buy it for your library and watch it often.
1401201911|4.0|Who is the most dyed in the wool, patriotic, all American that you can think of? George Washington? Patton? Chuck Norris? Let me offer a suggestion, what about Superman? (I know I set you guys up for failure on that one since technically he's not real and technically he's a space alien but the point still stands). For being an alien and not real, Superman is an iconic American. But what if he wasn't?<br /><br />In  the graphic novel &#34;Red Son&#34; the Superman legend is turned on it's head. Superman landed in Ukraine instead of the United States and when he grows up he goes to Moscow to be Stalin's right hand man. Though he is Papa Stalin's best boy Superman tries to always do what he feels is best and is necessary, not just what is according to Party lines. (Like, he saves Americans when they need saving. Even though they are capitalist monsters).<br /><br />In America, Lex Luthor is a mad science genius whose lady love is Lois Lane.The CIA hires him to find a way to destroy this Soviet threat. He makes several different monsters/super hero type things to go up against Superman but it's all for naught.Beating Superman becomes his obsession into which he pours all of his energy and pretty much abandons Lois, who is still a reporter at the Daily Planet.<br /><br />Another of Superman's enemies is Batmankoff, who is a bomb happy anarchist. (He wears one of those fuzzy ear flap hats over his Batman mask and bat ear thing and it's Adorable even though I don't think that it's supposed to be.) Another familiar face is Wonder Woman. She's a princess from some idyllic paradise that has no need for men (...) and she's Superman's little comrade in crime and she harbors a long standing crush on Superman that even with all of his superpowers he still is too blind to see. (He still is a man after all).<br /><br />There's huge battles, unrequited love, betrayals, KGB, America in turmoil, and a twist ending. Kind of everything you want in an action packed story, right?<br /><br/>I am a newbie to the graphic novel genre, and am pretty unfamiliar with the Superman canon but I really enjoyed this little tale, I give it 3 and a half stars out of 5. I have always been interested in Russia's turbulent history, especially during it's time in Communism's stranglehold which I think helped. I really wish they would have called him Supercomrade though.I liked the artwork. It was all very much in the style of Russian propaganda of the past, which kept with the continuity of the idea and the overall feel of the story.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|My best book friend....Kindle is on every device that I own.  Never have to worry about leaving my book at home.  I can read anytime and anywhere that I want.  I can adjust it to my reading preference as well (light, dark, big, little).  I love the fact that I don't have to actually &#34;save and keep&#34; every book on my devices, although you can see your full library at anytime even when you have removed it from your device.  SOOOOO....you can read your books without hogging up all of your device's memory.  I also love the fact that when I order books it downloads super fast.
B00002SWEM|1.0|I thought this dvd was the unedited version of the documentary which aired on pbs in the late nineties.  It was not.  It was instead an assortment of splices from the original with an annoying back and forth from the great musicians at home in Cuba to their appearances in the Amsterdam concert.  The music was interrupted over and over in order to accomplish this oscillation such that you never got to hear a full piece.  What a butchery!  Where is the original?  An especially moving scene, which is missing in the present diced up thing, is a view of the twin towers from the plane window as the great musicians were in a glide path to land in New York.  Editor, whoever you are, couldn't you let us see the twin towers just one more time just as the elderly and great Cubans saw them from their plane?
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I think it is a good game the graphics are awesome and very realistic you should give out glu credits for getting two kills for one shot
1593275080|5.0|No Starch Press is on a roll with its series of Lego themed books. While most of them are about model ideas or construction techniques,  Beautiful Lego is different.  This is a Lego art book. In classic coffee table style it is filled with gorgeous photos to thrill the reader. Beautiful Lego does not seek to discuss 'can Lego be art', but takes it as fact. These are works by artists, just artists using the medium of Lego instead of paint or clay, and the results speak for themselves. Stunning.<br /><br />Beautiful Lego is written and photographed by Mike Doyle, a lego artist himself as well as an excellent graphic designer, but features the work of over 70 different artists. The book is organized by topic -- spaceships, people, architecture, robots -- with interviews of artists interspersed.  Each artist is asked the single question: &#34;Why Lego?&#34;; with an immense variety of answers. There is a common theme, though: the desire to create using an incredibly malleable medium.<br /><br />Some models are beautiful and some are terrifying, such as &#34;The Doll&#34; (pg 5) and &#34;Disscected Frog&#34; (pg 79).  The architectural models really shine; good use of the few curvy pieces in Lego can make amazing results. There is even political art: The Power of Freedom (page 124).<br /><br />Beautiful Lego surprised me by the diversity of styles within the medium of Lego. Some are hyper detailed, some expressive, some minimalist.  Angus MacLane has a cute style known in the book as CubeDudes, which are head on caricatures of famous figures like President Lincoln, Kirk and Spock, and the Stay Puft Marshmellow Man. (page 36)<br /><br />You will appreciate the book on two levels. First, the beauty or expression of the piece, then a second time as you pour over the photos trying to figure out &#34;How did they do that with Lego?&#34;  Mike Doyle's victorian house series in particular will amaze you with the flexibility of Lego. (And make you wonder how big his Lego collection is:) While re-reading the book for this review, I'm struck by how much good photography makes a difference when experiencing a model.<br /><br />I heartily recommend Beautiful Lego to the adult Lego fan in your life. It just might make you pull out the bin from the garage and build a few orignal models yourself.  And yes, there is a Freddy Mercury model called Fried Chicken.
B0058DRSHW|5.0|Great book for someone wanting to start a company amd make it visionary. I like how they explain all their research findings and put it all together to show the importance of establishing your companies core values. Overall great read.

B008JD7VZM|2.0|400 pieces and $50 !!  This is the size of a little tissue box. I was expecting something much larger and more value. I am almost embarrased to wrap it and give it as a gift.
B00BAXFECK|1.0|Possibly the longest most tedious book I have ever read and I have read many.  I found myself skimming a good part of the book and only read it as one of my friends recommended it.  Examining each thought that the main character had, delving into each dream and experience he had ever had, became just a long boring book.  The basic premise and story line could have been good if it was about 300 pages shorter.
B00EI4V3X2|1.0|DO NOT BUY! Will never buy turtle beach's that use wifi tech they never ever pair and your left with something that looks amazing but doesnt work..

B0060AY6FO|5.0|This continuing of the lives of those glorious families introduced in Jane Austin's PRIDE and PREJUDICE seamlessly told by P.D. James is like reading the original author's writing.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it! I use it all the time. I prefer to put it on audio. The accent will keep you listening.
B0089AD8IO|2.0|There is a problem with the sound. I have to turn up my tv volume to max to hear the DVD.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Despicable me is the best game ever because you never get bored of it. There is always a great way you can update your game. Also, the minions are so cute in all their different costumes. The excitement in this game just keeps building up as you try to become minion of the year. This game is great for all ages. You even earn different places to run in. Overall, I think everyone would love this game. LOVE IT.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been  playing a couple of games that are similar to this and have not been as satisfied. There is no comparison the this game.  It becomes very addictive if you aren't careful.
B000LC55F2|5.0|The storyline was great.  Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale were intense and brillant in their performance.  Great magic performances by both
B00GLX1MG6|5.0|Funny but the ending sucked expect the very last scean but over all good coukd of used some boobage and could been longer
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|GREAT That they have added this game loved it on Facebook but it stated locking up. I stop playing because of that issue.
B008JFUPOY|5.0|Great quality Bluray.  Meets my expectations of Pixar quality in both content and quality.  Nice to get the DVD too, which Australia missed out on (BR+DVD pack).
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Bought this for my 7yo's birthday as she had been asking for it for almost a year since her grandma got it and she fell in love with it. She loves all the signing in it.

1416550542|5.0|This book is very enjoyable reading.  I like to read all kinds of books and this one is definitely a good story.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It works essentially as advertised. The only major issue is that computer has to be connected via WiFi, this goes counter to what the page advertises. \\"Easy setup: Plug into any HDTV and connect to your home WiFi network.\\" I see no reason why the Chromecast can't handle streaming video from any computer connected to the network. This doesn't really affect those who use tablets, smart phones, and most (if not all) laptops. But for desktop users who would more likely have only a wired connection and not have a WLAN adapter this would be a problem. If you can do it with a computer remote phone app, I don't see why Google couldn't figure it out. As it stands the Chromecast program for your computer is just a glorified configuration manager. Using it like a server app or as an A/V broadcaster would be great.<br /><br />With that in mind it does as advertised, it works, and it's relatively simple to set up. It's in no way a game changer, if it could stream the video output from your computer like you would by plugging in an HDMI cable into your monitor or TV then it'd be a great device. We can only hope that Google does an update to it's Chromecast program that enables this.<br /><br />*****EDIT: After some more tinkering I am partially wrong. The Chrome browser extension has an \\"experimental\\" share screen feature. This will share your screen but it will not share audio. Also, once the browser extension has been connected via WiFi you can disconnect from that and then use your normal wired connection. The Chromecast program still requires the WiFi connection on start up, but once it's started it will be fine with the wired connection. It looks like the Chromecast extension in Chrome is in \\"Beta\\" so hopefully some better progress there. You will STILL need a wireless connection from your computer initially it seems, but you can get a cheap $10 - $20 wireless adapter thumbdrive easy. If I can I'll be updating this from 3 to 4 stars, but my initial assessment is still the same. This is not a game changer.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I've never been disappointed when I read a John Grisham book, ever!!!  I can't wait for his next book to come out.
B006CUDDUG|4.0|Not sure what to make of this top 10  mystery of all time I might have to read it again to fully appreciate it. But if \\"they\\" say it's that good,it must be.
B0084AZXKK|4.0|Bought this to read with my 8 year old daughter but she wasn't into it.  I kept reading though and loved it.  Little hard to follow the pirate talk but still very enjoyable.
B009K45Y62|3.0|The movie series itself is fantastic, and I absolutely love it.<br />But when my copy arrived it was badly beaten and damaged. The outside box itself was in perfect condition.<br />But the box containing everything for display had been shattered, covered in scratches, dirt and foot prints. On one side it looks like it had been kicked in, or across a floor by the toe of a boot.<br />I returned it immediately and got the lower cost Blu-Ray trilogy version.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This can be very addicting but fun.  Bright colors simple shapes,  I like that I can take my time on most levels to figure things out.  Be careful of how many moved you have left.

B00BATG18K|4.0|engrossing and a good study about mixed race cultures in other countries…a reminder that the united state is not the only county infested with frightened bigots.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I found it difficult to follow at times but that may not be a problem for most.<br />The actors did a great job in their respective portrayals of the characters.<br />One tip (not a spoiler) watch through the credits.
B000PC0S5K|5.0|WOW amazingly inspirational!  I recommend this to anyone who depends on others for happiness.  This is a must read for everyone.
B00BGI08GG|1.0|Wow, I haven't seen TV this bad in a long time. Every aspect of the story line is spoon fed to you. There is no story development, there is no acting out anything. The Hero is lonely; you know this because every supporting actor walks up to him and tells you. The people around him are frustrated with him lying to them. So there is four different conversations about him. The scenes flash through the show so fast portraying quick fits of bad acting. Just really bad.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I couldn't put it down! This book keeps you interested from the moment you start reading. The author does an impeccable job intertwining relationships and families while staying focused on the underlying theme.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This was one of the better John Grisham books, I thought it had a brilliant history of people and story. Finished it in record time because I had a hard time putting the book down.
B0000714B5|4.0|As a Buddhist and a fan of the book this film was very well done.<br /><br />As a Buddhist (poverty vows), I can not purchase the DVD.<br /><br />But as a fan of Mr. Hesse's novel, I can purchase the DVD with a wheelbarrow of German money.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great series of books, that will keep reader wanting to finish series, just to find out what it is all about...
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Cool for kids and lots of fun to see what is going to happen next in the book. So cool!!!!!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|finally on my kindle! thank you, thank you, thank you! the best game ever, life is good....sad but true lol
0345803493|5.0|Not quite a juicy as the first one, but more of a storyline.  I appreciated their being more of a story than just sex.
B008X8P8A8|5.0|Great action strategy game with building placement, resource gathering, troops selection and placement and tactical movements. Eye catching Japanese medieval ambient and great sounds and music. It has a campaign mode with dozens of battles and six skirmish battles all payable against a challenging AI at the higher levels. By completing the battles upgrades become available. They can also be purchased at the store but there is no need to spend additional dollars, it is possible to earn all the badges offered by the game with the game purchase only. Overall outstanding value!
0345803507|5.0|What can you say, you've already read the first two, it's a no brainer you have to read book #3 to find out the ending.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|It would be better if there was a kindle fire specific app. Font is too small & difficult to read.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|I find this game very fun and addicting it has the perfect combo of challenge and fun. It is very much like the pc, xbox, and PS platforms and I love it I would recomend this game to any one who likes sandbox games and such
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addicting. I think the creepy music does something subliminally to your brain. I hear the music in my dreams. LOL
B00EDLP6O2|5.0|This game is cool and you punch through your career. Get those 99 cents or coins and buy this game!FREAKING AWESOME!
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|I really enjoyed this rendition of Superman. For those that say that it did not stay true to the Superman legacy I think are wrong. I think it was high time to update this story line to modern age. I thought that showing his humanity, his ups and downs, doubts and fears made this very refreshing. Well done. Loved it.
B000LB7G00|5.0|I'm a design engineer. I think it's an amazing mouse. I feel more freedom while making design and all motions.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Me personally I have never ever played this game. I have heard of this game but never really played it. Then I saw it in the App store for kindle fire HD so I was like looks interesting. Sure it took a long time to download but when it finally did I couldn't put it down. With this game I feel like I can really express myself I feel like I rule the world. This is that type of game where it makes you feel creative like your the king/queen of the world. It's worth the money (sometimes you can EARN kindle points that are used to buy games that cost cash hint hint)(- -)<br />  \[  ]/<br />  &yen;&yen;
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|Great collection for any Eagles fan, lots of information on a classic American band. Some say it is the Don and Glenn show but I have no complaints. Contains profanity, nudity and alcohol/drug use
1451629192|5.0|It was an awesome read, Jaycee did a great job writing her own thoughts and memories. Most would not survive the hell she went through.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|Saw this concert live from Albuquerque, NM. Great concert live, great concert in HD from home! Must have for Eagles fans! Sound quality, and visuals are great!
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|It’s been a while since I read a Baldacci book and having read this book, I regret the long absence. Mr. Baldacci has a great way of ramping up the tension, teasing you with information (chapter breaks are things of horror with him – he’s FABULOUS at the cliffhangers), and throwing in humor when you least expect it.<br /><br />As memory serves, I read the first book in this particular series a while back. I certainly remember the Secret Service issue with Michelle. But other than that, I haven’t read anything in this series. That didn’t cause a problem because while there are occasional references (and in Edgar’s case, a LOT of references) to past cases, they aren’t really necessary to follow the plot (though I want to go back and read the book where they helped Edgar – read the book to learn more about Edgar).<br /><br />Sean and Michelle are definitely trying to work through the early stages of a relationship. There’s passion there (but not on the screen – yay!), but they’re also two very distinctive individuals with very different ways of handling things. I love Michelle’s messiness and Sean’s exasperation with her (and frequent comments about the state of her truck’s interior).<br /><br />The mystery as to what cargo was being moved by Sam Wingo kept me reading, and then when it was revealed what he’d been transporting and why, wow. Definitely had to see how it played out. I was also really curious as to why the villain was doing what he was doing (along with WTH was he plotting).<br /><br />Kudos to Mr. Baldacci for the Jaws reference and having Sean be a bit embarrassed that he used Jaws to get an idea on how to save Michelle (nope, not giving any more details than that).<br /><br />The conclusion of this book was very suspenseful. I loved how Michelle and Sean, despite frequently getting into danger, kept level heads about themselves and worked through the problem. Even when their own client wanted to fire them, they didn’t just take it at face value and walk away. Instead, they continued investigating (trying to be subtle about it, but when the NSA is involved, there isn’t a lot of subtlety, considering how much the NSA and other governmental agencies can spy on the average people, especially when trying to cover up an incident).<br /><br />So, unreserved 5-star rating from me for this book! I am soooo going to find more of the series to read now.<br /><br />Book provided by NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.t take it at face value and walk away.

B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I don't hunt in real life so this is the way for me to enjoy the sport thank you very much
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Fantastic product that is always reliable, almost never buffers, and it was super cheap!<br /><br />Setup was a snap, and once it's done, you'll never need the Chromecast app again, just open Netflix or YouTube and click the Chromecast button, and you're done.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Don't get me wrong it was very well written,  i just like a book that I am not crying every single chapter.  Very well written.
B00DSLZCR4|5.0|I will never tire of Brosh's incredible humorous insight into humans and how we interact with the world and its creatures.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|A great finish to an interesting sordid love story, i could put them down once i started to read fifty shades of grey
B005PW3OS8|3.0|Love the opening scenes, but gets a little too much cliche, even for a comic book later in the movie.
B00EGMQIJ0|2.0|Unrealistic view of technology that did not deal with any nuances of technology. Parable would have been more realistic if he had characters than understood the risks of technology and played the pro/cons more evenly before action. In addition, the main character was very naive and the metaphors overly obvious.<br /><br />Interesting ideas and a great subject matter...just thought it lacked the execution to make it realistic and nuanced
0790731452|5.0|just another great old movie that our family loves. funny, crazy and enjoyable..never thought we would find it. thanks, amazon!
1609611543|5.0|this book put me on the road to a gluten free diet..by choice...i've never looked back...now i'm trying to get others in the family to do the same. aches and pains have largely disappeared and lost 11lbs....
B000FIMG68|5.0|Daughter-in-law loves Lost...finished her collection . I have never seen it myself but she was quite happy and that's all that matters.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is addictive graphics are good and it keeps my daughter amused for hours I would recommend download good game
B00BAXFECK|2.0|I'm sorry, but I have to agree with those that say this book needed editing.  There are just too many long, rambling &#34;philosophical&#34; passages as well as repetitive, boring descriptions of depression and drug use.  This book had the potential to be great (the first two thirds are very good) but I grew so impatient by the end that it was ruined for me.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book got me hooked in the very beginning it might seem boring but just kelp reading  it was exciting
B000BGR0OM|5.0|Not quite as &#34;Ultimate&#34; as it should be since there are no cuts from In the Garden, the 1984 soundtracks or We Too Are One included, but, overall, no one can really beat the amazing catalog of work Eurythmics produced.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Very good game , graphics are a 3 star rating and the sensitivity is like a 4 star rating. This game is a great game u will need to survive by building a house get a farm for food mine for armor and u can on creative build way ever and go to a SERVER and have 1 too! I think it's great game.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This is a kind of science fiction effort.  No reader who likes to think cogently will be able to accept the substance of the story.  BUT it is really well written!
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|Nice option for my kindle but wouldn't want to type an essay on it. Cost wasn't bad for what u get.
B00E9ZATJO|5.0|This movie has a lot of heart in it and it set the stage for the first movie. Good Job Pixar!
B00005QDW1|5.0|Always been a fan of no doubt. I love the album. No defects at all. Was just like I bought it from the store. Thank you
B0001HAISG|4.0|I love the movie. There were no defects and it played just as if we bought it from a regular store.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love this game, but not happy that the update for the kindle fire has not come yet. Kindle only goes to level 440 I'm past that. When is the update coming, much easier to carry around my kindle then a laptop
1451666179|5.0|I would have loved to give 6 stars to this book, or even 333 stars! This book is AMAZING! This book is my reassuring teddy bear, this book is my best friend, this book is my vitamin supplement. It is cute, funny, cleaver, intelligent, cleaver, smart, cleaver, fun,with colors! I want to read it 50 times... and I will. Anyway, you should buy it and if you don't like it then I don't like YOU! Definitely in my top 3 best books ever. 8D
B00AREIAI8|5.0|fun and entertaining I could sit down for a good amount of time. but the down side is that there are toooooo many controls to handle
B009ZQFSRA|2.0|Just an ok movie. Really didn't even see it to the finish. Maybe it would have gotten better if I saw it to the end but I doubt it.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|The development of and evolved relationships between the characters is excellent.  It's adds a lot to have seen the prequel movies.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Although you would probably enjoy this book even if you haven't read The Shining first,I would recommend that you do.That being said..character development is amazing in this book, so you will definitely be able to figure out what's going on.Once again I find myself not able to put this book down.He is masterful at storytelling, and makes you continue to wonder what's going to happen next.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Very fun game... try it you'll probably most likely like it! SO satisfying when you gobble up a scuba diver that tries to shank you or comes at you with a speargun... go get you some!
B00GLX1MG6|4.0|Actually a really funny movie. I was surprised as I am not usually a fan of Jennifer Aniston, bu yea I would recommend this movie.
B00GLP47UM|5.0|Disney Musical Magic!<br /><br />When I first found out about &#34;Frozen&#34; I was very hopeful that a solid score would come with it. I was more excited when I found out this was to be an album not just of score tracks but with vocal performances as well.<br /><br />I pre-ordered the album and have been listening through it again and again over the last several days and my hopes regarding the quality of the music here have been realized.<br /><br />The songs are spectacular and the score is moving as well.<br /><br />There are so many emotions in the vocal tracks - these are the real substance of the soundtrack, and the instrumental score references the vocal numbers from time to time.<br /><br />I don't feel to write any lengthy description of the tracks - just know if you want a solid orchestral score with even more solid vocal numbers then this will be an excellent addition to your collection.<br /><br />The song &#34;Let It Go&#34; (the Idina Menzel version, not the Demi Lovato imitation) is so incredibly powerful and passionately sung - it's the real stand-out track of the album...that being said, all the vocal tracks are stirring, entertaining, humorous, exciting, and sad in their turn.<br /><br />There's a lot of substance here.<br /><br />I am a fan of the score to Disney's &#34;Tangled&#34;, but this one is deeper in the instrumental tracks and in the vocal performances - more meaningful overall, and that makes for a far more enjoyable listening experience; give this score a listen and find out for yourself!
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|The graphics are nice but too nice, screens take too long to load and when i played the first board a few times and went to uninstall it, it was taking up over 100 MB!!!! nooooo thank you!!!!!
B001NA6096|5.0|Part one of a trilogy I have seen only recently. Very real and moving. First movie a little bit to sweet but it is also because of the age of the characters. Very sweet.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|Will be buying this for Xmas gifts.  A great read and one I know I will revisit.<br />I especially loved her dog chapters.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|lots of fun easy to play,  realistic. animals with realistic guns and modes make it very fun.  no need to spend money which will keep me playing
0399230033|4.0|My grandson (20 months)  likes this book. It has thick pages easy for him to turn. It doesn't have many words but you follow the story visually.
B00BPDR3F6|2.0|Difficult to get through because too much detail on non-essential things to the real story!  The real story itself was good.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love the work Suzanne Collins does with touching the hearts and minds of readers of all ages. I found mocking jay to be touching, fearful, and sad. This is truly the greatest book ever written in the entire world.
B00BUVPIRS|5.0|This is the best game ever and they fixed all the bugs and I love the awesome ragdoll effects and that you can pickpocket people. But you should make it that you can kill random people or make it when you aim your bow you can move it.
B00GLX1MG6|5.0|Hilariously funny!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Really good actors and movie plot. I love this movie. You should totally see it. You won't regret it.
B00GO95TAC|5.0|A fitting capstone to the first 50 years of the Doctor, The Day of the Doctor just got it perfectly right. Story, dialogue, snarky attitudes, and all the references and inside jokes to so many of the Doctors left me shrieking with glee at the screen.  As a post script, ignore the complaints about pricing, I very much suspect that Amazon is not the one responsible for setting price, and quite frankly the difference between $2.99 vs $7.99 is barely enough to get a decent cup of coffee....and you will be able to enjoy THIS many, many times as opposed to the coffee which you really only ummm, &#34;rent&#34; once.
B005MMY5RK|5.0|Really great. Perhaps the best ever. Technically, it is superb, but also a great story...tragedy broken up into multiple fragments.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I was so excited to read this book. I read Divergent and Insurgent, but this book just took away all my joy. Seriously? How can you kill off your main character? Was it needed?  First of all, Tris dies. Like what? I understood why you did that, for the love of her brother and for the forgiveness of him. Also, because in Divergent and Insurgent Tris always risks near death experiences and you believe that you should close off the novel with Tris actually dying. Seriously? I put my all into this book and  wasted my money and my time reading it. For example, you should have added a twist where Tris sacrifices herself to save her brother and then Upon reaching the weapons lab and held at gunpoint bu David Caleb, the coward he is, should have saved Tris life. He should have come up and taken the bullet for his sister. Let him sacrifice an  redeem himself. Anyways you can end the book any way you want I don't have a say just to think about your readers and your career before you think to write or if you ever write again.<br />Also, I would like to point out that in the Hunger Games- I don't want to compare because there are both two different books but I have to to show an example- Suzanne Collins did not kill off he  Main character, which is a stupid act, she killed the sister of the main character and  described it well. She is a very great author and that is what you expect from one not one that kills the main character that the whole trilogy is based on. How can you expect a movie to be made from this? It will not get any views for it will be stupid<br />This book is alright I really do love the lovescenes between Tris and  Tobias and I enjoyed Tobias perspective of things throughout the book. I always wanted to know what Tobias was thinking.<br />Really great book, a little too lazy in some parts but need to fix the ending
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Works great for me. No guesswork.  Just a quick glance tells me when to charge the battery. You cant go wrong with this Free App.
B00632HWOG|3.0|Recent 'improvements' in Yahoo Mail have made it, for me, harder to use, particularly when I try to scroll through recent E-mails. Somehow, for me, it is far more laborious, time-consuming and unpredictable than it was a year or two ago. Also, I used to find it simple to find old E-mails from my contacts, even ones from five or more years ago. Now it is almost impossible. When I try to see E-mails from just one person, instead I am supplied with E-mails from dozens of people. I cannot understand why all these changes were made, which, for me, have turned a fast, practical, easy to use website into a slow and cumbersome one.
B00C5W3SBE|1.0|Terrible, mean spirited, awful.  Please don't be fooled into believing that this is a worthy successor to &#34;The Wizard of Oz.&#34;  This is a cgi laden disaster.  James Franco's acting ranges between a grimace and a smile and that's it.  The are no characters to care about. The movie's version of humor involves a bigger character hitting a smaller character.  After all these years and all the resources Disney had at its disposal, it is so disappointing that this is what they came up with. Don't waste your time with this and please don't let your kids watch it!
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|This book is a quick read, with a bit of humor. Nothing very informative or enlightening, but was reasonably enjoyable.
B00006LLOG|4.0|I was such a Lou Reed fan back in the day, you wouldn't believe.  I was broken hearted when the Velvets brokw up, just when they COULD have had a hit album. (No question that LOADED could have charted much higher if the group had already disbanded prior to its release).  For a while it wasn't even clear that Lou Reed would have any kind of solo career.  For a while, he was doing stuff like publishing poetry in the East Coast rock magazine FUSION.  Then the first album came out, and it kinda stiffed.  (I loved it, however.)  And then, all of sudden, word was out (and so was Lou) that he had hooked up with Bowie and crew and was gonna show all the would-be decadents in London just how it was done.<br /><br />Great.  And when it came out, I snapped it up and played the hell out of it.  And yeah, when \\"Walk On the Wild Side\\" cracked the Top 40, well, I was pretty giddy.  They called it an \\"unlikely hit,\\" and I was like, \\"Oh, come ON. It's 1972 for cryin' out loud!\\"  It wasn't the first time Lou Reed had name checked Warhol denizens in song. \\"Candy Says\\" and \\"The Story of My Life\\" on the 3rd Velvets album had already established that trend), but those tunes were never candidates for the Top of the Pops--nor were they nearly as explicit.<br /><br />And of course, there's the \\"Andy\\" reference in \\"Andy's Chest,\\" a bit of surrealism that always struck me as a bit lazy lyrically.  It's a bit of a goof, and there are stories that it dates back to the Solanis shooting and was just a bit of nonsense Lou concocted to cheer Andy up during the latter's recuperation.<br /><br />Since the song dated back to the classic Velvets era, I cannot say it demonstrated a more recent shift toward \\"Come Together\\" type absurdism in his work.  But it does seem indicative of a emerging tendency toward glibness in his writing.  Coming sequentially, as it does, right after the equally playful (and silly) \\"Vicious,\\" the track suggested that while we might expect wit, word play and the occasional striking turn of phrase, what we wouldn't be getting was the sense of vision that was so evident in all the Velvet Underground records.<br /><br />And that was OK, really.  It was fine with me that Lou wanted to back off a little from his stark, near beat poet lyrics of yore.  Reed's obvious intelligence and flair were evident in tunes like \\"Wagon Wheel\\" and \\"Hangin' Round,\\" of course, but they did have a certain glib \\"rush job\\" quality to them that was both appealing AND a bit disturbing at the same time.<br /><br />On the other hand, there's a wry sweetness to \\"Satellite of Love\\" and the still fondly remembered  and oft covered \\"Perfect Day\\" that's undeniably touching.  \\"Perfect Day\\" gently mocks the cliches it trades in, and Lou's reading drips with an irony that the Susan Boyles of the world couldn't begin to conceive of.  On the other hand, I can't imagine that Lou didn't just get the biggest kick out of Boyle's take on his song.<br /><br />Cuz Lou was a complex guy, and the borders between his loves and hates--to say nothing ofhis ironies and sincerities--was never all that clear.  And that's just the way we fans liked it.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This is a really good app, I haven't been able to play my other game systems so this is a life saver, and I like a lot of first person shooter games.
B00005JL96|5.0|Love this movie; super cute but my 3 year old picked up a lot of words and behaviors I don't approve of between the sister and Lilo hollering at each other during the beginning, Lilo fighting with the girl at school, Lilo saying &#34;abomination&#34;, etc. It's not all bad, just could have been more appropriate for children.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love this app..so much fun for the whole family. if you love minions as i do you will love his app. adults and kids both will love his app. minions are so cute and I am so glad finally there is an app with them.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this series!  It's engaging and leaves the reader wanting more. I CO yup lent put it down.  must-read!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This book was a wonderful read.  Couldn't put it down.  Grisham sure knows how to tell a story and keep you wanting more.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|Great album...Paul can do anything and this album proves it.  How can someone writing songs for fifty years still come up with original melodic stuff without repeating himself?  Lightweights like Taylor swift and the like will never last
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This is a pretty good movie. My boyfriend loves it. I bought the dvd for him as a Christmas gift.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I definitely don't understand all the hype attached to this book. My bf suggested I read it, he heard from a friend that his gf loved it.  I'm all for hot, steamy scenes but I was definitely not impressed with this one.
B002KCNV70|5.0|Grandson wanted this item for Christmas.  It was just as I expected. Star Wars Lego is always a hit with boys of all ages. Hope he likes it too!
1451666179|5.0|This book is awesome. If you love the blog, you will love this book. If you don't love the blog, you will still love this book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I feel that my horse is super fun for all ages<br />Its a great way to realize how much it takes to own a horse
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I thought is was an excellent book, but I was expecting it to be like &#34;A Time to Kill,&#34; but it wasn't great, like that one.  I was intrigued and knew there would be twists and turns, and I wasn't disappointed!  There might have been more surprises by the defense.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I really am enjoying this game. The crowns high in price and you don't get them often, but patience is the key for this game. The colors are bright and brilliant.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A book I couldn't put down.  As soon as I was done, I read the next book.  The movies are decent but the book is truly better.
B003NB8KE6|5.0|Have you ever done a heavy leg workout, and then suffered the following 4 days because of it?  Every time you try sitting, you feel pain, and after just walking up 1 flight of stairs, your legs burn like hell?  If so, I highly recommend that you buy these pants.  I bought these last year after pulling my hamstring during a flag football game 3 days after doing a leg workout.  I was unable to play in the next 2 games.  Thankfully, that will never be a problem again.  I put these tights on immediately after I finish my post-workout shower, and will wear them for the remainder of the day and throughout the night.  They are very comfortable, and I am noticeably less sore the next several days.  I love these pants because I am not punished after getting in a good leg workout!
B0000027RL|5.0|Grunge at it's best.  I really didn't care for grunge but I have always liked Pearl Jam.  This is one of their best efforts and is a real crowd pleaser.  A really good addition to any serious music collection.  People will know you are a serious audiophile when they see this cd in your music collection.  Great price as well.  10 was Mookey Blaylock's jersey number when he was playing basketball, just a bit of trivia for ya.
B00BC254I8|5.0|I knew Mike Tyson didn't grow up in &#34;Malibu&#34; but I didn't realize hardly anything of what he went through. What was shocking was even with his fame and success he was still running around and getting into trouble. I also had no idea about his alcohol and drug abuse. The extent is astonishing and the fact he is alive is a mystery.<br /><br />I didn't feel like it was written in Mike's words. I am very educated and it was a bit much for me at times....and certainly not written in a way I would expect Mike to articulate his life. However if you put that aside the story is a great read. You definitely get your money's worth which I really appreciate. He could have written this into more than one book and made more money.<br /><br />Mike's life made me sad. He caused much of his troubles but given how he could grew up it is surprising. What made me sick was reading how he was constantly being sued for stupid things because he had money. I almost think people should go to jail for inflicting the time, pain and money on the wealthy.<br /><br />It was disappointing to read after I put this book down that at least until three months ago he was still abusing alcohol. I hope he makes it.<br /><br />Highly recommend this book. I &#34;pray&#34; Mike gets back on the right track. He seems to have a good heart.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|Really good compilation of Ray's duets.  I have been a fan of Ray Charles since I was a little kid and my mom played Ray Charles records while she cleaned the house.  I would dance and sing along and it was all great fun.  Ray Charles is one of the most versitle singer songwriters of the modern era.  This compilation with other artists showcases his versitility.  A great addition to any serious music collection.  My cat Sammy loves this cd.  When I put it on she curls up on the back of the couch and purrs and falls to sleep.  This is a 4 paws up from Sammy since if she doesn't like the music I play she runs and hides and I don't see her for days.<br /><br />A great buy at a great price.
0062059963|5.0|This is a great series and The Elite is no disappointment... unless the ending, because you wish you didn't finish it so fast. Just enough twists and interesting story plot to keep you guessing. Anyone interested in Fantasy/Romance without it being too &#34;far out there&#34; try this series.
B0028INIWE|5.0|Great compilation....all the best songs and then some without all the other boring and irrelevant stuff they put out.  A real gem for the serious collector's collection.
B00EI4V3X2|4.0|My first headset had a very bad noise/static comming from the right ear.  It was loud enough to hear it during the play on PS4.  My son and I decided to give it another try with a replacement headset and it works like a charm!  Fits good around my head, my son's head (12 yr ), with clear sounds, and did not have any issues pairing up right out of the box.  Lighter than I expected but overall good product.  Amazon has the best replacement policy in the world!!
B00307OTDE|5.0|A really good compilation of the best of Jimi Hendrix.  All of the great songs and a few that are less well known.  A good addition to any serious music collection.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|my kids love to play this game and it was very easy for them to learn how to play it.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|Some people have said that this a good cd and that Blake has sold out to the music business...that the songs are good and very easy on the ear but also very commercial...well duh.  What are successful artists trying to do?  Be Successful of course!  This is a good cd the songs are well crafted and are easy on the ear.  This is why Blake is a successful artist he knows his audience and what they want.  Even if you aren't a Blake Shelton fan, which until of late I wasn't, this is a good cd to break into his music.  The songs are well thought out and put together.  A good addition to any serious music collection at a great price.  You will not be disappointed .
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I downloaded this game for my kids and they love to play it. they found it very easy to play.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have to say, I'm really enjoying the reviews (both one-star as well as five-star). After reading all three books, this is my impression. In some aspects it is simply unbelievable . Ana is a virgin which seems to be a strong draw for Christian. And although she thinks of herself as being unattractive, all the  men around her are in love with her or desperate to get in her panties. Of course, the only man who attracts her enough to give up her virginity is Christian Grey, a billionaire, good looking beyond all expectations, and willing to give up his former lifestyle because he wants her so badly that it almost destroys him when she leaves him for five days.    All the women in Christian's life have been subs who he refers to as sexual partners. She's the only woman he has ever thought of as his lover. She saves him from all his past demons and helps him heal. Thank goodness! Because his family wasn't able to help him although they adopted him and gave him love and support for twenty four years. Not to mention the years of psychiatric support.    Then there is the constant internal dialog between Ana and her inner Goddess. Although, I have to admit that some of it was quite amusing at times. And how many times did Christian run his hand through his hair, or place a wayward strand of her hair behind her ear? What is the deal about her biting her lip? What the hell is sexy about that?  And all the eye rolling? Seriously?!    So why did I give this series five stars? Because it was a fun read. The flaws were almost as much fun as the story itself. I loved reading about Ana and Christian, Christian's family and Ana's friend Katherine. Did I mention that even though Katherine is beautiful, Christian doesn't find her attractive at all and thanks divine providence that Ana showed up for his interview instead.    It was a hoot reading about their first meeting and their first impressions of one another. It was also fun reading how they both kept one another so off balance.Would I refer this trilogy to anyone else? Yes, no...maybe. It depends on the person. If it is someone who is very knowledgeable about the BDSM lifestyle, I would probably suggest that they pass this by. I know how annoying it can be to read something that you feel is factually incorrect or depicts the world of BDSM to be something it is not.    Even I was annoyed when Ana wakes up with the the urgent need to urinate even though she has a foley catheter. Now, I could understand if she had the urge because of the pressure of the catheter in her urethra going up into her bladder, but the author actually has the nurse removing the catheter so she can go to the bathroom to relieve her distressingly full bladder. Now, since all her urine automatically drains into the foley bag, her bladder would be empty. I know, such a small thing, but, as a nurse, it bugged the hell out of me.    What didn't bother me was that Christian didn't mind having sex with her while she was on her cycle. In some reviews it was implied that men were put off by tampons, not to mention the idea of having sex with a woman during that time. In fact, the tampon scene is one of the major scenes the one-star reviewers find most repulsive. (Yes, he pulled her tampon out - really such a squick for so many?)    Hmm, what else? Ana's super never-ending orgasms? Christian's ability to keep an erection even after several bouts of sex? He keeps going just like the energizer bunny. It didn't bother me that Ana thought Christian's erect penis was huge. As a virgin she had probably never seen a man's erection close and personal before. Mostly I can look over it because even Christian assumes that's the case and assures her that she will expand as well. It also doesn't bother me that he is a good lover as some reviewers seemed to find comical. After all, he was coached by an older woman for six years. I would hope she taught him all about a woman's body and how to give her the most pleasure.    But then we have Ana and the apex of her thighs, not to mention \\"down there\\". Did I find the fact that she was humiliated at the thought of Christian watching her pee weird after everything else they had experienced? I haven't made up my mind yet. In one way, I think it's amusing that there is still one thing even she is freaked about. It could be thought of as an charming idiocracy.    But, all in all, this was a fun book to read and I would refer it to many of my friends.
006114665X|5.0|I take the books I read very seriously. These are my reviews, given with thought.This is what I think. I do not need more words.
B004J4WN0I|4.0|This book was good to the end! It's been a while since I've read something so engaging. Can't wait to read the others that I most certainly will be buying. My only hangup was that there were a few &#34;convenient&#34; situations, but nothing too overbearing.
0316056898|5.0|Within the 1st five minutes, I was laughing so hard that I almost ran off the road!!  I love that Tina Fey is the narrator.
B00FFERTUK|5.0|Not all songs are top 40, but it seems like this may be a mix of that and Nickelback's favorites.
B007SGM084|4.0|Long on the sex part but definitely worth reading. (Wish there were illustrations)  LOL!  I'm not quite versed in this type of sex. I too would like to read a follow up, to find out how hard it was for Christian to overcome his heartbreaking childhood and becoming a father.
B008JFUS5A|5.0|This movie is AWESOME! I saw it today and was very well pleased with the entire production. Definitely a must-see!!!
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|it was great and the fighters are awesome but you don't get enough reward money when you beat Midas to get a new bot
B00447L4JG|5.0|This is an absolute masterpiece; everyone should own this movie and watch it several times per year, You can use it as a gauge of how crappy most kids' movies really are. My children watch this a couple times per week, for several months now, and I have yet to tire of its marvelous visual details and incredible soundtrack.
B009PJ1Q82|2.0|just didn't like the story or the abuse they put each other through. Not sure why anyone would put themselves through the abuse even if for love.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|I downloaded this game because of the HIGH ratings. Unfortunately, for some reason, it doesn't work on my Kindle Fire HD (previous generation). I'm giving it a ONE STAR.
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|Like most sequels and this being no different it's run out of steam and good material. One was the best and two was pretty good. This one was ok.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I think it's great the only thing that I would is the timer for how long you have to complete levels it makes me nervous.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is great due to the fact that you don't have to purchase anything for the game to be fun. Lots missions and goal to complete, and competing against your friends via Facebook. This game keeps me entertained for hours.
B00FXMGI0G|5.0|Great movie! Waiting for Red 3... great acting, great script, great editing - all around great movie - will watch it again.
B00CBKXGPI|4.0|I have really enjoyed the works of art in this game.  It would be interesting if the game listed where some of these paintings are.  Fun hidden object game, very easy pace.  This is a nice change from some of the odd themes in some games.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|This is a redundant purchase. I am sure it is a good useful product but you can purchase Playon Premium for $60 and get Mymedia, Playmark, Playlater, and Playcast. You can stream anything you want on any device anywhere, so why bother with Chromecast? I am sure it's great, I just don't understand the obsession with a product that only delivers limited uses at best when you can spend $30 more and get everything.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|A very good short read.  The characters themselves go through very little if any growth throughout the story, but its completely irrelevant.  The story is about creating an interesting world with original concepts.  It completely succeeds in both aspects.  I found myself very eager to see what would happen next.  I would highly recommend this story to any fantasy or sci-fi fan.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I never expected to like reading an account of what effect WW II could have on the lives of the German people who passed through it.  The tender yet heavy work performed by none other than the angel of death as both a character as a well as the narrator of the tale make for an interesting combination.<br /><br />What I disliked most was the writers constant and repeated use of profanity by virtually every character, including the angel of death.  Note: Angel of death is my nomenclature, not the authors. He simply refers to him as death and that only at the end, though it becomes obvious at the beginning of the story that death is the narrator.<br /><br />I recommend this book to any serious reader of historic novels. My only caution is to those sensitive to profanity.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|It is a good easy read. It kept me wanting to read page after page. It has a good ending with closure and an interesting message that makes you ponder about your own life.
B00CQTKGY8|5.0|very practical, great info for people who want to have full advantade from the camera. good tips and advices and also home made mounts
B00DLVD2CS|5.0|I just got the SACD Orig. Master Recording of BILLY JOEL &#34;SONGS IN THE ATTIC&#34;.  I'm listening to it now - it's a 2 channel (Stereo) DSD and as someone who has had pretty much every version of this, this is BY FAR, the finest recording I've ever heard of this concert. It sounds like it was recorded yesterday - large soundstage, imaging, it's all here. I simply can't explain how clear this recording is - and I have not loved ever BJ SACD - but this one is worth its weight in gold.  Bravo.  The perfect version of this classic - too bad 5.1 went out of style as that would have been a nice addition - but this is fantastic.
030758836X|5.0|**NOTE: This review contains some SPOILERS**<br /><br />A friend recommended me this book, and I was markedly skeptical. First, I do not always trust this friend in the way of book recommendations (or movie recommendations or food recommendations, for that matter). Strike one. Also, I had heard a movie was in the works and one of the main characters was going to be played by Ben Affleck. Strike two. But before I could find a third strike, I decided to begin reading. And I hardly stopped until I was done.<br /><br />This is a mystery book MADE for mystery lovers. You quickly realize (**SPOILER ALERT**) that the narrator (both narrators, as a matter of fact) are unreliable, that protagonist and antagonist are useless definitions, and that Gillian Flynn loves playing games with your heart and mind. I loved this book, and I loved Flynn's writing style. Excellent read.
B000VX3832|5.0|It's timberland and a long standing high quality company and great shoe. It fits like all the other tims ive owned in the last 30 years and I expect the same wear as well! Great price great fit great shoe!
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|So far so good. I don't know why they ask you to give a review when you are only at the start of the game. Good graphics and storyline. Still playing for free. Not sure of the unlock at this point, but most likely will purchase it. If anything changes I will let you know.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|We'll written and a great story.<br />The author really put a lot of thought and interest into writing this book. I would highly recommend reading all three books.
B00DW1WR14|1.0|I really did not care for this album.  I have been a huge fan of Pearl Jam since 1992 when I first heard the rerecorded studio &#34;Evenflow&#34; on the video.  I really loved everything on Ten, and songs off of it that were released later like &#34;Chinese&#34; and &#34;Hold On&#34;.  Added to that I enjoyed songs that were on Vs. through the eponymous album.  However, I guess it is partly because Ed Vedder has more control of the band, according to Mike McCready in PJ 20 with the &#34;Stone then Ed now&#34; comment  that the music has changed, and the fact that the members now have different influences musically that I like their newer offerings less than their earlier ones.  Maybe my tastes have changed, or a combination of all of those separate factors.  Either way, I really enjoyed &#34;Sirens&#34;, but that was really all.  The other songs were good, but I did not enjoy them all of that much.  That being said....Pearl Jam is a great band, but I did not even upload any songs from Lightning Bolt except &#34;Sirens&#34;.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Awesome game! Great variety of action!!! I'm hooked, just can't put it down. Constantly exercising my brain I love the graphics
B00BDAP66E|1.0|Didn't do anything more than I can do from the Facebook application for my kindle. Sorry, but I ended up deleting the app within a day of downloading it. Can't recommend.
0307887960|5.0|So far I have been doing the diet and I have lost well over 30 lbs. I can wait to continue losing.
B000FC1192|5.0|I like the idea that you can never be too old for Coraline. I read it once when I was younger, and, bored of school work and looking for a creepy read, I remembered this book. I certainly was not disappointed; I loved it as much at the age of twenty-two as I did when I was twelve!
0439023521|5.0|Item as described, Fast delivery, Would do business again with seller. Thanks!
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Nice game with good graphics. The challenges are reasonably difficult. This is the first hunting game that I've downloaded on kindle fire and the other reviews are what sold me on it.
0439023491|5.0|Item as described, Fast delivery, Would do business again with seller. Thanks!
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|LOVE this game just wish you could play it without running out of energy and having to wait an hour or so far your energy core to replenish
B005P1YCNK|5.0|This  book was great. The concept seems so simple an  it is really. I really like how he provides worksheets and tasks to implement to get you started. I wanted to start changing things in my business and home and everything but like he says focus on little steps in one area and  be  patient. Excited to see what my next year will be like.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I would really like it if you let people create nether portals in creative.<br />And why make it so complicated to build them. And please add ender portals and add fish and enchanting tables.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|ok..ok.. I have to type so many many words to post this so here goes.  ITS STRYPER AND IT A GREAT ALBUM AND ITS PRODUCE VERY WELL..

B007HJ9NBE|5.0|the movie was awesome the stream was good no brakes and movies where easy to find thanks a lot .
B008G12ERC|5.0|great music.I discovered this music from a movie.i had to wait for credits on a song at the end of the movie but since my purchase of this music now I hear the music on the radio.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Loved every minute of reading this fantastic masterpiece<br />This was my second time reading this book!<br />Would strongly recommend this book to any sci fi fan
B004EK926K|3.0|I think this is an excellent Christmas movie for adults and older children who do not get scared easily. I personally enjoyed it very much, especially the beautiful music, fantastic visual effects, and the fun ending. One of the Christmas movies which give a wonderful sense of a joyful, sincere conversion of heart.<br /><br />But the huge downside of this movie is that it is not suitable for young children, and even many older children and adults may find certain scenes highly unpleasant. It has scenes which are very scary, dark, and gruesome. In one scene, probably the creepiest scene I have ever seen in a family movie, you watch a man dramatically age and turn into a skeleton over the course of about a minute while he is shouting and laughing maniacally.<br /><br />I have no idea how on earth the creators thought these terrifying scenes would be loved by children. Who OK'd this?<br /><br />One of the aspects I love about the movie is how close it stays to the book, but it exaggerates the scary parts. The book itself has some dark and scary parts, but the movie actually exaggerates and prolongs these, as well as adding some of its own. It would have been much better for it to tone these parts down considerably, make them more comical and less dark, and instead emphasize the happy parts, especially the ending.<br /><br />There are a couple lines from the book which the movie changes to tone down religious elements (though the movie is filled with religious music and some religious imagery), and one line which is changed into an explicit critique of &#34;men of the cloth&#34;. This is just another way the creators shot themselves in the foot here, because this line is sure to offend many religious people while attracting few others. Religious sentiment aside, I think it is a silly diversion which awkwardly distracts from the otherwise memorable scene.<br /><br />This is a movie I will continue to personally enjoy myself, but I will never show it to children under about age 10.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I luv this game because u can change ur suits and boards this game is LITT OR NAA ITS LITT U DONT HAVE TO SAY NUTHIN
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I loved the ending to it because of Bella and Edward Cullen in the field and I am sad because this is the last book in the series and I want to hear about Bella and Edward with their daughter more now. I ❤️ Edward Cullen. Team Edward is awesome
B00C5R7B0I|1.0|I purchased this book without reading the reviews -- big mistake!  I have read most, if not all, of the Scarpetta novels, and this one will be my last.<br /><br />What a conglomeration of mush.  I kept hoping that the &#34;old&#34; Scarpetta would surface to save this book, but it was not to happen.<br /><br />This is one of the worst novels I read during 2013.<br /><br />Save your money for something else.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game I can never stop playing<br />Perfect game to waste your time with<br />I recommend this game
B000QCS8TW|5.0|The book is well written.  The characters are well developed. It not a book for those that like happily ever after.  If you like grit and dirt in your characters you'll love this book. I hate I waited so many years to read it.
B00G4NUQYM|5.0|I needed a more challenging game. I wanted to find a word game and this on  is perfect. I've been playing it with my husband. So far I don't see any problems with game. I was kind of surprised at some of the answers. This game is perfect for anyone who likes crosswords.
B00G6YH6G0|5.0|What a literary accomplishment. This novel is so creative, so unique, so hard-to-put down that I didn't want to finish it. The plotting is intricate and the writing superb. It is hard to imagine the author is as young as she is. I haven't read anything this engrossing in a very long time. I found myself waking at 4am and reading for an hour or two before going back to sleep! Don't be put off by the length. Unlike, Donna Tartt's Goldfinch, this book never drags at all. The narrative drive is impressive. Somehow Catton manages to create 13 or more unique voices and characters and a spell-binding plot. If you enjoy solving mysteries you will enjoy this intellectual puzzle. I can't wait to read her first book now... The Rehearsal.<br /><br />The Booker committee did not let us down this year. The Luminaries is a winner! I bought it on Kindle but also in Hardcover. The book is worth owning and the two will sync up so you can go back and forth. Early on, I liked the hardcopy to track all the characters, but ultimately it is not needed. Still, the plot is intricate and if you plan on taking long breaks it is best to get the hardcopy and browse earlier chapters. Enjoy this gem!
B001PPGAIA|5.0|what can i say? hugh jackman is just too sexy
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Takes me back to Grisham's A Time to Kill where I can envision the same characters who played in the movie.  The character development in Sycamore Row was true to form.  The plot thickened and even though it was not a complex plot and the reader could guess the ending, it was a page turner.  It would be a great movie and their are many unanswered questioned that might  lead Grisham to write a sequel.  My husband read it while I read it;  it made for good discussions without giving away what happens next.
B004SIP8JI|5.0|the most incredibly cute/fun movie i've seen in a long long time.
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|she has a wonderful voice!  this is definitely a must have for fans of hers and christmas music!  i will enjoy it for years to come!
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Very disappointing not to get any coins after expending them all. I doubt I'll get any of my friends to play being older than most all players, so unless I want to she'll out real money, I won't be able to continue playing. I love the minions but without coins, I won't get to enjoy their antics.
B00FN3HRG4|5.0|i actually bought two of these!  one for myself and one to give to my sister for her christmas present from me this year.  i love it!
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|A surprisingly cute move!  My girls are obsessed (that's an understatement) with MLP, so this was a great way to branch off from the norm without traveling too far from the path.  It's a great movie for young girls!  The &#34;magic of friendship&#34; theme was obvious throughout, and, despite some cheeky comments and bad attitude from the movie's villain, is a very clean and family-friendly film.  We only do movies on Friday nights, so my kids don't really have much exposure to regular cartoons and such.  We've been careful to select shows and themes that promote positive attitudes and choices, and this movie doesn't disappoint.  Of course, I get a bit tired of hearing of the high-pitched voices of some of the characters, but that's probably just a &#34;Mom&#34; thing.  I suppose it's payback for all the Care Bears and Duck Tales I watched when I was a kid -- now I know what my mother meant when she said she could only take so much cartoon talk.  :)  Either way, if you have daughters that love MLP or if you're just looking for a clean, cute movie with a good lesson, this is a good choice!
B00EKXDVOK|5.0|i flipped when i saw this!  two cd's from barbra streisand in the same year.  this is definitely a must for any fan of hers.  i was able to combine my love of her music and christmas music with this cd!
B000002BHE|5.0|I bought this, AGAIN, as I can't find mine, enjoying it the second time around. She, like Streisand, can make any note sound beautiful.
B006TKP2B2|2.0|Not a very griping story.  Not sure what the author's goal was.  I thought the premise and nature of the dystopian world was not well explored soot seemed fake the whole time.  It was sort of a political book but I didn't really empathize with anyone.
630471193X|5.0|This movie, as with the previous ones, has been bought for a friend. I KNOW the movie is wonderful, taken license with a fantasy that makes it interesting, also a tender love story.
B00F56AZK4|4.0|I enjoy puzzles that are not too complicated, and the free puzzles are just my speed.  Also, you don't have to worry about dropping the pieces on the floor!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book has so many great life lessons!  My 3rd grade daughter read it and loved it.  It should be mandatory reading for all 4th or 5th graders (before middle school) and maybe middle school would not be such a horrible time in adolescence for everyone.  This book opens up great topics for discussion with children about what really matters in life and how the right choices usually require the most work or hardship but yield the greatest rewards.<br />I never write reviews, but I had to for this book.  READ, READ, READ!!  And recommend to everyone you know who has children.  I know I'll be making sure the teachers at our school know about &#34;Wonder&#34;.
B00D6SBOWG|4.0|I enjoyed the game.  It is solitaire with a story and a twist.  I was disappointed when the game got to the point of asking for real money to keep playing.
B00D3NSDVO|5.0|Just quite original story. A novel of suspense and intricacy outperforming most similar novels. One of the best reads since the original Robert Ludlum. A great read.
B00BAXFCPO|4.0|I found this book full of valuable information. The more we know about the foods we eat, the more control we have over our health. Be aware that the major food corporations put profit before people.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|enjoy working at keeping the food supplied and designing the restaurant, actually also enjoy the interaction with my fellow neighbors
B005K17RU0|5.0|I've tried several weather apps an this one is the best I've used. Several components of the other apps in this one. Maps are accurate an show great detail.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I was very impressed with this book: far better than the movie. I would recommend this to any reader; excellent read!
B000BTC5LW|5.0|This one of their best alblums, if you like classic rock, this needs to be in your collection also !!  David Gilmore is a great Artist in the greatest way!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is a game were it has a lot of updates you can do like anything build battle advenchers and many more its basiclly like real life but more to it just get it its awsome
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's more then a game to me because I play it every hour I think if u get it make sure u wanna have a good time.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|4 year old grandson loves this game.  I actually like it myself.  We enjoy playing it together.  I would recommend to a friend.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|After years pondering over diet plans, macronutrient ratios, supplements and a never-ending string of workout routines, I had gotten basically nowhere! Then I read this book and I finally had THE RIGHT information, set in stone, no pseudoscience and I'm actually making real progress! This is a great book well worth the money and is recommend getting his cookbook too because it's awesome!
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|I have read this series from the beginning. Every read is great. I love the development of all the characters in various stories. I always look forward to the next. Great job and keep up the good work. Story was awesome with the tying in of two famous authors, Wilde and Doyle. What a story weaved into the mix.
B00330UFQS|5.0|The group, Lady Antebellum, has been one of Pop's most successful groups in the past couple of  years.  Multiple Grammy Awards, wonderful songs with catchy lyrics,  and lyrics that actually mean something, have made them rise faster then a rocket.<br /><br />This particular album - Need You Now, had all the makings of a hit.  Was it?  Sure as, well winning how many Grammy awards does say something, doesn't it?<br /><br />My favorite song is the title song: Need You Now, a song that most of us have sung late at night when we're alone, wondering why we didn't ask them over, didn't ask them to stay.<br /><br />It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone, and I need you now.<br /><br />I need to listen to Lady Antebellum now.......
B0019FWIEQ|5.0|Two great actors doing what they do best.  Or in the case of Cusack, second best.  He's actually a GREAT cook.  Good story, nicely done.  This will give an evenings entertainment.
B00138CYD4|5.0|What more can I say about Santana that you, the reader, don't already know?<br /><br />I've been listening to Santana since the early 1970's when he, and his first group, released &#34;Evil Ways&#34;.  Their Spanish Rock and Roll/Blues has been the mainstay of their group since the beginnings and the reason why, and how, they've been so popular over time.  Plus you have Carlos Santana - one of the greatest.<br /><br />If you don't have much of his later works, get this album - it has everything - from earlier hits to his more current one.<br /><br />Santana flies.
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|I chose this rating because I enjoy irony overly much.  Great fast movie, fun to watch, bet the book was SLAMMING good times.  This may be a spoiler but...according to the movie the entire thing would have been over the very second someone noticed that folks in hospitals and nursing homes, or those with very bad colds, weren't being attacked.  Anyways it is action packed and if you don't expect your brain to get a look at the plot holes and broken devices you'll really really like it!
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|One of the best of the match three games I've ever come across.  Very addictive, very challenging, and quite fun.  If you haven't played a match 3 game in awhile, definitely get this one, or at least sample this one.  It is one of the BEST I've ever played.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app works just like my iPhone app...great!! It's great for my notes and recipes. Just put them into my Evernote and I can get it on the go whenever I want.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|The game is awesome just the lives you get you only have like 5 lives then you have to wait along time:)
B00BU8QOII|5.0|Great Movie it makes you think about life and how it can change in a second!!...keeps you on the edge
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Secret society is by far the most challenging HO game I have ever played. The different scenes that get added as you play add to that fact tremendously. If you like HOS this is most definitely the game for you!
B001NVIZ3E|5.0|This movie was very well done. The blue Ray is excellent. I really loved the extras and especially the one about Technicolor.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|I don't love it, but my daughter loves it,  the music just keeps going.  fun to a little girl though
B00F031XPS|5.0|Great Blue Ray. I saw the American Masters special and decided I wanted to add this to my collection.<br />I enjoyed the extras a lot.
B00CH3DBNQ|4.0|This book has a lot of very interesting facts about history yet it is told tenderly through the heart of a sensitive and thoughtful girl. Very inspirational.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Thoughtfully written.  I must admit though, I had the end of the book worked out at about a third of the way in.  At the time I thought \\"no way can Jake lose\\".  A happy ending for all.  Unfortunately, life doesn't always work that way.  Still, a good story, as always from Grisham.<br /><br />E. M. Giffin.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved how it told the stories of several families and how you need to watch and say what you do in your life because if you do something bad it may come back around to you.
0316044938|1.0|this book was a huge disappointment.  i did not enjoy reading it at all.  At first i kept going, reading through all the detailed descriptions of people and places and events i had no interest in, in hopes that there would be some exciting ending that made it all worth while.  There wasn't.  It felt like this book was a compilation of college essays where the assignment was to add a lot of description to a mundane scene or childhood memory.  I read this book because it had 4 stars by 3k plus reviewers, but after reading it, I am completely baffled by how other people liked this book!
1451673442|5.0|Very insightful...really helping me grow... and change my mind set to positive energy. Very Thankful for the knowledge...Thank You for the Teaching...
B000BVMAJ2|3.0|I was disappointed that the animal toys were the same size as those in the Delux Duplo zoo.  I was hoping they'd be smaller than the &#34;adult&#34; animal sizes.  If you already have the Duplo zoo, this only has a few different pieces.  It looks like there is a lion cub instead of a tiger, and there is a &#34;grass&#34; piece as well as a female zoo keeper.  My 2 year old was happy with the items, but it didn't add enough to the zoo set to make it worth purchasing.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Wonderful to see Pendergast back solving mysteries and away from family problems.  Well worth the read.  Couldn't  put it down!  Hope another comes soon.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It's Firefly - need I say more? I watched it when it first came out and as any Brown Coat will tell you, it was short lived,<br />but remains one of the best shows anyone who enjoys sci-fi can watch. Much like Star Trek or Star Wars, it leaves you<br />wanting the freedom of space and all it has to offer, shiny or not.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Haven't played too much yet,  but so far so good. I am enjoying the game very much.  It is easy to play, the controls are good, and the graphics are ok.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad I can get this game on my kindle now. I've been waiting forever for them to put it on kindle. I played it religiously on my phone until now! So happy!
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Well written, action packed and one I would recommend reading.  The author keeps you on your toes with this one.
B009GXHOW4|4.0|CRAZY I broke minecraft with this app. I just changed to creative and then I saw a zombie!!!??!!?? It was totally creepy. Download this app and brake minecraft but it's still awesome
B00001ZULV|4.0|Great album but leave the Carpet Crawlers as it was originally!!!!!! That is the one song I bought the album for but most songs are excellent. Good album.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Loved the alcohol addicted performance of Denzel. Also the cover up makes you think that this really happens.  Scary!  The next time I fly I will be thinking of the condition of the pilots.
B007SGM084|5.0|Oh my God, it's great! Can't wait to see the movie that I'm sure will be coming. If you're going to get one, get them all.
B00BAXFECK|4.0|Tartt may have been faulted for loose plotting in the past, but that isn't so in this novel. The plot moves along, so much so that the book is hard to put down at times. Wonderful writing, inventive descriptions, excellent background research, fully-realized characters. Only the ending disappoints, being a bit pontifical without full resolution.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Lonely persons kryptonite it's the best yet frustrating  challenge waste a lot of time playing but reassures I have something much larger yo achieve n life lol
B001JI8IJW|5.0|This is a well written, well directed and well acted spy thriller. I am hooked on this film. Robert Redford's character is a true heroic man who does something atypical for a veteran CIA case manager in the field. Watch it to find out. I don't want to spoil this film.<br />If you like Lawrence of Arabia; Heat; The Kingdom; The Bourne Trilogy....then you will like this. It is really a feel good movie. That is the irony.
B00CGNYDIE|5.0|Great logic game.  I liked that I could go at my own pace and figure out what colors the blocks should.  It seemed like mindsweeper, just with colors instead of bombs.
B00BMKDTNC|3.0|Really disorganized through the various themes.  It seemed like half of the book was spent doing the same fight scenes over and over.
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|Tiny Thief is so much fun to play.  It is so cute and the story line is fun.  Some levels were so ingenious that I played them more than once just to see how it all played out.  It really makes you think when you have to find all the hidden objects.  I think this would be great to play with kids cause it is like having an interactive story book.  I hope Rovio Stars will make more games like Tiny Thief.
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|Listened to it on youtube and thought, I might buy this album.<br /><br />Minimalistic. CD cover is a faded white with streaks of gray with an L on the bottom (about one inch) and a Greek-like black/white logo on the top (about a half-inch diameter). Contains a booklet with lyrics and a few pictures. Black background and ~6px white font.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|When i bought this game  i had no idea what it was going to be like, i played the campaign and thought,&quot;wow this isn't bad&quot; the graphics are pretty superb for a handheld device game and the game play is good as well. I then played the online version and was blown away. You can choose what guns u buy, it doesn't take forever to save up money, there's different types of multiplayer you can play. I  play it all the time. Most definitely worth the money. There is one small problem though, there are no vehicles, and sadly there aren't more maps there's like 6 or 7 maps which is a good number, i just wish there was more. But amazing game.
0804161380|4.0|This is an amazing edition to and Zelda fan's collection. I don't understand why they didn't either a)leave a spot for the link between worlds guide or b)include it in the bundle. Especially since it was released at the same time as the game
B00992CF6W|5.0|I really like it. I enjoy doing multiplayer with my brother and sister but.. It only lets me connect to my brothers world. I can't ever get to my sisters and they can't get to my world! :( Otherwise I say it was SO WORTH 7$ FUN!! beware of Creeperrs btw. On survival mode if you make a base and cover it up then at night time a and you are away from your base sometimes as spiders,zombies, etc, get in it and end up killing me.. No blood or violence and Apollo fun! PLAYED IT FOR HOURS
B009R6GN22|5.0|If norman mailer is the modern archetype of the modern day sex goddess myth, than spoto is the opposite, he really tries to cut through all the story telling,and get to a fairly objective perspective of an actual person.its probably impossible to get a more accurate portrait of M.m. than this. I think he may have gotten emotionally involved with his subject,he really seems to care for Monroe.you can add to it though.i rather like sara churchwells book,but as a complete over view,this would be hard to better.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have this game on my iPad and kindle fire... I recommend this to horse lovers and anyone looking for an animal game. I highly recommend this game.
B004132I20|5.0|There have been so many Sherlock Homes that is pointless to count. Sadly, they all really bore me, so I was reluctant to watch it. I was more than surprised to find that its both clever, witty, funny, and gives plenty of twists for the viewer throughout the entire episodes. The episodes themselves are about an hour long which is why there are so few episodes a season. Makes it no less epic. I recommend this show to anyone!
B00B9366VO|3.0|Worth watching but it was way too long.  It was entertaining and informative, but seemed to go day by day and month by month instead of a 1/2 an hour show giving the highlights of an amazing studio.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Cool beans good time killer. The game play is good the graphics are good defiantly a suggested game. Now I'm just typing words to finish this review.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game os awesome but also can be really hard lol but ots really fun an! deserves five stars so five it is
B00E9A656K|3.0|For being a free app it's kool. It is challenging at first aging money n saving well that's not very big pay out<br />...
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I loved this book series and it touched my heart and I cried for Tobias and tris and uriah my eyes were red in the end of this book.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|five stars<br />loved it really makes me cry and smile<br />loved the characters<br />it just inspires me it doesn't mater what u look like be yourself
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Spoilers ahead,<br /><br />Many people are giving this book bad reviews for the ending. If you have read the book or have seen other reviews you would have learned of Tris' s death. In my opinion it was well written and followed the story line. Sad, yes, but bad writing? No. What people Don't understand is this was a DIS-utopian society. The tragic ending was implied. Her death did come as a shock to me as I had expected Tobias to be the victim, but the twist added something special. It was well written as said above and I was shaking my head at the end wondering why I had not expected it. Her death made this book different from the terribly written series, the hunger games (Not the first, but definitely the last two). In this book you are not screaming for satisfaction. In the hunger games it  was as if katniss was just dealing with the life she was left with. In this book you feel Tobias' s pain, but you also see him moving on.<br />I gave this book three stars because the writing ( up to the climax) was average. Tobias was a weak character and nothing like four In the first books. At times I couldn't see the difference between his pov and the pov of Tris. Also I felt as though the setting of the outside world was made by a child. Little detail was given as to why the genetics of people were changed. Also the US government is mentioned, but never explained. Crime is everywhere to the point there is no safe place to live, yet there is a government. This altered the story from a dis-utopia to a post apocalyptic world.<br />In conclusion while I thought the ending left me settled and was a good wrap up to this story the explanation of the world along with the weak writing made this an overall average read.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I LOVE Lindsey S's energy which is completely reflected in her music.  This was a wonderful album for times when I want active music.  I can't wait for her next album!
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|I would love it, if it didn't freeze every other time.  Little pricey if you want to advance faster than a snail.
B00139XTG4|5.0|I was fascinated by the book on first reading and like another reviewer would like to read it again to pick up on some concepts, but not sure that I will anytime soon.  I came to this book by a comment made in the recently published Amazon/Bezos biography “The Everything Store”.<br /><br />As a Director of Clinical Data Management and Programing at a medical school, I am very sensitive to improper analysis, faulty assumptions and the host of issues like narrative fallacies.  Some years ago and without knowledge of this book’s contents I came up with my own versions of two of the important points in the book – 100 coin flips coming up mostly heads and wrongly assuming variances in continuous variables are Gaussian distributions.<br /><br />I was somewhat turned off by Taleb’s continuous knocking of Nobel awardees, although a point once made would have been fine.<br />This work reinforces other critical works including “Wrong” and “Inviting Disaster: Lessons From the Edge of Technology”.  At this point I’ve come to the conclusions – not necessarily original thoughts that:<br />•  Planning is useful for evaluating options, plans “don’t survive the first contact with the enemy”<br />•  Unexpected things will always happen; one can’t predict what’s going to happen, only something unexpected will happen.<br />•  Experts are frequently wrong – some have no intent to deceive and others are following their own agenda
B000I8ERVC|2.0|The movie is the embodiment of the existentialism philosophy.  [Spoiler Alert]  The road trip [life] has no larger meaning except as an avenue to explore one hedonistic experience after another.  There is no higher purpose and the two protagonists eventually end up dead on the side of the road.  The interesting part of the film is that it tried to portray the counterculture movement as the heirs to the traditional American life.  Wyatt and Billy are modern cowboys.  The hippie communes are the heirs of the traditional farmers and ranchers.  The sentiment is given voice by George Hanson [Jack Nicholson]:  \\"You know, this used to be a helluva good country.  I can't understand what's gone wrong with it.\\"    Easy Rider also attempts to redefine the traditional American definition of \\"freedom.\\"  In the same monolog previously mentioned, George Hanson explains that Wyatt and Billy make people nervous because they represent true freedom.  He then defines freedom as the ability to do what you want, when you want, without any societal restraints.  The Founding Fathers of the United States defined freedom [liberty] as the ability to do what was right.  They defined the ability to do whatever you wanted without restraint as licentiousness and warned that it would eventually lead to the loss of freedom and liberty.  Easy Rider and the existentialist culture succeeded in altering the concept of American liberty and freedom away from what the Founders envisioned.    Overall, the movie is a good representation of the existentialist life.  Otherwise, it is a boring and meandering journey with only a few highlights.  I am glad I watched it but it is not going to be a personal favorite.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|in got this app because everyone said its like no other. but every app is like that. I like the jewled games much better than this suckish app. sorry if ur a little kid and if u think its a bad word I'm sorry. but really this app is lame its just with candy. every app is like this again the jewled games are much much better. now say yes so I can get to the top of the reviews please. thank you for taking the time to read my review.
B00B8M4IMK|1.0|This product never worked, I held it for a while in hope that it was just my car that it did not like . . . Nope . .  equal opportunity hater this thing.  Cute  . . .  but epic fail.
B00881VLCE|5.0|The puzzles are all you wanted.  You can choose different sizes of the same one according to how difficult you want it to be.  Lots of different ones to choose from as well. Very highly recommended if you enjoy a challenge. You don't have to pay to get a larger size as with other puzzle apps.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Good ol' Stephen King....my kind of writing.  I'm happy I read the Shining and saw the movie because some of those characters have returned in Dr. Sleep.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|The native stereotypes are annoying but the game is entertaining. I find myself bristling at the use of &#34; manifest destiny,&#34; though I believe it is meant as a joke.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Destroying the human race is pretty addictive, never thought I would shout curses at Greenland but there is a first time for everything. Challenging and entertaining, a little humor and a lot of strategy.
B002QKZLZ6|1.0|There was nothing wrong with the shipment but it just doesn't fit the headset well. Too tight and cheaply thought through in design.
B000BD0P38|1.0|DVD  would not play and we returned it.  We would like to get one we could play if we could find it.  Had to pay shipping both ways.
0316055433|5.0|Beautiful, great characters, well written, thrilling, done well. A book you simply wont put down. Donna Tartt has made a must read!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game because it makes you think.  It's good for older adults because it keeps the brain working.
B004Y5AV4M|5.0|First read this book as a teen and have enjoyed all of Ms. Heyer's books ever since.  Likable characters, and even knowing that all will turn out right it is still an enjoyable read and way to pass an afternoon.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|This book was not the style of novel I usually read.  It was well written and engaging, but just not for me.
0061564893|5.0|Favorite book ever!!<br />I love how he talks about map readings in a way that only a mariner or a captain could..expressed in such an understandable way.. history becomes so alive!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is really fun...WARNING: Very Addicting Candy Crush Saga is a great positive game that is fun for everyone.
B00DUIBZSK|5.0|I love this album. Its fun, yet you can listen to it while relaxing, and if you want to dance to it, go ahead!<br /><br />I had to buy the album that included the 4 extra tracks because they were all amazing as well. I'm just glad amazon finally offered them!
B008B8AOQI|5.0|Great band! Very much in tune with the genre. I've shared it with a few of the people in the office and everyone really likes it.
B00B89WXYS|5.0|An amazing album. It is beautiful.  One republic is a new artist for me, and from what I've found, this album is very different from other albums that they have produced, but I can say that this one is a hit in my book. I could listen to it all day and not get bored or burnt out with it.
B00EXVZW6E|3.0|Simple, but not a bad little game. Once you get the first couple of levels done, the rest just become a little too simple. Enjoyable, for a time.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|Jennifer Lawrence shows us that she can push herself into many different roles, and conquer them all flawlessly.  She did a great job performing in this movie, and the movie itself is great as well.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|Doesn't work on my Kindle Fire, 1st Generation. May need to upgrade to play. Locks up my Fire every time.
B00908DDZM|5.0|People may look at Ryan and Macklemore and think of them as just another rapper, money hogging artist group.<br /><br />But they rap and sing about more than the typical.  They stand up for what they believe in, and they have experience to back everything up.<br /><br />I am a definite supporter of their music, for what they say and the messages that they are trying to send.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|As usual, John Grisham puts out stories with flowing eloquence, intrigue, and his amazing knowledge of the law.  This book is worth the long length, I enjoyed every page of it.  One thing though:  no loose ends tied up re: side-stories;  for one, I'd still like to know if Carla and Jake ever did buy that heritage home...
B00DHHWY9I|5.0|Amazing movie. What can I say? It shows that there is evil in everyone.  Gatsby and Daisy were both shallow individuals. Gatsby was in love with the idea of Daisy, but found the real her hard to swallow, and tried to get her to give it all up and repent.  Daisy loved Gatsby, but couldn't give up the security and money that she had been given, even if she wasn't exactly.
B00F2362IE|5.0|This app is so Asome and you need to get this  app. BOOYOCASHA! See you later turtlenater!  Turtle up guys!
B004G6009U|5.0|Just beautiful. What can I say? An amazing take on an old story. Disney did a wonderful job. I only wish they had brought out a full length second movie for it.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I have read all his books.  This one was very well written and engaging,<br />Very good story and ending .
0316236535|5.0|I work at a child development center, and my kids love this book. They love to yell &#34;GO AWAY&#34; at the top of their lungs.
B00DKY4LBW|5.0|I love almost every song on the album. Fresh new sound while still being Arctic Monkeys. Each song has its own quality to love and the lyrics are fantastically written -- especially in Arabella.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I'm not usually into this type of novel but I thought I would give it a try.  The writing is good, and characters well done.  The story is very intriguing.  I am interested to see what happens in the next installment.
B000002JPA|5.0|One of my favorite albums, this CD is awesome. It came in great condition, despite being pre-owned. I listen to it all the time and the quality is amazing. I'm very pleased with this product.
B009IN3AOS|4.0|Good Stuff...nothing on it is really barn burning good, but there is an overall nice vibe to the album and the sound.
630542845X|4.0|A good supernatural movie.  My wife really loved it, and I enjoyed it as well despite it being somewhat slow paced.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I can't stop playing this game! If you've never tried Candy Crush, you simply have to right away. If you've played before on Facebook, this app runs the game very smoothly, making it easy to play on the go. Use those lives as you receive them on your Kindle Fire!
B00C8RFPQ2|4.0|Not great, but if you liked the first movie you should like this one.  Much better than the previews made it look.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|Wonderful story, well written a great read! Long book but worth every page! Unique and intriguing storyline. Enjoyable and fun
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Oh my goodness, I loved this book so much! It has been on my 'to-read' list forever and I am so glad I finally got around to reading it. I needed something light-hearted after reading two major emotional books back-to-back and this really did the trick. I loved how it was from Drew's POV. This book had me giggling and smiling and I loved 'getting inside his head'. The characters were great and I LOVED his little niece and the way he adored her!<br /><br />Definitely recommend this one!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I watched this show a couple of time in the first season and was not impressed. I do not receive the AMC channel so i lost touch of the series. Last year I came across the series on Amazon Prime and watched a couple of the shows. I am hooked. The shows offer good drama and suspense. I have come to like a number of the characters which is probably a mistake since the show's writers have no problem eliminating characters from the show. The show is not for the squeamish .
B003V4AK8E|1.0|This should be called a wired controller not wireless because that is what it is. Got this earlier today and it only functions when the usb cable is plugged in. As soon as you unplug the controller goes off(even though it shows ). Be sure you know what you are signing up for before buying this...doesnt hold charge!!
1400163439|3.0|The Man Who Loved Books Too Much is an interesting little audiobook (only 5 CDs) that takes the reader into the world of bibliophiles, con men, and bibliomaniacs. Allison Hoover Bartlett, a journalist, has given us a very approachable read on John Gilkey, a con man who stole hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of rare and valuable books over the years. The author captures his sense of entitlement and his total lack of guilt over theft.<br /><br />This book was narrated by Judith Brackley, who has an even, melodious voice. She brought the elements of incredulity, wonder, disgust, and sadness to this tale.
B007QV0FEW|5.0|I have been living in a country dying from lack of identity.  The media, journalism, and critics scoffing at the Christian faith has know idea that it is losing its inheritance of freedom.  My faith is under attack by an ever present political correctness that denies the freedoms, and shouts down those who would challenge the skepticism inherent in that type of suppression.  Freedom needs definition and identity.  I am only truly free when I am free of the oppression of self loathing.  I am set free by the truth of orthodoxy.  Orthodoxy is higher, greater, freer, and fairer than this present age.  It contains eternal values not the whims of a wayward society.  If you wanted to be lifted up a solid orthodoxy is the only way to set yourself free.  This book will encourage those who seek freedom from doubt.  Chesterton had more journalistic ability in his slightest word than the humdrum message one finds in today's literature.
B003E6K1VK|5.0|Love this little headphone amp. It makes my MP3 player's battery last longer and the sound is fantasctic. Great seller too!
B00DXLO0D6|5.0|Excellent value for the price! I can't believe I got the whole 5 years the series was on for the price of what I have paid for one season of Alice. Picture quality is excellent. Packaging could be better. DVDs are stacked one-on-one in the case.  Afraid they may get scratched that way eventually, but don't let that stop you from buying this fun series for lighthearted entertainment worth its weight in gold!
B003B02O0A|5.0|Read it for the second time before the latest Grisham novel.  And it is still spellbinding and a great read.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I love when authors tell the truth in ways that make you hurt and hope all at the same time!  This does just that.
B0056BMK6K|4.0|A good read if you are a person trying to sell your books and having a hard time doing so.  Mr. Locke holds nothing back when he explains what helped him sell 1 million books in 5 months.  Very informative.
B002U5HKZ6|4.0|THERE ARE FEW BOOKS THAT I HAVE READ THAT HAVE CAUSED ME TO REALLY REFLECT AND THINK ABOUT WHAT I JUST READ--THIS HAPPENS CONSTANTLY. I HAVE NEVER BEEN TO INDIA AND BOMBAY(NOW MUMBAI) BUT I THINK THE BOOK ACCURATELY CAPTURES THE PEACEFUL, LOVING AND SPIRITUAL NATURE OF ITS PEOPLE--- ON TOP OF THAT IT IS A VERY GOOD STORY AS WELL
1780540655|5.0|Great calendar of Michael Jackson.  The photos featured were of top quality and were simply amazing in their realism.  This is my second year in getting a Michael Jackson calendar and I can truly say I have not been disappointed.  I will be ordering a 2014 calendar as well in the future.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|this is the best game I got next to subway surfers or draw something anyway this is an awesome game if you get to a certain level you unlock the song it is an amazing game
B008XG1X18|5.0|If you love Pinterest this App it is a necessity for Kindle Fire. It works great. The only down side is there Pinterest is very addicting :)
B00EKHE1JA|5.0|Because the figure is well detailed and pretty fun to play with,  It is well made and pretty robust.  The blades on the forearms are pretty sharp.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Fantastic! I love seeing a strong female lead in movies who isn't sexualized. The story is great, the acters/actresses are great and I loved the book!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Started this game yesterday evening and I am hooked, can't seem to stop playing, saw my friends playing all day and now realize why the
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Didn't think I would like it, but it's very addictive and it's good for the old brain.  I need more lives, so send as many as you can.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|I don't like this game because it needs an update and I don't like how I can't even play my original game and its getting on my nerves.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game because unlike other games this one is tough but fun and addicting. I prefer this game to anyone that's looking forward to puzzle things.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game so is so fun I love the little minion costumes they are so festive and cute but I would like more of them that cost bananas.
B001V7SME2|4.0|A great movie, very dark and compelling. You barely notice the subtitles, it's so well-acted.  It's one of the best vampire films of our generation.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Always being disconnected and losing credits. Not enough free offers to give you anything to play on for very long
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|As bubble shooters go.  I prefer to not have to pull back and release, but that's my only complaint really.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Is pretty fun but some rounds don't give enough moves. I shouldn't have to be paying all the time and the racoon is very difficult unless you pay.
B001F4UHGC|3.0|ponderous. a studied portrait of a simpler time. my friend and I agreed, the car chase started with high realism. music was groovy.
B0058VA2U4|5.0|This is my first Anthrax album... bought it after seeing it recommended on &#34;That Metal Show&#34;; WOW! It is an instant classic. Not one song to be skipped. Some of my favorite metal bands are Iron Maiden, Metallica, and Megadeth, and I place this one right up there along with my favorites from these other bands (Rust in Peace; Ride the Lightning; Piece of Mind). Not only are the songs amazingly well written (melodic; many time changes; excellent drums and guitar solos), but the sound/production is clear and spacious and each intrument can be heard individually; doesn't sound compressed to my ears (but I'm no expert). The vocals soar. How have I missed this band for the last 30 years?! I can't stop listening! If you like this, check out the last 2 albums from Accept (especially Blood of the Nations). Any recommendations on what Anthrax album to try next?
B00BEIYMTW|5.0|Briefly, my 2-yr-old grandson thinks this is the greatest thing since sliced bread.  Very fascinating for him.  Wonderful little movie with no parental guidance needed!
B004LROUNG|3.0|Another great law drama from Grisham. Good for a relaxing escape from day to day life if you are a Grishsm fan, you will enjoy this
B00BEIYMTW|5.0|Excellent movie. Those who did not like the movie are probably spoiled by the low quality stuff out there. Sorry. This is a really good movie.
B001QXCYZY|5.0|Very nice mic for the price . I get really good vocals using this mic . With it being Usb I can just plug and play .
B00CF34B2I|1.0|it wont even download and it is makeing my  kindle so lagge it sucks and it takes all of ur space
B004ZN9RWK|5.0|Fantastic!!! I've had this on vinyl for nearly 40 years but it was a little hard to play in my car  (:-o).  I ordered this expecting a masterpiece and that's what I got. However, what I didn't expect was a LIVE version included with it!!!! The live version is absolutely incredible and even better than the original. I don't know if this was a special deal or is included in all of the remastered versions, but I would highly recommend seaking out this ablum with the complete Dark Side Of The Moon live version included.
B0039TAHMA|5.0|Its a captivating movie, once you get into it draws you in more. this was the 4th time I've watch them
B004ZNB12O|4.0|Great album with all the classics, only thing better would have been a live version! Shipping was prompt with no issues.
B00AEFYL6K|5.0|Saw the movie years ago when me and wife were dating, thought it was a great movie, with great actors ( Lee Marvin, John Wayne, & James Stewart). Also liked the song by Gene Pitney. So sad that everyone I named is no longer with us. Thankful that we have them on film.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Reading this book is akin to watching Ken Burns masterpiece 'The Civil War' from the '80's. The amount of historical documentation along with insight into the protagonist by Kearns/Goodwin is truly staggering.
B00GINENG0|1.0|The game would be even better if when I pay for more coins, the coins actually show up.. Took money, got nothing..
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. At first I found it a little confusing but then I could put it down. I love how it all came together in the end.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Nice fun read. I didn't know that it is a YA book and with that in mind it was good.  The story is entertaining, moves forward, doesn't bog down. The writing is good to very good. All in all if you like this genre I would suggest this book to you.
B0013WI0PQ|5.0|I wonderful schmaltzy film of discovery, triumph and love lost and found again. A joyful tear jerked! I will watch it again and again
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Great movie. I would suggest this to anyone and will most likely watch it again. The action effects and plot were all well put together
B008Y72UN6|4.0|My 5 year old daughter loved it. It was entertaining for me as well since I grew up watching the Smurfs as a kid. Not a pixar movie but not a bad way to spend an hour and a half either.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|This is a real fun time filler. When I'm bored with nothing else to do this is a good diversion. I like the interface.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Excellent story told by Death.  I hope the movie is as good.  Sad ending. Got to really know and feel for the characters.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love the quality of the game. And it's very addictive. It also relaxes my mind as I get ready for bed. =)
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another hit by Grisham.  Love to see this in a movie.  Great read, can't put it down book, good sequel.
B00006879E|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this album.  So many these days sound repetitive. Every song it uniquely its own. My favorite is &#34;Secret&#34;.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Amazingly Amazing Minions I liv it I think it is the best game of games gdh tug gt hug ggg
B00E8S2JZ4|5.0|I am a geek when it come to anything Tolkien.  Loved this movie in the theatre and am over the moon with all the special features on the DVD.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|this app is soo cool that I love punching other robots and upgrading my robots also get this app it is the coolest
0525478817|5.0|Fantastic all around! Absolutely enjoyed every heart wrenching minute of it! I would recommend this to people that enjoy a good love story, but can take not getting a happy ending.
B00FPX54DA|5.0|These guys are something else. I can't recommend their music enough and this album is definitely one of the best holiday albums out there.
B003NWS5AO|5.0|Great album, Robert Plant continues with his series of under-appreciated superb albums. He's not stuck in a rut, his creativity grows finer with age.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's pretty nice I mean it takes a long time to load but it's fun when you feet to play
B0030ZOYHC|2.0|Do not waste you time if you have not seen and loved the originals.<br />If you never saw the originals, you need to be prepared to have no idea what is going on, while you're constantly being forced to sit through a boy's sniveling teenage emo angst.<br /><br />Honestly, I wanted to like this incredibly drawn, highly acclaimed anime but couldn't, because it was terrible.<br />My memories of the original show were that it started as a great mech anime, with a bit too much Catcher in the Rye complaining, that devolved into a pseudo-intellectual waste of time.  My hopes for this re-cut were high, with the original being visually impressive, and this being an improvedment, but it had two huge flaws.<br />First, they threw you into the world with almost no context at all.  If I had not seen the originals, I would have had no idea what was going on for the first 45 minutes.  I was trying to show this to a friend in first sitting, and didn't stop asking questions.<br />Second, they kept all of Shinji's whining nonsense.<br /><br />The handful of minutes spent on the amazing fight scenes was not enough to make up for the rest of the show.<br /><br />Maybe 2.22 and 3.33 were done better, but I'll never know unless they show up on Netflix.  I'm not wasting another dime on boring teenage angst.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Free should mean FREE this 99 cent thing shouldn't be required so we are stuck on level 23 and refuse to pay toll.
B00ERIUO02|5.0|Another great Katy CD!  Not as good as Teenage Dream, but pretty close.  Fun songs to dance to and relax to.
B009PMEEY2|4.0|A solid match-three type game with some unusual gameplay to make it stand out from the crowd. Instead of 'tap to match' one jewel or object at a time, you swipe to match across the entire matching lineup, which makes a lot of sense and one wonders why it hasn't caught on with more games in this genre.  The rest of the game plays out in a more conventional manner, with achievements to unlock, special &#34;helpers&#34; and other rewards to enhance the experience.  It even has a similar inter-level challenge like the Montezuma games, except instead of tapping on the screen to find 'hidden' pieces you match what's in a viewfinder at the corner of the screen with the corresponding section of the main image.  It works well since it's a little more forgiving about where you tap than the Montezuma version, which is so picky it can sometimes detract from the fun.<br /><br />Graphics are pretty but not stunning and music/sfx are inoffensive and blend in to the background nicely.<br /><br />Overall, a solid performer in the match-x genre and one worth adding to the collection if you're a fan of similar titles.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|If your looking for quality writing this is it. Excellent storyteller very engaging tale.<br />I would highly recommend this book if you looking great story.
B008EL25LE|4.0|This game has the same style of play as the original Azkend, but it's been turned on its side.  Literally.  The original was portrait-only and this one is landscape-only.  Rather than a hiking trip through Asia as the original, this one's on a ship in the ocean.  Same premise applies as the original and many other match-tile type games: you work to earn a piece of an achievement, then work to clear it off the board by swiping through matching tiles.  Unlike the original version, this one has some extra twists to it.  There's fog on the board, which can only be cleared by matching off tiles next to the fogged tiles.  The board isn't symmetrical or a perfect rectangle so pieces don't always fall straight down when others are cleared off.  This requires a bit different thought process from the straight-down boards, which is a welcome change.<br /><br />The most striking new feature (aside from forced landscape mode) from the original is the crispness of the graphics.  It appears optimized for HD screens like mine and the details are stunning, both on the board and in the backgrounds.  It looks very nice and I imagine it will play well on HD tablets as well.  This sharpness and detail is something of a double-edged sword for me, however, as I find it harder to match up some of the tiles because they look similar from a distance.<br /><br />A new audio track with engaging music and even some spoken word segments round out the polish to this Azkend sequel.<br /><br />I can happily recommend the first Azkend game because, despite its lower-res graphics and simpler gameplay, it just feels right on a phone.  This one is a little more cumbersome in my hands and feels less geared towards casual play.  It's definitely right for people who want to marathon through as far as possible in one sitting.<br /><br />One other minor issue is that it seems to be a big battery hog.  I played on an HTC Droid DNA for about twenty minutes and lost about 20% of my battery life.  The case also got pretty warm, too.  It's something to consider if your device has a tiny battery and you're going to be away from a charger for a while.got pretty warm, too.

B00018D44U|3.0|I gave it to a lady friend. Norah is pleasant, but gets boring to me after a while, although a few of her songs are quite sexy.
0060775858|5.0|&#34; . .  .  goodnight air . . .&#34; -- introducing the chilling note of existential angst at an early age. The whole book is a beautiful poem.
B00DHRLK84|3.0|I thought I'd spend the extra money for the 3D and was disappointed.  While I can tell it is 3D it didn't really add to the movie other than give me a headache.  I doubt I'll watch it in 3D again.  So far the only Movie I really enjoyed in 3D is The Hobbit.<br /><br />The movie itself is decent.  I tend to like Brad Pit movies with 12 Monkeys and Fight Club being among my favorites and this one isn't as good as those, but it was worth the money.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I hadn't read this book yet and wanted to before seeing the movie....very powerful story which moved me very much...so now I know I'll hate the movie!!
B00DW1WR14|4.0|I really like this album.  Reminds me of the third and seventh albums.  Song number 5 maybe my favorite of the album.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Not a bad game keeps you thinking and keeps you focused, haven't had any problems yet, just wish they would make the scenes a little bigger so I can see them better, revision may, 13,2016 is it just me on my Kindle or after every scene you have to turn your Kindle around since the update it is a major glitch and it's taking forever for the items you found and the money and stars in the scenes takes forever to get off the screen and you can't even start to look for a new item because you can't click anything
B00GNL96H8|3.0|Kinda boring to see the lack of action.<br /><br />It was more of a documentary than an action film.<br /><br />I think IPO is a good actor, but lacks story line.<br /><br />Maybe you have to be Chinese to appreciate it?<br /><br />Nice and beautiful female actress...lesbian?<br /><br />IPO shouldn't smoke.<br /><br />It was an OK movie, but I wouldn't want to watch it twice.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Used to play on Facebook but used my kindle mostly now so far this is good. Would like rotate and delete function but still not bad
B0054JZC6E|2.0|I didn’t really use this app. I just downloaded it to try it and I don’t really like it. It wasn’t very fun.
B002UXRGLG|5.0|From an educational stand point DVD’s by the BBC narrated by David Attenborough is sure to please both old and young viewers alike. I own several films produced by the BBC and have found them of exceptional value. Life is a 4 disk set that covers some of the filming that was done to produce great films like Planet Earth and Seas of Life. I recommend you add this one to your collection.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I give this a 4 out of 5 because I use it for school all of the time and it works great for that.
B00C061I3K|5.0|i love love love this CD, especially Instant Crush, Within, and Lose yourself to Dance. i recommend this CD to anyone who likes electronica, a little bit of funk or even Daft Punk
B003YY7BTW|4.0|I give this a 4 because I liked this movie. It was a cute movie even though I can't really relate to it.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie for its story,  adventure, and moral and ethical challenges. The fact that it was filmed in North Carolina was a plus also!
B0064BCNA4|2.0|I didn’t really use this app. I just downloaded it to try it and I don’t really like it. It wasn’t very fun.
B005CWRB44|3.0|I don't like how it screws to turn on. Too easy to have on or have the parts separate from eachother.
B0095R64AO|4.0|This is a cute movie. I don't like how the characters were constantly sleeping around with other people though. That makes movies pretty sleazy.
B00ABGEFWC|2.0|This game is extremely glitchy and loses in game currency constantly. Support is no help, they either ignore you or give you the run around for months. BEWARE!
B0064T6LV8|2.0|I didn’t really use this app. I just downloaded it to try it and I don’t really like it. It wasn’t very fun.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Usually I don't endorse a product but this one is quality and deserves the time.  The cord that came with my Kindle was flimsy and quickly broken so I couldn't charge it any more.  This one it heavy duty and works well.  I don't see that happening anytime soon.  Only had it one week but this is the second time this has happened so I figure I should know.

B005BGBPBG|4.0|I give this a 4 because I remember liking this movie. I just don't remember what it was about at all.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Pros:<br />-Good battery life and can charge while using<br />-Very useful buttons on the headphones saves a lot of frustration and sets these apart from others<br />-Mic quality is excellent<br />-7.1 surround sound makes games and movies sound awesome<br />-Programmable keys especially nice when listening to music away from computer<br />-Range good enough for inside my house without dropping<br />-Software is intuitive and only took a few minutes to set up and get working<br />-Comfortable for long periods of use<br />-Great value for the money<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Power button is annoying (very minor)<br />-Base is weak even with tweaked EQ settings<br />-Max volume isn't very loud<br />-sound quality isn't outstanding<br /><br />Sound Quality: (6/10)<br />-Bass: It seems like trying to compensate the lack of quality base they made it more boomy and muddy in doing so. The decay seems to linger and distort the overall quality of the sound.<br />-Mids: Mids are a bit better than the bass, although when listening to music distinguishing separate sounds in the mid range is not clear and slightly muffled.<br />-Highs: Good strong highs with quite a bit more clarity than the mids and bass, but still not excellent.<br />-As a whole: The sound as a whole is enjoyable and adequate for 95% of people. If you are looking for an exceptional pair of headphones to listen to music, then look elsewhere. They don't excel in sound department but I find them good enough to listen to music on without being bothered by it.<br /><br />Other Thoughts:<br />These are not Audiophile level headphones, but 95% of the people buying these know that already.<br />After doing extensive research I found these to have the best value.<br />Alternative Wireless headsets with better sound quality jump way up in price. (There are some decent wireless headphones with similar cost and better quality but no mic)<br />One concern I had was background noise. This is not an issue with these headphones.<br />People may tell you that &#34;7.1 surround sound headphones is a gimmick&#34;, although I find that it makes playing Battlefield a whole new experience. Before it felt like every other game, but with the surround sound switch turned on I really get immersed in the game and actually feel like I'm hearing these sounds around me. Although when on Skype with friends and surround sound is on it makes them sound &#34;like god is talking to you.&#34;<br /><br />Since these use a USB DAC, Windows 7 doesn't have support for two default playback devices (The g930's and speakers from onboard soundcard) When switching I have to open up the sound options and select my playback device or unplug the USB DAC.<br />Really wish Windows 7 had this support by default. I'll have to find another way to do this.<br /><br />My brother got these and had to exchange them after the battery stopped charging.<br />I only recently got mine, and have had no issues with them so far.<br /><br />A very good investment if you are looking for a wireless headset. Nothing else compares when looking at features to price.

B007HACDLK|5.0|I drug this book out as long as I could, knowing it would probably be the last Mitch Rapped story. I would read. This book has all the twists and turns we have come to expect from Vince Flynn and he always manages to take us to regions of the world- like a travel-log. I will miss Mitch.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Although this isn't the first time I am reading The Hunger Games, I was still kept on my toes and longing for more now that it's over... I love book one and now I'm onto book two to continue the trilogy. I recommend this book to anyone seeking a breathtaking, exciting, intense story for people of all ages. The storyline always keeps you engaged, and it also makes you so thankful for what you have, while making you wish you had the love that Katniss and Peeta share.<br />I will always love this book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a awesome game. I love how they change the background for every holiday. So what do you think about it.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Great book, loved the ending.  You can't put it down, she does such a good job with each unique character.  Their lives weave into one another from one lie.  She does such a good job describing the hurt of losing a child and how the not knowing of how she dies leaves a nightmare that continues for year.  There is a blessing is knowing the truth.

B00B7Y0206|4.0|I really like this app! You can watch videos in HD and search for them easier. Also, for $2 you can download videos which is very good when your not in a WiFi zone! The only reason I would give it 4 stars is because it glitches out A LOT. Sometimes you will not be able to watch videos or download videos but all you have to do is uninstall it and 're-install it. Not a bad app at all, although I do recommend getting the full version!

B00C5R7B0I|5.0|I am rating this 5 Stars because people don't read the one star ratings.  This book is ZERO stars an shame on the author.  I started reading this book and found myself in total shock by the end of the first chapter.  Why would this author think that it is ok to use a real tragedy that took the lives of innocent school children in her fiction novel?  I am in complete and utter shock that she would this.  I think she should be shamed into donating the proceeds of this work to a scholarship fund for Newtown school children.  I am speechless.  I don't intend to remain speechless because I intend to contact every media venue that will listen.  I have read every book by this author, but the first chapter of this book is the last one I will ever read by her.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I love this game!I've been playing for a couple weeks now and there is only one problem I found,that to sea trade you have to connect to Facebook,and I don't have a account set up yet. So it would be nice if they could remove that so I can trade.

B00902UH5M|5.0|I had always been a huge fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger and his movies. As a kid, I would always go to the cinema see his latest action movies, it was the eighties with massive number of action movie stars and Arnold and Sly were the legends. It also facinates me the power of will and persistence and Arnold set an example, a farm boy from Austria that could have gone to the presidency of the United States if the US constitution permitted. He came to America empty handed and built a successful career. His book describe very well how he rose to fame and prestige. It starts talking about his early origin back in a small town village in Austria, his vision to become the most muscular man in the world in the hope to be invited to come to America and start his movie career. The second part talks about his movie career and his romantic life, including early love and how he knew his former wife and his relationship with the Kennedies. Probably Maria's family influenced him to enter the political arena and pursue public service, the book talks about his time as governor of California. There is a chapter called &#34;The Secret&#34; where Arnold talks about his child he had with his maid. Finally Arnold writes a list of recommendations he would give to people succeed in life based on his life experience which I found very informative and deep at times. A must read book if you are a fan or enjoy learn the story of people who persevere, have a mission and simply make it happen and become a success.
B00GH4R95C|5.0|This is the best Superman EVER.  The plot is plausible; the characters are not two-dimensional defuses; and the special effects are terrific.  The fights are like actual fights.  Well, they're what you imagine an actual fight of that nature would be like.  I'd watch this again already, and I saw it just days ago.
B0000CB7RC|5.0|While nothing can (or should) efface memories of Lauritz Melchior, Frida Leider, and  Kirsten Flagstad, for a complete and uncut version of Wagner's massive score this is the performance to beat.  As Isolde, Martha Moedl (the German Maria Callas) is the antipode of Flagstad's cool regal splendor, being a woman afire with sizzling passion from the moment the curtain rises; her cry of \\"Ach!\\" when Tristan dies in her arms is heart-breaking.  Her voice is in its absolute prime here, without eh wear and tear that became so evident in a few more years.  While Ira Malaniuk as Brangaene will not erase memories of Margaret Klose or Sabine Kalter, she is an effective foil to Moedl and likewise sings with clear, steady tones.  Ramon Vinay as Tristan is a powerhouse of dark-voiced virility and anguish, with his trademark ueber-baritonal timbre well suited to the part.  Hans Hotter is a paradigm Kurnewal, and Ludwig Weber a deep-and warm-voiced King Marke who immediately wins one sympathies.  Herbert von Karajan, in his second and last year at the Bayreuth Festival in 1952, has complete mastery of every bar of the score in a taut, energetic performance.  This performance has been issue many times before on LP and CD, but Orfeo -- with its  access to the original master tapes -- once again sweeps the board with the best sound remastering and deluxe booklet notes.  Any self-identified Wagnerian who does not own this set forfeits claim to that title -- this is an essential acquisition for any opera collection
B00EVW04PE|4.0|Pretty good action adventure.  The only problem is, if you've seen &#34;Olympus Has Fallen,&#34; this looks like it's poor cousin who has fallen on hard times.  In any event, it's definitely worth the price of a rental.
B0081336FO|5.0|The series is highly riveting. Between the clever and engaging dialogue and the complicated and twisting plot one never gets a chance to breathe for fear of missing a vital clue.
B00FLNQBTK|5.0|Soooo funny.  And that's not something I say lightly.  I laughed out loud, again and again.  Great writing, terrific performances, new and imaginative plot.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|My problem is that I keep trying to get more playgrounds but it keeps saying a problem occurred please try again so I tried again but it says the same thing over and over again. But besides that it's a good game. Please fix Amazon I beg you!!!
B00F91SCXC|5.0|The ONLY zombie movie worth watching.  It's scary because these zombies are FAST!  Plus, there's a good mystery in it, and plenty of twists.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's amazing great game to waste time it's very challenging and fun this game isn't a waste of time it is actually entertaining
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Great special effects; great characters; fun plot -- this is the &#34;gold standard&#34; for action / adventure science fiction movies.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love the series. Couldn't stop reading from the first book. I am excited to see the new movie. Wish there were more books in the series.
B00FWLSLJ4|3.0|Good action and special effects, but the premise was kind of lame:  a massively expensive weapon that can only be operated by two people who form a Vulcan mind-meld?
B00BL9860K|4.0|While I enjoyed the read, I didn't think this one was up to David Baldacci's highest standards. I look forward to more in the series and hopefully the two former spooks will get a good case to solve.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|I began this book based on a great review, and the first half of the book did not fail in its excellence. Eloquently written, I was completely engaged by Victoria's story, the descriptions of the flowers, and I rooted for her to work through her issues. I had wild fantasies of becoming a foster parent and helping those children. I was so enthralled in this book that I was thinking I would buy copies as x-mas presents for my daughters. Then, the unbelievable began to happen. Our heroine, Elizabeth, who is patient and kind to a fault, suffers a dramatic and debilitating one-day episode of clinical depression on THE DAY she is set to adopt Victoria. Huh?? And by the next day is up and running and ready to reschedule in 6 months? Sorry, that was ridiculous.<br /><br />Victoria, then begins to behave wildly as an 18 year old when she discovers the kind, gentle man she is with has gotten her pregnant. Rather than tell him, she races off determined to have the baby solo with no prenatal care and no plans for how to handle the baby when it arrives. As bad as this is, it only worsens when on two occasions she leaves the baby home alone so that she can escape and spends one night sleeping in the park nearby so she won't have to listen to her daughter's cries. By this point it is clear that Victoria is mentally unstable, and the character became incredibly annoying. As a final insult to her daughter, she drops her off at the father's home, who is unaware she exists, around the time she thinks he will show up. She leaves the baby there alone, with a gas burner turned on so that water will boil and the moss she has draped the babies basket with will stay moist! She races away in her car before he arrives home not knowing if he is in town, coming home that day, or if she has burned the house down!<br /><br />At this point the book was so draggy I thought I would have to stop reading it. Because as ludicrous as Victoria's behavior is regarding her baby and relationship, she is smart and savvy enough to observe a couple and see whether the marriage will last and thus grows her strong bridal business. Astute with human psychology, she has no ability to look inside herself. It is simply unbelievable. I could go on, but won't.<br /><br />What I did like was the language of the flowers, the brilliant writing style, and I felt she offered a fair ending to the story. I found myself hoping Grant would not take her back, although I felt the exchange with Elizabeth was fair. My assumption is that because of her severe instability, she will walk out on her daughter again at some point. No one that does the things that she did, can change overnight - as the book seems to imply.<br /><br />This book is interesting, and if you can tolerate the character during her pregnancy and early weeks as a mother, you may find a lot to enjoy. If you have difficulty with unrealistic character, this book would not be a good choice.
B001TODCII|4.0|Purchased this as a gift for my husband.  He will  receive it for Christmas.  I have viewed this movie already and enjoyed it.
B00CNQ7G5G|4.0|I really like this book, although I probably won't finish it. I have about 50 of Gardiner's cantata recordings and other works but I am not a musician and don't read music. The book is a wonderful synthesis of historical information on Bach and Gardiner's intuitions derived from his intimate knowledge of the music, especially the choral works. But I can't &#34;hear&#34; the music when Gardiner describes it, and I can't read he notes he shows.<br /><br />This book cries out for a total multimedia treatment. When JEG mentions a phrase or musical element, I'd like to be able to click and hear it. I've been to one of his lecture concerts and to several of Helmut Rilling's and that's whee I really learn. I'm really sorry the book can't quite give me that.<br /><br />All that said, I really like this book. I recommend it to anyone who's willing to deal with the issues.
0881889148|4.0|I've only had a chance to try a few songs from this book so far.  My initial impressions are as follows:<br />Some, but not all of, the arrangements are very complete, even including solo guitar parts.  However, there is a glaring omission of lyrics and melody in The Night Before.  Where the song is supposed to be &#34;We said our goodbyes (Ah! The night before)&#34; and similar passages, it just has &#34;We said our goodbyes (blank)&#34;  Fortunately I have another song book (from the 1960s) that has the complete version of this song.  Also, I was disappointed that the book does not include &#34;Roll Over Beethoven&#34; (originally by Chuck Berry), even though it has a number of other songs that were written by others and covered by the Beatles.
B00459EZLW|5.0|Like reading a cool SciFi/fantasy novel where the underlying theme is about networks killing off TV shows like mindless drones set in force by some unknown beings from long ago. Maybe there will be a rebirth of this show after the suspended animation wears off.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Wonderful book.  Daughter and I read it together.  Interesting narration and historical setting.  A book that should be read to fully understand what was Europe during WWII.
0316055433|2.0|I have seldom been so disappointed in a book.  Not only did the hero/loser/whiner/idiot never become likable, by the middle of the book I couldn't understand how he had managed to stay alive and actually didn't care if he did.  Talk about your mother fixation. Let those rave as to content, the mix of drugs and art didn't appeal to me.  I had trouble believing this was the same person that wrote The Secret History.  That would have been a good place to stop.  Abysmal.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Another King story that I could not put down until the end. Riveting, adventurous and written in the style that makes it Stephen Kings. Would recommend it to everyone especially avid King readers
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|Fun and simple!! A great game to get some frustrations out!<br />It's the best time I've ever had at the beach!
B000LXQVA4|5.0|Our LO loves this and uses it every day. I wouldn't go over 20-25min at a time, as they get tired. Toys that are included are basic, but they still keep baby's attention. It was easy to assemble, doesn't take too much space and it is easy to clean. Make sure that baby is on toes when using the jamperoo, as if they are flat on feet they will get tired easy and the product is not meant to be used like that. There are 3 settings for height.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|HE LOVES IT AND LISTENS TO IT ALL THE TIME.ONE OF HIS FAVORITE CD'S...HE LOVE'S BLACK SABBATH AND HAPPY TO HAVE THERE COME BACK CD
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|A good basic calculator and it's free.  Large, easy to use display.  I have not had any issues when using it on my Kindle FIre HD.
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|One of my favorite movies!  Don't assume it's a &#34;chick flick&#34; and don't wait for Christmas to watch it!  Pair it with Nottinghill for an evening of a visit to London.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|you will love this app .gameloft creates awesome apps this app has amazing graphics I love it. this game I would recamend this app to any one. from Paige
1250038820|5.0|It captured so many examples of city life, humanity, normalcy...  Just delightful and clever.  This would make a great gift--especially for friends in other countries.
B008Y5T5ZE|3.0|Strangely interesting premise made this an interesting movie to watch. We will never see book dealers in the same way again.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|For a very funny screenwriter, this book should have been much, much better.  Unless you're a die-hard Fey fan, you might want to skip this and spend the money on her movie &#34;Mean Girls.&#34;
B005544TRQ|4.0|This has some very clever and interesting plots (with a couple twists). We really enjoyed watching, looking forward to more.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|My 6 year old son and 32 year old husband both work together on this game. They are trying to work out strategies and figuring out how to get more guns. They really enjoy every minute of it. It's great to see them having so much fun together. It's a game for all ages.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|At times the book is difficult to read, and at times the words fly from the pages.  Every emotion, love and hate, fear and comfort, happiness and sadness are dealt with in this book.  Ultimately, the ending leaves the reader short of breathe, because to breathe would be to grieve.
B007EDYN36|5.0|Picked this up after reading Nothin' to Lose and Ace's, No Regrets. For me this was the best of the three.  Peter pours his heart out. Drugs, sex, failed marriages, money and his perspective on the personalities that made for a  dysfunctional band. A must read for the fifty something KISS fan.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|For the cheaper flat panel TV's that don't have built in wi-fi, this product is a no-brainer.  Easy to install and easy to use.  My daughter even installed the Chromecast app on her iPod Touch so we can use that as our streaming source and not tie up the family laptop.  $35 for the hardware and $8 a month for a Netflix account = movie nights on the cheap!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so fun and I love playing it! Some of the levels seem completely impossible, but then the next time I play it, I win!
0316055433|5.0|I've been waiting 20 years for this book.. I was as captivated by this book as I was with her two previous. So sorry to have it end?
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Hilarious!!
B00BWQW73E|2.0|I was thinking this was similar to the Jobs book, however there are too many references to people and not much story line.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|A stellar followup. Must start book 3 now! It does divert from the TV series in good ways. It seems more consistent.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I started playing just to see what it was and got hooked !!!  I love the variety of different games to play and I never get bored.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is the best way to make what you want! I will rate this game!<br />It is the best game ever since the beginning of the time I download it!<br />minecraft is the best game ever! I am impressed of the survival mode!

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So much fun!! I'm so happy that it is now on the kindle and I don't have to be on my phone!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's pretty entertaining. Keeps your mind stimulated, ticks you off,but all in good fun.but when you pass that level you've been stuck on forever....priceless
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Great graphics and detail. This game is seriously good when you consider that it's free. I can't stop playing untill I run out of energy.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|You soil this is so awesome you should get this game and it is online but the bad thing is that you need internet to play single player
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This is a good game because you can fight robots. Also you can buy upgrades to make your robot stronger a best app ever played.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love puzzles and this app is perfect for me!  I don't have the room to have puzzles out, so I only do a puzzle once a year.  Using this app let's me work a jigsaw puzzle anytime I want! It's awesome!!
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I did not like this game  as much as Candy Swipe.<br /><br />I did not like this game too much. Maybe because I'm not feeling well tonight, it seems a little complicated.<br /><br /> I give it 2 stars.
B00GLX1MG6|1.0|The acting is horrible and the language is very dirty. With the F word used almost very 3 sentences on average in addition to other foul verbiage. What is with Hollywood and the constant chatter of foul language in the movies of late. Are they saying that this has become the normal language in society?? Or are they trying to make people begin to use this obscene language? I couldn't take it and after 20 minutes of this storyless, foul language movie had to turn it off. Jennifer Aniston is well known in this foul language lingo, horrible bosses being another similar one.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|The best thing in the world your able to control and watch what ever you want which best applies to me
B00BM9XL72|5.0|One of the band's masterpieces, \\"Tomorrow The Green Grass\\" SHOULD have been a massive seller in the U.S. but the lead single \\"Blue\\" got little airplay (although it did become a top 40 hit in Canada. Ironically, it DID became a minor hit for the band that recorded it and toured with The Jayhawks following its release--The Thorns) and the album did not do as expected contributing to the departure of founding member Mark Olson (although he later returned to the fold over a decade later).<br /><br />The band mix their country-alternative-indie rock sound here combining them with strings in a manner that would have made Gram Parsons proud.<br /><br />The 2 CD deluxe edition of \\"Tomorrow\\" is a gem expanding on an already great album. Let's start with the sound on this reissue as it will be of particular importance given the often badly compressed remasters that have appeared over the last decade. Vic Anesini weaves his magic doing a nice job of remastering this important album. It sounds better than the original release to my ears.<br /><br />The first disc is expanded with 6 bonus tracks (one of them hidden at the conclusion of the album):<br /><br />1.\\"Blue\\" - 3:09<br />2.\\"I'd Run Away\\" - 3:33<br />3.\\"Miss Williams' Guitar\\" - 3:06<br />4.\\"Two Hearts\\" - 3:22<br />5.\\"Real Light\\" - 3:25<br />6.\\"Over My Shoulder\\" - 3:40<br />7.\\"Bad Time\\" - 3:26 (Mark Farner)<br />8.\\"See Him on the Street\\" - 3:09<br />9.\\"Nothing Left to Borrow\\" - 3:24<br />10.\\"Ann Jane\\" - 4:00<br />11.\\"Pray for Me\\" - 3:39 (Mark Olson/Gary Louris)<br />12.\\"Red's Song\\" - 3:58 (Mark Olson/Gary Louris/Marc Perlman)<br />13.\\"Ten Little Kids\\" - 4:33 (Olson/Louris/Perlman)<br />14.\\"Tomorrow The Green Grass\\" - 3:35 (non-album b-side from 1995 single \\"Blue\\")<br />15.\\"You And I (Ba-Ba-Ba)\\" - 4:35 (previously unreleased)<br />16.\\"Sweet Hobo Self\\" - 3:08 (previously unreleased)<br />17.\\"Last Cigarette\\" - 3:24 (non-album b-side from 1995 single \\"Bad Time\\")<br />18.\\"Sleep While You Can\\" - 3:51 (previously unreleased)/\\"Blue From Now On\\" - 2:47 (hidden bonus track; previously unreleased early demo)<br />13.\\"Ten Little Kids\\" - 4:33 (Olson/Louris/Perlman)<br />14.\\"Tomorrow The Green Grass\\" - 3:35 (non-album b-side from 1995 single \\"Blue\\")<br />15.\\"You And I (Ba-Ba-Ba)\\" - 4:35 (previously unreleased)<br />16.\\"Sweet Hobo Self\\" - 3:08 (previously unreleased)<br />17.\\"Last Cigarette\\" - 3:24 (non-album b-side from 1995 single \\"Bad Time\\")<br />18.\\"Sleep While You Can\\" - 3:51 (previously unreleased)/\\"Blue From Now On\\" - 2:47 (hidden bonus track; previously unreleased early demo)<br /><br />Each of the outtakes does nothing to diminish the original release and, in fact, only enhances it. It's clear that The Jayhawks were at the peak of their power for this recording. Guitarist/songwriter/singer Gary Louris plays a number of muscular guitar solos that give additional heft to the material.<br /><br />The second disc is comprised of the \\"Mystery Demos\\" that circulated for years among hardcore Jayhawks fans. There are occasional sound imperfections here but that's due to the recordings themselves not to the mastering and they are minor issues.<br /><br />The second disc consists of:<br />Disc 2 \\"The Mystery Demos\\" (all tracks previously unreleased):<br /><br />1.\\"Pray For Me\\" - 3:42<br />2.\\"Won't Be Coming Home\\" - 3:50<br />3.\\"No Place\\" - 4:56<br />4.\\"Precious Time\\" - 3:29<br />5.\\"Poor Michael's Boat\\" - 2:54<br />6.\\"Ranch House In Phoenix\\" - 4:51<br />7.\\"Cotton Dress\\" - 3:14<br />8.\\"She Picks The Violets\\" - 3:58<br />9.\\"Bloody Hands\\" - 3:45<br />10.\\"Up Above The River\\" - 3:47<br />11.\\"Over My Shoulder\\" - 3:33<br />12.\\"Blue From Now On\\" - 3:18<br />13.\\"Hold Me Close\\" - 4:32<br />14.\\"Turn Your Pretty Name Around\\" - 4:01<br />15.\\"You And I (Ba-Ba-Ba)\\" - 5:08<br />16.\\"Red's Song\\" - 4:29<br />17.\\"Nothing Left To Borrow\\" - 4:06<br />18.\\"White Shell Road\\" - 4:07<br /><br />All of these are acoustic demos with some violin parts. Some of these did end up on the Olson/Louris reunion studio album from a couple of years back in finished form while some have never appeared anywhere.<br /><br />The packaging is very nice as well. The release comes in a tri-fold digipak with a booklet featuring two essays with one focusing on the album proper, the band's history and the second focusing on the \\"Mystery Demos\\" second disc.<br /><br />An essential album from the 90's gets a terrific 2 disc reissue and finally gets its due.<br /><br />Highly recommended.e of years back in finished form while some have never appeared anywhere.<br /><br />The packaging is very nice as well.

B00AESN8XY|5.0|Beautiful design a must buy for everyone, but i would recommend 12 or older because  to fully experience the game you need to be smart enough to understand what it means
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I loved this book, which shows the incredible cruelty and heartfelt compassion humans are capable of.  A truly sad yet hopeful and uplifting story, but has a haunting, unsatisfying ending.
B00DHRLK84|2.0|Wasn't as entertaining as I thought it would be. I was pretty bored throughout the whole movie. Nothing against Brad Pitt he's a good actor but the plot was lame in my humble opinion. I'd avoid this movie if you're looking for action thrillers you won't see much action here.
B00E9A656K|3.0|Its just ok. you cant fine tune the gearing and shift points like drag racing.<br />Drag racing is a better game.
B002OTO38K|5.0|Amazingly written, directed and acted. Felicity Huffman rocks as Bree, Kevin Zegers steals your heart and Duncan Turner is voice for the ages. Loved this film!
B009KS4XRO|2.0|game freezes after winning big.  if you looking for something to kill time and don't care if you win or loose then I suggest to buy.  But if you want a game that gives you what you deserve after winning, this one is not it.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Like Google Drive Sync, Google has released another product that is not ready for prime time. The Chrome plug-in worked for approximately 15 minutes before stopping.  After that, I could not even mirror google.com.  Prior to that, I tried to mirror Amazon. Cast does not support Silverlight of QuickTime.  The Chrome plug-in also caused the Chrome Browser to cover my task bar.  Yes,their own plug-in broke their own product.  Google support is terrible.  They seem to think users want to search forums and submit logs to improve the bugs in their products.  Official support provides mostly useless basics. I give 2 stars only because it was 35.00 and if you need for Netflix or Hulu it will work.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Highly recommended. I think that whether you are a novice or expert strategy gamer, this is the best I've seen on an android device.
B00EKJWS1Q|4.0|It works fine for getting email on my Kindle Fire. Just don't like to have to click away from an ad every time I open it.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|Loved the quirky humor throughout, even in the super suspenseful parts.  Such a unique story line and Rose was just perfectly awesome.  I would however caution readers - you may have a really hard time putting this down.  I couldn't and stayed up way too late on a work night.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really love this series. I recommend this series because of the action, the happiness that comes with reading this series about Katniss Everdeen. This is truly a great read for ages 12-Adult. You never want to put these books once you start reading them. Great job to Suzanne Collins! I guarantee a great read! It will keep you on the edge of your seats. May the odds be ever in your favor!
B004QX07G4|4.0|Entertaining and funny, just like Ellen. But I really wish I had gotten this one on tape. I feel like it loses something not being spoken by Ellen.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|Never knew how convoluted grain industry is. Good read. Eating lots and lots of grain is not your friend. I have told my friends about it now.
B001ANSS5K|3.0|Interesting idea but I felt like the ending didn't live up. Some slow points in the book made it difficult to get through.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is SOOO fun!!! I can't stop playing it. I suggest for people to play the hams and see the movie.
B00CH3DBNQ|4.0|This is an important, true story, and well worth reading.  It was sometimes repetitive and not beautifully written, but real.
160774418X|5.0|My admiration for this author/chef knows no limits.  Really.  I've been cooking out of Ottolenghi's \\"Plenty\\" cookbook for the past year or so at least twice a week and it's changed the family's eating habits and appreciation of good taste astronomically.  So when this newly published cookbook (from the restaurant menu) was published in the U.S., I was interested.  At the same time, I wondered how the newbie could improve and/or expand on the author's two previous (and terrific) books.  I shouldn't have been the least bit skeptical.  \\"Ottolenghi\\" is even better than its predecessors and chock-a-block full of great new food.<br /><br />I come to this opinion from the perspective of someone who cooks almost exclusively vegetarian dishes.  \\"Ottolenghi\\" is about two-thirds non-meat in content.  Lots of terrific new vegetable entrees and sides, with the usual emphasis on freshness, herbs, nuts and Middle East/Mediterranean spices.  What's really new in the author's approach in this cookbook is a generous section on desserts (most of them adaptations of classics) and many recipes for sauces that can be used with a lot of different entrees or as dips, spreads, etc.<br /><br />I'm just getting started in using this new book--and in fact started with dessert!  How does chocolate chestnut bar sound?  A kind of exotic brownie, but richer and creamier than the traditional approach.  Killer taste.  The same chapter includes a fine recipe for a more traditional brownie, but clearly better, judging from the ingredients.<br /><br />I'm a total fan of this guy and his books and have been giving them as gifts for the past year.  I even gave one to a Moroccan friend who is a wonderful cook, but who became an instant admirer and regular user of Ottolengthi's \\"Plenty\\".  So get the new one or at least one of the earlier books--it/they will change your life.

B00F91RYL8|5.0|World War Z was scary, it had me jumping out of my chair a couple of times. The twists and turns make it very interesting. Intelligent and not your usual zombie movie. A must see.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Drug a little from time to time, but stick with it, it all ties together. Also Mr. King is wrong about men openly carrying pistols on their hips in Texas in 1963, illegal then as well as now. Has been since 1876. VERY GOOD BOOK. That's my report......
B00F35BV64|5.0|Wonderful, exciting movie from start to ending. The characters stay true to the original series but the special effects and action make it all that much better. Khan is superb and will be an interesting villain in future movies.
B00EVW0SA0|1.0|Too bad it can't be rated no star. Posing vs acting, running around, gymnastics, and a lot of blow em up blue screen. Self indulgent directing. Waste of electricity watching it, lost self esteem renting and watching. Glad it was a virtual rental and not a disc - would've  made it into a coaster.
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|Exciting and interesting new take on the Superman series. A little slow at times but picks up considerably towards the middle. Looking forward to the next movie.

B005L38QHA|2.0|I got this for my gf because it was a good looking gaming mouse licensed by Blizzard and it was a cheaper alternative to the razor naga, which I should have bought instead. First off it's wired ,a wired mouse for 50.00? I should've known better. All of the buttons wiggle and don't feel secure like on the razor. The main two mouse buttons on the top are integrated into the top shell and you have to press down quite hard to get them to work. The light effect is a gimmick they should make the  mouse shell color something neutral if they are going to add a light you can change (the colors on the shell are orange and black so most of the colors clash unless you're using orange) it's probably worth more like 30.00 I feel like I got duped but she seems happy with it, I think just to be nice. I should know better than to trust anything blizzard is behind. btw she only uses it for WoW.
B00D6DVSAE|4.0|Sting goes back to his roots in the shipbuilding north in this album.  Almost a folk album, but with his usual gifts with words.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I have hoping that there would be a Real Steel app, but I never thought it would be so awesome !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00EVW0SA0|1.0|This is absolutely the WORST movie I've ever seen. The writing is utterly infantile. The subject matter is sub 1st grade level. Unreal.
B0058S0OMS|5.0|Great film even greater in HD!!! If you love the classic Halloween series then you just have to buy this one!
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|It's a fun way to spend 5 to 10 minutes. That's about how long it takes to use up the free lives.
B000UR9QHQ|5.0|I saw this this Halloween and boy was I happy! The movie looks great in 1080p and sounds fantastic! There aren't many special features but there is a documentary about scary movies narrated by Dr. Loomis himself which makes it worth a look!
B001KH56I8|1.0|This was a real disappointment - I've never read Palahniuk before and I wouldn't want to again. Having seen Fight Club multiple times I was expecting a book with a brain but instead I got worthless sexist drivel, which (ironically for me) merely repeats various tropes from Fight Club:<br />Example1: The protagonist picks up women at sex addiction workshops much as the protagonist in Fight Club hangs out at support sessions.<br />Example2: The plot twist at the end of both book revolves around a dramatic identity surprise.<br />Now if it was just the case that Palahniuk was recycling ideas, well that would be one thing. But the other thing is that the book is really sexist. Now, I've read Sade and Bukowski, I feel that I can separate out a character's point of view from author intention. And i don't feel that I'm easily shocked, but I found this book unpleasant in its general treatment of women. That's not OK.<br />Unsurprising then that there was a film version of the book which apparently was also sexist-<br />[...]<br />(And if the Daily Mail finds something sexist well that's worth noting).<br />After identifying the \\"the sleazy sexism,\\" the film review ends up by saying: \\"I can only imagine that the Chuck Palahniuk novel on which it's based is better. It could hardly be worse.\\" Unfortunately the book is also rubbish.
B00G8P2B4E|3.0|Well once again a sequal that did not live up to it predecessor. The story line did not keep my 5 year old interested. He had been begging for the movie but he started wandering around the house after it started. I asked if he liked it and he said &#34;not really&#34;.
B000G6R7B8|2.0|The watch is too slow. It loses about one minute per week. I have to readjust the time every week.
B003G4W49C|5.0|One of the best books I have read. I enjoyed it in High School and have found that every time that I pick it up that it is still engaging and fun to read.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|This was a great read! I thought it was going to be &#34;just another teen love story&#34; but it's almost an anti-love story. There's also a bit of mystery in this book, which makes it a page-turner! Really enjoyed it. John Green captures the teenage heart perfectly.
B008FRFN7A|1.0|cannot figure how to get it to download. there are no places to click on to get it to load????? if someone knows the key to this let me know. might be very good, just do not know.<br />dan7656@columbus.rr.com

B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game never disappoints, it will give you hours of entertainment while still providing an enjoyable challenge. Very addicting, play it almost every day.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I have to admit, it wasn't the hardest, most in-depth, but the idea, the whole thing, just blew me away. Definetly wayy up there on my bookshelf. The writing is kind of easy, but you don't notice it at ALL. You don't even care.You<br />just<br />have<br />to KNOW!
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|One of the best match three games out there. Worth every penny. Lots of lvls and very challenging.I would highly recommend it.
B0009HLD0K|5.0|Classic!  This movie is a typical underdog story with a happy ending.  A true feel good classic movie for the whole family. You may find it a bit boring if cycling is not your thing.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game has some of the most creative vehicles and tracks I have ever seen.<br />(The rally car is way better than I thought)
1608955702|4.0|This is a good book.  It is written well, with plenty of examples.  The important meta-data is included with each example in the book.  After studying the book, I happened across the author giving a lecture on YouTube at BH Photo.  All the same information that is in this book, is on the video, but better yet, the author explains each shot with greater detail.  In my opinion, watch the video, and save it to your favorites for reference later.  Here is the link to the video [...]

B009ZQC7MY|4.0|It would be 5* except for Amazon's lame offering of Abbey in standard def and charging a premium for HD.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Can't wait to read the next book! Catching Fire was action-packed, suspenseful, and left me wanting more! Don't want to give away any of the plot twists.
B00CDTSQZW|4.0|This show will grow on you, even if it is not what I would call historical.  Had to have the blue-ray so my wife and I can  view again before new season... also to share with friends.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|So awesome no problem with it. Getting update today. So you should get the game.And make update with half built death star
B000TEPL92|4.0|Richard Marx is one of those talents , that stands out all by himself...  wonderful voice and great writing. Also great attitude and humor in live performances.
B008X8P8A8|5.0|Awesome.. it is almost as good as regular total war. It is very good and the graphics are good. Kids 10+ can do this.
B008M4MB8K|5.0|I can watch Blade runner once a year for the rest of my life!  Maybe a bit of dementia will let me enjoy even more often later on.  Read the longer reviews if you are not familiar with this film.  Great film for teens and older to appreciate . A Big Fan.  SCI-FI at it best!
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is so fun. I cant stop playing. it is worth the money but I didn't have to pay since I got it from the cloud. me and my sis love to play together.
B00FXMGI0G|2.0|This is just an ok movie, the first one was better for sure. The acting is ok, but the script is really weak. If your bored its ok, but don't expect to be thoroughly entertained
B00AFROVQC|5.0|Could not put it down. A great story with wonderfully developed characters. I can not wait to get started on the next book in the series.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|This series was very well written and so descriptive that I could actually picture what a post-apocalyptic Chicago (or any other large city) might look like. The character development was fantastic and all the characters stayed true to their personalities  throughout each book in the series. Although I typically prefer a happier ending, like any good novel, this series deals with real-life struggles such as betrayal and loss, which makes it that much more relatable. Even though this series is young adult appropriate, this 44 year old loved it!
B005LAIH54|5.0|I loved this movie.  The acting is wonderfull and the action keeps you on your toes. It is funny, dramatic and the visual effects are good. This type of movie is right up my alley.  Sometimes this type of story line is unrealistic and looks fake but they did a great job on this one! I barrowed my sisters copy and  loved it so I had to purchase my own.
B003YNFYD8|3.0|The &#34;Red&#34; and 'Blue&#34; albums are nice collections, but they leave out too many great songs. &#34;I Saw Her Standing There&#34;, &#34;I'll Follow the Sun&#34;, &#34;Here, There, and Everywhere&#34;, &#34;I Will&#34; (Never heard of it? It's on the White Album. Don't feel bad; Mariah Carey never heard of it either), &#34;Julia&#34;, &#34;Martha, My Dear&#34; - just to name a few.
B00F35BV64|5.0|I rented this on Amazon Instant but I will need to own this movie.  Sequals are rarely as good as the first but i have to say this one may even be better. I love Chris Pine in this.  The role suits him well. I enjoy the mix of comedy and drama and it is well done.
B0013KTGAG|5.0|Sunshine is one of the best science fiction films I have seen in a long time. Actually, just one of the best films I've seen in a long time.  A friend of mine had told me about it as being an underrated film and after the premise was explained to me I had to give it a view. The plot follows eight astronauts and scientists aboard the Icarus II spacecraft on its way to deliver a stellar nuclear bomb to hopefully reignite the fading sun and save humankind. As the film progresses, the morality of the crew members clashes as key decisions to the success of the mission must be made. This film is visually amazing, has a score that complements it perfectly, and creates the right atmosphere for each scene. The characters were played well and had great development. The complaint most people have about the film is about its scientific accuracy and its latter third. Being a science FICTION film, there are many things I can let slide, but there of course are those parts of the movie that make you go &#34;Oh come on!&#34; The latter third of the film is what makes this film almost perfect and not perfect as it takes a very unrealistic approach to create the most tense parts of the film. That's all I'll without spoiling anything. All in all, I still give it 5 stars as more of a rating compared to the other science fiction films of this era.
B000I186FW|2.0|This is one weird movie. VERY unrealistic and mental. The acting is average and the story line is weak and weird .
B00992CF6W|4.0|Great time waster for long car rides or if your just plain bored It's just pure awesomeness My only problem with it is it need a to be updated I will give it a 5 star once it has
B000I62JBE|3.0|Edward Norton's role was amazing.  It is an old movie, so that must be why the picture seemed a little muddy.  All my other videos from Amazon have been much clearer.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The characters in the story are suprisingly dimensional.  Parts of the story are a bit predictable but takes an interesting but believable twist.  The last chapter of the story wrapped all the pieces nicely
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think it's a good game but can you make the price lower. Also I think there should be a new update on minecraft pocket edition.
B003YL4L0W|5.0|Standard Picoult.  She researches the topic well and presents all sides within the given character's viewpoint.  I always know Picoult is a dependable author telling a good story.
0810997827|5.0|I bought these for my grandson.  He absolutely loves them.  He has had these books for a year and is still reading them over and over.
B00BWQW73E|4.0|Very interesting and informative. The recent controversy about the book create some factual uncertainty. But overall a very  good read,<br /><br />As a reader who is a customer of Amazon and a consumer of books about major business leaders I found the book a good portrayal of Jeff Bezos and the company. The reality is something, as with any history, that may vary from the story. Several themes came alive to me in the book:<br /><br />First Jeff struck me as a visionary entrepreneur. Not unlike Steve Jobs although Bezos has a a more systems focus than Jobs did. Some reviewers point to the author underplaying Jeff Bezos' sense of humor and compassion which may be the case. The clarity of drive, focus, and vision all came through.<br /><br />Second, in chapter 10 the author presented a memorandum that Bezos wrote describing companies viewed favorably and unfavorably, and certain traits as being cool and others not cool. That section was fascinating and I could see the concern Bezos had about the varying perceptions. Amazon is a company that does not fall in any clear category, unlike Google, Apple and Walmart which I think he correctly categorizes.<br /><br />Amazon has some character strengths, juxtaposed with some character traits which create fear and discomfort. The service capacity, the breadth of products, and the ease of use all make it a strong web destination.  The portrayals of competitiveness, of working conditions and the extensive use of customer information are all areas that create disquiet.  Two differences between Google, Apple, and Amazon as portrayed, are the long term visions of the entities and the user/customers' comfort with those visions.  This is reflected in their mission statements - not compared in the book - but which may explain, in part the image discussion in chapter 10.  Google focuses on organizing the world's information and making it useful and not doing evil in its vision statement; Apple focuses on bringing the best computer experience to its users. Amazon focuses on building a customer-centric website where people can find and discover things to buy. While all three companies are commercial and profitable entities the value construct and purposes differ. Amazon's growth and ever increasing size creates a sense of disquiet as the mission's value context is commercially focused.<br /><br />Third, the book clearly portrays Amazon as a company with tremendous growth potential. Bezos's ability to keep control of the company's vision even as it grows is very impressive.<br /><br />As stated in my opening, the book is an excellent piece of work. It does not glorify or vilify Amazon but leaves the reader with thought provoking questions about the organization and its impact on economic interactions and the future of commerce.ence to its users.

B00515M23M|1.0|I just bought the Kindle edition of this book. Admittedly, at 99 cents I shouldn't have expected much. But I bought it principally to read Poe's well-known story &#34;The Gold-Bug.&#34; The first thing I noticed is that the book has NO Table of Contents. Okay, I have a way around that--it is a Kindle book after all. So I did a search for several variations of &#34;Gold-Bug.&#34; The result was three references to the work but not the work itself.<br /><br />So this &#34;Complete Tales and Poems&#34; does not contain one of his best known works, &#34;The Gold-Bug.&#34; Maybe it is not considered a &#34;Tale.&#34; Pathetic!
B0068TJLSY|5.0|I have always loved the twists and turns of a Spielburg movie. It ties in government secrecy, and how they twist information to the masses.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I am in love with this game. It is really an addictive game and fun. Quite challenging. You won't regret purchasing this game.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I have been waiting for this game for so long it is the da bomb takes a while 2 download but it is awsome u should get it
B00G25VQFA|4.0|If you are a James Blunt fan this album will not disappoint. I really enjoyed it, something I can listen to over and over again. Good for a trip in the car or sitting at home with a glass of wine.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game keeps me occupied for 10  min. Or hours .what ever I need. Great graphics I'm 38 .I love it .daughter is 10..I. She started playing mine. Now she has it ..And loves it
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|35 dollars : 350 dollars worth device. Casting your chrome window to you TV is an amazing experience. You can watch anything on your chrome window and cast it to the TV with sound. Amazing.<br /><br />Youtube, netflix and pandora play nice, spotless .<br /><br />Best thing, power it from your plug, then cast something from your ipad/iphone/android/laptop , it will switch on the whole tv, sound system all with out pressing another button.. all for just 35
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I Love this game I play it a lot  I have heard many great reviews. My friend requested it to me I just love it!!!!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|It's the best one.I have tried them all,I just wish people would just play and enjoy and not moan.if you don't like the game don't come back. I love it
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Sooooo addicted!!I love it!!((-:I always play this app almost everywhere I go!!no problems!!appRock!!can't wait to get more life's!!hmmm!!I got to go to crash some candy!!
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I enjoyed the series on PBS and wanted to have the DVD set so I can watch it anytime.<br />It will become one of favorites on my special shelf in my library.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Great read! Anne is a great character and you really feel for her. Read the white queen first . I can't wait to read the white princess
B003WC5EQI|4.0|Yes, like many who have written, it is a tragedy. It is hard for us to conceive of more tragic circumstances but there are, and there were such times. In this story the victim is Tess, and her naivete was abused by one man who changed her life forever. Her life full of misery came as a result of this one action perpetrated against her which followed her the rest of her life. Living in such times as a woman was not easy. She bore the guilt and shame. The second man betrayed her as well and when he came to his senses it was too late. Their happiness only lasted a moment. I blame the men and I did become disgusted with them. Poor Tess. But it is only a movie (and a novel). Thank God we don't live in those times. Thanks Thomas Hardy!
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Great sequel to Enders Game but a totally different book than Enders.  It's just plain good Sci Fi for those of us that like real Science Fiction and not bed time stories.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I have really enjoyed this game. It is fun and exciting to play. I would recommend this game to my friends.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Good book but not one of his best. Perhaps I would have liked it more if I had read the previous book which included these characters. If you are a Grisham fan, you'll like it. I found it enjoyable but it took me much longer than usual to get through it. It did have a decent ending.
1451666179|4.0|Like others have said, I felt that, while I was excited for the book, it contained a bit too much self-hatred and self-berating and it felt uncomfortable, to say the least. As a person suffering from depression and similar problems with self-worth, it was a bit too triggery to be enjoyable as a work of insight in her life.<br /><br />I would give it a 3.5 if I could - I chose 4 stars instead of 3 because I really do adore Allie's blog and what I know of her through her stories. I sincerely wish her all the best and as much recovery as possible.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|The first book in years that I just could not put down. Stayed up until 2 AM to read. Highly recommended but make sure you have some valium ready if you read it late into the night because you are not going to be able to sleep without some.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This was an interesting book. The twists and turns keep your attention. The plot develops quickly and the book becomes hard to put down.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|I half read this book in high school. I remembered practically nothing of it. It is wonderful....funny, sad, profound, absurd, tragic. A jazz account of a devastating time. And so it goes....
B00454U1NS|5.0|Came in when promised.  New condition.  The songs on CD were great and I have enjoyed listening to the CD.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|What a great movie! It held my interest all the way through and was delightful to watch. I love movies with twists and surprises throughout!
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|This app has everything I need.  It has multiple alarms, you can set songs as your alarm sound and it repeats as often or as little as you need it.  Great alarm app.
B00FLDG52I|3.0|I have the Blu-ray and am not happy with the quality of this product.  The audio & video are out of sync.  The video and audio quality could both probably be better but I can live with that....the out of sync is VERY annoying.  Great performances from the usual suspects...just wish the disc performed better for the cost of the package.  My 3 is generous due to the sync issues.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Like the review I provided on Apple's App Store, I must say this is one great improvement. I played Asphalt 4 Elite Racing on a 2nd gen iPod Touch, but now this one, Asphalt 8, looks amazing on an Android device. It looks better on a Kindle Fire HDX (currently using), than on a 4th gen iPod Touch. Good job as alwaysGameloft, but my how things change.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I bought this movie and I really like it, I received the movie in perfect conditions, very nice. I'm so happy
B00D1X0576|5.0|It work great, easy to use and responsive. The test run well without any problems. I recommend other to use it.
B000ID37RM|5.0|Grew up in the south during that time period. Gregory Peck and this marvelous group of actors brought a difficult and painful truth in our history to the screen in a gentle, but forceful way, which has left a mark on American cinema, and that of the entire world, as well as our hearts. I realize not everyone will share the same opinion, but even after all these years, Gem, Scout, Dill, and Atticus Finch, still hold a special place in my life.
B002WJI63A|3.0|The overall size was a little lacking, but my daughter is gaga for them. Either way I'd give it a 2 1/2 star rating.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|I don't usual like to play games but my boyfreind told me that I would like this one and he was right mostly because its more of just thinking then real playing. but I live this game its I wouldn't say fun but enjoyable.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I really love this game. I go it because I love hunting, it's fun and challenging. I'm really impressed with the graphics.
B003Z0BWRM|1.0|Still laughing. What a joke.<br /><br />The publishers have realised that most of their audience are so retarded this rip off of every single pop culture IP will sell milliions.<br /><br />JK Rowling and Joss Wheddon should be the first of many to sue for breach of copyright.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Couldn't put it down!!!! Many twists and turns keeping you guessing. Never knowing what is going to happen next. Great read!!!!
B009NXD6JM|5.0|This is a classic movie. Great soundtrack and costumes. Sound quality is greatSo glad its streaming on HD, I highly recommend people to watch it.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Enough strategy to keep me interested, but not so difficult I get frustrated. A good game for when you want a distraction, but don't want or need to be totally engrossed.
B007F5SG22|5.0|A remarkable story. It is enlightening, informative, provocative, emotional and should be a must read for all politicians, women and high school students. Yes I know that won't happen, but if we lived in a perfect world the book would never have been written. The book is written to help women and it clearly demonstrates that tolerance is not always the best option. But it offers so much more. Just read it and then get others to read it. Truth is a powerful weapon.
B00GH4R95C|4.0|This is a pretty good movie.  Easily the best Superman movie yet.  None of the cheesy &#34;Ah Shucks&#34; Clark Kent stuff.  Many people complain about the end fight, but what would you expect from beings with these powers?  In my mind, it showed a realistic sense to it.  Much like the newer Batman movies, it strived to provide a real feel to the movie.  You throw a tractor-trailer at your enemy and you miss, it's going to hit a building.  I don't know why that upsets people.<br />Overall, much better than Superman returns.  And far better than the awful Reeve Superman.
B0055PMJMW|5.0|I've been through most of the Harry Bosch books and ate them up.  The short stories are all great and these three are no exceptions. Only problem is that the end comes way too soon.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|A great look into a sound school with old time tape recording and editing.  A must for music/ sound engineer types.
B000OCXI3K|5.0|One of my favorite movies. We have watched this again and again, and referred the movie to our friends who also watch is again periodically.  Binoche and Depp at amazing!
B004G0SJU8|5.0|An sxcellent and moving love story, although a bit cheesy at times. The actors were good and their was good chemistry between Nicholas Cage and Meg Ryan.
B000FCKC4C|4.0|Exceptionally well written. I was very interested in the main character's journey and the outcome.  Very good book that every adult should read.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Beautifully written. I laughed out loud, I gasped out loud and I shed many tears reading this delicious book. Thank you, Mr. Green, for sharing this masterpiece with the literary world.
B007712XAU|5.0|I watched both seasons in about 2 days' time.  Then we streamed Season 3, the UK version is the best by far.  I can't wait for Season 4 to come out in the US so we can continue to saga.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is a great game lots of cool looking guns and lots of upgrades very good graphics and a lot of blood.
B00G4I1CLS|5.0|very good movie everyone should watch at least once i have watched it 3 times. (thumbs up to the camera)
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|I really enjoy Family Farm Seaside.  I will plant some and then come back when I'm DONE reading and harvest.  When you need to do an update on Kindle Fire.  Just delete the app and then reinstall it.  You will not lose anything.  It is really a fun game.<br /><br />If you need a neighbor look me up FAUIVEF.
B004ZN9RWK|5.0|I have always been a big fan of Pink Floyd. I have listened to parts of The Wall. The Dark Side of the Moon has always been one of my favorites because I can associate it some with the Vietnam War.
B00E9A656K|2.0|This app would be much better if it had much more to it.  All you are able to do is push the gas pedal and shift over.  It is pretty easy to win.  I just wish that there was more of a challenge to be more entertaining.  The only good thing about it is that the graphics are perfect!  They are kind of mesmerizing:)
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Good story, a little predictable though. Easy read and well worth the time. We will see what book-club thinks of it.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|I got very angry when i was playing this game, because i had gotten to world three, and i had to go online to search something, and when i got back, everything was deleted!
0446556726|4.0|good story with good interplay among the characters ...of course harry is at the center ... but ends too seamlessly and cleverly once the plot line becomes obvious
B00EDLP6O2|5.0|This game is fun....works great on my kindle. Graphics are cool.<br />Tutorial helps you learn how to play the game.
B00F57VFXO|5.0|Descriptive depth of characters, plot and scenery made for an excellent read! I'd describe it more as historical fiction complete with loads of action and intrigue, the shining moments for me being the two sword duels which read like a blow by blow account. While a work of fiction, I loved the detailed descriptions of  the war machinery at the time and had me researching items like the history behind the Sikorsky helicopter which I was unaware of prior to mention in this book. A great book I will be adding to my favorites, I only wish it were available in print so I might purchase it for my father this Christmas as he might be \\"old school\\" but he clearly would enjoy all the WW2 references. Excellent!
B00FF8OKJE|1.0|Great game but when you go to make a rubie purchase to make upgrades to your castle the company is unable to correctly process your orders and you don't get the rubies you need to keep the game going and it begins to self destruct.  By this I mean soldiers you paid for begin to desert your castle for lack of food.  You need to build a bakery and upgrade farming which guess what?  Cost rubies.  Too bad they have this problem and the follow up was non-existent.  Terrible customer service.  Not worth the money or the aggravation.
B00007KWHG|5.0|I've always like Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons...over many decades.  I will have and play this until the end.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|When I first got my Kindle Fire HDX it worked perfectly. It completely stopped working about a week or two ago. I have uninstalled it from my device, reinstalled it and it still says the same that others have commented. It tells us it has stopped working. I definitely would not recommend people getting this app. Not until they see reviews saying it is back up and running. Very disappointing.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am an avid reader, and this book is very poorly written. This seems like 6th grade English. In addition to the poor writing, the story is bad. There is nothing sexy about a controlling and borderline abusive boyfriend. I am by no means a prude and am all for changing it up in the bedroom, but that's where it should stay. Using control in other aspects of the relationship is not okay and I don't see why a woman should be flattered by it or be willing to stay with someone like Christian Grey. Hotness doesn't make up for all of that. Waste of my money as I had to read all 3 because I can't leave an unfinished book. Also the sex was very unrealistic because I don't know many virgins who enjoy their first time or who are so willing to try all the things our young Ms. Anastasia does so early in her sexual experiences...Now I'm done
B00AFROVQC|5.0|Great book. Kept me interested and wanting to see what happened next. reading second book in the series now Soon to purchase #3.
B004W1GCNC|3.0|Slow to build, feels a little disjointed. Enjoyed the original series much more, but a good attempt. I'd recommend Downton Abbey over this if you're looking for historical british drama.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|The series is everything it was advertised to be, and I couldn't be more pleased.  A very nice bonus is watching each episode commercial free.  Thanks for having such a great product available for all of us Columbo fans.
B00821OX98|5.0|All the action of walking dead without the whining. Realistic acting making real decisions rather than bumbling about. Story keeps building and moving. Is there a video game?
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I love BB up until July 2013 when they were bought out and the new owners made it much harder to win and also there are items in every new room which cannot be gifted or traded.  I seldom play any more.  Bingo Blitz took a fun game and made it stressful to play all because they want people to buy credits to keep playing.  I stopped playing for a year previously and had I known the changes that were coming, I wouldn't have bothered to even start back!  Nobody is happy with the new way of playing and they are losing players.  No one in my family plays much any more at all, if at all.
B00471TLZS|5.0|Classic!!<br />Although it's a horror movie it also have many comical moments.  It's a must see movie that you will enjoy for sure!
B001L9OKZK|5.0|Love the movie and the book as well.<br />I hope the rest of my family will enjoy it as well.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This device works like a charm. I can now watch my you-tube videos on my big screen. The only complaint I have is that sometimes the picture stalls / stops casting mid-stream. But it does not happen often enough for me to care.
B003L77G6A|5.0|We love the Big Bang theory. Hysterical show. Lots of good laughs. Kept us entertained for several nights. Love this show.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|this is a great app for the kindle.  I have used it a few times I like that it fills most of the screen and very easy to use.  Free so you can't beat the price.  The value is very good.
B009IH0ICG|5.0|I always thought that a charcoal chimney would be a waste of money, but I read about them and decided I would try one.<br />If I had known, I would have had one years ago. Quick, effient, no lighter fluid mess, just crumble paper, fill charcoal, lite and relax.
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|I wasn't crazy about this app. My granddaughter liked but got bored with it quick she is 14. I found it fun for a little bit but I got bored with it pretty quick also.  I think that someone who likes this type of hunting app would like it.  The graphics are great and it is easy to use.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun times. Creative and very very addictive game. A lot of hours spent. Hoping for more levels in the future.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I couldn't put this one down. Found myself reading into the wee hours of the morning just to find out what was going to happen next.<br /><br />This is one of Grisham's best to date.
B009UNH0EM|5.0|Exactly what I wanted! Excellent value. I will be ordering again as soon as I need more accessories. Yes [...]
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|So good! I could not put it down ! Some of it .i figured out but definitely a big surprise ending! Do not miss this one!
B007R11DKQ|1.0|Everyone always says, &#34;the book was so much better&#34;. I don't always agree, but in this case, &#34;Everyone&#34; is dead right. The book is great and, thankfully completely different in a very good way than this. Very much worth reading and is a quite enjoyable experience, compared to Hollywoods, &#34;rewritten around a conference table adaptation&#34;. Ugh.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Kept me up to date on the storm. Only issue my phone app says Pittsburgh and I'm an he away from there.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is amazing. I will read it again and again to experience the poignant joy, the ethereal reality of it. Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters are spectacularly human, and they make you love them without trying. John Green, you've scarred me, that's okay. Okay. Okay. (Read it! You'll understand!)
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|This was my first Lauren Oliver book, and I must say was quite enjoyable. I am in love with YA books, just can't get enough. I loved the character development and am anxious to see what happens in the next chapter of Lena's life! I will say, the only downfall of this book was some of the language in certain parts of the book, it wasn't horrible and there wasn't too much, but it is worth mentioning as that is not usually something I run into in the books that I read. But don't let that stop you from reading this book, it's a good one!!
B004Q7CIFI|2.0|Like going on a road trip with your family to Disneyland and days later you don't seem any closer.  May be a better book if there was never a focus on 'the big event'.  The writing and concept was fine, the main characters were fine but I got discouraged by the slow progress.  Lots of things happen but it doesn't feel like progress.  I may have to go back and finish this book but has been put away for months.
B005LAIIQC|3.0|This is the type of film that really makes you question the intelligence of the people in Hollywood, and what they want in a film. Did they even know the film they had? It was an above-average, thinking man's suspenser. So many of the scenes were done really, really well; a tad wordy, perhaps, but none of the frenetic pacing and cutting, the pounding music of the previous efforts.<br /><br />All for naught. And a savvy theatre-goer knows exactly when the film is going to go off the tracks: when whatever secret agency that is after Renner/Bourne contracts the Asian to kill him. Goodbye. Totally unnecessary, 20 minutes of ridiculousness ensues. They could have -- w five minutes work on the script; saving millions!!  -- just as easily have ended it in the factory, which, w its mass production of pharmaceuticals -- can you say human error? -- was creepy enough.<br /><br />I've never been a big fan of Weisz's, but this is the best performance of hers I've seen. Another actor I don't particularly care for, Ed Norton, so often it seems goes through the Ed Norton motions, but here he is good. (He was good in Frida, too.)<br /><br />And did I miss something? Or did the producers? The shoot-up in Weisz's house, following her interrogation by the severe woman and the heavy, a nice scene: but the woman never gets it. I kept on expecting her to jump from a closet. Will she in the sequel?
B004XZR63M|4.0|A great book, easy to understand, even for a financial novice like me! If you need money and how to make it work for you, look no further.
0762445262|1.0|it advertises a 48 page book, and i did not get it. my grand son will be heart broken...thanks for ruining Christmas
B005SCSL56|5.0|I fell like this is a fabulous book. It expresses the near of imagination while it shows how important love and kindness are to the world. I chose the five star rating because I felt that nothing is more important than the life lessons it taught, and the quality of the story is impeccable, but the story shows how great we can be.
B00E7Z7D2M|5.0|This album is rich, lush and full of emotion.  it has jazz which is brilliantly blended with hip hop and soul, making it an experience from start to finish.  It took me on a journey and which felt more like a movie.  None of it is predictable commercial pop but artists flowing freely within their gifts and their spirits.
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|Love this game have had no problems so far x<br /> So would purchase more games like these thank you fot
B0074JODEY|5.0|If this was the 6-film version, I'd give it 6 stars, but for now this one will have to do. Shintaro Katsu's involvement with these films-- he played Zatoichi and Wakayama is his brother-- is what initially drew my interest, but the quality of the first three films more than has this series standing on its own. Its violence, which caused it to be banned in many countries initially, is somehow both excessive and refined, bloodily poetic in both theme and imagery, but it's the father-son relationship that is the literal heart of the series.
B00GCE3TCE|5.0|The descriptive material was just fascinating.  The characters are believable, entirely so.  I've never read anything so sad, but it didn't get me down.  I read the book real slowly to soak up the meaning.  Found I had to think about practically every word I read.
B007JNR4WI|5.0|I think, to date, this is the best work Travolta's ever done. Unlike his basic-but-superb one-note character portrayals (&#34;Fever&#34;, &#34;Michael&#34;, &#34;Swordfish&#34;, &#34;Arrow&#34;, &#34;Paris&#34;), his character here actually transforms from an everyday guy to an extraordinary guy while never losing the &#34;gee whiz&#34; quality of the everyday guy. Solidly backed by Whittaker, Duval, and Sedgewick, Travolta's portrayal is complex and heartfelt while maintaining the understatedness that makes this film a gem.
B003O86FMW|5.0|A riveting and fantastic read for entertainment and enlightenment. Collins explores the horrors of a potentially dystopian future while endearing the readers to her characters.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Everything about this game is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  There is over 20 robots to fight with.  It's just awesome.  You can also upgrade your robot.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|One of my favorite books ever.  I like reading military books and this story is absolutely incredible.  It forced me to think about the humanity, principles and honor of all people--not just those in the military, but also those who find themselves thrust into a terrible situation through no choice of their own.  I wanted to be educated and forced to think about the situations we find ourselves in.  This book did just that.  Very thought provoking.  Having a close relative in special forces it made me respect what he and his family go through in the life they have chosen.
B003Y74AZ2|5.0|Great case, I have had it for a year and it hasn`t stretched or got damaged at all. Great feel and arrived quickly. Thanks Amazon!
B00E8B1P9M|2.0|Lame. I love The Rock, and Bruce Willis, but Channing Tatum is killed way too soon and with no fanfare or class.
0763644765|4.0|This is a really cute book. I only allowed my son to have this book if he was on the potty.  He looked forward to reading it while doing business. He waits for my facial expression for the &#34;WHAT'S THAT&#34; page, and is also excited for the &#34;HORRAY&#34; page! We did not need it to help him begin using the potty, because he has known how to use the potty since 9 months old--just not potty trained to ONLY go there. It helped to show baby got to wear exciting underwear instead of diapers!<br /><br />Although adorable, there's not all that much to it.  I add words to the dog/cat pages to explain that they have different potties.  I also would have liked the book to be smaller for a toddler to handle.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|After installing a few useless apps that I soon deleted I was left with a lot of old files that needed cleaned out. A few taps with this app and it was done! Everyone should get this useful application.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I think it's amazing. I highly recommend you buy this app. It can be addictive though. I of all people can say this  game is great for kids,because I'm am a kid. Great game and it  free get it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game. Wasn't sure what I was supposed to be doing at first. Was very quick. Would recommend for those who enjoy hidden object, puzzle, problem solving type games.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Doesn't have any glitches or anything! When my mom plays it on her phone it always haves glitches.... the game is so much fun!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I have read dozens of books and most teenage books are only good in the beginning before it gets cheesy, and that is when I set that one aside. But this book while a sad love story, keeps you fixed to the very end of the book. And when you get to the end of the book, you cannot help but wish there was more to the book. To see how it continues on. But sometimes it is best left unknown.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I love this game is absolutely fun. I love anything to do with medieval times. The medieval times rocks all the way.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|It is fun and not too easy or hard to level up but the music is kind of cheesy though.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like it because it's kid friendly and adults can play it too also it is very cute and similar to the movies!
B00G3HSF7O|5.0|I Laugh at all the long winded critics ... someday they might understand the story ... GLAD I BOUGHT IT !
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I cannot find anything wrong with this game. Except for the wait to do things (like craft items), it's perfect. Anyways, the wait isn't that long and it's not like it was unexpected for a game like this. I recommend that you get this game.
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|my wife and i love the cd and really want to buy the rest of them they are great yay
0345525558|4.0|Really liked this book. It was different with the use of the meaning of flowers to communicate.  I would recommend and look forward to other novels from this author.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|this is one of the greatest movies in the world i have loved it ever since the first time i saw it it was like new and came on time
B0091WNK8M|5.0|Delightful family move, a must for rainy days. Enjoyable by all ages!  Focus on taking risks in the face of adversity, overcoming fears, and good old fashion adventure
B004T4LUPW|5.0|Great calendar app, full featured and comprehensive. One of the few that allows quick searching of entire calendar database and not just the 3- or 6-month period that Google Calendar lets you search things for on usual devices.
B00GB7GX20|5.0|The soul of her voice coupled with the modern day sounds of Sia and Rihanna have made me listen to this album at least 50 times over the first 3 days.
B005R32L66|5.0|Love to be able to talk to my family in England for free.  Have Skype on my phone and two computers, love it
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Just a fun time with actors from my generation. Lots of action, not graphic, gruesome or overly bloody. Reminded me of the Bruce Willis movies like Die Hard.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|I am fortunate enough to be able to travel quite a bit, and always check Trip Advisor first before making any reservations.
B00BAXFECK|2.0|I know I am in the minority by only giving this book two stars but so be it! I am an avid reader of all kinds of genres of books and frankly, this is one long, depressing, cumbersome novel.  Yes, the writer is talented but honestly, 800 pages of the same thing over and over again. I agree with several reviewers who felt Theo should just get over what happened to him.  If you like a totally negative and relentlessly depressing story line, then this is the book for you.  If not, save your money and buy something fun like &#34;The 100-Year Old Man!&#34;
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|it is awesome who ever comes over to my house they want to play it.When I play I try my hardest and win.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game but I wish that they would let you change your realms name.  This is just because I need a few extra words.
B00FOWX6NM|1.0|I will return this one. The clear back part is extremely worn and scratched and looks as if it was used for a long time. Not sure why a product like that can be sold. Such an unethical business conduct!
B00B7Y0206|1.0|This app wont install and all it does is go to my Cloud. Im trying to get it on my Kindle Fire but it wont. HELP :(
B007IXWKUK|5.0|My wife and media made a lot of fun of this series, but once you get past the crappy beginning of the first book, this lady has you hooked.  Sure there are dirty parts for the mommys out there that don't get enough love from their husbands.  I found the book to be great and gave me a metric to shoot for in life.  I may not be lean and mean like Christian Grey, but I'm round and ready.  HooYAH!
B00BAXFECK|2.0|was interesting in the beginning... i'm stuck at 80% 3 hours left and have lost interest. first time this has ever happened to me. the story got very boring and tedious.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|One of the best. John Grisham writes like a gourmet eats--plenty of tasty morsels and only the best that's on offer today.
B008JGSM6G|1.0|I got this app and I loved it! For the first day. The next day it wouldn't open. I tried and tried it just kept &quot;loading&quot;  I am very frustrated that I could only use it for one day. I was also upset with all of the in-app purchases. I don't want to pay for hints! If these were fixed I would love it. PLEASE FIX.  :&lt;
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome and so addicting, when you start playing it it will be hard to stop playing it. It's a lot like temple run but way better, more fun, and cooler. If you don't like it then you're missing out a lot of fun.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|I not only love this CD, but I also love the organization and all the good that it does in the world.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Didn't think this app would be that great but was happily surprised. A great game for the horse lover or enthusiast.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Awesome game, but it gets a little frustrating not being able to play for several minutes as a penalty for screwing up.  No wait, that's what makes it even more enticing.
B005USZYDU|5.0|This is a great book, no swearing, no sex, just very interesting story line about a 13 year old kid and his desire to one day be a lawyer. Filled with intrigue and mystery that you will enjoy reading!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app!! I have so much fun when I play.<br />My horse is so so so so so so cute!!
B00785P2QC|3.0|To get it out of the way it's very annoying when their is a requirement to subscribe to stuff to earn cards and new missions. I wish their is just a free.play mode so you can do whatever you want. But it is a good, fun and unique game that I recommend!
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Whether you are an educator, politician, parent, or just avid reader this is a must read. Completely unexpected and exciting revelations of the human condition. Every section gives pause for reflection. You will come back to the stories again and again.Be prepared to start discussions sparked by every chapter. T will be a wild ride. Good luck.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|This is a Great App u can make any picture your own way u want too it is so great
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|This product is a fun and easy to use app that is great for learning or perfecting a language. I would definitely recommend it.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It is a weird and funny game that you are a minion you run and get stuff you can only upgrade certain things at a time
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|A lot of fun and easy to play yet challenging and fun! I keep it up on my Kindle and play at least once a day. Recommend.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Really enjoyed this book, I loved that it wasn't the kind of ending that most people thought it would be.  Also loved the depth of the main characters.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I don't see why this is addicting I really don't like these games because there boring just to tap pieces of candy
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|I dumped this.  The ads aren't worth the content.  Unending, annoying ads that got more frequent as time went by.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Great series...be sure to read it before the movie comes out.  The series was a little like Hunger Games, but yet different. I loved the action and the romance.
B00CEF014E|5.0|My expectations were low until i turn to the first page. Wow! What a Nerve wracking read. If you're the thrill-seeker type and you love adventures, Solstice is just for you. Twists and turns where you least expect, and i couldn't stop flipping the pages. I don't want to spoil it for you, wait till you download this on your kindle.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Super fun and enjoyable! Definitely keeps you interested. Can't wait to battle some friends. I like that there seems to be a lot of different things top accomplish.
B001C3FR5C|5.0|It is a time capsule for the mood and feel of the end of/post Vietnam era. Human life is extremely valued and there is a touch of concern about overpopulation in the future. It also captures the feeling of the exuberant dreams 60's being slowly crushed by a new emerging realism.
B001E8WNNO|3.0|I didn't like her. The car I mean. Christine is so mean, I couldn't understand why she was so brutal. She would have mowed down a baby in the road. I like killer car movies, but I couldn't find any redeemable features in this film. I watched it with about 5 other people and they loved it. Hey who knows, you might be a Christine Lover.
B00GH4R95C|4.0|This is a steampunk equivalent remake of the Superman franchise. It almost achieves escape velocity as it tries to center on the emotional aspect of the story. I think it doesn't quite make contact because the back story is too comic book. The might could have broken this and achieved buy-in if the back story had been from the view of the saved victims and they had spent a little more time making the story of Superman as a boy a little more gritty with a little less cliche family tragedy. It was a good try though.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I like the desktop version better. I feel Plants vs. Zombies needs to be played with a mouse for complete comfort.  &#34;Zippity-Dodaa-Finger-Flipping&#34; of the mobile units makes it a bit painful, for me anyways. This is a topnotch classic though. I know you will like this one either way you play it.
B0061C1NQ6|5.0|Gorky Park is a wonderful book. I admire a few murder mystery writers but Mr. Smith creates a world so foreign but so real and characters so original (but not bizarre) that reading his work is like reading nothing else. The problems that are dealt with by the main character aside from discovering &#34;who done it&#34; are an education in the complexity a society can develop when nothing really works.
B004U8VWLE|1.0|Some people absolutely hated Natalie Portman in this weird film. Oh yuck, like what is her problem. Her mother is one of those women who would make you want to jump off a building, because she is a control freak, and likes to catch you being really personal with yourself. I wished there was a real huge Black Swan and would have come after Portman and her Mother.
B00BU18U82|5.0|My son absolutely loves this app and he will not put it down.  It is fun, entertaining and most important educational.  I will give this app the A+ because it it teaching life skills while they kids think they are just playing video games.
B00574P9EQ|3.0|Some people like these kind of &#34;kid movies&#34;, where growing up is a real thrill. I happen to like these series. I don't see where they are so wimpy, and I would like to see some geeks who like science and gaming in these films. After seeing this one, I do want to see the next one in the series.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|It is a GORGEOUS product ... &#34;IF YOU COULD GET IT TO SHUT OFF!&#34;  It can be more of a problem than a solution.
B00BUVPIRS|4.0|After playing Aralon S&amp;W through (partially twice, then all the way twice) I realized two things that surprised me: one, that I LOVE RPGs and two, that it's kind of a good thing to share with my grandson (yep, I'm over fifty and female!) and talk about ethics and responsibility.<br /><br />Ravensword is different in several ways. The control interface is different and while it took me a bit to get used to it (after spending an embarrassing amount of time on Aralon...) I came to like it at least as well. The story's simple, sword and sorcery with no frills, but nicely drawn. The levels are gorgeous, the creatures are beautiful (except the kobolds, which are just creepy). I love the orcs and the goblins! :))<br /><br />Since these were my first forays into RPGs, I needed a little help, and got some invaluable tips from the developer's website and from a review (the person who pointed out that you could go to the Goblin Ruins as many times as you needed to build up coins and experience points saved my virtual butt!) I loved the horse in many regards, particularly the fact that it didn't throw me every time I came close to a rock or tree. The one thing I really missed though, was the occasional endless treasure chest. That is something that makes the time spent gathering experience points pass more easily.<br /><br />I give the developer huge credit for the beautiful world, a good story, and generally very good graphics (watching the giants fall in the northernmost part of the island is rather awe-inspiring). There are a few things lacking and a few things I might change if I could, but overall, it's a great game.
B00F2HW20M|4.0|This is a fantastic presentation of Steve Hackett's work with Genesis, staging the pivotal role he played in the band from a deserved central role. He features the most important compositions he co-wrote throughout his career with the band; you will witness his fantastic guitar playing, close and personal. He is accompanied here by a phenomenal set of musicians, who are able to replicate faithfully, and even enhance, the chords and riffs in the original versions of the songs; Roger King conveys the power and spacy transpersonal experience provided by the keyboards; Gary O'Toole shows his mastership of the drums, in an awesome display of sheer talent; Rob Towsend adds his touch with the flute and saxophone, while Lee Pomeroy creates the foundation with his superb bass and guitar playing. Nad Sylvan, an interesting character, sound eerily like Peter Gabriel at times. He is a very good singer, yet his theatrics while attempting to evoke an original Gabriel often end up, in my opinion, as a caricature. Nevertheless, he ends up fulfilling his role in the band well enough, considering the large shoes he was expected to fill. The invited guests make there contributions, some barely satisfying, but most providing a nice variety to the show. The cinematography, camera work, and editing, are exceptionally good; the sound is superb.
B00FJTYDKK|1.0|Movie would not load. This is not the first time we order a movie on amazon instant video and we never get to watch it...
B00DE76PM8|4.0|when I downloaded it and try to start it my kindle fire locks up and had to be removed bad
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|It did not work very well. It was marginal at best. I would not recommend it.  I am going to return it.
1594745692|5.0|These cards, while I agree with many here, aren't exactly what you would use for readings.  They are more of a novelty in my opinion.  The artwork is really nice.  I wasn't going to use them to do readings and I didn't want them sitting around in a box where nobody could see them so I decided to frame them and hang them up in our guy room.  They look great!  I have uploaded a picture of them hanging on the wall along with some other cards I have framed.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I like the love story underneath it all. This series really keeps you engrossed. I couldn't put it down until I got to the end.
B003SI05PG|1.0|Two hours of my life I'll never get back. We attempted to watch this twice and finally made it to the end on the third attempt. Boring. Pointless. And WAY overrated. Tim Burton is a genius, so we'll give him a pass on this high school project, which probably earned him a &#34;C.&#34;
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Love this game, great graphics, fun upgrade system, easy to play anytime even if you only have a few minutes!
B005PK57IK|4.0|I have watched it from the beginning and have recently gone back to see previous episodes. They don't get old, they get get better with age.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|At first, I thought it would.be a math kind of he but it is so not!<br />The first levels are easy but they get much harder.<br />Flow Free really gets you thinking in a fun way that doesn't even feel like thinking!<br />Nice work, Big Duck Games!<br />Get this app!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />:)
B005544TRQ|5.0|We can't wait to get to the next episode every time. But Amazon Prime Instant Video has been failing regularly on our Samsung Smart TV.
B007D5E7C2|4.0|Great retro cast, great retro soundtrack, terrific dialog. Am I the only one who wanted to see a Sonny Chiba vs. David Carradine showdown? a majorly missed opportunity. The leader of a gang of ruthless assassins orders them to crash a wedding where his deadliest member will tie the knot and puts her into a coma. Out of the coma, Tarantino makes sure the bride takes you on the most interesting trips of revenge ever taken in movies. Sonny Chiba proves he is a very good actor and can be funny. David Carradine rises to the occasion as Bill to give one of his best performances. Michael Madsen is good as usual in a minor role. Uma Thurman and Lucy Liu use their star power to get the mainstream fans into the theaters who don't know who the rest of the cast is. For some reason Gordon Liu gets to play two people and has a larger role than the intense and charismatic Sonny Chiba. Michael Parks as sherrif perfects his southern drawl and shows up again in Pt. 2 unrecognizable and with a Spanish accent in two well done cameos. Uma tries hard but Cameron Diaz would probably have been better judging from her intense action in Charlie's angels. 16x9 video and audio on the dvd is very good and bluray-better. Extras are interviews, trailers, commentary etc.
B00G6S8P5C|4.0|Not bad for an entry level inexpensive dj start up application..As a former dj from the 80`s and 90`s It doesn't give you the real hands on control like tables or decks but for mixing on the go and ease of use YOU CANT BEAT IT! Its fun and well worth the money.
B0014ERKO0|4.0|Fun film.  Good to see the crew working together.  Not up to the standards of Continuum, which gets a solid 5 stars, but thoroughly enjoyable.<br />Making it even more so is being a member of Amazon Prime, where I get to watch it for free!
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Interesting plot lines and subject, good acting, comic relief.. Nice show that blends 'there ain't no way that's possible' with 'that might just BE possible'
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This game is. So freaking fun I would s a sacrifice my own child to have that red superman skin lollipop f or Dec scarf birth
B00EPFEY44|3.0|This is not the entire concert.  Only selected portions of it originally aired in PBS.. I researched on line.  The entire concert is available for &#62; $50
B008C20TDG|5.0|It's fun to read and the information sticks in the brain in an almost hypnotic way. I love this book and it has really helped me changed my eating habits and to make healthy choices in an easy effortlessly way.
B003NRWW58|1.0|Despite the fact that I absolutely adore the Dr Who franchise I tried to temper my expectations.  It is a spinoff after all and those rarely live up to their source.  However, instead of a watered down Dr Who as I was expecting I ended up with one of the most god awful television shows in recent memory.  I don't mind the swearing or the violence.  It's quite honestly never really offended me.  I enjoy a number of very graphic shows like Spartacus and Game of Thrones, but in this abomination we're introduced to one of the main protagonists as he uses an alien aphrodisiac in order to rape a woman at the bar. Granted, because of certain events he doesn't follow through with it, but it was definitely not a moral turnaround.  The rest of the crew isn't much better.  Little jealousy fits and love spats between all of them.  It's almost as if they decided to take an idea introduced in the Dr Who franchise and hand it over to a day time soap opera writer and this is the result.  I'm sorry, but I can't bring myself to cheer for characters like this.  there should be some attachment to characters in shows you watch.  If a primary character perishes it should hit you, make you feel something.  There isn't a single character on this show that I would shed a tear over.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is worth the money. Thanks notch!!!! (I have 0.7.6) I like this game<br />I wish minecraft ps3/ps4 came out by now....
B005LN5UOC|2.0|Compared to some regular Bluetooth headsets intended for general use, this 'gaming' headset seems to have taken some steps backward. Its large and hard plastic body fit only a users right ear, and its 'adjustable' ear strap is really just rubbery plastic that holds no shape or memory but always returns to its original shape which is too big for my ear.<br /><br />Although it paired with my ps3 as easily as my Motorola Bluetooth headset everything else about this clunky, inexpensive feeling design paled to a similarly priced headset purchased for a cell phone.<br /><br />Also the buttons on the headset are poorly designed. Although the one large button is easy to find while this headset is being worn, the pressure required to press it and the ear-splittingly loud click sound of the button makes will likely have you taking off this device to use any of the buttons rather than hurting your ear.<br /><br />The sound is OK but with all the other problems I still prefer my Motorola headset.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|John Scalzi writes hardcore sci fi with aliens, modified humans, and space war. His tone and pacing remind me of my favorite author, Robert Heinlein. I enjoyed the entire Old Mans War series. I always recommend them to sci fi newbies. I also read everything I can find of Scalzi. Great author of our time!
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|It's a fun game that requires some planning.  Although I haven't felt the urge to replay the boards after completing them.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|This was a fun app that allowed me play songs that I need help with. I also earned a couple new fun songs.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is the first book I have read by the author. It is a psychological thriller. It is also suspenseful. I like the characters including the infamous Colonel Graff. Now I will go and see the movie.
B00FU3DS24|5.0|First of all, I honestly can't believe NO ONE has reviewed this album. Well, let me start by saying that if you're into '70s Hard Rock or Metal AT ALL then you owe it to yourself to have this masterpiece in your collection. From the amazing Roger Dean gatefold cover to the opening of the first track, &#34;Sunrise&#34;, you know you're beginning a very special journey, and you're right, you are. There is not one minute of filler on this album. If you like your music to full tilt ROCK without stopping, look elsewhere. But if you like variations in tempo and mood on an album, you'll feel right at home here.This album is part of what is known as the &#34;classic&#34; Uriah Heep lineup: Mick Box: guitar, David Byron: vocals, Ken Hensley: keyboards, guitar, vocals, Gary Thain: bass, and Lee Kerslake: drums, vocals. Of the five albums from this period of Uriah Heep, &#34;The Magician's Birthday&#34; shines like a beacon over the rest, with only &#34;Demons and Wizards&#34; and &#34;Wonderworld&#34; coming even close to its shadow. This album is magical. There are certain records that completely command your undivided attention the moment the needle is dropped, and this is one of them. Just so we're on the same page, I'll name a few others. Pink Floyd's &#34;Dark side of the Moon&#34;, Yes' &#34;Close to the Edge&#34;, The Rolling Stones' &#34;Their Satanic Magesties Request&#34;, and The Beatles' &#34;Sgt. Pepper...&#34; I stayed within the same generation for those examples, so for the younger folks, let's say Porcupine Tree's &#34;The Sky Moves Sideways&#34;, Opeth's &#34;Morningrise&#34;, Queensryche's &#34;Operation: Mindcrime&#34;, or Iron Maiden's &#34;Powerslave&#34;. This is right up there with any of those. If you turn off the lights and let yourself go, this album will make you feel like you're sitting in the middle of a dark, dense forest under a full moon. Who needs drugs when there's music this amazing?
0399161287|5.0|Amazing book, among the best books I read so far. Beyond learning about the boxing and \\"the baddest man on the planet\\", the life of Tyson is complex. This book is as good if not better than a lot of psychology books out there,the environment of the young Tyson, then being destroyed and rebuilt by Cus D'amato to be Iron Mike, remind me of Joseph Campbell story of The Hero with a thousand face and the power of the myth, Tyson became a myth..... the mindset of a champion, the training, the focus, the doubt ,the glory....the failure ....How do one who never had anything handle Celebrity Status, we are quick to judge without understanding people....
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Like his very first book, Grisham has a big hit with this one. He has a real grasp on racial matters. I couldn't put this one down.
