B000002UUX|5.0|One of the best metal albums of all time, Megadeth hit their peak on this album. The opening song \\"Holy Wars\\" is filled with classic thrash metal riffage, followed by the great solo work of \\"Hangar 18\\". It'd be hard to maintain the brilliance of the first two songs, but the next seven do a fairly good job, with great thrash songs like \\"Five Magics\\" and \\"Tornado of Souls,\\" and a couple off-color songs like \\"Poison Was the Cure\\". The only less than stellar song on the album, IMO, is Dawn Patrol, though even that isn't bad. The music here isn't the fastest, or the heaviest, or even the most technically amazing (though Mustaine certainly is a riff-master), but it's definitely among the best music the metal genre has ever offered. It's been 17 years since this album debuted, and it's just as enjoyable today as it was when it was first released.
B000QFAJ7S|4.0|if you are a kelly clarkson fan then you have to get this cd. i love haunted. i can understand every word in that song. how i feel, that song just rocks. never again is a hit.don't waste your time should be a single.one minute is a good song. i say get the cd it will grow on you.
B000P0J024|5.0|The guys sound great: what else can I add to the other reviews? There is so much good-natured testosterone infused fun in this collection. I'd forgotten what a cleverly hilarious song \\"Dirty World\\" is, and I can't help but smile every time I hear \\"Handle With Care\\" because I can hear the smile in George's voice! But now, with this reissue, Volume One is even better with the addition of the Latin-flavored, bright guitar-driven \\"Maxine.\\"  I wonder why they didn't put that song on Volume Three when it was originally released, in place of one of the Dylan-centric songs? In my humble opinion, Volume Three suffered just a tad not only from the absence of Roy Orbison, but from too much Dylan. Brilliant lyricist as the man is, too much of his voice gets on my nerves. Part of the magic of the first album was how all of these very unique and stylistically different musicians blended. I felt this blend was missing from the second album.  But \\"She's My Baby\\" and \\"The Wilbury Twist\\" make up for my nit-picky little complaint.  I adore George Harrison, so it's natural that I would love the DVD, but my oldest son was cracking up right along with me (Tom Petty and George were especially witty) so I'm not just being a starry-eyed fan.<br />Love those Wilburys!
B000RJO58M|5.0|A hilarious buddy-cop film with Britain's best buds, Pegg and Frost. Set in a perfect sleepy country town, the action and edge to the film couldn't be more surprising.  Hilarious-and-yet-sinister locals, straightman cop, you have to laugh out loud at the interaction.  If you liked \\"Shaun of the Dead,\\" you will love this latest feature by quite a creative team.
0143038419|5.0|As a guy, my mind simply would've never noticed this book in order for me to pick it up. The title and presentation, with exception to the prayer beads, simply don't call out to the masculine spirit. It took one of my beautiful friends of the feminine persuasion to place this book in my hands.<br /><br />As a hitchhiker thru many lands, my wanderlust delighted and splashed in the puddles of scenic descriptions and friendly faces that fill this book. Many memories resurfaced, particularly in India, and future plans were altered to take in a bit of the author's own experiences.<br /><br />As a holyman, I love watching myself and others be dragged (kicking and screaming) by our divine guidance to a more healthy, holy self. From the very introduction, I could feel the presence of the divine that had already entered this woman, and so dug in for a good read that rarely let me down.<br /><br />As a lover, who was once under a vow of celibacy, I could empathize with Elizabeth's pain in a place where passion and sex ruled, but know well the internal fortitude and strength this builds. The internal strife of this choice was one of my favorite aspects of her growth.<br /><br />As an Austinite, the author's Austinite friend met in India--Richard from Texas (Austin, nonetheless)--assures me that the story I'm reading has been told strikingly close to the truth. His words, demeanor and form of hardened spirituality screams of Austin, Texas, which is my favorite port of call in all the world.<br /><br />As a writer, had I only one sentence in which to sum up this book, I would state: \\"One woman's journey, out of breakdown back to wholeness, across Italy, India and Indonesia.\\" Amazingly, this just happens to be a good part of what the title states, and it's obvious from the very start that her journey was more success than failure.<br /><br />As a walking advertising campaign for everything I love, I have found that I can turn anyone onto this book simply by handing it to them with the words: \\"Pick a paragraph... any paragraph.\\" I've yet to have anyone simply shrug off what they read at random.<br /><br />To Elizabeth Gilbert: \\"My love and gratitude for every word. See you later alligator.\\"\\" I've yet to have anyone simply shrug off what they read at random.    To Elizabeth Gilbert: \\"My love and gratitude for every word. See you later alligator.\\"
B000I5YCCO|4.0|If I was 15 I would give this cd 5 stars hands down.  Taylor has a great voice, catchy lyrics, and a nice combination of slow and fast songs.  However, I feel a bit sheepish jammin' to it in my car when the lyrics are so clearly written by a 15 year old--not saying that they are bad (they are quite catchy) but they so obviously explain the life of a fifteen year old and not an adult.  Still, I really really think this CD is worth the money, you may just feel a little silly when you sing along with a few songs ... \\"I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive, your a redneck heartbreak whose really bad at lying. So watch me light a match on all my wasted time as far I'm concerned your just another picture to burn.\\"
B000OZ2CZW|4.0|Rihanna was one of those artists that created killer singles, but terrible albums. \\"Music of the Sun\\" and \\"A Girl Like Me\\" created some of the greatest summer singles of the 21st century, but the albums as a whole failed to impress. They were mediocre at best. But on this stunning album, Rihanna finally created what she has been trying to do for the past three years. She finally made an album where almost all the tracks are good! The song with Ne-Yo and the track, \\"Say It\\" could be replaced with the bonus tracks, \\"Cry\\" and \\"Haunted\\", but otherwise the album is great! Another problem is that the album isn't the standard size of a regular jewel case. So it will not fit in a CD rack. But overall, a really club-ready album that could get me on the dancefloor from start to finish.
B000FZETKC|4.0|This is a well-acted film about young love and all its ups and downs. The three main characters are excellent in their roles, and there's a good supporting cast. If you want a happy ending, you'll get it with this movie!
B000QFAJ7S|4.0|I never really used to like Kelly Clarkson. Every song on her sophomore album, \\"Breakaway\\", became singles and I got totally sick of them. And I also thought she wasn't creating the right type of music for her vocal style. And with, \\"My December\\", she is making the right type of music! When I heard the first single, \\"Never Again\\", I was like HELL YEAH! This is it! She has finally done it! The rest of the album did not let me down either! \\"One Minute\\", \\"Sober\\", \\"Haunted\\", and \\"Irvine\\" are amazing songs and some of the best of her career! Great job Kelly! Continue on this path and you will have a new fan in me!
B000NIVJHM|5.0|This is such a classic! Who doesn't love this movie?! I've watched it many times. Great love story, wonderful dancing, and excellent cast!
B0009FU0ZQ|4.0|This movie is well done and has a good story.  IF you like the Spenser series and others by this author, you will enjoy the mystery plot.  Tom Selleck has enhanced a good story, and plays the part of Sheriff Stone as one would imagine in reading the story.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|As a Kelly Fan from day 1, this is her most captivating album yet. If you like the direction she is taking you will love this album. Each song is motivating and catchy. Yes fans it was her turn to do her thing. Clive has to remember, she won 2 Grammys already. Once an artist recieves a Grammy, they should be able to do as they wish.    I will break down each song's meaning:    1. Never Again- compelling and catchy. She reveals her thoughts on a prior relationship.    2. One Minute- Life is never surprising unless you know what you want.    3. Hole- You have to get out of the situation you are in.    4. Sober-Her most personal yet, enables you to think you can go on when there is nothing else there to show you.    5. Don't Waste Your Time-Self explanatory haha!    6. Judas- Why did you betray me?    7. Haunted-You want the one you want by your side.    8. Be Still-Take a chance!    9. Maybe-You can overcome your flaws and expectations.    10. How I Feel-Overcoming one's feelings.    11. Yeah-Most catchy, give me that sexy smile!    12. Can I Have a Kiss?-A lighter song, showing you truly want someone.    13. Irvine/Chivas- Praying for someone to help (Irvine) Chivas (Hidden Track)-Greatest song ever! Tell that ex special someone to go away and enjoy their new toy.    Simple overall-Anti-Love Album-Great for us guys or girls unlucky in love! Kelly is truly the one to litsen too!    In addition if you purchase this on I-Tunes You get 4 unreleased songs:    14. Dirty Little Secret (Not All-Am. Rejects)  2 Versions of Never Again remixes  15. Not Today    If you liked Breakaway and Thankful-purchase this! Evolution of Kelly Clarkson has begun!    10/10!!!!
B0000542D2|5.0|I absolutely love this movie!  I wasn't sure that I was going to like it before I had watched the movie. (I thought that it was going to be just another boring black and white movie.)   The cover does not do the movie any justice. . . But I was hooked from the very beginning: The song \\"A Hard Days Night\\" started playing, and one of the Beatles members tripped running from a crowd of obsessed fans. From that point on, I laughed the entire time it was playing.  Watching it was the reason that I fell in love with the Beatles in the first place.  John, Paul, George and Ringo are such witty individuals, and I think that every person should see this movie . . . . at least twice!!  I don't consider myself to be a movie critic by any means, so as far as acting abilities, plot, ect. are concerned, I would not be the best person to give a review of that nature.   But I do know a good movie when I see one, and this is definitely one of them. . . .

B000O174CM|5.0|I have watched this movie 6 times, and never get tired or bored with it.  The music/score is great, Jennifer Hudson shines, as does Beyonce and Eddie Murphy.  This is one of my favorite films ever.
B0001XAOLQ|4.0|The full-length \\"uncut\\" version ties together a lot of loose ends that  were present in the shorter versions. In the shortened versions, it was  never clear why the U-96 was ordered to make the extremely dangerous run  through the straits of Gibralter or why U-96 was reprovisioned in the  Spanish port of Vigo. The uncut version provides an answer to that. It also  adds a bit of suspense because it becomes evident in the uncut version that  u-boat operations may have been penetrated by British Intelligence and Admiral Dönitz was taking measures in an attemp to throw the British off  their scent. The Germans were indeed trying to get some u-boats into the  Mediterranean to help secure Rommel's supply lines. This version also gives greater depth to the relationship between the captain and his crew  and their determined loyalty to him. Individual characters are seen much  more fully developed, this seemed especially true for radioman/sonar operator/medic Hinrich and the extraordinary care he rendered to the badly  injured Kriechbaum after U-96 was strafed by a British fighter in the  straits. This version does take some liberties with the english   sub-titles compared to the German dialogue, in many instances the \\"translation\\" does not fit at all, as a german speaker I did find that  a bit annoying but overall it doesn't detract that much from this version.  If you like submarine movies and \\"Das Boot\\" in particular, the \\"uncut\\"  version is highly recomended.
1881273156|4.0|My husband and I got this book in the first few months of our marriage and read it together over the passage of a couple weeks. There were a few parts where we ended up laughing because they are a bit cheesy but over all it really added insite to the whys and hows of realtionship health. We figured out that even though we get along great, we have different ways of showing love and different ways of appreciating love. Over all, it's an eye opening book.

B000P2A256|4.0|this album really grew on me, but not as wacky and good as the first one. i still love maroon 5 though!
B000QFAJ7S|4.0|If any word would be used to describe this album i think the perfect word would be RAW. This album is not your typical stereo-type pop/rock female record.  This record i feel is full of raw emotion which came from kelly herself. Eventhough some of the songs are not as radio friendly as some younger kelly fans may like i think that with such ballads as \\"Sober\\" any person would like this record. Also the hidden track \\"Chivas\\" is a  nice surprise and another great song that just adds to the other amazing songs on the album. This record has songs like \\"never again\\" and \\"yeah\\" that you can rock out too as well as the amazing showcasing of kelly's great vocals. Overall, i love this record and i think people who weren't kelly fans will become one after they listen to My December.

B00005JPQT|3.0|LF or DH is a nice bookend to the series.  john is sought to bring in a computer ace hacker because it seems other \\"famous\\" hackers are being killed off-also, the goverment system has been compromised.  so, the bad guy is deliciously played by DEADWOODS-TIMMY OLYPHANT.  he has the meaness, swagger and confindence to wreck the system since he made it.  he was screwed over and now he is going to shut america down.  interesting premise, excellent over the top special effects and performances.  john's daughter is along for the ride and has several great key scenes.  justin long is the ace hacker who helps \\"outdated\\" john mcclane understand the techie world.  great action and enough entertainment to satisfy the viewer.  if you liked the series then sit right down for a familiar friend-doing his job.
159562015X|2.0|I bought this product at the suggestion of a counselor and found that it was somewhat insightful.  It confirmed what I suspected about myself (...after perusing the themes previously...).<br /><br />How much can one read into this type of examination?  Not sure...but I will say that a recent job inquiry provoked a very similar online examination through an independent agency.  This type of book + examination might be the next thing in HR.
0375831002|4.0|I chose this book as a selection on the summer reading list I gave to my Sophomore English students, and their response to it has been very positive.  I thought it was a bit slow at the beginning, but by the middle of the book, I was hooked.  The main character is very likable, and, by the end of the book, I even ended up liking her foster mother who is thoroughly unpleasant in the beginning.  There is a bit of bad language (espcially from the foster mother), but it is mild.  The story of the main character's journey more than makes up for that.  I wouldn't really call this a children's book (although I know it received children's awards) just because of the contenet (war, death, etc) and the complex emotional issues.  The reading level ranges from high 6th or 7th grade and up.
B00005RIKI|5.0|This is my favorite Lynyrd Skynyrd.  I've had the album, 8 track, cassette and now the CD.  Would definitely purchase it again if something replaced the CD![[ASIN:B00005RIKI Pronounced Leh-Nerd Skin-Nerd]]

B00005JNJV|1.0|Apparently, the only path to wisdom and a life packed with acts of kindness is arse freezing and sword and/or kickboxing tricks.   Ridiculous movie designed for brainless pimpled teenagers.  Nauseating philosophy wrapping grandiloquent dialogues.    At least the Rambo suite was honest entertainment.
0374530718|4.0|Philosophy is the love of knowledge: but more than that it is about using your imagination; about stretching the limits of your understanding and deciding what is real and what is not. Sophie's World is a good introduction to Philosophy and gives some idea of the mystery which surrounds what is and what is not whilst at the same time giving an overview of different Philosophical thought throughout the ages. It reminded me somewhat of Alice in Wonderland. I thought it was a good read and understandably it is a best seller.
1594489505|4.0|What I liked about the book:    1.  I liked the clear and concise writing style.  It lets you flip through the pages, even though the pages are filled with great emotion.  Yes, sadness fills these well-written pages.  But it's all worth it.  It's inspirational to see the strength of these two Afghan women.      2.  The setting is more than intriguing.  It spans from the era of the 1970's Afghan King, to the tumultuous Soviet invasion, to the fabled and fundamentalist Taliban.    3.  The love that Mariam and Laila show for each other.  You might expect the two wives of a polygamous husband to be adversaries and compete for Rasheed's love and affection.  But instead, they endure the terrible marriage together.  These interactions are great.    4.  I like reading a book about Afghanistan.  It is nice to have a different perspective of this land, not to see it as a simple media-conjured stereotype.      5.  It is a love story that even lovers of action and adventure can enjoy.    6.  The second half of the book.  I'm not saying the first half is bad, but it is always a treat to read a book that gets better with each page.    7.  The unexpected climax at the end.  Do you like books with a twist?  The book wanders away from its path for a surprising ending.    Plot Summary:    It is a well-written tale of two Afghan women trapped in a polygamous marriage with a tyrannical man named Rasheed.  The setting is more than intriguing.  It spans from the era of the 1970's Afghan King, to the tumultuous Soviet invasion, to the fabled and fundamentalist Taliban.  But it is not a historical account of different Afghan regimes.  No, it is the tale of this terrible marriage. It is more than a tale of marriage though, it is a love story that ever lovers of action and adventure can love.      The love is actually between these two women, Mariam and Laila.  They were both thrust into this marriage, with little say in the matter, and ended up being the perpetual victims of violence and abuse.  Rather than becoming adversaries, the co-wives become great friends and endure the tortuous marriage together.    The book is about the interaction between the two women and their family members.  It is refreshing to read a book about these simple interactions that are not epic in proportion, but bring true importance to the family members.    You really feel bad for Mariam.  She was forced into marrying a man 25 years older than her when she was just 15!  Her husband, Rasheed, mistreats her when she isn't able to give birth to a child and he even marries a second wife.  Suprisingly, Mariam and this second wife, Laila, become great friends and together endure the brutality of this terrible man.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I have to apologize for being a little late to the Corinne Bailey Rae party.  Forgive me, music fans!  It's not like I didn't know who she was from hearing Put Your Records On and Like a Star in the last year or so.  When I saw the album in stores last summer, I was intrigued in getting it from reading the critics fantastic quotes about her on the cover's sticker.  However, I kept denying myself and it led up til this past March or early April.  Then I was just flicking through channels when I turned to one that had her performing a live concert in New York so I decided to tune in to see what she had.  That was the turning point cause I was overwhelmed by her and completely impressed!  So much that I went out and bought the self-titled album within the next day or so.  But for whatever reason, I decided to hold off on opening the CD right away.  Look up and it's basically summmer before opening it up.  I hear the track Trouble Sleeping late one night on BET J, I knew I couldn't wait anymore to hear this music.  Some months after buying it, one summer day, 46 minutes and 11 tracks of listening and I was sucked into it and her deep.  We have a jewel of an artist and a jewel of an album on our hands!    Enriched and dipped into the soul and blues pot, this CD is a pure joy!  And being that she wrote pretty much all of it and plays instruments for her songs, mainly the guitar, also just adds to the vibe.  Kind of a female equivalent to John Legend and his piano. (It's sort of a great cover as well with her as the centerpiece but her guitar in it as it is the co-star.)  The music just puts you in that great summer mood that are greatly linked to vivid summer moments and memories.  Some memories that were simple and were everyday like ths sun shining so bright that you knew it was going to be one of those beautiful days, being with your friends and family having fun and/or listening to the radio chillin' outside.  Some more than simple like summer block parties or summerbirthdays or even summer loves.  But all adding up to some great summers in our lives.  This totally has that feel to it as you may start to reminisce on past standout summers.     Her songs talk of raw emotions of love, even though you may also get the feelings like I explained above.  Most of her emotions speak of the light-hearted side of it while a couple are a bit more sorrowful.  But all so pure and heartfelt! And her soft, whispery at times voice can make you melt and feel so comfortable.  She can use that voice to talk about being in love with someone so much that she's under the spell of them in \\"Enchantment\\" then fight the thought of being in love with someone so much that she's losing sleep over it in which is probably my favorite song right now in \\"Trouble Sleeping\\".  And can also talk of having strong feelings that maybe love with a boy best friend but the uncertainty of going/crossing over that line with them, the other person's feelings towards her and knowing that it can totally change things holding it back with the track \\"Breathless.\\"  So many different emotions and feelings that all just lead to one thing, great music!  A couple of tracks that just pull me are Call Me When You Get This, Put Your Records On, I'd Like To and Seasons Change.  Trouble Sleeping like i said takes the cake right now for me!  It's just spiced up with the right blend of trumpets and horns and has the right feel with the background vocals.  Even though it's one of the shorter tracks and maybe not as long in the lyric department as others, it just grabs a hold of me and does not let me go.  I love it that much!  Also tracks to look out for and not have under your radar are Choux Pastry Heart and the last two tracks, Butterfly and Seasons Change.    How could I deny myself so long?  I may never know.  But glad it came at the right time with summer swinging in cause it fits so perfectly with this season even though it would excel anytime of the year.  This has to be one of thebest CDS musically I have bought in the last few years!  It really stands that high up there!  Corinne Bailey Rae is sort of look a drug in a good way.  Once you get a taste, you may never want to go back to what you had before.  Between her and Chrisette Michele, I have gotten a double dose in the last week and have listen to both albums like everyday.  I really can't go without them right now for fear of withdrawal symptoms.  Do yourself a favor and get hooked!
B000OCXMAE|5.0|Now I'm sure there are plenty of people who didn't like the new album as much as the previous ones. Personally I think that half the songs were really good, and the other half was soso. It's rare that I like every song on an album and Linkin Park has always been able to get at least half of their songs on an album to be appreciated by my friends as well as myself. I think if anything, many of the endings in songs are over done in the album but that's about it.
B000OYC3J8|5.0|I sit with a somber heart today, listening to the new White Stripes album on the same day that fashion legend Liz Claiborne started designing garments for all the women of heaven. Liz incorporated white stripes in some of the clothing she designed. The White Stripes were everything that Liz Claiborned liked. They wear neat clothes, are creative and from all accounts, don't smell that bad. This album is the album I find most aligned with the fashion world. There is harder drumming on this one and nothing drums harder than a catwalk in Paris in the springtime. Earlier white stripes albums were more focused on things like Wichita, but Icky Thump screams \\"Fashion!!!\\". My mom had a liz claiborne handbag back in 1987. She would complain all of the time about the transition in music from keyboard driven garbage like Human League to Hair metal. She was hoping for a brother sister team made up of just a guitar and and drums to come along and save rock. Well, guess what happened. My mom is probably carrying her Liz Claiborne handbag singing Icky Thump to the heavens today. Liz Claiborne never met average and neither has my mom since she helped make me.

B000P2A24W|5.0|I've heard some great country albums in my life, but this thing ranks at #2 behind any Tanya Tucker album with \\"Two Sparrows in a Hurricane\\" on it. That song makes me tear up and get all sad. What amazes me on this CD is Bon Jovi's ability to write their own material, yet sound exactly like all of the manufactured music produced by country artists. It is a big step forward to go from \\"New Jersey\\" and \\"Slippery when wet\\" to work with musical royalty like Big and Rich. I wish they would have thrown a couple interludes in there with Bill Engvall spewing out some side splitting comedy as only Bill Engvall can. This transformation has been coming for years because most kids grow up rock fans in New Jersey only to hope to cut a country album several years later. They should have done Two Sparrows because it would have made this the greatest country album ever. I'm now at a crossroads though with Bon Jovi. When they tour, do I show up to the show in the rock gear driving the muscle car or do I tear off the sleeves, throw on a John Deere hat and jack my pickup 23 feet off the ground? I'm very simple by nature, so these kind of things confuse me.    I'm so happy Bon Jovi joined the new country movement. The music is very complicated and sophisticated. I hadn't formed a Bon Jovi cover band because I found the high notes in \\"livin on a prayer\\" hard to hit, but give me some new country and it's on like Ms. Pac Man. I think they should do an entire album of George Jones covers next. Bravo to Bon Jovi for taking the avenue that will sell some of your albums again. Bon Jovi is now running neck and neck with average.
038533348X|3.0|I guess it's considered a modern classic by some, but it seemed kind of lazily written to me.  Full of intriguing ideas and well-drawn characters, the book starts out strong enough. Once the action reaches San Lorenzo and begins to build toward its apocalyptic climax, however, it gradually becomes less and less coherent.  While the story ends with the ultimate bang, it sort of whimpers its way there -- Maybe it's some sort of literary device that I just didn't get -- And is it just me, or does Vonnegut's slightly self-righteous cynicism, doubtless refreshing in the early 1960's when the book was published, now seem just a little tired?  The Vonnegut true believers would probably call this so much \\"foma,\\" but, in my opinion, if you're looking for one of the Great Man's books to read, stick with [[ASIN:0385333846 Slaughterhouse-Five]]
B000NQR7NO|4.0|Arctic monkeys exploded on the during December 2005, when their first single climbed to the top of the English charts, thanks in no small part to their cult following that the Sheffield lads developed via their my space page.     Now little over a year after their debut effort, are defiantly in the difficult second album territory with \\"Favourite Worst Nightmare\\"     The album gets off to a blistering start with the guitars blasting the listeners ear drums, and what a cracking start to the album, and even though it was released as the albums first single, its not an obvious choice as a single, which is what makes this such an inspired choice for a lead single.     The album shows that since the first record that they have both become more competent as musicians, Alex has become a sharper songwriter, more confident as a performer, this has been in no small part to the fact that their debut was the fastest selling albums of all time.    On first listen it sounds like the album shows no sign of progression, but on further inspection this is not the case, there is a stronger sense of funk, there is a dark feel to the lyrics.     The Arctic's even mange to mellow their sound out a bit, in the shape of only ones that know, which, is by far the weakest song on the album, and it really ought to have been left off the album proper, they should have included the song \\"Temptation Greats You Like A Naughty Friend\\", which was a b-side.     That is the only weak link, in what is other a very strong chain, this is quick and fast, and in releasing so quickly after its debut, it didn't allow for the lads to become to self indulgent, and this is a definite contender for album of the year, that is for sure.
B000EXZI0A|4.0|OK, so most of the Ramones' songs are a lot alike and sound like they were recorded in somebody's garage (hence 4 stars instead of 5), their infectious energy makes them unforgettable.  They detonated like a bomb amid the slick disco and overproduced pop music scene of the 1970's.  Their music was profoundly influential, but more importantly it was fun ... And it still is, long after Sheena traded in her spiked hair and leather jacket for a mini-van and house in the suburbs.  This CD is a great introduction for a musical dilettante like me.  Although I'm sure the true Ramones' fans will complain that this song or that has been left off, for those of us among the great unwashed, it delivers the goods.  So hey-ho let's go!

1416524800|5.0|Well, I've just put this book down, and I must say \\"I'ts been tense here for two days!\\"<br /><br />Dan Brown, simply put, is one of the most amazing \\"nail biter\\", \\"suspense builder\\", and \\"unbelieveable believeable\\" writers to come along in a very long time! Man, can this guy get \\"into you\\" with the written word!<br /><br />As with many others, I started reading Dan Brown with the \\"Da Vinci Code\\", and then progressed to \\"Angels and Demons\\". Then, I sort of drifted back into my other areas of interest (biogrqaphies and historical).<br /><br />A friend was talking with me about suspense books a few weeks ago, and she mentioned this book, and simply told me \\"This geologist is traveling across the Arctic with his dog sled, when a twin-prop transport helicopter flies over, lands, and two armed men run out and hand him a card with a distress message written on it. They force him to take out his radio, and on an unusual broadcast band, force him at gunpoint to make a distress call, and then they force him to enter the cargo bay of the helicopter with his sled. After becomming airborne again, and at high altitude, they open the back of the machine and they push his dogs and sled out. When he turns to protest, they throw him out, also.....and that's all I'm going to tell you, except from there it just gets better and better with every page, building to a hell-bound climax!\\"<br /><br />Well, she was right. This book is awesome, mixing scientific material and procedural stuff with unimagineable tension, intrigue, blackmail, dirty politics, murder, coercion, deceit.....what a mix! I was unable to put this book down, as in the case of \\"Angels\\" and \\"Da Vinci\\"......<br />A truly awesome string of books this man has created! I can only say that I hope he keeps it up; there is NOTHING like a great suspense mystery.<br /><br />If you have not read this exciting book yet, by all means, do yourself a very great favor, and pick up a copy, and start reading. I positively guarantee that by page 3 you will be hooked, and on your way to one of the most exciting reads you have ever had. Enjoy, as I did!  ~operabruinto one of the most exciting reads you have ever had. Enjoy, as I did!  ~operabruin

0143036238|5.0|I was a little nervous when I first decided to put this on my summer reading list. The book was 367 pages of text, close together, justified and not written in easy language (i.e. modern English). I was optimistically hoping to finish it within a month.<br />But I really liked the movie with Keira Knightley and wanted to see how closely it compared and if it was as good as the movie.<br />Two weeks later, I am done, and I am pleased with the ride.<br /><br />Plot:<br />Mr. Bingley, an eligible, wealthy bachelor, moves nearby the Bennett family, who have five unmarried daughters. The Bennett family must secure good marriages for their daughters since they will inherit nothing when their father dies.  Romance is in the air between Jane Bennett and Mr. Bingley, while the first sparks of love appear between the proud, wealthy Mr. Darcy and the exuberant, Elizabeth Bennett.<br /><br />Good:<br />There are so many good parts to this book!  I don't quite know where to begin!<br />The characters are believable and real.  Elizabeth is a well rounded character.  She starts out proud and prejudiced against Mr. Darcy but as she learns of his true quality is not afraid of changing her mind.  Mr. Darcy was sweet, opinionated, and equally prejudiced against Elizabeth's \\"poor connections\\".<br />The plot was wonderful and well paced.  It kept me on the edge of my seat (although it was not an action book); I couldn't wait to see what would happen on each page.<br />I enjoyed the arguments between Elizabeth (and her fiesty personality) and Mr. Darcy (stiff and proud). The quips they came up with!  The chemistry between the two was perfect!<br />Lastly, I enjoyed how the author emphasized (via Mr. Bennett) to marry for love and not for money or connections or the like.  This is something very much beyond her time (as many marriages in the late 18th century were arranged).<br /><br />Bad:<br />Well, this is being exceedingly petty, but the language of this book makes it difficult for a modern reader to fully understand the nuances of what Jane Austen is trying to say (the notes at the appendix help with this, however).<br /><br />Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence<br />None. Talk is made of how Lydia and an officer run off to live with each other without marrying. None.<br /><br />Overall:<br />Sweet. There is no better word for the free-spirited, witty romance between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. I would have to say this is the best, purest romance story I have ever read (besides, maybe [[ASIN:0345348036 The Princess Bride]]). The movie does a fabulous job with the book, but the book is even more enjoyable than the movie (if you can imagine).

B000OVLBEO|4.0|And yes, I am a fan of the Ghost Rider. I have every comic from Number 1 because I love the premise. \\"The Spirit Of Vengeance\\" on earth. Cool!<br /><br />I watched this film with my 17 yr old son, who is my reality check when it comes to comics movies. We loved this film! The only problem we had was with the end when Blaze decides to \\"keep\\" his powers. When was he given a choice?<br /><br />Apart from that, this was a great action, comic book movie which didn't deviate from it's origins enough for me to blast it to smithereens. It was cool.<br /><br />And Eva Mendez really is Hot!!<br /><br />Check your brain at the door. This is escapist fantasy fun for the adolescent in all of us.

B000H0MKGK|5.0|Just a few moments ago, I happened to stumble upon the review I had written for \\"Heavier Things\\", which, up until now, was my favorite Mayer project. At the age of 16, I wrote a sort of laughable review - I discussed how I thought that the \\"country twang\\" in \\"Come Back to Bed\\" was an experiment gone awry. How foolish I must have been. But now, at my mature age of twenty, I must say that John Mayer has got it going on. Many of my friends laughed at me when I practically ran out to buy this album - but to me, Mayer is a way of life. I never miss a concert of his when he comes close to whichever city I am living in at that moment, whether I catch him at Red Rocks or Webster Hall in NYC, yet there is no simple way of explaining my love for his music.    Perhaps John himself explained to all the skeptics, all the non-believers, why Mayer is such a godsend, a breath of fresh guitarist air. First and foremost, I feel that John Mayer is by trade a highly-talented guitarist, and not at all like the gooey, self-depreciating character that he plays in most of his songs. He is still underrated by most in this area, and I feel that seeing him live is the only remedy to this curse.    That being said, I feel obligated to tell you that \\"Continuum\\" is the best album to be released in the past year. (Sorry, Justin.) It ranges from sweet acoustic tales of life and love (\\"The Heart of Life\\"), to full-out emotive, electrically-enhanced ballads (\\"Slow Dancing in A Burning Room\\"), to upbeat, percussion-happy messages of hope (Waiting On the World to Change\\"). A few of these songs were performed by his John Mayer Trio way back in 2005 (Another show I did happen to catch.) Most notably, and most exciting, in my opinion, Mayer covers Hendrix's \\"Bold As Love\\". Of course it is done as an homage to Hendrix, but it leaves us wondering whether John Mayer is our generation's version of a Jimi Hendrix. He channels the man himself with his hands, but only time will tell where Mayer will end up ranking in the realm of music legends. So far, with this album, Mayer is sitting pretty.
B000O77RLE|5.0|Being nominated for \\"Best Picture\\" by the Academy Awards (or something like that), this movie definitely deserves 5 stars. Taking the viewpoint of the Japanese Imperial Army during this battle is also a very interesting concept, and doesn't portray American soldiers in the stereotypical \\"super human\\" like they are in pretty much all other war films. The Blu-Ray disk quality is outstanding. Even when played on 480p (not and HD resolution), it appears brighter and fuller than standard DVD when played on a Playstation 3.  If you're a fan of war films, and you have the capability to play Blu-Ray disks, this is definitely a movie for you.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Probably one of the most fun to watch shows I've ever seen, nothing I've ever read in a review has done it justice, Take elements of the civil war, the cowboy era and Han Solo and you might have some clue as to what is in store for you.
0385522401|2.0|I was not impressed by this story and I had a hard time getting through the book.  Too much jumping around about the characters past lives.  I got the issues with the couple's families with the first flashback.  The characters were flat and not likable.  I couldn't root for either one. I guess I hoped the couple would get back together and work through their problems.
B000MXPE7O|2.0|I had high expectations for this film - it was hyped up pretty good, and how could it not be with the all star cast. The imagery in the film was strong and compelling, as was the subject matter. For a contemporary film, I think they did a pretty good job of splicing historical aspects of the US's conflicts over the past 70 years, into a fictional (as far as I know?) film/story.     With that said, the characters were poorly developed, and the film itself lacked any real emotion. I think the best way to describe the flaw in this film is that I was aware I was watching a film - a good film makes you forget you're even watching a film, and you effortlessly empathize with the characters. The poor writing was directly responsible for this. The film was predictable as well - (spoiler warning) - you knew that the brother was going to tell Matt Damon that Angelina Jolie was pregnant was soon as you saw him on the beach - and, you knew that the poetry professor was going to come on to Matt Damon as soon as he said 'I'd like to see you in my office'...The formulaic Hollywood film factory at its best/worst.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|I've been listening to this cd non-stop since I got it.  Kelly's vocals are amazing on this album.

Judas - 4/5 stars - This song has a great beat, and very catchy after a few listens  7. Haunted - 5/5 stars - I love this song!!!  8. Be Still - 5/5 stars - I love how this song is chill and laid back, and very pretty  9. Maybe - 4/5 stars - This song has a good hook.  10.

Dirty Little Secret - 5/5 stars - This song can be bought through Itunes.  I love how bluesy she sounds in this song. Great, Great Song!!!!  16. Not Today - Itunes Exclusive- 4/5 stars - Fun, and very catchy song.  I like it a lot!!!    This CD is so worth the hard work Kelly put into getting it out there for all of us to hear.

Keep it going Scorps... we need more bands like you and messages you try to relay.  I hope I can get to one of your shows again, you are the best!
1419347004|3.0|I love the author and bought this book thinking i would be getting the same 'i cant put this down' type story.  I didnt get into the obsession with shopping and did not think it was as funny.  More or less the character was just too shallow for me.
B00062RCBW|3.0|I love the show very much and consider myself a Trek fan.  It's nice to have the series on DVD, but the extra features are nill if any.  Very sporadic, no real commentary or commentary that is particularly interesting.  If you want your favorite episodes on DVD, you get it. The video quality is not particularly good, it's pretty average.  I think it was a straight transfer from VHS, but I could be wrong.  It would be nice to get director commentaries, but I don't think there are any.  Slightly disappointing considering how much money I blew on the discs, in my opinion.
B000P2A256|2.0|First single \\"Makes Me Wonder\\" is the best song on the album.  \\"Wake up Call\\" and \\"Can't Stop\\" come in a close second with the first one likely to be the next single.  \\"Won't Go Home Without You\\" is there response to \\"She Will Be Loved.\\"  The album isn't quite as clever lyrically, melodically or musically as the first album.  There's no single near as catchy as anything on the first album.  Overall, an okay sophomore attempt that keeps Maroon 5 in the mainstream and gives them one more chance to put out something really great for the next album.  That's my two cents.
B000P0J02E|2.0|This seems to be a spectaculair soundtrack to the populair third movie in the 'pirates' series. It is not. You love this music or you hate it. I don't like it much. It's very predictable, lot of rythems with orchestra and synths. It's Zimmer at random. Some nice moments, but overall, don't bother listen to it if you already have part one or two. In my opinion, Zimmer writes nice melodies, but it's not filmmusic as it should be. You better check out 'Cutthroat Island' by John Debney. 'At worlds end' is a poor attempt to mix modern filmmusic with an old fashion 'swashbuckling' sound. It's time Zimmer gets his retirement.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Bond is back, and Daniel Craig is the man! I remember the furor over Craig's casting as the espionage icon (A blonde Bond? Never!), but I'd seen \\"Layer Cake\\" by that point and I figured that he'd be just fine in the role if the script and the director were right on the money. Looks like everything fell into place, because this was the most exciting Bond film I'd seen in years. It compares favorably to Dr. No and Goldfinger, and in some ways, it's better.
0743270754|5.0|As an educator, I wished that I could give this work by Doris Kearns Goodwin to every student in the school of leadership. Lincoln could have run a clinic for politicians. His rivals could have taken the dubious honor of teaching today's politicians what NOT to do. It was a tremendously enjoyable odyssey through the life and times of Abraham Lincoln. Goodwin has solidly established herself as a most competent biographer of historical figures. This book shows why. It is not as much about Lincoln as much as it is about his rivals, the men who considered themselves more educated, more successful, better known, in short, more likely to lead the nation at this most crucial hour in its history.   It is delilciously intriguing to see this band of haughty, but capable men, one by one, fall under the spell of the man everyone underestimated. Indeed,Goodwin masterfully presents Lincoln's competitors in the way everyone saw them at the time, while accurately portraying Lincoln as that little-known prairie lawyer from Illinois\\".  With his extraordinary ability to empathize with the human plight, and his adamant refusal to hold a political grudge, Lincoln quietly and imperceptibly built his sphere of influence, and put himself in position to wrest the Republican nomination from men, who by most standards, were far more qualified than he. His razor sharp mind, and his iron will, which he seemed to have an uncanny knack for exerting at just the right time, forced even the most arrogant and condescending of politicians, Salmon P. Chase to admit that he had been outfoxed. But with malice toward none, Lincoln offered him and the other rivals a place in his cabinet. No wonder he transcended his time, as Stanton stated, and \\"belongs to the ages\\".  The book is quite voluminous,(over 700 pages), and will take a while to finish, but it is well worth it.
B0000AUHQT|4.0|This movie was lovingly made, and it shows in every gorgeous scene. There are some slow moments, but it's a fine adaptation of one of the greatest novels of all time.

1878424777|2.0|Personally, after listening to almost half, I have come to the conclusion that this stuff is a bunch of......poo.  It rambles endlessly and whatever the author is trying to say is needlessly basted in an unending metaphor.

B000JK8OYU|3.0|I have not seen the show, I bought this CD because I am a Beatles fan. There isn't really anything much new, especially if you have heard the Anthology compilations, which is mostly demos and outtakes, but the sound quality is super on this set. It is so nice to hear these songs cleaned up and polished, brilliant and in stereo (or Dolby 5.1 I think for some)  But for me, once I've heard a little snip of a song so beautifully remastered, it makes me want to hear the entire song, not a few seconds of it before it's in a mash-up with something else. It does kind of grow on you, though. Hopefully some of the later Beatles albums will be remastered one day, can you imagine Sgt Pepper in real stereo instead of vocals on one side and music on the other?
031286504X|5.0|\\"I am Legend\\" is a very human vampire story.  By that I mean that the story revolves around one person, his hopes, fears, loneliness, frustration and despair.  The story takes a new spin on the vampire legend in that it removes the supernatural element of it (though the main character's scientific discoveries) and explains vampirism in terms of a pandemic that wipes out humanity as we know it.  The virus spreads quickly, leading to a breakdown in society and mass death, near total extinction, with the main character as the sole living person as far as we the readers know.  People infected with vampirism quickly die and then come back to life, driven by the need for blood - as with traditional vampire stories.  Rational explanations are given for their aversion to light, garlic, religious relics, and so on.  Even the hunger for blood is explained in biological terms.<br /><br />Early on, you really begin to feel for the main character of the story.  He's a tormented person - by his inner turmoil and the vampires that come out each night in an effort to kill him.  He's left alone, having to watch all that he loves (family) and knows (neighbors, city, and civilization) die and become forever lost.  With this backdrop his character is revealed, both the weaknesses and strengths.  He's a very human character, very round, and very believable.  His loneliness is plain after the loss of his wife and child and all human contact, and he turns to alcohol to sooth his pain.  He becomes desperate for companionship of any sort.  Loss of affection, no outlet for sexuality and companion ship all play a part in this story.  His strength of character and ability to persevere, despite the overwhelming odds, are illustrated throughout the story.<br /><br />It's a very dark story with a dark ending.  It's definitely an intense story.  It's uncluttered with numerous characters and subplots.  It's tightly centered around one very developed character with a fairly unique vampire legend and distinctive storyline.  \\"I am Legend\\" is one of the more human of all horror stories that I've read.storyline.  \\"I am Legend\\" is one of the more human of all horror stories that I've read.

B000002UC5|4.0|\\"McCartney\\", Paul McCartney's first album after the breakup of the Beatles, is a glimpse in time of this talented, enduring musician.  Post-Beatles, pre-Wings, this album is a sort of personal memoir.  McCartney wrote, produced, and performed the entire album in his home studio, before the age of synthesizers and digital effects.  The results are sometimes uneven but sometimes brilliant.  More than thirty-five years later he still gets mileage out of the classic \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" and Phoebe Snow, among others, have made successful covers of \\"Every Night.\\"  As much as anything, though, the album displays McCartney's seemingly endless ability to craft catchy tunes.  \\"McCartney\\" is a pleasant romp through the meandering musical musings of the album's namesake.
1878424114|4.0|Good quick read.Good book to have as a reference book. Deepack takes you very briefly over what he calls Seven Spiritual Laws of Success. The very first step covers the ability to meditate,which is to get in touch with your true self and not your ego-show off self. This i found to be the major step in the book, because without mastering it you can not advance to the next steps. So i found myself highly interested into the meditation subject,all of a sudden.
0743496728|3.0|Jodi Picoult is generally a good storyteller.  She does not let us down in her latest novel, Nineteen Minutes.  This is solid writing and gives the reader one glimpse into the minds and lives of some young folks who wind up on the cutting room floor.  Jodi deftly shows how its not always the ones you think will wind up in trouble that often get overlooked and in the process run adrift of the world, winding up in terrible circumstances that even the most vigilant parent may not see coming.<br /><br />I felt Josie's mother's character seemed a bit shallow for a judge and didn't symbolize the career woman that she was representing--changing her clothes three times before her first day on the bench and then throwing up twice before going to the courthouse.  No one knows what she's wearing under her robes! She's supposed to be an accomplished attorney who has tried hundreds of cases!  Also, not immediately recusing herself from this case was another stretch too far.  And, what about Peter's brother?  This was an area that could have been delved into deeper and may have helped with the overall understanding of Peter's actions.  Since it was not developed, it may have been better let out??<br /><br />The stereotypes of the various cliques were probably a bit pedantic but characteristic of what goes on in schools.  I can still remember the ones who were picked on and made fun of when I went to school.  But I actually believe, with all the litigation and the restraints on teachers, children today could actually be crueler than in years gone by.  And, with all the blended families and dysfunction in general, it's fortunate that children are more resilient than we truly know or this could be an even greater problem than it already is.<br /><br />I almost felt that the added twist near the ending was a plot device constructed to provide a \\"shocking\\" turn of events.  It seemed a bit forced.  While it may have been alluded to, it was not developed enough to be believable and therefore probably could have been eliminated for the sake of flow and consistency.  Also, it was incongruent with Josie's actions before and after the shooting, as well as her character generally.  While she was always Peter's protector, this act was way out of character for her and just didn't fit.<br /><br />I haven't decided if I really liked all the bouncing around the book did.  While this often works for plots that cover long periods or different timeframes, it was almost distracting in this storyline.  However, I believe Jodi did her research and I imagine that a story of this kind would be hard to tell.  Unfortunately, we'll never know in many cases what actually leads up to final shoot outs because the shooters generally do not live to stand trial. But human nature wants to know why and we'd also like it to be a BIG why, (physical abuse, sexual abuse, deranged parents, religious zealots with misguided beliefs, etc.) not the seemingly \\"usual\\" harassing climate that permeated Nineteen Minutes.<br /><br />Overall, this was a tragic story and worth the read, especially for high school and junior high students who might not recognize the long term effects of their everyday actions. I can't quite express what it is about this book that made it less than the sum of its parts, but I wasn't as impressed with the writing as I would have expected considering the topic.  However, while this is not my favorite Picoult book, I admire Jodi's willingness to tackle contemporary, relevant, and highly charged themes with compassion.ve been eliminated for the sake of flow and consistency.

B000002U8G|3.0|This won't be confused with Dark Side of the Moon or The Wall, but this early effort shows Floyd growing into the musical geniuses they became.  \\"One of these days\\" remains a Floyd classic, and \\"Echoes\\" becomes better and better with each listen.
0679731725|5.0|Usually, movies and novels don't mix.  If one is poignant and relevant, the other is utter crap.  In the case of The Remains of the Day, though, this is definitely not true:  the movie actually *enhances* the book, and vice versa.<br /><br />This novel takes place in post-WWII England, laden with pre-WWII flashbacks.  The story of Stevens, the obedient butler of Lord Darlington, is not for the action-adventure lover:  it is a quiet, almost meditative story that contemplates love, war, obedience, the working class, and patriotism.  The story is slow but rich; if you liked The English Patient or Schindler's List, you will enjoy this book.<br /><br />I had seen the movie several times before I settled into the novel; I have found that it's especially pleasant if you can hear Stevens in your mind in the voice of Anthony Hopkins.

B000OPOANE|4.0|Rush has always been known for being a progressive band. That's what they do. Change. It's their middle name. I love this album, because it is different. Different producer, different arrangements, different sound. Different! Some of the previous review(ees) are way too anal. Talking chords and meters. Expecations set way too high. There is no other band that has this degree of musical talent. It doesn't matter whether it's better or worse than previous, it's just their style at this time in their lives. Period! If you are a rush fan, you should always appreciate the degree of professionalism and musicianship that goes into every one of their albums. No one else does it better. Is it the perfect album? Can their ever be a perfect album? Probably not, but it's very versatile, dynamic and DIFFERENT! Just the way I like it. After more than 30 years, at least they are consistent (in a progressive way)!

And it's interesting to note his change in philosophy about technology i.e. his ATM card. Still, Reacher taps into his depth of investigative knowledge to make another great novel for Lee Child. Can't wait for the next one.

B0001QNFXW|5.0|I'm a big fan of Jamiroquai. However, I have only seen them live once ever and that concert was a bit of a disappointment really. It was at the Filmore in SF in late 2005. I thought the band seemed a little tired (it was their next to last stop in the US after already doing a European tour). Anway, after that I didn't think Jamiroquai was a good live band and just good on CDs. Well this DVD proves that wrong. The Verona Italy show is great. Jay doesn't let the horrible weather (heavy rain at an outdoor venue) get in his way and neither do any of the band. They put on a great show ... sounded like their album tracks and the set/stage was well done. They rocked Italians' world. If you want to see one of the top funk/rock/pop bands at their live best this is the DVD for you.

B00003CXSP|3.0|Julianne Moore is a phenomenal actress in other movies, but for some reason didn't bring the character of Clarice Starling to life on the silver screen for \\"Hannibal\\". Her portrayal of Clarice Starling was extremely flat and dead compared with Jodie Foster's performance of Clarice Starling in \\"Silence of the Lambs\\". So, I was sorely disappointed not to see Jodie Foster return to play the role of Clarice Starling in this movie as she gave a vibrant portrayal of this character.    I've also read the book \\"Hannibal\\" by Thomas Harris and was completely disappointed that the filmmakers of \\"Hannibal\\" didn't keep the ending of the movie in line with that of the novel. The ending of \\"Hannibal\\", the movie version, felt empty and hollow without the original ending for which the author had intended.    Plus other aspects of the storyline were a bit off too. Had \\"Hannibal\\", the movie version, had Jodie Foster playing Clarice Starling and other aspects of the movie, like the ending, been more accurate to the novel, I would have given it a higher rating.

B000H1QYXY|4.0|It is well over twenty years since I first heard Careless Whisper. My children were playing a tape of it during a long car journey, and it caught my attention and has haunted my recollection ever since. My own musical home ground is classical, and I have never followed the charts to any great extent. However music to me is just music, its effect is unpredictable and irrational, and there is never any mistaking the unaccountable thrill that some music can give me, whatever category of music it supposedly belongs in.<br /><br />This set has just been given to me as a birthday present by one of the children, who are now of course adults. The idea is apparently to take me out of my classical comfort zone, but if one thing has consistently struck me in half a century of hearing pop music it is just how conservative it is in certain ways. The harmonisation would in general have seemed unenterprising to composers in the year 1700, yet this is the kind of music that millions really listen to and are really affected by. From this I have to draw the conclusion that a simple harmony that lasts unaltered through untold numbers of changes of musical fashion, style and idiom can hardly be thought of as outmoded, whatever the earnest intellectual theories of the 20th century.<br /><br />George Michael has apparently composed most of the music here himself, and I certainly seem to detect a resemblance in the style of many of the numbers. Unsurprisingly, I like some of them better than some others, and still none matches up to Careless Whisper for me. Bottom of the charts for me is the joint number with Elton John `Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me', I have to say. However something that does a lot for even the items that interest me less from a musical viewpoint is George Michael's voice. This is really most striking and distinctive in its higher register, a fine tenor sound that will continue to keep me listening to songs that would not hold my attention otherwise.<br /><br />Whether I was in that much of a musical comfort zone I rather doubt, but the matter is not for me to judge. I am not at all comfortable with some 20th century `classical' music and I am rarely uncomfortable with the pops, even if only intermittently interested. This set is going to be chiefly background music for me, I'm sure, but it's mainly new music to me at the moment. I'm not shaken in the least although I genuinely am stirred up to a point. Why should that be otherwise? It's music innit?of a musical comfort zone I rather doubt, but the matter is not for me to judge.

B000957O82|5.0|Every role is perfectly cast in this romantic comedy/buddy movie. Kevin James and Will Smith are funny, but never over-the-top in roles that could have gone silly with less capable actors.     The movie is also a love affair with Manhattan. Every scene takes place in one distinctly New York spot after another. I loved each one.      By the way, the soundtrack for Hitch is great, too.
0385522401|4.0|I've been meaning to read McEwan forever.  So many books, so little time.  On Chesil Beach was the perfect solution.  It can be easily read in a sitting.<br /><br />It is the story of Edward and Florence on their wedding night on the British coast in 1962.  Almost all of the action takes place in that one evening, with flashbacks that tell the tale of these two young people's lives and the entire history of their relationship.  They're both so young, and innocent and scared.  Even though 1962 isn't that much before my time, reading this book it felt like a period drama from another century.  It was a different world.<br /><br />It became immediately obvious what everyone says is true.  McEwan writes beautifully, just beautifully, but the novel is not especially difficult or challenging.  What impressed me the most was how concisely but fully he told his story.  Highly recommended.

B000OCXFCO|4.0|The last LP of Megadeth - The System Has Failed - was a journey, going back to the roots of what has defined THE Megadeth sound. The journey continues with this album.<br /><br />Riffs? Yes, though not as good as in the Rust in Peace era. Singing? He does sing,  within the lines of the So Far So Good LP (sings in a talking way), which I do believe is an asset. This is an angry record with a lyrical content about being anti-government/war/UN/etc. The production is more or less the same as in The System Has Failed, which I do beleive is a clear but still metal sounding. Do not expect 'billboard charts topping wannabe' version of Megadeth (as it was the case in Risk). Warning! No power ballads like Promises (thx to them for that). And, do not expect to listen to a genre defining sound and style as it was in the case of Peace Sells and So Far So Good, but still this is a good album to listen to.<br /><br />Then the golden question: Is this metal? Hell yeah it is. Maybe not for everyone. The Black Metal people may find it too commercial, the Metallica people (at least the new ones) may find it too metal. Why not five stars?<br /><br />I have been listening to them for so long that I can not be objective. With a strong discography like Megadeth's, this is a 4 star album; as they have been here done that and did it better actually. No offence though, feel free to buy it, but do not expect a Holy Wars, Wake Up Dead, Symphony of Destruction...

B0000844M8|5.0|A beautiful film, with stunning cinematography of the Kenyan landscape and the myriad creatures who inhabit it, \\"Born Free\\" is also a touching tale of love and sacrifice. The childless Adamsons raise Elsa almost as their own offspring, then confront the necessity of sending her away. Just how they accomplish this is both selfless and painstaking. Grand score by John Barry only adds to the visual and emotional sweep of this ideal family movie.
B00005JPQT|4.0|I must admit that I found myself a little bored at times, not to mention that some of the dialogue was pretty bad. I actually liked the movie more as it approached an hour or so into the mayhem. Bruce Willis did seem to be just going through the motions, especially early on, but he still had some clever lines and action scenes later in the film. Justin Long, as the helpless computer nerd, was much funnier than I thought he would be and really got the most laughs out of my packed theater.<br /><br />All in all, the PG-13 rating didn't hurt the violence one bit, but having John McClane not throw aroung the F word every few lines really felt out of place in a Die Hard movie. Even his famous line is muffled by a gunshot.<br /><br />Still worth seeing if you like mindless action, with a little humor thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />3.5 out of 5 stars

The scenery  is breathtaking and the movie flowed very well with superb  performances by almost everyone.  When the DVD came out I wanted to get the better picture  and audio effect.  The Cinematography is breathtaking.  The clearness of the scenes is great.    I was disappointed by the cuttings in the Director's   \\"Expanded Edition\\".  To much was cut and not enough   was added.  The VHS cinematography is close to the DVD.  You have more continuity in the movie, and don't have to  listen to Russell Means (usually brillant) ramble at the  end and make the final moments of great emotion into a  a rambling.    Save your money and stick with the VHS.

0790731509|5.0|\\"Luke\\" is a work that transformed Newman from movie star to anti-authoritarian folk hero. Clearly the actor was attracted to the dispossessed, in life and in film. His Luke is two things at once: a loser whose drunkenness lands him on a chain gang, but also a tough individualist equipped with personal courage and a defiant spirit. Top-notch support comes from Martin as Luke's wormy nemesis, and Kennedy, who won an Oscar for his turn as Luke's loyal pal, Dragline.
B000FTWB7G|1.0|The result is musically dull melodrama with nothing to give it worth other than Amy's fabulous voice.

I suspect the change in line-up has a lot to do with this; the real musician/songwriter obviously left the band. I suspect that this is the last we will ever hear from Evanesence. Hopefully, Amy Lee will do better with her next project.

I don't think it's fair to compare this book with the Kite Runner even though it is written by the same author. They're two different stories altogether, both with a powerful message to give. I actually liked the way this booked ended, though, because it has a happy ending and puts forth a call to action. Some have said this story follows a predictable formula, but I honestly didn't see that climax coming. I highly recommend this novel. It's depressing, but inspirational.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|Apparently Clive Davis offered Clarkson a hefty sum to stay with the same formulaic standard that was making him money off of her in the past.  It took guts to stand by her artistic vision in the face of the music moguls and public scrutiny.  Who really understands the artists vision best, the mogul or the artist?  Too bad Clive did not have the guts Kelly has because this is one fine album.  While the music industry churns out pop-tarts that have no real musical direction of their own, we see them lose perspective and fall victim to the big machine.  This has been in evidence as of late, with many promising young stars getting sucked in under the wheels of the so called moguls Bentleys, much to their detriment. Not so with Kelly Clarkson.  This young woman knows who she is and who she is not, and she is not a victim.  \\"My December\\" is a mature, heartfelt collection of songs that should have a broad appeal.  These songs are so solid they do not require the great vocal acrobatics we all know Clarkson can employ.  \\"Never Again\\" does remind one of Alanis Morissette's in your face, \\"You Oughta Know\\", but so what?  If an artist is not going to be real and honest, why bother?  \\"Never Again\\" flat out rocks and has more hooks than needed to hang a shower curtain. Songs like \\"Maybe\\" and \\"Sober\\" are truly artistic in that they are subjective.  These songs can be interpreted in many ways and applied to ones own life experiences making them soundtracks to an individuals own situation. Albums with material like this stand the test of time and endure as personal soundtracks just as \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" did for Alanis and \\"Tapestry\\" did for Carole King.  While these records are vastly different, the concept holds.  But the songs on \\"My December\\" are thought provoking and a pleasure to indulge oneself in.  Clarkson's vocals are strong and poignant just like the lyrics she sings.  She has surrounded herself with a talented line-up of musicians who bring her vision to life.  This album may lose some of Kelly's audience but gain her a new following.  An artist who is growing is not going to keep doing the same music over and over, and Clarkson is growing and improving.  There is not a bad song on this cd.  This is definetly her bravest and best work. Buy it.
B00005JKGO|5.0|Daring for its time, Fellini's Oscar-nominated \\"Vita\\" is often remembered for the zaftig Anita Ekberg's swim in the Trevi Fountain and for the very first shot in the film, of a statue of Jesus being lifted over the city of Rome by helicopter. Yet its almost three hours' running time includes a procession of unforgettable images and scenes, as Mastroianni--in a sublime performance--marches numbly into the vacuous, debauched life of modern-day celebrity in Rome, finally succumbing to the empty, forced frivolity surrounding him. A sharply observed, absorbing study of dizzying decadence.

B000002G7G|5.0|The Velvet Underground truly were ahead of their time and became inventors of being the first New York noise band; a sound that soon became punk.<br />This album, their self titled third is far from the sound heard on the Velvets earlier albums -The Velvet Underground w/ Nico- & 1968's White Light/White Heat which is a release that turned the guitar fuzz up a couple notches and contains one of the band's best songs with \\"Sister Ray\\"-<br /><br />Their third Lp released in 1969, however is all sweetness. A more relaxed type of atmosphere, but the songs, all classic are some of their best ever. Lou Reed by now has upgraded to become an articulate songcrafter.<br />This is especially evident on songs like \\"Pale Blue Eyes\\" and \\"The Murder Mystery\\"<br /> By now with this album the Velvet Underground became folky balladeers after John Cale's departure, changing the shape of their \\"alt\\" noise to gorgeous tunes.<br />I do think Lou Reed's vocals sound best on this one, my personal favorite by The Velvet Underground. I like it more then the three main other studio releases and better then their next \\"Loaded\\"<br />Like I said earlier this album is filled with classics, but my favorites are \\"Candy Says\\" - \\"What Goes On\\" - \\"Pale Blue Eyes\\" - \\"Beginning to See the Light\\" and the closer Maureen Tucker (drummer) sings \\"After Hours\\"<br />Simply Remarkable and a well worth it five stars.
B000002MTU|5.0|First of all, who are you to say what the blues really is about, and who is allowed to play it. Blues is not about race, age, sex, nationality, etc. Blues is about feeling and experience. Eric is a white guy from England with a heavy british accent. He cannot help that. If you do not think that he deserves to play the blues, then you do not know much about his life. Besides, the guitar playing alone is full of feeling and is a tribute to all of the old time blues players. He is not in competition with them; he is merely paying homage to their music and to the blues This Cd is just incredible. This cd features ECs finest playing. I would give this cd 50 stars if I could.

I just had to get me some Johnny Cash and see what the big deal was.  The thing I like about him is that he is such a great story teller.  Every song he sings makes you believe that what he is singing about  happened to you. To me, it really doesn't sound like country at all.  It's more like blues with a little country and rock mixed in.  I can see why the \\" Folsom Prison \\" album was his best album.  The songs he did on this album are some his best work.  Some of my favorites are \\" Cocaine Blues \\", \\" Jackson \\", \\" Busted \\".  and \\" I Got Stripes \\" just to name a few.  If you don't know, or your not a big country fan like I was.  Pick up this cd and let Johnny Cash the man in black make a believer  out of you.
B000BTGY1O|5.0|Adapted from Truman Capote's novella, Edwards's fleet-footed romantic comedy would not be the cultural touchstone it is without the effervescent presence of Hepburn. As Holly Golightly, a small-town Texas girl with her feet planted firmly in the glitz of New York's party scene, Hepburn is irrepressibly charming, a vision of elflike beauty in Givenchy and pearls. But she is also a frail creature harboring secrets, and Hepburn plays both sides exquisitely. Peppard is solid and likable as writer Paul, Holly's admirer and confidante, while Patricia Neal chews on her steely role as Paul's wealthy older mistress. A chic, iconic romance, memorably set to the Oscar-winning strains of Henry Mancini's \\"Moon River.\\"

B000000XK5|5.0|Ella Fitzgerald remains The Lady Of Song despite the passing of the years; and her performance on this CD with guitarist Joe Pass stuns me with its beauty. Ella and Joe fit together so well; and every moment of this CD proves it.<br /><br />Ella starts off by singing \\"My Ship.\\" \\"My Ship\\" showcases Ella's remarkable ability to deliver a love song with great sensitivity and panache. Joe's soft and supple guitar playing awes me; his solo on this number proves he's one of the best guitar players Ella could have picked for her partner on this album.<br /><br />\\"Don't Be That Way\\" starts off with a brief guitar solo; and when Ella comes in she plays with the tempo of her vocals to make \\"Don't Be That Way\\" a wonderful number! Ella scats a while and never misses a note as some singers do with this number that seems deceptively easy to deliver. \\"My Man\\" gets the royal treatment from Ella; she sings this with all the passion any woman would feel for her male lover. Ella lowers her voice to sing this softly; and this embellishes \\"My Man.\\"<br /><br />Other great treats on this CD include \\"The Days Of Wine And Roses.\\" \\"The Days Of Wine And Roses\\" shows us Ella singing from all the corners of her wide vocal range of way more than just one octave. By this time you realize that this CD is one of Ella's best even though it was recorded late in her career. \\"Love For Sale\\" starts with Ella humming very soulfully; and she sings her vocals magnificently. Ella again plays with the tempo of her vocals to enhance this number; and Joe Pass makes the guitar accompaniment seem so easy although we know it really wasn't easy at all.<br /><br />\\"On Green Dolphin Street\\" has some great key changes from the very start; I love it! Ella sings with all her heart of the memories she still holds dear. Joe Pass again gets a guitar solo that truly amazes me. He's right up there with the best of them!<br /><br />\\"By Myself\\" was featured in the Judy Garland movie entitled I Could Go On Singing; and Ella's interpretation would make Judy proud indeed. Joe plays very softly in order to showcase Ella's voice and set it apart from the guitar. Ella's voice is therefore placed squarely in front of the musical arrangement; this helps to deliver a sad song about a person who must live life alone. This heart wrenching song never fails to move me.<br /><br />The CD ends with \\"Slow Boat To China;\\" this song features the dream and joy of having your lover all to yourself for quite some while to come. The upbeat melody gets a slower than usual tempo here; but it still works well. You also get yet another guitar solo from Joe Pass. Great!<br /><br />The liner notes include an essay about Ella, Joe and the songs written by Benny Green; and the cover artwork features a tasteful photo of Ella and Joe performing together.<br /><br />Ella Fitzgerald and Joe Pass fans will consider this a \\"must-have\\" for their collections; and fans of classic pop vocals will enjoy this CD, too.eed.

B000IZJZLM|5.0|Il Divo is the type of group that you love from the beggining.....I have followed their short career and whenever I hear them sing I fall in love with their voices, their feeling....I hope they get to keep up singing....They deserve all the success in the world.....I love their duets with Barbra and Celine Dion....Their voices blend like magic....
B00004XPPE|5.0|Of all the edgy doomsday thrillers that have unnerved us since the 1960s, nothing beats Sidney Lumet's chilling \\"Fail-Safe.\\" Throughout the film, set in the control room of Strategic Air Command, Lumet expertly uses his camera to build claustrophobia and tension. The scenes with Fonda as the President and young Hagman as a petrified Russian translator are especially riveting. Walter Matthau also makes your blood run cold playing against type as a dispassionate nuclear-arms expert. Made when Cold War paranoia was at its height, this is a masterwork of relentless suspense.

B000MV8AE0|4.0|If you watch this movie and know something about Beethoven's last years, you ask yourself, why would someone possibly want to alter reality in such a way. For many purists this fictionalization of Beethoven's character is very annoying. However, Agnieszka Holland found in this script by Stephen J. Rivele and Christopher Wilkinson a true inspiration to analyze these last fertile years. Anna Holz, the talented copyist that is sent to help the Maestro in the rush to issue the script for the first representation of the 9th Symphony, is actually a device utilized by the director to pose the questions that we would have asked if we had been there. She is the key to comprehension. Anna consents us to discover the significance of the change in key, the effect of a half note, the impact of deafness on composition of music, the value of the interval between the notes. Anna (played with great control and introspection by Diane Kruger) independently of her narrated life, her absent father, her nun aunt, her handsome and stolid fianc&eacute;e actually is not a character, she does not live a life of her own outside her relationship with Beethoven and the feelings she inspires in the Maestro are purely intellectual. The dissimulated love story is naturally present and it probably reaches its apex right before the start of the choral during the representation of the 9th Symphony, but it is cold, mental, there is no physical passion whatsoever. There is a truly  magic moment during which we see the faces of the female singers that are waiting for the cue to start singing.<br />Ed Harris' Beethoven has all the flare and the defects we imagine and know of the genius. His interpretation of brutality toward others and weakness towards his nephew is magistral, but he seems not to have a relationship with Anna. He sees her as an angel, a gift of God, a warning that death is near, an opportunity to think that his genius is understood and will live on. She is a sign of Fate or Destiny maybe?<br />As in all Holland's movies the cinematography is beautiful and reconstruction of period costumes is perfect. The use of candlelight, and ink, and food renders exactly the right atmosphere.<br />Once suspended disbelief, this intellectual reconstruction of Beethoven's creativity of the last years is fascinating and a pleasure to see and the temptation to believe its true is really there.ll Holland's movies the cinematography is beautiful and reconstruction of period costumes is perfect.

0385040253|5.0|This is a fantastic book of knots.  I would caution though that it is not an unstructional book with step by step details on how to tie the knots.  If you have a basic understanding of knots you can figure out how to tie most of the knots in the book and with some practice and research you could get to where you could manage to tie anything I'm sure.  This is a book that I thought I would add to my library but it seems I take it everywhere with me as I am fascinated with the different knots that I can continue to learn and teach to others.
B000QEILLK|5.0|Thank you Murat, for the fine review.  I agree with everything you mentioned.  I give the album 5 stars; it's that good.
B000MX7V5M|5.0|Filmed in VistaVision by Oscar winner Robert Burks, Hitchcock's swanky, breezy suspense film takes a simple idea--one cat burglar on the tail of another--and spins it into cinematic gold. With his customary wit and sexual innuendo, the director positions tanned star Cary Grant on a collision course with the resplendent Kelly, who never looked more ravishing as spoiled heiress Francie Stevens (Kelly), especially in a wide-brimmed white sun hat and bathing outfit Jackie O would have coveted. When they kiss, there are literally fireworks on-screen, a technique Hitch used to keep the censors from snipping his film. You'll have a lot of fun catching this \\"Thief.\\"
B000QFAJ7S|1.0|What a waste of money this CD is! Kelly is trying to be so cool and anti-Idol and it just doesn't work. How embarassing. I tried to be objective and listen to this with an open mind and ears but it was almost painful. None of the songs have hooks to draw the listener in. There is no melody or even catchy lyrics on any of the songs. Diehard fans will buy this album but probably won't listen to it after a week or two. Kelly needs to remember who her audience is...the same people who put her in the spotlight...and cater to them. We want soaring ballads and sing-a-long songs. Little Miss Independent is trying to be Janis Joplin and she is ending up looking like a fool. I accidentally stepped on my poor cat's tail this afternoon and her screech sounded better than anything on \\"My December\\".  Note to Kelly:  You've shown us that you're \\"cool\\"...now give us what we want to hear before you wind up like Sinead O'Connor!
B000OYC3J8|5.0|Absolutely amazing!  Incredible guitar and lots of interesting variety.  Catch Hell Blues is wonderful!
B00006JSS8|4.0|This CD is good sample of the great Stevie Wonder. The CD worth the amount paid and remind me some nice songs. If you like Steve Wonder buy it!
B00003CXAA|5.0|It's a great set for the price.  I haven't seen the movies in years, the quality is great and the special features are also very good!
B00008RH1H|5.0|A brilliant re-imagining of Shakespeare's \\"Macbeth\\" in feudal Japan, Kurosawa's gripping 1957 tragedy is a less frenetic, more haunting outing than previous films like \\"Seven Samurai.\\" Yet it's still visually potent, containing unforgettable images of austere beauty within a persistently tense and eerie atmosphere. Yamada's character, modeled on Lady Macbeth, is sensationally chilling, while the outsize Mifune's breath-catching demise in a hail of piercing arrows is something every film lover should see more than once. For a provocative East-meets-West experience, mount \\"Throne of Blood.\\"
1594489505|5.0|If possible, even better than Hosseini's first book The Kite Runner. A tremendously moving portrait of life in a country which has been brutalized beyond words, and of its most terrible victims, its women and children.
B000BCE918|5.0|Great fun to watch again these 3 great movies with my daughter. Very good presentation for a good price. Great value.
1594489505|5.0|Every once in awhile you stumble on a gem of a book which totally changes or widens your prospective of thinking.  \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" was such a book.  It centered around the interconnecting lives of to women Miraim, the plainer, older women who was an illegimate child and has a quiet, survivng spirit she doesn't know she possess, and Laila, the beautiful, liberal (as compared to the Taliban that is), bold women and daugter of a schoolteacher, and how the political turmoil of Afganstan affects and shapes their life.      While Miraim had always had a difficult childhood, with her father's refusal of acknowleging her his child, her mother's suicide, and her young marraige to an abusive husband named Rasheed, Laila had a decent one with a doting father, a kind yet depressed mother, and a best friend named Tariq who she falls in love with.  Everything changes for Laila however when Tariq and his family move away to escape the turmoil in Afganastan, and Laila parents are killed by a bomb, and she is orphaned.  Miraim's and Laila's lives become entertwined when she then agrees to become the second wife of Rasheed.    This book is amazing because it deftly explores the relationship between women, the relationship between parent and child, the relationship between lovers, and the relationship between husbands, without romantizing or exateratting it.  It's a story celebrating the spirit of these amazing women and truly of all women, and their ability to survive- Laila with her bold tongue and opinions, Mariam with her earnest, beautiful quiet strength.  The backdrop- the political turmoil of Afganastan beginning with the communist invasion in the 70's and ending in the aftermath of 9/11 not only effectively educates one, but also makes the exploration of a culture which we have seen in a steryotypical light protrayed by the media, but do not truly understand that much more impacting.    From this book I gained a new perspective, and better understood about a cultureI knew little of.  Though Hosseini tended to get a tiny bit sentimental at the end of the book, and while at the end of the book I found the switch in tense a bit unexpected- though it did add something to this novel- for the most part, Hosseini wrote in sparse, lovely prose which could be absolutly haunting.  He didn't play with flowery words but always got to the bones of the story- a quality which many writers should learn.  Nor was Hosseini afraid of some disturbing imagery- there were some abuse scenes which literally made me frigtened and anxious for the charaters forgetting that they were fictional.  This novel was always tightly wound, and well-paced so I literally could not put it down.  Furthermore, Hosseini, though he chose to write in third person never made one feel detached from the characters- you knew them, and could sympatzie with the good ones and absolutly hate/pity the bad but you always cared for them.  The characters where either hot or cold- never lukewarm.    Sometimes finding a amazing book can feel like going on a quest for the Holy Grail- an illusive quest where one keeps searching but they never find it.  Yet then you stumble onto a book like this, of such scope and literay power.  This is the type of book which reminds me once again of the power of the written word and why I for one love to read.
B0000WN0ZK|5.0|Antonioni's existential mystery scandalized some in the 1960s with its cool, casually erotic atmosphere of sex and drugs, but still made a sizeable dent at the box office. In addition to the film's central puzzle--was there a homicide or not?--Hemmings himself is a kind of cipher, playing a detached, unsmiling artist bored with his decadent life. With its mod flavorings and occasional surrealist touches--like a pantomime tennis game--\\"Blow-Up\\" is an intriguing, unconventional thriller that makes you question the nature of reality and illusion.
B000QFAJ7S|2.0|I loved her first 2 albums. Breakaway, of course, being the better of the 2. But with My December I have to wonder where she went wrong. Why is it so bad? Is it because she co-wrote on every song? Is it because it took forever for this album to actually come out? Or is it simply because every song is so poorly written and choppy, with lyrics SO cliche that they could have been written by Avril Lavigne. Lyrics we've all heard in hundreds of other pop songs. Better pop songs at that. Whatever the reason, this album is just bad.<br /><br />I found myself becoming so annoyed by the terrible beats of almost every song that I had to skip through most after only a minute or less. What happened to the catchiness of her music? its just no longer there.<br /><br />There are 2 tracks that stand out among the garbage shes trying to pass off as music. Never Again and Sober. Never Again is a pretty good song with great, original lyrics and i love how its more rock than pop. And Sober is just beautiful<br /><br />As much as I would love to, I cannot recommend this highly disappointing album. Not for only 2 good songs. And as for the people giving this album good reviews, I can't imagine you actually enjoy this. And you call yourselves fans. Be honest.<br />Better luck next time, Kelly.
B000MQ55IE|5.0|I have listened to Beck from the beginning and even saw him on the Odelay tour in '96.  In concert he is funny and amazingly talented.  Through the years Beck has released special editions, bonus discs, as well as multiple covers (4 for Sea Change) and a b-sides collection.  Each time I have bought something Beck has released it has always been well worth the money spent, and this Deluxe edition is no exception.  You truly feel that Beck is deliverling on his promise to see each album not as static, but as an evolving piece of art that continues when the audience experiences the music.  Here you get the 4 sticker sheets, and the 2 official videos, one of which was on TV.  In addition you get 3 great B-sides, 2 of which were free downloads one from Best Buy and one from Target.  The DVD also has a video for each song of the homegrown variety as seen with the Guero release.  What is also a surprise is how great the remix CD is.   It could be titled 'Midnight Vultures variations'  because it is a disc full of great remixes that retain the core melody and music of the originals.  It truly is a remix album where the songs really work well together and can be listened to again and again.
0743496728|4.0|I have read several of Jodi Picoults books, all of which kept me so intrigued I did not want to put the books down. Nineteen Minutes overall was a great read, the only thing I did not like about the book was the constant jumping from 1 Character's point of view to another's, this style of writing has never appealed to me. A definite read for Middle School/High School Children.
B00005JSGK|5.0|Good-natured, leisurely Hawks-Wayne outing features gorgeous on-location shooting, with exciting footage of wild animal chases (the crew races after them in a jeep with nets), and effective ensemble playing from Cabot, Red Buttons, and Hardy Kruger, who comprise Mercer's core team. Martinelli is more than just ornamental as Dallas- we can well understand how she might get under Sean's supposedly thick skin. Catchy, distinctive Mancini score completes this exuberant, diverting picture, ideal for all ages.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Beautiful photography. Totally educational without the droning facts. Makes you feel a real part of our planet.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|By now I'm sure everyone knows about the controversy that surrounded this album, so I'm going to mention that as little as possible, suffice to say that Clive was too hard on Kelly and the album. \\"My December\\" is a crucial point in the American Idol contestant's albums, as it is in my opinion the first album by any Idol contestant to highlight their artistic ability.    Kelly puts her range of talents to the test by at least co-writing every song on the album, and furthermore the majority of the songs are written superbly. There are only a few lyrical weak spots on the album, which in itself is impressive considering how green Clarkson still is in this field. But more so then the lyrics, the music of these songs have substance that doesn't just go in one ear and out the other. My December is a tightly crafted Pandora's box of emotions, running from bitter to loving, but fitting together as a whole cohesive album opposed to just a jumble of ideas. Regardless of the fact that the songs aren't as radio friendly as those on \\"Breakaway\\", it does nothing to degrade the quality of the album.      Overall My December is an evolution of the pop rock sound Kelly began establishing on \\"Breakaway\\", and is not only Clarkson's best album, it's the best album by any Idol contestant yet. It's landmark album in the AI world as it shows that the show is starting to give us \\"artists\\" opposed to just \\"singers\\", and how appropriate that the first person to win Idol is the first to really \\"breakaway\\" as an artist. 5/5 Stars    Song Reviews  1. Never Again-Personally one of my least favorite songs on here. I don't have a problem with the bitter lyrics; I just don't think this song has great lasting appeal. Still, it's a decent song, and I'm sure people going through a bad break up will like it. 7.5/10    2. One Minute-A radio friendly song that could easily fit in with the big hits from Breakaway, this song is fast paced and poppy. It's a great sing a long song (thanks to the fun lyrics and fast beat), and really kicks off the album for me. 9.5/10    3. Hole-One of the heaviest rock songs on here (and a good one at that), this one has some dark but well written lyrics. Kelly sings \\"There's a hole inside of me, it's so damn cold, slowly killing me\\". Kelly begins to show real departure on this song as it's definitely different from anything she has done before. 9.5/10    4. Sober-Kelly has said this is her favorite on here. Although I prefer a few other songs to this one, this is undeniably a highlight not only of the album, but her career. The melody of the song is entrancing, and this contains some of her best writing on the album. Her singing is heartfelt as well. 10/10    5. Don't Waste Your Time-Currently my least favorite track on the album. It just seems forgettable to me, and the song is the only one on the album that strikes me as filler. It might grow on me though. 5/10    6. Judas-Another rock track, that's decent. It's not my favorite song on here, but it has uniqueness to it. However this is one of the weaker songs lyrically on the album, in my opinion. The lyrics aren't bad, they're just average. 7/10    7. Haunted-My personal favorite song not only on the album, but of Kelly's career to date. The song is just captivating from the atmosphere, to the way Kelly's voice emotes her scared and frantic pleas. I absolutely love this song and can just get lost in it. 10/10    8. Be Still-This song is about wanting to mend a broken relationship, and it has a soft and pleasant melody. The song is relaxing, and Kelly's voice sounds more beautiful then it ever has here. 9/10    9. Maybe- I've heard this song online for about a year or so, since she performed it on her previous tour, and I've always loved it. This is another mellow song. It's a very unusual almost repetitive song, but in a good way if that makes sense. It's about trusting the one you love, despite their faults. 9/10    10. How I Feel-Arguably the \\"Sine U Been Gone\\" of My December, inother words the catchiest song on here. This has a funky beat, with clever lyrics about how Kelly just can't seem to land the right guy, she sings \\"It seems every time I find a good man, he's got a good little wife.\\" Another one of my favorites, that's sure to be a big hit. 10/10    11. Yeah- I can see this one dividing fans the most, as it's no doubt the most eclectic track on the album. It's kind of like psychedelic rock meets R&B, but mixed with a little bit of pop. To me this is a fun departure from the rest of the album, while still managing to fit in with the overall feel of My December. 9/10    12. Can I Have a Kiss-This one took some time to grow on me, but it eventually did, and is yet another good track on My December. Much like \\"Maybe\\", Kelly is having relationship problems, and admits to her faults, while asking, \\"if I can't hold you, can I give you a kiss?\\"8.5/10    13. Irvine- My second favorite song of the album, this song is the best written track on here. The melody is unexplainable as it is just so different from any other song I've ever heard. It's best described as surreal, and that's kind of how I feel when I listen to it. It's an experimental and amazing track. 10/10    14. Chivas-The hidden song that Irvine segues into, not my favorite but at least it's interesting, and closes out the album nicely. 7/10    My Top 5:  1. Haunted  2. Irvine  3. Sober  4. How I Feel  5. One Minute
B00004SU5J|3.0|is my absolute favorite!  It's why I bought the cd.  I wasn't particularly crazy about a few of the tracks on the cd; however, after listening to in its entirety, I found myself enjoying more.  So my advice to those that are considering TOURIST, listen first, and you might actually find yourself with a gem.  ~Enjoy!
B000F0V0LI|5.0|Monument Valley never looked as breathtakingly beautiful as it does in this exquisite, richly faceted Western, perhaps the most accomplished film in John Ford's oeuvre. Wayne gives the performance of a lifetime as the obsessed, enigmatic Ethan, while young Natalie Wood is indelible in a brief role as Debbie, the kidnapped girl caught between worlds. Ford described his ambitious masterwork as a \\"psychological epic,\\" and this gut-twisting, high-lonesome tale certainly grows more nuanced with each viewing.
B000OCY7JE|5.0|Mads Mikklesen delivers a wonderful performance in After the Wedding . After the Wedding has a simple concept but it's anything but simple minded. Sussane Bier gets great performances from all her actors and the result is one of the best movies of 06'.
B000QFAJ7S|4.0|Kelly's third album is definitely very different from Breakaway.  It's got a more rock sound than pop.  A lot of the tunes deal with broken/failed relationships.  The album's reminiscent of Alanis Morisette's stuff from teh mid-90s, being rather dark and angry at times.  It's cool that Kelly's experimenting with different sounds and songs, and she's most definitely her own artist and a mature artist.  I give this album 4 stars though, not 5, because it's simply not as listenable as Breakaway.  The songs:    Never Again - hard rock.  Scorn directed at lying ex.    One Minute - \\"hard pop\\" if such a concept exists.  A jangly sound.    Hole - choppy guitar, edgy rock.  Kind of a grim song about feeling empty inside.    Sober - slow, kinda dreamy and musing.  Singer sounds tired and beat down for most part, with bursts of almost screaming.  Trying to \\"kick\\" an addiction to a bad man.    Dont Waste Your Time - resembles Breakaway material    Judas - fast and choppy.  Accusatory at a betrayer    Haunted - another song with angst    Be Still - slow and gentle and quiet, almost floats    Maybe - echo of Thankful stuff here, but more pleading in tone    How I Feel - fast and choppy.  Singer declars her disillusionment with a man    Yeah - has the feel of \\"American Woman\\", definite Hendrix flavor    Can I Have a Kiss - Mix of acoustic and electric.  Singing alternates betweeen soft and emotional.  Wants a guy's intimacy    Irvine - very slow, light, and almost airy.  Accoustic.  Sad and tired.    The hidden track is very well sung.  It's a gentle acoustic tune, but in the lyrics the singer is kissing off a guy as being worthless    Kelly's still got a future, no doubt.
1400063515|1.0|Taleb's concept is certainly not his: \\"absence of evidence is not evidence of absence\\" is as old as the Greek philosophers.  And is something anyone who studies science should already know.  It's one of the classic \\"logical fallacies\\".    That natural systems very often do NOT follow Gaussian distribution is something anyone who has taken intro stats should know.    That non-linear systems are common; that positive feedback loops exist in nature; these things we know.    Serious students of economics, physics, chemistry, climate, or biology may sometimes view the world through bell-curve tinted glasses.  So remind us.  But don't insult our intelligence by combining lack of originality with insufferable arrogance.
B000EXDS5M|5.0|At the close of the sixties, Paul Newman and up-and-comer Robert Redford would make the evergreen \\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,\\" the first of two hugely popular collaborations with director George Roy Hill. (The other was \\"The Sting.\\") No standard western, \\"Butch\\" romanticizes the true story of the infamous \\"Hole in the Wall\\" gang, creating the ultimate buddy picture, and (thanks to William Goldman's brilliant Oscar-winning screenplay), a movie that's by turns lyrical, hilarious, and tragic. An eternal crowd-pleaser.
1905236042|5.0|I work with children who have disabilities (cerebral palsy, autism, down syndrome, etc).  Every child has trully enjoyed these cards.  On the back the pose is broken down into 4 organized steps. It's neat to watch the kids figure out how to pose themselves.  I use them for stretching, attention and concentration, deep breathing to help calm, weight bearing/strengthening, and for social groups (there are partner poses as well). A few of the parents even purchased them for home!
B00005YW4H|5.0|This is such an outstanding production, so much better than the later(I think) CD.  Miss Jones should be careful which guitar players back her up.  She should stick to Bill Frizell or maybe she should try Mark Knoffler, if she can get him away from Emmy Lou.
B000O5B5FK|5.0|Having been a long time PT-aholic, I was both pleased and slightly surprised with FBP. This album stands uniquely apart from all other PT releases by its seemingly \\"concept album\\" approach. Though it contains a meer six tracks, every one of them is a gem. If you're a relatively new fan this album would be great to start with as it showcases the bands moods in an almost manic way. Songs like \\"Anesthetize\\" goes from somber, to heavy, to prog and then almost an ambient like outro, where as \\"My Ashes\\" and \\"Sentimental\\" are beautifully mellow in almost a \\"...On the Sunday of Life\\" quality. The title track starts pumping first off while the finale \\"Sleep together\\" offers a somewhat new side of the band while maintaining their signature styles. Porcupine Tree continues to evolve and push their musical genius to new levels.
B0002XNSY0|5.0|The most inspired piece of Cold War satire ever and one of the screen's supreme black comedies, Kubrick's 1964 \\"Strangelove\\" confronted jittery audiences in the aftermath of the Cuban Missile Crisis, and not long after the advent of the H bomb. With Kubrick's twisted genius as director and screenwriter in full bloom, and peerless performances by Peter Sellers (in three roles), Scott, and the unhinged Hayden, the film is unbearably funny and extremely disturbing all at once.
B000MQC9H4|2.0|I own the movies When Harry Met Sally, You've Got Mail, Sleepless in Seattle, Fever Pitch, 50 First Dates, What Women Want and pretty much any renowned chick flicks of our time.  Jude Law and Jack Black are in some of my favorite films.  In my opinion, Kate Winslet is one of the most talented young actresses out there.  Therefore this film should've been a perfect film for someone such as me  - which is why my disapointment with this film was so heartbreaking.  I agree with the other reviewers that the plot of the movie is not so original and is quite predictable.  However, most romantic comedies ARE predictable.  But what makes the other romantic comedies work is all the other elements that surround the story.  This film failed in almost all aspects of a romantic comedy.  The plot dragged on without much wit to keep it going.  The dialogue and punch lines which could have been memorable missed their entrances every time - very poor timing.  And even with such beautiful coupling like Jude Law and Cameron Diaz, I was not convinced by their romance.  One of my huge expectations of this film came from the fact that the director was Nancy Meyers - this was by far the biggest disappointment of all as she was the ultimate reason I wanted to see this film.  So disappointing.  It's no holiday.
B0002X314C|4.0|When shopping for the Kinky Boots Sound Track CD, Amazon popped up the movie DVD and I made the mistake of ordering that.  It took a very nice vendor an several weeks (plus postage) to return the item.    I placed an order for the CD on 6/16 and am still waiting for it.  It is taking a long time.
B000QFAJ7S|4.0|I was so excited to finally get this new cd I actually downloaded it late last night from I-tunes.  I love it!!!  I have always been a fan of Kelly's.  My two favorite songs are a little mellow, but I love the lyrics.  The first one is \\"Sober\\" and the second is \\"Maybe\\".  Like I said, it's slow, but you can still hear her strong vocals.  I am only giving this 4 stars because some of the songs I need to listen to a little more in order to appreciate them.  That is usually what I do with new cd's.  I listen to the songs and wait till they grow on me.  Kelly will probably always be my favorite regardless of what all of the critics say.  She has remained grounded and independent in a career that is focused on other peoples (critics etc) say.  Congrats Kelly on a cd you made your own.
B00005NC66|5.0|One of the more fascinating and important works in cinema, and a great, loving tribute to American film noir, Godard's \\"Breathless\\" epitomized the French New Wave with a minimal yet innovative tale of doomed love. The tremendous appeal of this movie comes from its innovative use of sound (Mozart meets French pop), handheld cameras, and jarring cuts--not to mention an ultra-hip swagger beautifully performed by Belmondo. The lovely, perky Seberg reinvigorates a female clich&eacute;--the gangster's moll--giving her a bit of bubbly pizzazz. Shot on location in the City of Lights, \\"Breathless\\" is an energetic fusion of high art and pop culture that's not to be missed.
B00006HAZG|1.0|A terrible adaptation of the novel.  This movie cannot begin to capture the true essence of David Copperfield.  Poorly scripted, casted and directed. Ideas are conveyed in the movie which aren't even in the book while major concepts and instances are blatantly ignored.  If you respect Dickens work then don't buy this movie.  You'll be sorely cheated if you do.
B000QFAJ7S|4.0|This sums it up.  Yes, I liked \\"Thankful\\"...her take on Danielle Brisbois' \\"Just Missed The Train\\" was great...but it was overall too \\"Idol\\"-ish for me to love it...I HATE American Idol with a passion BTW...\\"Breakaway\\" was a great guilty pleasure, with songs that merged alt-rock and powerpop with commercial bubblegum successfully...too much of the commercial element made it no more than a guilty pleasure, but her writing was on the right track.<br /><br />Now, for \\"My December\\"...the REAL Kelly has emerged from the commercial murk that Idol and Clive Davis thrust upon her and she almost was not able to escape the shackles of...this is NOT \\"Breakaway Pt 2\\" by any means...if anything, \\"My December\\" is like a Rilo Kiley record with drops of Patty Griffin, Garbage, and one song that's like Nightwish or a better Evanescence...I hear a drop of Pat Benatar, but more Rilo Kiley because Pat Benatar was always commercial...RK has the big-voiced Jenny Lewis but with a dark indie rock/slightly powerpop vibe.<br /><br />Are there any obvious commercial hits on this disc???  Nope, not a one...is that a bad thing???  Nope, not at all.  Hits overshadow good album tracks...this record, all the songs are on an even playing field.  Kelly is in wonderful voice throughout, and she knows the meaning of restraint, and really FEELING what it is she's singing...her songwriting is not perfect, but she's headed in the right direction.  Commercial songwriting is cliched, bland, trite and predictable...none of the songs on \\"My December\\" have those traits...instead, we find actual DEPTH...honest darkness and real feelings.  And melodically, it's strong and subtle, but not-at-all-obvious...the tunes sneak up on you and don't hit you right away, a good thing...people call this a grower.<br /><br />All the flack she's gotten from Clive and the label shows that the labels fear substance and music that's REAL...as I've told many people, commerciality ruins music...<br /><br />Hopefully, \\"My December\\" causes the trite music played on radio to be dropped and we only get more meaningful, substantial music to savor.  People are hungry for it...regardless on how this record will not be promoted, it will sell regardless, as a protest.<br /><br />All the songs are good-to-great, but my personal fave might be \\"Maybe\\", the way it builds...<br /><br />Go Kelly, you have my support...and I have a feeling \\"Breakaway\\" was a transitional record...future records will be even better than \\"My December\\", but this is good work...BTW, Mike Watt plays bass on 4 of the tracks...he's the bass maestro behind punk legends the Minutemen and Firehose, and is currently in the Stooges, Iggy Pop's legendary proto-punk band...his feel is all over those songs, and David Kahne produced, along with Paul McCartney's new wonderful \\"Memory Almost Full\\".<br /><br />Again, go Kelly!!!!  You have credibility for putting out a great record, standing by it, sticking it to Clive and RCA...if you caved and did \\"Breakway Pt 2\\", including that song originally on Lindsay Lohan's record that Clive tried to get you to do, I would have lost respect for you...but you didn't, so your credibility is intact.n radio to be dropped and we only get more meaningful, substantial music to savor.

B00004R99U|1.0|Seeing as how Pocahontas was the worlds best animated film to date you would think that the sequal would be almost, if not quite as good as the original. This film however was a huge disappointment to me. There is only one remotely good song in it. And John Rolfe can't hold a candle to John Smith!
B0002O7XWC|5.0|The ultimate counter-culture classic, Hopper's \\" Rider\\" jolted a Hollywood in transition when it became an unexpected hit in 1969, encapsulating the freewheeling spirit of the times and the divide between the youth culture and the Establishment. Nicholson became a bona-fide star playing football-helmeted, hard-partying lawyer George Hanson, for which he earned a Best Supporting Actor nod, while Hopper and Fonda merely amped up their reputations as iconoclasts. Along with its pulsating rock soundtrack, \\"Rider\\" endures as the ultimate psychedelic road-trip.
B000QFAJ7S|1.0|Kelly is ruining her voice and she is not a song writer.  Really bad but it will do well with her fans buying multiple copies.
B000NJMJGG|5.0|Willow is one of my favorite movies.  Willow loves his family, friends and community.  He tries hard to please all of them!  Val Kilmer did a great job in this movie.  His character is a rough, tough guy who tries to hide his good heart.  There's lots to like in this movie---comedy, adventure, battles, fantasy, even monsters!  It's the kind of movie my husband and I love to watch --more than once.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|This is probabily the second best film in the world-next to Pocahontas that is. The songs are all really catchy and the animation is spectacular.

0143038419|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The author made it so easy to share and understand the many phases a woman has in her life.  I could relate to this woman and felt that she looked inside me and shared many thoughts and emotions that I have had.
1594489505|2.0|Sad to say but this was a poor follow up book to the Kite Runner.  It must be hard to write a second book after the first mega hit but rehashing ideas doesn't work.  Should it be read for the value of learning more about the Muslim culture and human suffering at the hands of the Taliban, absolutely, but had I know, I would have waited for the paper back version.
B000MRAAJW|1.0|Not one but two shipments of this DVD collection will not play on ANY player.  High Definition or otherwise.

B000GFLE86|4.0|Madeleine Peyroux stands out among current jazz singers - the comparisons to Lady Day are inevitable and appropriate. But, to say the obvious, Ms. Holiday has been gone a long time, and it's high time a talented singer picked up something of her approach and ran with it. I'd say Madeleine Peyroux is as good as any to handle this golden baton.     On Half the Perfect World Madeleine Peyroux takes possession of the melodic, pocket true style of jazz singing that I prefer. It's a style that 'sells the song' exquisitely, and the result is a record that is true to jazz but also quite approachable.    It's excellent; I reserve the fifth star for groundbreaking work, and I don't think this one qualifies as pioneering. I'm sure I'll play it often and for a long time, and I look forward to following Ms. Peyroux's work in the future.
0451197879|2.0|It's hard for me to give any King book less than 4 stars, but this just wasn't my kind of novel. I think he was trying to show us the inner battle inside this troubled character, but it just wasn't something I could get into. I just couldn't wait to hurry up and finish it. It's not poor writing (again, LOVE STEPHEN KING) but I would recommend dozens of his other books before I would recommend this one.   If you're looking for a phenomenal Stephen King novel, I would strongly recommend \\"IT.\\"
B00005MP58|5.0|This is a fine collection - after all these years I have finally read the book, chased up the film - and loved it for the most part although I thought Elizabeth a bit 'modern' for my tastes. So I had to get the much talked about BBC production. At  first I thought Firth (Darcy) almost too remote - but oddly, by the end, was quite moved by the reconciliation of the two main protagonists. An elegant production. Some fine work by the cast, excepting Mrs Bennett who irritated me in a way that wasn't quite as Austen intended. The 'extras' (bios etc) were a little thin on the ground but the whole presentation couldn't be faulted. An excellent buy and well worth having in one's possession. And far from expensive!
B000KRNCYY|5.0|Celtic Woman, A New Journey  From Start to finish it was a joy, The setting the Music the arrangement the presention. All were perfect.    A real joy to watch, listen and enjoy!
B0006A9FKA|4.0|I was never a huge fan of Zombie flicks.  George Romero's Night Of The Living Dead scared me so bad when I was eight years old that I didn't sleep for the next decade.  So when it comes to the lurching, head-snacking undead, I tend to steer the other way.  Well, too many of my friends have commented on Shaun Of The Dead, so I had to take a look for myself.  I'm a big fan of dry British humor and Shaun Of The Dead is packed with that as well as flesh-scarfing zombies.  The entire scene where Shaun goes to the liquor store to by his morning drink and completely ignores all the signs (the bloody handprints on the glass of the cooler door, the dead bodies sprawled in the yards and streets) that the zombies have come to roost.  Hysterical!  Along with his slacker cohort Ed, Shaun decides to go over to his mum's house and rescue her, while taking care of his zombie-bitten step-father with a cricket bat.  The laughs, entertwined with the gore, make for one trippy movie.  Filled with absurd situations, Shaun Of The Dead will have you rolling while you flinch.  Great!<br /><br />Dig it!
0450040186|5.0|Though I think THE SHINING is one of the scariest movies made of Stephen King's books, the novel is even better! There's something very horrifying about watching a human being going crazy on his family...and this book brings it to life. Of course, there's a few ghosts to help along the way!It's a King classic.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|Beautifully filmed and narrated; very informative and entertaining.  This DVD set is definitely worth the cost.
1582701709|5.0|The book and the pages of the book are beautiful. It is a very delightful piece to place on a coffee table for guests to pick up and read. The contents, though presented in a very different manner, are very similar to Esther and Jerry Hicks Law of Attraction which is channeled through Esther from Abraham. For me the contents were not new.
B000ICL3KG|3.0|Mr. Gore does an excellent job of explaining the warming crisis.  However, I found the overall movie to be dry and reminded me of a workplace slide presentation.  The movie could have been much improved with more visits to locations where the problem is most obvious, and interviews with scientists and climatologists to add their personal observations.  Overall, worth viewing but somewhat disappointing.
B000HIVO64|4.0|I've been a fan of Beck's music since his debut with 'Odelay'. If there's music that can stand out from the crowd it is this. Beck packs in a tight punch with great guitar riffs to his songs. His creativity for blending different generes of music is his greatest asset with a voice to die for. The Information continues showcasing Beck's amazing music deliverance , you won't stop stomping your feet with this album for sure.<br /><br />The information , and some songs from all of Beck's previous album would make a great soundtrack to the Ocean's 11 , 12 , 13 Triology. It fit's right in with the movie and you'll be asking for more of this class and style of music.
B000HIVOI2|5.0|The only complaint I've found is that there's no subtitles for the Alien language without turning on subtitles for the whole movie. There is a second English subtitle option that just has the alien language. It wasn't in the menu itself because it's supposed to play automatically, but if you just use the subtitle button on your remote it comes up. Took a whole two minutes to find.
0440419514|5.0|While I had already read the entire trilogy, upon re-reading it I realized it was so worth it. The writing is impeccable, Pullman really knows how to tug at one's mindstrings. Although, definately NOT for those who struggle to look outside the box. Also, I would be slow to reccomend this book to someone that is very religious and won't appriciate reading a story about a land that could or could not be real. Overall, simply enthralling and wonderful.
B0002WZTPC|5.0|A classic!!!  Everyone should own a copy of this movie in their home entertainment collections.
0743201140|4.0|This book was very well written. I agree totally that a lot of the time we spend too much time on our weaknesses. I did not give it 5 stars because I think it downplayed weaknesses too much. Although we should not spend too much time on weaknesses, we should have a plan to strive to improve them especially if they are affecting our performance on the job. I think the biggest issue with most is that many people are in jobs that don't line up with their strengths. I am going to have my teenage son take the survey to be able to pin point his strenghts. Hopefully he can find a job fomr the beginning of his career that fits with his stengths. Overall the book was very helpful. I purchased one of each of my staff.
0446310786|3.0|Well, because this is a \\"classic\\", I will not bore anyone with details of the story within.    But, I do have a few things to say about this book. The first is that To Kill a Mockingbird is very well written. It holds your attention even at the lowest points in the book. It keeps you hungry for what is to come.    The second thing is that the actual story is terribly dull. While the writing keeps you going looking for what is going to happen, the story refuses to let anything happen. I can see where people could find action, but to me it is weak. After I finished the book, only then did I realize how pointless the whole experience was.     It was like riding a roller coaster, but not a usual roller coaster. You patiently wait for the chain to pull you to the top of the slope (chain=writing in this metaphor). Then when you get to the top the ride is over and everyone gets out (story=depressing end to ride). You realize that there was no point to going up the hill. The ride was a waste of time. Sure, there were some neat sights to see from that height (interesting sights=minor interesting action), but who needs the sights when I wanted a ride?    I just wonder why this book is a classic.
B000002GB9|5.0|This is the release that launched Styx into commercial stardom that would give them years of top 40 hits and would lead to tensions in the band between founding member Dennis DeYoung and 6th album newcomer Tommy Shaw.  With very minor hits on their previous album 'Equinox' the single 'Lady' from their second album comes into airtime and then this album bursts onto the scene and the rest is history.  There isn't a bad song on this album and the trademark Shaw / Young songs that really started here is perfect.  If you're looking for a classic rock album with progressive, rock, and a little theater thrown in then get this today.  It might be commercial, but Styx was still able to keep their originality alive without succumbing to the corporate label.  That would come later.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|One thing I've noticed with all Dream Theater reviews save a couple (which you'll find out which after you read this sentence): all the critical fans whine because it's not another \\"Images & Words\\" or perhaps \\"Metropolis Part 2: Scenes From a Memory\\".  Both were good albums but while these fans proclaim to not want monotony they also criticize the albums for not being like them, which is something I, at least personally, find a bit contradictory.  <br />  <br />I don't know if I'd call myself a Dream Theater album.  This was actually the second album of theirs I bought after \\"Imges & Words\\" but even to this day I still listen to it and with gusto.  Even the lyrics are impressive for the most part.  \\"Face yourself, man/Brace yourself and trace your hell back!\\"  <br />  <br />This album is one of their heavier albums, probably even the heaviest of all of them (though I haven't heard all of them yet, including the new album).  If you like a more metal sound you'll like this.  It may be more \\"straight up\\" or \\"direct\\" than their previous albums but it still has its \\"prog-ness\\" to it.  There's not many soft songs on here except \\"Vacant\\", which is short.  Other than that, the only real softness is on parts of \\"Endless Sacrifice\\" and \\"In The Name of God\\", and I say part because a lot of those songs have heavy parts too.  <br />  <br />It's probably safe to say there's not as much of that typical synthesizer, organ-like keyboard work, if you know what I mean, and a lot more distortion.  However, Jordan does some really astounding keyboard work with a distorted, guitar-like keyboard sound.  If you're not familiar to this type of keyboarding, you'll probably think it's a guitar, like I did, but really it's just Jordan kicking a**.  Seriously, great stuff.  The rest of the instruments and vocals are great too.  My favorites as of now are \\"Endless Sacrifice\\" because of that really great instrumental section which in my opinion has two of the best guitar solos John as ever playedas well as one of the best dual solos Jordan and John have ever played; and \\"In The Name of God\\" because it has that \\"epic\\" feel I wish I could hear more of (in metal in general).  The closing part where James goes, \\"In the name of Gah-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahd/In the name of Gah-ah-aaaaahd!\\" is powerful and soaring and one of the best vocal lines I've ever heard from them and is the best part of the song.  I find myself rewinding and listening to that part over and over because it gets me so hard.  <br />  <br />Well, anyway, this is a heavy Dream Theater album with a lot of good stuff.  It's not a repeat of \\"Images & Words\\" and \\"Metropolis Part 2: Scenes From a Memory\\" so spare me the tears.  I don't know if it's better than their earlier albums, which have a lot to do with personal preference as Dream Theater generally releases quality albums and there's so much to examine in all of them.  However, I think it's one of Dream Theater's better albums and definitely worth the buy.  It may not be perfect but that doesn't mean it's worth the unfair, crap rating people are giving it.
B00005JPHT|5.0|Sicko exposes a massive scheme perpetrated by the health insurance corporations and the pro-corporate government to defraud the American people.  Michael Moore uses sarcastic humor to make his point that the system that was setup by the corporations and the government deliberately keeps the American people uneducated, misinformed, and in fear of getting sick.  He also exposes how this fraud came about and how both the Republicans and the Democrats keep it in place.  Everyone should watch this movie, especial the ones who have insurance since this movie is about them.
B00005JPQT|5.0|I have to say that I am a huge fan of the Die Hard franchise. The series is by far my favorite action movies I have ever seen. I also consider the original Die Hard to be my favorite movie of all time.    But onto \\"Live Free or Die Hard.\\" I had mixed feelings going into this movie, mainly due to Len Wiseman (who made those mediocre-at-best Underworld movies) being the director and the PG-13 rating. I thought it was ridiculous having a Die Hard movie being PG-13, since all the rest of them were rated R......  So I went into that theatre, sat down, and indulged myself in this 2+ hour a$$-kicker that i feel is an excellent addition to the franchise....  First of all, this movie had a bit of Nostalgia to it. John McClane is the same smart-mouthed, tough guy as he was in all of the other movies. We get to see him talk to himself in humorous ways like before, most notably the first Die Hard. The overall feel to the city with John and Matt driving around and helicopters hovering above reminded me of Die Hard with a Vengeance.  Some of the original Die Hard background music also returns, which I thought added to the overall intensity of certain situations.  The action is still the same, even though its a bit more ridiculous this time around. The high body count and huge explosions are still there. The stunts are definitely worth noting. I caught myself with my jaw wide open as I saw some of the things they were doing. I was very glad they didn't overuse CGI effects like most other movies do nowadays.   The only things I didn't really care for about this movie was Olyphant playing the main bad guy and Justin Long playing John's hacking sidekick. Matt was much more forgivable though since he was pretty much needed by John to get around the computer-based world that is today. But my attention was so focused on Bruce Willis that I didn't really even care.    Overall, I was astonished by how good of a movie this was. It's nice to see a sequel that pretty much stays true to the franchise name (which not many fourth-rounder movies can say.) There is tons of violence and wisecracks, and you'll barely even notice that this movie was rated PG-13. If you are a big Die Hard fan like I am, I'm pretty sure you'll like this movie just as much as I did...and that's alot.    Yippee Ki Yay...........you know the rest.
B00005R24G|5.0|I wish I could say I hated this movie. Then I could easily endure the ridiculous price the individual people are trying to get for this DVD. I check this title regular in the hope the studio has re-released it so I can buy it for a decent price. Although this movie has been one of my all time favorites since I first saw it at the theater, there is no way I would ever pay over twenty-five dollars for a DVD. Quite honestly anyone that charges more than that is just greedy.<br /><br />The movie starring Michael Caine and Lawrence Olivier centers around them in Olivier's house for most the movie. The lies, tricks, and traps they do on one another are amazing and will keep you guessing when they are being truthful and when they are not. Two men, mano a mano, using their wits and anything else not tacked down to dispose of the other. If you enjoyed \\"Deathtrap\\" you should love \\"Sleuth\\".
1573225517|4.0|Allow me to clarify the above statement. I had read Nick Hornby's A Long Way Down, at the recommendation of a friend. I loved it and definitely feel the sense that I could read it over again at some point. High Fidelity, on the other hand, while a very well written book, with funny moments, very real characters, and a good story, just isn't the same for me. I liked it a lot, but I didn't love it, and most likely would not pick it up again.      And as I sit here I can't help but wonder if it's because I'm not that into music and obviously the main character, his life, and a large bulk of the story revolve around it. I realize there are relationships, real life thoughts, fears, and moments, and that's what I enjoyed and took from this book. However, I couldn't help but think that if these were sports references and not musical ones, I'd be much more interested in the details.    Despite all that, I was interested in the story. It was a quick read, and like the other Hornby book I read, filled with some funny moments, some poignant thoughts about life, and a strong dose of reality. I appreciate all of that. My favorite part of the book, probably, was the interaction between Rob and Barry's characters. Their exchanges were sharp and funny. The record shop, itself a big character, and all the other odd characters that found their way there, were equally enjoyable. I also must admit that I liked the top five lists, despite my not knowing many of the musicians on them.    Overall, I give High Fidelity four stars because I really do appreciate most of what the book was about and the overall journey of reading it. I just find that I liked A Long Way Down much better.
1594489505|5.0|This book is a masterpiece that will have far reaching effects on the way women are treated. This isn't a book you just read: it's a book you experience. I knew women were treated like property in parts of the world but knowing it and experiencing it with these characters is vastly different. I am grateful to Khaled Hosseini for expanding my compassion.<br />I have never had such a deep emotional reaction to a book.

B000JJRIN4|5.0|it's much more adventurous, complex, eclectic, interesting than LAMB -- LAMB was more standard pop.
B000OCXMAE|3.0|It's pretty good. I wouldn't say it's my favorite CD of their's though. I am a little disapointed with it, but it's not bad. I wish some of the songs were faster, so it's not good driving music. But, like I said before, it's not a bad CD.  I also wish that they wouldn't swear in it, like they don't in the other two CD's, but maybe that's just my opinion.
1594489505|5.0|This is a fantastic book. I might even say better than Kite Runner. The story  pulls at your heart, and keeps you turning page after page. I highly recommend this book!
B00003CXXP|4.0|This film will surely hold up well historically.  In 2099 when the reviewers are doing their \\"most influential films of the century\\" reflections I'm sure this will be on many lists.  Both Kubrick and Speilberg annointed this film with their own special genius.  It's an uncomplicated remake of any \\"I want to be a real boy\\" story filtered through very complicated visualizations.
B000PKG6TE|2.0|For the past 10 years or so, the Queens have consistently released some of the best rock music to be found anywhere.  Though invariably loud and abrasive, their songs ranged from the eerie and ominous to tightly structured pop classics that were never derivative.  Coupled with decent lyrics and great musicianship, they stood distinctly apart from and far above their peers.  Unfortunately, none of this is evident on the new release.  The songs meander and are reminiscent, to me at least, of a style personified by the Greatful Dead...much harder, of course, but just as uninspiring.   Sick, sick, sick a supposed standout here, reminds me of another clunker of theirs, the repetitive and just plain stupid song, Feelgood Hit of the Summer (an anthem for brain dead meatheads).  Every good band delivers a clunker on occasion and they have risen (or stumbled?) to the occasion on this CD.  P.S.  After repeated listenings, it gets much worse.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is my favorite version of P&P.  I am a true Jane Austen fan, and having read P&P, Colin Firth is Mr. Darcy through and through.  Elizabeth is perfect as well.  Mrs. Bennett's performance is outstanding.  Great price through Amazon!!!  Highly recommend.
0064430227|5.0|I wasn't too sure if my Kindergarten students would enjoy this story, but they were very excited about it. They were totally engaged in every page. It's a great book for teaching sequencing. I followed up the story by having each child draw in purple crayon only, their adventure. Instead of \\"Harold and the Purple Crayon\\" they put their name in the title. It gave them an opportunity to use their imagination, just as Harold had done. This 50th Anniversary story has stood the test of time.

0345494768|5.0|Being a child of the 70's, Star Wars pretty much WAS my childhood. And my imagination would fill in all the blanks about things I wondered most about. Like, what did the Stormtroopers look like without their helmets? Who played Greedo? Was there really a full sized Sand Crawler?    Then as a teen, I became interested in filmmaking, and wanted to know all about the behind the scene trickery and special effects. Where did the TIE fighter sound come from? How big was the Star Destroyer model? How did they blow up the ships?    Every one of these questions are answered in full color (and sometimes black & white) glory. Shots of sideburned actors hanging out without their Trooper helmets (WOW!! Had I seen THAT as kid...), an actress using a clothespin to make Greedo appear to speak, and more model shop pictures than you can shake a Ghaffi stick at. Not to mention amazingly detailed personal stories of the hardships of shooting a weird science fiction flick in strange foreign countries for the same budget that probably barely bought a week's meals for the Spiderman III crew.    Very, very pleased with this huge book. It's literally overwhelming, with page after page of secrets finally revealed.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|So Kelly Clarkson's third studio album leaked a few days back and, having now gotten my hands on the shiny copy when it was released in Ireland last Friday, life couldn't be better.    To say that My December is one of the most hotly-anticipated releases of 2007 would be a huge understatement, and I am delighted to report that it is totally worth the wait. Amid all the media frenzy surrounding Clarkson's struggle to have the record she's proud of released as is, it could be very easy to forget that this is an artist with no shortage of hit singles under her belt. Perhaps, even easier to overlook, is the fact that she wrote on several of them. It's such a pity then, that she has been met with so much resistance from her label, the result only being a ridiculous delay in the release date. Enough about that though, there is the matter of 14 tracks to discuss...    Firstly, I'm going to get the bad out of the way.  There are two tracks, namely 'One Minute' and 'Yeah', that have taken their time growing on me.  It's probably half my own fault since my first experience of this cd wasn't a proper copy, but the leaked download a while prior to release.  Since buying the cd a few days ago though, I have gained a new appreciation for the tracks, especially 'Yeah', the funky guitar playing just totally winning me over.  'One Minute' has also proven it possesses the ever-yearned for quality of growing on you and never letting go.  It's a sign of the quality on this record that these two are the ones I class as the 'bad' tracks, especially since I no longer skip ANY of them.    Now on to the good, or should that be great, stuff...    'Never Again', the lead single is a wonderfully bitter and anthemic number. It doesn't possess the instant hook of 'Since U Been Gone', but lyrically (like the rest of the album) it's head and shoulders above most of Clarkson's previous work (I say 'most' because of an extraordinary track on Breakaway entitled 'Addicted'). Think Alanis Morissette 'Jagged Little Pill' meets Pat Benatar and you might get some idea of what this stomping, roaring, track is all about.    'Hole' is one that has grown on me with repeated listens. It's a fab indie-rock sounding number, with clashing guitars and superb vocals. There aren't many in the industry today who can belt out a track like this while injecting emotion into it, but Clarkson is one of them. Not great single potential in my opinion, but a cool little track nonetheless.    'Sober' for me is the stand-out track on 'My December'. Quietly released to radio a week or so ago, it is a chilling ballad that slowly builds from a whisper to a roar. If your spine doesn't tingle when she finally hits the high note, you might want to check your pulse. Unfortunately it seems this beautiful track may be lost amid the dirge of mainstream pop radio, but that in no way diminishes it. It is far superior to any of the big ballads on the Top 40 right now, too bad most radio stations won't give it the airplay it demands.    'Don't Waste Your Time' is possibly the closest thing to a track off 'Breakaway' that you're going to hear on 'My December'. It's a great little track that is destined to be blasted from your car stereo during the (hopefully) sunny summer days.    'Judas' is a fantastically dark number, with a killer beat and a great chorus. I liked this one from the second listen, its title somewhat suggestive of an acoustic track, throwing me the first time.    'Haunted' is the 'Evanescence-like' number on the record, though beyond the production on the opening riff, I fail to draw any parallels. Clarkson's vocal soars to heights Amy Lee could only dream about, and I'm an 'Evanescence' fan. This is both beautiful and heart-breaking when one considers the subject matter (a friend's suicide), every note laden with grief, and I feel it could work very well as a single. It has a strong and definite chorus, but maybe more suited to an Autumn release - the tone a little depressing for thecurrent season.    'Be Still' provides a welcome rest from the tracks that came before. It is a lovely slow-tempo ballad that allows Clarkson's voice to shine.    'Maybe' is possibly Clarkson at her best lyrically. Her vocal guides us, accompanied by an acoustic guitar, through and when the drums finally kick in, the effect is utterly breath-taking.    'How I Feel' is one of my favourites on the album. It's a fun and funky track which, in my opinion, should have been the lead single. The lyrics are fun and quirky, the verses bouncy and the chorus extremely catchy. The perfect summer track. Oh well...    'Can I Have A Kiss' has been described by Clarkson as the dark horse of the album. You know, that one track that isn't supposed to be a single, that everyone ends up falling in love with? Well she's right. I was hesitant to love it at first, but upon repeat listens it's really grown on me, gotten under my skin, and is now one of my favourites. Don't be surprised if this is announced as a single.    'Irvine' is beautiful. There are very few words one can muster to describe it, it's THAT good. Here we find Clarkson at her lowest (reportedly written in the bathroom after a show at the titular venue during her summer '06 tour) and most vulnerable. Her vocal, accompanied by a single guitar, is amazing - one might only hope for an entire record of such tracks one day. An album gem.    'Chivas' is the hidden track (about a minute after 'Irvine') and is a wonderful little kiss-off to an ex. Clarkson chuckles her way through, channeling Janis Joplin as she chooses scotch over the offending party. 'I love you...Chivas' Superb!    It goes without saying that I like this album. It shows incredible growth artistically and is one of those rareities - a great pop record. Sure the sell-outs are dominating the singles charts and Top40 Radio right now, but I for one am far more interested in an artist who refuses to compromise and continues to show why she's a force to be reckoned with. This is a complete record, it flows and tells a story and takes you on an emotional journey. Not a 'Hey Hey You You!' in sight. And if that's not what constitutes great music then I don't know what does!    Go out and buy this and make up your own mind though. You won't be disappointed.  Now, I'm off to fling my copy of 'Best Damn Thing' (bought in a fit of lunacy I swear) under the nearest passing truck...

B000MNP2KI|4.0|When I first heard there was a new Bond, I wasn't sure. He pulls off the character very well and the action scenes are great. In comparison to the other Bond movies, it was just kinda okay for me. Sean connery and Pierce Brosnon were my favorites. It didn't hold my attention like the other bond movies did, but was worth watching for the gadgets, hot chicks, and of course, bond kicking a....can we say that? kicking butt.

B000QFAJ7S|5.0|4 ½ stars<br /><br />Kelly Clarkson's latest album \\"my december\\" blazes along with creative assurance and she's never sounded so good vocally. As most of you have read by now, the majority of the songs are about anger and sorrow, but there's optimism as well.<br /><br />I can't believe Clive Davis sat on this album for months (making fans wait) because it lacked \\"hit songs,\\" well, all I can say is thanks Kelly for sticking to your guns. It's a really good album! I'm not sure there are \\"hit singles\\" here, but that's a good thing. There's an intensity here that may be a little too dark and volatile for some, but there's also gorgeous goose bump moments, and catchy sing along chorus' as well.<br /><br />Three is truly a charm for Ms. Clarkson. Thanks Kelly, for not taking the $10,000,000 bribe.<br /><br />ps - Let me blow you a kiss!
1582701709|5.0|The Secret has been scorned and has been hailed. What it really is, is a positive thinking manifesto and an introduction to the masters--from Emerson to Napolean Hill.  Stuart Wilde to Norman Vincent Peale.  I hope that people will read this and begin to expand their horizons and see that life is full of possibillity.
B000NDIAWY|4.0|I can't stop listening to this!!  The first few tracks are unbelievable and the rest of the cd is pretty darn good too.  In addition to the title track, favorite songs include:  Turpentine and Wasted.  Brandi's voice is beautiful, rich and true.  Just one warning, if you're considering buying this disc, at times this music has a country-ish vibe to it...so if you're not down with that, this might not be for you.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|As a fan of Loreen's since The Visit, I have enjoyed her journey into her Celtic Roots and exploration of World Music. An Ancient Muse does not disappoint. From the beginning chords of Incantation through the Haunting chords of the Never Ending Road, I feel like I tagged along with Loreena on her journey through self discovery and her beloved musical Celtic roots.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|\\"Casino Royale\\" is an exceptional reboot of the James Bond franchise.<br /><br />After 20 successful Bond films starring five actors in the title role, Daniel Craig takes over in a film that takes place at the very start of his career as a 00 agent. M, played by the masterful Judi Dench, hands him his promotion and his fabled \\"licence to kill\\" after a pre-credits mission to collar an MI6 turncoat; the action after the credits are apparently the new Bond's first adventure as 007.<br /><br />It begins with what must be one of the most amazing foot chases in movie history. By the end of that pulse-pounding scene, you'll be ready to acknowledge Craig as a fitting (and admirably fit) Bond. (For anyone who might confuse this film with the 1967 Bond spoof, they're similar in nothing but name.)<br /><br />Let's cut to the chase: Craig is Bond. But he's not reprising Connery, Brosnan or even Roger Moore; this Bond is entirely new, built from the ground up for a new generation of fans. He's edgier, more physical, without using gadgets and gimmickry as a crutch. This Bond is raw and unpolished, reinventing himself as a 00 agent as he goes, developing the character's notorious emotional detachment and ruthless sense of duty as we watch.<br /><br />And if you don't believe a card game can make for a tense movie experience, you haven't seen this film. But there's more than just cards: Casino Royale has its share of car wrecks, explosions, gun fights, seductions, exotic settings, chases and buildings collapsing into the Grand Canal. Just watch it and let this Bond win you over.<br /><br />by Tom Knapp, Rambles.(n e t) editor
0743289684|5.0|Brave woman, incredible story and great insight into the third world culture in Islamic countries. Ayaan's book is very timely, with the war in Iraq and Afganistan and understanding the clash of our culture with theirs. I applaud Ayaan for her amazing courage to step away from all she was brought up with. She deserves all the support we can give her and I hope she finds happiness and peace in this country.
0385495323|4.0|An entertaining and informative book about the history of codes by Simon Singh, an English physicist of Indian descent who had previously written a very good tome about Fermat's last theorem. Highlights of the book are discussions of the Enigma machine and its decipherement during World War II by Marian Rejewski and Alan Turing, the decipherement of the ancient greek alphabet called Lineal B (not strictly a secret code, but a fascinating story nonetheless) and the more modern developements of public key and quantum cryptography (the latter one, still in development, promises the long sought dream of an unbreakable code). The book does not presuppose previous mathematical knowledge, though the later chapters do require some intense concentration on the part on the reader.
B000068TPN|5.0|We were soldiers is my favorite war movie, and that says something because it had to beat out Braveheart, Glory, Gettysburg, BlackHawk Down, WindTalkers and the Great Raid. What makes it so special is the courage and character of Hal Moore. I read the book, and the movie is very accurate. It also teaches me the history of the Vietnam war through the eyes of someone who is not trying to tear this country down. Best movie made about Vietnam by far.
B000OMD4BG|4.0|I lived in Portland Oregon in the mid 1990's and some of my best memories are the Elliot Smith shows i saw in quaint local bars and clubs, up close and personal, just Elliot and his guitar. I always loved him with his band as well, but to me, the true artist in Elliot Smith always came shining through in his solo shows, when his fantastic songwriting was front and center.    If you are the kind of person who owns every Elliot Smith CD, and considers the Kill Rock Stars records to be his best, then New Moon is a must have. There is no need for me to go through track by track to describe the beauty of this album. The care that went into this release by the people who put it together deserves five stars in itself.    Listening to New Moon made me realize how great Elliot Smith was and how much i miss hearing him and seeing him create new music.
1416524800|4.0|On the Milne Ice Shelf north of the Arctic Circle, a NASA team works to retrieve a huge, heat-scarred rock from deep in the ancient ice. It's been there, according to their tests, since falling out of the sky in the early 18th Century. An asteroid that was part of a fall known to recorded history, it would be interesting anyway; but this asteroid, the tests also indicate, is special. No, make that extraordinary, because this asteroid contains fossils. Proof, NASA and the supportive administration of U.S. President Zach Herney both believe, that extraterrestrial life existed in the far past, and therefore can be presumed to exist now. The President personally asks Rachel Sexton, who's employed by the National Reconnaisance Office (a CIA-like security agency), to travel to the Milne Ice Shelf, evaluate the situation, and then announce the asteroid's recovery and its implications to his White House staff. Rachel happens to be the daughter of Herney's opponent in the upcoming election, a corrupt and cynical but nevertheless dangerously popular U.S. senator. That makes her evaluation of NASA's discovery about as unbiased as it can get, and that's what the president needs to convince his staff that his support for NASA - after its long succession of failures and cost overruns - won't be a liability on election day. Rachel Sexton knows her father better than anyone else, and despises him. Although she's initially reluctant to do as the president requests, she's soon caught up in the thrill shared by NASA staff members on site at Milne; and by several civilian scientists, including popular documentary maker Michael Tolland, who are there to film the discovery on behalf of both NASA and the Herney Administration.<br /><br />That's how the book begins, after a creepy prologue that foreshadows the trouble Rachel Sexton and Michael Tolland are unwittingly getting themselves into. They soon find themselves fleeing for their lives across the frigid northern ocean, with mysterious military (or perhaps quasi-military?) operatives trying to prevent them from communicating to anyone else the secret they've learned. From that point on the action doesn't stop. Brown's prose is awkward at times (a different editor than usual, perhaps?), but that's a minor annoyance. The author follows his own usual formula for writing successful thrillers, including the \\"twist\\" ending that you may see coming anyhow if you've read several of his other books, but it's a heck of a ride all the same. Rachel Sexton \\"works\\" as a character in ways Brown's other heroines haven't; and for this reader, that's a huge plus. Loads of fun!y (or perhaps quasi-military?) operatives trying to prevent them from communicating to anyone else the secret they've learned. From that point on the action doesn't stop.

B000NVIXDW|5.0|I have loved Michael Bublé since the first time I heard him. (And he's absolutely amazing in concert!) And with this album he just proves why every female in the world should be listening to him. He sings these songs so sexy and with his own great personality that even the old favorites can become new hits again. \\"Your Man\\" is exactly what every woman wants her man to say... better yet, sing to her like Bublé - that would be perfect. \\"Everything\\" is so catchy and fun that even my 3-year-old son loves it. \\"It Had Better Be Tonight\\", with it's salsa sound, makes you want to dance. \\"Lost\\" and \\"Comin' Home\\" are songs that make you feel like he's singing to you. He has such emotion in his songs that you can't help but feel good when listening to them. If you don't have any Bublé music... shame on you... but this is a great place to start! Once you're hooked, you can't help but collect everything he sings. To be so young and to have such a sexy voice with the old-school feel... what's not to love?! This is the music today's kids should be listening to and the type of singer they should be looking up to.
1934451320|5.0|One of the best and finest books I have read since the Bible.  An excellent follow up to the book called \\"The Secret\\"
0452287588|5.0|This book is amazing.  I feel like this book brings to light a new logic to life.  He portrays spiritual wisdom in a new light.  No church, no higher power, only the full acceptance of your emotions and how you feel right now.  Definately a good read.
0143038419|2.0|I agree with the reviewers who said that Gilbert's writing is \\"dishonest\\" - it's as if she deliberately dumbed down her experiences in order to make Oprah's book list and to sell a lot of copies of this marginally written shallow book.   <br />Even her experience in Italy is sort of depressing. THAT is hedonistic pleasure and re-awakening? Her life before her journey appears to be identical to her life during the jouurney- being paid to travel and write about it in a way that appeals to the masses - essentially saying nothing at all.  And how are any of her actions or beliefs spiritual? She is more self-obsessed than a teenager and I was sad and embarrased for her.  <br />I should have been scared off when I saw it was a best-seller. It's not entirely awful because it's amusing in places but ultimately not worth it.
B000002U8G|5.0|Back in the days of vinyl I loved echoes but hadn't really connected with side one. Too acoustic. Too silly. And except for track one, too mellow. Now decades later I'm rediscovering Meddle. It's a lot better than I remember. Tuneful and melodious. Varied and interesting. Highly recommended here not for its role in the Pink Floyd cannon, but rather for the lasting quality of its songs.
B0000CFW87|5.0|A wonderful music CD with one of the best voices in the world today.The bonus \\"you raise me up\\"makes it a must have CD.

B000MRAAJM|4.0|I have been a nature documentary fan my whole life.  Planet Earth is by far the most mind blowing series to date.  They have set the new standard for nature shows.  The American versions with Sigourney Weaver are beautiful, but the naration is rather boring and un-eventful.  This Blu-Ray/DVD release has the original David Attenborough narration which is truly inspiring.  My only complaint is that this Blu-Ray set doesn't have any extras!  No commentary or \\"Making of Planet Earth\\".  They really dropped the ball here.

B000NDIAWY|5.0|Have you ever bought a CD for one song? Were you pleasantly surprised to discover maybe 1 or 2 other tracks that you actually liked? \\"The Story\\" will give you a full CD to love from start to finish.  Although slightly shrill at times, it doesn't offend the ear, somehow it adds to the sentiment she is trying to convey.  I hate to compare her to other artists, I find her style and sound to be quite unique.  I'm a huge fan of her debut CD and am pleased that this sophomore release is of equal caliber.  A great addition to your collection, really a timeless CD.
1594489505|5.0|LOVED this book...I read the Kite Runner last summer and was so moved by it.  I then saw the film (at a special screening) and continued to be inspired by Hosseini's work.  His new novel takes a look at the women of Afghanistan...very real and tough to read at some points.  I recommend reading both Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns.  Quick reads and stay with you.
B00005JPQT|5.0|\\"[[ASIN:B0002B15WE Die Hard]]\\" was ranked as the greatest action movie ever made by \\"Entertainment Weekly\\" last week and the 1988 film remains an important touchstone for a lot of what has followed in its wake (e.g., \\"[[ASIN:B0006GANOQ Speed]]\\" was sold as \\"'Die Hard' on a bus\\").  It has been a dozen years since the third time Bruce Willis has played John McClane, mainly because it took a decade to come up with a story and script that would justify the return.  I expected the wait would be worth it because Willis obviously has been holding out for something worthwhile, just like Spielberg, Lucas, Harrison et al. have been taking their time getting around to a fourth Indiana Jones movie.  So, here I am back from the theater where my wife informed me during the end credits, \\"This was a good movie.\\"<br /><br />I would say it was a very good movie.  Not as great as the original, but according to \\"EW\\" no action movie is, so that is hardly a damning comment.  John McClane is still a detective with the NYPD and still divorced, whose current personal headache is that his daughter, Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is not speaking to him, or calling him dad for that matter.  Then the FBI cyber-crime department gets hacked and McClane gets a call to pick up a local hacker and brining him to Washington, D.C. for questioning.  The only problem is that McClane arrives at the apartment of Matt Farrell (Justin Long) just ahead of a bunch of guys with big guns.  Somebody wants Farrell dead and it clearly has something to do with the cyber-terrorists who are starting to take down the nation's infrastructure one computer controlled support at a time.  Farrell knows about \\"mutating algorithmic security codes,\\" \\"fire sales,\\" and how to use a laptop to control down the world.  McClane knows how to take down a helicopter without bullets.<br /><br />Len Wiseman, director of \\"[[ASIN:B0001WTUH6 Underworld]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B000F6IOC0 Underworld - Evolution]],\\" directs the fun that came from merging Roderick Thorp \\"certain original characters,\\" namely John McClane and his grown up daughter Lucy, with John Carlin's article \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" (you can find it on the Internet).  Carlin wrote all about the \\"soft-destruction\\" that can result from an \\"I-war,\\" a term that refers not to an Internet War but rather an Infrastructure War.  But this is a \\"Die Hard\\" movie and that means whatever people might be thinking or saying about what is going on, it always comes down to the same thing in the end. That, of course, is but one of the key elements in a \\"Die Hard\\" movie, the others being that the situation ends up being personal, improvising ways of getting out of sticky situations alive, receiving help from unlikely stories, and having to save the day because nobody else is in a position to do it.  All that plus bleeding a lot.<br /><br />There are all sort of little in-jokes with regards to the previous files (take a wild guess what it the name of the FBI agent McClane runs into) and well as obvious homages (e.g., fireballs in the elevator), and even if you have not see any of the previous three films recently you will still recall enough to get a lot of the self-reflexive moments.  I am surprised that Timothy Olyphant is not quite as intense as he was on \\"[[ASIN:B0006FO5LO Deadwood]]\\" as the villain, and Kevin Smith actually shows up without his glasses in an interesting role, but it is Long whose character is smart enough to do the right think sooner rather than later and Winstead who proves she is daddy's little girl who stand out in support of Willis.<br /><br />However, we all know that ultimate an action movie comes down to the stunts, especially now that CGI is available to up the ante.  The gold standard is from the original movie when the roof is about to explode at Nakatomi Plaza and McClane wraps a firehose around his waist and jumps off.  This was pretty damn exciting in 1988 and as I recall the scene was THE clip they showed from the movie (stopping when McClane landed in the room and before the wheel at the other end stared dragging him down).  But today, such a simple but powerful scene does not cut it.  So there are cars spinning through the air or flying up to take down helicopters and fighter jets shooting missiles.<br /><br />However, I think the best stuff in this movie are moments other than what stands out in the trailer.  The initial shoot out at Matt's apartment is probably my favorite sequence from the film and all of that computer movie magic is not as cool as when Wiseman gets the camera to swing around one of the cars that McClane is driving like a maniac.  So every time they ratchet up the special effects I found myself taking a step back from the movie instead of being drawn in.  After all, the point of using Carlin's article as a springboard is because something this horrible could really happen, which creates some dissonance when contrasted with McClane rolling around on top of a fighter jet.  Consequently, for me the decision to round up or down was going to come to the climax and what happens when our hero finally gets around to saying his \\"Yippee Ki Yay\\" line once again.  Would then go \\"old school\\" or \\"high tech\\"?  The rating above should give you a clue and \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" should be the biggest blockbuster this summer because to date it is far and away the best.  However, I did not recognize the piece of classical music they play in the second half of the end credits, and that is going to bug me to no end for the foreseeable future.room and before the wheel at the other end stared dragging him down).

B000PY52EU|5.0|When you see the trailer or the poster of \\"Black Snake Moan\\" you have to think that this film belongs on a double-feature with \\"Grindhouse\\" (okay, that would make it a triple feature).  After all, you have a black man holding a scantily clad young white woman in chains.  This is a movie that screams \\"EXPLOITATION!\\"  But the black man in question is Samuel L. Jackson, the white woman is Christina Ricci, and \\"Black Snake Moan\\" is written and directed by Craig Brewer, whose previous effort \\"[[ASIN:B000BITUWU Hustle & Flow]]\\" is remembered more for its Oscar winning song \\"It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp\\" rather than Terrence Howard's Oscar nominated performance by those who have not seen the movie (I would have voted for Howard over Philip Seymour Hoffman).  So you have to suspect with these people involved that \\"Black Snake Moan\\" is not just going to be something like \\"[[ASIN:B000NY0YP4 Diary of a Nymph]]\\" with a way bigger budget (actually the movie I was most reminded of when watching this one was \\"[[ASIN:B00008DDSC Secretary]]\\" because it was another movie after people with serious problems that ended up touching me).<br /><br />Jackson plays Lazarus, a broken-down blues musician whose wife has finally left him.  Lazarus makes his living as a vegetable market gardener living back in the woods all by his lonesome.  Ricci is Rae, whose boyfriend Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) makes love to her one more time before he goes off to join the military.  The problem is that as soon as Ronnie leaves the tearful Rae behind, she starts getting the need for lovin' something fierce.  Rae literally has an itch to scratch and she turns to the wrong guy, which is why Laz finds her battered body on the road near his place.  He takes care of her and discovers her story and not only decides that she needs to be cured of her nymphomania, but that the way to do this is to get a big ol' hunk of chain, put one end around her waist with a padlock and tie the other to the radiator in his house.  Laz feels the need to \\"suffer\\" Rae.  His mind is fixed and he will not be moved and we sure know damn well not to try and argue with the man.<br /><br />What happens next should be left for you to discover yourself and I think most viewers will be pleasantly surprised by the way this story plays out and impressed by the performances, which are arguably the best that Jackson and Ricci have done to date.  They certainly throw themselves into these roles, which for Jackson meant learning to play the guitar and sing the blues while Ricci got to pick out her chain.  I also like the character of the Reverend R.L., played by John Cothran, Jr., because the man talks sense, embodying Christian virtues without feeling the need to constantly quote Scripture.  I also liked that with both R.L. and the character of Angela (S. Epatha Merkerson), Laz is smart enough to know that what he is trying to do for Rae is not something he can do by himself.  Bonus points to Brewer for bringing back Kim Richards to play Rae's white trash moma, Sandy.  When trying to figure out who to get for the role Brewer tried to think of who was the Wednesday Addams when he was a kid and came up with Richards, whom he had a big-time crush on from \\"[[ASIN:B000FQISGC Escape to Witch Mountain]]\\" way back when.  I have to round up on this 2006 film just for that reason alone.ls the need to \\"suffer\\" Rae.

B00065MDRW|5.0|I had a fairly adequate stereo which was centered on a Thorens transcription turntable with an excellent stylus. It always cheered me up to hear this album played at moderate to somewhat loud volume levels. I won't get into the progressive rock chicken and egg debate, for I also appreciate many of the other groups mentioned but KC has a very special place in my hierarchy of rock bands. They made several other good recordings, again duly noted  in several reviews but I always have liked this one the best.      For those who have not heard this I would suggest attempting to hear part of it at least prior to buying as I realize this particular genre of rock can be considered an acquired taste.

B000QFAJ7S|5.0|Kelly Clarkson once again proves that she is a one of kind performer who never forgets her fans. The lyrics engulfing My December are honest, heartfelt and at times heart wrenching. She is a truly unique and versatile artist. She rips her life apart at the seams and pieces them together on paper. My December is her best! Kelly stays true to her fans that have followed her from the beginning. True fans didn't want a sequel to Breakaway/Thankful, we wanted the next chapter of a whole new book...and that is exactly what we got. This album along with her many many more to come continue to prove that she is an artist that will not only be around a long time but is a force within the music industry, to be reckoned with.
B000M5AJQI|5.0|very good movie liked it very much. appreciate the work of Nicholson and the other actors I hope we will see much more of that great Actor.  The movie itself is a hell of a good movie when it comes to story good picture quality defenetly a buy.

B00007KWHP|5.0|As a self-professed progressive rock aficionado, I'd always been a little ashamed that I didn't own one of the cornerstones of the genre: Yes' FRAGILE (1971). It was on my \\"to-get\\" list for the better part of two years, but every time it came time to place an order from Amazon I found other albums that seemed more \\"urgent\\", so to speak, and I wasn't willing to pay almost twice as much at a brick-and-mortar. But then just recently I decided to splurge and order half-a-dozen CDs I'd been meaning to get for a while, FRAGILE among them.     This album marks the inauguration Yes' most familiar lineup: Jon Anderson (vocals), Bill Bruford (drums), Steve Howe (guitar), Chris Squire (bass), and in his debut with the band, Rick Wakeman (keyboards). Interestingly enough, this \\"classic\\" incarnation of the band would only record three albums together, but they made some damn fine music in those three albums. This one can be broken into two distinct halves: one devoted to full band outings, the other to individual showcases for each bandmember. Yes was basically composed of five virtuosos at this point, so each solo piece is at the least interesting; Steve Howe's lovely classical guitar piece \\"Mood for a Day\\" and the \\"bass orchestra\\" of Chris Squire's \\"The Fish (Schindleria Praematurus)\\" stand out especially.     But it's the full band stuff that really shines. Of course you've heard \\"Roundabout\\", and if it's been overplayed on classic rock radio for three decades and change, it's still brilliant, a distillation of everything good about prog into an eight-minute monster that transcends traditional pop/rock structure but never overstays its welcome - AND it's catchy as hell! When it comes to the Rick Wakeman vs. Keith Emerson debate, I side with Emerson, but Wakeman's immense talent is undeniable, especially in the middle section of \\"South Side of the Sky\\", the album's second epic - beautiful piano here. The fluid, three-and-a-half-minute \\"Long Distance Runaround\\" defines Yes as well as any of their epics and would've seemed to me the obvious choice for a single. \\"Heart of the Sunrise\\", on the other hand, sprawls its way across the better part of twelve minutes, twelve minutes that contain both the serenest and the most intense music on the disc.    Is FRAGILE the masterpiece everybody makes it out to be? After listening to it in its entirety at last, my verdict is: probably not. Is it a great album though, and does it belong in the collection of any progressive rock fan - hell, classic rock fan in general? Well, to that I have only one thing say: YES.

B000KCHZK6|1.0|Norah Jones along with Macy Gray have the worst voices I've ever heard. There's nothing that Jones does to distinguish herself the same sounding songs over and over. With that voice I'm not quite sure how she has accomplished 3 cds already. It's shocking really and there are so many female artists that have better voices then what she has so do yourself a favor never buy a cd of Nora Jones unless you want to use it as a coaster. Otherwise she's just not worth listening too.

B000GIWS7E|5.0|This baby will never make it to my media storage unit. I've had it for about 3 weeks, and I've watched all the way through it about 6 times, and bits and pieces almost every night. I have no idea how it is that I missed this band over the years. I actually learned about them when this very same concert aired on PBS a couple of months ago. Now, they are at the top of my favorites heap.     DT's musicianship and band synergy is as good as it gets, and it is so obvious from this particular concert. Each member is the best at what they do, and together, they are greater than the sum of the parts.    I highly recommend this DVD.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|This is the kind of movie that you will want to watch more than once - at times, the action goes by quickly, and people that played through the Playstation game will probably pick up on more than other viewers ... there is so much incredible detail that was put into this movie that it's hard to appreciate it, or even pick up on all of it with just one viewing    I disagree that watchers who haven't played the game won't necessarily be interested in this - I agree that there are plenty of tie-ins to the game, but it's not that difficult for viewers to figure out what's going on, and the complex relationships between the characters become obvious as the movie plays out ... this movie is so well made and complete that it's easy to become attached to the characters without knowing them from the game    The sound track is superb - the use of heavy metal all the way to opera and how it's all used together in ways is just amazing ... and the clever use of a few FFVII game sound effects at perfectly placed times was hilarious in one scene, (for those who haven't played the game, listen for one of the main character's cell phone ring tone)     I can't say enough good things about the story line and the `acting' - the voiceovers are second to none ... the action sequences are just breathtaking and the plot progresses evenly, quickly and with a lot of detail (knowing the back story isn't necessary, but is helpful to fully understand the relationships)    I've watched this in both the English and Japanese versions, and both are excellent - once you see it a few times in English, give the Japanese a try    I would highly recommend this to anyone ... and like another reviewer of this movie, I also downloaded it before it came to the US - but, I also suggest anyone who DL's this to buy the DVD to support Square-Enix - this is revolutionary movie making, and we need to show our support so they continue to produce titles like this ... plus, the original DVD has deleted scenes and trailers that are well worth the small price    So, as stated earlier, even if you downloaded this, BUY THE DVD!

Our employees shared the books (30+) with each other and became a must read for transformational thinking within our Mills. The story is told by the penguins as their need for survival is at hand; reasoning for change is pointed out in such real examples of the fear for change, language of negativity, and the search for possibilities. Leaders wanting to focus attention on transformation that must happen to survive, need to get 'Our Iceberg Is Melting' for all their employees to read.

B00005JPQT|4.0|\\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" exists entirely within its own universe, one ruled by nonstop action sequences that are anything but realistic. I guarantee that anyone who sees this film will not in the least be interested in the plot, nor will they invest in any of the characters. They will see this film only to watch Bruce Willis engage in combat, dodge explosions, and perform daredevil stunts. This film accomplishes exactly what it set out to accomplish, and for that, I suppose a four-star rating is appropriate. But keep in mind that not everyone will appreciate this kind of filmmaking; it may be an escapist movie, but goodness gracious, how many action sequences can an audience handle in one sitting?    In all fairness, I appreciated that this film wasn't bogged down with details from the first three \\"Die Hard\\" films. Anyone who hasn't seen them will have nothing to worry about; the character development in this new film remains exactly the same, and there are no continuing plotlines. In other words, anyone new to this series doesn't have to bother with renting the first three films. What a relief; you pretty much get three films worth of action in this one, anyway. I can't recall a recent film that was so aggressive, so overloaded with eye candy that it overwhelms everything else. Maybe that's why, on some strange level, it works; it never stops to take a breath, and thus doesn't allow the audience to move back from the seat's edge.    But there's absolutely nothing to get out of the story, something so implausible and ambiguous it begs the question of why the filmmakers even bothered with a screenplay. The plot can basically be described in one sentence: NYPD officer John McClane (Willis) and computer hacker Matt Farrell (Justin Long) go after cyber-terrorist Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant), a man systematically gaining control of the country's power supplies. There's really nothing more about the story that needs to be explained. For that matter, there's nothing about the story to understand; Gabriel's motives are a complete mystery throughout most of the film, and by the time they are revealed, we really don't care anymore. It all boils down to the fact that he's the bad guy, and the good guy is trying to stop him. It doesn't get any more basic than that.    The progression of scenes is essentially guided by the potential for action; most scenes featuring McClane begin normally before turning into frenetic battles. In one scene, he's assigned to find Farrell and bring him in for questioning. As soon as Farrell is found, the scene becomes engulfed in gunfire; someone has sent assassins to kill Ferrell. Later on, they drive on a road in Washington, D.C. The traffic lights are eventually taken over by Gabriel, resulting in numerous car accidents, ugly pileups, and more shooting. And then they find themselves in a long tunnel. Gabriel attempts to kill them by allowing cars to enter from both ends. For extra fun, the tunnel lights are shut down. I can't begin to explain the significance of any of this. Then again, I suppose an explanation isn't necessary.    Thrown into the mix is McClane's daughter, Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), a character who adds nothing to the film other than an excuse to create extra conflict. She only uses about twenty minutes of screen time, the first five of which establishes that she and her father aren't getting along (she hates using his last name). The other fifteen minutes sees her in Gabriel's evil clutches, and of course, McClane has to save her. When compared to the film's entire length of 130 minutes, I think it's easy to understand why her character is insignificant. This isn't to say that her character hurts the film; the action is far too abundant for any of the characters to be troublesome. Quite simply, this is not a character-driven film. Even the inclusion of Kevin Smith as a caricature hacker doesn't change things too much.    So then what is this film driven by? That's easy. It's driven by cars that fly upwards and ram operating helicopters. By semi trucks that zoom across collapsing freeway overpasses. By shootouts, explosions, fighting, and characters hanging from perilous heights. By Willis having yet another opportunity to say, \\"Yippie ki yay [expletive deleted].\\" Everything is quick, loud, and in your face. Whether or not it's actually entertaining is open for debate; some will be thoroughly entertained while others will be begging for aspirin when the end credits start to roll. I don't dare reveal which category I fall into; believe me, it's enough that I'm actually giving this film four stars.    But I'd be lying if I said that I took this film seriously. There's nothing about it that indicates seriousness, which I'm sure is exactly what the filmmakers wanted. \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" is definitely a mindless film, but at the very least, it's a mindless film that knows what it's doing. Therefore, it delivers exactly as it promises. No attention was given to anything other than the entertainment factor; audiences sure like to see things blowing up and people flying through the air. If this is what you crave from a movie going experience, then by all means, go see this movie.
B000001DVD|5.0|There was a time, long, long ago when Def Leppard rocked. By listening to the band's musical out-put for the last fifteen years, it may be hard to believe that, but it's true. Early on, before \\"Let's Get Rocked,\\" before touring with Bryan Adams and Journey, before making adult-contemporary soft-rock with the stink-bomb \\"X,\\" (2002) there was a time when Def Leppard was genuinely a great rock band.<br /><br />Released at the start of a new decade, the Judas Priest sounding debut from Def Leppard, '\\"On through the Night,\\" (1980) may not have been the most original album of all-time, but it's still a great little-known gem in the chronicles of the NWOBHM (New Wave of British Heavy Metal). For their sophomore release, the band hooked-up with its unofficial sixth member, long-time Def Leppard collaborator and producer, John \\"Mutt\\" Lange. Released a year after the debut, Def Leppard's second album \\"High N' Dry\\" (1981) has some of the same NWOBHM elements that were on the \\"On though the Night, but also sees the band establishing its own identity and searching out new terrain.<br /><br />AC/DC's monumental album \\"Back in Black\\" (1980) no doubt had an influence on Def Leppard's \\"High N' Dry.\\" From singer Joe Elliot's attempts to sound like Brian Johnson, to guitarists Steve Clarke and Pete Willis attempts to imitate the Young brothers, \\"High N' Dry\\" sounds a lot like AC/DC. This isn't so surprising when you consider the fact that Lange produced \\"Back in Black.\\" That said, the seeds of Def Leppard's signature sound that is so apparent on \\"Pyromania\\" (1983) and \\"Hysteria,\\" (1987) like the melodic sing-along choruses and metallic yet infectious hooks, make their appearance on \\"High N' Dry.\\" In a sense \\"High N' Dry\\" can be seen as the album that bridged the gap between Def Leppard's NWOBHM years, apparent on their debut, to their definitive pop-metal heyday of \\"Pyromania\\" and \\"Hysteria.\\"<br /><br />The band's early line-up on their first three albums was by far the best. Sorry Phil Collin (and Vivian Campbell), but the Pete Willis/Steve Clarke combo were by far the finest duel-guitarists that the band ever had. Their riffs and solos throughout the album are just plain killer, easily as good as anything AC/DC had to offer (is it blasphemy to hold that opinion?). It should be noted that apart from \\"Hit and Run,\\" every song on \\"High N' Dry\\" was co-penned by either Clarke and/or Willis. With both long since gone (Willis was fired in '83 and Clarke died in '91) it's easy to see how the band has suffered creatively ever since. The songwriting throughout the whole disc is terrific, with very well-crafted but hard-rocking songs, one after the other, without a dud in the lot. Even the album's one balled \\"Bringing on the Heartbreak\\" sounds great and is light-years better than the syrupy trash that made up the band's most recent steaming-pile of manure, abomination of an album \\"X.\\"<br /><br />Another great feature of \\"High N' Dry\\" is its organic sound. While the band may be most well known for their ultra-slick \\"Hysteria,\\" on \\"High N' Dry\\" the band sounds a lot rawer, much more rough-around-the edges and a lot more ballsy than they would on later albums (\\"Pyromania\\" can be seen as a mid-way point between the two).<br /><br />\\"High N' Dry\\" is also great simply because the band wants to rock. Def Leppard at this point in their career were hungry and eager to prove to the world that they kicked ass, and they did. Don't believe Joe Elliot when he tells you that Def Leppard were always really a pop band at heart, not a metal one, that just isn't true. While there is a clear pop-sensibility to \\"High N' Dry\\" it most definitely has a metallic edge and a lot of balls.<br /><br />When I think of Def Leppard, I think of the group existing as two separate entities. First, there is the Def Leppard of the 80s, a great rock band who put out four terrific albums, even if they did get a little too commercial towards the end. And second there is the Def Leppard of the90s/00s, an embarrassment; a band for soccer moms, the less said about the better.<br /><br />So even if Def Leppard has sucked beyond belief for years, go back in time with \\"High N' Dry,\\" and rock out to an album from a once really great band.soccer moms, the less said about the better.      So even if Def Leppard has sucked beyond belief for years, go back in time with \\"High N' Dry,\\" and rock out to an album from a once really great band.
B000P0IW6E|5.0|I wish the sound and style was a little bit harder and meaner (like the \\"Hour 1\\" song), but other than that this is an exceptional CD. Very enjoyable. I've listened to this CD at least fifty times already and I'm still not bored of it. The Scorpions have always been my favorite band since I first discovered them back in the early 80's. You know something? They're still my favorite band! Thanx Klaus, Rudolf and Matthias..........

0743298020|5.0|Setting is what makes this novel work! Reminiscent of duMaurier's eerie settings, the characters impart an intriguing story which could not have been accomplished as well in any other way. Margaret, the daughter of a bookseller, has published only a few biographies, but best-selling author, Vida Winter, who has never before told her true life's story, chooses her to write her biography. Two women, one a story-teller and one a biographer, find that their commonality is that each is haunted by her own twin. The story of Miss Winter's life unravels little by little, exposing truth after bizarre truth as the story progresses. Finely crafted and artistically woven, this tale is merely enhanced by its focus on a sincere love for books.
B000RRT7OQ|4.0|I bought this Steelbook Edition of this rare 1.5 version of X-Men at Best Buy where I believe was an exclusive. Just recently, I watched the DVD for the first time (I haven't seen any X-Men movies at this time). The movie in itself is a great film that will surely entertain everyone; including those who are not typically Sci-Fi fans such as myself. The movie left me very much looking forward to seeing the other two movies, but only after watching this one AGAIN first.    Three of us watched this film and we watched it in the enhanced mode where \\"deleted scenes\\" and \\"behind the scenes looks\\" were cut into the picture. I was expecting the scenes to just be added in clearly and cleanly like they were for Spider-Man 2.1, however they were not. The deleted scenes were located on another part of the DVD causing brupt pauses before and after each scene came on. With two discs, one would think they would have put the two versions of the movie in this collection in SEPERATE spaces for continuous playback with either version. However, they did not. (Note the regular version of the movie is continuous and uninterupted.) In the enhanced mode, there are \\"X\\"s and \\"/\\"s that appear on your screen when either a \\"deleted scene\\" or a \\"behind the scenese look\\" comes up during the movie. For this reason, my rating of the movie gets a 4 out of 5 stars.     This Steelbook Edition, along with the other nine Steelbooks that recently came out in June of 2007, is a reprint of the 2-Disc previously released edition of X-Men 1.5. There's nothing new about it, but it gives those who missed out on the opportunity to get the 1.5 version a second chance. Even with the pausing and cues that occur in the enhanced viewing mode of the extended version, the same format was copied from the first release; which was done before Spider-Man 2.1 came out (which may explain the better viewing of Spidey).     X-Men, as I said before, was a very good movie. I highly recommend this Steelbook to anyone who's a fanof X-Men. The bonus features are plentiful and will give fans even more enjoyment of this great film in a highly preservable packaging. I understand this is a rare and limited Steelbook, but if you can get it, I'm sure you'll be satisfied.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|It truly takes several listens to fully grasp a new RUSH disc. So much going on, with complex musical passages, intelligent words, bold song structure. Vapor Trails, this disc's predecessor, was not one of my favorites. But all RUSH music not only shows us where they are and where they have been, it also shows us where they are headed.    Snakes and Arrows is one of my favorite RUSH discs. Have probably heard it 100 times since buying it the day it came out. Every song is strong and so diverse, but I do have my favorites. Armor and Sword is spectacular, as are Workin' Them Angels, The Larger Bowl, Faithless and Bravest Face. I love all the instrumentals, especially Malignant Narcissism.     Neil seems to be more at peace with life and with himself, and his lyrics are taking on a whole new depth. Geddy's vocals are stronger than ever, and so is his bass playing. Nice touch on the 'occasional' mellotron, too. And Alex does some of his playing ever. Such rich sounds, such energy.    My three favorite bands, RUSH, Dream Theather and Marillion have each blessed me with new music the past few months. But RUSH, my all-time favorite, recorded one of their finest works ever. Thank you gentlemen. See you on tour!
B000002HPT|5.0|This album is absolutely incredible, just like all Dream Theater albums are.  Yes, it IS their worst album, but that's not saying much.      Let me start off by saying that if you want to get into DT, this is not the album to start with.  DT is way far away from what they usually do in this album, so you won't get the right impression.    If you're a hardcore fan, SAVE THIS ALBUM FOR LAST.  After really getting into all the other albums b/c I ignored this b/c I heard it was a flop, it was a real treat at the end.    If you're somewhat of a fan, don't prioritize it over Images and Words, Awake, or Metropolis 2.    Ok so the REAL review:    New Millenium:  Wow, this is an awkward song.  Loose feel, and pretty groovy, in a good way.  All right, but this is DT, and when in the WORLD would they ever put the words \\"baby\\" in there music?  NOWHERE but here.  And it works too.  Not a good intro, but there isn't anything else that would work better choosing out of the songs on this album.  9/10    You Not Me:  You see, John Petrucci worked with some other non DT member in writing the lyrics, and this is what happens.  Its so one-dimensional, and, I hate to say it, boring.  Worst song on the album.  6/10    Peruvian Skies:  Wow, this is one of the best DT songs.  Its good.  LaBrie isn't weak on this one either.  Nice slow build to the jamming session with JP and MP.  10/10    Hollow Years:  Oh man, this would have been AWESOME if it was done before LaBrie injured his vocal cords.  Nice slow beautiful lyrical song.  I wouldn't even classify it as metal, maybe soft rock.  Catchy too, but LaBrie is real exposed and it keeps the song from scoring a 10. 9/10    Burning My Soul:  Lousy lyrics.  Lousy catchy little noises.  This is NOT Dream Theater.  Second worst song on the album, but still better than most mainstream music.  6.5/10    Hell's Kitchen:  Not one of their instrumental tracks that shines like The Dance of Eternity or Stream of Consciousness, but there's nothing reallybad to say about it.  10/10    Lines in the Sand:  Beautiful, lyrical, unfortunately LaBrie's accident doesn't help it.  9/10    Take Away My Pain:  Lovely song dedicated to JP's father.  Unfortunately, LaBrie makes a few notes kind of ugly, but not too many.  9.5/10    Anna Lee:  LaBrie is exposed, but he sings quite well despite his accident.  Beautiful song.  10/10    Trial of Tears:  Whoa.  Up there with Learning to Live, a Change of Seasons, Octavarium, etc. 15/10
B000N6U0E2|5.0|While this movie was only a slice out of Chris Gardner's book it was still incredibly well done.  It placed the focus on what was important about this man's journey and I applaud Will Smith and his team for being able to do that.  This movie inspired many and Will deserved those nominations for the role he played.
B000QFAJ7S|2.0|This album is on track with all the other Kelly Clarkson albums....average.  She has a nice voice, but her songs always seem to lack something.  This album has a angery tone, but it seems very plastic anger.  I don't feel that it's real anger.  She's seems to be making bland music.  No hooks, no beat, no emotion....nothing.  But than again, every Kelly album has been like that....<br /><br />Key Tracks:  Yeah, Hole, and Judis
B000OVLBF8|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  I did not know a lot about Ghost Rider from the comic books before seeing this movie, so I did not have any expectations going in.  Great effects.  Well acted.  Decent story.  Some parts of the plot were rather predictable, but still, a movie worth adding to your collection, especially if you are a superhero fan.
B000002OK3|5.0|For any fan of the movie, the soundtrack for Reservoir Dogs constantly brings you back to those gut-wrenching and mind-blowing scenes from the movie.<br /><br />A must have for any lover of the 70s or just the movie.
0805066691|5.0|I was told to read this book as i like to read about american history. this is one of the best book i have read. dee brown really did a lot of backgroud work on it .
B000QFAJ7S|4.0|I'm not someone who will give out 5 Star ratings for just anything.  It needs to be absolutely perfect for me to do that nowadays, and this album isn't perfect.  So, in order to make sure that the ratings mean something other than how big a fan I am of KC, this gets 3.5-4 stars, leaning towards four.    \\"Irvine\\" didn't work for me, it sounds like it belonged on \\"Breakaway\\", not \\"My December\\".  Also, this isn't the most lyrically-challenging album.  Most of the songs are of the Alanis Morisette/Pat Benatar grrrl-done-wrong vein without Pat Benatar's maturity or Alanis' variety.  It's the same thing a lot of people didn't like about Maroon 5's new album; the lyrics could have had a bit more variety and direction than \\"broken relationships\\".  Also... uhm , I missed the album in the store at first because the cover reminded me of Amy Lee's get-up in \\"Call Me When You're Sober\\".  Kelly strikes me as a bit \\"Evanescense-lite\\" at times, and I wish she'd have chosen a different cover, because she really isn't Amy Lee (not a dis, just an observation, folks, I like both).    I did enjoy the album greatly.  I'm hooked on \\"One Minute\\", \\"Sober\\", \\"Judas\\", \\"Yeah\\" and most of the rest of the album.  I find it smewhat odd that many reviewers, both professional and amateur, are saying that there aren't a lot of \\"radio-friendly\\" songs on the album.  I'm inclined to disagree.  I think if Daughtry can get play with his safe, generic \\"pop rock\\", so can Kelly Clarkson.  IF people are willing to accept a dramatic change; that seems to be what really is at issue here.  It's not that it's a bad album, it's that it is not \\"Breakaway, Part 2\\".      I, for one, prefer the sound of this album, even if I think that \\"Breakaway\\" was a bit lyrically stronger.  However, \\"Breakaway\\" didn't keep my interest the whole way through as \\"My December\\" did, and that's the most important thing.  It grabbed my attention and kept it the whole way through.  No big sappy ballads to bore me. Hopefully she'll maturea bit more and write a stronger album next time.  I'm looking forward to giving the next one a 4-5 star review ;)
B000PMGS8G|3.0|I won't be buying this one as i sent away to uk for the Silver version.  It's very nice. I've always loved this movie.  Brian Blessed's audio commentary is wonderful and it's well worth getting the uk version for that extra feature alone.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I really liked the series.  The movie brought alot of answers that the series left open.
B000001GQP|5.0|It's definitively the best adaptation of Carl Orff's masterpiece with astonishing vocal parts.Surely a \\"must have\\" CD for everyone who loves classical music at his best.
B000M343BM|5.0|This movie is my all time favorite sports comedy.  I have watched this movie over and over with the same results, tears coming out of my eyes.  I was happy to find it on Amazon after going to Blockbuster and being told it was only available on VHS and not DVD.  If you like baseball then you will love this movie.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Best documentary that I have ever seen.  You will look at our world differently after watching.
B000EPFPVU|5.0|That about sums it up for this album.  Tool's music is so moving and trance setting.  The band has been my favorite since hearing them for the first time in the early 90's.  People ask me all the time what kind of music are they and I have always responded with \\"the Pink Floyd of today\\".  10,000 days is now my favorite Tool album but it seems that each time they come out with a new album it becomes my favorite.  I guess the sayings true, \\"Things get better with age\\".    Buy it, you won't be let down.
1591841666|5.0|Great insights from Seth Godin. You hear a lot about doing things that are 'good' not 'great' because great takes too much effort. This book shows how being great is the key to real success -- and how to know what things to focus your energy on: so your greatness will pay off.
B000O178BY|5.0|I got it the first day it was released, what an amazing collection of songs. A departure from what Trent usually sings about, but that by no means its different as a whole. Its still NIN. I love this album, I listen to it 3 or 4 times a week. A must buy.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|I think I blew out a speaker in my car listening to this CD... It is fabulous
B000O5AYCA|5.0|The first notes of this album blew me away; this album starts strong with \\"Fake Empire,\\" a confusing and beautifully tempoed (if that's a word) song. As with other National albums, this one does take some getting used to, off the bat I really enjoyed \\"Slow Show\\" and \\"Ada,\\" but now I'm getting into   \\"Apartment Story\\" and \\"Racing like a pro.\\" I would probably recommend getting \\"Alligator\\" first if you are new to the National, but this album is stellar.
B0001HAHXW|5.0|He finally gets to do what he loved best, the \\"blues\\". A great musician for the modern age.
B000RW3YYA|4.0|Season 3 was a definate improvement over season 2.  There are a number of different reasons for this; *WARNING*:  Some Spoilers ahead!<br /><br />First off, more interesting stories with both gains and losses!  They fleshed out a few of the characters a bit more like Ronan and Rodney, but again left Teyla out in the cold!  I thought her character was pretty good in the first season, but around the middle of season 2 through the end of 3, I completely lost interest in her.  She basically just stands around as a little eye candy; when she is even in a scene!  Lately she has come across as somewhat condesending with a \\"holier-than-thou\\" attitude.  If they killed her off, I wouldn't miss her!  (I read somewhere that she is pregnant, so the writers are putting that in some of the 4th season episodes, meaning less screen time!  The rumor also hinted that she will rejoin \\"what is left of her people\\", and leave SGA!)<br /><br />This also brings up characters that ARE lost, and others we will gain.  The first character we lost was Dr. Carlson Beckett in the episode \\"Sunday\\"!  A very sad episode!  I really liked his character.  He was a really nice, cool and calm guy, providing a moral center like Daniel Jackson did for SG-1, which was a perfect \\"yin\\" to Rodney McKay's hypertensive, egocentric and often rude \\"yang\\".  Replacing him will be Jewel Staite as Dr. Jennifer Keller (best known from Firefly).  She looks more grown-up, adult-like on SG Atlantis than her more kid-like character did from Firefly.  (Which is good if she is to be taken seriously)  And as always, she is definately still a hottie!<br /><br />Another character will be Dr. Elizabeth Weir.  Her role has been slowly spiraling downwards in season 3, so much like Teyla, I won't really miss her!  Although her fate was undecided at the end of this season, she is going to die in season 4 and will be replaced with an SG-1 veteran, Col. Samantha Carter!  She will become the new Atlantis commander and should replace Carson as a spring board for Rodney.  With their past chemistry it will be like mixing acids and bases, getting quite a volatile reaction at first, but neutralizing in the end.  Sheppard and her should also butt heads a lot as she will out-rank him militarily.<br /><br />Lastly, I've also read some of the previous reviews and would have to disagree with some of their comments.  First off, Rodney McKay is HILARIOUS!  His character's annoying, smug attitude is what makes him so funny!  Especially with the different reactions the other characters give Rodney when interacting with him!  (Ex.'s:  Sheppard and Ronon threaten him when he gets annoying; Carson (use to) patronize him even though Rodney didn't realize it, etc.)  One thing I didn't like about this season was how the Wraith were practically non-existent!  Instead they replaced them with the Replicators!  These done-to-death bad guys are really starting to get old since they've been used so much in SG-1.  I think the only good point of having them on Atlantis was learning more about their origins.  They need to bring the Wraith back since they are the pre-dominant bad guys for Atlantis and need to delve deeper into their culture, weaknesses, etc.<br /><br />Whatever your opinion on the 3rd season of Atlantis, most people will agree it has gotten better since season 2.  And with all the quick changes at the end of the 3rd like 2 major characters dying/replaced and Atlantis itself heading off to a new planet to put down new roots, it gives potential for an awesome season 4!  Lets just hope they don't screw it up!Carson as a spring board for Rodney.

B0002B15XI|5.0|One of the first and best anti-war, tell it like it is, movies. Started a great tv series.
B000E41MRC|5.0|I am a huge WWII and civil war fan and this movie was an excellent portrayal of Hitler rising to power in Nuremberg. The movie is in German, but with English subtitles, but is still a very powerful work of history/propaganda.
B00011RPB0|5.0|I watched because I thought Scarlett was going to be the new Marilyn Monroe. Bill Murray is very funny though.
B000MNP2KI|3.0|XXXXX<br /><br />This movie is based on the book \\"Casino Royale\\" (1953) by the late Ian Fleming.  It is the 21ST  \\"official\\" (meaning EON Productions) Bond movie with Daniel Craig being the 6TH actor to play James Bond.<br /><br />Before this movie came out, Bond movies covered a period of 40 years beginning with 1962's \\"Dr. No\\" and ending with 2002's \\"Die Another Day.\\"<br /><br />This movie is about James Bond receiving his \\"double oh\\" status and completing his first mission as \\"007.\\"<br /><br />The movie's strong points are that it has a lot of action and good special effects.  In fact, before explaining anything to the viewer, there is a long chase scene with death-defying leaps and bounds.  It is quite well done.  There is another long chase scene that follows this chase.  It, too, is quite well done.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the story is difficult to follow and is somewhat complicated.  In fact, I had to view this movie twice in order to completely understand it.<br /><br />It is after about 50 minutes (that's right, 50 minutes!!) into this long movie that you actually learn exactly who Bond was chasing both times and you learn the details of Bond's first assignment.<br /><br />You have to understand two things in order to understand Bond's first assignment: the basics of how stock options work and the basics of a poker game called \\"Texas Hold'Em\\" (a variation of the poker game called seven card stud).  This, personally, is why I'm amazed that this movie has received such high ratings from others--I don't believe that all people who view this movie know such things.  For the record, I know the basics of these things and, in fact, my interest increased at this point.<br /><br />For Bond's first assignment we're told what he has to do.  Oddly enough, we're not told why he has to do it.  I found this frustrating and had to guess why he was on this assignment.  It turns out I guessed right by reading some articles about this movie after I had viewed it.  The point is that you will have to do some guessing while watching this movie.<br /><br />You may need a brochure to figure out all the bad guys that pop in and out.  The main villain seems to be someone called Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), \\"private banker to the world's terrorists.\\"  What I noticed is that this villain is not very villainous (except in his last few scenes).<br /><br />The Bond girl has the name of Vesper Lyn (Eva Green).  She's integral to the plot and especially to the movie's long, somewhat predictable, ending.  The ending reminded me of the 1969 Bond movie called \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service.\\"  Sean Connery who was playing Bond at the time wisely did not perform in this movie.<br /><br />When viewing this movie, don't expect to see the James Bond that you've seen in the last forty years.  There is no Miss Moneypenny, no gun barrel walk, no Q and, thus no gadgets.  (Apparently in the book, Q is not mentioned so there are no gadgets.  Actually, there is a gadget that Bond in this movie uses extensively--a cell phone.)<br /><br />In my mind's eye, I compared Daniel Craig to the other five Bond actors that came before him (namely Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, and Pierce Brosnan).  In my opinion, he doesn't fit the mold of a James bond.  Sure, he's physically fit but there's more to Bond than just being fit!  (Actually, Craig does look like Bond in the last thirty seconds of the movie.)<br /><br />I also missed the Bond music.  The background music is good but does not compare to the distinctive music associated with James Bond movies. (Bond-type music is played when the end credits roll.)<br /><br />The thing I missed most is the James Bond witticisms and snappy dialogue.  For example, here is some dialogue from 1964's \\"Goldfinger\\" where Bond is tied down on a gold slab with a laser beam cutting the slab and slowly inching up threatening to cut Bond in half:<br /><br />Bond says to Goldfinger: \\"You don't expect me to talk, doyou?\\"<br />Goldfinger's priceless reply:  \\"No, Mr. Bond.  I expect you to DIE.\\"<br /><br />Now, this movie is not entirely devoid of humor but it's not nearly as witty as expected.<br /><br />Filming for this movie took place in the Czech Republic, Bahamas, Italy, and England.<br /><br />Finally, the DVD (the one released March, 2007) I have is perfect in picture and sound quality.  There are several interesting extras included on a second disc.<br /><br />In conclusion, for those who are not James Bond fans and looking to see a good action movie, this is the film to see.  However, many true Bond fans may ask themselves the following:<br /><br />\\"Is this a James Bond movie or is this an action movie that happens to have somebody named James Bond in it?\\"<br /><br />(2006;  2 hr, 25 min;  wide screen;  2 discs;  28 scenes)<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko or \\"Uncle Stevie,\\" London, Ontario, Canada>><br /><br />XXXXXyou?\\"<br />Goldfinger's priceless reply:  \\"No, Mr. Bond.  I expect you to DIE.\\"<br /><br />Now, this movie is not entirely devoid of humor but it's not nearly as witty as expected.<br /><br />Filming for this movie took place in the Czech Republic, Bahamas, Italy, and England.<br /><br />Finally, the DVD (the one released March, 2007) I have is perfect in picture and sound quality.

0312323867|5.0|If you're the kind of reader who can finish a book in 2 nights (gotta be good) and hate saying goodbye to the characters once you're done, then Something Borrowed and Something Blue are your dream come true.  I loved Borrowed, and, as usual, wanted to know what happened to the characters at the end - Blue picks right up with Darcy's character, and keeps you laughing & 'aw'-ing all the way to the end (when you might have a couple tears like me :) ). So I'd definitely recommend getting both together.  Too bad Baby Proof doesn't keep up the previous characters, but you get the resolution you need at the end of Blue so you don't have to keep thinking 'wonder what happened?' :)
B000MR9D5E|4.0|The BBC has beautifully produced an elegant royal nature film.  One is awed at the poetic images that have been captured by various videographers.  Hot air balloons, cranes, and ladders were employed to bring out perspectives we usually are not accustomed to in nature films.  Series producer Fothergill \\"the power of the scenery is one of the things that has driven what we've done\\".  And early on in viewing this film you realize that it's mostly about the images.  And it's the imagry which drives the narritive.  True scientific substance is lacking.  The narrator mostly describes what you are seeing.  Sure there are nature trivia facts interspersed within the narration.  But the scientifica is shallow.  Sigourney Weaver narrates the Nature Channel televised edition in the USA.  She brings a sultry professional quality to the project.  But its David Attenborough who brings unabashed passion to the 5 disc DVD set.  For pure beauty sake this is a grand achievement.  But for \\"Natural History\\" meat & potatos you must go elsewhere.

B000PAU032|5.0|Silva's newest composer compilation is a great addition to it's \\"Essential\\" line of CD releases.    There are plenty of new tracks here conducted by producer James Fitzpatrick (Crimson Tide, The Thin Red Line, Thelma & Louise, The Da Vinci Code, Green Card, Driving Miss Daisy, and Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest.)    Recycled tracks from previous Silva Screen CDs are:  Gladiator - Symphonic Suite - 2002's The Fantasy Album and 2005's EPICS  Gladitor - Now We Are Free (Vocal) - 2005's Epics  The Da Vinci Code - Kyrie for the Magdelene - 2006's Greatest Cinema Choral Classics  Rain Man - 1994's Music from the Films of Tom Cruise  Days of Thunder - 1994's Music from the Films of Tom Cruise  Pearl Harbor - 2004's Longest Day: Ultimate World War Themes  The Last Samurai - 2005's EPICS  Batman Begins - 2006's Comic Strip Heroes  Hannibal - 2001's Cinema Choral Classics III  The Rock - 1998's Hollywood Stars: Music from the Films of Sean Connery  Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl - 2005's EPICS  Gladitor - Now We Are Free (Instrumental) - 2004's Reel Chill      Highly recommended for fans who are not familiar with Hans Zimmer's music, or those who want to hear a different take on it.    Producer James Fitzpatrick states in the informative liner notes that \\"the orchestrators, arrangers and myself decided to go for a totally symphonic approach and treatment of the music : as if the music has been arranged for the concert hall....Other tracks are all essentially orchestral but with a few subtle synthetic additives, mostly in the \\"bottom end\\" and the percussion department.\\"    Definitely worth a spin, and a welcome release to put all the Silva Zimmer tracks in one fine collection.    Edited to add: Mark Ayres provides (uncredited) additional keyboards and percussion on \\"The Rock\\".
B00006CXSS|5.0|The Greatest Generation, I now know just why they are called that.  I could only hope I would have the kind of courage these boys had back in 45.  I would just like to say a sincere THANK YOU to all who have served our country so bravely.  This is great TV!
1592402038|5.0|Does seeing the following make you want to yank your hair out?  Or if you're bald, shred your toupee?  \\"We are open during the hour's of 9 AM to 5:30 PM\\", \\"Sorry, were closed,\\" or \\"Your a cool guy?\\"  Then Eats Shoots and Leaves is the book for you.<br /><br />As someone who still goes through the trouble to capitalize at the beginning of each sentence and make it is properly punctuated even in emails, Lynne Truss's Eats Shoots and Leaves was a perfect book for me.  I thought I was anally punctuation-oriented, this woman takes the cake, but I really respect her for that.  She alone seems to hold the tattered flag of commas, apostrophes, semicolons, colons, and dashes in an Internet world where such little marks are considered excess characters. Basically, the way she puts it, \\"punctuation herds words together, keeps others apart.\\"  But they also serve as necessary pauses between sentences or clauses.  Per Cecil Hartley's poem, a comma is one pause length, a semicolon two, a colon three, and a period four.  An interesting bit, I thought.<br /><br />She gives equal time to apostrophes and takes the time to discuss possessives--you remember those, mine, his, ours, its, etc.  She also explains when and how they are used, such as a possessive in a singular noun, or the quantity of time--one week's work.  What I didn't know was how ancient historical figures don't need an `s' after the apostrophe, such as Socrates' or Archimedes', but that more modern figures do, such as Keats's.  However, she does point out how certain families, institutions, companies, etc. have authority over how they spell their names, so technically, it should be St. Thomas's Hospital, but it's St. Thomas' Hospital.<br /><br />Seeing as how the famous panda joke was caused by an excess of commas, Truss leaves no doubt that the comma is a very important punctuation mark, after the period, of course.  For example, \\"What is this thing called love?\\" and \\"What is this thing called, love?\\" are two sentences that have two totally different meanings.  Basically though, she does reaffirm the basic info that commas are correctly placed if they can replace the words \\"and\\" and \\"or.\\"  For example, \\"You can take your vacation in Tokyo, Osaka, Himeji, or Sapporo.\\"  However, I noticed one crucial difference.  Had it been in Britain, the above sentence would not have the comma after Himeji.  In America, there is.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Truss's no-tolerance approach to the punctuation-challenged masses can be seen, yet she endows her writing with quite a sense of humour and passion.  When she mentions how she would've loved to bear the children of Aldus Manutius the Elder, who flourished during the 15th and 16th century, and who along with his offspring took the virgule and made it into a comma, as well as inventing the italic typeface and semicolon, well, need I go on.  But she also relates, the way she upstaged a pen-pal of average writing skills by demonstrating her superior vocabulary and using a semicolon properly.  The pen-pal never wrote back, clearly bewildered by Truss's prowess.  As she quotes from that one scene in Crocodile Dundee, \\"That's not a knife.  THAT's a knife.\\"  But she does go through the history of punctuation marks, even citing various modern and classic works to illustrate her point.<br /><br />She is a bit mixed on Netspeak.  Granted, no one person is in control of it, as in Big Brother in 1984, but its overinclusiveness means that all rules on punctuation are off.  She isn't a fan of emoticons because whoever uses them \\"cried out for an ornamental function,\\" plus they are \\"a paltry substitute for expressing oneself properly.\\"  I'm guilty as the next person for using them, but it depends on the person I'm emailing or Instant Messaging.<br /><br />Having this as well as Strunk's book on writing style will put one far ahead in the game for punctuating properly.  And a panda-sized thanks to Ms. Truss for writing this book.<br /><br />P.S. This panda eats shoots and leaves.  Ha!
0316010669|2.0|I had high expectations for this book because of reviews from my friends, but this book is basically a rehashing rip-off of any psychology course in high school. I am a psychology major and I was hoping for new ideas about how to judge things quickly with very little information, but the book ended up being a series of anecdotes about snap-judgment situations. The level of analysis was very poor and unoriginal, and the ideas were completely innocuous. Nothing in this book was interesting.
B00000F169|4.0|This is well worth getting. Starting out as a student picture for debut director John Carpenter, he turned out a minor classic on an absolute showstring budget.<br /><br />The film is about the crew of a spaceship, whose purpose is to destroy planets making way for colonisation. The crew are very bored. To make things more interesting an Alien escapes from the hold and proceeds to torment one of the crew. This sequence is extremly funny. The other main area of the film revolves around a bomb that seems to have a mind of its own. The dialog between the bomb and the crew and the ships computer is very funny. The film finishes with what is probably a comedic reference to 2001.<br /><br />For a film made on such a small budget Carpenter achieved mircles. It wouldn't surprise me at all if Alien was inspired to some degree by this film, and indeed Alien does reference Dark Star according to the IMDB and of course Dan O'Bannon was involved in both films. At 80 minutes long its the perfect length - there is no time for you to get bored. If there has been a better sci-fi comedy made I haven't seen it.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|Being an avid Linkin Park fan I really didn't like this CD. A completely different sound than what I'm used to listening to.
0062515675|5.0|This is a very light read. My spirits were uplifted after reading this book. So I would rate it 5 stars.    Mostly the author has drawn inspirations from Gita and other Vedic books either directly or indirectly but bottom line is that it is a good read.
B0007NFL18|2.0|Let's be honest. When a rapper has only hype going for him then an album like this bound to happen. Get Rich Or Die Tryin' was far from a classic but its the best album 50's ever made and this one proves it. The biggest flaw of the album is repetition. You've heard it all before on Get Rich Or Die Tryin so thats a problem. The production is suspect is another problem.<br /><br />The Good: Ski Mask Way and Hate Or Love It Remix(featuring G-unit) are the best tracks on here. Just A Lil Bit is okay but thats it. The Bad: In My Hood while the beat is not bad 50,s verses leave something to be desired. This Is 50 and Im Supposed To Die Tonight, I Dont Need Em and Position Of Power are all fillerific tracks. Disco Inferno was a corny club track and he shot and missed with the failed club attempt Outta Control(the remix is trash too).  The Ugly: Candy Shop featuring Olivia sucks! Plus Scott Storch shouldnt be allowed to produce porno music seeing that his beats would kill the mood!  Gatman and Robin feat. Eminem is hot garbage and Em's beats get lamer and lamer. Case in point with Toy Soldiers, the track was butt and so was that beat and is it me or does that hook sound exactly like 2pac's Lil Homies? Piggybank is the worst diss record in rap history and Gunz Come Out is about as grating as somebody scratching a chalkboard with their fingernails. So Amazing and Build You Up are to power ballads that should have been shelved like this album. Bottom Line: 50 Cent's The Massacre is the worst sophomore jinx of all sophomore jinxes. The production was weak, 50 uninspired and the chick songs made Mesmerized sound like I Need Love. One last thing before I leave. You Brokeback Mountaineers need to take your a**es back to the farm where you belong(dont forget to take your crossdressing metalhead brothers with you). Every time I come on here I have to read your snide remarks and the funny thing is that you are all a bunch of balless sissies! You hate these rappers just because they are doing better than you. You jealous cowards! You schizophrenic baboons! What punks! I really feel for anybody that has you bipolar f****ts as friends! Inbred chumps!doing better than you. You jealous cowards! You schizophrenic baboons! What punks! I really feel for anybody that has you bipolar f****ts as friends! Inbred chumps!
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|I think the media's reaction the whole Kelly and Clive debaucle kind of put the lime light on the pre-album events.  Whats really into question here is the actual music.  I congratulate kelly for sticking to her guns, and keeping it real.  Not only has she turned down HUGE amounts of money for not only refusing to compromise on elements she thought didn't need comprising, but she even refused to sing NEVER AGAIN on the AMERICAN IDOL GIVES BACK special, citing she wasn't going to promote her single/album while the event was for starving people in Africa and the US.  Kelly not only is a true woman in my eyes, her songwriting and compilation skills are untouched.  She is only one in handfull of artists who can actually call themselves artists.  If MY DECEMBER isn't a hit, at least she can carry the one things she needs to the next album, credibility.    1) NEVER AGAIN (8/10) Probably one of the only songs on the album to have a \\"hook\\" or that is more or less \\"radio-friendly\\".  Although radio didn't receive this song very well, every other outlet (iTUNES, AOLMUSIC, YAHOO! MUSIC) shows this song is a hit.  2)  ONE MINUTE (7/10)  If you saw the Daytona 500 you were introduced to this very unique single.  Definitely an addictive chorus to provide a good \\"hook\\".  Definitely has a good sound and could make a good single.  It just lacks that extra, what do you call it?  3)  HOLE (6/10)  Vocally the song is on par.  Musically it is on par with the album.  But thats the problem its just one of those on par songs.  Lyrically, probably one of her better written songs, just lacking something.  4)  SOBER (9/10) One of the better songs on the album.  A metaphor that everyone can relate to, the song delivers strong conviction and even stronger vocals.  The beginning starts a little slow, but toward the end of the song Kelly's vocals shine brighter than the North Star.   5)  DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME (5/10) Kind of feels like a \\"filler song\\".  If the chorus was a little different this song could have made a better impression.  With a weak chorus, this song won't be overly played on the iPOD.  6) JUDAS (8/10) One of Kelly's more \\"edgier\\" songs.  The lyrics bitter, the music fitting, and the vocals impeccable.  One of the under-dogs of the album.    7) HAUNTED (8/10) A good continuation from BREAKAWAYs Hear Me and Addicted.  The musics flow up and down makes this song hypnotic and definitely one to remember.  Evanescence-esque, but Clarkson says CHECKMATE to Amy Lee  8) BE STILL (7/10) Laid back, low key, smooth, silky, and simplistic.  The song needs nothing more than just a hook.  Definitely a mellow song to lay back and think with.  9) MAYBE (8/10) A good song with excellent vocals. Simplistic yet intricate.  The live versions are far superior to the album version, but give credit when its due.  10) HOW I FEEL (6/10) Spunky lyrics and light guitars make this song seem BREAKAWAY-esque.  Although it lightens the mood of the album it isn't one of the strongest on the album.  I wouldn't call it filler, but edging the lines.  11) YEAH (6/10) Kind of takes you back a decade.  Clarkson's vocals are great and the song is definitely something you won't forget, but again, its one of those have to be in the mood songs.  Could a future album be more R&B? She has the voice.  12) CAN I HAVE A KISS (9/10) A surprising contender for one of the better songs of the album.  Even Clarkson admitted the song has received good reviews.  I'm not sure if it's the lyrics or the music, but the song grabs you and is definitely a winner for \\"CAR KAROKE!\\"  13) IRVINE (10/10) The winner.  The song with the most heart.  The song with the most song.  The song with the most riveting lyrics.  Couldn't have picked a better song to close the album.  Don't be suprised to see this song incorporated into film and/or TV.  14)* CHIVAS (8/10) A hidden track that at first seems to have no agenda. After a further listen and a google search, apparently SOBER was written for other reason. LOL.The song is awesome and shows Kelly more adult side.      Although some songs are \\"filler-esque\\" this is definitely one of the best albums of 2007 thus far.  We are all rooting for Kelly, and the next album is already in the makes.
0143038419|5.0|Best book I've read in a long time.  Actually used a highlighter in this one to mark particular groups of words that just resonated with me.  A soulful, well-written book.  I didn't want it to end.
B000068FWC|5.0|This album, back in 1978, seemed like it had fallen from heaven. The production values are gorgeous, resembling the WIlsons' studio work in finesse and brilliance. The songs themselves, from \\"Gone Hollywood\\" and \\"Goodbye Stranger\\" to \\"Take the Long Way home\\" could be baby-boomers-hipster's national anthems. Use of sounds like harmonica, whistling, clarinet and sax, and Hodgson's very searing guitar work, at select times (as in Goodbye Stranger) are reminiscent of the Beach Boys and Beatles as well. This is really glorious pop rock, informed by classical, jazz, and hard rock influences. The beats of the songs measure, very carefully, a kind of hammering, clattering dance beat--this is, as another said, very fun music. Biting social commentary, as well, on the star machine, and consumerist society. These guys had it all, and here they were meshed together tighter than a Toyota six-speed. Rev this thing up and let 'er fly.

0515141429|2.0|Lee Child's Killing Floor has gotten rave reviews as has Child for most of his work within his genre.  To be candid, I just don't get it.  What the book does have going for it is that it is a \\"page turner\\".  That hardly makes up for its deficiencies in many other areas.<br /><br />Clich&eacute;.  This book is loaded with clich&eacute; in both plot and dialogue.  With a simple red liner, an editor could have taken this from a fair book to a good book by taking out trite dialogue that is eye rolling and mind numbing.  Flaws in plot can be overlooked but the numerous times where characters state the utter obvious and \\"go macho\\" is a killer to this book.  In fact, the only reason I finished it was some general need to find out what the author was going to do with the Stuart Woods type of plot and the fact that it was so highly recommended to me by readers who typically have my taste.  Not with old Jack Reacher.<br /><br />Character development.  Only in its very nascent stages.  We don't really know why any of the main characters are who they are, or where they are, save a few explanatory sentences.  That hardly creates a sense of intimacy with a cast of characters we are expected to care about for a few hundred pages.  The romance that occurs in this book is without real reason, other than time and place (good enough for some I suppose).<br /><br />I am glad I finally read Lee Child.  It will take a lot of convincing to get me to read him again. Mysteries are supposed to be fun - not make the reader into a critic, which is exactly what Killing Floor did to me.
B00006LI4S|5.0|Amazing guitar playing combined with the same Pink Floyd voice which made classics out of Roger's songs. His own songrwiting is also present as well as the usual Floydian reminisence to Syd.    A highlight is his one-guitar Shine On You Crazy Diamond.    I loved this concert and have seen it many times since buying it. It is a very, very recommendable purchase.
B000P6R6X8|4.0|I made a mistake when I listened to this for the first time. I expected it to touch me and move me the way Wilco's previously records have, immediately. There is no way any album can meet that expectation. But its a mistake I, and others, make all the time. Some folks only want a fresh take on what they already know they like. This is not re-gurg rock. Its not YHF. Its not A Ghost is Born. Its Sky Blue Sky.    Here I am one month later and I really love this album. I found everything I want from a Wilco record in Sky Blue Sky. The roller coasters are there, its just not the same ride as before. Nor should it be. The hooks are there where you least expect them. The irritating moments of the first few listens (Shake it Off's tempo or Impossible Germany's verbiage) have long faded. Whats left is satisfying and heartfelt.    Let yourself get lost in it and you too can find exactly what you didn't know you were looking for.
1582701709|5.0|I love this book.  It is changing my life daily.  I read it over and over again.  Very inspirational and fun.
B000002Q88|3.0|This is probably Kansas weakest album and it is really too band as I think it had potential for greatness.  The album follows a loose concept about a flood that wiped out the small Kansas town of Neosho Falls in 1951.  When I found out Kansas was working on a concept album I really had high hopes as I thought they were one band that really could pull off something special.  Unfortunately due to record company pressure for a hit they pulled in outside songwriters for about a third of the material on the album and the results are a mish-mash that only vaguely stuck to the concept and provided a whole cadre of mediocre songs.  The single \\"Stand Beside Me\\" was obviously written specifically for radio airplay and Kansas fans rejected it in droves as it sank down the charts soon after release.  All of the outside written songs are throwaways.  If you cut them out what you have is a decent Kansas album that loosely sticks to the theme of the small town flood and history scenario.  All that being said there are 4 tracks on this album that are excellent and make it worth owning.  The opening track \\"Ghosts\\" sets the stage for the concept and is a great moody piece with Steve Walsh sounding better than ever with great lyrics and vocals.  The song really sets up the concept well, but alas it get abandoned fairly quickly.  \\"The Preacher\\" is another great Walsh tune telling the tale of a gospel preacher in all his fire and brimstone glory.  I always wondered if this was some kind of a reaction to Kerry Livgren's Christian oriented writing on earlier albums.  Either way this is a great song.  \\"Rainmaker\\" is another story teller song and the most progressive rock oriented piece on the disc.  The middle instrumental section is prime Kansas with Walsh's keys and Morse's guitar tearing it up.  \\"Bells Of St James\\" is the album closer and another great tune about a soldier who gets a \\"Dear John\\" letter from his girlfriend back home while he is off to war.  It is another great tune.  There are two other songs that are worth noting, neither are great, but both \\"One Big Sky\\" and \\"House On Fire\\" are pretty good tunes as well.  \\"Spirit\\" would prove to be the album that broke the band once again.  It did not sell very well and the tour was conducted in clubs instead of theaters.  The band's sold out arena days were long behind them and in the end Steve Morse moved completely out of music for a while before eventually replacing Richie Blackmore in Deep Purple.  The band would not release another new studio album for close to a decade.  \\"Spirit Of Things\\" is not essential Kansas, but there are 4 great songs that make it worth owning.
0618680004|1.0|In \\"The God Delusion,\\" Richard Dawkins performs an Olympic medal-worthy feat. He writes 400 pages while simultaneously patting himself on the back and blowing his own horn. \\"South Park\\"'s satire of Dawkins' megalomania is better than Cliff Notes, because -- unlike Dawkins -- when it tries to be funny, it is.<br /><br />I purchased \\"The God Delusion\\" expecting state-of-the-art atheism. Dawkins delivered a silly rant and a self-indulgent hodgepodge. He's preaching to the atheist choir, who exult \\"amen\\" at every burp.<br /><br />The book is so scattered, so without intellectual discipline, so rife with falsehoods, misrepresentations, and blood curdling irresponsibility, that it is impossible, here, to deliver a thorough review. I can merely pick and choose.<br /><br />Dawkins quotes letters from persons of faith who are, obviously, obnoxious. This proves nothing. Atheists can be obnoxious (Christopher Hitchens) or mass murderers (Stalin).<br /><br />Dawkins, like Hitchens, conflates all religions and religious practices. They really do not perceive the differences between Jainism and Islam, between \\"zakat\\" and \\"jihad\\". They, thus, disqualify themselves as commentators, except to the most unquestioning of atheist acolytes. Luckily the rest of us, when assessing science, are not so blind - we can discriminate between a Mengele and an Einstein.<br /><br />Dawkins insists that the foundation of the US is atheist. Dawkins fails to acknowledge that \\"all are created equal\\" is a Judeo-Christian invention. It is not Hindu (caste); it is not Muslim (dhimmitude); it is not scientific (eugenics; social Darwinism).<br /><br />Dawkins, like Hitchens, is a broken faucet of snide comments about anyone who disagrees with him. His put down of Stephen Jay Gould, with its overtones of homophobia, is particularly egregious (55). Dawkins, unlike SJG, does not \\"bend over\\"! SJG is dead and cannot respond. Dawkins similarly puts down scientists, including Freeman Dyson -- not dead but over 90 -- who have accepted the Templeton Prize, calling them phonies and sell-outs. One of Dawkins' \\"jokes\\" depends for its impact on an atheist's resume being *longer* than a believer's (281).<br /><br />Dawkins' cheap bullying makes you want to put him in the corner for a lengthy time-out, and restrict his cookie and juice privileges. His species of arrogance is no friend of scholarship; rather, it's the constant servant of brownshirt obscurantism.<br /><br />Dawkins protests that he doesn't need knowledge of religion to critique it, because, after all, God does not exist. There is a most excellent London Review of Books essay addressing Dawkins' aggressive ignorance: \\"Lunging, Flailing, Mispunching,\\" by Terry Eagleton.<br /><br />Dawkins flaunts his ignorance in his dismissal of Luke's mention of Quirinius (93). I don't have space here to address this -- do a Google search of \\"Luke\\" and \\"Quirinius\\" and you'll see that Dawkins is pulling the wool over his naive atheist flocks' eyes.<br /><br />Religion is persuasive, Dawkins says, \\"to people not used to asking questions\\" (92). This statement is so false, ignorant, or blind I'd let it go without comment, but, who's been asking, \\"Why am I here\\" for the past ten thousand years, except people of faith -- thus, inventing universities, medicine, philosophy, and science? Copernicus, Mendel, Lemaitre - these religious men's questions gave us the heliocentric universe, genetics, and the Big Bang theory. Dawkins, and atheists like him, are smugly certain of their every whim; persons of faith ask all the time.<br /><br />Dawkins divides the world into two mutually exclusive categories: really smart people like him, and everybody else. He dismisses out of hand the fact that many great scientists are or have been believers. He implies that scientists from the past were faking being religious -- they were cowardly liars lacking integrity -- and he implies that his contemporaries who believe in God are bad scientists and \\"embarrassing\\" (99).<br /><br />A chapter entitled \\"Why There Is Almost Certainly No God\\" reports that there can't be a God because evolution directs biological life -- and yet there are evolutionary scientists who are also Christians. As for the anthropic principle, Dawkins argues that any entity that designed physical reality would just be too complex to imagine; so God doesn't exist because Dawkins can't imagine him. Dawkins says that multiple universes cancel out God. There is more evidence for the existence of God than for multiple universes. Dawkins argues against intelligent design; Francis S. Collins does a superior job of arguing against ID in his book, \\"Language of God.\\" Collins is a Christian. So much for that chapter.<br /><br />I could go on, but I don't want to, because this hodgepodge bored me. But this must be mentioned -- Dawkins reveals zero awareness of the impact of his ideas on real people who, unlike him, don't inhabit ivory towers. Ethically, humans are comparable to cows? (297) Parents should not be allowed to teach their children? (326) Tens of millions of innocents were murdered in Germany, Russia, China, Tibet, Cambodia in the real-world implementation of megalomaniacal creeds like Dawkins'. If he knows his, if he cares at all, no awareness of it is shown in this book, which is not so much a deconstruction of God, as it is a hate letter to all of humanity.<br /><br />The most telling line in the entire book may be, \\"wouldn't the designer of the universe have to be a scientist?\\" (104) Wow, Richard, all I can say is, thank you for designing the universe. We've been so mistaken for worshipping anyone but you for the past ten millennia.<br /><br />I did like two things in this book: Dawkins does a beautiful job of explaining why moths fly into flames (172-3). When reading those four paragraphs, I felt like I was reading a different book. An expert was enlightening me in the most elegant, ego-free way possible, on a very basic question. Dawkins also writes, briefly, about having been molested as a child (316).

B000OVLBEY|3.0|There are better comic book adaptations out there - Ghost Rider could have been a great dark movie along the lines of the original Batman.  Instead we got an interesting but not moving story, that had a few great action scenes, but not much unpredictability.  \\"How long do we have to wait until they take the girl as a hostage?\\"    Nicolas Cage's quirky confused style worked better in Lords of War and other movies, but it didn't work here.  In the end you're not convinced he believes what he's saying - it's only as Ghost Rider that the character gains credibility.  On the casating upside, Sam Elliot was made for his role as the Caretaker, and former Easy Rider Peter Fonda was a sly (for lack of a better word) choice as the Devil.      The CD we saw didn't have any extras.  Perhaps the 2 disc set does?

As much as I loved the first one, I think this was even better.  I become very involved with the characters, and besides having a good story I learn alot about the culture of a nation that I knew little about.  I always wondered why we were there and after reading his books it makes alot more sense.  Hopefully there will be a third novel coming out in the future.

B00005JPKE|2.0|Faced with all the rave reviews I didn't write this review until after I re-viewed LFIJ. Seeing it again I came to the same sad conclusions of the first-time through; maybe even more so: I was disappointed; in fact, LFIJ just adds to my irritation of just-released hype phenomenon.    I admire and respect Clint Eastwood and his work; but this flick is superficial, stereotypical, monotonous and trite. I couldn't help comparing it to Terrance Malick's THE THIN RED LINE and Mel Gibson's WE WERE SOLDIERS; both were FAR superior (and highly recommended, especially the Malick film, which depicts Japanese soldiers in-depth and so dramatically, without a hint of soap-operatics and worn seen-before characterizing tricks.)    A baker with the pregnant wife who'd rather be home. A swash-buckling equestrian officer. A brutal sergeant. A noble, professional but family-loving commander, and - Well, ALL the Japanese characters were paper-thin cliche`s whatever their role. The obligatory back stories were oh-so familiar, and again, thin. And the payoffs as each character meets his fate seemed unattached, ambiguous and eminently unrevealing. It was like they tried to go for a moral and lost track of their point. (Yes much of war is pointless, but finding something dramatic and insightful to make that point is what movie art's about, isn't it?) Short form: Nothing in this movie surprised or enlightened me.     The scuttling through caves became monotonous (but I'm sure were big money-savers) and was edited into a numbing, drumming beat than just ran on and on. In all, the whole story-telling seemed flat, without originality or provocation.    My father-in-law, now ending his days in a VA hospital, was at Iwo Jima,  and just saw this movie. He said they got the barren look of the island (atoll?) right. But as to the scenario, he grunted \\"Hollywood\\". 'Bye Harry,  thanks for your daughter. And your right-on one-word review.    Oh, another war movie which dramatizes the characters of war,very early-on, was Samuel Fuller's THE BIG RED ONE; Amazon offers the expanded, once-censored version. It's fine, too. And if you really want a heavy hit of the personalities of wars and warriors, check out BAND OF BROTHERS; its ironies and moral dilemmas are dramatically displayed; again, far better than this cardboard cut-out of a movie.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Quality...If you are a fan of the Alien movies look no further... This is a really cool collection of these movies and I am glad waited to buy this collection... Lots of cool extras and tons of new scenes to watch if you select the directors cuts of each film.     Nice!
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I absolutely loved it. As soon as I recieved I watched the entire first season. The only problem that I have is that in some parts it freezes like from a scratch but it isn't too bad. Love shopping at amazon
B000244EMO|5.0|As a young boy my father approached me and said hey I rented a cool movie want to watch it...I must have been nine or ten at the time...and I said \\"what is it?\\" He said \\"Predator\\"...the excitement that I was experiencing wanted to burst from my very being; it was almost uncontrollable...I couldn't believe it...My mom was out of town and my dad was going to let me watch the holly grail of violence, action and utter cinematic little kid poison. I was not allowed to watch bad movies, that is of course unless mom was out of the house...then dad would buy us junk food and \\"R\\" rated movies...oh...I will never forget Jessie The Body Ventura's Gatling gun...that was the coolest thing ever...and the way the Predator hunted down and killed basically everyone was pure magic.    Aside from my own personal enjoyment and ranting...this is a good movie...Predator is in the top ten of best action movies of all time...There are no complaints here all good and all bad A if you know what I mean.
B00000K3D4|5.0|I have always loved this movie since I was a kid. It's a bit cheesy for an older crowd but it's a good time and has a lot of good songs in it.
B0002XDODU|4.0|I have always been a fan of Rammstein but I must confess that this is actually the first cd I have purchased of theirs. Mostly because I love the song Amerika. The song perfectly captures my sentiments about Globalization and the spread of American consumerism and capitalism.<br />Also, it totally rocks.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|Kelly Clarkson has evolved into an incredible artist.  She wrote/co-wrote all of My December, and her lyrics are incredible.  Her voice soars on the ballads, such as \\"Sober\\" and \\"Be Still.\\"      For Kelly's pop fans, there are a few songs that may replace Since U Been Gone as favorites, including \\"How I Feel\\" and \\"Don't Waste Your Time.\\"  My personal favorites are \\"Judas\\" and \\"Haunted,\\" which really display pure emotion and rock energy...    This is definitely Kelly's most mature and most original album.  The production is very well done and this just may win Kelly a few more Grammys... Best of luck to her, and I'm glad she got to make the album she wanted to.  Clearly, Clive was wrong!
B000N3SS80|1.0|Though her voice is good; she should stick to Pop music.  Too many ballads and the soul searching lyrics.  Lyrics not appropriate for her.  She sings about sadness and disappointment when we all know her life is so different. The songs did not match her or what she represents to Latinos and women.  Jennifer should continue to do Pop music and upbeat tempos and forget about the torch songs of pain and abandonment.  Not a good match.  What were her producers thinking.  Hello!!!! Wasted my money.  I never listen to it again.
B00006879E|5.0|I usually listen to country or classic rock but I had heard a few Maroon 5 songs and liked them. I am so glad I took a chance and bought this CD. All I can say is AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME! They have such a cool, unique sound. I highly recommend this CD.
1596912375|2.0|This is the only William Boyd novel I've read...and I can't even claim that really as I didn't finish it!<br />I persevered to page 109 purely because I hate giving up on a book, but decided I couldn't waste any more of my life on it.  It took me over a week to get that far, so little did I want to pick it up, in contrast to books usually taking me two or three days to complete.<br /><br />Although the language is uncomplicated I found the characters confusing and boring and really didn't care about any of them.  I hate being so negative about a book and maybe if I had have been able to get to the end it would have been worth it, but in my opinion a book should draw you in far quicker if it's worth reading.
B00005JPQT|4.0|like part  3 he's out on the streets all over the place alot of computer hacking, it hought it may of mentiond a little more about his wife and son notjust the daughter,and i felt the plot an special effecs was better than part  3 but still not as godo as  part  1, 2, i thought  bruice was pretty good being  12 years since the last one came out. alot of action and better than part  3 but the plot in 1,2 was still better to me
0316067598|5.0|Trapped in an airport for 12 hours, I tore through this book, cover to cover. Petty Officer Luttrell, of \\"Warrior Elite\\" fame, paints a stirring picture of both the training course of the SEALs and his subsequent harrowing ordeal in the mountains of Afghanistan. The book is fairly unpolished, but in a good way. Luttrell is not a professional writer, and never pretends to be. His style might best be described as a kind of \\"stream of consciousness.\\" While he never looses his story, he interjects many side stories along the way. This, however, does not detract from the book in any way, and is a refreshing change from the emotionally bereft novels which seem to be so common place. Read Dick Couch's \\"Warrior Elite\\" and \\"The Finishing School\\" first, and then sit down with this great tome for dessert.
B000QFAJ7S|4.0|Kelly's new CD is definitely not a retread of \\"Break Away,\\" and the teenage pop songs are totally MIA on the new disc.  Therein lies the biggest problem with the disc:  It is just not a very enjoyable listen.  There are no light and breezy sing-along-songs to be found, and the artist's anger, depression, and bitterness cuts through every track with a vengeance that has the potential to suck the life out of the listener.  THAT SAID... this CD is VERY, VERY, VERY WELL DONE.  It is absolutely top-knotch as far as artisty goes and probably deserves FIVE STARS in that regard.  I believe fans will either love this disc or absolutely hate it, and Kelly stands to both lose a lot of loyal fans who have enjoyed her earlier recordings and to gain new ones who like the edgier, more mature Clarkson.  I repeat:  it is EXCELLENT, yet DIFFERENT...
B000OYC3J8|2.0|I've been a big fan of the White Stripes from day one and I've liked all their albums so far (yes, even Get Behind Me Satan) but after three listens, I'm disappointed by this one. Where the White Stripes self-imposed restrictions used to work for them previously, it works against them this time. Jack tries to be more ambitious in his songs but find himself stuck within his own formula. Meg's limitations are more evident than ever and it's obvious that she can't keep up anymore. Jack still has the talent but it sounds like the White Stripes have run their course. Find yourself a band and a real drummer Jack and come back to us.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I love it! It doesn't go into as much detail as the first Pride and Prejudice[[ASIN:B00005MP58 Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E, 1996)]] ,then again that was five hours long,and some of the best scences weren't even in the book but whats wrong with that. There are some fantastic scences, spectacular scenery, and Pride and Prejudice is one of the few movies where you are worried if they are really going to get together so it keeps you attention the entire time Knightly plays Elizabeth beautifully and Matthew Macfadyen is the perfect Mr. Darcy. Pride and Prejudice definitly didn't recieve the explosure it deserved.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|Sure, it's not the same old sappy-snappy-pop that we have shoved into our ears daily, but it is a very well crafted collection of rock songs that show off Kelly's range and maturity as a songwriter and artist.  Good for her!  This had better earn her the BIG respect she deserves, if not only for taking a chance and puting out the album that SHE wanted to do.<br /><br />Being a big fan of Kelly's since note-one all the negative hype really had me worried, but I was so pleasantly surprised! With the exception of maybe \\"Judas\\" (which will probably grow on me) I instantly took to every track on this album.  I know that \\"Sober\\" is going to be a huge hit, as well it should be.<br /><br />I think the 'powers that rule the music industry' just didn't like the idea of not being able to put out 5 or 6 radio singles and line their pockets, but this is a great album that should do well on it's own.<br /><br />I think that the listening public is ready to make better music choices than just what is played on the radio (because the same 10 songs--that all sound alike-- every day all day just don't cut it anymore)
B000G03Q2S|5.0|This version of \\"Pet Sounds\\" is a real treat for fans; the fuzzy green packaging is very sturdily built and is nice to the touch although it remains to be seen how well it will stand the elements over time.  As to the discs themselves if you already have a mono and a stereo version of the album then the cd will be nothing new for you.  I have never been a fan of duplicating albums with both mono and stereo versions on one disc but for me as I only had a mono version prior to this version, I didn't mind getting this for the stereo version and especially for the DVD 5.1 surround version.  What I didn't like was that \\"Trombone Dixie\\" is missing and it was on the Dutch version of the stereo version that I used to have years ago.<br /><br />The dvd has some promo videos and candid interviews with members of the band and especially of Brian Wilson but the sound quality of the DVD Dolby Surround is truly fantastic.  You just end up hearing sounds that you didn't know were there when you were just listening to the cd.  It's made me decide to forego the cds and to go straight for the DVD whenever I want to listen to the album.  For this reason alone I'd say go get this version unless they end up just releasing the DVD in an mlps format the way they have just done with U2's \\"Rattle and Hum\\".  If they do that in the future, I'd say go and get that if you already have the cd.  Oh yeah, and they really should include \\"Trombone Dixie\\" in addition the \\"Hang On to Your Ego\\" that they included with the cd but not with the dvd as well as the other outtake sounds that were part of the bonus tracks that were released in the 1991 stereo version.
0385658605|4.0|It helps to already be a Bryson fan, but if you are new to the joys of reading his books, settle in, and enjoy.  Bryson has been an outsider himself, having lived in England for many years.  He moved back to the USA after two decades, tried it for a while, and moved back to England.  He knows about being a stranger in a strange land.  When he makes observation on the eccentricities, endearing qualities, advantages, and frustrating foibles of the places he visits (including those in the USA),  he does it with humor, intelligence, a satirical bent, a very precise eye,insight--and did I say, humor?  You will laugh out loud at least once.  The paperback is inexpensive, the enjoyment immense.

B000002GKT|5.0|I'm 53. I love the \\"classics\\", and this group's live effort ranks as one of the best I have ever heard. And it places you right there in the audience as if you were on the first row. And by the end, with I Don't Need No Doctor, you've felt the weight of 4 master performers just smack you all over the stage, your're wet from sweat, tired from dancing, clapping, and screaming your lungs out. Gilded Splinter and Rolling Stone (which each took up one side of vinyl) are great. The first song, which challenges you to ask yourself...Are You Ready?, sets the stage for an excellent concert ride.  When given the chance to discuss classic rock with someone much younger than me, I always say....buy Performance, Rockin' the Filmore, and be a witness to what 4 guys on stage can do, and that is play some of the best live music you will ever hear on this planet....but, that's just my opinon, along with the other 50 plus reviewers on this site. BUY IT!!    JLMankin
0792839749|5.0|THE ITEM ARRIVED IN GREAT CONDITION ALTHOUGH SLOW IN DELIVERY.  CANNOT SEE THE FILM I ORDERED BECAUSE IT IS FOR REGION 1 AND I NEED FILMS FOR REGION 2.  REALISED WHEN I PUT THE DVD ON.  MY MISTAKE. RATED 5 STARS BECAUSE OF THE WAY IT WAS PACKED.
B0000549B0|5.0|It was sent to me in a timely manner. The movie is the best. No problems at all.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|The thing that many people do not understand is that YOU DO  NOT HAVE TO BE A FAN OF THE SHOW TO LOVE THIS MOVIE.  This has everything you wish Lucas had provided in the prequels:  great acting, kicking action, moving characters, and a great plot.  The feel is gritty but with great heart.  He has a message but will not preach to you.  Surprises, love and a message about humanity make it complete. If you ever wished you could find a Sci-Fi movie on the big screen that you could love, do yourself a favor and give this movie a try.  You will not go away unmoved.
B000PFUA9G|5.0|I have gone through my CD collection and the country CD's out number anything else, guess I like something about it.  I can say CD's like this one are the REASON I do like country music!!  Great CD, and it is always a plus when you listen to a CD straight through.    We saw Brad in concert and he sang \\"I'm Still A Guy.\\"  I looked forward to this CD coming out for that song!  Letter to Me is also a great song!
B000PFU7OO|5.0|Unsurprisingly, John Carney's intimate 2007 boy-meets-girl musical, [[ASIN:B00005JPRT Once]], has spawned an accompanying soundtrack disc. The nice surprise, however, is that a closer listen to the music yields even more dividends than the already rewarding movie itself. Similar to recent releases by David Gray and Damien Rice, a halting emotionalism and hopeful yearning informs many of the songs here but not at the expense of a certain pop sensibility that is both immediate and passionate. Most of the credit belongs to the film's two stars, Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute; and especially the Frames' Glen Hansard, who either jointly or individually composed all the tracks except one, Fergus O'Farrell's \\"Gold\\", a guitar-strummed jig played by the Irish band Interference and marked by a mournful violin.<br /><br />One of the most accomplished songs on the album, the Beatlesque \\"Lies\\" transitions through a variety of emotions from poignant hesitation to cruel revelation with an unerring fluidity guided by Hansard's near-falsetto. For a marked change of pace, \\"Fallen from the Sky\\" provides syncopated pop fluff backed by the Frames' seamless harmonies, while \\"Trying to Pull Myself Away\\" carries a propulsive beat over a catchy, string-laden groove. True to the onscreen portrayal of a busker, the melancholic bitterness of \\"Leave\\", the more pensive \\"All the Way Down\\", and the primal desperation of \\"Say It to Me Now\\" rely solely on Hansard's searing vocal and guitar. Evoking Bj&ouml;rk's plaintive but touching vocal style, the Czech Republic-born Irglov&aacute; shines on the forlorn ballad, \\"The Hill\\", and especially on the Gallic-sounding, otherworldly \\"If You Want Me\\" backed by Hansard's aching voice.<br /><br />Yet for all those choice cuts, the most magical moments aurally come when Hansard and Irglov&aacute; duet, the same as in the film - the haunting title tune, the searing confessional of \\"When Your Mind's Made Up\\" punctuated by Graham Hopkins' persistent drums, and in particular, the shimmering beauty the co-stars achieve on the breakout hit, \\"Falling Slowly\\", which works off a simple sing-song structure (akin to \\"Fr&egrave;re Jacques\\") and then builds powerfully into its heartbreaking chorus. It's no coincidence that the song represents the film's defining moment, an emotionally transcendent scene when the characters bond musically in a piano shop. There is such an unforced beauty with the music presented here that I find the entire disc irresistible and a perfect reflection of the unbridled and sometimes pained romanticism that the movie was trying to achieve.rs achieve on the breakout hit, \\"Falling Slowly\\", which works off a simple sing-song structure (akin to \\"Frère Jacques\\") and then builds powerfully into its heartbreaking chorus.

B0000AUHPB|5.0|Terrific Brit movie starring Michael Caine.  Apparently one of the most popular Brit movies ever.  Mini Cooper enthusiasts will really like it.  The recent remake is also worth having.

B000QFAJ7S|4.0|Clive Davis' discontent with the music material, underwhelming concert ticket sales, management team getting fired - these are just some of the activities of the media circus that has preceded the release of Kelly Clarkson's third studio effort, \\"My December.\\" What confuses me more than anything is the title - honestly, what the hell is that supposed to mean? Is this the definitive album that COMPLETELY separates Kelly Clarkson from her \\"Americal Idol\\" past? Are times like Christmas defined by emotional conflicts and activities that involve getting even with trashy ex-boyfriends? Whatever the title means is probably a completely different matter - it's about the music, and \\"My December\\" is, unsurprisingly, Kelly Clarkson's best album to date.    While \\"My December\\" is far from some kind of radical departure from her signature Pop-Rock sound, it's a welcome step forward in terms of artistry and it slightly diversifies the former American Idol winner's musical palette. Although Kelly Clarkson had a hand in the songwriting process of every track on the album, much of the album's grit, energy and emotion are drawn from the singer's powerful and emotional set of pipes and the production provided by the likes of David Kahne. Generally, the album's dark vibe, which lacks much of the commercial sheen that - in retrospect - tainted her sophomore album \\"Breakaway\\", is strongly reminiscent of \\"Jagged Little Pill\\"-era Alanis Morissette. Although I'm in disagreement with Clive Davis' disliking of the album material, I can see where he's coming from. There's nothing on the album that sticks in your head nearly as long or as effectively as \\"Since U Been Gone\\", Kelly Clarkson's signature smash hit, and some songs, like lead single \\"Never Again\\", often have more scathing lyrics and emotion (\\"I hope the ring you gave to her turns her finger green / I hope when you're in bed with her, you think of me\\") at the expense of addictive hooks.     The few songs that do screw themselves intoyour head without much effort make up some of the best moments on the album - \\"One Minute\\" is a ridiculously infectious slice of Electro-Pop; and \\"Yeah\\" is a slice of Funk-Rock-Pop that mixes madly passionate vocals with a head-smacking-ly catchy chorus, horn/guitar production and some lightly provocative sexual innuendo. Nonetheless, there are still plenty of other great moments too - \\"Sober\\" is an exceptionally beautiful ballad, exposing Kelly Clarkson's vocals in their most vulnerable form as she contemplates overcoming her fear and problems (no, it's not alcoholism) over beautifully arranged instrumentation; \\"Judas\\", said to be one of her more personal songs, lacks significant lyrical exposure, but is easily one of the most emotionally driven songs on the album; \\"Irvine\\" is a vocally ethereal, acoustic guitar-driven ballad number; and \\"Haunted\\" easily conjures thoughts of Evanescence, living up to its title in every aspect as Kelly Clarkson urges for her lover over quick-paced, time-is-ticking guitar strums, percussion, spooky strings and a power-driven chorus.    While there's no material on this album that screams \\"filler\\", several songs clearly stand out over others (by the time the album's finished, I completely forgot how \\"Can I Have A Kiss\\" & \\"Maybe\\" sounded like). And that's the problem that could potentially ruin this album - it lacks Pop appeal, so absorbed in its emotional exploration and creative abandon that I (and Clive Davis) won't be surprised if this album doesn't match up to \\"Breakaway\\" in terms of sales. Nonetheless, \\"My December\\" is Kelly Clarkson's best and most personal album to date. 4.5 stars!    5 Best Tracks (IMO) (In No Order):  \\"One Minute\\"  \\"Yeah\\"  \\"Sober\\"  \\"Judas\\"  \\"Irvine\\"
B000MR1V22|3.0|It was an alright movie; however, that ending was not what I expected it to be for a movie entitled \\"Little Miss Sunshine,\\" because there was no \\"Sunshine\\" in the end.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Although I believed the A&E version could never be replaced in my heart due to its true-to-the-book writing, this is a wonderful sweetened condensed version and sparks a great romantic chord.  Though I still adore the A&E version and would recommend it to anyone who's never read the book or is, like myself, a purist, this is a great little flick.
B000M5AJQS|3.0|This movie is great if you have about two hours to pay close attention. Compared to Goodfellas among other ganster movies it is a modern version. The cast is full of familiar faces and interesting swirls of how the individual characters connect. At the end your jaw will be in your lap!! You will not believe this ending! It's worth buying just to have in your collection, but even more so just to see the ending!!

Worth the money!
B00000K3D4|4.0|If you love magic and fairytales this is the movie for you! Granted it is a bit older, but David Bowie plays a great role and sings you into this magical world.  I had never seen it and bought it because he was in it.  My stepmother loves him too so of course I bought her a copy.  If you have young ones or are just young at heart this is the movie for you!!!
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I bought the box set as a gift for my boyfriend, and he was really pleased with it. The box is strong enough to have the DVDs, the booklet is very useful, and also when you play a DVD in you computer a software from WB can be installed automatically so you can watch the episodes using that program. Regarding the quality of the DVDs, I have no complaints, the image is good, the sound too, plus you have different language subtitles to practice with. And one more thing, I was afraid that the box would be delived to me practically in pieces because of the shipment period (two weeks and a bit more)and because of some review I read, but it was in perfect conditions. You should definitely buy this Product!
B000A7DVR2|5.0|If you like movies that won't make you think too hard but still have a great plot line, this is the movie for you! I saw this movie back when it came out and I watch it all the time! If you want to laugh this is a great mindless movie!  It is chalk full of loveable characters! And you will be intreged by the twists this seemingly silly movie has.  By the end you will want to stand up and applaud! It is a GREAT movie! Instant classic! Great investment, and even better to add to your top 10 movie favorites!
B000NA2348|5.0|I honestly think the Dolby mix listening experience depends on the type of fidelity system one has.  I do agree with the previous poster that certain instruments really are much too loud on several of the songs, but I found the backup singers coming out of the rear channels to be really something else.  The songs featuring string arrangements are especially compelling with Bowies' vocals centered, background singers in the rear and the orchestration lushly swirling around seemingly from everywhere.  I don't know if Dolby DTS makes this sound better, but that's the scheme that I use to listen to just about everything, including this (I just prefer DTS over 5.1).  Aside from the occasionally loud bass drum or percussion instrument, I just haven't found any deal breaking faults like the prior reviewer has.  No disrespect to his opinions, but I guess people just hear things differently.<br /><br />The five star rating is for the total package of this latest re-issue.  The CD version of the mixes is outstanding, the Dolby disc while not drop dead essential, is nice enough to have.  The Dick Cavett interview and the musical performances are both really very interesting archival things.  Yeah they've been floating around forever as bootlegs, but now's your chance to get it legitimately.  The liner notes are also excellent, tracing the path of the album itself and the Bowie timeline of events that surrounded this recording (like found on the Ziggy, Aladin and Diamond Dogs reissues).<br /><br />So in short, no don't buy this if you're happy with whatever version of YA you have.  But if you do have the cash to burn then by all means indulge yourself.<br /><br />Young Americans was and still is, a great great album.
B000FP2OPY|4.0|Television series are great to invest in, especially if you don't have the time to watch them when they're on tv, or if you don't own TiVo.
B00005JPQT|4.0|It's hard to believe that the first Die Hard movie came out almost 20 years ago, but Bruce Willis, still playing the indelible, indestructible action icon with 100% credibility, is sure to appeal to not only those who saw the R-rated flick on the big screen originally, but also to the post-adolescents who will pay their own way into this 2007 PG-13 thrill ride.<br /><br />Detective John McClane has what he thinks is the easy job of bringing a geeky hacker named Matt Farrell (Justin Long) into headquarters for questioning in connection with a cyber-terrorist attack, but as it turns out the scruffy young man is himself a target -- and so begins the first of dozens of explosions.<br /><br />Which is a good thing. Live Free or Die Hard is everything a fan of the franchise can expect, and more. In spite of a clunky title and some rather tired genre clich&eacute;s, it's obvious that Willis is having a great time reprising his role and he still looks the part. The world-weary wisecracker has a worthy opponent in disgruntled government security specialist Thomas Gabriel (Deadwood's Timothy Olyphant), and a believable buddy vibe with the fresh-faced kid who can crack any code.<br /><br />The acting is satisfactory, the dialogue is decent, and the set up is suspenseful -- but it really is all about the stunts, and they do not disappoint. Some of the more elaborate action sequences bring to mind Rube Goldberg on steroids, with McClane channeling Wile E. Coyote. For those concerned about the watered-down rating from previous installments, there is a colossal body count, clever swear-skirting, and no shortage of gunfire. It may not have a gratuitous scene in a strip club or the famous cowboy line, but Live Free or Die Hard does fill the bill as the must-see popcorn flick of the summer.
0783225482|4.0|I loved this movie! I hadn't seen it in years but what a funny movie to look back on.  Great investment into a movie collection.
B00005JPQT|4.0|I just went to see the preview of the movie last night. The movie has a lot of action and special effects. I like the scene on the expressway. This is the best scene in the whole movie.  The plot is kind of boring and the sequence of the movie as a part III of the  Die Hard series is kind of obsolete. The FBI, NSA, Secret Service, any government agency, they look like dumb or stupid. They are portrait in the movie that they do not know what is going on or they do not know what to do.  I will personally wait until it comes out on DVD. Movie sequels are getting boring now.
B00000JPH6|2.0|This movie I bought because I had never seen it. If you don't mind squaking bird sounds and nails on a chalkboard- than go for it. I had a headache half way through. This movie has more noise than dialogue.

0061020710|4.0|I love Terry Pratchett's work.  I had read a number of Discworld books and decided to go back to the beginning to find all of the characters.  While this one isn't entirely up to his best later in the series it is still funny and the characters are still a hoot.  I think if you start here you'll like it even better.

Connelley has moved Bosch back to traditional homicide investigation and it's what he does best.  Also, he's back in conflict with authority figures and impatient with ignorance and stupidity within the LA Police Department.

B000OT6UZQ|5.0|Sarah Michelle Gellar playing the bad guy.....yummy.  So used to her as the heroin and now to see her portray a sizzling and seductive character.  In my eyes, she can do no wrong.  And now, this tantalizing twisted flick hits the high-def arena, I jumped to see Gellar in all her glory.  Sony's recent blu-ray releases are blessed with all the bells and whistles and spares no expense in providing them on dual-layer disks.  The picture looks fabulous and included an uncompressed 5.1 PCM track to my listening pleasure.  All I can say is, sit back and enjoy the ride.

B000OYC3J8|2.0|This band hit their peak with Elephant, but ever since I feel like Jack has been tossing us gimmicks to keep albums coming out.  He has run out of riffs and song writing ideas on this one.  This sounds like a parody of the White Stripes.  Personally, I'm tired of bands trying too hard to make an album sound like it came out in 1969.  Be original, move ahead, and try something new.  I can't wait for all the 19 year old kids who are about to start a new music revolution.  We all need it badly because garage rock has seen better days.  What a boring album.
1932100660|5.0|I read it. I thought about what I had read, and decided to reread it to make sure I remembered it correctly. I bought the logic of the book all the way. I have changed the way I eat. Now I feel better. I lost weight. I even began a regular exercise program. I purchased 5 more of the books and gave them to everyone I care about. They have changed the way they eat.  Reciently my wife even gave one to our Doctor.     The book is easy reading and I recomend it to anyone who cares about their health enough to seriously try to improve it.
B00005ASOI|1.0|I must not be a fan of the old Italian thrillers. I read reviews from others about this movie, and thought it was just what I was looking for. Boy was I wrong. You can't hear the characters whispering unless you crank up the volume, then the music comes blaring in. You never see the murderous beast in the first attack, just a hairy arm with long talon-like fingernails, yet when the beast kills the female victim, it repeatedly stabs her with a knife.?? Then there's the scene where the seeing-eye dog attacks it's master. It knocks him down and supposedly tears his throat out, but when you see a close up of the dog ripping at flesh, the flesh is attached to something below the letterbox frame of the film. You never see a body with the live dog. Not to mention the stuffed dog's head that the blind guy is wrestling with on the ground. Too fake for my liking. The girls spend a lot of time staring into nothingness, and listening to haunting sounds that you cannot hear, and you are left staring at them until something else happens. Sometimes for several minutes. They have one bikini scene that's not really worth mentioning. Not sexy, not thrilling, not scary, not horrifying. Someone wrote, \\"The only thing scarier than the last 17 minutes of this film, are the first 80 minutes\\". Unless you are really into weak thrillers, and cheesy effects, don't waste your time on this movie.

B000PHX8C0|5.0|they are back, and it is frikkin awesome!  they had their first album, which was great but has been said to be a bit rough around the edges, then their second \\"sophmore\\" release, which many bands sometime rise and fall by, and DD clearly progressed and refined their sound, and now we are brought to their third album.  the first thing that struck me that there was a definite progression in their music, but yet still retains the same aggression and edge you'd expect from their previous release.  as Fury was more polished then their first album, Last Kind Words is still more refined, better riffs, better arrangement, while still grabbing you by the back of the head and slamming your cranium into the wall.      Even Dez's trademark \\"cookie monster\\" vocals (which i hate using that term, but don't know how else to describe it) is even further developed on this album.    If you are a DevilDriver fan..........then you're probably not even reading this and already have it...........    if you are a metal fan, this is the epitome of the current state of metal done at its finest.    the best analogy i can give to this album is looking at Metallica's first 3 studio releases, same feeling, same sound, just kept getting better and better.    hands down, a must buy, period
B000NVIXDW|5.0|Frank Sinatra's crooners shoes aren't easy ones to fill, but Buble is probably the only contender who comes close to matching Old Blue Eyes for style and delivery. This latest album delivers what it promises.
B000031XCR|5.0|For me, this is easy. I've always loved Celine so for me, she can do no wrong. For some, the CD may not contain their favorites, but how can you put them all on one CD? There's not a bad, or even so-so song on the disc. Love it!
B000065BPB|5.0|Sennheiser is one of the standards for testing in the hearing sciences and these can be found much cheaper than some of the other models (I got mine for $79 a pair) but recent testing in my lab as well as long-time listening verifies that these are very linear up to 104 dB and very flat in the range of most speech and music.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|Absolutely amazing! The Director's cut is like an entirely new movie!! It doesn't matter what faith you claim, this movie does not choose sides. Truly one for the shelves.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|Wow! They did it again. This is another great album from Rush. Once again I was blown away by their musical abilities and the technical proficincy each of them display with their instruments. I love the song \\"Hope\\" written by Alex Lifeson. I highly recommend this album.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|I love me some great no-brainer pop fun! But if youre expecting that from Miss Clarkson's December, you'll be confused at first, BUT then you wont be able to stop listening to this tour de force of an album.  With all the hype about this album being non-commercial with no hits, i was eager to hear what all the fuss was about, and finally be able to make my own judgements.  At first listen, i was thinking - where are the since-youve-been-gones, the catchy hooks, and singalong scorchers!? But then i listened again, and again, and again, and more and more i started to fall in love with the album.   I felt like it was my best friend that made the record, put her everything into it, and i was compelled to listen to it.   With many poprecords you LOVE them at first, and listen to them over and over, but then after a couple of weeks you tire of them and move on to the next best thing. Its the other way around with December, i like it more with every listen. Im not really a rock music fan, but for some reason, i love this. I dont know, maybe its because im a sucker for any underdog story, but could that really make me love an album.  The album feels like a relationship, there are highs and lows, there are struggles, and sometimes certain things that you didnt like, turn out to be the  things that made you love her in the first place, all in all it feels like theres a bond between you and Kelly after listening to her confessions.   Goin through some tracks, i love Never Again, hardcore pop, similar to \\"since\\" for me; One Minute is one of the best on the album, brilliantly put together, a happy-sad banger that makes u wanna dance! Hole only grabbed me after the fifth listen, now i cant get enough, love the anger! Sober is gonna win a grammy, what an awesome song, the last minute is chilling! Dont waste your time is such a singalong-er, great melody, Judas is also one of my favourites, simple yet so catchy. Haunted is very raw, personal, eerie and powerful. Have to say the first part of the album is the best for me, although im sure many people will have it the other way around. On the rest of the album, Kelly seems to become more melancholic, quite and sweet in a way. Be Still is a touching ballad, with interesting instrumentation, Maybe builds up to be a declaration of independance, listen to those lyrics; How I Feel and Yeah are my least favourite, they just feel a bit out of place and disjointed to me, but still good songs. Can I Have a kiss is awesome, you just wanna play the air-guitar with this one. Irvine is the most amazing sung prayer ive ever heard, its so real, you can almost hear her on the floor, hopeless, singing this cry for help and relevance. Chivas is cute hiding at the back of the album.   One thing i think might have worked though, is if she kept all the songs, but maybe produced them a little differently. All the songs sound very raw and and almost unplugged to me. I think with more of a pop production on the album with these amazing songs, she would have sold even more than Breakaway. A while back, a different, more pop, version of Haunted leaked, and it was absolutely brilliant, same song, just more user-friendly. Maybe she just wanted to be more raw, and maybe it does suite the album and songs better, maybe she is looking to gain some more street-cred, willing to shed some of the pop fans, for the sake of artistic growth. i just like my pop, as i said in the beginning.   With all its oddeties, and anger, there's a great big heart beating inside of it. I love this album. Hats of to you Kelly, youre one of the best artists out there right now.

B000P2A24W|3.0|I have been a Bon Jovi fan since the beginning and still want to hear them rock the house; so I was very skeptical buying this album but thought, well, I've bought every other one, I should buy this one, too.  This was also influenced by the single 'Make a Memory' - once I heard that song, I was really intrigued and thought, we'll maybe it will be good.  I just got it the other day and have listened to it non-stop.  Yessirree Bob, they have gone country but I was pleasantly surprised overall.  And, 'Summertime' seems like a great, feel good, arena shaken track.  I also really dig 'Lost Highway' it will also go over well in the live performance setting.  There are two songs on the album that I could really do WITHOUT and those are 'we got it goin' on' and 'I love this Town'.  My lord, if anyone ever told me I would hear the boys from NJ singing the lyrics \\"we'll be bangin and sangin like the rollin stones\\" I would have fell over and have since done so.  It is a sad attempt at commercial pop rock country that really does not do credit to BJs deep musical or lyrical talent.  Same thing for \\"this town\\" - I appreciate them writing it for what I imagine is in the live arena setting saying they feel at home in 'this town' wherever there fans are but it just falls short.  Overall, though, I was very impressed and it continues to grow on me.  I don't know what their shows will look like in the future, but I'll give it a go!

B000H0MKGK|5.0|John Mayer's third studio release (following Room For Squares and Heavier Things) is hands down his best release by far!    Mayer moves more towards a bluesier sound on this album than any of previous releases with the exception of (Trio). The lead off track and single \\"Waiting for the World to Change\\" has this feel. The song has anti cable news network feel as evident in the line \\"when when you trust your television, what you get is what you got cause when they own the information they can bend it all they want.\\" Is Mayer paranoid here or is he tired of Fox News' \\"fair and balanced\\" tagline?    The following track, I DONT TRUST MYSELF (WITH LOVING YOU) show cases Mayer's amazing guitar talent. He really leans toward the blues guitar throughout the entire album. Roy Hargrove's horns really push this track into the blues. Another fine Mayer track and some outstanding guitar work.    BELIEF is the next track and is a song with anti war message in it. This evident in lines like \\"We're never gonna win the world. We're never gonna stop the war\\", \\"What puts a hundred thousand children in the sand? Belief can,\\" and \\"What puts the folded flag inside his mother's hand? Belief can\\" Mayer's guitar again has a blues riff in this uptempo track. One of my favorites.    GRAVITY is the next song and single off of this record. Once again, fantastic guitar playing in a blues key. The lyrics here are really quite clever. Is he talking about the gravity on the planet or a person named gravity? Could go either way!     The rest of the songs on this album are fantastic! VULTURES is a great song with some fine Fender Rhodes and organ work from Ricky Peterson. This track could easily be another single. In fact most of the tracks on this record be singles!     My absolute favorite track on the album is \\"SLOW DANCING IN A BURNING ROOM\\". This song is clearly about the end of a relationship with a woman. The lyrics are once again top notch Mayer. But again its the guitar work that shines on this track. Mayer pulls the guitar lick on this track that really sounds like the guitar is weeping! It \\"sets the mood\\" for this track. Its John Mayer at his best!    Steve Jordan's drum work and Pino Palladino's bass playing on this album really compliment Mayers guitar work. The make a tight group. Its obvious that their work on the \\"Trio\\" album set the stage for Mayer to hook up with these two guys on this album. The musicianship on this album is tight and top notch.     In summary, I can not recommend this album enough. Mayer has clearly matured most notably in his guitar work and also in his lyrics and subject matter. Mayer is really on track to be a great guitarist. It will be interesting to see what he comes up with over then 10 years or so.    GET THIS ALBUM, YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!
6305907145|5.0|I really like this movie. Of all the versions out there, this one is my favorite.
B0002946M2|3.0|I do a lot of field work across the world and have heard nothing but good things about these sandles - however for me, I can't even wear them. After 1 month, they just stank. Now, I don't have particularly smelly feet. And can't smell any other shoes, but these are bad. Others people with the same shoes tell me that as well (although they still like them). And I found them fairly uncomfortable. I remember that Teva's sandles, when they first came out, also smelled, and then they made them different. Oh, well.
B000002UB3|5.0|'Abbey Road' is the last Beatles album, although 'Let It Be' was released afterwards. After all these years and listening to this record on vinyl, I got to say this is one of the best sounding albums of all time. Despite the fact that sound quality technology has been refined over the last 40 years, no one could do it better then the Beatles.<br />\\"Come Together\\" begans this album and always has been one of my Top favorite Beatle songs. Another favorite and beginning side two is \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" which I believe is George Harrison's best song out of all of the fab fours catalog. One of his best loved songs.<br />Sure, there are rather silly songs like Paul's \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" (which I truly enjoyed growing up, still do) and Ringo's \\"Octopus' Garden\\" - but I believe these songs add surrealism and fun to one of The Beatles' best.<br />'Abbey Road' truly is the last Great Beatles album. The band with this release provides a very cohesive sound, working together, although they were on the verge of splitting up.<br />Ringo Starr's drumming is at his best on this record, especially on tracks like \\"Oh! Darling\\" and \\"The End\\"<br />To me, 'Abbey Road' sounds Worlds ahead of 'Let It Be'-which is still a great album. On 'Let It Be' is the album that the Fab Four sound like independent members, rather then what they do best - working together.<br />- A perfect end to the World's Greatest pop band.
0792838068|5.0|I watched this movie for the first time last night. While digesting my own impressions, I decided to see what others have thought and so hopped onto Amazon. Reading other reviews today out of curiosity, I am struck by the repeated assertions that this is a mutual love story of Shakespearian proportions.<br /><br />To me, this love story is entirely one-sided.<br /><br />When we first meet Sera, she seems very much like a high-priced 'call-girl' who commands hundreds for her services. She describes being routinely abased and abused on the 'job,' but asserts that she's in control. Then we meet her boyfriend/pimp, from whose abuse she has already fled once only to be tracked down. Despite Sera's self-delusion that she's in charge and living a good life, we see evidence of despair and hopelessness as she not only submits to her pimps degradation, but even tries to defend it.<br /><br />When she encounters Ben, who is introduced as an incredibly self-aware and self-destructive alocholic, it is his treatment of her as a person that finally reveals her own despair to herself. He doesn't want sex--in a touching and rare moment of lucidity, Ben recognizes his own lonliness and will pay a 'hooker' to talk to him for an hour. Sera ends up staying the whole night. With the pimp conveniently killed a few scenes later (my only quibble with the plot in general), Sera decides to 'rescue' Ben. The only problem is, he refuses to be rescued and bluntly demands that she can not ask him to stop, or he will leave.<br /><br />We know from the outset that Ben won't stop drinking, he doesn't want to stop. Indeed, it seems his body is so enthralled that he can't stop. We see fewer and fewer moments where he is in command of his senses and actions, his compulsive need to drink just to stay conscious--and yet the incredible volumes of alcohol frequently rendering him incoherent--providing a tragic paradox. He drinks to live and lives to drink.<br /><br />Sera watches his downward spiral, at first enabling in the guise of acceptance, but then with increasing distress. No matter how she tries, she can't break through. At one point she has to douse herself with alcohol to break through his drunken self-absorption, and even that ends in failure as he staggers, falls, and injures himself. Towards the end she begs him to see a doctor, the only time that comes close to her actually breaking her promise about not asking him to stop. And he refuses.<br /><br />Sera admits that she's 'using him,' and I think that could be true. In saving Ben from himself, Sera finds a purpose in her own meaningless life. But as her failure to reach him becomes more obvious and his selfish course continues unabated, we see Sera's self-confidence waver. We see criticism from others that at the start wouldn't even have registered, now pummeling her. A new despair sets in as Sera realizes Ben can't be saved despite her love, because he doesn't love himself.<br /><br />And while he says he loves her, he can't pull himself out of the bottle enough to really feel anything at all. Their last moments together are tragic and quiet.<br /><br />To say that I 'enjoyed' this film is not the right word. I am haunted by it. I see redemption, somewhat, but only in Sera's character and not really enough to save her. The two lead actors are outstanding. Nicholas Cage is utterly convincing and revolting as a drunk. Elisabeth Shue brings out a curious combination of dignity and helplessness in her protrayal of Sera, the more sympathetic of the two characters. A haunting film, to be sure, but not an enjoyable one.wnward spiral, at first enabling in the guise of acceptance, but then with increasing distress. No matter how she tries, she can't break through.

B000002LVB|4.0|Loaded, is the Velvet Underground's fourth and final studio recording.<br />Released in September 1970, one month after Lou Reed calls it quits and begans solo work. Maureen Tucker is absent from 'Loaded' out on maternity leave. \\"Oh Mo, where did you go?\\" - The VU really should have waited.<br />By now, new bassist Doug Yule took over as lead vocalist on far too many tracks. Yes, the band was on the edge of breaking up.<br /> Despite all of this, as always The Velvets still produce a fantastic album.<br />'Loaded' is the VU's most commercially accessible and the band finally signed onto a major label. Although like their earlier lps - 'Loaded' didn't sell very well.<br /> This last album does contain some really wonderful tunes. Includes : the fun, rollicking track \\"Rock & Roll\\" and \\"Sweet Jane\\" - the guitar bursts on \\"Head Held High\\" although it may sound like a repetitive generic rock song by many. My personal favorite track, the opener : \\"Who Loves the Sun\\"-<br />Although much more direct and different then earlier outputs, which of course can be a good thing. This album features one of the VU's biggest stinkers = \\"Lonesome Cowboy Bill\\" a country hillbilly type of Rock sound that Lou Reed never should have attempted.<br />-Loaded- does complete the Velvet Underground's Rock legacy. An end to a highly influential rock band as Reed and Morrison experimented with alternate tunings and fuzzy noise later copied by future bands. -<br /> Such followers (many are favorites of mine) who were influenced by the Velvet Underground include CAN, Television, The Fall, the Dream Syndicate, Pavement, R.E.M. and continuing the New York no-wave tradition: Sonic Youth.
B00005JMK0|5.0|this is one of the greatest movies ever and I can't believe that it is still not out on DVD in the year 2007!!! Please also write reviews on this matter and vote for 'our' reviews so that this movie will be released hopefully sooooonn!!! Thanks!! \\"Together in Electric Dreams...\\"  :)
B000001ESJ|5.0|Although I am a new fan to RUSH I do believe with this album 'A Farewell to Kings' is where the band started to reach their Musical peak along with their next 'Hemispheres'. Before \\"A Farewell..\\" RUSH released '2112' and I don't think it compares to 'A Farewell to Kings' at all. This one has more matured songwriting.<br />I say that I am a new fan because years ago I never cared for Geddy Lee's voice. I remember turning the Radio off or changing the station when a song like \\"Tom Sawyer\\" from 'Moving Pictures' came on.<br />Over time and with recent purchases I have learned to appreciate Geddy Lee's incredible vocals. No one sings like this guy. I now think he truly does have an amazing voice.<br /> The first two songs on 'A Farewell to Kings' are pure classics and favorites of mine -title track- and the epic \\"Xanadu\\" -transporting me into another world (of paradise) filled with immensely superb prog rock scailing the Mountain Tops of sound to enlighten your pleasure dome. A full 11 minutes of monumental scope and sound quality. Apocalyptic intensity!<br />Next is \\"Closer to the Heart\\" and another RUSH song I remember hearing on the Radio years ago. Alex Lifeson does some really good acoustic work on this one. Simple lyrics, but direct and highly felt.<br />\\"Cinderella Man\\" is a pleasant heart felt song including Top-notch bass playing.<br />\\"Madrigal\\" is the shortest track out of the six on 'A Farewell..' at 2:33. It's a song of love lost, my least favorite on this, but it's still better then anything found on '2112' besides the title track.<br />\\"Cygnus X-1\\" is out of this World at over 10 minutes and truly a spacey prog-rock Masterpiece.<br /><br />~ Glad I finally got into RUSH after all these years after not paying much attention to them. I knew my Music collection was lacking something, so I filled it with two incredible prog-rock bands with YES and now RUSH.<br />- I highly recommend 'A Farewell to Kings' to anyone who likes progressive Rock or is thinking about buying a RUSH record.
B000QFAJ7S|3.0|First of all, I am a Kelly Clarkson fan but I was disappointed with this album.  Every song has the same message: Bad break up, girl gets stronger and finds some strength from the break up.  I could have taken a couple with this theme but every song?  There had to be more going on in her life than this in the past couple of years.  While there are some highlights, most lack strong melodies that KC fans look for.  With that said, if this were a brand new artist it would not have been so disappointing so I am not saying it is horrible, just expected more from her.  This cd is entertaining but will not get the constant rotation on my ipod that the last one got.      While I applaud her desire to be creative there are times in your life when you should respect others feeback. I really hope that her next album is not 13 songs all about this bad experience.
B000B8QF00|5.0|I Love this CD! Most of My favorite songs are on this cd! Alanis has a song for every mood and she is in my opinion one of the best singer and song writers of my generation!
0553278223|5.0|I remember growing up when nuclear war with the Soviet Union was considered inevitable, black citizens were treated like less-than-citizens, life on the other planets of our solar system was considered possible, and the human leap into space was considered just another step in our evolution as a civilization.  Reading these stories reminds me of these days.  Luckily, the end of the book did not happen as Bradbury predicted, but it is a good snapshot of the mental attitude and the social beliefs of this era of time.  It has not aged well, to be truthful, but if you can get behind the veil of time and return to those days, you will enjoy these stories.  My version had the story about all the African-Americans leaving for Mars, so I'm not sure what some of these reviews are grousing about.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|Forget what you've heard about this cd.  Ignore the negative press.  This cd is pure Kelly through and through.  Yes, it has a darker tone, but so what?  The music is still amazing... as is her phenomenal voice.  Whether you're grooving to \\"Never Again\\" or getting all introspective with \\"Sober\\", you will love this cd.
0767802470|5.0|This is the model for films about war at sea.  The direction and photography are expert: there are very few scenes that look like model work, and you have no trouble believing you are on board the U-boat under the most perilous of conditions.  I did think some of the depth charge explosions were too close to be survivable, but I'll accept that as arising from the film's need to get explosions and submarine into the same frame. The crew show a believable and gripping range of characteristics and emotions, including courage, desperation, and ingenuity.  These men believe in their country but have little time for ideology.  They have a bond that holds them together under the worst of circumstances, and the first-rate acting makes that very real.  The ending brings home the cost and futility of war.
B000NA2776|5.0|I'm a little late to the game when it comes to being a Mika fan, but in this case, it is definitely better late than never.  This CD is phenomenal!  His style!  His voice!  The songs!  I could go on and on and on and on.  \\"Grace Kelly\\" starts off the cd, and it grabs you right from the start.  By the time you are grooving to \\"Big Girl\\" near the end of the cd, you'll suddenly realize you haven't had this much fun listening to a cd in a long, long time.  Give it a try.  Trust me, you won't regret it.
B00004XONN|5.0|When handed stardom, most bands will take it and abuse it; some others choose to turn it down flat. Radiohead went with the latter, releasing a moody techno album that put a lot of people off. Yes, the critics loved it, and it won a Grammy. That didn't stop it from being quite controversial, though. Me, I quite like it. I can't see why the shift to lush, deeply textured techno was such a big surprise - songs like \\"Subterranean Homesick Alien\\" certainly predicted the shift. This is, if anything, more bleak and unforgiving than OK Computer, since there's no traditional sarcastic rocker like \\"Electioneering\\" to lighten the mood. Other than the soothing \\"Treefingers\\" and \\"Morning Bell\\", this is not happy stuff - quiet, eerie, minor key, with Tom Yorke doing more weird things with his voice than usual. And the album results in several songs that will probably be fondly remembered ten or fifteen years down the road: the disorienting \\"Everything in its Right Place\\"; the slightly funky title track; \\"The National Anthem\\", with a cool horn part; \\"How to Disappear Completely\\", unnerving and eerie (in a good way, though - it's my favorite song of the batch); the ironically dark \\"Optimistic\\", the multipart \\"Morning Bell\\", with screechy sounds reminiscent of the Pink Floyd classic \\"Echoes\\", and the quiet drama of the closer \\"Motion Picture Soundtrack\\", which houses a hidden track. Hey, that's seven of the ten songs! And it's not like I don't like \\"Treefingers\\" or \\"In Limbo\\"- they're just not as good as the rest. Oh, and the bass playing on this album is stellar - bass wasn't a big part of OK Computer, but it's central to all of these songs. As much as I'd like to call this Radiohead's best album - and it's probably their most creative - I have to give the edge to OK Computer - \\"Idioteque\\" is subpar. Kid A isn't the album for everyone - even OK Computer fans might not like it - but it is one to get if you're in the mood for something quite different. Oh, and if you don't have any Radiohead, do not start here - OK Computer and The Bends are recommended as first albums. Be sure to get this eventually, though.Radiohead, do not start here - OK Computer and The Bends are recommended as first albums. Be sure to get this eventually, though.

If not, run, don't walk, and get yourself a copy today.  \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" is an extraordinary tale of life in the worst conditions, but it also a story of love, hope, and finding a family in a situation where you didn't think it was possible.  Just like \\"The Kite Runner\\", this book will stay with you long after you finish.

0679422714|5.0|Mao was arguably the most repugnant dictator that the world has seen.  Certainly, in the 20th century, it is a race to the bottom between him, Stalin and Hitler.<br /><br />IN the 1980s, when I first read \\"Wild Swans\\" by Jung Chang, I was amazed how strangers would approach me in the street if I was carrying the book.  They all wanted to discuss the book.  It is a truly memorable work that details the lives of Jung Chang, her mother and her grandmother.  Each lived through extraordinary times in Chinese history and each had a different story to tell.<br /><br />With \\"Wild Swans\\" in mind, I looked forward to \\"Mao, the Untold Story\\".  But what a different book this is compared to \\"Wild Swans\\".  This is not to disparage the book.  It is simply different.<br /><br />In essence, \\"Mao\\" is a detailed biography of Mao Tse-tung.  He was an abominable man.  He caused misery and death on a stupendous scale.  And for what?  Little more than for stroking his own ego.  Since his demise, China has prospered.  Jettison the insanity of Maoism and wealth follows.  The people of China and the wider world are better for Mao's passing.<br /><br />Jung Chang and Jon Halliday have compiled an enormous work outlining most that was known and much that was unknown.  They have dented the mystique of Maoism.  Quite correctly, they have documented a litany of horrors that serve to equate Maoism with Nazism.  And this comparison is fair.  It is a great pity that some people still revere Mao.  He was a butcher.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|I am a conservative. If I were famous, Rosie O'Donnell would hate me. But guess what? I still think this is the best animated movie ever created. Don't be afraid that Mr. Miyazaki is trying to insult you in this movie. Miyazaki did not create this film to preach about global warming at all of us un-enlightened fools, he made it because it is a great story. The environmental message is that mindlessly destoying the earth is bad, not that driving a car is going to melt Antarctica.  This film showcases the power of human creativity, not our evil treatment of the earth. Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is set in a world where a horrible war devistated the planet and now it must heal. The environmental problems of Nausicaa's earth are immense, not like the possible issues that some people think might be happening and/or might happen on our earth. Nausicaa is a wise, careful girl that actually understands how to deal with environmental problems and she ended up saving the world because of her patience. She shows how despite our human imperfections, we can still do great things. She is not a flawless, she gets angry in multiple scenes and is certainly not perfect, which shows how human this whole story is. And some other characters demonstrate how human sinfulness can cause abysmal mistakes. This is a classic among classics and whether anime is your thing or not, you will love this movie (I would know, I don't like most anime). Miyazaki never made a bad movie, so anything by him is recomended by me, especially Spirited Away.
1416523359|2.0|I really enjoy the idea of what I think Stephen King is capable of. Every once and a while you will stumble across a King gem, mostly his short stories. However, since he was knocked over by an auto over a decade ago, it seems he has been on a relentless drive to tie every one of his books into the flip world he first touched on with the 'gunslinger'. This wouldn't be bad, except for the fact that King has a real love for this place and when you find him leading up to how his characters relate to this other world, his writing is too tender. Tenderness is not a highpoint of King's writing.<br /><br />This book shifts back and forth over several periods of time over and over again. It takes 200 pages to tell what could have been summed up vividly in two. This is not one of those great King classics like Salem's Lot or the Shining. Nor is it a loving look at a period or situation like Shawshank Redemption or the Green Mile. Instead this is almost a post mortum love letter from himself to perhaps his wife. I think he is trying to build up a series of books as a legacy where he will be seen as some mystic guru who was a lot like the author in this book. However what he is doing is leaving a huge mess of drivel. Seriously, since the mid 80's, this guy has written maybe thirty books and short story collections. Not one of them in my mind lives up to what he produced before that, and Lisey's Story is one of his weaker efforts.
B000QFAJ7S|2.0|I absolutely love Kelly Clarkson.  She is the sole reason I watched American Idol.  I love her voice, her charm, her wit, everything.  I loved her first two albums.  I loved the song \\"Never Again\\".  All of this love is great, isn't it?!?  Well, I don't love her new album \\"My December\\".  In fact, I don't like it at all.<br /><br />I have to give Kelly A LOT of credit for having the 'gall' to release this album.  It's clearly not too good, and it can't even begin to hold a candle to her work on Breakaway.  However, Kelly did not want to be a puppet anymore, and I commend her for that.  I really, truly respect her decision to try to stand on her own two feet.  But this album is really pretty awful.  She has a lot of work to do, if she wants to become a singer/songwriter.<br /><br />Like I said, \\"Never Again\\", great single, great song.  There are a couple of others that are 'ok', and the rest are repetative, mundane, and lack the polish that the rest of her work has done, thanks to all of the terrific songwriters and producers she has worked with.  Clive Davis was no idiot for saying this album shouldn't have been released in its current state.  I agree.  It's just simply not a good CD.

0618680004|1.0|British ethologist, Richard Dawkins, professor for the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford University, is a long-time popularizer of Darwinian evolution, ardent proponent of atheism, and prominent debunker of religion. In his latest book, The God Delusion (Houghton Mifflin, 2006), Dawkins' thesis is that belief in a supernatural creator qualifies as a delusion, which he defines as a persistent false belief held in the face of strong contradictory evidence.     Dawkins claims his purpose in writing is to convert religious believers to his brand of atheism. \\"If this book works as I intend,\\" says Dawkins, \\"religious readers who open it will be atheists when they put it down.\\"  Are Dawkins' arguments persuasive? Does he accomplish his goal? These questions deserve closer scrutiny. For the sake of space, I'll restrict my comments to reviewing only one chapter of his book.    Dismissing Proofs for God's Existence    In Chapter 3, Dawkins mentions the classic proofs for the existence of God developed by the medieval Christian philosophers Anselm (late 11th century) and Thomas Aquinas (13th century). For example, the cosmological argument uses the principle of cause and effect to establish the existence of a necessary Being (God) who causes the existence of the cosmos. But Dawkins dismisses this by claiming it makes an \\"entirely unwarranted assumption that God himself is immune to the regress.\\"  In other words, if we assume that everything has a cause, then what caused God?    What Dawkins doesn't mention is that there are actually three different forms of the cosmological argument. Aquinas offered one form, but Gottfried Leibniz (d. 1716) proposed another, and a third was further developed by Arabic philosophers during the Middle Ages. This last form, known as the kalam cosmological argument, is considered by many current Christian theologians to be the strongest of the three. It has been defended by Christian philosophers over the years, most recently by William Lane Craig.     In his books, Craig offers an overview of this argument, objections against it, and rebuttals defending the soundness of its premises and conclusion. Simply put, the kalam cosmological argument proposes:    1) Whatever begins to exist has a cause.  2) The universe began to exist.  3) Therefore, the universe has a cause.    Craig offers two philosophical reasons for the soundness of the first premise and two scientific reasons for why the second premise is true. Therefore, the concluding third statement is true. Regarding the conclusion, Craig states that \\"philosophical analysis reveals that such a cause [of the universe] must have several of the principal theistic attributes.\\"  Therefore, not only must God exist, but He would have the qualities generally ascribed to Him in the Bible, i.e., omniscience, omnipotence, rationality, etc.    Sophomoric Smugness    What is so breath-taking about Dawkins' smug dismissal of the cosmological argument is that he does not attempt to respond to any of the specific points that Craig brings addresses in the kalam cosmological argument. It's not as if Craig is an obscure author whom Dawkins would not be familiar. Craig has defended this argument in three books dating back to 1979, written numerous articles over the years, and he has publically debated the issue with many skeptics, including the well-known atheist philosopher Quentin Smith.     But instead of dealing with any of the serious points that Craig brings out, Dawkins simply asks, \\"Where did God come from?\\" With this, Dawkins shows that he is totally unfamiliar with the wealth of literature on the subject and the strongest arguments currently employed. If he had done his homework, he would have realized that his question misses the point entirely. The first point of the kalam cosmological argument is that whatever begins to exist must have a cause. God, by definition, never began to exist. God is the \\"Uncaused Cause.\\" So the question \\"Who made God?\\" is irrelevant! This is the kind of reckless handling one might expect from first year philosophy students, but not from a seasoned, distinguished university professor.     But one might counter, then why postulate God as having always existed, isn't it simpler to just assume that the universe has always existed? Craig notes two reasons why this is not feasible. Scientifically, we know that the universe is not eternal because of the evidence for the \\"Big Bang,\\" and second, the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics.  Based on these scientifically well-established principles, the most rational assumption is that the universe has not always existed; it had a beginning. And since it began to exist, it must have a cause other than itself. This cause must be of another kind, namely, a supernatural cause. Therefore, a supernatural Creator must exist.    Dawkins mentions several other arguments used to prove God's existence, and in each case dismisses them by arguing from a weak form of the proof. Over and over again, he builds straw men to knock down. So much for Dawkins' \\"incisive logic.\\"    It seems that the only person deluded is Dawkins who thinks he has adequately explained away God.

B000QFAJ7S|5.0|This is one of the best CD's I've heard in a very long time.  Clarkson is an incredibly gifted songwriter who knows exactly how to reach her target audience (aka anyone who has ever had a broken heart).  Her vocals range from breathy and sensual, to jazz infused and playful.  The disc is eclectic and smart, and most certainly worth having in your collection.  Look for \\"My December\\" to be recognized at the Grammys in 2008.  My only question is... What was Clive Davis thinking?!  There are at least 6 Top 10 hits on the album, while the rest of the tracks are more apt to please the music snobs who value artistry over the quick fix of pop radio hits.  Stellar tracks include the future #1 (and possible song of the year), \\"Sober\\", the ska/pop pleaser, \\"How I Feel\\"(this album's \\"Since U Been gone\\", in terms of its killer hook), and \\"Chivas\\", the jazzy/blues filled hidden track that is already a fan favorite.

B000002MG1|5.0|It was the summer of my lost youth, and my cousin and friends were diving on the cliffs in Newport, Rhode Island, and we knew we shouldn't have been there, and I was bringing a boom box with us everywhere. They  wanted LL Cool J and the like, and I pumped out \\"Out of Time\\" and they all gave me dirty looks, but moved their heads and got into it just the same.<br /><br />When 'Automatic for the People' came out, it was if I had found my place in the world. I was an older, (much older) teenager, but I seemed to find my niche in this busy sector of life, and Michael Stipe seemed to portray in no uncertain terms, what it was like to be alive.<br /><br />I was alive. 'Everybody Hurts' is an anthem for a lost culture, not just a generation. How splendid the video was, how utterly bewildering the song was, still echoing somewhere in my minds eye today, stood sinister and barren on the wooded knoll of my future; and I thought, with so much energy, that things couldn't be that bad. That with some thought and drive, anyone could really get through anything that this cruel world throws at them. That is what this album meant to me friends.<br /><br />'Automatic for the People' is pure, refined Stipe at his finest. Those days where REM was splitting ears all over the globe, and the baby boomer generation asking 'wow, who is this.'<br /><br />I miss those days of wonderment and fine music. I miss those days of knowing and anticipating your favorite bands next album, and not wondering, not hoping, but KNOWING, that it would be magical, tangible, and that it would speak to you. That every song would be your favorite and you would know each one word for word, just like 'Green'.<br /><br />Songs like, 'Find the River' and 'Try not To Breath' told me that things are what they are, and REM proved beyond all recognition and understanding, that they, all four of them at that time??? were the band to be reckoned with......<br /><br />.....Michael Stipe has given us poetry in motion and I thank him for his prose and talent, and for that, for that small, simple part of this gigantic metaphor we find ourselves in, is worth living...just to hear this poetic album of solitude and understanding....<br /><br />As others have stated before me, \\"Automatic for the<br />People\\" is one of the most enduring musical achievements of the 1990's.<br /><br />In fact, I would put it in the leagues of the finest albums of all time, on the run with RadioHead's 'Ok Computer'.<br /><br />Thank you., for that small, simple part of this gigantic metaphor we find ourselves in, is worth living...just to hear this poetic album of solitude and understanding....

B000QFAJ7S|5.0|I have resisted Kelly Clarkson to some degree over the past couple of years, and I think I am realizing that my feelings were incorrect and unfounded.  I was pretty convinced that she was yet another Idol winner turned pop star, and was putting out catchy, but overtly pop'py sounding bubblegum.  At least this particular album (I now want to investigate her others) is simply incredible.  It is deep, layered, thoughtful, edgy, gritty, rock and roll.  I mean this disc is not even remotely bubblegum.  I am thrilled I took a chance on this, and now will re-evaluate her past works.
B000002UA2|4.0|I chose to review Obscured By Clouds since a plethora of reviewers chose to review the more popular albums like Meddle, Dark Side Of The Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals and The Wall. thus ignoring this album.<br /><br />It is a fact that soundtrack albums by pop artists aren't usually of the high caliber as their regular, studio album counterparts.  This album is no exception.  This album isn't as individualistic as other Pink Floyd albums.  However, i still rate this album with 4 stars because it is a pivotal, musical and lyrical nexus between the spacey, haunting Meddle and the more urgent, contemporary electronic Dark Side Of The Moon.  Obscure By Clouds definitely paved the way, musically and lyrically, for things to come!<br /><br />Obscured By Clouds was actually the soundtrack to the film, La Vallee, by Barbet Schroeder.  This was the second film by Schroeder to incorporate Pink Floyd's music (the first being the soundtrack to More).  The film takes place in the primitive (but many times beautiful) regions of New Guinea.  Pink Floyd's music lends itself well to this film.<br /><br />Musically, the album starts out with the title track.  It is an instrumental which incorporates many of the synthesizers and electronics as their next album, Dark Side Of The Moon.  In fact, this instrumental could have easily fit, stylewise, on the Dark Side album.  Some of the other important tracks are as follows:  Burning Bridges- a slow, bluesy ballad with the trademark \\"bending of the notes\\" by David Gilmour on his guitar.  There is also a beautiful interplay between Gilmour's and Wright's vocals, similar to Time from Dark Side... and Echoes from Meddle.  Especially nice is the harmonization between the two of them.  The Gold It's In The... is a power rocker sung by Gilmour.  Wots... Uh The Deal is a beautiful, introspective ballad incorporating descending chord progressions.  It is my favorite track from the album.  Childhood\\"s End is still another rocker sung by Gilmour.This particular track is somwhat reminiscent of Money from Dark Side....  Free Four is Roger Water's only lead vocal contribution to this album. This song contains lyrical references to dying.  Finally, Stay is a seductive, slow ballad sung by Rick Wright (with a nice wah-wah pedal guitar by Gilmour.<br /><br />The most crucial aspects of this album are the lyrics provided by Roger Waters (with the exception of Childhood's End).  This is the first time where where cynicism plays prominently into the lyrical content of a Pink Floyd album.  This cynical trend was to increase on each successive album from here on out.<br /><br />Even though this album isn't quite as innovative or progressive as other Pink Floyd albums, I would still recommend it, \\"Cos there's a chill wind blowing in my soul and I think I'm growing old.\\"
B00004Y6O7|5.0|Van Halen is the type of band that can satisfy somebody with high expectations. The interesting thing about them is that while they certainly have a sound of their own, it seems like experimenting is a high priority for them. Between the hair-metal of \\"1984\\", the half-moody, half-good time \\"Van Halen 2\\" and the unstoppable monster of their debut album, \\"Van Halen\\", (all of which had their share of popular tunes), it's easy to see how something less commercial or experimental would tend to go unnoticed.   Unfortunately, that's the case with \\"Fair Warning\\". A brilliant album, yes, but the truth of thematter is that it wasn't remembered for high-on-the-chart singles such as \\"Jump\\" or \\"Panama\\". However, what it lacks for in commercial success it more than makes up for in clever songwriting and an overall dark tone. On a positive note, it's probably one of their overall greatest albums.   \\"Fair Warning\\" is the type of album where each song can flow pretty well into the following, even if the styles are a bit different. In addition, \\"Fair Warning\\" overall paints an easy-to-see picture. You can almost imagine a movie being made in the scenery that's painted by the rebelliousness of \\"Unchained\\" or the third-world neighborhood of \\"Mean Street\\". It's a land of murky tales and strange situations that's just so interesting and quite dark that you are brought in without hardly knowing. The imagery on the album covers, front and back, hint at what such a place might be like; twisted days where people go wild, uncertain events pop up out of nowhere, and all is portrayed by the soundtrack, a hard-rocking, moody masterpiece that is \\"Fair Warning\\".   All right, so more to the point, the music on this album is quite unique and interesting. Even in all the murky emotions, the sing-a-long choruses and anthemic displays of power show you that while this album may prove to be a change of pace, Van Halen is basically the same. Eddie Van Halen displays more exciting stunts on his guitar, while David Lee Roth erupts like a volcano with his comments and amusingly entertaining performances. Michael Anthony's basswork is quite present on this album, too, and Alex Van Halen's \\"what kind of drums is that man playing on?\\" drumming is top-notch, too. Overall, this album is yet another display of Van Halen's both incredible talent and catchy songwriting.    \\"Mean Street\\": The first, thirty seconds are Eddie Van Halen's progressive dual-handed tapping, a technique so unusual that when my guitar teacher showed me a long, long time ago, I was drawn in and bought this album. The main riff is so awesome it makes you wanna turn the power all the way up. The closing solo is very impressive as well, and basically, everybody is at the top of their game here. An instant classic.  \\" 'Dirty Movies' \\": Wow, in just four minutes, Van Halen plays one of the most unpredictable songs I've ever heard, in a GOOD way. There are a lot of changes in this song, and random things occuring, such as David Lee Roth's spoken word, \\"Hey, you remember when that girl was prooom queen? Oh, wow.\\", and \\"Take it off! Take it all off!!!\\", and the cheering, this is a great song full of surprises.  \\"Sinner's Swing!\\": A fast-paced rocker that contains a very explicit lyric, especially for a VH song, but this is an awesome three-minute hard-rock blast.  \\"Hear About It Later\\": OK, a little time-travel here. Remember VH's debut? A song on there, \\"Feel Your Love Tonight\\"? I CANNOT TELL YOU how much this track sounds like a murky, love-gone-bad version of that song. Even so, it's still original with an anthemic sing-a-long chorus and some interesting, opening guitar work.  \\"Unchained\\": Alongside \\"Mean Street\\", this is probably my favorite song on the album. It opens with a huge, loud, crunchy guitar riff, the fast, fade-in drums, and DLR's, \\"ALL RIGHT!\\", shout. Great soloing and another funny DLR performance inside.(\\"One break, commmming uppp!\\".)  \\"Push Comes To Shove\\": A very unusual VH song focused around a funky bassline and more basic drumwork. This song makes me thing about walking along the suburban streets of New York City, bundled up in the autumn, thinking about everything that's going on in your life. With such lyrics as, \\"Seems like forty days and forty nights since somebody's called me by my first name/ Including you\\", this is an introspective song that's an absolute delight, served up Van Halen style.  \\"So This Is Love?\\": The complete opposite of \\"Push Comes To Shove\\", this song has the swing and groove of an early Black Sabbath tune (one of Tony Iommi's guitar heroes was jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt). Along with an original VH sound and for some reason, a Red Hot Chili Peppers vibe, this is yet another great rocker.  \\"Sunday Afternoon In The Park\\": A slow, sludgy, two-minute instrumental with some of the wildest guitar playing I can recall hearing from Eddie. The riff starts and stops with some slow but cool drum fills of his brother Alex, and then, fading in is a hot, nasty guitar riff that leads into the closer...  \\"One Foot Out The Door\\": The killer riff continues here with Alex Van Halen's trademark, fade-in drumming, and DLR and Michael Anthony both kick in. The song and album close with yet another blazing guitar solo, and thus ends it all.    There you go, the dark, underrated masterpiece that is \\"Fair Warning\\". Although not the most commercially successful release, it's among Van Halen's very best. So if you want an album with massive talent but still packs the anthemic immortality that Van Halen displays so well, \\"Fair Warning\\" can almost undoubtedly get that taken care of. If you like this and want to explore more VH, I'd strongly recommend checking out, at least, \\"Van Halen (1)\\" and \\"1984\\", which both show these guys at the top of their game. Have a good time with this one, and until next time, peace!

B000002UAR|5.0|Being born after the Beatles broke up, I can't really comprehend the world before them.  From my childhood, I remember my older siblings wearing out what was left of their Beatles singles all through the 70s.  It wasn't until much later that I separated the songs that were part of my childhood from songs that are part of my adulthood.  I firmly believe that everyone will discover the Beatles at some point in their life.  It wasn't until I heard Revolver that I had my revelation.  Popular music that is timeless until time's end.  If you could somehow erase everyone's memory of the Beatles without removing their impact on music, I believe that you could release Revolver today and it would dominate the charts.  Neither imitators, admirers, nor detractors have been able to pull off the magic that is Revolver.  The music on this album defys description - everyone who has discovered it knows that.  Everyone who hasn't - will.
B000Q6GUT8|4.0|SHOOTER is a fast paced, well-photographed, imaginative thriller - the kind of movie that does not allow the attention span to wander for a second if the full impact of the drama is to be appreciated.  Based on the popular novel 'Point of Impact' by Stephen Hunter and adapted for the screen by Jonathan Lemkin, this is a story we don't want to know: the Intelligence and Security of the US are shown to influenced by financial gains, greed, and lawlessness - all undercover in the most frightening ways. Director Antoine Fuqua ('Training Day', 'Tears of the Sun', 'King Arthur') knows his way around this kind of material and it is to his credit that he keeps the tension almost unbearably high for nearly two hours.<br /><br />Retired military sniper Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg) is living a lonely but secure life in the mountains until he is approached by Colonel Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover) to return to the art of killing: the President is threatened by an assassin and only Bob will be able to trace the paces that will prevent the event from happening.  Bob returns to Washington, DC, Baltimore, and Philadelphia (the three places where the possible assassination could take place) and leads the FBI and CIA to the point of discovery, and at that time everything changes: to share the facts and events would be to spoil the innumerable surprises that alter the events of the story.  Bob discovers who his real friends are (Kate Mara and Michael Pe&ntilde;a) and the rest of the film is a chase and destroy mission that has the viewer gripping the chair.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg continues to prove that he is more than a hunky underwear model (though he is keeping his physique in perfect form!) and delivers one of his most completely realized characterizations of his career.  The supporting cast includes such stalwarts as Ned Beatty, Elias Koteas, Rade Serbedzija as well as Glover, Mara and Pe&ntilde;a, and each manages to make some fairly unbelievable roles credible.

I've never heard another band do anything similar to these recordings live, and if someone has, I doubt it could be as good as this.     The Studio disc: This will probably be the least favorite part of the album for most people. I will admit, some of the songs can get boring, unless you look at it in the right way. It is simply an extreme form of artistic expression through sound, and while it may not pass of as good \\"music\\" to some, perhaps a different outlook on it will change the way you think of it.     There are some songs on the studio album that are brilliant, and are definitely worth the listen. \\"Grantchester Meadows\\" definitely is the finest song on this album. It's so delicate and refreshing, if your an appreciator of the outdoors.     This album may be of interest to you, or it may not, it simply depends deeply on your opinions in music. I know that seems sort of obvious, but you'll know what I mean once you listen to it.     Definitely listen to the preview tracks before you think of buying.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|This very impressive Complete Collection has given me the chance to revisit a show I love and adore. I think this series is a television classic that ranks alongside Hill Street Blues. This series has one of America's finest writers - Aaron Sorkin. It also has one of the finest ensemble casts that I have ever seen in any broadcast medium. And a sense of humor, optimism, hope and whimsy that I find deeply moving.     One of the morals is that doing the right thing and having the courage of your convictions is far harder than taking the easier politically convenient route. A lesson that we should all learn. What's also amazing is how the show preempts so many of the issues we're grappling now - Privacy and Terrorism being two examples.    Seasons 1-4 are absolutely fantastic. Seasons 5-7 is a definite drop-in quality, mostly due to Aaron Sorkin's absence. Many characters actions aren't consistent with how they'd been previously established. Will Bailey was a great speechwriter, not a political operative. Toby betraying the President? CJ as Chief of Staff? And why wasn't Leo promoted to VP? Nevertheless these seasons are still watchable - providing you accept it's John Wells \\"ER-in-the-West-Wing\\".    Seasons 1-4 at least, are classic television. and if you love intelligent, literate television which respects the intelligence of the viewer - then please buy this Collection. You won't regret it.
B00006JKOL|4.0|I hate to give a tull album 4 out of 5 stars, but I did that in the consideration for those that may not be huge Tull fans, or may be very new to Tull.     This album displays wonderful work from every member of the band. Barre's guitar solo on the title track is wonderful, but I cannot help but notice the killer bass and drums that are backing it. Anderson's voice is better than ever, and his songwriting is right on the spot.     Songs such as \\"Cold Wind to Valhalla\\" really hits the right place. The forest-like jams that are contained on this album never get old to me. One of my favorite Tull albums, and I hope I will always have it in my collection.     The album is full of heart, and it's just fantastic.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Great series showing the natural world, full of wonder and beauty.  Attenborough's excellent<br />commentary was not used for the American showing, alas.  Show this to your kids, so they can<br />see what might still be saved...
B000MRAAJW|5.0|My 26 yr. old son asked for this for his b'day. His friends highly recommended it. He received the High Definition version for his HD Television. He put the first of three DVD's on for me and his grandparents. Beautiful and eternal in presentation.   I recommend this only if you believe in a creator. If you are an evolution minded person you won't appreciate it.     Thank you to the makers of this film.
0743496728|5.0|This is the second book that I have read by Jodi Picoult (the first one was \\"My sister's keeper\\").  She is one of the writers taking on a real life troubles onto the paper.  She brings out the \\"taboo\\" subjects into the readers view.  She leads us behind the scenes of the dramatic character's mind.  This one is so close to all of us in US, with recent shootings in public places, \\"the safer harbors\\" for children - schools.  \\"Nineteen minutes\\" is a story about two teenagers who used to be friends....but somewhere along their short lives they departed, yet connected in the most catastrophic situation.  She tries to bring the reality of a troubled life that has lead to the overwhelming disaster.  She let me be unbiased and more understanding of the situation.....no excuses but perhaps a broader perspective on \\"murderer's\\" mind.  The question arises....\\"Can we prevent those situations?\\", if we know what they can be caused by.....
B0007CNXUK|5.0|This movie really touched my heart. It's based on the man who wrote Peter Pan, and in my opinion his story is more remarkable than the play he wrote. A man who struggled to write a hit play, struggled to find happiness within his marriage, and struggled to find himself. He finds a young boy named Peter who's mom is played be Kate Winslett. He becomes involved with this young boys family and his whole life changes. This is a touching story, and dare I say will bring a tear to your eye. My wife and I thouroughly enjoyed this movie. I hope you do as well.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Everyone should see this movie.The things shown in this movie are happening every second as we live on this earth.We all should do what we can to save the future of our planet.After all it is where we all live.This is a must see movie whether you agree or disagree with the facts and details contained in the movie.
B0000AKCLS|5.0|This album is full of dynamic sounds and with every play you discover some new twist or turn that Joe performs. All tracks are rich and entertaining with soul ousing from every single note. This album illustrates the skill of a real blues man who can bring out the history and the feelings of the genre and make it sound brand new.
B00009MGGI|5.0|The late Ian Richardson plays a charming,suave,gentlemanly snake-in-the-grass....in fact he elevates it to high art.<br />It is like a modern \\"Richard III\\" with all the murder and intrigue that goes with it.Nice to know the USofA hasn't cornered the market on scoundrels in politics.
B00005JPQT|5.0|The Die Hard series has been a roller coaster for the movie going public. The first movie is considered by most one of the best action movies ever made. However like any success there are always downfalls and by the end of Die Hard 3: Die Hard With a Vengeance the series seemed to Die...Hard. Surprisingly \\"Live Free Die Hard\\" finally brings the Die Hard series back to where it belongs. A successful action film that delivers!<br /><br />Live Free Die Hard (aka Die Hard 4) takes place 12 years after Officer John McClane's Die Hard with a Vengeance. Life has not gotten much better for John. He is still divorced; his daughter lives close, but wants nothing to do with him, and for the most part Office McClane is just driving an unmarked car waiting for retirement.<br /><br />That was until today. All of this changes when John asked to bring in hacker Matt Farrell (played by Justin Long) to the FBI for questioning. However, it seems that others have different plans for Mr Farrell, and the rollercoaster ride begins. It appears that Thomas Gabriel (played Timothy Olyphant) is not happy with the way our society has become and has decided to have a fire sale (a hacker term for basically destroying all the technology in the United States and bringing us back to the stone). There is only one problem with his plan, Office John McClane is now involved and as you can guess the body count gets extremely high and the typical McClane banter between the terrorist hits new levels.<br /><br />All of the Die Hard films have not only been known for their action, acting, and script, but also for their direction. This time around is no different as Len Wiseman (Underworld) takes the helm and the movie looks amazing as ever. No shot disappoints and the story definitely benefits from having him behind the lens.<br /><br />The one predominant fear many movie goers have had for the past few months is how would a PG-13 Die Hard film work? Would it stay true to the franchise? The answer is 99%....yes! This film is definitely a hard PG-13 (in fact it's unclear how it was not rated R) The violence is right up there with every other Die Hard film (more violent than Die Hard with A Vengeance) The only time the audience was groaning instead of cheering was the PG-13 version of Office McClane's signature phrase.<br /><br />Live Free Die Hard is THE action movie for the summer of 2007.

0684857219|5.0|This is the absolute best book on bodybuilding I have ever found.  I can always go back to it and learn more.  If I learn something about bodybuilding elsewhere, I can come back to this book and discover that that thing I learned was right there in Arnold's book.  This book changed my life and I have transformed my body and continue to do so.  As for the training programs, I see so many people complain about them.  Arnold makes it very clear that these programs are a template and do not have to be followed to the letter.  The idea is to give you a start, and idea, and then you should take what you have learned and apply it and create your own program.    For all the people who say that his programs are overtraining, I say you are not paying attention.  Anyone should be able to perform the basic program.  It is not difficult or impossible.  It's people who try to go straight to the more advanced programs who suffer.  Arnold is trying to teach you to think for yourself.  Too many people want to be told how to train, instead of learning how to train.  This book teaches you to learn how to train.  If you see it as a training manual, then you totally missed the point, and Arnold makes that clear throughout the book.    As for the idea that expanding your ribcage or training your inner chest is impossible, I counter that I have done exactly that.  My ribcage has noticibly expanded and my inner chest development is much better than it was a few years ago.  The word impossible is for fools.  I dont' listen to anyone who uses the word CAN'T.

0765316978|5.0|Unusually for a newer author, Scalzi has written an unbroken line of winners.    I've read almost everything he's written, and every one was a winner.  \\"The Last Colony\\" is a fitting and quite good end to the trilogy he started with \\"Old Man's War\\".  Unlike too many authors, Scalzi ends this trilogy properly, with a bang-up finish, and none of the usual drifting way out into left field as so many others do.    \\"The Old Man\\" of the trilogy is an entirely believable and likable protagonist, and the story finishes up with a most satisfying conclusion.  There are few loose ends left unaddressed, and you can say goodbye to some interesting people with no regrets.    I look forward to more from Scalzi.  He's on a run of writing stories that are full of fresh ideas, interesting people, and interesting situations.
1596912855|2.0|I just finished reading Shannon Hale's latest release called Austenland. It's about a Jane Austen obsessed woman who is gifted a stay at a place in England where most modern comforts are foregone and everyone involved wears regency attire. Jane, the protagonist, has had a hard time with relationships because she's so caught up in finding her own Mr. Darcy. The set up for the story was pretty unbelievable so I had a hard time getting into it at the beginning because I wasn't bought into the storyline. I know there are Austen lovers, me being one of them, but to the degree described in this book??? There was a lot redeeming laugh-out-loud humor that helped the book. I also enjoyed the clever string of chapter introductions that were included. It was a quick read, so if you're bored... invest time in it. If not, I wouldn't tell you to go out of your way to read it.
B000OVLBEO|3.0|The special effects are wonderful. The main character, the biker rider with the on-fire skull is original. There's not much character development as in Spider man 2. The fighting scenes are not as fantastic either.     Overall it's worth watching twice.
B000OVLBEO|5.0|Ghost Rider is an excellent series - what fun I imagine it must be to go around New York City solving crimes with an invisible ghost helping you along the way.  Ghost Rider helps his teenage friends by rearranging whatever words & letters he can find around him to communicate...he has to spell things because he cannot speak or even draw pictures.  For this reason, Ghost Rider is educational as well as entertaining - you have to follow along with the written clues to see if you can solve the mystery before the rest of the team does!  I felt really smart when I figured out that the maid was actually carrying Mr. Hooper's baby and not her husband's.  Paternity tests are incredible!  I don't want to ruin anymore plot lines so you will just have to buy the DVD yourself to see what happens!
B000002KIK|4.0|I guess that was a tongue-in-cheek album title considering the word \\"die\\" is sung in one form or another in a few songs on the album.  Anyway...Old Geezer's 5-star review nailed my sentiments for this album perfectly, though I'll give a more restrained 4 stars.  I am not particularly a Black Sabbath fan.  I used to own Master of Reality a while back and I did enjoy it, but I found this album only by accident in my older brother's library one day many moons ago.  It immediately grabbed me back then with all it's fantastic hooks, and it has remained a deeply satisfying album to listen to over the years as my musical tases have greatly expanded.  I love the varied textures and the copius good guitar licks.  Best of all, the vocals are very powerful both melodically and harmonically.  I will only give 4 stars to an album that is consistently decent for the full duration.  There are a couple of less interesting tracks here, but overall the album is a blast from start to finish.  Great listening!    PS - Fer cryin out loud, Air Dance is a dang good song...there's nothing wrong with Black Sabbath throwing in some softer music lines for a little relief!
B000FKO5WO|5.0|Hey All,  If you need to review Mark Knopfler's musuc - Please don't.  Either you like it or not.  Seen any lefty playing right handed - yes - good. Just listen to Sultans of Swing.

014144116X|4.0|Forster's novel is a classic. it appears on all \\"Top 100\\" lists, for list maniacs, but it is not really all that great. I can certainly think of a good many novels I'd rather read or reread. In the film version, the novel's exotic setting springs to life, of course, and that is 99% of the novel's appeal. Otherwise it is a rather dull social drama, which bears remarkable resemblance to the inter-sex squabbles D.H.Lawrence was so good at. Americans have a need to be liked that prevents them from going for the jugular in quite the same lacerating way the English can, unless, of course, it is with a knife. This novel is really about the disappointment women feel for their hypocritical men: husbands, brothers, and fathers. The ladies saw through the facade of English decency and authors like Lawrence (a woman-hater) and Forster (a man-lover) were on to it. Their men promised to treat Indians as though they were Englishmen but, of course, never did. Nor did they treat their women as ladies. Everybody except white Englishmen got ordered about senselessly and the women recognized the stupidity of it all and the mindless inhumanity of it. This is Forster's subject really, and when they go at it, his men and women sound astonishingly like the characters in \\"Women in Love.\\" They could be anywhere, no where.  By putting them in India, Forster created a classic.
B000KIBOUC|2.0|I bought this with the idea I could turn my Mag Lite into an LED Mag Lite. You are better off going to Home Depot and buying the Xenon replacement bulbs for your C/D cell Mag Lite. This LED bulb is very dim compared to the standard OEM bulb. It has a blue tint to it also. I tried the new LED when I bought it with new batteries also. The bulb does work and would be a good long lasting back up if you have already went through both bulbs that came with your C/D cell Mag Lite, but really, who has? Buy the Xenon replacement bulbs or if you really want a good LED flashlight get the Stanley tripod light.
0307341542|5.0|I loved this book.  The author's over attention (sometimes) to details added to the book, because it was coming from Camille's point of view and helped to characterize her obsessiveness.  Once I got started, I didn't want to set this book down.

B000J103WK|5.0|The Eagles are one of my favorite rock bands. I was never fortunate enough to enjoy their music in person but this HD DVD brings me pretty close to that experience. I was tempted to get the DVD version some months ago but glad I held out. The classics are all here - Tequila Sunrise, Love Will Keep Us Alive, You Belong To The City, Dirty Laundry, Hotel California, Desperado, etc. The Audio/Video recording is superb and the Menu organizes the songs/chapters very well. This has got to be one of the best concert HD DVDs out there. A perfect way to show off your home theater.
159562015X|5.0|I have used this with clients and have been impressed with how consistently on-target the assessment is. Rather than focusing on weaknesses to improve, the premise of the assessment is that one can be far more effective by recognizing their strengths and building on them.  Most recently, I purchased a bulk amount of the books to issue to a client group of 12 people.  (You have to purchase the book to get the \\"secret online code.\\")  The group learned not only what their own strengths were (some initial surprises as the respondents had never considered some of the strengths before) but how the traits of other team members complemented the team.  The individual reports generated include an action plan to build on your strengths.  All in all, a good and deservedly popular tool.
B000AP2ZDK|5.0|I have been a fan of Jay Dee for a while and I own most of the albums he has ever worked on.  This is the only instrumental album I own of his and I love it.  I recommend this album to anyone who likes Metal Fingerz, Madlib, Slum Village or anyone on Stones Throw.  I almost never bought this CD but I'm glad I finally did.  It will go good for anyone's collection.  The beats are very unusual and thats what I love about J Dilla.  I think the best tracks are track 10 called Time:The Donut of the Heart and track 25 called Walkinonit.  If you do not own this album please download these tracks somehow.  Ridiculous Beats!  On another note I was sad to hear that such a great producer passed away. I believe Jay Dee would have been in his GOLDEN AGE if he were still alive.    R.I.P. J Dilla
B000QFAJ7S|2.0|HERE IS THE REAL DEAL. MOST OF THE REVIEWS ARE FROM DIE HARD KELLY CLARKSON FANS. I ENJOY HER MUSIC. I THOUGHT HER LAST ALBUM WAS FINE TUNED, CRAFTED BY EXPERTS, AND SIMPLY A HIT ALBUM. THERE WERE HOOKS, STRONG VOCALS, AND SOLID MELODIES. YOU LISTEN TO THIS AND IT'S THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER. SAME GUITAR RIFFS, SAME CALM VERSES AND HER SCREAMING DURING THE CHORUSES.    I THINK SOBER IS THE ONE SOLID TRACK ON THE ALBUM BESIDES THE SECOND SONG, WHICH HAS POSSIBILITIES. I HEARD HER SAY THAT SHE HAS SOLD 15 MILLION ALBUMS AND SHE SHOULD KNOW WHAT SHE IS DOING WHEN THE EXECS TOLD HER TO REDO IT. ACTUALLY, HER PRODUCERS AND CLIVE CREATED AN ALBUM THAT SOLD 15 MILLION ALBUMS SO THEY KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING. SHE DECIDED TO TAKE FULL CONTROL OF THIS ALBUM AND IT SHOWS. IT SOUNDS VERY AMATEUR AND REPETITIVE. I'M NOT TRYING TO BE HARSH OR CRUEL...JUST HONEST. THERE ARE NO HITS JUST AS THE FIRST ONE PROVED. SHE NEEDS MORE EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH THE BIG SH OTS BEFORE SHE STARTS CALLING ALL THE SHOTS AND THINKING SHE CAN PRODUCE A HIT ALBUM. THE SCREAMING GETS ON YOUR NERVES AND YOU JUST DON'T WALK AWAY SINGING. THIS WAS HARD TO LISTEN TO FROM SUCH A TALENT!
1932100660|5.0|The China Study gave me answers to many health and diet mysteries.  Especially illuminating was the \\"three stages of cancer\\" section.  Here I found the tremendous impact my choice of diet can have on the second stage of cancer, the promotion stage.  Breast, prostate and colo-rectal cancers are discussed at a level that maintains the standard of professional research done while communicating it in a way that I, a non-medical layman can understand.  That combination of educating the reader and giving the highest degree of research information is a thread that runs through the entire book.  The foundation for a primarily plant-based diet, even a vegan diet, is laid out brick of understanding by brick of understanding.  Heart disease, diabetes, osteoporosis and diseases of the immune system are presented adequately with primary source references throughout.
B00005JNS0|2.0|Pixar usually makes children's films that also appeal to adults on many levels, including jokes that fly well above the heads of youngsters. My son, who is three, loves to watch the first ten minutes of \\"Cars.\\" Then he gets extremely bored and stops watching. Good films, such as \\"Finding Nemo,\\" \\"The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh\\" and \\"Toy Story,\\" will hold his attention for the duration. (He knows \\"Finding Nemo\\" from start to finish and has watched it, at minimum, fifty times.)  I also enjoy good children's movies (I know most of the lines from \\"Finding Nemo\\"), yet I find this film tedious. At a runtime of nearly two hours, I cannot sit through the entire movie in one sitting and even then have a difficult time watching all of it. It starts out well enough and the ending, with its positive messages of friendship, loyalty and good sportsmanship, is quite good. Much of the material in between, however, is fairly weak. Scenes drag on far too long and are just plain dull. The messages could have been conveyed in fewer and more truncated scenes and still have been as effective. The basis for a very good film here is certainly evident. As usual, Pixar's animation is excellent and the tone is just right for kids: simple without being condescending and with very sparse scatological humor (which is an astonishing feat, given Larry the Cable Guy's involvement). The voice acting is well cast and features uniformly fine performances. With more judicious writing and editing, \\"Cars\\" could have been another Pixar classic. (2.5/5 stars)

0340752122|5.0|Kate Fox, a social anthropologist and Co-Director of the Social Issues Research Centre in Oxford, who has lived in England, America, Ireland and France, takes a revealing look at the quirks and habits of the English people. Being very English herself, she holds a mirror up to the English national character and reveals the most famous traits as well as the most bizarre reflex reactions. She attempts to discover the curious, hidden rules of behaviour that all English people seem to follow, but few are aware even exist.  In a separate section consisting of 14 pages she focuses on defining Englishness and attempts to define Englishness in contrast to being British.<br /><br />Writing with gentle humour and astute perception she portrays the foibles in the English and in herself as well. Kate Fox is immensely perceptive about all kinds of English cultural values, behaviours and oddities. Watching the English falls into two main parts: part one - Conversation codes; part two - Behaviour codes.  The first part covers everything from the obsession with the weather through English humour to how people use mobile phones. The second part deals with how the English behave inside their own homes or when visiting other people's homes, life in the workplace, food, drink, eating-habits, sex... and many more topics.<br /><br />Though the smallish print might irritate some, it's an easy read with good flow and the reader will get much material to provoke lively discussion with anyone interested in the English.<br /><br />Anthropologist Kate Fox, has forced herself to engage in many humiliating field tests-- like bumping into people on purpose and seeing how many people say `sorry'-- in order to test the common theories about English behaviour. Watching the English is the result of her research. 'Fox's book displays most of the traits that she points out as representing the English: being sensitive to the tiny signifiers of class status (e.g. the `M&S test', which identifies your class by your shopping choices at that particular department store), it purposely avoids taking itself too seriously and is continuously self-deprecating (of course, this is the `popular anthropology', not the real scientific one). Admitting to being neither, Watching the English is positioned between satire and science.<br /><br />Warmly recommended for anyone from another culture, who tries to survive living in Britain, or live among the English abroad. People working in international teams with English members or bosses would have many aha-insights through this book.hoices at that particular department store), it purposely avoids taking itself too seriously and is continuously self-deprecating (of course, this is the `popular anthropology', not the real scientific one).

B0006GVJEE|5.0|One of my favorite movies. Story of a likeable, gullable,  professional hitman (Leon)who's really, really good at his job. Natalie Portman is a 9 year old who's just lost her parents to a hit.  Leon reluctantly helps to keep her from the people who killed her parents.<br /><br />The primary character trying to take her out is a cop who's one of the most psycho, ruthless characters you'll see.<br /><br />It's a bang, bang, shoot-em up guy movie, with a softer side as Natalie Portman wants to adopt him as her \\"new\\" family; and Leon turns his attention from his job to helping her.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|I think \\"My December\\" is actually pretty great. On her last 2 albums, the sound was very mixed. It was apparent she was working with several producers who were trying to craft hits. Don't get me wrong, her past material includes some classics, but this new stuff is music in the form of art. Whether or not you like it, it seems the girl knows what she wants and will do just that. It does have some big pop numbers - including \\"One Minute\\" and \\"How I Feel\\" - which I could see making a big splash on the pop charts. But the rest of the album is a bit harder, a bit harsher and not AS mainstream - however, it IS a pop/rock record. The mood of the CD changes as you go along and it flows very nicely. \\"Haunted,\\" a tune about a friends' suicide, is followed by my new favorite chill song \\"Be Still,\\" which is quite positive and relaxing. For those who are bitching 'n complaining about the sound of this album, they need to actually stop and listen to it. It is not that far from \\"Breakaway\\" but so much more. She may not give pop radio a years' worth of hit singles but she is pleasing those who enjoy her voice and music so much more.
B000DWMYQ8|4.0|Some of it is a little ridiculous to absurd and that is why the movie is \\"cute\\".  The writers definitely had to stretch their imagination too much to come up with some of the ideas in the film; yet it was an interesting take on the Chicken Little story. It does keep you interested. When you find out certain things your reaciton is \\"Oh you've got to be kidding\\".  There are some very funny scenes, particularly towards the end.  You've gotta like the Chicken Little at the end, he's COOL!  I will watch it again and probably include it in my library for my young children to watch.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|With so many reviews, I don't believe I can add anything more. This is a breathtaking series: as fascinating, inspiring and moving as anything I have ever seen. You absolutely must OWN this - it holds itself well through repeated viewings.

0743298020|2.0|This book bored me to tears. The characters were flat and there was not enough intrigue to keep me interesred in their lives. In short, I stopped reading  about 1/3 the way through because it was becoming more of a chore than a pleasure to read it. Don't get me wrong, the author's use of the English language is beautiful and I enjoyed reading her prose. What I did not enjoy was the story.

0099771810|2.0|Ok, I admit I had to do a dictionary search on the word \\"pastoral.\\"  I was hoping that if I understood what the title was trying to betray that it would be more likely that I would understand the point of the book.  So, \\"pastoral\\" is referring to a simple, idyllic life.  I gather then that Roth is trying to show a contradiction of the view of American life as simple and idyllic.  I get it, but why was the book so uninteresting.  Maybe the contradiction was not strong enough.  I believe the problem stems from the fact that the story really doesn't have a plot, so we are rolling around where there is no real conflict point or destination to our reading.  If I got the point in a simple dictionary search and that point was not expanded by the story then all I needed from this book was the cover.  The cover is pretty cool so I will give it 5 stars, too bad the story got in the middle of it.
B000P7V45S|5.0|NOTE: The following review deals exclusively with the sound quality of the new 2007 reissue of the album.  For an extensive analysis of the album, see my review of the 1994 edition.    An event recently took place that many of us have been waiting (sleeplessly) for ever since 1994: The entire Genesis catalog is in the process of being remastered, and the charge has been taken up by none other than the masters of remastering, Rhino Records!  When I heard this, I was absolutely floored.  After all, it has been now 13 years since the Genesis albums have been touched, and while Yes, King Crimson, Jethro Tull, and even Kansas have been available in remastered editions since the turn of the millennium, Genesis has been completely overlooked...until now.    Unfortunately, it's not all rosy and peachy.  Unlike some reissues, yes, you definitely will notice the difference between the new and old versions.  And that's the problem.  By no means were the 1994 Genesis remasters perfect; in fact, some of them are downright pitiful.  'A Trick of the Tail' was one of the better ones, though there were several glaring problems that needed to be solved with the sound.  Incidentally, these have been totally fixed in the 2007 reissue.  But, alas, it's the other changes that complicate the matter.    Below is an itemized list of what's right with this remaster, and what's wrong with it:      What's RIGHT with 'A Trick of the Tail' (1976/r. 2007):    1) Hey!  I get it now! - Throughout the album, the vocals are much clearer.  Passages that seemed muffled and unfocused are now much easier to understand, even without the aid of already knowing the lyrics.  This was a weakness of Phil Collins's vocals all the way up to the 1980 'Duke' release, and I'm glad to say Rhino did a great job maximizing what they had to work with.  Listen to \\"Squonk,\\" for instance, and you can actually follow the tale perfectly.    2) Cutting through the mix - If there was one thing that was lacking in the 1994 issue of the album, it was that the overall sound was very crowded.  The 2007 reissue fixes this, though at the expense of a loss of some of the overall feel of the album (see the next section).  Vocals are separated from the instrumentation better than ever before, and the guitars in particular are heard loud and clear (again, see below).  Complex mixes of instrumental textures are resolved much more nicely than in the 1994 issue.    3) It doesn't hurt anymore - There were some particularly grating siblants (\\"esss\\" sounds) in the 1994 reissue, most noticeable in \\"Mad Man Moon.\\"  These have been handily dealt with in the Rhino remaster.    4) Backing him up - The background vocals are more spacious and clear than ever before, and solo and ensemble vocal selections contrast very nicely now.  This is best heard, again, in \\"Mad Man Moon.\\"      What's WRONG with this reissue:    1) Where are the bloody keyboards?! - Steve Hackett is a great guitarist.  Please don't misunderstand me.  But I really don't want to hear *every single note he ever strummed in his life* blasting away with all the subtlety of a jackhammer.  Especially when it means that the keyboard parts, particularly the Mellotron, are completely drowned out.  For instance, listen to the hypnotic ending section of \\"Entangled.\\"  Most of its charm is from that dark, haunting keyboard solo that proceeds to the end of the piece, backed by deep bass notes and a wash of heavily-processed Mellotron chorus.  Many of you were probably not even aware that Hackett does strum a few notes here and there at the end, but if you listen to the 2007 remaster, it is utterly impossible to miss it.  Of course, something had to give, and that is the Mellotron chorus, which is so muted that until the very end of the song you probably wouldn't even know it was there.  This sort of thing happens all over in these reissues (it's much worse in the following album, 1977's 'Wind & Wuthering'), and it's a jarring and, in my opinion, detrimental alteration to the sonic character of the album.    Say what you will about my comments here; I really don't care.  As I said, Hackett was a great guitarist, and Genesis really fell apart as a progressive act when he left.  But the music just sounds wrong with his work showcased in the manner of the 2007 remaster.  Your miles will vary, and the degree to which the keyboards are muted varies across the album as well, but for me, I say this was a real mistake that undermines the musical cohesion expressed by the band during this time.    2) If I wanted to hear a live performance... - On several of the songs, most notably \\"Dance On A Volcano\\" and \\"Squonk,\\" there is a copious amount of echoing, stadium-style delay applied to the vocals and guitars.  Along with the way the drums were EQ'ed throughout the album (a lot of bottom and top end, with the midranges muted), these songs especially sound like the engineers were trying to make them sound live.  This just won't do.  Apart from being inconsistent with the remainder of the album, the \\"live\\" ambiance just doesn't suit this music.    3) It ain't the 80s, guys - Throughout the album, it seems as though the engineers were trying to bring the overall sonic character more in line with the 80s Collins-era albums.  As a result, something very special about the pair of albums released in 1976--'Trick' and 'Wind'--is utterly lost.  This effect is much more apparent in the 2007 remaster of 'Wind' than on 'Trick,' but it can be heard in \\"Squonk\\" and \\"Dance On A Volcano\\" in particular.  There was a very particular sound about 'A Trick of the Tail,' a more intimate, analog cast, that is pulverized by the cold edge of 80s-style digitization.  Again, this is down to personal preference, but I think the 1994 release really captured the warm, analog tone of this album much better.      Overall, this Rhino version of 'A Trick of the Tail' sounds *very* different from the 1994 release.  Some of the changes were welcome, but more of them (at least in my opinion) were wholly unwelcome.  Many if not all the major issues with the 1994 release were fixed, but the new version has many new issues of its own.  I can't help but feel that Rhino really dropped the ball here, and I am really disappointed with this work.  It looks as though we're going to have to wait another decade or so before somebody comes along and gets it right.  The thing that dismays me, though, is that I always had faith in Rhino.  I guess I was just proved wrong.    Like I said, opinions will vary widely.  My suggestion to prospective buyers is to buy both versions (1994 and 2007) of any one of the classic output of Collins-era Genesis, choose which one you think sounds better, and then complete the set from that version.  I will get a lot of hateful comments (\\"How dare you insult Steve Hackett!\\"), but my opinion will not change.  I have made a compromise with this review by rating the 2007 remasters the same way I have rated the 1994 ones (the ratings are based on the album content), but I have included my exclusive comments on the 2007 reissue quality.  My purpose is to serve as an adviser to any who are considering purchasing this edition, either as an upgrade or as your first copy.  Whichever version sounds better to you is ultimately your decision, and I wish you all the best with it.  Rhino just didn't do it for me here.    Better luck next time.
B0001KZM3O|1.0|Upon listening to some of these samples, I realize now how embarassingly introverted and unrewarding this album always was. While The Wall ultimately succeeded in projecting the narcissism of the jaded rock and roller into a phantasmagoria of paranoid self-delusion, here the listener is forced to identify with Roger Waters' intimate and outlandish self pity and absurd free association of ideas (Jesus was crucified, and guilty me, I watched too much TV...) whispered in carefully phrased pseudo-ironic fashion over dull funereal orchestral moanings... While the title cut recalls Comfortably Numb musically, its dramatic recollection (invention?) of a near-suicide by Waters comes accross less as an inspired moment than as a cynical attempt to force the listener once and for all to identify wholly the classic Pink Floyd sound with his navel-gazing or else...
B000K7UBTI|5.0|I hope to see more Marvel movies like this of all the charactors. This was a good intro to \\"IronMan\\" for those who know very little about him or his origin. For those who are VERY familiar with the comic and story it was a little skinny. But all in all it was fun and a good start. Hopefully it is the beginning of many more to come.
B000P2A256|5.0|I didn't know this band before I bought their CD on Amazon. I clicked on the sample musics link on the Amazon site and listened to a few of their songs, they sound alright to me, so I bought it. Now that I \\"owned\\" one (oh yeah, Amazon shipping service was excellent), gosh, I have been playing their songs in my car almost everyday! This is definitly one of the best CDs I bought in this year !   My favorite: #1, #2, #4, #5, #6, #7
0441172717|5.0|I love reading good sci-fi because of its innovation and imagination.  This book has both.  The description of stil suits and the complex economy developed on spice are both examples of Herbert's ability to create.  You also get amazing adventure and worms the size of semi's.  And for those with a political interest, you get the back stabbing and dealing of an empire.  Where could you go wrong.  Well I found out in the next couple books of this series.
B00005JLSE|2.0|After many years of wanting to see this film, I finally got a chance to view it. I like musicals and loved Moulin Rouge, so I thought I'd give this one a try. However, after viewing, I was a bit puzzled at all the fuss and acclaim this movie received and continues to receive.     Chicago, while visually stunning and artistically impressive (in that the actors did their own singing), is a shallow, cynical, superficial, and unsympathetic story. Most movies rely upon story and plot for their strength; not so Chicago, whose only redeeming quality is the song and dance they put on.     The main problem with the story is that there are virtually no sympathetic main characters. To take that a step further, the main characters are all frauds, and the story's message is shallow. The two somewhat redeeming characters, Roxie's husband and the woman who is hanged, are both pretty much invisible and discarded in the film. Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly are both in jail for murder, and both have hopes and dreams of making it, being a big star, and having people adore them, so they call upon a slimebag attorney, Billy Flynn, to help them out. Roxie and Velma take turns lying and deceiving each other so they can get the fame in Chicago. Roxie openly admits she cheated on her husband, is oblivious to the fact that he's spent his life savings to get her a lawyer, and uses every trick in the book  (including pretending that she has an illegitimate child) to ensure that she is the center of the newspaper headlines. Velma is a conceited fame-hungry snob who bribes the prison ward and only sucks up to Roxie when she realizing she is losing the fame war. From here we have a battle over popularity, as the two think of shenanigans to steal the headlines from each other. Who will win out? Who cares.     The message basically projected in this film is that its legitimate to whatever it takes to get ahead in this world--lie, cheat, steal, commit adultery--and, in fact, it might make you a star!Are we are suppose to root for two back-stabbing, deceitful, murderesses who walk over people just to get their claim to fame all because they can sing and dance? Or how about a double-crossing, pompous, lying, money-hungry lawyer looking for the next damsel charged with murder? No thanks. I say throw them all in jail.     Watching this film, I found it mystifying how so many people and critics could love this movie so much. Granted the story's plot has probably changed from the musical version on stage, but the movie version falls quite short of its glowing reviews. Moreover, how could this film have received six Oscars in 2002? I liken the Oscar committee of 2002 to the gullible Chicago citizens in the film, falling over and swooning at something that puts on a little song and dance. Maybe Chicago was the Academy Award's apology for Moulin Rouge not getting any Oscars the previous year.     If you want to see a musical that is vastly superior, has heart, style and substance, and better acting, see Moulin Rouge.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|Well many will and I am sure have said that this album sucks. Now you have to listen to it the same way I explain my friends they should listen to it \\"try to pretend that its not linkin park\\". The reason is because if you want to listen to it with the ears from the first album and meteora it is very diffrent. They said them selfs the wanted to step out from the Nu-metal scenario (atleast Chester did confirm that) and well by doing it they changed a lot of what many of us already like. What I could not understand why did I find a similarity to The Rasmus in a couple of songs from the album specially the first single that debuted. I think in a way they wanted to attrack diffrent type of fans but again could go against them since it could push away the original fans. My point is, its a good album and it would be an excellent debut album for a band that wasn't Linkin Park. You can also feel a little separation from Chester and Mike. Now they don't sing that much together, one song those kind of the work but its not the same punch as \\"in the end\\" or \\"point of authority\\". In the end to me it gets a 4 star and like I said it would of gotten 5 stars if it wasn't under the name Linkin Park.
B00005J79J|5.0|Like all music of Sara Brightman. it's absolute quality. She has a voice that is so flexible, that she can sing nearly al kind of music from Clasical up to hard rock. Besides this she is also a first class performer.
B0002NRQTS|5.0|4.5 stars    1989's \\"Presto\\" was the band's 13th studio album and marked the beginning of a new direction for the band.  The use of synthesizers, which were used heavily on the previous four albums, were scaled back dramatically and guitars were brought back to the forefront.  While this act could be interpreted as the band returning to their roots, the sound on \\"Presto\\" is still miles away from the band's 70's sound.  This was the beginning of a new sound for Rush; a sound they would continue to work on throughout the 90's.     \\"Presto\\" is quite possibly the most underrated and overlooked album in the entire Rush catalogue.  It is one of the band's worst selling albums.  However, despite the lack of popularity, \\"Presto\\" is simply a classic Rush release.  It is an extremely capable and solid album throughout.  There are no standout \\"super-hits\\" on this one, which is probably why it isn't a more popular album, but tracks like \\"The Pass,\\" \\"Red Tide,\\" and \\"Available Light,\\" are some of Rush's best songs to date.  Anyone avoiding this album simply because it doesn't contain mega-popular songs like \\"Tom Sawyer\\" and \\"Subdivisions\\" is truly missing out.      \\"Presto\\" is a transitional album.  Traces of \\"Hold Your Fire\\" are still here and are mixed in with the new sound being developed.  Like most transitional albums, consistency is an issue.  Some of the songs here, like \\"Scars,\\" are so different that they almost sound out of place.  Indeed, there are some \\"funky\\" and \\"jazzy\\" elements in \\"Presto\\" that have not been heard before on previous efforts.  These elements hint at what the band was planning for their next couple of albums (Roll the Bones, specifically.) This makes \\"Presto\\" one of the most diverse Rush albums.  This diversity will explain the polarizing and mixed reviews of the album.  Some will love it, some will hate it.  Luckily I fall into the former and not the latter.      1)Show Don't Tell - This is the best known song from this album, even though it didn't quite reach the status of a \\"hit.\\" The first 16 seconds will lead you to believe the band is continuing in the same direction as \\"Power Windows\\" and \\"Hold Your Fire,\\" and then BAM! Lifeson's guitar breaks through with a powerful \\"funky\\" riff.  Complete with the band's signature tempo-changes and melody, this song flat-out rocks.  The \\"bass-lite\\" production becomes apparent during the passages in this song.  When Geddy Lee starts plugging away on the bass, it sounds notably lighter than it used to.  This is attributed to the new producer.  The remastered version improves this problem somewhat, but not completely.  Still, a great song. 9/10    2)Chain Lightning - Starts off with an ethereal synth riff that quickly gives way to a haunting guitar riff.  Great melodic vocals, catchy chorus, excellent guitar work.  Although a fairly mellow song, I appreciate the heavy riffs thrown in by Lifeson.  It keeps it very interesting.  Another great song.  8/10    3)The Pass - Wow. This has got to be one of Rush's best songs.  Some of the best, most poignant lyrics ever written by Peart, beautiful song melodies, and powerfully emotional vocals.  Even those who don't like this album love this one.  The band has stated that this is one of their favorite songs to perform live. Simply incredible.  10/10.    4)War Paint - A solid song, though not as memorable as some of the others.  Catchy chorus, nice use of the piano, great riffing by Lifeson. On par with \\"Chain Lightning.\\" 8/10.      5)Scars - The opening bass riff gives this song a jazz-fusion sound. The drumming is almost tribal at times.  Synthesizer is used to give the song an atmospheric effect. A very unique song, to say the least. Admittedly, I did not like this song the first time I heard it.  After repeated listens, it started to grow on me.   It still isn't one of my favorites on here, but I like its uniqueness and atmospheric qualities. 7/10    6)Presto - Starts off slower than I'd like it to.  The opening line \\"If I couldwave my magic wand\\" made me roll my eyes upon first listening.  Geddy's vocal performance shines brightly in this song.  At about the 2 minute mark the song gets going at a good pace.  At 3 minutes, the song gets faster and heavier.  Great drumming, excellent acoustic guitar from Lifeson.  Again, great vocal performance.  This ends up being a strong performer.  8/10    7)Superconductor - Probably my least favorite on here. Although one of the heaviest songs on here, it is more or less a generic rock song.  It is also a little too repetitive for me personally.  The background vocals during the chorus are also kind of annoying.  6/10    8)Anagram (For Mongo) - The title is a reference to \\"Blazing Saddles.\\"  Nice touch.  Anyway, I like this song.  It isn't a standout track by any means, but it is melodic with a catchy chorus.  For some reason, I am reminded of Genesis when I hear the chorus.  It's a nice, mellow, middle-of-the-album song. 8/10    9)Red Tide - After the first few seconds of the piano intro, I actually said \\"This song has potential.\\"  I was right.  I simply can't believe that this song wasn't a big hit when it was released.  Without question, one of the strongest tracks on \\"Presto.\\"  This song sounds like it could have been on \\"Grace Under Pressure.\\"  The style is very close, in my opinion.  Anyway, I love this song. Beautiful use of the piano, extremely catchy chorus, intelligent and relevant lyrics. 10/10    10)Hand Over Fist - This song deals with the topic of \\"Rock, Paper, Scissors.\\"  I give this song points for originality, but it isn't one of the best songs on here.  The chorus is very repetitive throughout the song.  Great vocal delivery by Geddy Lee.  Overall, not bad, just not great.  7/10      11)Available Light - An amazing way to end an album.  This song might have the best chorus of any song on here.  \\"Available Light\\" sums up the album perfectly.  The song itself is a diverse and beautiful mixture of all the styles present on the album - jazz, synth-pop, and rock.  It all comes together here.  There simply could not be a more perfect ending to this album.  One of their best songs ever.  10/10    So, although not all the songs here are perfect, the good far outweighs the bad.  This album deserves a lot more respect than it gets.  \\"Presto\\" contains some of Rush's very best work.  Although some tracks are better than others, there are no \\"bad\\" songs on here at all. If given a fair chance, I'm convinced that \\"Presto\\" will end up being one of your favorites as well.  It may not be as immediately impressive as \\"Permanent Waves\\" and \\"Moving Pictures,\\" but it will grow on you.      Note: If you are new to Rush, I do not recommend making this your first purchase.  Start off with \\"Permanent Waves\\" or \\"Moving Pictures\\" and then branch off from there.  However, make sure you have this in your collection eventually.  It is a must have Rush release.
B000001GQY|5.0|Gilels is excellent on this classic recording of the Brahms Piano Concertos. Before these recordings came out of CD, I listened to these on LP records for hours and hours.  I wore those records out.<br /><br />The added bonus on the CD of the Fantasia is nice as well.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|I saw this movie back in December of 97. I had knowledge of the Titanic and I asked myself 'Do we really need another movie about this subject? James Cameron did  a remarkable job and I loved this movie. The 3 disc DVD-let me suggest that any budding filmmaker rather young, in between or old should purchase this DVD. Cameron gives great insight on how to make a movie. The precise and intricate planning,his great writing.His technical expertise and great cinematography. A hands on director no doubt. He can do it all. He is a well educated and intelligent man that knows how to work. Unlike alot of them these days who got their big positions based on who they were related to. Filmakers should pay close attention to his subject on pacing, as a writer myself, the advice on this technique is still the same. I learned quite a bit.<br /><br />Thank You James Cameron for this fantastic DVD.<br /><br />Pamela
B000NVIXFK|5.0|Talk about a new direction for Rush - just be Rush. What an amazing album! It seems that the producer, Nick Raskulinecz (Foo Fighters, Velvet Revolver) is a Rush fan himself, and decided to just let the boys play. Funny concept for Rush: just be Rush. And when Rush is being themselves, one heck of an album emerges, grounded with excellent lyrics, awesome playing, and instrumentals! Lots of instrumentals on this disc. While Vapor Trails was a great album, this album just feels like they could be themselves. Some people may not like it, but quite frankly I think its some of their best work in years. Maybe not a good place to start for a first Rush album purchase, but definitely a great place to come to once you've listened to everything else they've produced. Well done, gentlemen, well done.

B000MNP2KI|4.0|This movie really rocked out on the action parts, which is about 95% of the movie.  Even the poker playing scene is really exciting :)  But Daniel Craig who looks like a great Bond plays it like he's a cardboard cut out!  It's like he's got no spark!  The suaveness and coolness that the original Bond's had is really missing and in this movie it's more about running and shooting than anything else.  BUT they did make all that running and shooting really fun to watch :)<br /><br />Very enjoyable movie, but they need to replace Daniel Craiq with a Better Bond.  Heck, bring back Sean Connery.  He may be 200 years old but have you seen what they can do with makeup these days?

B000NVIXFK|3.0|Rush has been a guilty pleasure of mine for years.  This disc sounds too much like the last two.  I am not impressed.
B000OZ2CZW|5.0|I'll be the first to admit Rihanna has failed to really make an impression on me the past two years of her short career. Yes Pon De Replay was kind of fun, and SOS was catchy at first but grew old fast, but listening to most of her songs from her first two albums just felt like sifting through mediocre pop/R&B filler tracks that Beyonce rejected. Then a few months ago I start hearing this song called \\"Umbrella\\", and all it took was one listen for me to know I was completely hooked on it. \\"Umbrella\\" is one of the most purely catchy and addictive pop songs I've heard in a very long time with its hook of unusual repetition in the word umbrella. After finding out the song was Rihanna's new single, I was legitimately interested in her for the first time, and knew I had to check out the album that brought us \\"Umbrella\\", which to no surprise has gone onto become the biggest worldwide hit of 2007 so far. However, I still had fairly low expectations, as I figured Umbrella would probably be the only worthwhile song on the set, as like I already mentioned Rihanna's past two albums have consisted of mostly filler songs in my opinion.     Well I'm happy to say I was completely wrong. \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" is a breakthrough album for Rihanna, not only in the fact that nearly every song could be a hit single, but also because here she's beginning to really find her own voice among all the other Beyonce wannabes. Indeed whether she's taking lessons or has just naturally improved, there's no doubt that her voice is far superior here to what it was on her first two albums, and charisma and emotion are finally starting to come through in her songs. No she's no Whitney or Mariah, and she never will be, but \\"Good Girl\\" shows a definite vocal improvement. Couple those improvements with the near perfect production and songwriting choices, and its easy to see why this is the biggest surprise of the year so far to me.     \\"Umbrella\\" is the highlight of the album (it would be mighty hard to top it), but it doesn't overshadow the whole album. Don't Stop the Music, produced by Stargate, gives Umbrella a close run for its money as song of the album and puts her first dance hit, Pon De Replay, to complete shame. With an infectious beat thats near impossible to not want to start dancing to, and a clever use of a sample from Michael Jackson's \\"Wanna Be Startin Something\\", it's no doubt she'll have another huge hit with it, granted its released.     Then there's the unorthodox Sell Me Candy and Lemme Get That, two other album highlights, produced by the insanely popular-at-the-moment Timbaland. These both highlight Rihanna's new found charisma and personality I mentioned that was noticeably absent in her previous material. Sell Me Candy is like bubblegum pop fused with modern R&B, and has a summertime feel to it. The song is also one where the more I listen to it the more I like it. Lemme Get That on the other hand has a reggae touch, and background vocals by Justin Timberlake as Rihanna proclaims in a sassy tone \\"I got a house but I need new furniture, why spend mine when I could spend yers?\\", again Rihanna's finally developing a personality on songs like these.     Rehab is another favorite of mine, also produced by Timbaland, this is one of the slower tempo songs on here, and was written by JT. Rihanna laments over the problems caused by the bad relationship she's in, singing, \\"It's like I checked into rehab, and baby you're my disease.\\"     Other highlights include second single \\"Shut Up and Drive\\", a raunchy fast paced song that uses cars and driving as metaphors for sex, \\"Breakin Dishes\\" yet another potential hit track where Rihanna is ticked off and persists \\"Im'a fight a man tonight\\", and the mellow but pleasant collaboration with Ne-Yo, \\"Hate That I Love You.\\"     \\"Push Up On Me\\", \\"Question Existing\\", and the title track \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" are slightly weaker songs, but are still good non the less, despite the fact that the latter sounds a bit too similar to Beyonce's smash hit \\"Irreplaceable\\". In fact the only song that fails to hit the mark and comes off as filler is the boring \\"Say It.\\"     Overall \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" is the near perfect commercial pop/R&B album, I'd even go as far to say it's comparable to such classic's of the genre as Janet's Rhythm City and MJ's \\"Thriller.\\" Rihanna has suddenly emerged as one of my new favorite current artists of the genre, and I look forward to her next album, where hopefully she'll start taking more creative control and maybe do a little writing. 5/5 stars    My Top 5:  1.Umbrella  2. Don't Stop the Music  3. Sell Me Candy  4. Rehab  5. Lemme Get That
B000Q6GUTI|5.0|I heard from a friend that this movie kicked some serious *** but I hate Mark Wahlberg and put off seeing this for a few weeks.  When I finally got around to the theater to see it I was blown away!  This movie totally rocked!  And Mark Wahlberg was actually good in it!<br /><br />I like conspiracy movies and this had it all.  Tons of action, lots of backstabbing, and a great story that was actually interesting compared to most movies that come out.<br /><br />For the $20 price tag it's worth it - I just hope the extra's are as good as the movie too :)
B000EGCITG|5.0|I never was a fan of hip hop/dance/rap music, so I never really paid attention to Pink.  I'll be the first to admit that was a big mistake.  I heard \\"Who Knew\\" on the radio and was absolutely bowled over!  I immediately went out and bought the album based on that one song.  Turns out the album is full of fantastic musical gems. I didn't realize she changed her style to more of a rock/pop style.  \\"Stupid Girls\\" is a great social statement (and totally made me think of Paris Hilton).  \\"Who Knew\\" is one of my favorite songs of all times.  \\"Long Way to Happy\\" is so catchy and awesome, it's my 2nd fave on the album. \\"Nobody Knows\\", \\"Dear Mr. President\\" and \\"I Got Money Now\\" are all great slowed down songs.  I almost cried the first time I heard \\"Dear Mr. President\\".  Extremely political and so very true, beautifully sung and deserves a lot of attention.  \\"U + Ur Hand\\" and \\"Leave me Alone\\" are fun and full of attitude.    I'd like to add that not only is this album awesome, but I finally found out that Pink is an incredible vocalist and performer.  Based on that, I ended up buying Misunduztood and there are several songs on that album I loved as well.   I just wish I had noticed Pink long before this!  Buy the album, you won't be disappointed!
0316067598|5.0|Everyone in AMERICA needs to read this book. This should be required reading in every high school! Americans need to know the enormous sacrifice the men and women of our Armed Services make daily to ensure their continued freedom!!! This gift of freedom is costly and it saddens my heart to watch our current generation of teens move further away from patriotism than any generation in the history of our great country. And to those of you who want to give Marcus grief for expressing his feelings about liberals.....he lived it, he wrote.... screw you! I am the proud, no extremely proud mother of a US Navy SEAL who is currently in Iraq. I have watched the memorial services for the men lost in this battle. I have grieved for the families and I have grieved for Marcus and the unimaginable burden he will carry for the duration of his amazing life. How dare ANYONE be arrogant enough to criticize him for ANYTHING he wished to express in HIS story. Please read this book. I've purchase 5 copies for my local library. Hoo-freakin-Yah!!!!
B00005JPHT|5.0|Ok, call me crazy but I will admit in public I LOVE MICHAEL MOORE MOVIES. Now that I have put that on the table... Loved the movie. I hope it starts change in this country on the health care issue.
B000MXPE7O|1.0|I like DeNiro, I like Damon, and I really like conspiracy movies.  So I was really hyped to see this.  Than I did...And it was the most boring movie I've ever seen!!!  How can DeNiro who's been so fun to watch for the past 20 years and Matt Damon who I loved in the Ocean's 11, 12, and 13 movies suck it up so bad in this?  Now the acting is really great and that's about the only redeeming quality about this movie, but I didn't see it to see great acting.  I wanted to be entertained and this movie really didn't help there.<br /><br />If you see it, than make sure your not sitting comfortably because your going to fall asleep.  I did about 1 hour in and than woke up 5 mintues later to see that nothing exciting was happening and I fell back to sleep.
B000002UA5|5.0|If you are interested in this album on the least it probably means that you have heard plenty of Floyd already.  This is not a starter kind of album.  The studio portion is weird and experimental and just a blast to listen to.  Not to mention that crazy song that's title is a whole story unto itself. The animals, the cave, the grooving and the pict.    As for the Live half. It is just far and away the better CD of this set.  I listen to this as much as I do Dark Side of the Moon.  It is very good.  You get to hear another perspective of the Syd Barrett song Astronomy Domine.  And a live version of Careful with that Axe Eugene.  Aw you know what all 4 tracks are just flat out awesome!  Get it if you liked Piper at the Gates of Dawn, Meddle, Saucerful of Secrets,  or More. It follows a similar flow and sound, that sound being of the best (ish) band ever.
B000OCXFCO|4.0|Great CD all around. long awaited album deliver's all the goods of old school megadeth. I totally recommend to any metal fan
B000BISBDY|5.0|Johnny Cash's music and popularity has transcended generations and genres.  His fans consist of people like myself who don't care much for the current crop of country artists that Nashville is promoting,younger fans who were introduced to his music through excellent covers of Soundgarden and Nine Inch Nails tunes and longtime country fans.  With a career that lasted as long as his it's hard to narrow his material down to one CD but this collection does a good job.  You get his early stuff with the Tennessee Two (\\"Cry, Cry, Cry\\", \\"Folsum Prison Blues\\", \\"Get Rhythm\\") his middle era (\\"Man In Black\\",\\"Sunday Morning Coming Down\\", \\"A Boy Named Sue\\")and his amazing comeback on the Rick Rubin \\"American Recordings\\" (\\"Rusty Cage\\", \\"Hurt\\"(dare I say this is better than the NIN version), \\"Delia's Gone\\"). All in all an excellent overview of a legendary career.
B00005O3VC|2.0|I've seen this movie 4 times now and ever since the first time I sit there wondering \\"What the heck do people think is funny in this movie\\" - Than I realized that if I had been high when I watched it this movie probably would have been hilarious!  That's actually a good thing because than I could have some killer food and laugh at this stuff even though usually I'd just turn it off lol
1594489505|5.0|I read \\"The Kite Runner\\" within the last two weeks. Certainly, this author can't strike gold twice in a row? Yes, he can. Yes, he did.     A Thousand Splendid Suns takes place before and after the Taliban regime. Two women living in different worlds with completely different lives find themselves together married to the same brutal individual. Their paths now crossed they eventually will become close in a world gone mad.     I do not want to give away the plot, but know that reading this book will tear at your heart. It will bring tears to your eyes at times and it will make you shudder at the violence that the women face from their husband and from the Taliban. The book will make you feel so many emotions and when you finish the book you will know you have read something that will stay with you a long time.     I cannot recommend this book enough. Khaled Hosseini has struck gold with this book. Read this book.
0743454537|5.0|If you are a sister... read this story.   While anyone who enjoys a well written book will be captivated, mothers, sisters, and daughters  will be especially touched. A must read.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|If you liked their latest music video, then this album should apply to you.  If you thought that it was a little on the soft side, then don't bother buying Minutes to Midnight because I thought the whole album was too soft.  Definitely not the hard hitting rythm and lyrics that earlier albums offered.
B000M5AJQS|4.0|I love Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon and they both kicked butt in this movie, but haven't I seen this almost exact plot line before?  I swear that the same idea's about the same gangster type deals are being recycled out in Hollywood.  While this movie was fun to watch, the tired old \\"Godfather\\" act really losing it's touch.  The original Godfather movies still hold up to today's crap, and even this is enjoyable, but PLEASE make some more unique films!!!
0764113496|1.0|I rented 501 French Verbs from the library.  For each verb it had examples of usage.  The French book also had idiom phrases, quizzes, etc...   Liked it so much I bought it from Amazon.    So I rented 501 Russian Verbs from the library expecting similar content as the French version.  What a difference.  If you really need a book that shows you how to conjugate 501 Russian verbs without context and without examples, this book is for you.       Honestly how can you have a Russian verb book that covers verbs of motions with one or two word English translations.    Completely worthless for learning how to use the verbs.      The differences between perfective and imperfective require examples to begin to make any sense of the usage.    The only reason I can think of for the positive reviews is that it must have been a classroom assignment for extra credit.
0066620996|5.0|Collins is clearly at the top of his game and good at what he does. Plus, he makes it easy for anyone to grasp the concepts in this book despite the extensive research and potential for jargon laden discourse.<br /><br />This is a prequel to Built To Last ([...]) and outlines systematically and methodically how companies moved from average performance to sustained and outstanding success. Despite what may seem like a narrow topic, Collins manages to offer ideas that anyone can apply to their own character, business, family, institution etc.<br /><br />What fascinated me most is the chats and interviews he had with the people behind the companies. There is treasure, not just in the raw data and strategy revealed, but in the wisdom and character of the personalities exposed. There is an unquestionable consistency and pattern that emerges as he draws a convincing line from good to great success.<br /><br />An excellent book that proves Collins himself is a example of his own work.
B0000YEEHG|5.0|One of the director's more surreal, experimental works, \\"Persona\\" is an intriguing study of mental illness, role reversal, and the somewhat hazy boundary separating one individual identity from another. In the poetic opening shots culled from old reels, Bergman makes us aware we are watching a film, but the story itself derives emotional intensity from Bibi Andersson's Alma, who becomes ever more vulnerable the deeper she plumbs her life experience. \\"Persona\\" is a spooky, mind-bending film that casts a unique spell.
B000BYA5GO|5.0|This by far is one of the BEST movies to come out in the past 10 years.  Although the movie house probably made more money selling popcorn than from Lord of War ticket sales, this stands out as an EXTREMELY great and relevant film.<br /><br />Unlike most crap that comes out today, Lord of War actually makes you feel for all of the characters, especially at the end where your left with the sense that Nick Cage's characther is going through the same emotions you are.<br /><br />Totally loved this movie and now CineMax is playing it almost everyday :)  The extra's on the 2nd Disc aren't that great, so just pick up the Widescreen Version - You'll love it :)
B00005JPQT|5.0|I'm a huge Die Hard fan as are most warm-blooded males, and my biggest fear was that this would just be another modern actioner with John McClane in it, but not a DH movie per-se. Well, thankfully, those fears couldn't have been more unfounded. This is definitely a DH movie, and what's more is it's the best action movie I've seen in a long time (which any DH movie worth making should be). Bruce Willis is truly the greatest action hero pretty much ever, and he reminded me of that constantly during this film. Now, some of the action is silly to say the least (the F-25 jet versus truck scene instantly comes to mind), but the movie never takes itself too seriously, and everything is well staged and executed. The PG-13 rating makes little difference, and I honestly can't believe they got away with it cuz this is one hard-hitting action thriller. Trust me, nice and violent even by DH standards. Also,I honestly wouldn't have minded a little more of McClane's signature overuse of the F-bomb, but there are some great lines and it's not exactly profanity-lite. Either way, this is a true summer movie and a true Die Hard movie! So if you like both of those things and aren't looking for depth and realism, but just a damn good time at the movies, then this is your ticket. Of all of the sequels and blockbusters this summer worth mentioning or seeing (or lack thereof), I can honestly say that Yippee-Ki-Yay is the way!
0783240236|5.0|Undoubtedly one of Hitchcock's scariest films, the special effects are surprisingly effective for the time; you may never look at our winged friends quite the same again. Rod Taylor is stolid in a role Cary Grant might have done ten years prior, and Tippi Hedren is suitably intriguing as the icy blonde who's a magnet for men--and birds. The scene where Melanie sees the birds gradually build up on the playground jungle gym remains one of Hitch's most inspired and creepy set-pieces.
B000OVLBEO|3.0|The above is something I'd say about a bad video game and Ghost Rider is right about between \\"OK\\" and \\"Why did I see this?\\".  I usually love Nicholas Cage and his Lord of War is one of my Top 10 movies of all time.  But this Ghost Rider thing just seemed to be more of a showoff of neat CGI graphics than anything else.<br /><br />Now I did like the action and it kept me entertained so it had that \\"special something\\" that a lot of movies lack.  So when I finished it I had totally enjoyed my experience, but the only thing I'll watch on the DVD is the extra's.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|I really don't get some of the reviews out there. I think most of the songs on this album are catchy. But what makes them great is that they are catchy with substance. Why do people think this isn't Top 40 material or appropriate for mainstream? There are so many artists and songs out there that deal with \\"darker\\" issues that have made a tremendous success of them.    I also don't understand why it was such a big deal for Kelly to make this album. Christian Aguilera took her career into her hands, took risks, and soared! Kelly will do the same thing.    This album is great. I was hooked the moment I heard Never Again on the radio and fell in love when I heard Sober. Kelly, you rock and I hope you keep this up! We NEED music like THIS. Not the brainless drivel that the music industry shoves down our throats all the time.
B00004RF83|5.0|Two years after \\"The Manchurian Candidate,\\" director Frankenheimer scored again with this gripping political thriller. Beyond serving as a showcase for two frequently paired stars- Lancaster as power-mad general, Douglas as principled whistle-blower--the movie works because in the context of the paranoic Cold War era, the premise feels all-too-plausible. Stark black-and-white photography and brisk pacing only add to the film's breathless tension.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|Forget about Australia fining Stallone for steroids!  If he can make Rambo 4 as good as Rocky Balboa than I'm sold!<br /><br />This movie really took me by surprise.  I heard the premise and laughed my butt of!  It sounds so stupid that I was suprised they made this movie, but I'm really glad they did :)<br /><br />Stallone really makes you feel for and root for Rocky the whole way through.  To see all the crap he's been through physically, emotionally, etc...  really gets you feeling for the Rock.<br /><br />And by the end you get this feeling that both you and Rocky and going through the same emotions.  That connection that Stallone makes with the audience is rare in this day of film, and he does it so well that this may be his crowing achievement.<br /><br />I really hope Rambo 4 is as good as this :)
0783225849|5.0|Made at the peak of his career in 1960, \\"Psycho\\" was suspense master Hitchcock's last and most famous black-and-white picture--and a film that inaugurated the sub-genre of slasher movie. By the standards of today's gore-fests, it's a fairly restrained murder mystery, but disturbing nonetheless, achieving its chills more by what is withheld than shown. Hitchcock knows just how to heighten our dread of who or what might be at the top of the stairs, or beyond that shower curtain. The terrifying \\"Psycho\\" stands above most any psychological thriller made since.
B000J10ERO|4.0|Superman Returns was mostly pretty good.  I really enjoyed about 90% of the movie except for some boring parts that could have been left out on the cutting room floor lol.  I know that a lot of movies these days are just BANG-BANG action flicks so I might be getting too used to them.<br /><br />Overall this movie was pretty good and if you can get it for a good price than it's worth it for the 2 Disc Set
B0001CNRB6|5.0|Delbert Mann's follow-up to Hudson-Day's first hit \\"Pillow Talk\\" is less well-known, but every bit as good. Rock in particular shines in two separate characterizations, and Randall's elevator scene must be seen to be believed. Fast and sharp, with a vibrant early sixties look and feel, \\"Lover\\" will keep you coming back. Hooray for Vip!
B000002N2Z|4.0|This debut album from the Deftones is a raw, aggressive mix of thrashing guitars and hollow dyna vocals. The album doesn't have many soft spots and plays through like watching a horror movie on Halloween.    Much more stripped down, with less texture and guitar layerings than subsequent Deftones offerings---Adrenaline is rooted more as a hardcore punk record than anything---albeit a smart and provacative punk record.    This was the album that introduced the world to one of the most innovative and beautiful hard rock bands of our time, introduced a new style of soft to loud and a vocal that's as brutal as it is beautiful.    It's hard to skip over any tracks on Adrenaline--but the real standouts have to be: root, 7 words, engine number 9, fireal and birthmark.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|Disney's triumph expertly blends live-action and animation, and boasts a delightful score by the Sherman Brothers, including \\"A Spoonful Of Sugar\\", \\"Chim-Chim-Cher-ee\\", and \\"Feed The Birds\\". Veteran troupers Ed Wynn, Reginald Owen and Arthur Treacher lend colorful support, and Van Dyke is an appealing song and dance man, though his Cockney accent fails him. The real draw of course is the irresistible Andrews, who won the Oscar in her first starring role. Best for younger children, and young-at-heart parents.
B000Q6GUTI|1.0|No offense intended to prior reviews - this is my 2 cents.<br /><br />Forget the poor adaptation of the book \\"Point of Impact\\", which was expected, given the technical details of a sniper's craft and the intricate plot line.  This movie is a muddled mess, complete with mumbled dialog and cartoonish characters, from the mis-cast Mark Wahlberg as Bob Lee Swagger, to the buffoonish senator \\"played\\" by Ned Beatty.  And don't get me started on the Danny Glover character.  What a waste of talent.<br /><br />On the other hand, the action sequences were visually appealing . . .<br /><br />Completely, utterly, mindlessly action-oriented movie for the hard-core explosion, gun fight, blood-splattering violence fan.
6301971272|5.0|Widely considered the best of Leone's western trilogy, \\"Good\\" has also been re-mastered to pristine glory, some footage re-inserted, and lines re-dubbed by Eastwood and Wallach. Yes, the film is long, but the three stars, Leone's magic camera, and that Morricone score will hold you hostage throughout. Wallach steals it as Tuco. A spaghetti western worth its weight in gold.
B00005JPKE|5.0|Movie and acting were superb.  Great to have a look from the 'other side.'<br />But was it an accurate view, I don't know.
076781326X|5.0|The considerable talents of British director Carol Reed and composer/lyricist Lionel Bart combine to create an exuberant musical worthy of its revered source. The cast, both young and old, excel, and songs like \\"Consider Yourself\\" and \\"As Long As He Needs Me\\" stand the test of time. \\"Oliver\\" won six Oscars, including Best Picture, a rare feat for a musical. Watch this and you'll say: \\"Please, sir, may I have some more?\\"
B000001ELP|5.0|As a fan from Alive I on, I'm glad to see this album getting some affection. I always liked it and was kinda let down by the band's abandonment of it.<br /><br />I think they bash it because it was an act of desperation at a desperate time, and it reminds them of that. They gambled as if they were running out of chances. I think that drove them to make a much better album than they like to admit to.<br />It's only failure is that they didn't get the boost that they were after. If it had been a hit, they wouldn't have any complaints. If I have any gripes about that period, it was Gene's and Paul's costumes :)(and that those SOBs never came back to Hawaii). Paul looked like he was going to an aerobics class and Gene liked liked he forgot to get dressed...demon longjohns.
B00005ATQH|5.0|A brilliant adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's novel penned by the author himself, Kubrick's \\"Lolita\\" satirizes the vulgar desires and warped intellect of Humbert, magnificently played by Mason. Upgrading Lolita's age to make the film palatable to audiences in 1962, Kubrick emphasized the farcical aspects of the source material, drawing an extraordinary performance from Sellers, who plays Humbert's lecherous (and oft-disguised) writer friend Clare Quilty. Winters is by turns perky and melancholic as the unwitting Charlotte. You'll fall hard for the daring \\"Lolita.\\"
B000OYC3J8|4.0|Every time the White Stripes put out an album, there is a satisfying sense of the perfect becoming more perfect, though always in a brand-new way. Like the last album, the first few listens offer a few standouts (pretty much all mentioned in previous reviews here) but then, at least for me, the whole thing becomes more interesting as time goes on.     The only sad thing about being a White Stripes fan is the disgusting sexism of critics reviewing their albums. So many people were foaming at the mouth over the Raconteurs--\\"finally, Jack gets to play with boys! Real musicians!\\"--but that album, IMO, fades very quickly. \\"Get a real drummer\\"--um, this would be a completely different band if someone other than Meg played drums. Certainly, her role is more \\"simple\\", but she's totally skilled in the art of doing just enough...you could put some drum geek hero like Neill Pert in her place and the whole sound would be a cacaphony. Her beats are exactly what's called for.    Anyway, this album is great.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Talk about total obsession, I bought this a year ago and held on to it until I saw the play the other nite, I have to say this is a well made movie, Gerard Butler as the Phantom was absolutely the man for the movie, I cant imagine anybody else playing his part, I saw the clips from the original with Sarah and there's no comparison, Gerard was so powerful as an actor, the way he portrayed the part especially when he was trying to seduce Emmy,sooooooooo sexy, anyway, I give this movie a 5 star.
141694737X|5.0|When my first child was a toddler I got this book at the library.  We read it so many times and renewed it several times so I decided to buy it.  My son thought it was so funny and he loved making the animal sounds.  The book has survived two more children who have also loved it.  I buy this book for all baby showers.  I think kids like it because they like animals and lift the flap books. Even my six month old gets excited when I get it out and she's not much of a reader yet.  I think she likes the bold colors and simple drawings.
075640407X|5.0|I've never read a first book so wonderfully written and well thought out as this.  It only took me a few paragraphs into the excerpt on his site and I knew from his writing style that I would love reading the book.  And I was right!  I won't go into spoilers, but I have to say any fantasy fan would just ADORE this.<br /><br />It's an exciting beginning to a trilogy and I can hardly wait for the rest!<br /><br />I heard the author was at Norwescon and can't believe I missed him!
B000MGVCFO|5.0|*The following comments are in regard to the bonus tracks on this release. To read my opinions on the original content of this album, check out my review under:<br />\\"Every Good Boy Deserves Favour\\" by The Moody Blues (Audio CD - 1997) - Original recording remastered<br /><br />Here is what I enjoyed about each of these outstanding bonus offerings...<br /><br />\\"The Story in Your Eyes\\" (Original version):<br />Either this was a slightly slowed-down version of the final version or the final version was speeded up a tad ... Either way, a nice job on the heavy mellotrons on the choruses. The vocals made the song sound like a BBC remake, featuring the original instrumental track. At the end of the track, you can hear a voice that sounds like Denny Laine chanting in falsetto (Ala \\"From The Bottom Of My Heart, I Love You\\" from \\"The Magnificent Moodies\\"), but it's hard to tell who's voice it really is! A really catchy version of this rockin' Justin Hayward classic. :)<br /><br />\\"The Dreamer:\\"<br />This composition, featuring Ray Thomas on vocals, would have fitted nicely on his \\"Hopes, Wishes, And Dreams\\" album, as the music style sounds closer to his solo effort than a Moody Blues song ... Still, it's an impressive haunting and driving tune, and makes for a nice \\"Thomas Trilogy\\" on this release, along with his two \\"E.G.B.D.F.\\" compositions, all unique in sound, but all fantastic in their own way. :)<br /><br />*Something I forgot to add to my original review of this album was that the opening chant of \\"DESOLATION,\\" from \\"Procession,\\" would make for an amusing ring tone for a cell phone, if there isn't already a sound file of this available! Imagine hearing this on somebody's phone while waiting on line at the bank or grocery store?! :)<br /><br />Just like the 1997 CD remaster of \\"Every Good Boy Deserves Favour,\\" this Deluxe Edition also featured a topnotch remastering job! I would recommend this release to any Moody Blues fan or collector. Thanks for reading! God Bless... :)
1594489505|3.0|Comparisons to Kite Runner are going to be inevitable. I felt the Kite Runner was a far more superior novel than A Thousand Splendid Suns. A Thousand Splendid Suns was decent, and I preferred the second half of the book to the first half, which was a bit dull.    The Kite Runner was rich in its prose, characters and storytelling. In comparison A Thousand Splendid Suns had very one-dimensional characters, and Hosseini's writing style comes off as rather bland in some parts of the book.    I'd read Kite Runner over and over again because of some really well written passages. But this one, I believe once would be more than enough.
B000000IUD|5.0|To start off, what a topnotch remastering job on this splendid release! :)<br /><br />Back in the days when I was discovering the music of The Moody Blues (About the 6th grade, in the late 1980's, for me), my parents put together a Moody Blues mix tape from the songs off of the vinyl albums in their collection, for road trips in the car. The cassette included this really cool-sounding rock song with mellotrons and pianos featured in it, and the tune reminded me of \\"Question\\" and \\"Lovely To See You,\\" which I already knew at the time ... Of course, the song turned out to be \\"The Story In Your Eyes,\\" my favorite song on that mix tape, at the time, and I went through all of my parents' records to discover that the song came from \\"Every Good Boy Deserves Favour!\\" Sound-wise, the \\"church-like\\" choir of backing vocals on the choruses are outstanding, and sound similar to the background chanting on \\"Nights In White Satin.\\" The \\"clanging\\" of the pianos, near the end of the track, really packs a punch too, and a nice job on the stereo separation of Justin Hayward's well-sung double-tracked vocals (Best experienced through headphones)!<br /><br />Backing up a bit, I found \\"Procession\\" amusing, and wanted to dissect it piece by piece, by commenting on my favorite pieces ... The Moog synthesizer that opens up the album has such a futuristic quality to it that I don't think you could possibly reproduce such a sound effect for any video game or techno sound recording! Gotta love those \\"bubbling\\" sounds! You don't need an alarm clock when you first hear The Moodies shouting, \\"DESOLATION!\\" The group shout just comes out of nowhere and is one of the most startling moments on a Moody Blues recording (Next to the thunder effects heard on \\"Say What You Mean,\\" from \\"Keys Of The Kingdom\\") ... The band executes their line to perfection, just as the listener is becoming comfortable with the \\"Pillow Of Winds\\" (To quote Pink Floyd from their \\"Meddle\\" album, also released in the same year!) sounds, previously heard ... It's like The Moody Blues summoned the bursts of thunder and rainfall that follow their opening shout! Notice that the \\"E.G.B.D.F.\\" piano chords pan across the stereo field, beginning on the left stereo channel and ending out on the right channel (Another headphone treat!). Originally, I thought that Graeme Edge's electronic drum kit was a set of state-of-the art bongos! They are right on the beat and make for yet another stereophonic delight! The sitar excerpt reminds me of some of George Harrison's work on the late 1960's Beatles albums, mainly \\"Love You To,\\" from \\"Revolver\\" and some of the incidental music on the \\"Help!\\" soundtrack (\\"Another Hard Day's Night\\"/\\"The Chase\\") ... The flute piece reminds me of some of the musical interludes in the \\"Monty Python\\" series ... Strange thought, I know, but it still sounds lovely. :) The harpsichord section makes me think of Colonial times, and the buildup at the end of the track sounds like something that would inspire Queen to create their musical style of \\"God Save The Queen,\\" from \\"A Night At The Opera!\\" Gotta love the \\"Halloweenish\\" organ followed by the double-tracked electric guitar that leads into \\"Story!\\" A fantastic job on this opening piece to the album!<br /><br />The piano in the intro to Ray Thomas' \\"Our Guessing Game\\" really grabbed me, right from the start ... You would have thought that Mike Pinder would begin singing the song, as he did following the piano piece that opened up \\"My Song,\\" later on! Sounded like a symphonic piece to me ... What a marvelous melody! There is great continuity with the stereophonic sound of the double-tracked lead guitar between the solo that ends out \\"Procession\\" and the solo heard on the instrumental break of \\"Guessing Game,\\" as well! The Moodies sound psyched as they all pitch in on the choruses, too. :)<br /><br />Nice job with the xylophone effects on \\"Emily's Song,\\" probably John Lodge's softest, most delicate tune ... The powerful cellos reallybring the rest of the instrumentation together so well. Glad to find that this tune received recognition on the \\"Collected\\" best-of triple disc compilation, as it was not featured in the \\"E.G.B.D.F.\\" portion of \\"Time Traveller.\\" The live version of this song, on the \\"Red Rocks\\" set, is equally enjoyable, by me, I might add. :)<br /><br />Both acoustic and electric guitars dominate Graeme Edge's \\"After You Came,\\" and as any true Moody Blues fan can tell you about this song, it is a successful team effort from all of the vocalists ... John Lodge really sounds like he's getting into singing his parts of the song when he hums briefly during the final chorus on the track! While \\"Time Traveller\\" ignored this outstanding rocker, the song rightfully received recognition on both the \\"Voices In The Sky\\" and \\"The Universal Masters Collection: Classic Moody Blues\\" compilations. :)<br /><br />John's \\"One More Time To Live\\" captures all kinds of moods, and starts off and ends out on a pleasant sounding note ... The intensity on the choruses is well delivered, in both the vocal and instrumental departments ... Sound wise, the choruses make me think of a thunder storm and the soft parts remind me of the calm before and after the storm! Nice job on the way the flutes that ended out this tune blended in with the flutes that open up the next tune, by Ray Thomas...<br /><br />\\"Nice To Be Here\\" sounds like a mellow version of \\"Another Morning,\\" from \\"Days Of Future Passed,\\" and the melody reminds me a little bit of \\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da,\\" by The Beatles, at a couple of points!. :) While Ray indicates that this song takes place during the day (\\"...Lying in the sun\\"), I can't help but feel that the tune has a \\"nighttime\\" feel to it (The mellow instrumentation), in which the animals in the woods get together to perform their tune while all humans are far away, and home, fast asleep. :)<br /><br />Justin's \\"You Can Never Go Home\\" takes me back to \\"Never Comes The Day,\\" from \\"On The Threshold Of A Dream,\\" with the song starting off softly then rocking on the choruses ... On both occasions, Justin superbly showcases both the soft and powerful styles of his vocals. He also delivers a nice soft touch of his electric guitar on the \\"I lie awake for hours\\"/\\"Weep no more for treasures\\" parts of the song. Nice job on the cheerful harmonizing during these same sections of the tune, as well!<br /><br />On Mike Pinder's closing track, \\"My Song,\\" the tune starts off like a classical piece, featuring topnotch piano playing, then we hear Mike singing in his most dramatic style on the \\"Love can change the world\\" section of the song, in similar fashion to his singing style during the fadeout to \\"Melancholy Man,\\" from \\"A Question Of Balance.\\" The harp-like effects and marching drums that take the listener into the instrumental portion of the song blew me away, as did the variety of mellotron sounds that were featured! When the song becomes silent, we can hear the \\"smog\\" effects that were first heard throughout \\"On The Threshold Of A Dream,\\" mainly from \\"In The Beginning.\\" The heavily echoed breathing, in the background, sounded spooky ... Could it have represented the \\"life in other worlds?\\" The breathing did have an otherworldly sound to it! Pretty neat effect on the sound effects that ended out the song, as it was the opening sound effect in \\"Procession,\\" played in reverse! This reminded me of how Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\" began and ended, featuring the same sounds! Thanks to the fadeout on Mike's track, we do get the impression that this is indeed \\"a song that never ends!\\" In addition, isn't it amusing that the very first song on the following album, \\"Seventh Sojourn,\\" was written and sung by Mike? Imagine how \\"My Song\\" would have sounded if it morphed into \\"Lost In A Lost World,\\" in the space between the fadeout of the former song and the fade-in of the latter song! This concept would have been further proof in carrying out \\"a song that never ends\\" ... Just an impression I had between the two Pinder tunes. :)<br /><br />For me, this is a good album to listen to late in the evening, right before going to sleep ... It must also have something to do with the nighttime setting on the album cover, but much of the instrumentation creates a \\"dreamy\\" atmosphere on this recording, most notably the mellotrons, so it's a nice album to relax to. \\"Boy,\\" I'm in \\"Favour\\" of \\"Every Good\\" (Or should I say \\"Great!\\") Moody Blues song on this \\"Deserving\\" of praise album!

B0000636NQ|5.0|Originally hit the streets in 1968, as this was Ten Years After's second album. It just doesn't get much better than this. Simply great, timeless as well as essential British blues rock. Tracks here that brought back some memories of days long gone were the foot-stomper \\"Rock Your Mama\\", \\"Spoonful\\", \\"Woodpecker's Ball\\", \\"I Can't Keep From Crying\\" and the tune that truly made Alvin Lee and company a household name, \\"I'm Going Home\\" (who could forget their legendary performance of this gem in the Woodstock film?). Saw that the four cuts that were initially left off the lp because there wasn't room has been now added as bonus tracks. Like I said, it DOESN'T get much better.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Beautifully brought to life, not only the love and beauty of her characters, but of her life as well.  Renee Zellweger is American, but she speaks the British accent so brilliantly as she did in Bridget Jones' Diary. It gave me the pleasure of focusing on her acting and how beautifully she does it too.  So well written that I found myself there.  This movie is being added to my library of everything English!!
B00003CXA2|5.0|Forrest Gump is a greatlook at the 60s and 70s. Tom Hanks is the most likable actor from his generation. Forrest Gump may seem dumb but he mostly makes sense. Forrest Gump has a good heart and guts, his life is a good full life. Forrest Gump is one of the best characters in movie history. This movie is everything its supposed to be.
B0002WS3S2|4.0|When I first heard YOU, I thought it was the most odd and brilliant record I'd ever heard.  It is the final act of a hippie-esque \\"smoke opera\\" that takes the now-venerable jam-band flights of trippy fantasy to new and dizzy heights.  More akin to Ozric Tentacles than to the Grateful Dead, the tunes on this disc are challenging, mesemerising, and ultimately quite satisfying.<br /><br />Steer clear if you're attached to traditional song dynamics, 2:45 bits of pop structure, or made nervous by music that carries you away.<br /><br />Not a perfect album, but well worth the time and attention of the adventurous listener.
B000OCZ80Q|5.0|If your into your new hd dvd player and looking for new ways to expand your horizions!!  This could be it..i'm not a huge fan of ballet myself, but with Tchaikovsky playing and a crystal clear picture hd dvd can even make ballet very enjoyable..so if your up for something new or already a big fan of ballet and Tchaikovsky. i say this is a must buy!! plus you don't have to get all dressed up and spend $200 to see
B000QFAJ7S|3.0|I'm a singer myself so I like to hear the actual talent of the singer more than the \\"noise\\" that overshadows it.<br /><br />There are a few songs on this cd that I enjoy listening to but overall, I was rather disappointed.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Now that I've had a chance to listen to this cd a couple hundred times, it's becomming one of my favorites!  I really can't wait for Kelly to record the country album she has planned for next year!!
B000QFCD2W|4.0|I could never resist a trashy trailer park chick or an A&W cheeseburger, but most importantly, I could never resist a new King Diamond album.  Roughly four years in the waiting he spits out a new one.  After a few days of constant spins in my car I've decided that I like this one...alot.  Like a good number of King Diamond albums, this may not catch you on the first listen.  I know that little jumped out and grabbed me on that first(or even second)listen.  But under further listening as I got more familiar with the songs, I found this really grew on me.  Some might love it straight off the bat, and there's nothing wrong with that.  But if you find yourself a tad on the disappointed side the first time around, don't be discouraged.  After all, Abigail 2 was kinda the same way(and I understand that depending on who you are, that isn't necessarily a good thing).  In fact, in terms of this album's sound, this sorta feels like it should have been the one that came out between Abigail 2 and Puppet Master.  King's not breaking any new ground here, so if you can't stand the guy in the first place or if you haven't liked anything since Them, you're probably not gonna be swayed.  King has stated in a few interviews that he feels this is his best work to date.  That's a rather bold statement considering how many classic albums the guy has....in two bands no less.  Clever marketing scheme or just very confident?  You'll have to decide that.  Although I don't feel it's his best work, it's damn good and obvious that he worked hard on it.  Word on the street is that King saw a painting that influenced the album's story.  The painting naturally became the album's cover.  It's obvious King loves this painting since it appears on every page of the booklet.  While musically, King is in shipshape, his story this time around isn't one of his best.  It's not bad by any means, and it certainly has some effective moments(I dare you not to laugh when he goes, \\"Ow! Ow! Something hit me on the head!\\"), but he's using bits and pieces from previous stories.  He seems to love his haunted houses on hills occupied by ghostly figures.  The album's title might sound a little silly, but in the context of the story(it's a line spoken by a ghost of a little girl) it makes sense.  I'm really glad this came out, and I'm really glad I like it as much as I do.  And I'm very glad King is still going without signs of slowing down.  So, if you like King, do both the devil and yourself a favor and give this a spin...two or three at least.e head!\\"), but he's using bits and pieces from previous stories.

B000000XB9|4.0|An excellent greatist hits CD, I used a handful of songs to burn a CD with other related style of music.
B0000042MY|5.0|I listen to this soundtrack everytime I ride through the Appalachian Mountains and when I drive to Chimney Rock, (Why not listen to the soundtrack of the \\"..Mohican's\\" filmed location? -It really sets the mood.)  The whole mood of the music fits in with the cinematography and timescape of the film. So many feelings are poured into the making of each composition, and mostly through tracks like \\"The Glade\\", \\"The Kiss\\", \\"The Courier\\", \\"Elk Hunt\\" and of course \\"Promentory\\", you'll feel passion, anxiety, intune with nature, and every possible feeling that deals with love and determination. I wish \\"Promentory\\" would have been as precise as the version on the film. I miss the bass strings and the part where Uncas dies and Alice chooses her fate. There's a steady tune of violin and symphonic bits that add to the on-coming climax. But all in all, I still enjoy listening to this album, and will for many years to come. And Clannad a remarkable impression on the film. On the VHS, you'll here a beautiful, dreary female voice sing the song \\"I will find you\\". To bad it is edited out of the U.S. DVD release.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|I guess I shouldn't be surprised that a show this smart and original cannot survive in a society that considers so-called reality television entertainment.  That said, I'm greatly saddened by its passing.    Though season three is not as good as the previous two seasons, it is still hands down the best show on television--and well worth the purchase.    Watch all three seasons of Veronica Mars--you will not be disappointed!
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|I just have to say my first listen of this CD, I wasn't impressed and even a little disappointed.  \\"Breakaway\\" was awesome and definately hard to top.  However, the more I play this CD, the more it grows on me.  This album is definately worth purchasing but don't be surprised if at first listen you aren't satisfied.  Just give it a chance and before you know it you'll be singing right along.  It's different than anything she has done before so at least give it an honest listen a couple of times before passing judgment.  You might find like I did that your mind has changed!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Seriously, this is the scariest movie you'll ever see.  What is so scary?  What we are doing to our earth and what our future holds is scary.  THis is not a political movie.  This is a movie to present the facts of global warming in an easy way.  It also answers all the questions people ask when they do not believe in global warming or when they want to try to disprove it.  Gore has heard it all and he very carefully lays out all of the proof and disproves the myths.  A must see.  After I saw it in the theater I called every friend and told them to see it then I bought the DVD so I can show it to more friends.
B000MIVCX4|4.0|I purchased this GPS before making a road trip around the country.  I used it with Microsoft Streets and Trips, and I never got lost.  Great response time and refresh rates.  Picks up satellites quickly.  Easy to install, worked great in conjunction with Streets and Trips.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|I have been a fan of Michael Bubl&eacute; since his self-titled debut album.  With each CD Michael makes, I find myself falling more in love with his voice, and this cd is no exception.  My favorite song is on the album is \\"Everything.\\"  I was so happy to hear the song on the Top 40 radio stations, and was extremely happy when I caught the video on Vh1.  You know you are one cool cat when you have Whoopi Goldberg and Bono from U2 making cameos in a music video.  Michael makes \\"the big band sound\\" cool.
B000N6TX22|5.0|Children of Men stands out as one of the better movies recently released on HD DVD for two reasons: the film itself tells an engaging story and the HD presentation is one of the best so far released.    Firstly, the story. The film starts out with a bang and uses this to keep the viewer on the edge of their seat as the story unfolds. Children of Men tells a dark tale of a future which has a dead end due to the sudden infertility of the human race and the subsequent xenophobia on a large scale. It is one of the most emotionally engaging dramas that I have seen in a very long time.    Then there is the HD presentation. This is without a doubt, one of the best HD transfers that I have seen to date. The cinematography, palette and sound all contribute to this experience. If you are just getting into HD this should be high on your first purchase list.
075640407X|5.0|This book grabbed my attention right from the start and never let go. Riveting, sly, beautifully written - I can't wait for the next Day!
0385340559|3.0|I found myself snoozing after the strong opening. Especially disappointing<br />was the total lack of character development in the villains, which Child<br />often does so well. Also, the relative void of action. Except for the terrific fire scene, the action was either dull or contrived, such as the<br />final scene. And Neagley is not anywhere near the well drawn character<br />she is in Without Fail, a similar book in emphasizing the \\"ensemble\\"<br />aspect, but,in my opinion, far superior, more suspenseful and interesting.<br />(The death of Froelich is stunning.) There was no real sense of menace,<br />no creepiness. And,I agree with another reviewer, please bag the math...bring back the \\"waited a beat\\" motif, if you must employ a tic.<br />But the description and mood of LA was outstanding and he wrote up a<br />deadly accurate Las Vegas. Reminded me a bit of One Shot,in pace and structure, but wasn't quite as good. Nevertheless, Child is a superb writer, quite extraordinary.
B000P2A256|2.0|Maroon 5 has gone soft.  There is no \\"meat\\" to this album.  Songs About Jane was so strong, and therefore as a follow-up this album is quite disappointing.
0156711427|5.0|The love-hate relationships weave throughout this book to an extent unlike any other that I have ever read.<br /><br />Major characters and young lovers, Adela Quested and Ronny Heaslop, love and hate and love and finally part from one another.  Their engagement sizzles out in the heat of the Indian summer.  Other major characters, Dr. Aziz and Professor Fielding, are great friends, to the point where Fielding severs relations with his separatist British friends in honor of his wrongly arrested Indian friend. But, through strange facts and circumstances, Aziz begins to hate, then detest and ultimately love him again.<br /><br />Perhaps the greatest love, with no hate, is Mrs. Moore.  She loves Indians - not just India. Indians respond with a loving chant of her name - Esmiss Esmoor.  She rises to the divine. But, alas even she must demure to the almighty British imperialistic state - this is a 1924  novel when India and Britain were in a love-hate relationship of their own.<br /><br />This novel is Forster's great rebound. Thought to be a severely suffering writer-blocked novelist, he could reach no more for Italy to spur him to the typewriter (\\"A Room with a View\\" and \\"Where Angels Fear to Tread\\").  Unlike \\"Room\\" or \\"Angels\\", he does not deliver an ethical question to the reader as handled by British aristocracy.  The moral or ethical question here is directed to all Brits -- rich or poor, new to India or born to India -- and asks if what they do to others is devastingly harmful, let alone inappropriate.<br /><br />Divided in the three parts, the book sets you up [Part I: Mosque], slams the British [Part II: Caves] and sums it up [Part III: Temple].  To his credit, Forster's delivery of this book may have been as recklessly brave  as Fielding's protection of Dr. Aziz - the British with whom each associates would not kindly take to each's allegiance to the \\"other\\" side.<br /><br />Much akin to America's great \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\", this novel deals with the classic trial of a great citizen of the oppressed who allegedly acted wrongly to one of the young white women. Unlike \\"Mockingbird\\", this book concentrates more on the victim of the allegations and allows him to receive true justice - the white woman in this trial has a great deal more character and saves his day.<br /><br />I can only wonder how this book affected Britain.  Like Upton Sinclair's \\"The Jungle\\", people were probably enlightened by this book's revelations. British people would have had to discuss the atrocities contained within the pages of this novel and social change would inevitably follow. Written strongly with great drama, this book unfortunately remains applicable to today's world and probably still would be discussed if delivered to themainstream reading masses.ssed who allegedly acted wrongly to one of the young white women.

B000QFAJ7S|5.0|I hate American Idol and the music it produces.  Why?  Because the singers who provide the talent get told what to do and what to sing, and the music just sounds fabricated and soulless.  That was the problem that plagued Clarkson's first album, Thankful.  Sure, the voice was amazing, but the album was just generic.  Breakaway, well, broke away from that image, showing us the potential that Clarkson had in rock music.  Still formed around a pop influence, it did manage to propel her into music stardom as she became her own artist.    My December is that natural progression of Breakaway, but this time, the pop sound is almost completely absent.  Does it work for Kelly Clarkson?  ABSOLUTELY!  For the first time, we hear a true artist with her own identity showing her HER album...not Clive Davis' or Max Martin's.  This is rock music, not American Idol.  This is the reason why Kelly Clarkson chose to pursue this career.    \\"Never Again\\" is a perfect example of what this album sounds like.  From here the album goes into an extravaganza of anger, introspection and longing.  Songs like \\"Sober\\", \\"Hole\\", \\"Judas\\" and \\"Irvine\\" show true emotion...something her previous albums lacked.  As a second single, \\"Sober\\" will undoubtedly show the world a side of Clarkson we've never seen.  I'm not sure what the plans are for future singles, but there are several potentials (the afore-mentioned \\"Judas\\", or maybe \\"One Minute\\").    Her record label seems to be trying especially hard to bury this album.  If you believe that hype, then shame on you.  Just because Clive Davis doesn't like the album doesn't mean you won't.  Just because radio doesn't like her choice of singles doesn't mean they're bad.  It's true, the album doesn't quite fit the mold of what Top 40 radio will play, but in my opinion that's a good thing!  Most of the album will sound perfect on the modern rock stations.    If you want to hear fabricated bubble-gum rock-pop, then obviously this album is not for you.  If you want to hear a truly talented artist bearing her soul over well-written and emotional rock, then buy this record.  You won't be disappointed.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|It arrived today.    It's in my CD player now.    Simply put, Thankful, Kelly's first album was mostly Clive Davis. Breakaway we get to hear more of Kelly and more rock oriented and the direction she wanted to go. My December personal look into the person and her being brave enough to power herself out in these songs... it's not an easy thing to put yourself out there basically naked for the world. But that's what she has done and she stands behind it and I will say BRAVO Kelly!     I'm glad to see the growth over the three albums. She has been one of he only AI's that reaches and stretches to \\"make real music\\" and not rehash was was there before or be packaged into a pop princess. For longevity in the music world, Kelly needed to make this album just like she needed to make the other two... progression, discovery. To show she has not just vocal chops... but she IS the whole REAL package.     Love the new album.... I also love Pink and Evanescence and what I'm saying there is they rock, they go deep with their lyrics and if you like either of them, you probably will like this album. It's rockin with a true twist of Kelly.
B000929AJQ|5.0|I waited a long time to write this review for a reason.  I wanted to see, because there are so many haters of this album out there, how it stood up to The Fragile, the album prior to it's release, and Year Zero, the album which came out afterwards.  It is comparable to both, with The Fragile and Year Zero being my favorite NIN albums of all.  I see all these people writing and saying how terrible this album is, that Trent just put something out to sell records because he hadn't put an album out in a long time.  That's bush!!  The music on this album is awesome.  It's as textured at times as The Downward Spiral or The Fragile, or even Year Zero, and at other times as heavy as Broken.  Plus the live drumming that Dave Grohl provides on most of the tracks is excellent.  And the lyrics are pretty good if you listen to them.  Sure, Trent deals with coping with love, anger ,being lonely, and heartache.  This is obvious on tracks \\"All the Love in the World, \\"Love is not Enough\\", \\"Only\\", and \\"Sunspots\\".  He also is leading to the political precursor of Year Zero with tracks like \\"The Hand that Feeds\\", and \\"Right Where it Belongs\\".  This is just a message to all of the haters out there that Trent was writing about the things he knew about and the things that were important to him.  And if anyone thinks that the music itself is bad, have your hearing tested.  Keep up the great work Trent.
B000J103PC|4.0|Although it been quite awhile since I have read this book, I really think that they have done a fantastic job of adapting it to film. It doesn't exactly follow the story line, but then who really cares? Why would you want to watch a film that is EXACTLY like the book? That's boring, anyway.<br /><br />The Devil Wears Prada movie left me asking for more. I left feeling that I wanted to know more about what Andy Sachs had in store for herself. Nonetheless, she did do quite a bit of growing the year she worked for Meranda Priestly at Runway. Her transformation was stunning.<br /><br />This movie was great! It showed stylish characters, and fabulous New York and Paris Scenes.<br /><br />Meryl Streep also did a marvelous job at playing Miranda Priestly. I bet is was difficult to keep a straight face all the time. In fact, a little birdy told me that she didn't even talk to Anne Hathaway off-set so that she would be able to stay in character.<br /><br />This is an entertaining, classy, chic', coming-of-age movie.

As with four of the other five, it follows the same formula of a financially disadvantaged young woman who meets and marries a wealthier man. The exception is her novel \\"Emma\\" where the protagonist has her owns means. There are no axe murders in an Austen novel or any nasty elements. Her stories take place in small English towns and they all have a variety of characters including a few willful women and usually one male rogue.<br /><br />As background information, I have read all of Austen's novels, and I have read various analyses of Austen's work.<br /><br />\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is Jane Austen's finest novel. That book is the perfect balance of story, prose, structure, and interesting characters. It evokes many emotional responses in the reader. That novel is among the greatest novels of all time on par with for example Flaubert's \\"Madame Bovary\\" or Tolstoy's \\"Anna Karenina.\\" From a strictly literary point of view, \\"Mansfield Park\\" is the most complicated and sophisticated literary work penned by Austen.<br /><br />So, where does that leave \\"Persuasion\\" among her novels? The present novel is good and it is generally thought of as one of her five best. It is one of her mature novels - as opposed to Northanger Abbey, an early work. It has a good story and good characters. I liked her treatment of Captain Wentworth. The description and the story about the primary character, Anne Elliot, is vintage Austen writing and story telling. But overall it does not quite reach the heights of those other two great Austen novels. Still, I rate it somewhere between 4 and 5 stars. It is more a question of whether you like the story or not, since it follows the Austen formula. All of her five mature novels share a certain fixed writing style and a common structure, or the Austen formula as mentioned above. She uses the early pages to introduce the families, and other characters, and give start the story. She moves characters around from place to place in part for time shifting. She does a wrap up in the last few chapters.<br /><br />Those opening chapters are an obstacle for most readers. She uses her own vocabulary and has an unusual way of structuring her prose. That structure is a trademark of Austen's writing. Also, she manages to work in a lot of drama and social issues with some humor and irony.<br /><br />Austen wrote the novel based on contemporay life in England from approximately 1814 to 1815, in the post Napolean period, and it was published in 1816 after her other works. Overall I would rate it as excellent but not her best. It is similar to \\"Sense and Sensibility\\"and much better than her early novel \\"Northanger Abbey\\" in terms of literary sophistication and the characters, and it ranks behind the two novels mentioned above and \\"Emma.\\" Those three (Emma, Pride and Prejudice, and Mansfield Park) are her finest works.<br /><br />Most Austen fans will love the book, and I would recommend the novel.to place in part for time shifting.

B000QFAJ7S|4.0|First off, I have to offer up that I am a professional bassist (studio and live) with well over ten years of experience in jazz/rock/pop, etc...  I am also a huge Kelly Clarkson fan.  I think she has incredible vocal chops and talent beyond her years.  I also thought her first two records were really well done on their own terms... very different from one another, but they did a great job of showcasing her considerable talents as a pop/r&b singer, then as a harder rock/pop singer.  I was excited to hear that during the production of this record, she decided to go in a more rock-heavy direction.  I won't review every song, as I think there have been enough comments posted thus far for folks to chew on themselves.  My main points of contention with this record are the same ones I have with a lot of records produced these days, and that is that it is WAY too compressed and in-your-face to enjoy continuously.  It's a scientific fact that our ears fatigue after a certain time listening to sounds at a given dynamic level.  This record is so compressed and flat in terms of dynamics that it is hard to listen to repeatedly!  I realize that most major label releases are trying to compete for radio play, and that being the loudest possible song in the mix will make it stick out more.  It is/has gotten out of hand though.    The next gripe... the flatness of the mixes.  I had to seriously alter the EQ settings in my car in order to fully hear everything because this record is so treble-heavy and squashed.  There is no air around Kelly's voice or any of the other instruments in the mix.  Even \\"Breakaway\\", which was heavily produced, sounded more open and a bit more organic than this record in many cases.  At times the digital distortion is very audible and the compression is so heavy-handed that you can hear the attack and decay over the ENTIRE track, not just on one particular instrument.  I was very surprised to see that Andy Wallace mastered this record... go back and listento Jeff Buckley's \\"Grace\\" from 1994 to hear a properly mixed/mastered album that Andy Wallace worked on.  For that matter, listen to that record and hear how much more the mixes breathe.  If this record had been mastered in the same fashion, we'd have a seriously great record on our hands.    In conclusion, kudos to Kelly for a continued heartfelt direction in songwriting and choice of material.  Shame on the producers and the execs who let such a great artistic effort get squashed by horrendous production/mastering.
0688156819|3.0|Frankly, I didn't find this book to be very creative or interesting. Many of the vignettes are much too short to evoke any humor or feelings. The author seems to have glanced at his surroundings and made a boy or girl character out of things ranging from stains to matches and then proceeded to make up obvious stories about them. (Surprise, surprise, the match girl was \\"hot\\" and burned up her stick lover.) The three stars is for the illustrations and the melancholy concept.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|Like many others here, I listened to the other albums until they wore out. Minutes to Midnight I listened to about 5 times and haven't since. Yes it has more mellow tracks, but I don't even think that's the main problem. Most of the songs are just plain annoying. Something went bad with the song writing somewhere. Maybe they spent too long on it, maybe the magic just didn't happen in the studio - which happens to even the best bands. One song sounds like a poor man's version of With or Without You -- there is a definite U2 influence gone wrong on several tunes.    The thing about LP that I think drew the most people to them is the emotional connection with the lyrics -- they always seemed like they were singing about exactly what you were feeling. That's not happening here for me, other than the opening track Given Up which still has the old angry Chester. But after that, it's off a cliff. There are cool sounds and beats here and there, but not those lyrics and melodies that really make you feel like you're not alone.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|I absolutely love this album.  Kelly broke out of her shell and defintaly away from the other American Idol singers.  I believe Kelly is trying to find her own voice and that is why she writes her own lyrics (and we know many artists that do not do that).  I do not know to much about the Clive situation, but I think she did very well without him.  This album has a little more edge and beat.  I'm not saying go out and buy this album now, but give it a chance....give Kelly a chance.  Hopefully her next album, she will have a few songs that are with another singer.  My December is defintaly a \\"summer\\" album and I know Kelly will be even better the next album.  I am now listening to her album and rocking out!
0312426984|2.0|I will not give a synopsis of the book because it has already been provided.  However, I will caution, do not read this book if you are a reader who likes a heavy plotline.  There is minimal plot in this book. One would therefore expect more character development.  But, alas, there is minimal character development as well.  Characters start off selfish and superficial, and remain so throughout the book.  I wish I could say that the writing was good, but I felt it was bloated and repetitive.  Phrase embedded within phrase simply slowed the pace of the already-slow story for me.  Somewhere in this book, however, was the promise of a good story.(hence the two stars.)  Tighter writing, a heavy editing hand, and perhaps more likable characters would have brought out the essential story question...how can a romance between an older woman bookseller and a younger college guy survive?  (WARNING: SPOILER) Unfortunately, however, the ending is not resolved and the author drops the ball.
B00005JPQT|4.0|John McClane was out pretty late  Watching Daughter Lucy on her date    The guy's feeling frisky wants to give her a go  But good girl Lucy is saying, no, no, no    He says, \\"Leave her alone, `cause I'm John McClane\\"  She says, \\"Leave me alone, John, cause that's no longer my name.\\"     Then things go from worse to dread  Just as Dear John is heading for bed    He gets a call he should have been a slacker  The Feddies want him to pick up a hacker    You see, hackers have broken in to the FBI  And they need someone to tell them why    All he's got to do is pick up a Jersey kid and take him to DC  --well for John, how hard could that be?     It was a simple job in the middle of the night  But, of course, the bad guys wouldn't let that work right    They want the kid dead and they're not stopping at one  If they've got to, they're gonna kill John    First, it's guns through the windows--and I'm not talking the OS  Then, the kid's computer explodes making his apartment a mess    But, next the beginning starts seeming real slow  All the DC traffic lights have switched to GO    All systems are starting to fail  The kid Matt says someone wants a Fire Sale    What is that, the Feddies must know  The government, the money market, the utilities all blow    But who'd do this dastardy deed?  A former employee, who's thoroughly teed!     Gabriel told the Feds their system was flawed  And hacked into the Joint Chiefs thinking they'd applaud    Instead of giving his genius the floor---  They kicked poor Gabriel out the door    So to save this country he claims he loves  Gabriel's staging a fire sale without the kid gloves    Now it's up to John and the hacker Matt  To see that Gabriel's plans fall flat    They're faced with every kind of foe  When Death calls them, neither man will go    When the bullets in his gun wouldn't last that far  John killed a helo with his car    At last, they've taken Dear Lucy and that makes John mad  Not the best idea to p-off dear Dad    But the girl's no slouch and she proves her worth  Makes those bad guys regret their birth    Then after John delivers his trademark line  Matt the Geek tells John that Lucy looks mighty fine    Now please excuse my humble verse  The movie wasn't the best, but it could have been worse!
0753820250|2.0|I really can't see the charm that this book holds for so many. It started fine but could not hold my interest. I didn't think the writing was exceptional though many reviewers here felt the opposite. I thought his attempt to constantly be setting a \\"spooky\\" mood failed for me and his descriptions in this effort were often trite. I also felt the translation in some of the writing. I found it hard to really love the characters and the main character was inconsistent in how he was portrayed. Just a disappointment.
0805047905|4.0|My children have both enjoyed this book and my three-year-old son can tell the story from memory.  Great rythym, beautiful illustrations... but once you get to the end it seems like a let down.  I can't really explain it, but the rest of the book is so cute and engaging that the students/teacher part seems out of place.<br /><br />I'd label this a \\"favorite\\" rather than a \\"classic.\\"  For classics, I look to wonderful works such as Wynken, Blynken & Nod, Aesop's Fables or a Child's Garden of Verses.<br /><br />Recommended.
B000Q6GUTI|4.0|This was a good movie from start to finish. It was never a dull moment, Anyone looking to watch a action packed, cat/mouse game, this is for you. If you like, \\"The Fugitive and Jason Bourne Movies\\" then this is right up your alley. On the down side the fact that every kill was a head shot is very far fetched. A moving target at those distances is not going to be a head shot, to small of a target. It adds to the movie but having first hand knowledge as a USMC scout sniper from Camp Lejeune(8541 MOS)it would never be a head shot, chest shot would be the target.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|The cutting edge heavy hybrid rock sound that uniquely defined Linkin Park only exists in a few songs such as \\"What I've Done\\" and \\"No More Sorrow\\". Most of the other songs are a re-hash of a more familiar rock style that is neither original nor cutting edge. The pace of the songs is slower, monotonous and disconnected compared to their previous albums.    No matter what your political slant is the political preaching in this album's songs is disappointing, boring and unoriginal. Those types of songs should be left to Green Day, The Dixie Chicks and aging hippie folk music groups.     I agree with many of the disappointed fans who felt that LP has essentially tried to re-invent itself with \\"Minutes to Midnight\\" by embracing more common musical themes, styles and lyrics. I found that the more I listened to this album the less I liked it which is contrary to what I felt about their previous albums.
0345350499|3.0|I've read (though not finished) this book three times and had vastly different ideas each time.  The first time, as a 13-year old, I cared nothing about accuracy or sense.  I trusted the protagonist implicitly, until she left Avalon, at which point, I threw the book across the room, not wanting to ever see it again.  I tried a second time (at age 14), loved it, stayed up nights reading it, and was overwhelmed.  I treated it solely as fantasy, not caring about how accurate it was to Arthurian story-telling conventions.  I wanted to read it again, at age 16 or 17, and couldn't get through it.  The many flaws of the protagonists which I had not noticed before were too glaringly obvious.      So, why give this little list of personal experiences?  It seems to be that this book depends entirely on how the reader perceives it.  It is insulting to the historical(?) or at least, popularly known mythological, characters of Guinevere, Merlin, Arthur, Lancelot, and many others.  It is inaccurate, both in its depictions of Druids (which are turned into something very New-Age-y), people of the time, and pretty much everything else.  There is a reason that this book is fantasy, and the very few magical elements are not the whole of this reason.      Marion Zimmer Bradley, I have to admit, is an amazing writer.  Her \\"Morgaine speaks\\" segments, written in the first person, are beautiful and the prose in general is just gorgeous.  Yet, this book is 876 or so pages, and just good writing cannot carry it. The plot dies somewhere in the beginning-of-the-middle and isn't really reborn until the middle-of-the-end.  The characters are flawed, and not always by design.  Many of the secondary character (and all the tertiary ones) are two-dimensional, and portrayed as the very worst of the stereotypes surrounding them.  Is there even one Christian priest in this book who is not shown as stupid, petty, fanatical, and a howling bigot?  Not that I've  seen...    If a reader is ready to embracethe religious and political messages of this book, it can be inspirational, moving, and life-altering.  Yet, a reader used to dissecting books looking for themes and the like will get either overwhelmed in minutiae or bored.  Someone looking only for a good plot would be advised to stop at the end of the first part, and skip ahead to page 600 or so... nothing too important happens in between.      I would give this book a try. But if you are not grabbed by the end of page 70, put it down.  There is no reason to torture yourself with 800 more pages.
B00005JKGK|5.0|This is a great story to share with you daughter.  I have 2 daughters and will show them this DVD.  I watched it with my mother and we cried.  The women in this story are so real and every woman can relate to at least one of them.  A must see--DVD, a must read book.
0753820250|3.0|Having finished this book, I stopped and stared at the last page, wondering if this was it, or if I missed something.<br /><br />Unlike many of the more positive reviewers here, I did not lose any sleep reading or anything like that.  I read this one a few chapters at a time, during lunch breaks or when I had nothing better to do.  Therefore, perhaps there are others who do not feel that most of the secondary characters are forgettable at best, and mostly, forgotten.  there are many secondary subplots, most of them melodramatic and some, either insipid or maudlin, and all of them relate to the main mystery of just who was Julian Carax, the author for whom the main character, Daniel, searches.  Yet, reading this book, I often asked myself if the details of the sub-sub-sub-plots were really necessary.  I spent much of the novel confused about who was who, and only at the end was I able to differentiate between the named of the main villain and Daniel's mysterious friend, Fermin.  In fact, it was he who I wished to know about.<br /><br />There is a plethora of subplots, and numerous lengthy descriptions of Barcelona, with which I am not familiar enough to really appreciate any of them.  At a few points, the plot stops so that we can learn more about some of the characters, and then is slow to continue.  Still, the book holds much promise, especially at the beginning, with the numerous mysteries and a few enchanting places (like the cemetary) and people.  Yet, at the end, the author obviously forgot the \\"show, don't tell\\" rule, and lays out the whole mystery, and the solution for it, in an extraordinarily long and impossibly detailed letter, written by a secondary character to Daniel.  THis letter, while ostensibly written in some haste on the last day of her life, dwells into minute descriptions.  The tone of it is indistinguishable from the rest of the story.  It is here that, for me, one of the main problems lies.  None of the characters have their own tone.  The second half of the book is just a collection of memories, and I never could remember just whose memory it was, they all sounded so similar.<br /><br />So, on the whole, the book has an engaging, if somewhat clicheed plotline, some good imagery and a few interesting characters and mysteries.  Yet, the prose is often over-wrought, the minor characters are described too much while still remaining two-dimensional, and real suspense is lacking.  I would recommend getting this book from a library, and then deciding.  It really is not bad, but it fails to captivate the reader.book is just a collection of memories, and I never could remember just whose memory it was, they all sounded so similar.

B000OMD4BG|5.0|I love this collection. It's like two lost albums were found. Some of his most beautiful and haunting material. The world lost a brilliant songwriter when Elliott passed away. His death is as important to me as John Lennon's (if you knew me, you'd know that that means alot in my world); they both could have gone on to contribute so much more to the world. Maybe they're somewhere playing together right now. That would be cool.
B000BTGY1O|1.0|i have wanted to see this movie for years because i had always heard such wonderful things about it.  what a bust.  holly golightly is just too flakey to be able to follow in this movie.  totally unrealistic plot.  and really it was going no where. don't bother with this movie.  it was a real disappointment.
B000065BPB|4.0|These are excellent headphones for all usage scenarios, except perhaps travel. The large full headphones they collapse quite neatly, however they are still rather bulky in collapsed mode to travel with. Otherwise the sound quality, comfort and tone ranges that these headphones can achieve are outstanding.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|The acting is inspired; the story is amazing. Set in beautiful Wyoming, this film captures what love really means. A friend and I watched this late at night and had to go to a 24-hour diner to \\"recover.\\" It's not a movie I can watch over and over again -- it's just so heart wrenching -- but I own it. I own it because it's so real, the same reason I own Gibson's \\"We Were Soldiers.\\" It makes me cry a lot, but it's an \\"OmigodWOW-thatsreallybeautifulandsad\\" kind of crying. Everyone should watch this movie. And if it makes you uncomfortable, maybe you should look deep inside and ask yourself why.
B00005JPQT|5.0|It is worth noting that before \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" was released, it actually had two complaints that it had to deal with: not only was it PG-13, the grandfather of the \\"Die Hard\\" series, John McTiernan (who directed \\"Die Hard\\" and \\"Die Hard With a Vengeance\\"; something that gave McTiernan the honor of directing all but one of the DH films before this was released), was MIA. Negative signs for a sequel, especially a sequel to a film that came out twelve years ago (\\"Die Hard With a Vengeance\\") and is a fourth film in a trilogy.    But, none of the above hurts \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" whatsoever. This time around, John McClane (Bruce Willis) is still a New York City police officer. While John McClane's police work has become easier, his personal life hasn't. This is due to the fact that John McClane is divorced from his wife Holly, and that his two children, Lucy (portrayed by Mary Elizabeth Winstead in this film) and John Jr. are not speaking to him (throughout this film, with the exception of a picture of the actress that played Holly McClane in \\"Die Hard\\" and \\"Die Hard 2: Die Harder\\", Bonnie Bedelia, being present, there is no sign of either Holly McClane or John McClane Jr. throughout this film).    And then, one night, everything in John McClane's life turns around and makes a turn for the worse. Once John McClane has arrested a computer hacker by the name of Matt Farrell (Justin Long), before McClane knows it, he and Farrell are on the run. Now, not only is it up to John McClane to save the life of Matt Farrell(and before he knows it, his own daughter),he and Farell,before they know it, are up against Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olymphant),a dangerous man who has the computer infrastructure and the world at the tip of his fingers.    Can John McClane not only defeat Thomas Gabriel, but at the same time, rescue his own daughter, Matt Farrell, and the entire nation? Or, will the power of Thomas Gabriel lead to Gabriel defeating both John McClane and the nation, andMcClane's personal life and career being permanently scarred?    The only things that will tell are time, decisions, and intelligence.    So, what makes \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" a strong addition to the \\"Die Hard\\" series? Based off of the article \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" by John Carlin,\\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" understands its limits. It avoids becoming too much of reality that several people fear every day, without trying to be light for that specific reason. In that matter, \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" is straightforward and realistic, something that any type of film like itself needs. There is plenty of suspense and action in \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" that is richly executed, and is able to remain true to its predecessors (\\"Die Hard\\",\\" Die Hard 2:Die Harder\\", and \\"Die Hard With a Vengeance\\"),without recycling them. At the same time, you will find classic humor that is to be found in \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\". This humor 1)never fails to entertain,2)fits in well the script, and 3)is suitable enough for \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" to be a strong addition to the \\"Die Hard\\" films, without going overboard.    The acting in \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" is also another one of the film's highlights. The main actors of \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\"--Bruce Willis,Justin Long,Timothy Olymphant,and actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead--plus several others--perfectly understand the drama and emotion that their performance in \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" requires, and execute it to their fullest. At the same time, Bruce Willis and Justin Long make a perfect onscreen team, while Willis, despite his age, NAILS the action that his fourth portrayal of John McClane requires.    It is also worth noting that even though some people were angry/disappointed that John McTiernan did not direct \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\", the director of LFODH, Len Wiseman (who was hired as a replacement director for McTiernan, as a result of McTiernan having \\"Three Kings\\" and \\"Batman Begins\\" producer Charles Roven wiretapped and lying to FBI agents about it) serves as a perfect director for the film. Not only does Len Wiseman's direction of \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" save the film from its PG-13 rating (in other words, Wiseman did a good job at making sure that LFORDH was not less intense by its rating, something that could have happened) and give it the suspense, emotion, action, and humor that it needed, there is something else worth noting. That is the fact that as good as the first three \\"Die Hard\\" films were, all three of them did have some goofs and a few bits of inaccurate information. But,\\" Live Free or Die Hard\\" does not have these two flaws--something that proves that Len Wiseman did his homework while making this film, something that makes Wiseman a talented director.    Bottom Line: if you are a fan of the \\"Die Hard\\" series, \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" is not to be missed, as it is top notch and does not disappoint.
0792165020|3.0|If there were separate categories, I'd give this movie five stars for acting and cinematography, three stars for writing, and one star for how it made me feel. I think I was expecting something more along the lines of Matt Damon's \\"Bourne\\" films ... and I got something very different. I don't want to ruin it for anyone who wants to watch the film, but it starts out strange in the sense of mysterious and intriguing, and ends up strange in the sense of weird and kind of grotesque. When I finished watching it, I was left in an odd emotional state: kind of shocked, kind of awed, kind of sick to my stomach, and kind of sad. Like I said, though, the acting and cinematography were amazing.
B000MTDRKE|5.0|Joe Walsh said, \\"It's like your favorite station, playing your favorite song.  Over and over.  On the radio . . .\\" to explain how the music spilled from him.  Neal Morse makes that creative out-pouring seem so much more profound.    The beauty of the life in the age of the iPod is how accessible one's music collection.  I mention this thought because, as I listened to Sola Scriptura, I realized that Neal Morse is slowly unveiling one great work as he pours forth from his well-spring of genius.    This album continues the journey and weaves hits of previous melodies and words to help carry us forward.    Listen to them all together, in order . . . what a wonder of creation.     I just realized the irony of mentioning Joe Walsh  . . . now Neal Morse will never have to play, \\"that Eagles song\\" again.  He has plenty of music playing on his own radio station to keep him busy for many years to come.

B000000WJZ|5.0|This album is so good, it puts a lump in my throat just thinking about it.  Very rarely are there great \\"albums\\" released anymore, where from the first song to the last, the music is strong and artfully arranged to make one complete \\"book\\" of music.  I love this album, I love this sound.  To me, this captures the best of the Pumpkins - the driving guitar and drums.  What is that signature Pumpkins distortion on the guitar?  Amazing.  There's another song out there right now that has a similar sound and screaming vocals.  It's not the SP, but it sure sounds like them!
140003180X|3.0|At this point, entering the fourth book in the series, we are all accustomed to Mma Ramotswe and her alternative brand of mystery. One or two mysteries carry through the book, with a couple more short ones in the midst, balanced with a healthy serving of Mma Ramotswe's wisdom and her reflections on the greatness of Botswana. Always relaxing and mildly suspenseful.<br /><br />This one has a subtle difference: there are no actual mysteries. The agency takes on two cases: one involves tracking down some old acquaintances, and the solution to the other is apparent to the reader within a few lines of the client walking through the door.<br /><br />What does that leave us with? Mma Ramotswe has competition in the form of a rude man who sets up a rival detective agency (Trust your problems to a _man_!, says the ad). The foster children experience growing pains. Mma Makutsi seeks a way to earn some extra cash. Mma Ramotse dispenses wisdom and reflects on Botswana.<br /><br />This is still a very pleasant read, Mma Ramotswe has some good insights to share, and the developments in the characters' personal lives are interesting. If you are lucky enough to have access to the audiobook, Lisette Lecat's narration is excellent and soothing as always. I'm glad I read it, but don't come looking for mystery.

B000O1799U|5.0|Our last Musical movie was the Phantom of the Opera.That one was spectacular, but this one will absolutely take your breath away. It's wide open sets, and absolutely lush voices will have you dancing in your underwear.   Henry Kreiger's amazing musical about three, well four girls, who have a dream is heartbreaking, and moving. The plot is not very rich on the surface, but like an ice cream cake. THe heart of the story is what really matters most.  Jennifer Hudson, Beyonce Knowles, and Anikki Nonni Rose Are astouding. They lay thier notes out better than anyone in the odern world of Motown. And as Jennifer said \\"Simon, YOU WERE WRONG.\\" and actually,(and almost eriely) Her (Jennifer's) storie mirror's her character very well. And so does Beyonce's caracter.   Jamie Fox, and Eddie Murphie are both astounding. And the man who plays James Thunder Early's  Producer (and later Effie's Helper) is wonderful and fatherly. The Language is abounding, but it is not overbearing, like in Black Hawk Down.   So I give a 857345793453 stars out of 5.   WONDERFUL BUY IT AND THE  DELUXE CD AND DRTEAM ON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!111

1582701709|3.0|Disclaimer: I don't own this book.  I own the DVD and I love it.  The information and experience I get from watching the video are invaluable and are already making an impact on my life.    That being said, last night I went into Barnes and Noble to see this book on one of the front display cases, and I picked it up to thumb through it to see what was different about the book from the DVD.  I didn't find anything.  The book contained verbatim quotes from the \\"teachers\\" in the film.  Which isn't bad, it just didn't add anything.    If you prefer reading, get the book.  If you prefer watching it and seeing visual representations of what they're demonstrating, get the DVD.  If you want something to listen to in the car or on the subway, get the audiobook.  Just your personal preference.

B000PJEMUA|5.0|As the author of the Jefferson Airplane book \\"Take Me To A Circus Tent\\" and a former radio disc-jockey, I am often asked to write and or discuss various recordings from the 60's and 70's.<br /><br />The review is to let you know about the CD version upgrade with the five bonus tracks that you can find on Amazon either as part of a package with the first two albums \\"Shades Of\\" and \\"The Book of Taliesyn\\" or by itself.<br /><br />Deep Purple's self-titled third release would bring an end to an amazing chapter of the band.  Ritchie Blackmore, John Lord, and Ian Paice were looking to move into heavier rock territory as well as explore a mixture of classical music with the combination of an orchestra and Purple on stage (Concerto For Group & Orchestra).  Rod Evans (Vocals) and Nick Simper (Bass) would not be part of the most famous of Dee Purple line-ups called \\"Mark II.\\"<br /><br />They still had the business at hand, to record one more record with the initial players.  Coming off two tremendous efforts \\"Shades Of\\" and \\"Book Of Taliesyn\\" this wouldn't be the easiest of tasks.<br /><br />Purple left no doubt from the opening track \\"Chasing Shadows\\" that the album would be off to a grandiose start.  Between Evan's excellent vocal and the Blackmore guitar this was the perfect tune to begin the eight song journey (Not counting the bonus tracks).<br /><br />\\"Blind\\" pays homage to the psychedelic vocals of years past.  These aren't lyrics thrown together to help create rhymes.  They are intense.<br /><br />\\"Lalena\\" is the Donovan tune.  Purple's interpretation is stellar.  Never has the tune sounded so good as it does on the remaster.  Jon Lord's keyboards put you in the recording studio.<br /><br />\\"Fault Line\\" is Blackmore's time to shine.  Between the excellent choice of notes and the effect on the guitar, it is an adventurous ride.<br /><br /> \\"The Painter\\" musically has the listener thinking of an updated \\"Hush.\\"  The lyrics are deeper here and this one deserves to be repeated on the CD player.<br /><br />\\"Why Didn't Rosemary\\" mixes some blues and fifties style rock and roll modernized for the Purple sounds of 69.<br /><br />\\"Bird Has Flown\\" is an exploration to uncharted waters.  It is one step closer to the longer improvisational sounds Purple would achieve next year.  At almost twelve minutes make sure to hold on for the ride.\\"<br /><br />\\"April\\" the ending and longest track on the album is haunting, brilliant, and Blackmore has passages that are mesmerizing.  If his playing peaked here he would still be in the higher echelon of musicians.

B000I5YCCO|4.0|Taylor has a very nice voice and great range.  There are some very nice songs on the album.  However, I agree that she is definitely writing for a teen audience...which is actually refreshing these days since she is a teenager!

0064471837|5.0|Perhaps the best testimony I can give for Sabriel (and Lireal and Abhorsen) is that I reread them occasionally, even though I am a grown-up who is very *picky* about my reading choices. In this trilogy, Nix creates two cultures, sharing continguous geographic space, that are de facto in opposition to each other with no actual intent to be so. *ARGH* This sounds so dry--you really need to try out Sabriel. Both she and the book/s are so much more than I'm getting at here--particularly if you have teenage girls who might also be inspired.<br /><br />For adults, the writing and characterization are somewhat less complex than one would normally expect in adult fiction; however, they are more so than in much of adult fantasy--at least by my personal judgement. The world is very different, richly imagined and internally coherent; and the characters are real people to an extent rarely found in Young Adult lit. This is an excellent story very well told, and if you admire \\"adult authors\\" like Hobbs for her complexity, Martin for his compelling characters, or Zelazny or Bishop for their fascinating worlds, you will enjoy Nix's \\"Abhorsen\\" trilogy.<br /><br />For Young Adult audiences, parents should be warned that, while there are *no* even minorly sexually explicit scenes, the text does on occasion refer to \\"lovers\\" and bastard children in the second and third books. If your child has already read Twilight, s/he won't find anything more titillating here. If not, my recommendation is that you read it yourself first--if you share an interest in fantasy with your kids you will *not* find it merely an exercise in judicious parenting.<br /><br />Overall, in my opinion, the bravery and perseverance of these very real characters outweighs other minor considerations in what they have to communicate to younger audiences, but I am not a parent. I am, however, a grateful adult to Nix for not pulling his punches in order to make this trilogy more clearly suitable to one audience or the other.
032147404X|5.0|This book is somewhat basic and I expected it, but mostly what I was looking for.  If you don't have time to read long articles this is the cliff notes of all of that, and great for a busy person with kids!  With Scott's hints, I can point and shoot many of my SLR shots.
0553588486|5.0|This series is gripping and rates highly amongst the best of fantasy, but you might want to save it in your \\"Wish List\\" as something to read when it's done. Martin is *very* busy *not* finishing it and you don't need to join the legions of \\"Martinized\\" fans waiting on the next book. Even worse, the last one was only *half* a book with the stories of the other half of the characters we eagerly anticipated not represented.<br /><br />Stuff happens; series don't get finished. Martin's reticence, however, is more than the normal lag time of inspiration. Perhaps it's not a fair assessment, but I get the feeling that he himself finds these characters and this world so compelling that he gives them to us reluctantly. He doesn't want to let go either--much to his credit as an author and our enjoyment as readers, but frustrating in its entirety.
B000O5AYCA|5.0|Honestly...I think I like this record more than the first two (and probably third) Interpol albums. I also like it more than the National's last record, \\"Alligator\\", which was GREAT.     This record is SOOOOOOOO much more than just some Joy Division rip-off. There is a boatload of Americana and folk influence to this record...along with a biting critique of modern American urban life. Great songs about relationships and about our place in the world.     I saw these guys play at the Duck Room in St Louis and they were incredible. I really hope this band blows up because of this record...I listen to it as a whole so much that I cannot even pick a favorite song!
B000ICL3KG|3.0|And then decide for yourself once you've actually heard a competing viewpoint. You can find it on YouTube or other video sites like Google.    I suspect most of the people on this board predicting the end of the world have only heard Al Gore's take. Likewise, I suspect most of the people on the \\"Great Global Warming Swindle\\" posts have not seen \\"An Inconvenient Truth.\\" But data from pols, classroom studies, and debates have shown viewer opinion on global warming swings wildly once they hear another side of the issue. Many with supposedly intractable opinions have changed their minds after a mere 90 minutes exposure to either program.    I think everyone with a strong opinion or curiosity on the subject of global warming owes it to themselves to see both sides of this issue and then make the most informed decision possible, not just listen to one side and think it's a done deal. And that applies to the \\"end of civilization\\" crowd as well as the \\"global warming is a myth\\" crowd. I'd be a lot more willing to take someone seriously who I know hasn't just been exposed to one side's take only.

For starters I have all the version of Stars Wars and the DVDs what's up with the Jabba the Hutt in the hangar with Han Solo in A New Hope, it look like he was really young and in the Return he was and old guy I don't buy it.    Also the Mr. Jar Jar I just don't like these character, the light sabers effect they didn't do anything to put them better and last but not least the ending of the Return they change Sebastian Shaw for Hayden Christensen this was a cheap shot from the Lucas Camp, but after all is said and done this is a must have collection for two things:    The most important first - the bonus disk (excellent)  The second most important thing is the package - the best in history.

B000FZETKC|5.0|This is a movie that didn't get the attention of others movies in the 80's (Weird Science, Pretty in Pink, Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club) but it sits right up there with them, this film has one of the best soundtracks of the 80's but is missing to songs Beats so Lonely from Charlie Sexton and Catch my Fall of Billy Idol.    In some parts is like Pretty in Pink but with a more real feel to it, all the young actors are in the top of there game (Eric Stolz, Lea Thompson, Mary Stuart Masterson and the always good Craig Sheffer) here but Candace Cameron and Elias Koteas steal this film with there portrait of Keith Sister and the School Badie, vintage John Hughes for the people that where in High School that time this is a must have DVD in your collection of great eighties films about High School crowd.
0316018953|4.0|Hieronymus Bosch is a great character developed by Michael Connelly over the years.  Connelly has been quoted to, in effect, state that he will keep writing about Harry Bosch as long as he can continue to develop the character as an individual.  While this book is short, which USUALLY connotes a writer under contract to pump out books of dubious value, here the writing is up to the authors general high standards for both plot and character development.  Bosch is just beginning to age but is as clever and crafty as ever.  And incorrigible.  His eclectic tastes and unusual tactics are always a pleasure to read about.<br /><br />The book is short but we always want to check in on our old friend Harry.  Connelly again proves why he is not only a best selling writer but one of the true masters at the genre.  Read this book, in fact, read them all.  I have yet to find one I did not enjoy and, perhaps sadly, I have read them all.
B000OPOANE|5.0|This is quite simply the best RUSH album since, well, ever. It's simply astounding. It combines the best of RUSH - the technical audacity, rhythmic complexity, lyrical brilliance - with a depth of feeling and emotion that has been shown on occasion in the past ( Losing it, Mystic Rhythms) , but this time is pervasive thruout the album. It really does take several listens to 'get' a RUSH album ( just try to hum along with the intro to 'Far Cry' , if you can figure that rhythm out in a day without writing it down you're a better man that I ), but once you conquer it intellectually , the rewards are tremendous. Too many times in the past RUSH have challenged us that way , only for us to find there wasn't a lot there once the mental work had been done. I am generalizing of course, but I can't think of another RUSH record that is this consistently three dimensional from start to finish.     Get it. And get the MVI. The documentary is such a treat for an old fan like me....I bought my first RUSH record in 1976 just because I liked the cover. The drum kit looked so cool ( All the World's a Stage )
B000NVIXFK|4.0|With every new album, Rush has invented musical trends and re-invented their sound in the process.  The latest effort, \\"Snakes and Arrows,\\" is no different.    There's something for everyone on this disc, from soaring melodies, to bluesy, classic-sounding riffs, to in-your-face rock-a-thons, to beautiful acoustic passages.  While some songs provide catchy, radio-friendly hooks, others are atypical and use melodies and counter-melodies to great effect.    Drummer Neil Peart's lyrics offer an introspective, somewhat resigned outlook on life and modern-day humanity, beautifully expressed by Geddy Lee's vocals, which have become quite mellow and refined with age.  Never have the lyrics and vocals combined with such subtlety and yet with such potency.  The magic of the lyrics is that they convey their outlook on life without being ponderous, overly melancholy, or preachy; and challenge the listener to extract his or her own meanings from personal experiences.    Comparisons to earlier material are difficult to analyze, for Rush is a progressive band whose product changes with every album.  While it shares some of the traits of yesteryear, such as time-stop arrangements and the occasional adventurous rhythm, it trades the raw, anthemic style of old for sophistication and substance.  This has produced an album that stands on its own - however uniquely - with any of Rush's finest previous output.    The point of any work of art is to inspire and to invite some level of personal connection.  In this album's case, whether via the intimate acoustic moments, the powerhouse rock, or everything in between, the music succeeds in expressing the human condition in a very world-relevant way, while letting the listener decide how.

I look forward to the next CD already, even though I'm still thrilled by this one.
B000957O82|4.0|Typically when I'm choosing a movie to watch in my spare time, I will choose from action, drama, comedy, sci-fi, thrillers, etc. (what you would basically expect from any guy), I can honestly say that I very rarely choose a romantic comedy, and never a musical. However, sometimes a romantic comedy comes along that looks interesting and funny to me, generally because the premise is different from most or because I like the stars in it, or simply because my wife chooses the movie for our movie night. In the case of \\"Hitch\\" it was a combination of the first 2 factors, but for some reason my wife and I never got around to watching this movie in theaters, and for the longest time on DVD. But recently, we sat down and watched it, and I must say that even though many critics and some moviegoers weren't entertained that much by the movie, I found it to be highly enjoyable and one of the better romantic comedies I had seen.    \\"Hitch\\" is the story of Alex 'Hitch' Hitchens (Will Smith), a man whose job is to find ways for a man to successfully woo the woman of his choice into a successful dating relationship. Hitch is a man that is good at his job, but never really finds the time for his own dating life. When Hitch begins coaching a pudgy accountant (Kevin James) on how to get noticed by an attractive, wealthy heiress, his own love life begins to blossom, but through a series of mishaps starts to go horribly awry. Inevitably leaving Hitch wondering why he can make love happen for complete strangers but never for himself. But before he can figure out what's going on in his life, a newsreporter (Eva Mendes) is trying to uncover the true identity of this so-called 'Date Doctor', and after protecting his identity for so long Hitch finds himself in the media crosshairs, and the real kicker is, it's his new girlfriend that put him there.    As far as romantic comedies go, most of them are generally predictable to some extent, sometimes the predictability of these types of films lends to boredom for me. However, there are a few romantic comedies that manage to be predictable, yet still entertain, and then there are the few (very few) that just surprise you by not being all that predictable. \\"Hitch\\" falls somewhere between somewhat predictable and not all that much, there are the typical romantic comedy elements that are crucial for this type of film. For example, guy finds girl, impresses girl, things get serious, some secret about guy is discovered by girl, girl breaks up with guy, guy proclaims love for girl, and all is well with the world - those are your basic elements (give or take one or two) to almost every romantic comedy these days, and \\"Hitch\\" contains several of them. The difference for me was that unlike a lot of other romantic comedies where the story is so thin and the humor is virtually non-existent that you find yourself already knowing how the movie will end and checking your eyelids for holes within the first 30 minutes due to boredom, \\"Hitch\\" keeps things going at a very steady pace with plenty of laughs and clever dialogue that I never got distracted by getting ahead of the story, and remained entertained throughout. Probably the element I enjoyed the most of the movie was the way the character of Hitch had taken a by-the-book approach to dating, as far as his tips go, that worked like a charm for every guy that he tutored, yet could never get the same approach to work for him, and in the end he discovers that love, much like life, isn't always so simply figured out.    The performances by the cast were uniformly strong, Will Smith and Kevin James out-shined everyone, which wasn't really all that surprising given their comedic and acting talents. Eva Mendes was very endearing as the woman that Hitch is trying to start a relationship with, and she shows a great on-screen chemistry with Will Smith that made their couple very believable. The story as I said earlier contained many of the familiar elements of most romantic comedies, yet still entertained me, and I never felt like I'd seen it all before. The ending is what you expect, and of course hope for in this type of movie, but the execution of the ending was done in a very interesting and unique way that I didn't expect, probably making it a much more enjoyable ending than most.    With all of that being said, \\"Hitch\\" isn't the most original romantic comedy, but there are numerous elements that are unique, and allowed me to overlook the same old elements that are so tried and true to this genre. It was a very entertaining movie, that provides you plenty of laughter and leaves you feeling good, which is what these movies should do.    \\"Hitch\\" is rated PG-13 for language and sensuality.
B000002OX7|5.0|The period of the mid 60's through the mid 70's represents the Golden Age of Rock and Roll for me.  The sheer number of great rock and roll albums that came out during this time has never and will never be equaled. Who's Next is undoubtedly the Who's best and also one of the best from the golden age. This disc is a must have for any true rock and roll fan and if you don't have it you are seriously doing yourself a disservice.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|Kelly Clarkson's third CD My December has blown away all the doubts I had after hearing all the negative press surrounding it. The CD surprised me in a lot of ways and has replaced Breakaway as my favorite Kelly CD. Whereas it may not spawn 8 number one singles like a factory, it does have songs that are moving and well-written by Clarkson. My favorite songs on the album would have to be Be Still and Maybe. Although I listen to the entire CD on repeat these two stand out the most for me. I love them, love the CD, love Kelly. This CD is definitely worth buying and listening to even if you are upset because Kelly stood strong and went against being another hit single machine. This album rocks my world.

B000M06K5C|4.0|There was a time, about a year and a half ago, when I considered Bloc Party to be one of my favorite bands. I listened to their debut, Silent Alarm, almost obsessively and still consider it one of my favorite albums - whether I needed something energetic or pensieve, I could, and still can, find it on that album.<br /><br />Naturally I was excited about A Weekend In The City before I ever heard it, and upon hearing it I wasn't sure what to think. The first six of the album's eleven songs grew on me immensely, while the second half of the album blurred together without any of the songs making an impression on me. Upon revisiting them, I realized that the immediately listenable songs didn't necessarily have longterm playability; conversely, the five final songs reflect just as much, if not more care than the other tracks -unfortunately, when listened to consecutively, they do tend to sound similar. Listen to them separately, and they really do shine: particularly, 'I Still Remember' and 'Sunday' didn't really grab me when I first heard them, but now rank among my favorites by the band.<br /><br />All in all, AWITC is a slower album to enjoy than its predecessor, with more of a focus on setting soundscapes than writing hooks for catchy choruses. If you enjoyed the more contemplative parts of Silent Alarm, you'll love A Weekend in the City. Otherwise, expect to spend more time becoming acquainted with the work here.
6305897786|4.0|Opinions when it comes to movies tend to convey a bit more stridency than those involving music or even television, as if a level of aesthete is involved that is so profound that it evokes a part of one's being... of course, that may just apply to the more catty drama dorks out there.    Anyhow, there are many examples too numerous for practical purposes of documenting.  To focus on just one good example would be THE NINTH GATE.  Many people disliked this film, and some did so with a hint of indignation.  It might have been because of raised expectations, either for their adulations of Roman Polanski as a director, or because it was a film featuring the \\"divinely magnificent\\" Johnny Depp (who actually is an exceptionally good actor with a decent knack for picking projects; comments in quotations were not meant as an affront to Mr. Depp, but to those who overly idolize him), or because this film deals with elements of the supernatural including the Devil.  If in fact you are expecting a terrifying episode of demonic encounters replete with gore and sensationalism, then you might not like this film, which has a more stately pacing and emphasizes ambiance and atmosphere over glitzy special effects.  Others were disappointed because the film only partially reflects the book it was based on (\\"Club Dumas\\", which I actually also read - pretty impressive, huh?), although to be fair, the book's structure would not have really been ideal for close adaptation.    I admit that I was really intrigued by the premise, especially when the element of interaction by Lucifer was suggested, because done well it can be fascinating, although it is also runs the big risk of embarrassing failure, given the heightened expectations.  The trailers were effective enough, and Johnny Depp picks good movies more often than not, so I thought it was worth a look.  The movie was not quite what I expected, but still kept my interest, in spite of the aforementioned moderate pacing and a subject matter(rare book appraisals) which I would not have ordinarily found especially fascinating.  It was an intellectual rather than visceral effort, and the acting was actually somewhat effective as it turns out.  Though some have incorrectly characterized the acting as being lackadaisical and/or stilted or uninspiring (among the many adjectives used), the director and actors wisely chose a more understated approach, which is more realistic and less (melo)dramatic.  As a result, Depp was convincing in his role as a mercenary book appraiser not always above unscrupulous methods, and Frank Langella was quite effective in his role as an accomplished but ruthless publisher and collector, whose sophistication almost masks his sinister agenda.  Their nuanced performances were far more appropriate and believable, rather than over-the-top affectations which would have just come off as campy and out of place (Sean Penn and Al Pacino and Tom Cruise need not have auditioned).    The story centers on a book titled \\"The Ninth Gate of the Kingdom of Shadows\\", an obscure but legendary tome rumored to have Lucifer as a contributor.  Depp's character is Dean Corso, a highly sought though morally relaxed appraiser.  He is hired by Boris Balkan (Langella) to find other remaining copies - if they still exist - to determine the book's authenticity.  What seemed initially like a thorough and arduous investigation came to include hazardous intrigue, the interventions of mysterious strangers, untimely deaths, and more danger than Corso was prepared for.  Along the way, the financial appeal of the lucrative assignment gives way to the need for answers to the danger and intrigue, which in turn gives way to a pursuit of something possibly unworldly and beyond belief.  Though some will stubbornly disagree, I think what helps make this film work is the element of ambiguity regarding the book's authenticity and nature, as well as those of at least one other character in the film, and the film's ending itself.      As I am not an easy laugh, I tend to be a challenging audience for comedies.  Similarly, I am not an easy scare and do not impress easily when it comes to horror films.  Though I am not sure that this would be accurately categorized as a horror film (it could be more accurately described as a supernatural thriller), I will risk the razzing and aspersions and insults to say that one of the more scary/frightening/evocative (as measured by the goosebump meter) sequences I have ever come across in movies is in this film.  Polanski is regarded by some as a genius, though not all his films are well received.  If you can dispense with any preconceived expectations and approach this with an open mind, there is a decent chance you might find this film's merits as both a creative project and a skillfully crafted effort.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|I love all kinds of music, but mostly heavy metal and progressive metal like Iron Maiden, Stratovarius, Slayer, Megadeth, Edguy, WASP! I even listen to Cannibal Corpse and Killswitch Engage when I am working out.<br /><br />I swore up and down I would never own an American Idol CD! I liked a couple of songs off of Kelly's Breakaway CD and bought it.  I like a lot of the songs on it, but mostly it is just a pop CD.  Her Thankful CD is slow and very much just a pop CD.  I really don't like it at all.<br /><br />My December shows her musical talent and songwriting ability.  I really like the fact that she has stuck to her guns and created an album like she wanted.  She didn't sell out and didn't fold under the pressure of the producers that wanted this album to be just another pop album.  Have you listened to Avril Lavigne's new CD?  She folded and sold out horribly.  It sounds like Gwen Stefani with a faster rock edge to it.  You have got to be kidding me.  How she could release a CD like that and still have any self-respect after her first two albums I will never know.<br /><br />Anyway, Kelly Clarkson has created a masterpiece!<br /><br />I have nothing but the utmost respect for her now.  Forget that American Idol crap!  This is real music!<br /><br />C-ya!<br /><br />Ronnie
B000QFCD5O|5.0|Asia has released numerous live cd's, all of them good, but most not having that signature sound from the original incarnation of the band. This one changes all of that. This is the band that deserves to carry the Asia name.

B000JIHP88|5.0|I was so excited when I purchased this that I brought it home and attached it to the crib immediately.  It was so easy to put together and even easier at entertaining my daughter.  The colors are so vibrant and the animals just loveable.  The music is soothing with the volume just loud enough for sensitive baby ears.  I can lay my daughter down in her crib and her rainforest friends keep her busy while I get things done.  She smiles at them and talks to them and it is such pure joy watching it.  I don't know who enjoys this mobile more.....baby, my husband, or myself.  It is a must have for all families.
B000002MY3|5.0|When i first heard Alanis Morissette, it was in 1995 when \\"You Oughta Know\\" played on the radio.  My first reaction to Morissette and \\"You Oughta Know\\" was not positive - it was \\"what is this, why is this woman so angry, and what is this chip on her shoulder?\\"   Most of the \\"bubble gum\\" and synth-pop of the 1980s was beginning to fade, yet Morissette's anger just seemed too raw for me to absorb at the time. However as the subsequent singles (\\"Ironic\\", \\"Head Over Feet\\", \\"Hand in my Pocket\\") from Morissette's \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" album were released, I soon began to see more than an angry young woman.   This got me curious enough - especially when the Grammy for Album of the Year was awarded to Morissette for \\"Jagged Little Pill\\".  Once I acquired this album, I was blown away.   There was so much more to this album than just an angry woman.  After listening to the album many times, I even came around to discovering an appreciation to \\"You Oughta Know\\".    No doubt that this album backed up a lot of the praise and sales that it racked up.    Many may be turned off by Morissette's raspy and screeching voice.   However, Morissette demonstrates she has great vocal range - especially on \\"Jagged Little Pill\\".   Barry Gibb built his falsetto into his own personal trademark and an integral part of his vocals.  In a way, Morissette has established a trademark with her raspy and screechy voice.   But as you listen to the voice, it is folded into her music at the appropriate times - making it very effective.  Morissette's contributions focus around vocals, but she also contributes some harmonica.    A lot of credit for this album should go to Morissette's producer and collaborator, Glen Ballard.   Ballard, does a great job at co-writing the music for the songs - providing a good mix of electric and acoustic guitars (which Ballard plays along with keyboards on several tracks).  It is also clear that Ballard does a very effective job as a producer and gets the most out of Morissette on each of these tracks.    It is best looking at this track by track.    \\"All I Really Want\\": This song gives us an introduction to Morissette, the trademark screeching, her terrific vocal ranges, and some terrific electric guitar.  We hear the anger in the lyrics - \\"I like to reel it in and then spit it out; I'm frustrated by your apathy\\", yet the lyrics \\"And all I really want is some patience; A way to calm the angry voice\\" indicate Morissette may want to calm it down a bit.    \\"You Oughta Know\\": Now I look at this song with sheer genius.   The song deals with Morissette's angry reaction of being jilted by her lover.   While the song starts with Morissette taking the high road, it launches into a scathing attack on her former lover.   Terrific guitar and bass work by Dave Navarro and Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers respectively really add to the effect, but ultimately it will be Morissette's outstanding vocal range that will bring this song to life.    \\"Perfect\\": This is another song where Morissette's vocal range really helps bring the song to life.  The acoustic guitar start translated into the harder electric guitar is brilliant.   Morissette plays the role of a strong mother putting pressure on her child for perfection.    \\"Hand in My Pocket\\":  Morissette doesn't demonstrate the anger that is seen on the previous tracks.  We hear some of her harmonica on a song in which Morissette confesses some of the hypocrisies that are going on in here life. (i.e. \\"I feel drunk but I'm sober\\")    \\"Right Through You\\": Great track and hear is where Morissette's trademark raspy voice comes along at the right times on the song.  There is also some terrific electric guitar on this song that deals with a woman \\"seeing right through\\" a man.    \\"Forgiven\\": This may be the one controversial track on the album as we hear Alanis questioning her Catholic upbringing on this song.   More outstanding trademark vocals by Morissette.    \\"You Learn\\": This is the most pop-friendly track as it deals with learning painful lessons in life.       \\"Head Over Feet\\": This is probably the \\"softest\\" track on the collection.  It deals with being smitten in love - a nice contrast to a lot of the anger Morissette shows on the other tracks.    \\"Mary Jane\\": This is a narrative that Morissette tells about someone called \\"Mary Jane\\".  Morissette's vocal range might be the strongest on this track.  This proves Morissette's voice doesn't need to be raspy or screeching to work.    \\"Ironic\\": Also a pop-friendly song.  Morissette sings about the ironies in life.  Here we hear Morissette's trademark voice can work in the pop setting.    \\"Not the Doctor\\":  Might be the strongest track on the collection.  The song deals with Alanis' frustrations at being the strong woman in a relationship and not wanting her man to depend on her.  Again more trademark vocals and the right mix of acoustic and electric guitars.    \\"Wake Up\\":  This is probably the second strongest track on the collection.  The song has the best overall instrumentation on the album.  It is the perfect \\"wrap up\\" to the collection as it as \\"finale\\"-like qualities.   Same message as on most of the other tracks - terrific trademark Morissette vocals.    There is also an alternate version of \\"You Oughta Know\\" that has a heavier bass influence, but still sounds very similar to the original.  About a minute following that track is a terrific a cappella by Morissette called \\"Your House\\".  Morissette does very well carrying out an a cappella.    The liner notes include all of the lyrics (except for the bonus \\"Your House\\").  This album truly has cemented its place in music history and has probably put Morissette on the road to the Hall of Fame.  There is not one weak track on this collection.  This is one outstanding musical work - very highly recommended.
B000P0J02E|5.0|I must say that the score may actually be better than the movie itself!  Not to bash the movie, I did enjoy it immensely- but the Score is just unbelievably amazing!<br /><br />Unlike many other franchsie scores, by the third and fourth part the score can become a little boring and redudnent, \\"At World's End\\" not only keeps up with tradition and has a sound that ramins true to the other two scores, but it has enough to make it completely original and fresh.<br /><br />The score is amazing at evoking emotions from the listener, I heard the score prior to watching the film, and had an amazing understanding of the emotional content from this score.<br /><br />\\"Hoist the Colors\\" not only starts out the soundtrack and the film, but it sets the mood and story for the film, and the theme reoccuers throughout the score.<br /><br />\\"At Wit's End\\" is hauntingly beautiful and evokes a sense of mystery and sadness. \\"Calypso\\" is an amazing piece that grows from a mysterious haunting melody to a ferocious and rolling score complete with a choir that grows ever larger (which is PERFECT for the scene)<br /><br />My personal favorite pieces are \\"What Shall We Die For\\" and \\"I Don't Think Now is the Best Time\\".  The tracks are all part of one scene. \\"What Shall We Die For\\" is almost inspirational and has an amzing \\"uplifting\\" quality to it and the track grows bigger and larger and is just phenomonal.  But the artistry of Zimmer and the Pirates score really comes to fruition in the second half of \\"I Don't think Now is the best Time\\" That's almost a ballet of a score that flows from Action mcvie score to romance- it's also one of the more memorable scenes in the film.  The score has a multi-genre feel to it with the score running through Romace film, to western, Action picture and everything in between!<br /><br />As scores go, \\"At World's End\\" really runs the gambit, from quiet and tragic, to desperation, to scary, to Soft and emotional, to hard driving action, to \\"Drink Up Me Hearties\\" that is almost impossible to listen to and NOT picture our Hero, Jack Sparrow, as it rolls into the unforgettable theme in true epic style.<br /><br />My only problem with this score (as with the others in this series) is that at a running time of just under an hour, you do wonder where the other 2 hours of score are!<br /><br />It doesn't quite have the Rock sound that 'Dead Man's Chest\\" had, but it really holds it's own as an unforgettable and amazing piece of work that really captures the spirit of \\"The Pirates of the Caribbean\\" and rounds out the trilogy quite nicelypicture our Hero, Jack Sparrow, as it rolls into the unforgettable theme in true epic style.

0070511136|4.0|The sales guru Zig Ziglar once said \\"People don't care how much you know until they know how much you care.\\" To me, that means that you've got to understand people before you can persuade them. If you're to understand someone, they have to talk to you. And the best way to get them to talk is to ask questions. But are there some questions that are more highly correlated with successful selling than others?<br /><br />Published in 1988 and still one of the best researched sales books on the market, SPIN Selling by Neil Rackham has the answer: Yes, some questions do increase your chances of sales success more than others. More importantly, these client interviews- what SPIN Selling calls the Investigation stage- have the greatest effect on the outcome of the sale. The book outlines the four types of questions that salespeople ask during the Investigation stage:<br /><br />Situation: What is going on here? How do things work?<br /><br />Problem (Pain Points): What are the problems you are experiencing?<br /><br />Implication (Implied Needs): What effect do these problems have on results (cost, quality, delivery, customer service)?<br /><br />Need-Payoff (Explicit Needs): What improvement in results could you make by resolving these problems with these specific capabilities (perceived value)? Are there other benefits? How important are these benefits to you?<br /><br />(From page 91) \\"The SPIN model taps into the psychology of the buying process: buyers' needs move from Implicit to Explicit. The questions provide a roadmap for the seller guiding the call through the steps of need development until Explicit Needs have been reached. The more Explicit Needs you can obtain from buyers, the more likely the call will succeed.\\"<br /><br />Following the model gets customers to tell you how what you're selling helps them. It makes you partners instead of opponents in the value discovery process. And by helping clients develop the benefits in their own words, you avoid objections and make it easier for clients to sell internally for you.you.

If you think that this is one of \\"those movies,\\" you're only half right, and maybe less than half.  This movie is a surprise.  If you are apprehensive of the title, all I can say is \\"Get over it.\\"  You don't want to miss this film.
B000OZ84PO|5.0|One great thing about this book is that it was written just one year after the bombing, so thoughts and opinions were fresh.

We may never understand the complete impact of the first time an atomic bomb was used on a civilian populace, but this small book might help.
6302969352|5.0|I finally did it.  I watched SEVEN SAMURAI, directed by Akira Kurosawa.  The first thing that came to my mind after viewing the film was, \\"Why did I wait so long?\\"  For me, I have no argument with any of the past critics (Pauline Kael, Siskel & Ebert, or the slew of consumers on Amazon).  There is a reason that this magnificent film, by Kurosawa, has been given such high praise, dating all the way back to its release in 1954, when it rightfully received the Venice Film Festival Silver Lion, and was later voted One of the Top Ten Best Films of All Time in the 1992 Sight and Sound International Film Directors' Poll.  Gene Siskel calls it \\"One of the greatest films ever made.  The film that was transformed into the popular western The Magnificent Seven.\\"  [That's another film I have waited far too long to watch!]<br /><br />SEVEN SAMURAI truly has something for everyone, and in its full 208 minutes of glory, the scenes fly by way too quickly.  This remarkable story, based on Japanese history, depicts 16th century Japan, in the wake of a very turbulent chapter in the nation's past.  Peasants and farmers are starving at the hand of ruthless bandits, who are raping and pillaging their rice fields (as well as their people).  Who can save them, but a group of seven bold men [the title's samurai] leading a group of locals into battle, to take on these evil men.  There are moments that are laugh out loud hilarious, followed by great dramatic and action-packed scenes (yes, this is a violent film--but, I am sure, judging from the title, that doesn't surprise you), and even some romance.  The dazzling cast includes Kurosawa regular Toshiro Mifune (YOJIMBO), as well as Takashi Shimura (IKIRU).<br /><br />What makes this film stand out so much (aside from the wonderful acting and engaging story) is the innovation in cinematography that was incredibly progressive for the time that it was made (the 1950s).  This includes bold use of slow motion, a rapid moving camera and long-lens photography.  When my mom was looking over my shoulder, ever so often, she remarked that she could have sworn that this film was shot in color.  I can see why she thought that.  The beautiful attention to light and shadow make you feel the color that the actors and crew must have seen, when they made this.  I saw shades of gold, blue, and red (what with all the bloodshed) as I was watching this.  You just have to watch the film to understand what I'm talking about.  I really don't want to ruin the experience for you.  I hope to see the DVD transfer of this, because I have heard it is far superior to the VHS version.  That's hard to even imagine, for me, because this film sparkles on videotape!  Please watch this and don't wait as long as I did to enjoy SEVEN SAMURAI for the exceptional film that it is.  [As a note to all people weary of subtitles:  You won't even notice them!  This film will make you feel like you understand Japanese, almost.  Visually, this is a film that has the power to transcend all cultural and language boundaries.]hen my mom was looking over my shoulder, ever so often, she remarked that she could have sworn that this film was shot in color.

1594200823|5.0|A fascinating account of four meals; Michael Pollan delivers a captivating overview of the modern food industry. Omnivore's Dillema alludes to the struggle of trying to figure out what it is wise to eat: processed foods, organic, which diet? Instead of relying on the accumulated wisdom of cuisine and culture, a typical North American consumer is apt to go by expert opinion, food pyramids, and fad diet books - all of which have shown little success. If you're curious about the food-chain, or how the food you consume came to be, this may be an eye-opener. Great read, and highly recommended.
B00005JNEI|1.0|I am about as liberal as they come and I couldn't stand this movie. Completely ignoring the fact that this movie has very little in common with real documentaries, this movie begins with a rambling, incoherent conclusion  that repetitiously attacks Bush and his administration in every way conceivably possible. Now, I realize most of us already have opinions on a subject and it is good to be honest about the fact that none of us can truly be impartial. But the whole point of a well-crafted argument is that you provide your audience with copious evidence, and you present it in such an artful way that the audience reaches your conclusion by themselves by the end of the movie. This even-handed persuasion obviously escapes Moore, as the first few minutes of the movie consist of a very hateful rant about Bush and his policies. Only after this rant  does Moore begin to provide any evidence as to why we should hate Bush.  The feeling I got from the movie was of a little kid tattletaling on his older brother. That's not to say I don't agree with the general conclusions. But the point of a movie like this should be persuasion. Liberals don't need convincing that Bush is despicable. It's the moderates and conservatives who need persuading, and this crude and poorly put together \\"documentary\\" surely is not going to do that.

My favorite part of the book is when Charlie is in the truck and says \\"I feel infinite.\\"  This book touched me so much and I have read it once every year for the past 8 years.  The following Christmas, as a gift of graditude, I gave my brother a CD made up of the songs on Charlie's mixed tape.

0156027321|4.0|This novel has the most ludicrous premise: a 16-year-old fights for survival on the open sea, in a lifeboat, occupied only by himself and a 450 lb tiger.  Martel does an excellent job telling the story in a way that makes even the most absurd situations seem believable.  While somewhat slow, the first part of the book gives interesting information on religion and zoos, setting the reader up with the basic idea that Pi is equipped practically and spiritually to handle his situation.  After laying out this information as background on Pi, Martel launches into his tale of a boy, a tiger, and the Pacific Ocean.  I felt that the very ending of the story was its weakest point, a description of another possible scenario of a boy lost at sea.  Furthermore, Martel extensively detailed Pi's religiosity at the beginning of the book but never really went anywhere with it later in the story.  Overall, a book I would highly recommend reading.
B00005O3VD|5.0|The vehicle that made Barbra Streisand a major superstar. From Broadway acclaim, to her 1968 Academy Award winning performance, \\"Funny Girl\\" is Barbra Streisand. When she sings its most familiar number \\"People\\", it seems all time stands still. And to date, there still is no one else who can touch that song but Barbra. As the popular comedic singer/actress Fanny Brice, we're given a lesson of survival through adversity. And Omar Sharif's finest hour since his appearance in \\"Doctor Zhivago\\" as Fanny's gambling addicted first husband Nicky Arnstein. You so much want to see these two succeed as a couple; but alas, it just wasn't to be.     Another standout is the finale, as Barbra so convincingly sings \\"My Man\\" with every award winning emotion imaginable. A note of trivia, Barbra Streisand won her 1968 Best Actress Oscar in a tie with Katherine Hepburn for her grand performance in \\"The Lion In Winter\\". An extreme rarity in Oscar history, having only happened once before back in the 1930s.
1594489505|5.0|A Thousand Splendid Suns is full of very rich, believeable characters. I couldn't put it down and was amazed at the gamut my emotions ran as I read on. Yes, it will give insight into what the people of Afghanistan have suffered, in particular the women- but really the story is more about humanity and hope than cultural issues or sexual discrimination. Not a light read, but a good one.
B000007WNN|5.0|The Cult is on every plane the most underated Rock group of the 80's. This was in my opinion their greatest effort. Electric influenced many more of the best rock groups to follow this 1987 release. Soundgarden, Guns, Alice In Chains. All of these groups were major commercial successes. I don't really know why The Cult never hit bigger. True they weren't as commercial looking as the other groups with they're more gothic look...best way to say it is they were definately before their time. They brought a RAW, ernergetic, original sound to a glam,hairsprayed,polished sound and look of the 80's rock groups. My favorite's off of this A - - kicking album are ...the whole damn album!!! \\"Electric Ocean\\" is a killer smash of a tune, I love Ian's voice on anything...on this album he was just GREAT! Peace Dog is also a killer song.  There is Great guitar throughout this entire album. \\"Love Removal Machine\\" is probably my favorite...it's very hard for me to say that because i love the whole thing. \\"Lil' Devil\\" is also a tune that helped me wear out a cassette tape as one of the other reviewers hadsaid he had done also. \\"Outlaw\\" could be this groups anthum! Also give a listen to the harder version of \\"born to be wild\\"....5 star high energy kick a - - Album!
B000GPIPSS|5.0|What else can be said about this classic tale of the macabre. Bela lugosi set the standard for all vampires to this very day. The movie is a masterpiece of cinema. This latest release has about the sharpest, cleanest print ever seen. There is now detail in the film that probably has not been seen since it's original theatrical run, over 75 years ago! There are some places with grain and some film wear, but considering it is 75 years old, it holds up well. The sound, however stated as \\"re-mastered\\" is distorted and has hiss that i'm sure could have been eliminated with today's modern electronics. The only print to have proper sound is the Original DVD release. Even the Legacy collection has the distorted sound, which i own also, and hoped it would have been fixed in this release. The supplimental material is great and enjoyable. The Philip Glass score has always annoyed the heck out of me and should have been erased long ago! It is the errie silence that makes this film scary. All in all, a great addition to any monster fan's libray. Dracula is the original monster, in all his glory and Bela lugosi, who was a very underrated actor, is marvelous and an icon the world over. A historical note: Bela only played Count Dracula twice, once in this film of course, and 17 years later in \\"Abbott & Costello meet Frankenstein\\"! It's amazing how a single performance in a film would secure him such a place in history. Just watch his facial expressions and body movements, truly spectacular, something no CGI could ever duplicate today! So, Curl up on a stormy halloween night and go back to a time when blood and gore was left to the imagination.. That's what made it so scary...and timeless. Universal set the stage for all monsters then and now. Oh, and don't forget to pick up Frankenstein too!
0316067598|5.0|As an English teacher (reading mostly classics) I don't normally read books like this, but after hearing Marcus on the Today Show, I knew this book would be worth reading. A real page-turner (especially the second half), the book is so vividly told that every battle, every sacrifice, every hardship, and every triumph is vicariously experienced. To know what these men went through in a face-to-face battle against the Taliban (severely out-numbered) was eye-opening.     I had no idea the intricacies that went on in an operation -- whether emotional or physical. It's a miracle that Marcus is even alive after what he (and his team) endured, and what he endured no human should have to experience. This book will make you a better person - not just from the knowledge gained -- but for the fact that it will make you appreciate what men like Marcus do everyday defending our country.
141694737X|1.0|As a mother of an adopted child and a psychologist, I am concerned about the message this book sends.  The child in the book wants a pet, but because they are unacceptable, he repeatedly sends them back.  I want my daughter to know that nothing about her is unacceptable, and nothing could ever make me want to \\"send her back.\\"  The book may be great for children in other situations, but I think it sends the wrong message to adopted children.
0345404475|4.0|Imagine a post apocalyptic world devoid of almost all natural life. Radioactive dust falls constantly. Humans artificially adjust their moods and are reminded of their humanity in a group consciousness merging of emotions - the cult of Mercer.  Into this void, unbidden and forbidden, come a group of \\"replicant\\" humanoid androids that can no longer bear the conditions and loneliness of their lives in the outer worlds, where there are sent to do tasks too dangerous for humans.  It is the duty of the police to `retire' i.e. destroy these rogue androids, who are superior in all aspects of body and intelligence to humans, but lack empathy. Welcome to \\"Do androids dream of electric sheep\\"   \\"Blade Runner\\" was, and still is my favorite movie. Many of you may also have been intrigued by the eclectic name of this novel and like me have been exposed to it in the credits of the film. I had an inescapable feeling that there was so much that I was missing in the movie, and eventually read the novel to explore this.   The book is much more complex (yes, really!!) than the movie, and the movie plot has some serious deviation from the theme expressed in the book especially in the portrayal of the character Rachel. However each art form stands alone well and these variations should not deplete ones enjoyment of the other.   So if you have ever wondered at the beauty of the owl, why the apartment buildings are so empty, the complexity of Decker's anti hero or simply wish to ponder the big questions of life, love, humanity and religion, then this book is a must.
B00004SYWZ|3.0|Luis Mejia (son)- Finally, A-ha decides to continue with their classic line up and start with new material. This was the first album I heard from A-ha, and even though I like the album, I also notice that there's something missing. A-ha came up with a new experimentation, a mild experimentation, and I was expecting the old fashioned A-ha, the same that we love. Well, I gotta admit, they thought it well because synthpop and ballads are completely old fashioned and they would never attract a new audience, but even though couldn't they left just one song in an old way?<br /><br />It's also noticed that they focused more on rock pieces and alternative moods, the guitars of Paul are amazing, and the use of a mild orchestra in almost every song is a new and nice touch. Within the songs the title track, Summer Moved On, The Sun Never Shone That Day and Thought That It Was You are excellent pieces perfect for adaptating for the new rythm of the album, they have moderate guitars, electronic arrengements and as I named before a great instrumentation. The songs To Let You Win, Velvet and You'll Never Get Over Me are songs that could be easily associated with the style of East Of The Sun..., but still experimental. The rest of the tracks are good, but lazy and out of tune.<br /><br />In conclusion I would say that it's the worst among the best of A-ha's albums, but appreciatable after all.
B000OCXFCO|3.0|This Album is 47 minutes and 58 seconds long. Taking exception to older albums that were limited to a cassette or older, it rather upsets me when bands do not fill the space given on a CD (80 minutes max) they used just over half. Perhaps it is not their fault and we should put the blame on the record label, but I was deprived of about 32 minutes of potential music.
B000001FN3|5.0|Luis Mejia (son)- Although the incredible duo of Parsons and Woolfson has always released all their albums alike, this is truly an incredible debut for Alan Parsons in the world of bands. He shows the great experience of being a music engineer. No one expected but less, this album is musically complex, serious and about (casually) my favorite writter, Edgar Allan Poe. Even when it was the last album I heard of them, mainly because it wasn't that famous, I knew in that instant that it was their best. The songs that explode the album's potential are A Dream Within A Dream and The Raven, being both a sound innovation, with electronical arrangements and voice distortion, a mild orchestra and best of all the incredible voice of Alan Parsons. Another song that is expectacular is The Cask Of Amontillado, even though the music is mostly played by an orchestra ,the lyrics about the poem and the incredible voice applied is amazing. The Fall Of The House Of Usher is a song that shouts in every aspects how Parsons know what he's doing, almost a classical composition.<br /><br />How to forget The Tell-Tale Heart, even when it doesn't express the tension and horror of the poem and it's situation, is another song that fits perfectly. To One In Heaven and (The System Of) Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether are very popular songs among all their works, appreciated later in time 'cause the album wasn't very popular at the time of the release, but this 2 songs show Parson's inclination to pop and to more comprehensible and soft sounds later expressed in his other works.<br /><br />The album also starts a long time collaboration and friendship with the singers John Miles and Chris Rainbow. Being a dark, cultural piece it differences a lot from the other of the Project's albums such as Eye In The Sky, but it shoes every little aspect that The Alan Parsons Project showed through their later career.
6304474652|4.0|Fools Rush In brings to the screen the love story between a yuppie WASP from New York City and a young Mexican woman from Las Vegas.  Following an unexpected one-night stand the two go their own separate ways.  As luck (or fate for that matter) would have it, the two are far from seeing the last of each other...  Though not a masterpiece, it is a romantic comedy guaranteed to provide more than a just a few laughs.    Matthew Perry, Salma Hayek, (both of whom are simply GORGEOUS!) and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are wonderful to say the least.    The setting, the dialogues, and the humor are all good.  Overall, Fools Rush In is a movie definitely worth watching, and even though you might want to stop short of adding it to your collection, it will surely put you in a good mood!
B000002KBA|1.0|Okay, I don't think My Chemical Romance could churn out a song as banal or inane as \\"Speed King\\" if they tried, and that's the second-best song on the album. Anybody else seeing a problem? This erases all the effort by superior acts like the Beatles and Jimi Hendrix to establish rock as a legitimate art form. Take \\"Bloodsucker\\". It's even duller than \\"Speed King\\", believe it or not. Three of these songs run at epic lengths, including one (\\"Child in Time\\") being stretched longer than ten - \\"Child\\" has got to be the most painful song Purple ever recorded, a blundered attempt to combine opera (listen to Gillan's shrieking vocal histrionics and Jon Lord's painful haunted-house organ) and hard rock (listen to Blackmore's unspectacular, clumsy, loud pentatonic twiddling). Sounds interesting in theory, but it's a good thing virtually nobody else tried this. I can't call it the worst song on the album because it gave me a good chuckle (which I'm sure wasn't intended), but it sure comes pretty close. The other two (\\"Flight of the Rat\\", \\"Hard Lovin' Man\\") are basically just your average Deep Purple songs (or, should I say, sub-average Deep Purple songs) dragged out as long as possible. Ouch. \\"Into the Fire\\" is everything I hate about Deep Purple: soulless and derivative, with Gillan wailing away as usual. I'm sorry, but I don't like his voice. At all. Now I do like \\"Livin' Wreck\\" - cool riff, interesting drumming - but it's almost ruined by Ian's shrieked backup vocals. This is insipid, soulless, and overrated. So's Deep Purple. Go figure.
B000N6UERK|5.0|Deja Vu brings to the screen the story of an ATF agent as he tries to find those responsible for detonating a bomb aboard a riverboat in New Orleans killing hundreds of people.  The investigation will lead to some unexpected discoveries including one that would blow most peoples' minds in a heartbeat...  There are slight hints of the X-Files, and strong elements of Timecop (Jean Claude Van Damme), Frequency (Dennis Quaid, James Caviezel), and The Lake House (Keanu Reeves, Sandra Bullock).  Denzel Washington, Paula Patton, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few thrills, not to mention a few tears.    The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all wonderful!  In conclusion, Deja Vu is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection as it is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over.  4.5 Stars
B000PMFS2I|4.0|If you previously bought the SHOWGIRLS VIP edition - this is the exact same disc only packaged without the box and all the trinkets that came with that edition.  You get commentary by a guy who is a fan of the movie and helps host late night screenings, the Scores girls talk about stripping and critique those sequences, and there's an old promotional piece made during shooting that is called \\"A Diary\\".  The transfer is good and the extras are fun, though none of them seem to cover anybody associated with the film.  If you did not purchase the glam deluxe box set this is a cheap way to get all those features without hunting it down.  Otherwise if you have that edition, this is merely a double dip and repackaging of the same disc with new cover art.<br /><br />This is the NC-17 cut and no additional material has been added.  If you have that edition already there is no difference in the movie at all.  There are no deleted or extended scenes.  This is the version shown in theatres and released twice before on DVD.<br /><br />SHOWGIRLS begs for better extras.  I would love to hear a director's commentary or Elizabeth Berkley and Gina Gershon talk about the film.  But that hasn't happened yet.  Maybe one day we can hope for a Criterion edition and all the stops will be pulled out!

B00005JPFC|5.0|\\"Ratatouille\\" is Pixar's greatest accomplishment to date, which is saying a heck of a lot considering that this is the same brilliant company responsible for films like \\"Toy Story,\\" \\"Finding Nemo\\" and \\"The Incredibles.\\"<br /><br />The movie is set in Paris, where some of the world's most famous chefs have launched their careers. Remy, a very likeable rat, has a gourmet nose and amazing culinary skills. Sadly, his dreams of becoming a chef seem pretty farfetched due to the limitations of his species. However, Remy eventually teams up with Linguini, a gangly young man who lands a job as a garbage boy in one of the most famous restaurants in Paris. Linguini is quite possibly the worst cook ever, but he and Remy devise a method of working together in the kitchen: Remy hides under Linguini's white chef's hat and tugs on the boy's hair to give him commands. As a result, Linguini quickly becomes one of the most sought-after cooks in all of Paris, with a lot of help from his \\"little chef.\\"<br /><br />Even though this is a Pixar/Disney film, there's something about it that reminds me of the classic animated cartoons from many, many years ago (you know, when Disney cartoons were actually good). \\"Ratatouille\\" is visually stunning and a joy to watch. The characters appear to be three-dimensional, and the beautiful Parisian scenery is a great background throughout the film. There are so many amazing characters in this movie, too: scruffy and adorable Remy, bumbling Linguini, sassy Colette, and Skinner (my personal favorite), an angry little man who reminds me of a non-monkey version of Mojo Jojo from \\"The Powerpuff Girls.\\"<br /><br />I loved, loved, LOVED this movie! It's a very solid story that's chock full of smart humor, colorful characters, and lots of action and excitement. This is a movie that kids and adults will enjoy very much. I plan to go see it again in the theatre.

0800141660|5.0|I have a preference for 19th century movies and books.  This movie did not disappoint me.  The actors and actresses all fit so perfectly into their roles.  It was like magic to see them perform.      The Dashwood women, Elinor, Marianne and Margaret with along with their mother are forced to leave a life of luxury when Mr. Dashwood dies and they move into a cottage in the country. (Women have no rights to inherit when a man dies.)  The money usually is given to the eldest sons in the family.  The women must find another means to survive unless the one who inherits is generous enough to allow them to stay on.  In this case, the greed of the son's wife overrules the son and the women are pressed upon to leave very quickly.    The oldest daughter develops a romantic interest in her half brother's wife's brother-in-law, but the sister-in-law makes certain that they are separated so that nothing more can develop.    The younger of the two oldest daughters abandons sensible conduct and rushes headlong into folly with a rake.    The two sisters are then taken into London for a season, and the truth is known about both men on their lives.  One is already secretly engaged (entrapped is more like it)and the other has proposed to a wealthy woman because of his own bad debts.    Everything works out for the best and everyone gets what they deserve in the end.  Life doesn't always look like it works that way, but it probably does. At least this movie inspires me to believe it.    The music in it is outstanding along with all of the beautiful panoramic scenery of England's countryside.
B0000004V2|5.0|Highly influential was this Manchester band, the Stone Roses.   They only put two albums out in their whole 12 year career, but this one marked the Stone Roses as a very important Rock band who crafted a style that was all their own. Combining 60s guitar pop with dance beats and a bit of psychadelia. Very innovative, since no other band was doing this, with the possible exception of the Happy Mondays. Of course they were nowhere near as good.     The Stone Roses s/t debut is definitely an 80s classic. One of the best from the decade. Pure Brit/Pop that re-energised the movement.   A movement in which later inspired bands like Blur and Oasis. Still no one does it better than the Stone Roses! and their debut is pure gold.   To me, it sounds like this record is from a band who had a seasoned career, not just a first time effort as this. One of the best debut albums I have ever heard.   John Squire is a Master at the guitar, superior throughout, especially on the band's epic - \\"I Am the Ressurection\\" and \\"Fool's Gold\\" which isn't on my early used copy. The song was released on later editions and I first heard it on 'The Complete Stone Roses' album.   Every song on this Cd Rocks! Not a stinker on all of these 11 or 12 tracks depending on which version you have.  - \\"I Wanna Be Adored\\" - \\"She Bangs the Drums\\" - \\"Made Of Stone\\" & \\"This Is the One\\" are my highlights.   If you are a fan of Rock music or just music in general and you don't have this in your collection, What are you waiting for ? Buy it.
B00000G3AZ|4.0|The story may vary greatly from what the book was intended to express but I liked the premise of the movie. I have never read the book.  However, it doesn't matter.  The movie is what the movie is.       The poor little rich girl has nothing left to do after her governess gets married but to try to \\"repeat\\" her success at match making by hooking up the parson with a local girl.  The whole thing backfires miserably, and Emma nearly loses her true and best friend in the process.     There is so much in human nature and the nature of females during this time period that are still characteristic of women today. (Even though we have come a long way)  I think the screenplay writers thought that it would be better to express the more positive sides of busy bodies given from the male perspective.  Then one could understand the reasons why Mr. Knightly came to adore Emma.    The story was humorous and well written and the actors were all obviously selected to compliment one another. I loved Gwyenth Paltrow in this part and think she made an incredible character with or without any help from the \\"Emma\\" in Jane Austen's book.
B000002KCC|5.0|'Tonight's the Night' was one of my first Neil Young records and to this day it is the one I play the most.<br />It is filled with a lot of sadness, possibly Neil Young's most heartfelt work yet. Honestly the sadness shines through so purely that it makes me feel happier just listening to it.<br />I can really sense Neil Young's pain as he sings a song like \\"Tired Eyes\\" laid back and relaxing.<br /> A few years ago I played this album every night after first buying it. It just struck a certain chord with me unlike any other Cd/record I own.<br />So honest and real, the grief felt after losing a close friend. I, like many people can really relate to 'Tonight's The Night'.<br /> I can't count the number of times I sat down in the dark and drank 'til I could drink no more listening to the beauty that is Neil Young and this incredible record of 12 songs.<br /> Although I grew up mostly listening to 80s and 90s Rock bands, 'Tonight's the Night' remains one of the Top best albums I will ever own.<br />- A Record that really does help after losing a Loved one.
B00004TLN3|3.0|The photography was awful...the sound was hideous and off-beat for the time era! The costumes and scenery would have been out-of-this world had someone filmed it right! The Roman bath would have been something worth watching the movie to see...once again, if you could see it clearly! Why bother to film in an actual Roman bath and not get some good shots? Why use lovely costumes with cameras that fade out their colors?  That Abbey! What I wouldn't have given to see it on a clear screen!    If there is a newer version I would like to see it. Great storyline and great acting...just poor taste in production, or too tight of a budget. Unfortunately, this film left me wishing I could actually see a movie like this.  How could anyone take this combination of beauty and muck it up this bad?    Okay, the protagonist was a little goofy looking, but, wasn't she supposed to be? Jane Austen described her as pretty, but not so smart.

006056251X|4.0|This is one of the best books I've read in a long time.  At least the first third of the book is best of the best.  Their elopement had me rolling in the floor with some of his cutting quips.  Their repartee was priceless!  I loved it that he would say something absolutely hateful one moment and be tucking warm bricks under her feet the next.  I loved it that he would be saying outrageous things while calling her sweetheart, pet,  my love etc.  And when he moved on to bedroom talk.  Ooh la la!    But then the book slid downhill a bit for me.  I didn't care for the whole near death wound scenes.  I would have much rather seen them become close because he kicked her family into the back of beyond.  I wanted to hear him use that sarcastic wit on her family, not lie feverish in his bed.  He was too much man to be emasculated like that.      And I did find it strange that they would be accepted in society with him running the gambling club.  Titled gentlemen are not allowed to work or be involved in any kind of trade.  It's just not done.    Flaws and all still a keeper.  I loved Evie and St. Vincent both, they make a great couple.
B00005JPQT|4.0|After having temporarily staved off a vicious assault, Justin Long's character shakily asks his savior if he's done stuff like that before and if he's killed someone before, to which John McClane's laconic response is \\"Not for a long time.\\" And, indeed, it's been 12 long years since DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE. John McClane is now older, balder, grumpier, and, saddled with a PG-13 rating, not as profane, but he still cannot stay out of trouble. This time, he's assigned the seemingly mundane task of escorting in young hacker Matt Farrell (Justin Long), who's wanted for questioning. But the situation quickly sours as, within moments of meeting Farrell, McClane begins to hear that oh-so-familiar melody of automatic gunfire directed at their noggins.<br /><br />Both McClane and the frail but side-of-the-mouth funny computer geek speedily realize that Farrell's fringe involvement is merely the very tip of the iceberg, and that the stakes are much, much higher. Turns out that the contractor who'd hired Farrell to do a simple, innocuous code work is scheming to hold the entire nation hostage with his own paralyzing brand of cyber terrorism. Soon, the systematical shutdown of the American infrastructure is underway as, basically, all things computerized become compromised. This includes the targeting and usurping of key establishments such as the FAA, Amtrak, the stock market, and our satellite communications system. But, for Los Angelinos like myself, the most insiduous act commited may have been the subversing of *gasp* the street traffic lights.<br /><br />For the now grizzled John McClane, nothing much has changed. He's a Lieutenant Detective now, so he's kind of moved up in the world. And he still has those perpetually pursed lips. But his personal life is predictably very much of a mess. He's alone again, divorced (with his ex-wife Holly gone back to using her Gennero surname) and estranged from his children. The start of the film has McClane pathetically attempting to keep tabs on his wilful and sullen daughter, Lucy Gennero (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). But she wants none of his reconciliatory gestures. Not to mention, McClane's an anachronistic type who clings to classic rock music and who is computer unsavvy. Good thing he's got a hacker in his custody.<br /><br />It's such a treat to watch Bruce Willis again be in his element and playing this iconic role. Not that Entertainment Weekly has the final say, but I do agree with the magazine's listed assessment of [[ASIN:B0002B15WE Die Hard (Widescreen Edition)]] as being the top action film ever (ALIENS was number 2, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK was number 3). Nowadays, Willis, at 52 years old, is not as spry or free with the smirks. But his physicality, even at this stage, can't be questioned as he suffered bruises and scars in the making of this film. As McClane, he still trounces bad guys with the best of 'em. But, more so than McClane's penchant for arse whoopin', what draws the audience to him is that aura of reluctance, world weariness, and doggedness which he exudes so naturally. We relate to this ordinary, blue collar cat who, time and again, becomes stuck in the wrong place at the wrong time and is forced to angrily muddle thru because there's no one else to do the job. Although LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD portrays McClane as more of a supercop this time, who can go one on one with an F-35 fighter jet and murder an assault chopper with a car, I still fondly remember the first film, in which McClane passed muster as a very likable everyday guy barely keeping it together in Nakatomi Plaza. John McClane has built up so much good will that I'm able to easily forgive - and even celebrate - the high octane and wildly improbable excesses here.<br /><br />Justin Long, dubiously best known as the Mac guy in the Apple computer ad campaigns, gets his number called for sidekick duties, and he does a good job, although there were times where his trembly act got to be too much. His Matt Farrell maybe a borderline computer felon but his heart's in the right place. Long gets to make the brunt of the wisecracks while McClane tersely motors along (he says to some fellow geeks who'd just blown his cover, \\"Good luck at the Bad Timing Awards.\\"). One failing of the film is the lack of a charismatic villain. Timothy Olyphant is unmemorable as former Homeland Security computer whiz Thomas Gabriel, whose mission is to digitally teach the nation and his ex-bosses a lesson while garnering sinful financial amounts. There's nothing fresh or arresting about Olyphant's acting performance, which basically consists of a whole lot of staring really hard. But, admittedly, it's fun to witness Gabriel's ever growing exasperation as McClane persists in surviving. Maggie Q does better as the evil hot Asian babe who's also a formidable martial artist. Her character Mai proves to be pretty resilient (but, ultimately, not resilient enough). Writer and maverick director Kevin Smith gets a chance to mug for the camera as the Warlock (or Freddy, to his mom), a jedi hacker whose base of operations is in his mother's basement. Bonnie Bedelia, by the way, is sorely missed, and the film would've benefited with more scenes between McClain and his surly daughter.<br /><br />LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD is primed to be a colossal summer blockbuster, and, as such, it has certain criteria it has to meet. Director Len Wiseman (the UNDERWORLD films) comes strong and full bore with great visuals, a relentless pace, implausible action sequences, and crazy pyrotechnics. And all this performed at raucous, senses shattering decibels. The stunts are mindblowing, keeping in mind that CG effects were kept to a minimum. These are flesh and bone stunts being done here. But, still, at the heart of the loud thrill-a-minutes, there is Bruce Willis keeping it all together with his signature McClane-isms. I still get a vast kick out of his un-PC chortling whenever he causes yet another bad guy's demise (oh, that poor, agile-as-a-monkey French dude). As always, to me, his mockery of death, in a way, adds a layer of realism as this has become McClane's way of ackowledging his vulnerability and celebrating his surviving yet another harrowing scrape. LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD is PG-13, but the film finds ways to circumvent the rating as the ever resourceful McClane continues to cuss (but minus the \\"F\\" word) and ad-lib his way to amassing an impressive body count.

0618680004|1.0|Dawkins is a hypocrite for writing with such disdain about fundamentalists, when he is just as hardcore in his advocacy of fundamentalist atheism as anyone else ever has been with their ideas of religion.     The man is a scientific giant, and with one of the finest minds on the planet is over-qualified to write about evolutionary biology, his specialist field. But spiritually he is dwarfed by a peanut, and so one wonders exactly what qualifications he claims in this department. Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player to have ever lived, but does that qualify him to write an insultingly authoritative book on, say, the stock market?        \\"Until such point as a man has strived to elevate himself above his material existence, God shall remain forever invisible to him.\\"       Dawkins, as fine an academic mind as he possesses, has only ever become master of a materialistic universe, and is no more spiritually aware than a gnat.     With what authority does he talk about matters of God?
0802714544|5.0|Leamas is waiting for an agent.  His cover has been blown.  Alec Leamas and the agent, Karl, have already had a row over a woman.  The white searchlight goes on as Karl is crossing on his bike.  Leamas wants operational assignments.  He knows now he has been written off.  Leamas's counterpart is Mundt.  Leamas has been losing agents, Control reminds him.  Under him there has been a heavy rate of expenditure, a lot of dead agents.  Control believes the Circus should try to get rid of Mundt.  Leamas is to ferret out George Smiley.  He knows the case well.  Within a few months Leamas becomes a resentful drunken wreck.  Killing Mundt is to be Leamas's last act; afterwards he can come in from the cold.      In terms of quality this is not ordinary popular fiction, this is extraordinary.  The author writes in a subdued and steely fashion, powerfully. Subsequently Leamas becomes a defector.  Peters is to question him at a location in Holland.  Leamas learns he is wanted in London for an offense under the Official Secrets Act.  Liz Gold is a friend of Alec.  She is visited by Special Branch.  There is a connection between Alec Leamas and George Smiley, a card.  Peters, a Russian, delivers Leamas to East Germany.      Layers of deception, not surprisingly, constitute the story.  Journalists and lawyers are inquisitive.  Questions become ends in themselves.  Leamas is asked about his philosophy.  Having completed his first stage as a defector he is to be put on ice.   Much of the appeal of mystery stories is psychological description.  LeCarre, former member of the secret service and son of a confidence man, is in a premier position to create a full range of psychological types and permutations generated by acts.

B0000028M7|5.0|Alice in Chains is to this day one of the most creative bands of all time and this album is the best way to be introduced to their music because not only is it their masterpiece, but it is the best representation of their music in every way. AIC makes dark, depressing, and creepy music and no other band has ever been able to capture these moods like this band has. It seems that it comes naturally to AIC because they convey these emotions through their songs so perfectly but effortlessly. Jerry Cantrell's spooky guitar playing and backing vocals and Layne Staley's chilling and powerful vocals are the most perfect match music as a whole has ever seen, and is the reason AIC was so perfect and unique in their songs. Their first album was more upbeat and fast-paced while their third and final studio album was extremely slow-paced and almost too creepy. This album, however, is AIC at their prime and contains their best songs including Down in a Hole, Rooster, and their greatest song, Would?. Every time I listen to that song I can't believe how great it is along with the band that made it.
0887307280|5.0|\\"The e-Myth Revisited\\" is an entertaining, well-written book that provides Gerber's philosophy on why 80% of small businesses fail and what can be done to prevent that.    It is presented in three parts. Part I serves to convince the reader that just because they are a great technician, it does not mean they will be a great owner of a business that does technical work. In essence, every small business must either grow or die, and for the owner, \\"your job is to prepare yourself and your business for growth\\" not necessarily work in the business.    Part II seeks to convince the reader that the business Business Format Franchise is the optimal model for a small business. With this concept, the product of the business is the business itself, and the owner should build his business as if he will franchise it.    Part III gets down to some blocking and tackling of founding and constructing the business. This is an excellent little section that communicates a lot in a short space about operational, management, and marketing strategies. The questions raised in sections \\"Your Primary Aim\\" and \\"Your Strategic Objectives\\" are worth posing when considering any vocation, not just running a small businesses. The concept of \\"The Game\\" is very insightful, and it is applicable to both small business and corporate managers.     This isn't your typical business advice book. A consulting session with Sarah, owner of All About Pies, runs through the text, providing a forum for Gerber to give his advice in a personal fashion (and to exhibit an apparent flare for drama). The pages are sprinkled with references to classical literature, and there is a mid-book confession Gerber's exotic lifestyle, career choices and the road he took to become who he is now. And then there is Gerber's philosophical approach:    - He says \\"Your business is nothing more than a distinct reflection of who you are\\".     - He states small business has a higher calling than just business, and provides a Game to address the \\"Something is missing in most of our lives.... Part of what's missing is purpose. Values. Worthwhile standards against which our lives can be measured. Part of what's missing is a Game Worth Playing.\\" Elsewhere, he says \\"A small business is a place that responds instantly to any action we take. A place where we can practice implementing ideas in a way that changes lives.\\"    - He compares a small business to a dojo, or our practice hall, to wrestle with ourselves outside our comfort zone.     - He advises us to be wary of the comfort zone, saying \\"Your Comfort Zone has seized you before... and it can seize you again, when you're least prepared for it, because it knows what it means to you. Because it knows how much you want to be comfortable. Because it knows what price you are willing to pay for the comfort of being in control. The ultimate price, your life.... Comfort makes cowards of us all.\\"    As far as the intended audience, in the first line of his Introduction, Gerber states \\"If you own a small business, or if you want to own a small business, this book was written for you\\". This is very true, with two caveats: it offers little insight on how to determine what type of business to start, and secondly, there are nuggets of wisdom in here for corporate mid-level or line managers too.    Although I was slightly put-off by long-winded digressions and melodrama, I still have to strongly recommend \\"The E-Myth\\" to its target audience.
B000ANVQ0K|4.0|I have mixed feelings about this film.  It has great moments, a genuinely tragic true story, really lame dialogue, an unbelievable sentimental (though effective) \\"romance\\", and there are some factual errors in the film (which is not good considering James Cameron bragged about its authenticity).  Yet, this film is remarkable in so many ways.<br /><br />Titanic, by all accounts, should have been a box office disaster.  It has many things that the \\"experts\\" say will kill your film.  First, it's 194 minutes long.  Second, it has no stars (Leo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet were not big stars when this was released).  Third, it's depressing (the boat sinks...SPOILER).  Fourth, it's predictable (the boat sinks...it's a true story).  Fifth, it was a troubled production that had its release date postponed due to cost overruns.  Yet, it is the biggest box office hit of all time.  The look of the film is sumptuous, with great production design, gorgeous cinematography, and excellent acting (for the most part).  Tecnhincally, the film is flawless (Cameron is known for his technological prowess).  As much as I like DiCaprio, I think he's a bit uncomfortable playing a role like this, but he is still believable.  Winslet is superb.  One of the best things about the film is how Cameron contrasts the upper deck snobs with the lower deck \\"lower classes\\", and how the lower classes are much more human and real than the snotty upper classes are.  Themes like that were not in great abundance in the 1990's.  There are moments of pure poetry and sadness, especially with the musicians playing on board as the boat goes down.<br /><br />However, the romance between Winslet and DiCaprio is hokey and detracts from the film a bit.  The film also makes a glaring omission that there was a nearby ship that ignored the flares and the calls from the Titanic.  I found this out in the film A Night to Remember, which was far more meticulous about the actual sinking and the reasons behind it.  This film was more about the romance between Winslet and DiCaprio.  There is an awful lot of really bad dialogue here, which also detracts.  Interestingly enough, the only main categories this film didn't get nominated in was screenplay (which Cameron, rather pigheadedly, complained about), and best actor (which DiCaprio didn't show up at the Oscars, which caused some controversy, unwarranted in my opinion).<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a pretty good film that should be seen.  James Cameron made a film that defied all expectations, and won a bunch of Oscars for it.  As of this writing, he is working on a new feature film called Avatar, but he didn't direct for almost 10 years after this film.  This film took a lot out of him, like Fitzcarraldo and Apocalypse Now did out of Herzog and Coppola (although those films are superior to Titanic).the romance between Winslet and DiCaprio.

B000002NBY|5.0|I've read most of the reviews and while I'm delighted this album is almost universally rated at (or above) 5 stars, I'm disappointed to read \\"one of the best,\\" \\"possibly one of the best,\\" \\"best album of the '80s,\\" etc. in the descriptions. C'mon folks. How can you hedge your accolades that way for this disc? Somewhere there must be an album that is \\"THE best\\" with no wiggle room. Can't you commit to that? I can. Graceland is THE BEST. Period. (Just so you know, Sgt. Pepper is #2)    I love the reviewer who tells you to listen to the record and if you don't like it get someone to slap you. That's it. That encapsulates how good this album is. Or the two or three who call it their \\"desert island\\" CD. That says it all. And I am absolutely of the same opinion as those who proclaim, \\"there are no bad cuts--listen to it from beginning to end.\\" I said that about this album 20 years ago and after listening to it again last night (all the way through) can confirm the truth of that statement.    I just watched the PBS special of Paul Simon's Gershwin Award. Of his entire body of work that was being celebrated, guess which album was best represented? By an incredible margin. They performed almost every song. That tells you all you need to know.    Get this album. Steal it, if you have to. I only ask that you play it once. I'll never have to ask you again.
B0007TKNL0|2.0|Although I have never seen the stage production, I do own a soundtrack of the original cast.  I must say this pales in comparison.  The two largest problems with this is that Emmy Rossum can sing but not act and Gerard Butler can act but not sing.  Hardly a recipe for something wonderful.  Rossum goes through the movie with two expressions, open-mouthed horror and open-mouthed awe.  Butler, while he can keep pitch, does nothing close to justice to the incredible songs he has to sing.  The actor of Raoul was fairly disappointing as well, not being what one would imagine a young dashing hero to be.  The scene of him arriving on a white horse was especially cliched.  It didn't help that the fight that follows was pretty unexciting.  That being said, it is a gorgeous looking movie.  The sets and costumes are incredible and actually seeing what is happening does clarify some things on the soundtrack.  I was let down by the masquerade ball however.  Having everyone in black and white didn't make any sense, especially in contrast to the lyric's description of the ball itself.  The Phantom in red could still have been stunning without the rest of the costumes being so drab.  All in all I was disappointed.  They certainly could have picked better actors/singers to play the leads.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|The CW has got to be the most pathetic TV network (next to FOX, where it seems no shows last any longer than 2 years, but we get TWO NIGHTS of AMERICAN IDIOT, I mean, IDOL!!, yet great shows on FOX such as Tru Calling, Dark Angel and Firefly bit the dust far too soon).     The CW killed their best show, Veronica Mars, by halting it's third season by showing America a generic RockStar/American Dufus(oops!Idol) televised search for...THE NEXT PUSSYCAT DOLL????!!!     When this happened, I was like, This is TRULY the end of new quality TV being aired.     Veronica Mars was a breath of fresh air to the TV airwaves after losing BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER and ANGEL (yet another show that was patheticly cancelled by the CW's former, WB, way too soon).  Veronica Mars had great, young actors, clever dialogue and involved great twists and turns with it's crime solving/mystery story-telling..But, then again, maybe that's why the show didn't last: IT TOLD STORIES and INVOLVED ACTING!!! Unlike the irrational forms of \\"entertainment\\" fodder that, sadly, too many americans swallow and think they are getting quality TV..     The only show that is worth watching on the CW now is SUPERNATURAL (Some of you may say what about SMALLVILLE? Sorry, that kid who plays Clark Kent just isn't believable as the boy of still, I mean steel, my opinion).  Let's hope SUPERNATURAL won't get the Third Season axe like Veronica Mars with the CW pre-empting the show with the likes of Searching for the new Boy Band!    Glad there are the Discovery and Sci Fi Channels...

0385340540|3.0|I give this a middle rating because of two factors.  First, this book was a very enjoyable summer read, that kept me entertained, even while stuck in an airplane on a runway for 3+ hours.  As other reviews detail the synopsis (and unbelieveability - which the author himself admits in the Afterward) I will not go into that.  But like any chase thriller, this has all the components that make it fun.<br />  Second, is a bigger problem, and pet peeve of mine.  Lately more and more authors (including Patterson, and others) have decided to write two-parters (or more) but do not indicate this.  Now I do not know if the Broker will have a sequel, but it is totally set up for that with MANY plot points unresoved....a possible romance in the wings, danger lurking for many characters, and a deadly Chinese assasin team still \\"out there.\\"  I was soooo enjoying this story and then I discovered I was down to about 20 pages and I thought \\"Oh, know...another part 1,\\" and I was right...or the author gave up on trying to find an ending.  The bigger problem with this is that IF there is a sequel, authors usually spend a lot of time going over plot points from the first book, so the reader who shells out more $$$ for part 2 only gets a little bit of a \\"new\\" plot.<br />  I write this to forwarn you.  If you like Grisham you will probably, as I did, enjoy this book, but know going in that there will be a lot of loose ends left untied.

B00005JPFC|5.0|'Ratatouille' brings a distinctively different animated menu.  Straight from Pixar/Disney entertainment, we get a fun, freewheeling adventure that is always witty, fresh, and funny.    Our hero is Remy (Patton Oswalt) a rat with a lot on his plate.  Survival is his family's primary purpose in life, but Remy doesn't want just to survive, he wants to live.  Having a particularly astute olfactory sense, he disdains the garbage dump for a tastier venue.  When he and his community are evicted from their peasant woman's place, it's a narrow escape at best. Remy is separated from the rest, so he ventures off to see the sights of Paris.  There he happens upon Gusteau's 5-star restaurant, a place where the owner inspires everyone, \\"That anyone can cook\\".  Gusteau dies of heartache after his place is demoted to 4-star status by critic nemesis Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole) known as \\"The Grim Eater\\".  Once inside he keeps a low-profile until he comes upon newly hired hand Linguini (Lou Romano) who hands his letter of recommendation from Gusteau's widow to Skinner, the manager.  Skinner is a low-down greedy type who lends the Gusteau name to less haute frozen food cuisine.  In his repertoire are recipes for sabotage and a detective to find Linguini's true heritage to prevent him becoming the restaurant's heir.  Reme' elevates Linguini's cuisine skills with distinctive communication they keep under his hat.  Besides a hostile critic and manager, Linguini faces Collette, a beautiful fellow cook who must bear all the talent but none of the stature of men.    'Ratatouille' is thoroughly delightful.  The plot is seasoned with imaginative ingredients that never falter for entertainment.  The peril is creative, and the story is marinated to perfection.  With such a clever and witty script (written by five writers, no less) the pace and execution is suitable for every palate.  It is hard to imagine a better family entertainment for 2007.

B00006ZXSK|5.0|This is the kind of movie you will watch over and over again with your daughter or your grandchildren (or by yourself on a day you need some cheering up). A time-honored story, beautifully done, and updated just enough--but not contemporized (thank goodness).
B0000025T6|5.0|I've been putting off buying this album on CD until Columbia remastered it. However I was in Best Buy today and picked a copy of it up because the cover caught my eye. No longer was there the old Compact Disc logo down on the bottom corner of the cover, nor does the back state \\"Due to limitations of the Source...\\" that all the old Columbia cd's have. The spine of the cover also is not the white with red letters. It is black with small dark red print. In short, it seems that this was a re-issue, though nowhere on it does it say Remastered. I bought it and the CD itself has the vinatge Columbia logo that all the new remasters seem to sport. Reading through the booklet (another improvement over the previous CD) I found it states who produced the album originally but says nothing about a remastering. So, I can only assume that Columbia has updated its packaging but for whatever reason hasnt done anything with the sound. Surprising, considering what they've done with Bob Dylans catalog and even Leonard Cohens. You think there would be a demand for improved sound quality for an artist of his stature. Too bad...
B00005JPAO|5.0|Love Helen Mirren, (and loved her as a younger Elizabeth I in the HBO 2-part series as well, look for it!)and all the cast is excellent as well. But after reading Tina Brown's Chronicles of Diana and YES I know its' a rehash of what we all \\"know\\" of those years and that particular soap opera, but the last chapters of the book after Diana's death, are fascinating in that they are the same time period shown in \\"the Queen\\". According to people who were there, servants, officials and the like, the emotional sense of how the family reacted toward the young princes, William and Harry, has none of the coldness and emotional \\"lets just get on with life\\" attitude implied in the film and in the review, top, which says \\"Prince Phillip clumsily tried to help by taking the boys hunting.\\" (paraphrased).  Well, these boys had spent their summer vacations riding and hunting at Balmoral all their lives, and this is what they thoroughly enjoyed. It wasn't something their stuffy old grandfather forced them to do. The book describes the entire Royal family rallying around the boys---Princess Anne, Charles' sister, brought her 20 yr old son and 16 yr old daughter, to help entertain their cousins, and she herself made a project of taking the very emotionally fragile Harry under her wing, and taking him riding and hiking out in the Balmoral hills alone. Charles pulled out family albums and spent time going over the past good times the family had had. Prince Phillip their grandfather, in particular, was very protective, showed \\"gruff tenderness\\" and did make sure they hunted,rode and kept active, as opposed to brooding and staying glued to the maudlin TV coverage. Actually, for the benefit of the boys, the Queen ordered all TVs and radios removed in the castle.  The outdoors life is one the family is used to and enjoys. Those who criticised the Royals for having the boys there in Balmoral instead of exposing them to the hysterical crowds in London...well, I don't know which would give them more nightmares in years to come but I can guess.  Also, other little tidbits in the book of that week were once when Prince Phillip came on the intercom when the decisions about the State funeral were being made and broke in, shouting, \\"those boys have just lost their mother...they are not a commodity...\\" Brown, the author quotes her source as saying \\"you could hear the voice of a real grandfather.\\" Later, it was Prince Phillip, not Charles who talked the princes into walking in the moving spectacle of the royal men behind the cortege. He told the sobbing William, \\"If I walk, will you walk with me?\\" And during the long walk to the Cathedral, spoke quietly to the two boys of the famous sights they were passing, speaking softly the whole way there. All these vignettes, which would have made all the Royal more human, were left out of the film, good as it was, there was an agenda, that doesn't have to be spelled out.  The Queen could admire a royal appearing stag, later shown beheaded...but her love and her husband's love for the grandsons was never shown, nor was the love of the whole family for the boys or for each other, despite all Diana had done to blacken the reputation of that family in the press. Not that they're perfect, just human.more nightmares in years to come but I can guess.

B000OCXMAE|1.0|How do you say someones latest effort really stinks politely? Like most of you I was an avid fan of Linkin Park. Played thier CD`s so much I had to buy them over and over again because I`d wear out the CD. This latest Cd from linkin park is as good as trash to me. Why change the sound of the music when everyone LOVED the sound they already had? I understand the band wanted to change the way they expressed themselves through thier music. Ok. Instead of just changing a little bit of thier sound and lyrics, they changed the ENTIRE sound, lyrics, mood, vibe, passion, all that we all came to adore and enjoy about Linkin Park. With this \\" Minutes to Midnight \\" CD, I have to say I`m strongly disappointed and if they dont go back to being the band we all could jam and have a good time listening to, then Linkin Park is in for a rude awakening.
B000MGUZM0|5.0|I never write reviews for record these days... I don't know, but I never get emotional enough to do so.  It was absolutely different with this record. I feel the urge to recommend it to everyone I know.  Simply put, it is excellent. The songs and the lyrics are excellent. And the interpretation as well. The band really makes you FEEL with these songs.  I don't think I'll listen to a better record this year.
B000002UAO|5.0|(4.5 stars, actually)<br /><br />This album, which marks the beginning of The Beatles' middle period, is often cited as one of the first real albums. Prior to this, just about all albums consisted of a couple of big hits padded out with a lot of filler designed to boost sales for the popular singles on it. But here we have something which was consciously made as an album as opposed to just a haphazard collection of songs thrown together in no particular or special order. And although this album might not quite be up to their highest artistic level yet, there's no denying these songs show a huge maturity and step up from the type of pop they'd been doing for the past few years. Heavily influenced by pot and folk rock, this album paints a picture of a band whose transitional period from pop songs to more serious and mature recordings was pretty much over, with no going back.<br /><br />I'm rather amused at all of the people who insist that this isn't the \\"real\\" RS but \\"only\\" the British version. The British version IS the real RS! From what I've heard, the American repackaging from Capitol probably did have a more consistently folksy feel, but it still wasn't the album The Beatles worked hard on making and meant for their fans to hear! As a second-generation Beatlemaniac, this, the genuine original untampered with version, is the one I'm familiar with; it would feel just as wrong to me to hear it starting with \\"I've Just Seen a Face\\" as it might for some nostalgic aging Boomer to hear it starting with \\"Drive My Car.\\" And though there are a few songs not quite up to the overall level of quality (most particularly the junky closing number \\"Run for Your Life\\"), this album is pretty much near-perfect. The songs don't belong any other way. Although at least Capitol recognised how different and special this album was, and thus didn't do as much tampering as they usually did, and even retained the original title and cover.<br /><br />Overall, this is a wonderful album to get mellowed out to, and a real snapshot in time, of that brief period when The Beatles had matured beyond cover songs and pop songs into more mature and serious artists, yet before they became as heavy and experimental as they did as the decade wore on. The songs range from soft slow songs like \\"In My Life\\" and \\"Michelle,\\" to lighter poppier fare such as \\"You Won't See Me\\" and \\"Drive My Car,\\" to rather deep and introspective songs such as \\"Girl\\" and \\"Think for Yourself,\\" and everything in between. Probably the only major flaw with it is that it has to end with such a throwaway as \\"Run for Your Life.\\" While not every song on even a great album has to be a winner, it just seems wrong for one of the weakest tracks to be placed at the very end, which kind of disrupts the nice folksy mood that had been set.real snapshot in time, of that brief period when The Beatles had matured beyond cover songs and pop songs into more mature and serious artists, yet before they became as heavy and experimental as they did as the decade wore on.

B000M5B6Q0|5.0|I rented the Music and Lyrics movie expecting to go through the same emotions I experience when watching any romantic comedy.  And as I expected, I watched with a silly smile on my face, there were moments I yelled at the TV, I bopped to the music, I laughed, and I cried, and I was totally charmed.  But I am seldom so dazzled by a film's soundtrack to literally rush out and buy a copy!!  The lyrics are catchy and refreshing, the songs are upbeat and fun, and they all mesh together perfectly.  This is a soundtrack I will be listening to all summer long, and well after summer is over.

B00005JPLW|5.0|Ok, so let's start with what should really be obvious.  If you are looking to learn the Details for a Historical Event, pick up a book.  What has happened that EVERY single movie has to be 100 percent historically accurate? What happened to the magic of movies?  Don't we immerse ourselves in movies to be entertained?  While 300 is by no means a historical account of the epic battle of Persians v Greeks, it is great fun!  It is without a doubt the most violent (yet oddly the most beautiful) movie I have ever seen. I settled in and was spellbound by this movie.  I loved every gory vibrant scene.  So, if you want history pick up a book and do some research, don't lay around and expect the big (or small) screen to spoon feed you everything.  See the movie for the visual splendor and engaging story.  Remember the key to ALL movies SUSPEND DISBELIEF!
1400063515|3.0|Probable events occupy our minds.  Improbable events (black swans) are oft-ignored, yet can have huge impacts on all of our lives.  That is the insight of this book.  Hardly seems worth an entire book, unless the black swans are coming to get you, and me, and thee.  Then it might be worth a read.<br /><br />Statistical improbability is clear: the needle differs from the haystack.  A big event can be rare and widespread -- think of a tsunami, a market crash.  By their very nature, these events are not factored in, as we go about planning our daily lives.<br /><br />This book argues that this aspect of human nature is a form of ignorance.  That these rare events occur in a quite regular fashion, a few each generation, and more are coming, as our society grows in complexity and unpredictability.<br /><br />Therefore, if we accept the idea of a black swan, we can calculate strategies, hedges, which protect against them.  If one bad hurricane hits your hometown every thirty years, then at age 30 you need to buy hurricane shutters.<br /><br />In that this insight should inform investors, Presidents, home builders, and insurance agents, this book is valuable.  Rather than relying on our gut instincts, we need to seek the counter-intuitive.  In that the author tries to be folksy and is instead sort of smug (his snide aside on Bergson for example) and sort of irritatingly repetitive, a reader will begin to wish this was a long New Republic article instead of a book.<br /><br />(As a final comment, a reader begins to slowly sense that the author is not adequately representing the statistical sciences, and their take on the unlikely.  There is a sense that what is being attacked is statistics 101, and maybe statistics 301, and not anything more complex than that... almost as though his insights must be claimed as unique in order to validate his book sales strategy, and that perhaps a few counter-texts are being over-looked here?  That wouldn't be too improbable now, would it...).)
1416914285|4.0|This novel was definately action packed. What would you expect with a story full of Vampires, Werewolves, Demons and Shadowhunters? The methods of Demon slaughter are intriguing and high tech. The idea of the fallen angel is unconventional, but still extremely well done. The twist in the plot left my mouth hanging open for over twenty pages. Why did he have to take him? Why? It was intense and I loved it.    I can easily relate to Clary--our heroine. To love a best friend or fall in love with a ruggedly handsome demon slayer? That is the question. Though the romance is an undertone to the shadowhunting it adds just the right touch to the empassioned demon hunting.     I really enjoyed this book and am eagerly awaiting the second--the cover is phenominal by the way. I would recommend this to anyone.
0061142026|5.0|\\"There was once a young man who wished to gain his Heart's Desire. And while that is, as beginnings go, not entirely novel (for every tale about every young man that ever was or will be could start in a similar manner) there was much about this young man and what happened to him that was unusual, although even he never knew the whole of it.\\"<br /><br />And so opens the beginning of this beautiful tale. At the turn of the Victorian era, in the English countryside, there was a town called Wall. It was named as such for the stone wall that was built to divide the city from the land of Faerie. Once every 9 years, a magical fair took place in the meadow outside Wall. It was the only time people were allowed outside the gap.<br /><br />Young Tristran Thorn wanted only one thing. He wanted the love of the beautiful, but rather shallow, Victoria Forrester. As he was walking her home one night, they saw a falling star. Tristran told Victoria he would bring her that star if she gave him his \\"heart's desire\\". And Victoria, thinking how foolish Tristran was, agreed.<br /><br />So with a pack on his back, Tristran sets off in the land of Faerie looking for the star. But he is not the only one looking. The witches of Lilim need the heart of the star to regain their youth. And the Lords of Stronghold are looking for the star in hopes of gaining the right to rule the land of Stronghold.<br /><br />This book is magical. Set in the land of faerie, we encounter unicorns and talking trees; witches and goblins; pixies and stars. Stardust is beautiful in it's simplicity and it's lyrical prose. I can't believe I waited so long to read it! The characters are unique and full of life. They were written with such a vividness that I can picture each and every one. If you haven't read this wonderful little fairy tale, you should. It will have you believing in magic and happily ever afters again!
B000QUEQBS|4.0|Shooter to date is by far the most underrated movie of 2007. Do you want a movie with action? How about suspense? Thrills? Shooter has it all.<br /><br />The acting is great and the direction is terrific. The plot is spotted with a few stretches of the imagination, but ultimately Shooter holds up well against some death-defying encounters and a sensational government conspiracy.<br /><br />Based on Stephen Hunter's 1993 novel Point of Impact [[ASIN:0553563513 Point of Impact]] , Shooter is the story of Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg, aka, good vibrating Marky Mark [[ASIN:B000001Y5A Music for the People]] ). In Hunter's novel Swagger was a legendary sniper in the Vietnam War. In Shooter we get the 2007 version of Swagger fresh out of conflict in Africa.<br /><br />After the FBI receives a sniper's threat against the President of the United States, Swagger is asked by the FBI to come out of retirement to help prevent the imminent threat. But the tables quickly turn on Swagger when he ends up as the accused assassin. And Swagger goes to war ala Rambo against all that betrayed him.<br /><br />In unexpected role reversals, Danny Glover and Ned Beatty are not in the typical teddy bear roles that they are normally cast, but they do their thing well under the direction of Antoine Fuqua who had success in 2001 with Training Day [[ASIN:B00005JKED Training Day]] .<br /><br />Shooter gets a bit politically one-sided at times, but otherwise the entertainment factor outweighs the political bias. I'd highly recommend Shooter to action fans.
1594489505|4.0|Hosseini is a gifted writer and this book is just as beautifully written as \\"The Kite Runner.\\" Both books have love and redemption as two of their themes; however, with this second novel Hosseini keeps us waiting and waiting for the redemption to occur -- and it takes so long.    Miriam finds her redemption by saving the life of Laila and by giving up her own with such dignity.  Laila's redemption is more complex, but I think she finds it in being an extraordinary mother and a loving wife when she is finally given the opportunity.    There is no redemption for Rasheed, the husband these two women share, who is presented as an utterly evil, self possessed scumbag. And yet, you can't help but think he could have been a more complex and interesting character than the one that comes across in the book.  Therein lies my only real criticism of the book, and the reason I gave it four stars instead of five. The male characters are not nearly as well developed as the female characters.  In that regard, it reminds me of \\"Steel Magnolias.\\"    \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" is a very sad book.  In a way, I found it to be even a bit depressing. And yet I couldn't put it down.  At the end of the day, the story of these two women, each very strong but in different ways, is so compelling that you just have to see how it turns out.  They really do form an amazing bond against a backdrop of world events that, unfortunately, American readers are not as familiar with as they should be.
B00005Q66Y|5.0|This is simply as good as it gets. Outclasses the fine Karajan of 20 years ago easily, and the BPO play as only they can. The one reviewer here who decries Wand and this recording is on a different planet, especially even mentioning the clueless Boulez in the same breath as this. Enough said!

0743454529|5.0|What would you do if you were faced with an upcoming death of your child?  Would you create a new living child to keep the other alive?  That's the story on this novel.  Cancer - that is the scary word that you know exists, but it surely will never knock at your door.  It only happens to others, right?  WRONG!  Cancer doesn't discriminate.  Here, parents were dealing with a deadly disease that their little daughter was facing......nothing would help her unless they could get a matching set of DNA to replace the bone marrow of their dying child.  So, they've created a new life.  They had a new baby daughter whose life is necessary to save the first daughter.  Is it ethical?  Is it right?  Who knows?  What would you do?  Don't judge!  If you love somebody - you'd most likely do anything that's possible.  But how much a little girl (new daughter) can take?  How many additional treatments, needles, hospital stays can she endure, before she'd have enough?  It's not her that's sick, yet she spends her fragile life more in hospital than any other child her age.  Is she loved?  Did her parents wanted her as a child?    This story is amazing...it's a tear breaker.  But more than tears, it brings many vital questions to surface.  It lets you see what a little \\"sister's keeper\\" goes through.....what she wants and dreams about.  I would definitely suggest this book to everyone but especially to those that have ever encounter a \\"cancer\\" in their lives, either through their own sickness or those that they loved.  It's a must!
B000MCH5P4|2.0|There are several different stories here only slightly related dealing with several different families in separate countries. Nothing that went into a whole. Some of the individual stories were touching. I particularly liked the Moroccan boys story. However overall it left me wondering what is the point of the story.     The acting is above average. Not surprising as it has some good actors. The filming is good.
0316010669|3.0|I can't say I was mesmerized by this book; however, it was an interesting read. What I found most interesting was the virtual wars between the Day Traders and the General Officers. In retrospect, had the Generals approached the virtual war games with open minds, instead of impenetrable egos, they may have been better equipped for the current war effort. Honestly, I think Blink allows most people an opportunity to flirt with the idea of intuition. In the end though, I think we're all simply a collection of personal experiences. And while some of those experiences prepare us for the unknown, some of them do not! And without those experiences, you may need more than simple intuition to reach a proper conclusion. While common sense goes a long way, and blinking may be fun, in the real world, I think it remains prudent to blink, but verify.
0143038419|5.0|This book is deep, delicious, and fun. It chronicles a woman's journey after her divorce. The divorce is not described in detail, but is clearly a protracted, difficult event. The author goes to Italy, where she learns Italian for the sheer joy of it, and eats as much gelato and other excellent food as she can. She goes on to India, where she meditates, though she had resisted this practice before and felt like she wasn't good at it. Then on to Indonesia, where she finds balance. This book is so well written. There are wonderful practices that the author undertakes (e.g., writing in a journal while very upset and then writing back to herself for comfort, having a ceremony alone in which she lets go of her former marriage and imagines herself being forgiven, and viewing Depression as a real life visitor who sneaks in but can also leave). Sometimes people find memoirs to be narcissistic or self-indulgent. This one is not. The author pokes fun at herself and is very real, human, and intensely likeable for all her imperfections. I recommend this book highly, what a pleasure to read.
0316010669|5.0|Highly recommended. This book is amazing- great research, and great life changing thought potential. I can't stop thinking about how this makes me think! Our brains are amazing, and this book shows us why.   Easy to read, wonderful insight.

B000OY8NII|5.0|There are lots of lengthy good reviews so I'll just say this is one of the few shows that interests me on tv.  It has great humor, a great premise and great characters.  The father-daughter relationship of the sheriff is wonderful, love the deputy, the wonderful chef at the cafe, pretty much all the characters.  The humor is intelligent, the stories are entertaining and interesting.  I really, really enjoy this show!  I was so excited to hear the 2nd season was starting.

0307237699|5.0|I'll leave politics aside during this review.  It isn't like we are going to change each other's minds.      I liked this book because the Senator appeared to be speaking from his heart instead of the standard political fluff; I think he actually believes what he writes.  I enjoyed the fact that he could admit that different points of view had merit.  I enjoyed the fact that right at the beginning he admitted that he had ideas, but no hard answers as to how to make our country better.  I liked his discussions, particularly his separation of values and religion.      I would recommend the book to anybody looking for eloquent political dialogue.  If you are looking for something to make your blood boil or leave you screaming, I think it would be best to look elsewhere.  The book is well written and passionate without the anger so prevalent in political dialogue today.  My only critism is the book is not as good as his first one...but that's my opinion only.
B000QFAJ7S|4.0|I love this album... No matter what happens in the future: Kelly Clarkson should be very happy with her body of work thus far.<br /><br />I have had the pleasure and the luck of seeing Kelly live, in concert more then once. Kelly is without a doubt one of the best singers of my generation.<br /><br />I really like the fact that you can hear each one of Kelly's individual influences on \\"My December\\". I can hear a little of Annie Lennox, a dash of Debbie Harry/Blondie and a bit of Aretha thrown in. Within all this, you can still hear Kelly Clarkson. Awesome!<br /><br />-L
1594489505|2.0|It was a good insight from a womens perspective. But this was a let down after the \\"Kite RUnner\\" It was boring at most. I kept skipping pages and wanting for the book to end not because it was good read but because I could not wait for this to be done and I can read a better book. It was not gripping, it did not make me read it word for word like the\\"Kite Runner\\". If you have not read this book yet don't feel like you are missing something. Wait for it in paperback or better yet borrow it from the library. it not worth the money.
B00021R7CG|5.0|I love this movie. It's World War III. And it's up to a few good men and women to try and stop this thing. You'll be paying attention every moment. Enjoy.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Wow, I knew Clinton Kelly had style - but I never knew he could act!<br /><br />Apparently using the stage name Daniel Craig, Clinton Kelly does an amazing job portraying 007.  He goes after criminals, plays amazing poker, and seduces the ladies with amazing suaveness - and, obviously, STYLE!  Never before has there been a more fashionable Bond.  Clinton/Daniel has raised the bar for all those to come after him.<br /><br />As Stacy would say:  SHUT UP!
B000OYC3J8|5.0|The gimmickry and false starts of Get Behind Me Satan (intermingled with a few really promising tracks, of course) have been far surpassed by this much stronger album.  After about eight listens, I am really happy with this release.  It's great!
B00006ZXSK|4.0|A new twist on \\"Cinderella.\\"  Drew Barrymore, a peasant servant, impersonates a Countess to plead for the freedom of an imprisoned servant bound for The Americas.  While winning his freedom she meets the Prince who is curious about her resolve and conscience.  He begs for her name, and the rest is an inriguing courtship.  The prince is tested throughout - is he good enough for her?-  and ultimately, do they live \\"Happily Ever After?\\"  Overall a great lesson for the kids about morality and justice and strength through adversity, and a fun romance for adults.  As a mom of four kids under thirteen, I highly recommend it.
B0006J28L4|5.0|This is a landmark in world film, and I recommend the two-disc DVD version for its special features and excellent, sharp transfer.<br /><br />Watching this finally made me understand why Malcolm X was the way he was.  It distinguished Malcolm X from the Nation of Islam quite clearly and showed the amazing transformation from his beginnings as a poisoned hoodlum to a clear-minded speaker for Elijah Muhammad to a spiritual, independent leader and voice for the true Islam.  Particularly effective is the sequence involving his pilgrimage to Mecca at the time of his separation from the Nation of Islam in 1964.  Brilliant filmmaking and editing.<br /><br />Visually, this is brilliant, thanks to some beautiful cinematography by Ernest Dickerson, and very true-to-life costume and stage design.<br /><br />The acting is solid throughout.  Denzel Washington obviously deserves the most credit for his seamless presentation of Malcolm X, both visually and verbally.  He became Malcolm.  Kudos as well to Delroy Lindo, Angela Bassett, Al Freeman for some equally solid performances.<br /><br />If I had to pick a criticism, it is that, the rhetoric in the film is very heavy-handed and forced at several points in the movie.  For example, the police captain who says (artificially), \\"That's too much power for one man to have\\", or the alleged speculation that the CIA was involved (wiretappers remarking in an aside, \\"compared to King, this guy's a lamb\\")-- maybe they were, but it didn't really add to the story in the way that they presented this subplot, or the attempt to try to put a happy ending on the film (kids standing up and shouting, \\"I am Malcolm X!\\") just didn't resonate well with me.  Minor points, but worth noting.<br /><br />In contrast, however, the opening sequence, although very heavy as well (with Malcolm's strong rhetoric superimposed over a burning American flag and the Rodney King police beating in LA) worked well as a powerful point of departure for the controversy and image of Malcolm X and a brilliant image of the history of race relations in America.<br /><br />Some claim that the movie's length is excessive.

B000000OA6|4.0|I think this was Freddie Mercury's last work. Sad to say. He was a showman, though, up to the end.
B000OYC3J8|4.0|Got this album in a package deal when preordering Ryan Adams' Easy Tiger.  I was really excited about Easy Tiger and figured, \\"Well the new WS album may be nice too.\\"  Until they arrived and I listened to them.  Easy Tiger was pleasant, harmonious . . . and dull.  Icky Thump is anything but dull.  The album starts with the title song that I can best describe as Zeppelin era Robert Plant rapping in full voice over modernized Black Sabbath (think War Pigs) riffs.  The songs after that keep up the pace of excitement, creativity, and adventurousness.  There are a couple more decent rockers, some hard blues, a song that sounds Spanish, a song that sounds Scottish, and one song, St. Andrew, that sounds like Scottish/Martian. All great though.  The only problem--the reason I can't give the album five stars--is that the bass drum is too loud on certain songs.  Way too loud on a couple.  Instead of providing a foundation for the songs (normal function for bass instruments) it breaks their flow.  Maybe this is part of WS experimental exploration or maybe, as some have suggested it is an unfortunate result of modern mastering or bad drumming.  Either way, I could do without it.  It is truly the icky thump on Icky Thump
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|It seems that it's been a long time coming for this album to come out, especially since Kelly had finished it by the beginning of this year. And with all the hulabaloo surrounding 'My December,' it seems very simple for America to forget about what truly matters-- the music.    This is an amazing album. A definite step up from the original idol, but it's not too far of a stretch from her past efforts as to completely ostracize her from the Top-40 genre (although radio certainly has). Undoubtedly the broodiest song on the entire album, \\"Never Again\\" sets the tone for the `My December' and is the perfect entryway into Miss Independent's current state of mind. We've all heard the song on the radio, and now we all know what awaits us as we continue to listen. Coming off of the anger and frustration train, \\"One Minute\\" provides a refreshing breath of funky, new-wave techno as Kelly laments about the madness of relationships.    In \\"Hole,\\" Kelly's voice is rockier than ever and the song is just another admission ticket into Kelly's inauguration as a full-fledged rocker. It's edgy and hard, but doesn't make you feel like you've somehow wronged Kelly in her quest for love, much like \\"Never Again\\" does. One of my favorite songs of the record, \\"Hole\\" is perfect for radio and air-guitarists everywhere. At this point, it seems time for a ballad, and \\"Sober\\" is the perfect one at that. In fact, it seems to me to be the perfect song. I first heard it when AOL posted a minute-long clip of it online, and I knew, even from the short snippet, that this song was going to be the one to solidify this album as Kelly's magnum opus (so far, anyway). There is no pretense here. Kelly's voice is raw and pure, and you can truly experience the emotions she's feeling as she sings.    Other songs are standout, as well, and thoroughly display Miss Clarkson's versatile singing range. Kelly's voice is smooth and silky on the mellow \\"Be Still,\\" a song that has been compared to those of Christine McVie (whom I had to YouTube in order to make any sort of a correlation). It's a nice break from the edginess of all the songs prior to this one, and Kelly's voice is at its best. She doesn't hit the signature high notes, nor are there hard-hitting guitar licks, but this is a Kelly that we haven't heard from before, a much more laidback songstress who knows how to control her voice maturely.    We first heard \\"Maybe\\" on the Addicted Tour in 2006 and all grew to love it in its acoustic simplicity, and Kelly maintained the same ambience for the album version. The lyrics are raw and revealing, and they match the music perfectly. It's a vulnerable Kelly in the beginning, but once those drums start kicking in, Kelly declares that she is \\"confusing as hell,\\" and I find that this may be the one song that most people will relate to. It's definitely one of my all-time favorite songs.    Another perfectly radio-friendly song, \\"How I Feel\\" is reminiscent of No Doubt, and it's a great song to sing along to. \\"Yeah\\" was also previewed on tour, and its funky Prince/Chaka Khan sound breaks new grounds for Kelly, complete with soulful horns and a sexy vocal. Perhaps not my favorite song, but it is a different sound, after all, and we must applause Kelly for trying new things. \\"Can I Have A Kiss\\" is one of my favorites. Not a standout vocally nor musically, but it is a great pop song with very personal lyrics and is definitely catchy.    Many have dubbed \\"Irvine\\" to be the golden ticket to the album's credibility. I've listened and listened again, and it is indeed special. The recording has a gritty, raw feeling to it (the vocals having been recorded in a bathroom on GarageBand software), and while Kelly's voice doesn't exactly standout, you can sincerely hear her desperation; it's a musical masterpiece that perfectly bookends the album. And the hidden track \\"Chivas\\" is a whimsical, tongue-in-cheek song that's one of the highlights of the album.    So yes, Kelly cancelled her tour, firedher manager, had a feud with media mogul Clive Davis, and has recently been quoted as to having a brief stint with bulimia when she was younger, but despite it all, one thing remains real and concrete: 'My December' is a mature album from our favorite songstress, and she has certainly brought the game up to a whole different level.
B000MNP2K8|1.0|Absolutely the worst James Bond movie ive ever seen!!  Whenever I think of James Bond films I think of suave men, beautiful women, great cinematography and great music scores.   This is Low Budget Bond!!
B000ERU5EK|5.0|Simply the best trance album of 2006. Listening to the whole album, one can enjoy a definitive experience of \\"future sound of trance\\" . Hard to pick a favorite, but one thing is for sure : \\"Air for Life\\" will be a true trance classic.
B000GCFO0I|3.0|\\"Silent Hill\\" is a technical masterpiece, particularly when it comes to production design.  A lot of people spent a lot of time making this movie look good.  The cinematography was interesting and attractive.  And the actors could act, a welcome change from most movies of this genre.  The little girl was very good and has a decent career ahead of her.<br /><br />I also have to give \\"Silent Hill\\" points for doing two things that horror movies often don't do.  First, it tells us the names of the characters early on, so we're not discovering an hour into the movie what the main character's name is.  Second, we actually get to Silent Hill within 13 minutes of the movie starting; it doesn't screw around at the beginning waiting to get started.<br /><br />However, this movie only gets three stars because of story/plot issues and editing.  Frankly, there isn't much story at all, just some excuses for pretty production design.  Things happen simply because they're in the script.  For example, Mom takes her sleep-disordered little girl to the creepy town in her nightmares rather than to the doctor.  And she resists arrest to do it.  I didn't buy it.  The ending comes 20-30 minutes later than it should, and leaves you wondering what the point of the whole movie was.<br /><br />Nevertheless, if you enjoy horror movies, you can do a lot worse.  This is at least worth a rent.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|Standouts for me are Hole, Sober, Be Still, Haunted, Maybe, Irvine, Chivas(hidden track).  I actually like all the songs on this CD.  Also, the bonus track from itunes, Dirty Little Secret is really good.
B000S9WLBY|5.0|Almost didn't watch this after being disappointed with Flags of Our Fathers.  I didn't like the characters in the first movie very much, but this one was quite a different story.<br /><br />It's not necessary to see the first movie before seeing Letters, but it helps to understand the context.<br /><br />Watch it.  You won't be disappointed.
0446677450|3.0|This book is worth all the hype...with limitations.<br /><br />Kiyosaki shares valuable insights into money management in a friendly tone with limited use of jargon and one can see success within reach.<br /><br />BUT, one can interpret his 'this is so easy anyone can do it' tone as somewhat head-in-the-clouds. He's rich now - he can say anything. There are times he is sharing about a successful deal where he 'just' spent $50,000 - that alienates the folks who don't even have that to spend. He writes assuming that there is some basis upon which you can build - that you have a couple hundred thousand dollars lying around to throw at some investments. It leaves one feeling 'easy-for-you-to-sayish'.<br /><br />He seems to specialize in real estate and that limits whom he can help, especially if the real estate market in your country is nothing like that of the US. Certainly the ideas and methods he taught do not apply in the least in my country.<br /><br />He does teach general ideas that are very helpful and make perfect sense. He emphasizes the attendant character and attitude that good money management takes and demonstrates said attitudes through his writing.<br /><br />I put the book down feeling like it was written for a certain type - he lost points for that - persons who have a decent amount of money already. I don't recommend it if your are working your way up from nothing like me.<br /><br />Nevertheless its worth the time and the best lesson was to get educated about money - but I don't consider him the best teacher.
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|I count \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" among my top-three favorite books...ever. So, I was really looking forward to this cinematic version of it. I was sorely disappointed. In all fairness, two hours just can't do justice to this wonderful novel, but this movie didn't even scratch the surface. And Keira Knightley as Lizzy? Didn't quite work for me. I say don't waste your money. The book is cheaper and will afford you greater hours upon hours of pleasure. I dare say, you'll want to read it again, which is more than I can say about viewing this film.

0061020710|4.0|The Colour of Magic is the first book in one of the most famous fantasy series ever. Discworld is to fantasy what The Hitchhiker's Guide to The Galaxy is to science fiction. Both Terry Pratchett and Douglas Adams practice the witty variety of British humour that so many have come to adore, though each has his own idiosincrasies, and the similarities actually end right there. Comparing Pratchett to Adams is a mistake many have made, and will probably continue to. But the fact is they're both British and write comedy, that's all they have in common.     The series is comprised of a couple dozen books revolving around Discworld and its inhabitants. I won't go into details about the planet Discworld itself, since others have already gone on about that lengthly. I'll just add that, even though the book is only a hint of what was coming next, and Pratchett himself has admitted he had no idea what would actually come next, it is already a delightful journey into Pratchett's mind.     The characters are memorable, and even though the plot is at times a little confusing, you still get drawn helplessly into the story. The book is composed of four \\"chapters\\" that could to some extent stand alone as \\"long\\" short stories or short novelettes. So it's more of a collection of stories than a flowing novel in that sense. Still it's very much enjoyable on account of Pratchett's utter genius to create remarkable characters and interesting worlds.    There's Rincewind, the cowardly wizard who only knows one spell; there's Twoflower, the naïve tourist who came from afar to see first-hand the thieves, and warriors and wizards he's read so much about; there's the luggage, a magical piece of wood turned into a suitcase that will defend its owner and master to death; there's an upside mountain where dragons appear out of thin air from one's imagination; there's Death chasing after the cowardly wizard and always missing him by very little; there's the water troll who guards the borders of Discworld and fishes all kinds of drift material, including castaways; the list goes on and on.    There's something for everyone, as long as you're open to a little silliness. Pratchett's humour is very subtle at times, and there's often a deeper meaning behind his seemingly casual observations, if you care to look into it. Not to be missed at all, and there's plenty to choose from, since most of the books in the series can be read without knowledge of the others, and each book has a main character, some are about Rincewind, some about the witches. You'll see if you give it a try.     Don't forget to try other works by Pratchett, like the Nome trilogy, Good Omens (his collaboration with Neil Gaiman), and even his young adult works, like The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents and The Carpet People.
1878424319|4.0|Though the theme is kind of obviuos, alot of people miss this ship and still do not understand how to practice the purpose of this book.It should be called \\"easy buddhism\\" LOL. I love the book though, and it took me two hours to read...so I learned alot in that small amount of time.
1416914285|5.0|I'll admit that I bought this book only because I knew the author through her old days of Harry Potter fan-fiction, but am I very glad that I did!    Cassandra Clare spins a tale of fantasy and intrigue interwoven with hilarity and sharply-witty one-liners that fly fast of the pages drawing the reader into the banter between Clary and Jace so deeply that one feels like they're standing right next to them. I can't count the times that I've laughed out-loud while reading. Sure, some of the lines are standard cliche`s but there's enough original ones zinging back and forth between the characters to make up for them. Speaking of characters, each one is well though out, and endured themselves to my memory. To quote another reviewer: \\"Clare better not kill any of them off in the next 2 volumes!\\"    Clary is your average \\"Mundane\\" who is simply trying to live her teenage life without incident...until one evening she goes to a nightclub with her friend Simon, a boy who is hopelessly in love with her but unable to get that point across (one of the troubles of having a best friend the opposite sex as yourself), and witnesses a boy killed in cold blood.    Or did she?    No evidence is in the room when the bouncer arrives and Simon thinks she crazy.     Clary Fray has stumbled upon the world of the Nephilliam, or Shadowhunters. And the killers in the room where she's standing: the gorgeous but haughty Isabelle; her dark and broody brother: Alec; and the arrogant but confident Jace, with his curious golden eyes, are invisible to everyone but herself.    Clare's debut novel pulls the reader into a world so exciting that one can't help but wish it actually existed. After all, who doesn't love a book which includes:  flying motorcycles, a fight with vampires, parties that include faeries and werewolves on the guest-list and so much action that she can barely cram in this reviewer's craving for romance (which, to clarify, she did satisfy just the same).     \\"Urban Fantasy\\" means \\"fantasy set in the modern, present-day, world\\" and if I had my way, I'd be fighting Clary for position as an apprentice Shadowhunter.    An amazing debut novel that will surely rival \\"Harry Potter\\" in years to come, I don't know how I'll stand the wait for the second book in the \\"Mortal Instruments\\" trilogy (hitting shelves in April 2008). Although, from what I've seen of the cover art, I'm sure the inner-pages will not disappoint!    P.S. I'd share some of the hilarious lines woven throughout this dark fantasy novel, but I've lent my copy to my sister (her room-mate read it in 2 days and is now breathing down my sister's neck trying to get her read it, too) and thus have no source. But CHECK OUT CHAPTER ONE on the official site: [...]
B00008O89K|5.0|Aside from the fact that this soundtrack stands on its own as a phenomenal piece of fine art, there is another thing I'd like to add to all above reviews. The score has been written so masterfully that in effect it tells the whole story by itself. Every piece has been written by the composer to reflect current scene in its spirit and with finest storytelling qualities. I have listened to these tracks over and over, and the mind drifts automatically from scene to scene with no need for visuals. You just know which moment of the movie you are in, if you but seen it once. If you haven't, you can likely imagine the scenes, as the music is alive with epic landscapes, tonal adventures, and boundless emotion. This being said, The Anvil of Crom will surely become one of your all time favorites  if orchestral scores on par with Flight of Valkyries is your thing.. I have read somewhere that the composer spent close to a year writing all tracks, and tried to make all musical elements closely resemble what people think of being 'medieval' and 'historical' sound. I know of few soundtracks which fit the screenplay so precisely, and it is the only soundtrack CD I have ever bought =)
0930289455|4.0|What with the hype coming for The Dark Knight next year, I was interested in how this comic inspired actor Heath Ledger to take a different stroke on the Joker.<br />Twisted and sarcastic, Moore's Joker offers a true psychotic version of the infamous Batman villain.  He shows no mercy, and the classic drawing of the Joker emerging from the chemical waste for the first time is priceless.<br />A definite must-read for anyone wanting a twisted and fresh version of the true psychotic Joker.

B000OCXMAE|2.0|When Linkin Park first arrived on the scene with Hybrid Theory, I loved it instantly. It seemed like such an obvious mix in music yet it had been missing until Linkin Park arrived. They seemed to fill a niche perfectly. Their follow up, Meteora, though I felt was better, was more of the same and I was disappointed that it followed the exact same production formula.    By looking at the cover alone, it's apparent that the band has changed. The image suggests introspection. Unfortunately, this is often just another production gimmick as bands so typically try to \\"mature\\" and take a more somber approach on their third album.    I, for one, was eager for this change. I felt like the band had so much potential and had enough of a unique take on a popular sound that they would be able to rise up and establish themselves above other similar bands that have come and gone in the Nu-metal scene.    I was eager for them to mature. To leave behind the high school angst and incessant screaming and let their music evolve naturally. Explore new sounds, arrangements, themes, etc.    Unfortunately, this album is so forced that it offers little to be enjoyed and absolutely nothing original or creative. Shinoda's \\"rapping\\" is all but gone and Chester continues to scream about petty issues. Worse still is that Chester tries to actually sing and carry a melody. He's proven that he's capable in the past, but the way it's presented in these songs is sometimes painful. The electronic element that set Linkin Park apart in the Nu-metal style is nearly non-existant, with the exception of poor drum machines and boring, repetative loops.    There are a few highlights. Given Up is decent with a heavy, industrial rock feel that would be great if it weren't for the poor lyrics. Leave Out All the Rest is slower and melodic and one of the few instances where Chester's voice sounds respectable. Shinoda finally shows up on Bleed it Out and Linkin Park returns to a form of their old sound - although itseems to use the same beat from Given Up... Shadow of the Day is probably the highlight of the album, although it has a definite pop feel to it. Chester sounds good and the melody really opens up with a feeling of taking a deep breath. What I've Done continues the rollar coaster of up and down emotions with another angst/retrospective/regret typical LP sound. Nothing spectacular but good.    This is about the point where you can stop listening as the remaining tracks take a dive. Hands Held High is just sorry. Shinoda makes another rare appearance but as the focus of the song he just doesn't have the presence or lyrical talent to carry the song. It's a good message, but the music doesn't do anything to support his words. With the exception of No More Sorrow, the remaining songs continue in the slow retrospective vein and pretty much fail at producing any memorable or meaningful.    Frankly, this album was a tremedous disappointment. Linkin Park should have been poised to take a step forward in their sound and instead, without knowing which way to go, they were pushed. What's left is an album, completely uninspired and lacking any real emotion. Growing up and maturing your sound doesn't have to mean getting all introspective and somber. But if you're going to, at least mean it.
1592400876|4.0|A fun book for both those who are professed punctuation sticklers and those who just want to learn more about proper comma placement. The anecdotes are funny and bring purpose to Truss's cause. It is an easy read when you get around the British style. Be assured that you will be pointing out improper punctuation around town as soon as you start page one.
0316018953|4.0|The thing I first noticed about this book was how short it was. That is the only reason it was four stars instead of five. This is a story that was first published in series form and then later compiled into a book. Despite the length of it, it is still a worthy installment in the Harry Bosch series. The \\"whodunit\\" caught me off guard, that's for sure. I can't wait for the next one!
B00005V1B2|5.0|Why don't they make albums like this any more? It is a fantastic achievement. I have listened to this so many times and I still hear things I never heard before. The is a complexity that is very listenable - a great combination. Highly recommended for someone that likes to really listen to an album.
078401213X|3.0|Offbeat moviemaking doesn't have the fascination it used to. Filming in black and white, creative editing, yer standard 'dark and disturbed' character is almost becoming rote. This movie has all that stuff, but you have to give props because of the low budget, and it was still effectively done. The prospect of a 216 digit number being the key to the universe is fascinating and for my money, they could have gone into greater back story about that, and less of the main character's slow meltdown trying to gain knowledge of it. A PBS style documentary would be great! Anyway, this moving was still entertaining, even though the style of it has been repeated enough now that it's not quite as interesting as it might've been.     One thing kept coming up as I watched this movie, which was it seemed to me that those guys who made the Matrix must have been influenced by this movie to a degree. Like they took the concept and went way out with it, but more than that, all of the shots in the subway were VERY reminiscent of Matrix scenes...the shot where the main character is in the white light reminded me of Neo meeting the Matrix creator, ...the whole numbers tie-in, Kabala, etc,etc.....
1400032717|5.0|You're in the mind of an autistic child. It gives you a greater understanding of why they bark at people or moan to themselves, yet have the ability to calculate high prime numbers. This book gives a new picture to those with mental handicaps. The story is great eventhough the mystery is solved about half way through the book. Many times I was reminded of 'The Miracle Life of Edgar Mint' even though the boy was not run over by a mail truck and urinal pucks were not involved. This book is extremely fun to read.
B00005JPD0|5.0|Wasn't quite sure what to expect when I rented this movie.... It was a lot better than I anticipated as I thought it would be some cheesy suspense movie, but it wasn't.    It was a combination action/suspense, science-fiction, time travel, and a bit of romance thrown in at the end kind of movie. The acting was superb as well as the storyline.... With the created/fabricated technology and time travel used in movie, I wasn't sure how it all was going to fit together! But everything worked itself into a neat tightly fit package by the end of the movie.

0399103422|5.0|Probably the pinnacle movie of all time is backed by a book that will easily be a classic for my children. Even though the movie follows the book well it is already starting to feel outdated with poor special effects. Now that I have read this book I feel that I belong to a special club that has an insight into the mob world and is allowed to use its terminology with a harsh Italian voice. The author creates tense, thrilling moments when he jumps ahead of the story a little bit to give a teaser. You will be on the edge when Puzo steps back and fills in the gaps. You will not get that same affect when you watch the movie. Yeah, the movie is good, but you will only get full respect for this amazing tale by getting deep into the book.
B000QUCNOK|5.0|This is a very original film, based on the exacerbation of the smell, and impelled o unsuspected heights. Based on the famous best seller of Patrick Susskind, the cinematographic proposal was very satisfactory. This promising director handled with secure hand and firm conviction this weird story about a human being with a visible lack of affection and tender (since the moment he was born) who found his bliss through the pleasure of enjoying and even to recognize the most unexpected scents and, to separate them and back to join them in new and attractive proposals.<br /><br />The suspenseful frame I which the movie undertakes is filled of daring camera work and so the edition process and the enigmatic presence of this strange collector of scents and something else that you must find out.
B0007OASII|3.0|Blah blah blah, this CD is just so-so.  It's probably good for just putting in your 100-CD changer and set the player on \\"random.\\" If  songs from this CD play, well fine.  I judge a CD by how many times I've just got to keep playing it.........this one didn't get too much attention.  It's not bad, it's just not special.  This band has so much potential to do great....perhaps they need new management, a better song selector, or just a spark.

I know nothing of motorcycle maintenance but I thought that this would be an interesting way to learn a little about it and how that simple act could relate to my life. I was quite wrong. Pirsig does discuss the various fixes he uses on his bike along his journey. Don't get fooled. He uses these side trips only to advance his main topic of philosphic confusion and insanity. If you are a student of philosphy or quality then by all means enjoy, but all others steer clear.

B00006RINF|2.0|This band has potential if they could record better songs. We need a few more female singers in Rock 'n Roll but there's no way in Hell that this girl or this band is even close to the talent of the band \\"Evanescence.\\" The song Heaven is a Lie is about as close to a good song as these guys can get.  The recording has that Janet Jackson Mish Mash where there is a lot of ground noise.....not a lot of differentiation of the instruments. The used CD stores should have a bunch of these CDs for less than $4.99 I hope this band will get rid of the male singer's influence and concentrate on writing good rock and roll and featuring the female voice in the band a lot more.<br /><br />10/21/11 - additional comments.  LOL@the Coil lovers....this band makes albums with one good song and the rest are really hurtin'.  I stand by my comments....Coil needs to ditch the guy singer, write better songs and lay down cleaner tracks.  \nn/
074325144X|5.0|A great methodology to running that will improve anybody's form. The best advice that I absorbed was to not land on my toes but on the whole foot and to lean forward. Danny's focus is on making running more effortless by using the force of gravity amd momentum. He also sprinkles in a little bit about fueling your body, choosing the proper equipment, and posture. The title may set you back but don't let it fool you; your body will thank you.

The animation looked great and the characters were memorable.<br /><br />I don't know if Pixar is capable of making a film that critics and audiences dislike. This kind of film really puts Shrek the Third to shame.<br /><br />Now off to the pet store to get my own pet rat.<br /><br />4.5 out of 5 stars
0312305060|2.0|I never felt like I got anywhere with this book. Yes, I saw how the women's lives merged, but that does not a story make. I think that is my problem. I expect a story. Books like this one and Catcher in the Rye are not focused on the story as much as the feelings and emotions of the characters. They try to give the reader a sense of what it is like to be depressed or to hold back rage and strong emotional feelings. I respect that but have not gained from it. I don't read books to be pulled down by depression and angry emotions. I read to be entertained, and that requires a story.
B000OCXF0Q|4.0|I had to buy this CD twice.  I went to Target and got the CD, along with another one.  As I'm listening to the songs, some of the words were \\"bleeped\\" out.  I'm extremely disappointed since I've never had a problem with Target in the past.  However, they seem to be following  Wal-Marts lead.  So, I will always make sure I get my music from here or Best Buy, at least I am getting my money's worth.  At least I was able to give the other CD to my step-daughter, now she can listen to it without all the bad words in.    However, Avril did a great job, I love all her CD's, can't wait for the next one.

Did you like it?\\" \\"How could you not like a book about a bear?\\" Pooh said proudly. \\"That was how I felt,\\" William confirmed.     A wonderful little book that not only introduces one to the thoughts of Taoism but also shows you how a clear mind without worry can make your life better. Don't be a Bisy Backson. Pick up this book and sit down and enjoy it. That's the whole point, right?
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|I did enjoy this movie quite a bit, and the tall tale sequences made me chuckle more than I normally would while watching a movie.  However, when I read the reviews which absolutely slaughter this film, I am inclined to agree with the criticisms.  As it approaches its climax, it too often slides into maudlin sentimentality.  It also leaves much to be desired when exploring the relationships of sons & fathers.  It is probably best not to try and seek deeper truths from this movie.<br /><br />Nonetheless, it is quite entertaining, by and large.  As Edward Bloom understood, the deeper truths of a story really pale in comparison with how good of a story it is in the first place.  For this reviewer at least, a really good story about a bunch of really good stories is justification for liking it.  My four-star rating comes with the qualification that at times, it promises to deliver more than it really can, and tries to be more than it really is, and stumbles as a result.  When it did become a bad thing to be a really good yarn?  Sometimes that really is enough.
0807126063|5.0|Ignatius is a man of conflict. He has disagreements with his mother, all of his employers, and pretty much every person he meets. He is a person that seems to be very real even including all of his extremes. He is disgusting and pretentious. But, he has been placed in a story filled with numerous conflicts and a New Orleans where he never seems to be the right fit. All of the ongoing struggles that Ignatius and the many other original characters encounter creates a fast and funny book. I had clashing thoughts myself toward the end of the book when I didn't know whether to hope that Ignatius is sent to the asylum or wish for him to escape all of the problems he has caused for himself. Either way, you know that all he will create is more conflict.
B0000C9V3T|4.0|Music is just as creative as the movie itself.   Versatile and expressive-very fluid contrasts presented.
1602830452|5.0|I have been a Sherlock Holmes reader and listener for as long as I can remember. I have read many of Doyle's original stories (many years ago), listened to all of the available Basil Rathbone/Nigel Bruce audio's and seen all of their movies, alot of the Hobbs & Shelley audio versions, most of the Stanley / Shirley versions, and many of the Jeremy Brett movies.  This collection by the BBC is far and away the best and most entertaining Holmes programs you will ever find, either on audio or on the screen. These two actors are the best Holmes and Watson you will ever hear or see (so far anyhow). I have a nostalgic affection for the Rathbone/Bruce programs and still listen to them when I travel, but they do not compare with these programs. In my opinion, even the excellent Jeremy Brett / Edward Hardwicke television programs don't have the edge and the flair of these BBC audio dramas.<br /><br />The quality of the sound and sound effects, the quality and attention to every detail and every minor part or charactor, the drama, the humor, and the brilliant acting make these a gem for Sherlock Holmes listeners.  You feel like you are in the hansom cab with Holmes and Watson. Just listening to Holmes and Watson banter back and forth in their British accent is entertaining by itself.<br /><br />I still enjoy the old Rathbone and Bruce radio dramas, but the modern technology utilized in this production shines through and takes you to a different level than the old radio dramas could ever reach. The actors portraying Holmes and Watson are top notch and take the characters to a far higher level than I have ever seen or heard before. Whatever Rathbone and Bruce had that allowed them to work so well together, these 2 (Merrison and Williams) had it as well. Oustanding performances.<br /><br />There are 16 \\"Parts\\" in this collection. Each \\"Part\\" contains a 4 CD set, for a total of 64 CD's. Part 8 contains the Hound of the Baskervilles and the Valley of Fear. This one Part alone is worth half the price of the set.<br /><br />Whether you a Holmes fan or not, these programs are so well done and so entertaining that if you enjoy audio books or radio drama at all, you will be very pleased with these programs. If you travel alot, these are a great companion.<br /><br />A great work and in my view, $157 very well spent. I would highly recommended them at twice the price.set.     Whether you a Holmes fan or not, these programs are so well done and so entertaining that if you enjoy audio books or radio drama at all, you will be very pleased with these programs.

1582701709|5.0|Although the teachings in \\"The Secret\\" aren't really new -- it is reminiscent of my mother's generation's \\"The Power of Positive Thinking\\" by Norman Vincent Peale -- , the ideas are still inspirational and potentially life-changing:  If you believe that you will be healthy, you will attract health to you;  if you are constantly complaining and perceive the world as always going wrong for you, those wrongs will continue because you have attracted them to you.  This book is worth losing one's cynicism and keeping an open mind to these ideas!
B000E97HIA|4.0|I had bought this Prince album for my girlfriend, since she is a big Price fan. The only albums that I really love from Prince are \\"Purple Rain\\" and \\"1999\\" Know, I know that Prince had released some experimental albums, where he got more away from Rock/Funk and more into jazz,  and those were OK. Some of his solo albums after Purple Rain, however, not so good. This is the best Prince release since Purple Rain. There are some great Funk songs on this album, and Prince seems like he is back with a vengence. There is some mild filler here, that makes it short from perfect, but still a great album. If you want Funk, this is the album to get.
B000HIVQBC|5.0|With this release DM finally became the truly sleazy sweaty rock band they always secretly desired to be (or at least frontman Dave Gahan did). For the followers of DM through their career this album certinaly came as a shock - it certainly did to me. But when you work through the initial resistance this album shows itself to be a truly memorable achievement. Whilst Violator saw DM master their skills and cement their position as the masters of electronic rock, this recording showed them pushing the envelope. From I Feel You's screeching guitars and pulsating energy (check out the Afghan Swamp Surgery mix on Maxi CD for a super treatment of this song!) to the stripped back Condemnation Depeche Mode moved into areas no one would have thought. Apparently recorded under extremely tense conditions with addictions and works stresses - the tensions seem to emanate from the album. The production on a DM album has never been so good and Alan Wilder's departure is sorely missed. This album clearly showed the manic obsession the guy applied to all DM productions. Every track is different and every track shows a different side to the band from the classic synth warmth of songs such as Walking in My Shoes and Higher Love to the electro frenzy of Rush and then to the soulful Get Right With Me and the super sexy In Your Room. This album shimmers, rocks, grinds and crunches. As a long time fan and owner of all their CDs - this is the CD I always come back to me when I want to release some tension. A True Classic.  Remastered Editon sounds even better - but look for the version with the documentary for some revelaing insight into the making of the album.
B000M06K5C|5.0|if you take music your music seriously, you'll feel the strong steady pulse that beats below this killer sophomore album.<br /><br />seriously.  fingers out.  put it on the cd sleeve.  keep still and wait a few seconds...<br /><br />okay. maybe if you have an imagination in hyperdrive but still, my point is that while \\"Weekend in the City\\" may lack the dancier and poppier aspects \\"Silent Alarm\\" posessed, the fact they've gone DEEPER into the instrumentals and textures and ambient noises make it so much more fulfilling!  anyone can dish out some drum machine beats and a catchy guitar hook, and while this album definitely has that (hello? \\"Sunday\\" anyone?), I love how they took the direction of my personal favorite from \\"Silent Alarm\\" (\\"So here we Are\\") and just built so much on that.<br /><br />Is \\"Weekend in the City\\" an album full of club-banger hits for the indie kids who still call themselves \\"hipsters\\" without irony?  Probably not.  Is it an album good for introspection while wandering around at 2am downtown in the city (not smart, but appealing!)?  Most definitely.  buy this album.  you won't regret it.
B00004YZFR|5.0|This documentary movie is legendary, but now that Criterion has performed a complete restoration of visuals and audio, it is really amazing! I still prefer some live versions of songs on this DVD then any other live versions released! This is the Stones in their prime! Watching this restored film on my 10 foot screen is like going back in a time machine to this raw and powerful concert. The Stones are in great form for the most part and there are some interesting extras. If you are a fan and do not own this.....BUY IT NOW!
1590171993|5.0|The reviewer who makes the connection with James Joyce's Dubliners is absolutely dead on. Williams prose pays homage to the seemingly simple fluidity of Joyce's early work. There are, in fact, at least a handful of oblique but clear allusions to Joyce's language in his final and best story in Dubliners, called \\"The Dead.\\" Stoner is a wonderful novel. It is as moving in its unsparing honesty of emotion and truth-telling as it is accomplished line by line. And as able as anything by Joyce to let the experiences, bad and good, of one man speak to what is universal in the human condition. Perhaps there was just too much going on in the America of 1965 for this quiet but indisputable masterpiece to be recognized back then. But there is no mistaking its enduring vision now, and its enduring power to move the heart and the mind as one.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Tool surprises me again.  This band has not reached their peak yet in terms of performance, and in my opinion are one of the best progressive/hard rock bands performing today.
0743277457|5.0|If you participate in any activity, job, or discipline that you wish to improve your outcome and performance in, then you will take something from this book that will aid you in your process. Simply put, this is a quality work. As an avid Tai Chi practitioner, artist, and a father I was able to find concepts in this book that I can apply to all these aspects of my life. It's a very enjoyable read due to it's 'story-like' format, and the lessons contained are pulled from some of Life's more subtle truths. However, after you are finished these lessons stay in the foreground of your life as you have a new sense of empowerment from this new tool box of knowledge. Awesome book!
B00003CWTI|5.0|This is one of the very few movies that I felt a deep emotional connection to upon watching.  Magnolia is truly a remarkable piece of artwork, and a must-see film for any movie lover.
0316018953|2.0|I hate it when I really look forward to a new offering from a respected writer, and all I get is a pot-boiler.    Not to say this fits the category, but I can smell the stew on the oven from  here.    Harry's character is more shallow than we've seen him in the past.  In fact, if we didn't know him better, we'd assume he's just another guy in a book.  More, instead of his thoughts and feeling being revealed by actions and dialogs, we're just handed what he's thinking.    The plot is OK, but lacks suspense and is single-threaded, as the reader has figured out the ending halfway through the book.    Finally, the brevity of this book is not reflected in its cover price.    I'm not saying the author didn't care about this particular book.  I'm just thinking back to some of the earlier works (Last Coyote, for example), and wondering if Harry shouldn't just have retired to some place in Idaho like all his other old pals do.    For the above reasons I rate this a 2.  I don't believe it's an absolute 2, but the author has set himself a high yardstick.  The 2 is in relation to previous Bosches.
B000IOM1RI|5.0|I am a big fan of Tenacious D's music, and I didn't like this album upon first listen.  I was skeptical about the massive amount of profanity throughout the album, and overall did not think it was that funny.  After watching the film, however, I think that this album is hilarious.  Tenacious D is comical in all aspects of their art, and this soundtrack only further proves this.  Great album.
B0001I561E|5.0|One of Disney's best movies!  Very funny.  Robin Williams does an outstanding job.
014240165X|5.0|Stormbreaker is a book that is full of suspense and action!!! It is about a boy whose uncle died in a supposed car crash. Then, some peple come and tell him that his uncle is part of M16, a British intelligence agency. They say his uncle was on a mission called,Stormbreaker when he died and they want him to complete the mission. This fast-paced book was so good I could never put it down!
0316776963|5.0|Anything by David Sedaris is better when he reads it to you than reading it yourself.  Nevertheless, it is still a great fun read.  So read.
B000IU3XTM|5.0|This album is nothing short of genius, and its even better than O.  Listen carefully and play it the whole way through and you will realise that.  Its more heart-felt, more intense, its stronger, its sexier, its angrier, its darker and its more varied. There are some tracks on O where I feel he drones on a bit. Not on 9. I am grabbed by virtually all of the songs.  For me, the stand out tracks are Rootless Tree and Accidental Babies. I saw Damien Rice play most of this album live at Radio City in New York and he was simply unbelievable. If you get the chance, do not hesitate to see this man live.  The emotion was pouring out of him. Go buy this album.
B000EDWL82|4.0|This is a very good CD with great melodies and interesting words, built around the intriguing voice of vocalist Tom Smith sounding amazingly like Dead Can Dance singer, Brendan Perry.  Indeed, a few of the songs sound like they could have been done by Dead in their heyday.  In total, a fine listening experience.
B000RJO57I|5.0|I saw this movie in theaters with a friend and we both loved it! The Climax and ending are excellent. The movie had a few jaw-dropping moments too as far as gore goes.I recommend seeing Shaun of the Dead first. If you have seen that and liked that movie then you will love Hot Fuzz. The movie is basically a parody of Cop Movies ( it pokes fun at bad boys and point break and some other famous cop movies )and Small towns....Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are a great team.....
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|Kelly Clarkson has earned her reputation as a true artist.     She has managed to produce amazing music and lyrics that are backed up with unsurpassed emotion. With My December Kelly has crafted yet another Grammy-worthy album.     Never Again opens the album with grit and bitterness that would make even the manliest of men take a moment to shiver. Kelly's vocals are spot on and she delivers one heck of a first single. 10/10    One Minute keeps the blood pumping and the toes tapping as Kelly belts out the resounding chorus \\"One  minute you laugh, the next minute you're slowly sinking into something black.\\" She manages to make the harsh lyrics go down smoothly by putting them to somewhat of a happy chord progression and beat. 10/10    Hole sounds as if it could easily be sung by the lead singer of Switchfoot but we are all glad that it is Miss Clarkson who takes the reigns on this hard-hitting rocker. 10/10    Sober was chosen as a 2nd single from My December and, might I say, rightfully so. This is possibly the best single she has ever released. The song works as one long crescendo and sends shivers down my spine every time I listen to it. Sober is a masterpiece lyrically and vocally. Amazing. 10/10    Don't Waste Your Time could've easily been found on Kelly's Breakaway album. It is catchy, radio-friendly (not that it even matters), and well written. 9/10    Judas is another highlight. It is dark with very modern feel to it. This one just wreaks with Kelly Clarkson style. 10/10    Haunted is reminiscent of Kelly's previous tunes Addicted and Hear Me. However, where Haunted outshines the others is in the emotion within the lyrics. 10/10    Be Still proves that Kelly can slow it down like the best of them. Her vocals sparkle on this piece. 9/10    Maybe could easily be played at a local coffee shop. Kelly's songwriting abilities really shine on this one. 10/10    How I Feel is probably the most radio-friendly song on the album. It is most definitely No Doubt inspiredand Kelly's voice through the entire song. 10/10    Yeah proves that Kelly is from TEXAS. I would love to hear this song playing at a bar. Everyone would love it. 10/10    Can I Have A Kiss sounds like Alanis Morrisette on vocal steroids. Kelly is amazing. 10/10    Irvine/Chivas is my personal favorite. Irvine is the best song on the album, lyrically and musically. Chivas is playful, fun, and funny all at the same time! 11/10    Buy this album NOW if you haven't already!
B000OYC3J8|1.0|I'm at work so I can't get into much detail how I feel about this album.  I would just like to say that its honestly one of their best to date.  I would give it 5 stars but the quality of the sound, the drums in particular is TERRIBLE.  You guys should have stayed with your roots and kept using that vintage recording equip. instead of the \\"new-fangled\\" garbage utilized on this one.  PLEASE JACK WHITE IF YOU'RE READING THIS ISSUE A RECALL OR AT LEAST GIVE THE FANS AN OPTION OF SENDING IN THEIR CRAPPY COPY FOR A WELL MASTERED ONE.  You honestly can't turn this album up without the distortion and crackling of meg's bass drum killing the whole song.  This garbage completely ruined the album for me, and I consider myself a very big and dedicated fan.  The White Stripes are ment to be listened to LOUD, this is simply not possible with Icky Thump and I hope fans all over the world once they finish reading this will NOT purchase this album and wait for a re-release once the duo actually listen to their own monstrosity. VERY disappointing guys VERY  PS. this is not a CD by CD occurance, they are ALL like this. :(
B000OZ2CZW|4.0|When Rihanna burst onto the music scene with her smash hit single Pon de Replay it was a general consensus she would fall into the one-hit wonder category. But with the help of Def Jam head Jay-Z, Rihanna has blossomed into one of the leading young female r&b artists of today and with her latest album Good Girl Gone Bad she proves that her second album and string of hits were not a fluke and establishes herself as a viable artist.     Good Girl Gone Bad begins with the Jay-Z assisted infectious first single Umbrella, which finds Rihanna creating an interesting metaphor for her love with the protection of an Umbrella. Although Jay-Z's verse was unnecessary and the braggadocio he offers proves to be a tad bit annoying, (\\"We Roc-a-fella, we fly higher than weather, in G-5's or better\\"), it serves as a cosigning Rihanna's viability as an artist. The album continues as a non-stop party following Umbrella.     It seems producing a contemporary r&b album of mostly up-tempo songs is the latest trend. Everyone from Beyonce to Ciara has acknowledged that it's up-tempo and not bland ballads that will garner the most attention. Rihanna follows suit but unlike her contemporaries, her up-tempo tracks pack more punch, bigger beats, and better effects. Push Up On Me is a club track that nods to the 80's without screaming 80's, Don't Stop The Music is a trance inspired dance tune with an unexpected sample from Michael Jackson, Breakin' Dishes is a volatile track about getting even with a adulterous lover and the dance-rock P!nk inspired Shut Up And Drive all keep the first half of the album an enjoyable upbeat treat.     The ballads do slow the album, Say It and Hate That I Love You featuring Def Jam label mate Ne-Yo are both throw away tracks. Three Timbaland helmed tracks the summertime anthem sex-romp Sell Me Candy, the unapologetic Lemme Get That and the Amy Winehouse rip-off Rehab appear before two more dreary ballads which fare better than the previous two.     The rare and sincere Question Existing is the only personal track on the album and finds her questioning the true intentions of new acquaintances she meets. This track provides a glimpse into Rihanna the person as opposed to Rihanna the artist fans have grown accustomed to. The final song, the ballad and title track Good Girl Gone Bad closes the album. The track's production is similar to Beyonce's Irreplaceable and finds Rihanna singing of the outcome of a woman scorned. \\"It's easy for a good girl to go bad,\\" Rihanna croons.     Good Girl Gone Bad is a stark example of Rihanna's continued growth as an artist. This album is cohesive, light and fun, everything a pop album should be. With the obvious hit singles that are packed onto this great disc, it seems Good Girl Gone Bad will be the album of the summer.     Download: \\"Umbrella\\" \\"Push Up On Me\\" \\"Please Don't Stop The Music\\" \\"Breakin' Dishes\\"

0440241030|4.0|They made it a pretty quick read and sometimes it can be tough to get through a Reacher novel; mainly because he spends so much time figuring out distances, times, etc. I understand why he has to do it, but it can bog the story down when he starts figuring all the angles in his head.     But overall, I really enjoyed the book.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|This album rocks. It's one of Rush's best albums, which is a great club to be in. But the most astounding part of it all is Alex Lifeson. Alex was always a pretty good guitarist, but he finally shines in this stellar album. His work on all of the tracks is very good, but of note are Hope and the Main Monkey Business.
0767817710|4.0|Take one of the many martial arts contests to the death movies, transplant it to the Wild West, and you have the general idea what The Quick and the Dead is about.  The head bad guy, Herod (played by Gene Hackman) sponsors a gunfight.  First prize is enough money to choke a herd of horses.  From all corners of the country they come, some nasty and some nice.  There is Russell Crowe's character, a former outlaw who has renounced violence.  There is Leonardo DiCaprio's character, only know as \\"the kid\\", who's fate is irrevocably intertwined with Herod's.  Finally, there is the mysterious gun woman, played by Sharon Stone, who has her own agenda.<br /><br />In theory, this movie should be a disaster.  Not that many critics liked it, in some circles the nicest thing said about it was \\"ridiculous\\".  This is regretful, because it is an excellent, exciting movie with precise, supercrisp camera work.  The duels, while bloodless enough to avoid an \\"R\\" rating, nevertheless come across as rough, tough and nasty.<br /><br />This is a must-see movie.
B000P6YNSE|3.0|If you're LOST obsessed, then you probably liked the 3rd season.  If you're just a normal television watcher who enjoyed the first season but thought the second season was too over the top and strayed away from what you loved about the show...well, the third season didn't help anything.    Also, the third season sees LOST desperately relying on suspenseful endings that I guess are suspenseful because there is loud music and the camera pans really quickly.  However, not even the directorial cues can hide the fact that the show's story is anemic at this point.    There is a reason why this show took a seriously ratings hit this year, cause its just too rediculous to be believed.
0316166685|3.0|I decided to read this book after hearing such good things about it. At first I was not disappointed. It is a very engrossing story and like others have said the writing is wonderful. However, to me the book took a dive when Susie has her out of body experience. I just thought that part was so hokey and cheesy. I could have done without that. Otherwise, it was a great book.
B000HIVO64|5.0|For a video-starved guy like me, the idea to release a CD with an accompanying DVD that contains a video for every song was sheer brilliance. Truthfully, I'm surprised it took this long for a big-named artist to try something like this. Then again, if anyone has the ingenuity to pull off such an amazing audio/video spectacle on disc(s), Beck is the musician.<br /><br />I love everything about \\"The Information,\\" both the CD and the DVD. There's plenty to dance to here, lots of tunes to sing along with, and some much more laid-back fare. In fact, the tail end of the disk becomes a tad more somber and uneven, but the music still kills. \\"The Horrible Fanfare/Landslide/Exoskeleton\\" reveals itself as murkier music for the diehards at 2 a.m. and counting. Still, it's great stuff until everything dissolves into a mesh of ethereal synth and a few incomprehensible voices meant to confuse; bizarre, to be sure, but also a fitting end to an album so rich in musical depth.<br /><br />This masterful CD is littered with cool hip-hop dance tracks like \\"Elevator Music, \\"1000BPM\\" and \\"Nausea,\\" which sit next to songs that mingle hip-hop and pop-rock such as \\"Think I'm in Love\\" and \\"No Complaints,\\" two playful-sounding tunes that make not liking Beck's music impossible. \\"Strange Apparition\\" has a lively country-western sound, complete with jumping piano and a suitably weird video to match. Everything on this album is smooth and instantly catchy, often danceable. The dance tracks have that big bass thump, a crisp beat and snappy drums that could get anybody moving. There are also sublime songs like \\"Soldier Jane\\" that ooze atmosphere and manage transcendence. Along those lines, \\"Movie Theme\\" is an especially moving track, perhaps the best on the album. It has a buzzing, slow-synth groove that is infectious but a little sad. The video is nothing but an electric green haze of Beck's staid face shown in a row, as if a synthetic, twisted cloning went severely bad but left us great music. His voice on the track is hardly above a murmur, making the words barely audible. When he sighs toward the end of the song, you want to sigh along with him, and maybe even shed a tear or two.<br /><br />Beck's droning voice belies the exciting array of noises that are par for the course within his well-rounded music. And his demeanor onscreen is no less understated than his endearing vocals. The DVD portion of \\"The Information\\" is chock-full of colorful low-fi videos (often with smooshy coloring and purposely grainy quality) that feature the calm Beck as the ever-present focus, amid a blur of bizarre men and women of all ethnicities performing a myriad of activities in odd clothing. Few bodily movements are spared in these videos: Kung Fu guys, little girls dancing, bears playing the drums, cars driving by, women exercising, jousting, costumes galore, retro graphics that flash incessantly -- you name it, every type of music-video chic is covered. Beck's sound might be modern, but his video aesthetic is pure retro, from slick 1970s suits, to \\"keytars,\\" to boom boxes that his minion musicians cradle in their arms. So in a way, Beck pushes boundaries in an equally forward-thinking and nostalgic manner. There's no real theme to his videos, except to behave beautifully free and act weird once \\"Action!\\" is shouted. Sometimes people just stand around looking bored, which is cool too. Everything looks like it was filmed in the same house. Beck often has a bored, dazed look about him, but after hearing this CD and seeing his videos, you realize the guy is completely in control of what he's doing.

How cool is it that the diverse songs on \\"The Information\\" also get a varied set of accompanying videos?
B0000542D2|5.0|These are \\"My Boys\\".  I don't know what else to say.  I loved them then and I love them now.  This movie transports me back to a wonderful time when they were everything to me.  I still watch it with a big smile on my face and laugh at the ease with which they toss off a \\"comeback\\" line at each other.    They look beautiful.  The sound is great.  The music is amazing still.    If you were ever a Beatles fan, the ownership of this film is a must.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|This is an excellent film with truly delightful characters.  The most evil person in the film is not really evil -- just clueless.  Rene Zellweger makes a great Potter and shows her to be ahead of her time as she opts for independence from male domination.  Ewan McGregor does a good job in playing her shy suitor.  This was a wonderful film that had no profanity, no nudiy, no explosions, no car crashes, and relied totally on the characters, who came across as realistic and believable.  Watching Beatrix grow from a shy spinister into an independent woman in love with a man who loved her for herself was a treat to watch.  True love grows by inches and this is what was shown here, so when the kiss came it was powerful and had meaning.<br /><br />This is really not a guy's movie, but any guy who wants to get on the good side of girl should rent this movie because I think most women will relate to Beatrix and for the guys it is a lesson in how patience is better than haste when it comes to women.  I liked the film -- my wife loved it!!
B00005JLR2|5.0|For Disney to make a movie like this. This is a very imaginative movie that stretches your mind to the limits of animation in a very \\"science fiction\\" sort of way. I do enjoy Disney movies because they are very orginal in their stories and characters and every movie is very unique. I do think that this one will be a classic before long for both young and old. I highly recommend this one to anyone that loves Disney movies!!!
B00005JPLW|5.0|\\"This is where we fight! This is where we die!\\"  King Leonidas says.  \\"Remember us.\\"<br /><br />The King of Sparta Leonidas (Gerard Butler) and his Grecian Army of 300 Spartans battle Persian King Xerxes's ten thousand foreign slave fighters (Rodrigo Santuro) at the Strait of Thermopylae is the premise of this epic film.<br /><br />This film is directed by Zack Snyder and is based on Frank Miller's graphic novel 300.  Director Snyder of \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" fame utilizes the some of the same cutting edge CGI graphics techniques that \\"Sin City\\" (Frank Miller novel/film) encased upon and in us.  The green screen gives the director creativity control of mind blowing proportions that relate with Frank Miller's imagination. Imagination brought to life as we read and see it.<br /><br />This is manly man's film; blood, guts and glory are glorified to the death.  Nudity and violence are prevalent throughout the film and it only slows pace when the Queen of Sparta (Lena Headey) is shown defending/supporting her King. As needed, courage, honor and camaraderie are all traits coveted when filming any war/battle film and this film is no different.  But an empathized point is the skill level of Spartan soldiers as they are bore into childhood and made into a Spartan Army soldier, he is not a part time soldier.  A soldier is life.<br /><br />The anticipated release is July 31, 2007, reserve your copy today. I can't wait for the Deleted scenes, The 300 - Fact or Fiction? and Behind the Scenes features.  Critics can battle the historical quagmire interim.
B000002MZ6|5.0|Mike's music on this CD seems to seamlessly mold to whatever mood, circumstance or environment you may find yourself in. It's in my top 10 all time favorites right up there with selections from Wolfgang, Zeppelin,Part and Miles. My only advice? Buy it!
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|With all the negative hype surrounding the album, I was expecting the worst. This album is actually not bad at all. Kelly sounds amazing as usual. Way to go Kelly for sticking to your guns and fighting to get this album out.
B00001OH7O|4.0|...there were LP's, and LP's had a Side 1 and a Side 2, and sometimes the division meant something artistically.  (I am aware that tape cassettes have 2 sides also, but sometimes the song lineup is altered, thereby compromising the artistic continuity.)  Anyway, the 2 sides of \\"Hunky Dory\\" are easy to distinguish.  The first 6 tracks comprised Side 1.  They are more mainstream in form and more musically bright in execution, even though the subject matter of some of them is quite serious.  What I am saying is, they are \\"pretty\\" in a pleasant, appealing way.  \\"Changes\\" is, of course, one of Bowie's most well-known and well-loved songs.  \\"Oh You Pretty Things\\" has great piano and an irresistable chorus, and \\"Kooks\\" is almost unbearably sweet (that's a compliment), especially the line \\"...and if the homework brings you down, then we'll throw it on the fire and take the car downtown.\\"  What a dad!  \\"Life On Mars\\" and \\"Quicksand\\" are symphonic, lyrical masterpieces, works of pop genius by any standards.  \\"Mars\\" makes you laugh and cry at the same time, but there's not much to laugh about in \\"Quicksand\\".<br /><br />Then there's Side 2.  Track 7 I dislike.  I don't even want to discuss it.  \\"Andy Warhol\\" has some good guitar action, and the lyrics are a fun and clever tribute to Andy.  \\"Song For Bob Dylan\\" is a plea for the artist to return to his early protest roots.  I theorized this, but I had to confirm it on Wikipedia.  \\"Queen Bitch\\" sounds like Lou Reed music, which is a good thing.  The final cut, \\"The Bewlay Brothers\\", is a strange, somber song with lyrics that make no sense to me - again, Wikipedia backs me up.<br /><br />Rating this album, I give \\"Side 1\\" 5 stars, and \\"Side 2\\" 3 stars, so the combined score is a 4.  If all tracks were as good as the first 6, it would be an unquestioned 5-star work.  Bowie learned a lot before he moved on to \\"Ziggy\\".
B000065BPB|4.0|these headphones sound very good.  I like to listen to music while I work so I need headphones I can wear for several hours at a time. My head is an average adult size, I would say, and I have short hair, so it's not like I'm stretching these headphones out to get them on.  But after a couple hours the tight fit starts to produce intense pain right in front of my ear where the check-bone starts.  If you want headphones you can wear for extended periods look at a different model.
0743496728|2.0|The book was gripping in some parts. It could have used some tighter editing. At times the narrative lacked crispness and clarity. The judge not immediately recusing herself was unrealistic. Although I saw the twist coming because of all of the not so subtle hints, it wasn't reasonable given the personality and background of the character. The older brother's wasn't developed as well as I would have liked. All in all an average read. Not a book I'd recommend.
B000F0UUIM|5.0|The Searchers tells the story of Ethan Edwards's five-year search for his kidnapped niece. John Wayne gives a great performance (many people argue its his best) as Ethan Edwards, a tough, proud Civil War veteran who refused to give up and who is forced to spend years of his life searching for his niece, Debbie. The journey, mostly set in the beautiful Monument Valley of Southern Utah, is truly a quest of epic proportions.     The story is intriguing, the plot fast-moving and unpredictable, and the action exciting. Wayne's performance as Edwards shows him in a darker, more unpredictable role than many of his other films, and that sun-baked, battle-hardened face covered with stubble is a visage that, in many ways, epitomizes the rough character of the American West.     The movie contains a number of stereotypes, from European settlers to Comanche Indians, that would not be considered politically correct today. Despite this, however, this is a fine film by director John Ford, one that captivates from beginning to end. Every list of the greatest Westerns of all time should include \\"The Searchers.\\"     It's great to see a classic film like this one get an excellent re-release.

He attempts to let us in to a world that few will ever experience, The Navy SEALs. This book will enlighten you, it will make you laugh through the pain and tears as you hurt for Marcus and his team or sacrificing warriors.

B00008BRB5|2.0|If you want to discover The Police, do yourself a favor and check out their first two releases, Outlandos d'Amour (released November of 1978, highlights include Roxanne, Masoko Tanga) and Regatta De Blanc (which translates to \\"White Reggae\\" released October, 1979, highlights include Message In a Bottle, Walking On the Moon, Bed's Too Big Without You). These releases have the vital energy and punk-reggae-power-trio sound that really got them noticed. I also recommend 1980's Zenyetta Mondatta. The first release in the States that got a lot of airplay on the radio, Zenyetta Mondatta managed to be commercial success while carrying forward that great sound. Hits include De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da, Don't Stand So Close To Me, Canary In a Coalmine. I purchased Ghost in The Machine when released and that was the end for me. With this release their sound began the downward spiral, losing the energy and fun of their initial releases. [[ASIN:B00008BRBG Outlandos d'Amour [Digipak]]] [[ASIN:B000AA7BFC Regatta De Blanc]]
B000H7JD4K|5.0|A lot of purists might disagree but I personally think this is Maiden's best album yet.  Well worth buying.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Entertaining, top marks for the novelty concept, excellent cast, superbly made. One of the best TV shows I've seen in years.  This one will keep your interest, and leave you wanting more.  Watching each episode for the second time is usually even more entertaining.     The books on which the series is based (Darkly Dreaming Dexter and Dearly Devoted Dexter ), not so hot, imho.
6305127646|4.0|The romance between Kilmer and Shue is extremely believable. The spy games and the basic plot are absurd, but the observer is able to suspend disbelief and join characters and creators alike on an imaginative journey of Intrigue, deception and discovery.<br /><br />In Val Kilmer's repetoire, this is probably one of his most overlooked, if brilliant performances. Too, I think Shue is not given the credit as a serious actress that she deserves. Between her performance in this and Leaving Las Vegas, people should learn to take note of her.<br /><br />A brilliant film that should have spawned a decent sequel but never did.
0765316978|5.0|The Last Colony by John Scalzi is the third and last book in a trilogy that began with Old Man's War and continued with The Ghost Brigades. John Perry and his beloved second wife are now administrators of a human colony. Because of their military and administrative backgrounds they are picked to start up a new colony - but they are not told that the real purpose of the colonists is to be bait in a deadly trap for enemy alien species. But are those aliens truly enemies? Is there any way for humanity to peacefully coexist in a galaxy filled with other intelligent life forms? Who are the real enemies of mankind? John Perry is put in a terrible place - where he must decide the future and fate of his entire species. A fitting end to one of the best science fiction trilogies I have read in a long time! Bravo to John Scalzi!
B00005JNX0|4.0|I honestly wasn't expecting much from this movie. The previews were just not that appealing. The storyline didn't seem to make any sense (from the previews.) I had no clue. (In more ways than one!)<br /><br />The fact is the movie was very smartly written. The animation was creative and very bright. It was realistic but abstract enough to be slightly amusing. The storyline is simple, but with a wide array of gags and \\"physical comedy\\" that entertains young and old alike. Of course, having said all that I must admit that the simple story is balanced by characters that are very complex in nature.<br /><br />Alex is the king of the jungle... only his jungle is the city zoo. Melman, the hypochondriac giraffe, along with lovely hippo, Gloria and Marty the laughable zebra make for an interesting zoo dynamic.<br /><br />Throw in a bunch of oddball penquins with military delusions and a gaggle of lemurs that like to \\"move it\\" and you have the screwball hit of the year!<br /><br />A perfect story for the kid in all of us.
B00008OWZC|5.0|This was made at Rock's peak and Zeppelin's Peak it has all the essentials except for When the Levee Break's.   As for all of those studiophile's who are afraid of Live music take a chance this has been produced with the utmost care and Zepp outside of the Dead, The Who, Pink Floyd and Blue Note had the best of everything.  The sound quality is great except for a few songs that they rush through but that was how they performed back then like every performance was going to be thier last.  For the icing on the cake John Bonham is on FIRE.  I have been wanting this for years after I heard it at a buddy's house don't hesitate any longer this is a must for the summer and for your ears.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|And the \\"someones\\" are Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton, who give wonderfully sweet and sassy performances in this story about Destiny almost thwarted.<br /><br />Jack plays a quitessential playboy. It seems he has a new girlfriend every week. Only this time perhaps he's found \\"the one\\" in Amanda Peet. Enter Diane Keaton, Peet's mother. A successful playwrite, she is hardly looking for romance. Comfortable in her static, routine existence, surrounded by her characters, living her life vicariously through them at times, Keaton seems blissfully unaware of her own appeal. (Typical to any Keaton character, which is likely part of her basic charm.)<br /><br />Keaton and Nicholson have a battle of wits, a battle of charms and an ultimate battle of hearts (notwithstanding Nicholson's heart attack about mid movie.)<br /><br />In the closing minutes, the question is looming... will they or won't they? And I won't spoil it... you'll have to watch it to find out.<br /><br />but I will say this... the movie is satisfying in its conclusion and is remarkable throughout. I LOVED it!
B000PFU7OO|5.0|I love this soundtrack.  Every track on this disc is good.  Glen Hansard is a talented guitar player and vocalist. Marketa Irglova is also a very talented vocalist and keyboard player. The upbeat track \\"Trying To Pull Myself Away\\" is the best of the bunch.  Hansard's vocals are so good on this track.  His guitar playing sounds different on each track.  \\"Fallen From The Sky\\" is a track with a good beat.  This song is very pleasant to listen to.  The other standout track is \\"Falling Slowly\\"  This is a very romantic song, and I think the two stars harmonize nicely on this track. \\"Lies\\" is another pretty duet on this soundtrack.  The violin playing is subtle and beautifully performed on this track.  \\"Gold\\" is a very optimistic track.  Hansard's guitar playing is very upbeat on this track. \\"Broken Hearted Hoover\\" is a very funny song.  Marketa Irglova has such a clear and sexy voice.  She sings lead vocal on the tracks on If You Want Me\\" and  \\"The Hill\\"  The piano playing on the latter track is pretty.  Her voice sounds so sad and sensual on these two tracks.  I really like them.  \\"Once\\" is a goregous sounding song about how feelings between two people change over time in a relationship.  Once is the best soundtrack of the year so far.
0425210480|3.0|I enjoyed reading most of this book, but without giving the ending away, I was very disappointed in the last couple of chapters.  If I had all US resources at my disposal, I'd send in a speedy B-1 bomber to take care of a problem much quicker than how the daring Mr. Austin resolved the crisis.      And I agree with a previous reviewer, the characters seemed very flat.
B00005JMYI|4.0|After the crime against all that is decent otherwise know as [[ASIN:B000ASDFGI Bewitched (Special Edition)]], I have come back around to giving Will Ferrell movies a chance and I was glad I did so with \\"Anchorman\\". What could have been another unmitigated disaster turned out to be a very funny story about 1970's sexism and news teams.<br /><br />Veronica Corningstone takes a new position with the Channel 4 news team and finds herself surrounding by egotistical male chauvinists. Not that she is any damsel in distress, as she can more than handle her own and she has plenty of ambition to go with it. The love thing between her and the lead anchor, Ron Burgundy, make things all the more interesting.<br /><br />With cameo parts played by Ben Stiller, Tim Robbins, and a minor role with Vince Vaughn, this movie certainly gave the story a good shot. There is a lot of \\"silly\\" humour, but it is all very good. The comedy covers a variety of bases from the purely ridiculous to the situational and more. It is a diverse movie in this sense.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie a whole lot, and have seen it a few times now. Although not something you would want to overdo, it is an enjoyable laugh at when \\"times were changing\\".
0385512058|3.0|If you're a professional business manager and it's your job to meet people and make deals, then of course Ferrazzi's advice on networking may be useful to you. In any other conceivable situation, the tactics described in this book are thoroughly annoying and insincere. My own experience has shown that if you actually have to produce something for a living, the quality of your product opens more doors than your talent for organizing meetings.  No one can possibly maintain, much less remember personal relationships with the 5000 contacts that Ferrazzi claims to have in his database. No, they're just fodder for his name-dropping, and oh boy does he drop those names. Furthermore, Ferrazzi intrudes into every aspect of life, both in and out of the office, in order to get those names. Nothing is sacred to him, not even church or family. He is the &#34;networking jerk&#34; that he warns us against. He's just a bit classier about it.  It'd be unfair to call this a vanity autobiography, because there's a handful of genuinely good tips buried in the pages and pages of anecdotes. However, it helps to know that in the first chapter, Ferrazzi declares his life goal is to become the CEO of a large corporation. It could be large corporation that he joins in its prime, it could be a small corporation that he joins and helps to grow, or it could be his own company that he starts from scratch. It doesn't really matter, because he lives solely to make the deal. He never talks about any of the good, practical, tangible things he's achieved with his networking. Sure, those things may be off-topic for this book, but considering how much Ferrazzi talks about himself otherwise, I conclude that those things simply don't exist.  If you want more out of life, this book is not for you.
B000R7GKQE|1.0|well here it is for those with  brains and like violence and good acting you should buy it !great series!
B000002IJO|4.0|RATT's third album \\"Dancing Undercover\\" (1986) sounds a lot like the first two; Van Halen/KISS derivative hard-rock with a lot of impressive, screeching solos, songs concerning sexual escapades and melodic, sing-along choruses. This time around, however, while the writing is still strong, the songs have a certain looseness to them. The album's hit singles \\"Dance,\\" \\"Slip of the Lip\\" and \\"Body Talk\\" have a certain swagger, a groove that makes them utterly irresistible. The rest of the album is also quite good, if not as strong as the singles.<br /><br />\\"Dancing Undercover\\" is probably RATT's most underrated album, and I would rank it my second favorite of theirs right after the classic debut \\"Out of the Cellar.\\" This isn't mold-breaking profound stuff here, but it is good, solid 80s rock. There isn't  a lot of filler or obligatory generic power ballads on \\"Dancing Undercover;\\" in fact, there are no ballads at all. This album is ten songs worth of dated but totally fun, infectious pop-metal that fans of the genre will love.<br /><br />\\"Dancing Undercover\\" has the advantage of not having any of its singles played to death on 80s comps or \\"retro-lunch\\" radio programs, so for those that love 80s melodic hard-rock, listening to this album will be a fresh and rewarding experience.
B000OYC3J8|5.0|I could go into great detail as to why this is a five star CD, but I don't feel like it. Suffice it to say that the Stripes do not disappoint!
B000O178BY|4.0|NIN mastermind Trent Reznor surprised the heck out of me with his second new release in 2 years (anyone who remembers the eternal wait for new NIN material the last 10-15 years knows what I'm talking about). What's more shocking than Trent's new productivity is how good this new album is--it's somehow more FUN than anything he's done in years. Manipulated samples and textures swirl around and slide up against the usual gritty beats and processed snarling--but on tracks like \\"The Good Soldier\\" and \\"Warning\\", he captures the dance-floor sleaziness that's seemingly eluded him since the inescapable hit \\"Closer\\" a decade before (of course, those songs don't approach the massive hookiness and improbable broad appeal of that radio mainstay). Seemingly, with it's raw, sampled guitar hooks, sheets of white noise and ghoulish hooks, this album seems to pick up where 'Spiral' and the song \\"Burn\\" left off somewhere back in the mid-90's before the organic band experiment that was 'The Fragile' double album.       Trent & co. don't knock them all out of the park---the burly \\"Survivalism\\" tries to whiplash itself into a \\"Wish\\"-like frenzy, but falls slightly short of that great track from 92's 'Broken' EP. Likewise, the second  half of the album meanders into slightly samey, mid-tempo glitch-tronica. Still, it's great to hear Trent obviously enjoying himself this much again, and hopefully we can expect more NIN albums of this eclectic quality, as this one sets the bar pretty high, yet again.
B000PKG6TE|4.0|Queens of the Stone Age is not the easiest band to get into.  They are one of the most original bands around, and they constantly are pushing musical boundaries with odd arrangements, guest musicians, and a variety of song tempos.      QOTSA's ERA VULGARIS is not as immediately catchy as their previous albums. It has a raw, slightly more laid back sound than Lullabies, and many of the songs need to be listened to without interuptions in order to fully appreciate the layers of musical talent that has gone into each song.  I heard \\"Sick Sick Sick\\" on Syrius Radio, and I didn't think much of it at first, because the chorus is kind of weird.  But when I bought the cd and listened to it a dozen times or so, that song became a highlight.  It has frantic riffage going on, and I like the vocal patterns on it. It's not what you sing, it's how you sing it. Josh does an awesome job of writing great vocal patterns, making each song full of hooks. He has one of the best voices in rock music. I like this album as much now as their previous ones, but what it lacks is one simply amazing song. They are all really good, but I was waiting for the track that would blow me away completely.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|I finally picked up the new cd, and was so worried I'd be disappointed after all the negativity that has surrounded the cd.  I don't get what the fuss was about.  The album is very solid.  Each song is amazing.  Kelly has one of the best female mainstream voices out there right now, and I love her diversity and depth and her fearlessness in standing up for what she believes in as an artist, her own music and her own raw talent.  Irvine is probably my favorite right now, but I also think Haunted is very touching.  It's supposedly about a friend's suicide, and I went through the same, and the song probably would have helped me at the time get through the pain of losing a close friend and the confusion of why.  Never Again, is just a strong song and she pulls it off great.  Sober, Maybe, Yeah...all are amazing.  For some reason, if I have to choose one that isn't my favorite, I'd choose One Minute.  Not sure why.  Maybe because it was for promotional reasons with NASCAR.  Anyway, it's a 5+ star.
0061186422|4.0|For some reason that I can't figure out, Gaiman decided to include \\"October in the Chair\\" and \\"How to Talk to Girls at Parties\\" in this book, when both were JUST included in Fragile Things last year.  Did he run out of stories so quickly??  I would have liked to see more new stories.
B0002OERI0|4.0|I bought this album about 2 years ago when it came out. Being an old school Greenday fan some of this album was new to me,but is changing really a bad thing. Everyone says GreenDay sold out with this LP but does growing up musically really considered selling out. If that was true than great bands such as Pink Floyd would be considered sell outs. Being a true GreenDay fan I will say some of the songs on this album sort of have the album \\"Warning\\" sound to it. So if you like good concept music buy this album!!
B000FS9FCG|4.0|Wow! It's all here...a vigilante(and failed government experiment gone rebel)waging war on a \\"totalitarian\\" society wreaking of the \\"fascism of Christianity\\", religious/cultural bias, and outright intolerance in the name of God. V's objective? Freedom by any means necessary...a donning of the mask to unmask the monstrous hypocrisies of a world under the iron curtain of a particular faith. A message shouted a million times before and a keeper for atheists and agnostics...by the way, I'm a born again Christian who's secure enough in his faith not to be offended by the portrayal of faith in this film...so if my applause is rubbing any religious heads the wrong way...grow up.
B000003TA4|4.0|This is by far one of the most overated albums of all time in my opinion. I love Nirvana,but to say this is there best album as others on this site and google sites say is insane. This is decent Nirvana but if you want to listen to there best album check out In Utero!!
0156012197|5.0|I was given this book as a gift when I was a child. In keeping with family tradition I purchased this book for my nephew for his 16th birthday. To this day my #1 favorite quote is from this book, \\"It is with the heart that one sees rightly. What is essential is invisible to the eye.\\"  Enjoy!  I doubt you will be disappointed.
B000005GYI|5.0|A lot of reviews on Amazon are so effusive and undiscriminating that it makes me distrust all of these Amazon reviews.  So I've been quite wary of all the hyperbolic praise of various CDs but have to say that this is an extraordinary record.  Anyone interested in music must buy this CD -- it has a wonderful, freewheeling and lyrical quality to the music and the singing that really stands out both in Brasil and worldwide.
B000Q6GUTI|3.0|There have been plenty of conspiracy movies--most of them involving Presidential assassination plots.  This is another.  There have been plenty of movies about the legendary skills of military snipers.  This is another.  And there have been plenty of movies featuring semeingly indestructible heroes.  Here's another--I was often reminded of the \\"Die Hard\\" movies while watching.    However, if you want a good thrill ride, this film delivers.  Solid performances, neat cinematography, and a plot with so many twists and turns that even though some are a bit implausible, chances are you won't be bothered.  Great use of surround sound will literally have you looking over your shoulder more than once.  And there are plenty of things blowing up, for those who enjoy that.    Don't expect originality, or a \\"profound\\" storyline (though some subtle references to the JFK assassination are a nice touch to watch for).  Get yourself a big bowl of popcorn, turn the volume up, and just enjoy the ride.  Much of this film will seem oddly familiar to fans of the genre, but it's definitely worth an evening.
B000HGBOS4|5.0|This watch comes in 4 models, [[ASIN:B000G6R7B8 SNK 803]] with a beige strap and dial, [[ASIN:B000HGBOS4 SNK 805]] with a green strap and dial, [[ASIN:B000HG7J7O SNK 807]] with a blue strap and dial, and [[ASIN:B000M0XJ88 SNK 809]] with a black strap and dial. What I like most is the red tip on the seconds hand that sweeps continuously across the dial and not in steps for every second like in most analog watches. Also cool is the untraditional numbering of the hour markings, where the 5-minutes are more protruding than the hours. The strap looks better in the photos than in reality, but it's still very nice and tough-looking, although it is narrower than you think when you see it on the guy's arm in the pictures above. The strap looks better in the photos than in reality, but it's still very nice and tough-looking, although it is narrower than you think when you see it on the guy's arm in the pictures above. The see-through case is a gimmick I could do without, but anyway, nice to watch the watch work. Buy all four and you have one to go with every occasion and dress colour/code. This item sells on eBay for 30-40 dollars.
B000QFAJ7S|1.0|I am a huge Kelly Clarkson fan, and have been looking forward to the release of her new album for several years now.  Boy, was I disappointed.  The new album is a completely different style than her last two... and by different, I mean, it sucks.  I ran out and bought this album the day it came out, took it home, listened to it, and slowly lost hope that there was one good song on the album as each track played.  It seems as if Kelly is trying to take on the image of hard-core rock girl... and it just isn't her.  While this style works for female artists such as Pink and Amy Lee of Evanescence, Kelly needs to stick to her roots.  Being a pop artist is what she is good at, and the so-called rock music was a bad choice.  Let's hope that Kelly goes back to singing the music she's good at for her next album.

What I like most is the red tip on the seconds hand that sweeps continuously across the dial and not in steps for every second like in most analog watches. Also cool is the untraditional numbering of the hour markings, where the 5-minutes are more protruding than the hours. The strap looks better in the photos than in reality, but it's still very nice and tough-looking, although it is narrower than you think when you see it on the guy's arm in the pictures above. The see-through case is a gimmick I could do without, but anyway, nice to watch the watch work. Buy all four and you have one to go with every occasion and dress colour/code.

0316018953|4.0|This is a compact and rapidly moving book involving execution-style murder, the theft of cesium, and allegedly terrorism. Of course the best thing about this latest in the Harry Bosch series is Harry Bosch. He's older but still no-nonsense, persevering, thorough, and courageous. His dicey relationship with higher-ups in the LAPD and even more so with the FBI is still present.<br /><br />For those of us who have read all of the Bosch books, the deeper, more introspective Harry is missing, which is what has made the series so compelling. Though he meets ex-flame FBI agent Rachel Walling on the case, the hesitant romancing of Harry is missing here. He is still a jazz aficionado and knows the streets of LA like the back of his hand. This book will have to do until the author lets the reader catch up on Harry's life outside of the crime world.

B000Q6GUTI|5.0|Gunnery Sergeant Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg) is the best scout-sniper in the U.S. Marine Corps.  On a convert mission in Ethiopia he does his job but things go wrong and his spotter (Lane Garrison) is killed after they are hung out to dry by the shadowy figures running the operation.  Thirty-six months later back in the world Swagger has left the military and lives with his dog on a mountain in Wyoming, minding his own business.  Then Colonel Johnson (Danny Glover) shows up with an offer for an unusual job.  Word is out that somebody is going to kill the President of the United States in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia and Johnson wants Swagger to scope out the scene and tell them exactly how he would do it so that they can stop the assassin.  Swagger does his job, but it turns out to be a set up and once the fatal bullet is fired he is the most wanted man in America.<br /><br />This week I am very much aware that what you think about a movie can depend on what else you have just seen.  I saw \\"Shooter\\" on DVD the day after seeing \\"[[ASIN:B00005JPQT Live Free or Die Hard]]\\" in the theater.  My favorite scene in the new summer blockbuster was the one early on when John McClane has to rescue a computer geek from a hit squad that is shooting apart the kid's apartment.  It was, relatively speaking, one of the most realistic sequences in the film and with that thought fresh in my mind I liked that most of \\"Shooter\\" was in a similar vein.  Of course, this is predicated on how realistic you consider kill shots from a mile out to be.  I read somewhere that there was a sniper shot in Iraq that took out the target at three-quarters of a mile, so 1800 yards does not sound like all that much of a stretch to me and not that much to ask in terms of the willing suspension of disbelief.  Besides, if an expert sniper can train an actor like Wahlberg in two days to get hits half the time from 1100 yards out, then I am willing to go along with the ride in this film.<br /><br />In a movie like this a lot of it depends on the other characters besides the hero.  Glover is okay as the man out to get Swagger, Beatty is channeling his role in \\"[[ASIN:B000CNESU8 Network]]\\" way back when, and Jack Payne (Elias Koteas) is one of those giggling goons that I doubt would be able to get this gig in the \\"real\\" world.  Rade Serbedzija as Michael Sandor has the requisite weight, but few opportunities to really swing it around because his character is subordinated to people who are clearly not his superiors.  Fortunately the good guys are also after Swagger, so he has plenty to contend with here.  I also liked the fact that the FBI were not portrayed as total idiots, and that once things were not adding up the way they thought they started redoing the math, just like Nick Memphis.  I even like the nudge nudge, wink wink near the end that suggested that the government might have its hands tied but that is not true of everybody. Once we get past the rather cartoonish villains, the characters helping out are hero turn out to be a lot more interesting.<br /><br />In this sort of movie there is always the woman the hero turns to in his hour of need.  For \\"Shooter\\" that would be Sarah (Kate Mara), the widow of Swagger's spotter, who is literally the one person on earth who would believe a word of what he says.  I liked that this was a woman willing to shoot first and ask questions later.  Sometimes the woman becomes the hero's sidekick, but in this film that role goes to Michael Pena as Nick Memphis, a rookie FBI agent who gets in Swagger's way early on and keeps asking questions when his bosses are telling him to shut up.  He finds somebody to talk to in Agent Alourdes Galindo (Rhona Mitra), but that only serves to make him another person on the bad guys' hit list and forces him to decide which side he wants to be on for the duration.  But the reason I finally decided to round up on this film was because of the the character of Mr. Rate (music legend Levon Helm), a guy who knows everything about government conspiracies and even more about guns.  Swagger pays the old guy a visit in a scene nicely written by Jonathan Lemkin (the screenplay is loosely based on the novel \\"[[ASIN:0553563513 Point of Impact]]\\" by Stephen Hunter).<br /><br />So, yes, the whole idea of a conspiracy so big that one guy does not stand a chance going up against it is old hat, but I liked that Whalberg's character just does what he has to do without spouting one-liners and I thought his performance was a lot more compelling here than it was for his Oscar nominated role in \\"[[ASIN:B000M5AJQS The Departed]].\\"  I liked that the film emphasizes the importance of teamwork to a scout-sniper and works that into how things play out.  The hero is a sniper and his solutions almost always have to do with firing a gun, usually a rifle and usually from a long way off.  If this film is nothing more than the Bush-era version of \\"[[ASIN:B0004Z33G4 Rambo]],\\" then I found the experience a whole more enjoyable this time around.ws everything about government conspiracies and even more about guns.

0156027321|5.0|I read this book in a book group, and I have never had so many questions and discussion topics from a book. That is a tribute to the skilled writing by Yann Martel in this survival multi layered story.    The first 100 pages or so are not the most exciting times of the book, but they are VITAL to defining the religious/cultural themes engrained into the novel. From the moment that Pi's ocean liner sinks, readers will be enthralled in the ups and downs of his fight for survival. Martel's writing is brutally honest, but at the same time layered with so many different elements of themes that all combine to make Life of Pi a moving, complex and mature book, despite the surface content. Life of Pi is very much worth reading, it will renew your faith in religion and brings new questions to human nature.
B000QXDEDG|5.0|Frank Miller adaptations are on a roll. First we got \\"Sin City,\\" and now we have the story of three hundred Spartans who repelled a massive invasion.<br /><br />And the adaptation of \\"300\\" is a stunning one -- literally stunning, since it bombards the viewer with larger-than-life characters, smashing visuals and tight direction. It goes a bit too fast for its own good, but it's a truly epic film that takes the historical war movie to another level -- all the more so because it actually happened.<br /><br />As the introduction tells us, the Spartans were the ultimate warrior people. Babies were inspected for weakness or faults, and killed if they had any; as they were growing up, they were taught and toughened by a savage regimen. Their only true hope was to \\"die beautifully\\" for their land.<br /><br />A Persian messenger arrives, telling King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) that the god-king Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) wants the Spartans to bow to him. Leonidas' response: shove the Persians into a pit. But before he can go to war, he must consult the corrupt priesthood of Ephors and their beautiful Oracle. She predicts that Sparta will fall and the gods forbid war at the approach of the Carneaian festival -- courtesy of a hefty bribe from a Spartan traitor.<br /><br />So Leonidas takes out three hundred of his best men, along with their nervy Arcadian allies, and begin trouncing the Persians. But they are being sabotaged, both by a hunchbacked outcast and by a treacherous councilor, whom Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) is battling. And so at Thermopylae, Leonidas prepares for a final battle against the monstrous Persian Army -- knowing that their story of freedom will live on.<br /><br />This is not a \\"sensitive\\" movie where you have any appreciation for the bad guys -- it's a glorification of three hundred soldiers who died for their land and freedom. It just wouldn't work otherwise. It doesn't blindly adore the Spartans -- we see their darker side in their \\"weed out the weak\\" policy -- but it does appreciate them. They respect and care about each other, and Leonidas is as kind as he can be even to Ephialtes, the traitor.<br /><br />And it's done in a manner appropriate to its comic book origins -- grimy, bloody and epic, but with a stylized look that is almost like CGI. The battles are shockingly good, and full of fantasy-ish creations like the monstrous creatures or the silver-masked Immortals. Even a wall of corpses. But we also get some beautiful visuals as well -- roiling seas, sunlit battlefields, Spartan cities, and the drugged Oracle in her white veil.<br /><br />While the script gets a bit over-the-top at times, it's hard not to be moved by dialogue that can be darkly funny (\\"It's just an eye. The gods saw fit to grace me with a spare\\") or stirring (\\"He did not wish tribute, nor song, or monuments or poems of war and valor. His wish was simple: \\"Remember us.\\" That was his hope, should any free soul come across that place, in all the countless centuries yet to be\\").<br /><br />Butler and Headey are simply great as Leonidas and Gorgo -- they're both strong, passionate and fearless, and they both do a great job in their separate storylines. But the movie is filled with good performances -- David Wenham as the narrator, Dominic West as a disgusting traitor, Santoro as the decadent, arrogant god-king, and many others.<br /><br />\\"300\\" is a unique, stirring, stunning movie that pushes the action-movie envelope, and gives a thrilling edge to a real-life story of overwhelming edge. A brilliant movie.They respect and care about each other, and Leonidas is as kind as he can be even to Ephialtes, the traitor.

B000002UAX|5.0|This was the album where the Beatles grew up and moved into a more mature and less organised sound.  That road had begun with \\"A Day In a Life\\" and \\"Within You Without You\\" and \\"Good Morning\\" in Sgt Peppers - but the Beatles were still a smart pop rock band then.<br /><br />In the White Album, there is a wonderful sense of a loss of control - and yet this is still the Beatles at their creative peak.  Not caring what people think, they're just playing to the maximum of their abilities.  And shattering barriers.<br /><br />The power of their varied personalities comes through.  And different sides of their personality.  Who cares about anything except the music I'm feeling now? seems to be the prevalent thought here.  The White Album is the Beatles Matured - who would have imagined that the Beatles would create \\"Helter Skelter\\"?  or \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\"...Epic stuff that certified that the Beatles could rock.  \\"Dear Prudence\\" and \\"Sexy Sadie\\" and \\"Blackbird\\" are eminently listenable.  In fact - apart from some ditties and departures - the album is strikingly distinctive as a playground of sounds - it is dynamic from one end to the other and still eminently listenable and deep.<br /><br />How do you define genius?  This is one hard album to ignore.

B00005JPFC|4.0|Remy (Patton Oswalt) is the only sewer rat with a refined taste of food, while his father (Brian Dennehy) is more used to the natural way of the rat. After a tango with an old lady, Remy is seperated from his family. All hope is lost until the spirit of former master chef Augustus Gusteau (Brad Garrett) helps Remy find his way into a former five-star restaurant, owned by Gusteau no less. There, after getting caught during an attempt to fix a nearly spoiled dinner, he forms a partnership with janitor Linguini (Lou Romano). Remy is able to control the janitor like a marionette, giving the young rat a chance to begin his journey to making himself known about his talents. Just as long as he can avoid being caught by arrogant chef Skinner (Ian Holm), specter-like food critic Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole), and a host of other quirky employees.    Once again, Pixar is out to show the other companies who rules the school. Returning from his stint with the surprise 2004 hit \\"The Incredibles\\", director Brad Bird assumes position for this throwback to classic slapstick cartoons from the Disney vault. It's a little bit of a sketchy mess that overstays its welcome, kind of like \\"Cars\\", but its breezy pace and a great cast (comprised of comedians and character actors) make it a charming diversion.    \\"Ratatouille\\" marks Bird's first foray into animal territory, switching from the humans in Incredibles with rats. There are humans populated in the film that share screen time with the rats. Like I said above, Bird is going for a more madcap tone that calls to mind classic Walt Disney cartoon shorts from the '30s and beyond, and with hilariously caricatured designs of the humans (Gusteau and Skinner score major points thanks to vocal work from Brad Garrett and Ian Holm individually), the director has done his job. Of course, there are life lessons to be heard, but after the disappointing and mawkish \\"Meet the Robinsons\\", I warmed up a tad more to Ratatouille.    Much like \\"Incredibles\\",\\"Ratatouille\\" benefits from tight camera work. Even though it isn't set in the real world - as if we didn't know that - the editing makes every dolly and pan feel pretty darn real. Take for example the chase between Remy and Skinner, which somewhat recalls the work of earlier Bond films (a certain secret weapon Bird used in his recent Pixar film). Being it a Pixar film, that's absolutely no surprise.    Not all is perfect in France, however. As charming as it is, \\"Ratatouille\\" gets too big for its britches, adding in some needless subplots, including a tacked-on romance between Linguini and Colette that somehow could've been cut (even if the girl character is sort of an important plot point, and well played by a reliable Janeane Garafolo), and a message from the food critic that becomes another trick from the Heartwarming 101 book. Of course, the film doesn't abandon its wacky tone, rather than get preachy and overtly inspirational.    Bird has assembled a good cast here, a talented bunch of comic actors and character actors. Underrated comic Patton Oswalt is a delightful presence who matches the personality of Remy, as well as gaining some milage when sharing the screen with Brian Dennehy's father rat character. Lou Romano is a good charming presence as Linguini, while Ian Holm is a campy delight who makes the scheming Skinner all the more colorful and vivacious. Impressive support also comes from Will Arnett, Peter Sohn, Peter O'Toole, and a bunch others. Too bad John Ratzenberger isn't used to his full potential (same thing happened in \\"Cars\\").    \\"Ratatouille\\" is a delightful film. Though I'm jonesing for the irreverent attitude of \\"Surf's Up\\" earlier this month, Brad Bird offers a pleasurable enough throwback to screwball cartoons of the past that has enough culinary charm and eye-popping visuals that do a good solid job. Those little candy-coated joys I'll choose over \\"Robinsons\\"' corny preaching that get in the way of whatever charming moments it had already.It makes me even more intrigued for their next film, the futuristic adventure \\"Wall-E\\".
630522577X|3.0|Yes, it is a nice Cinderella story, and Audrey plays a fine role.There is an excellent message about the ingrained Brit Class System circa 1910..And there are some nice costumes, mainly women's hats, at the Horse race..Add to this a few memorable songs..So what is the problem with this ? Mainly, the near- nauseating character of Higgins, an old fashioned snob and misogynist of the ugliest type, who we have to watch sneer and scold for the better part of two hours! Not pretty! True, Pickering is a nice counterpoint, and really a decent old chap, but Higgins is the main character, and to watch and listen to this old goat goes well beyond a pleasant way to spend time! The song and dance numbers are hardly even third rate. Any comparison with a 1940's-50's MGM musical puts this one to shame! No dancing to speak of, and very low production quality..Then again, this was Warner, not known for musicals!..And there is a claustrophic sense here that says , \\"How can I get away from this miserable phonetics teacher?\\" It's near impossible..I can think of at least 30 musicals far and away above this, not just MGM, but Fred and Ginger, and so forth..In fact, 3-stars may be too kind for this one, since it is way below the hype!..Also, check out the 1930's PYGMALION with Wendy Hiller and Leslie Howard, and you can easily see how almost the entire movie (MY FAIR LADY) was completely taken from PYGMALION, including the sets and dialogue..About the only thing new is the songs, which are fun and amusing, but not really in the top tier of great musical tunes.

B000PTYP5C|3.0|I have now listened to SC about 50 times (updated 2008), with several days off mixed in.  My first impression was underwhelming but DT albums have a way of growing on me.  After some reflection, I now think this is one of the weaker DT albums to date.  I find ToT and O to be superior albums.    That not to say there's definitely some good to be found here.  The musicianship is still top notch in most places.  Sadly much of it sounds too derivative of previous albums - even for DT.  Some of the lyrics (dark master, profits) are embarrassingly immature.  Maybe I'm getting too old, but this is the first DT album that made me feel this way.    I would still recommend this album to the die hard DT fan, but I found Systematic Chaos to be a mediocre effort at best.  My rating of 3 stars may be a little generous.  SC feels like a rushed, stream of conscious effort from musicians who can do better.  I think this album could have benefited by spending a little more time in the oven.
B000FS9FCG|4.0|I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I thought I would have. It Really is worth viewing in my humble opinion and is nowhere near as bad as some professional critics claim it to be. I thought V was a very good character and Hugo Weaving did a great job of portraying him on screen. It's taken me awhile to get around to this movie but now I've watched it it's on my \\"to watch again\\" list for sure. Great stuff!
1582701709|3.0|This book offers a few inspirational quotes, but I didn't buy the whole idea.  It's great to think positively as a general way of life, and this book did speak to that concept.  However, sending out positive thoughts to receive tangible items is too far fetched to me.
0375701427|4.0|Though Roth is a bold stylist-- with monologues and rants much of the time--and addresses topics like sex and violence in a rather \\"open\\" way with much satire and detail, the strength of this novel is the way Roth explores themes and characters with nuance and subtlety. The novel is about a guy Swede who has it all and has the perfect \\" American\\" dream life with a country home, great job, a beautiful wife, and a child...but it all goes awry when his daughter Merry becomes a terrorist and blows up a post office where a person is killed. It's a big novel that addresses many American themes: politics and political correctness, race, religion, innocence, family life, and societal norms. It's a novel that works on multiple levels: a mystery and paranoid horror story about a man who doesn't understand why his daughter did what he  did, a family drama, and a social commentary. Roth's portrayal of Swede's downward spiral into self-doubt, confusion, and anger gives this intellectual novel great emotional heft. Roth's portrayal of Swede's love for his daughter and wife are particularly moving.     The weakness here is that Roth tends to be a bit long winded and is almost too detailed: certain segments on the intricacies of glove making ( Swede is an owner of a glove making shop)  and historical background of certain Jersey towns... I could have done without. Overall, it's a smart, entertaining, and topical novel...and Roth's message seems to be this: moderation, in both one's personal and political life, is key.
B000OCXMAE|3.0|This CD was disappointing.  there are like two good songs on the whole CD.  Definitely not worth the whole price of the album.  Minutes to midnight is by far the best track on the disk.  I own everything that linkin park has released, including reanimation as well as live in texas.  This is by far the worst album.
B000LXH0AE|3.0|First, I'll list what I like about the movie. The casting, the performances and most of the dialogs were very good. I can't think of a bad performance. The dialogs were quirky and thoughtful. Lines within their context are very good indeed. I like \\"So I decided to save the world one cookie at a time.\\" Within its context, it is a fairly profound line. Ferrell is very good in this. Emma Thompson is awesome.     Second, I'll list what I dislike about the movie. The premise doesn't quite work. Does the Ferrel character hear the voice of the narrator within the novel itself. If he doesn't, I can't see how the author could explain his decisions about changing his life. If he does hear her voice within the novel, the ending does not make any sense. The author changed the ending because the character knew he was going to die in the novel and told her to finish it anyway. You get into the bootstrap problem because the author should have known because she's writing the character. Maybe I missed something? However, my main point is, the story drags because you think you know the character is going to die for most of the story. The plot just plods along setting everything up for the climax. The quaint characters and the spiffy dialog don't quite make for great movie.     I would give it 3 1/2 stars because of the performances.
B000LC55F2|5.0|Wow! A review of this movie! That's not an easy thing. And the confused beginning and drawn out silences make it difficult to separate past from present from future and determine where you are in the story. But, after Christian Bale is responsible for the death of Hugh Jackman's wife, Piper Perado, the hatred between Jackman and Bale ratchets upward to obsession, with each magician exposing the tricks of the other. Both have found the ultimate trick, the transported man, involving exact doubles. It isn't clear how Bale found his duplicate, nor is it obvious until afterwards that his own personal tragedy, the suicide of his wife, Rebecca Hall, is the result of his double. But the extent of Jackman's obsession is shown by his rejection of his beautiful assistant, Scarlett Johansson, and his funding the research of Nicoli Tesla, a very real and very eccentric scientist of the period played by a stoic David Bowie. And when Jackman uses a duplicate to lure Bale into being accused of murder, and obtains custody of Bale's daughter...well, I've already said too much and the final plot twist should be left as a surprise.
B000PY52EU|5.0|I honestly didn't know what to expect when I first viewed this movie - the trailer seemed lurid, and suggested a sexy, exploitative movie. Well, on the surface it does appear to be that, but it is so much more - Black Snake Moan is a southern tale embedded in blues music, and portrays a very real human drama of two tormented souls that heal each other, albeit in an uncoventional manner. Samuel L Jackson , in one of his best performances since Pulp Fiction , portrays a god-fearing man, Lazarus, who finds a half-naked young hussy, Rae [sexy, amazing Christina Ricci] on the road near his house and takes her in to nurse her...only he finds that Rae's wounds go way beneath the superficial, and it is her soul and spirit that need nurturing and healing. When Rae decides to bolt, Lazarus chains her to a radiator [!], and eventually a grudging acceptance develops, and in healing Rae, Lazarus finds his own redemption and salvation. Despite the torrid background [Ricci is half-naked in most scenes in the movie] & the foul-mouthed Lazarus, there is a poetic beauty to this movie...the pain of the main characters is altogether palpable, and one can't help empathise with their respective plights, and there is even humor, though of the darker variety...all in all, a very watchable human drama with sexy undertones that don't really seem exploitative to me, just a means of enhancing the story.
B000P2A24W|5.0|I bought the CD the day it was released and I have played it non-stop.  It's been a long time since I've bought a CD and liked every song on it.  I've been a Bon Jovi fan from the beginning, have all their albums, go to every concert I can and I still wasn't worried when I heard Bon Jovi was produing a \\"country\\" influenced album.  I guess I feel that these guys do everything well, and this album didn't let me down.  When I listen to music I want it to say something to me, and so many songs on this album do.  \\"The Last Night\\" and \\"Seat Next To You\\" are just beautiful songs but the bonus track (Target Purchase) \\"Walk Like A Man\\" makes you stop and listen, knowing Dave and Richie are grieving over the loss of their fathers and listening to this song about a father/son relationship, how can anyone say that they are in it for the money.  These guys still have alot to say, and frankly, when they are saying it with songs like these, I'm all ears.
006054094X|5.0|The author's thesis is true. Chinese are more advance than any other countries before 'til now. The inventions and science of the Chinese are far from the Westerners. Why some or mostly westerners got famous or came out such this ideas (inventions)? because they copied it from the Chinese/Asians. That is why western navigators have thought of going to explore the globe because they've got the complete map from the Chinese...<br />The author is correct that the chinese had a gun and cannons when they explored. Why? because they are the one who invented the gun powder. If the chinese have plan to take europe and america at that time it's possible because there enemies used swords and bows while the chinese use guns and cannons.<br />You can still see it today that Asians are more highly advance than the far West.<br />Example: 11yrs. ago in far east Asia have text messaging on there mobile<br />  devices while on the America still not yet heard of it... not until 2yrs. ago that they discovered text messgaing is more easier than pagers which still used by some westerners today while in Asia never exist already. (too backward for the Asians to used that) And Westerners before would say why use text instead of calling or paging there is no use of text message. But they didn't think that text messaging are similar to email message.

B0000027RL|5.0|There is a reason that this cd has been considered by many to one of the greatest debuts of all time. Every single song on this cd is absolutely perfect. I just can't get enough of this cd. The lyrics are unforgettable, i.e. \\"Try to erase this from the blackboard\\" from Jeremy, and \\"I know you'll be a star in somebody else's sky\\" from Black, and Mike McCready delivers some of the best guitar solos of any grunge band of the day. And no one but Eddie Vetter could pull of such beautiful singing, and to me he might be one of the greatest vocalists of all time, along with Layne Staley and Chris Cornell. So if you're only going to buy one Pearl Jam cd (you're crazy) make it this one. You won't be disappointed.

B000O75F7C|5.0|Many months ago, a friend of mine gave me Porcupine Tree's 'Metanoia' CD.  It was boring.  I'm stunned at the difference between that CD and this one. 'Fear of a Blank Planet' is amazing.  It sounds like... Tool meets Rush... complex music and hard, at times.  It's also mixed very well, it sounds excellent.  I highly recommend it.
0345350499|5.0|When I first read this book at the age of 15, half my lifespan ago now, I finally discovered what I had found lacking in religion up until then: the feminine. It had such an impact that I made it an annual ritual to reread this book all the way into my mid 20s, something I have never done before or since with any other book, no matter how wonderfully written.  It tuned me into the power of what it is to be female and having the gift of birthing and nurturing life, a little taste of being part of the sacred wheel of life.

B0007Y08IS|5.0|Offensive and funny in the way that puppets expressing emotions, engaging in violence, having sex without sanction of sacraments and Church, and hurling obscenities can only be. I could not stop laughing the entire time.<br /><br />I'm somewhere to the right of Vlad the Impaler, so the old right-bashing left-bashing arguments so beloved of South Park Republicans (mostly libertarians) don't carry much truck with me. Rightist hypocrisy and false braggadocio are on full display here, along with over-the-top chuckle-headed nationalism an inch deep and an ocean wide filled with the tears of sentiment and absent boarders of reason. On the flip side, self-righteous Hollywood poltroons are given their full display, and no gasbag disappoints. What is more remarkable is how little the caricature of the puppets differs from the actual spew of their objects. Perhaps that is funniest of all.<br /><br />This film makes full use of the liberty of comedy, employing and invoking the ancient rights of jesters everywhere to have no sacred cows. If you think of the film seriously, there is absolutely no way you can not be offended. If you enter into the Rabelaisian world of suspension of disbelief and watch the puppets become the morality play within the interior of the melodrama becomes evident. The admonition \\"That which stimulates our senses but at the same time does not elevate our morals is pernicious\\" is defeated by the exquisite combination of Rabelais, Satire, Machiavelli, and explosive plasticine. We are better for the distractions of the jesters: let them play on.
B00000739S|5.0|Yes, it's from the same show that produced the peerless ROCK AND ROLL ANIMAL, but there's a reason it wasn't released as a double album along with that classic.  R&RA is non-stop killer and this one just isn't.  It isn't bad in itself; it's just that the bathos effect is, well, in effect.  Heck, there isn't even a live shot on the cover so you don't get another gander at Lou's black fingernail polish.  Dick Wagner and Steve Hunter are, of course quite awesome.  But after all these years, I still wonder:  is that Lester Bangs bellowing \\"LOU REED SUCKS!!!\\" after Sad Song?

B000MRAAJM|5.0|To get the negative out of the way first, I was a little disappointed with some of the video footage used.  I believe some of this was older stock footage in SD up converted into HD.  There is no other explanation for the noise in some of the pictures, other than poor encoding/filming practice.    That said, most of the footage in this series is simply spectacular.  I give the film 5 stars not only for the HD video content, but for the narration and most importantly, the content of the documentary.  I have never seen such a well filmed and edited piece of work.  You must own this even if you have to buy the SD version, but, since Blu-Ray and HD-DVD players are really coming down in price, and if you have a HD display, you MUST BUY THIS SERIES.    Hands down, the showcase for high definition DVD and educational content today!  Both the beauty and brutality of nature will take your breath away.

0205313426|4.0|\\"The Elements of Style\\" was written by E.B. White in the 1950s. It is a revised and expanded version of a booklet used by his English professor William Strunk Jr. in 1919. During the years since its publication, the book reached the fourth edition, modernized and more suitable for the times (and the changes in language).<br /><br />While this book was originally aimed at writers (of books and newspaper articles), solid writing skills are important for everyone. In these days of the content-rich web, people spend a lot of their collaboration time online. Blog entries, comments, forum and mailing list posts are quite a bit of writing, and one has to follow some simple but important rules to write correctly and effectively.<br /><br />What's best about it is the size. These days, when the feeling is that writers and publishers get paid by the weight of their huge tomes, it is refreshingly pleasant to hold a small pocket book of only 100 pages, packed with useful information. The guidelines for correct writing are presented as a list of rules, divided to a few subtopics, with a well-selected index making things easy to find.<br /><br />The book answers some of the most common doubts in writing English text:<br /><br />  1. Correct usage of punctuation: commas, colons, semicolons, dashes and periods.<br />  2. Possessive singulars of nouns (\\"Charles's book\\")<br />  3. Using the active voice, positive form and definite, concrete language for making a point effectively.<br />  4. Pairs of words that are commonly confused: among/between, inside of/inside, shall/will, that/which<br /><br />On the downside, this book can be seen as overly pedantic. Some words it discourages to use are already ingrained in modern English, and the strict rules it contains aren't the best fit for all kinds of writing. Therefore, I would not advise using this book \\"religiously\\" as something obliging. Rather, it is best used as a useful reference for certain things. Some rules you might not agree with, but most of them are just plain common sense of English writing, and rules like the ones I listed above are decidedly essential.nse of English writing, and rules like the ones I listed above are decidedly essential.
B000OYC3J8|3.0|I like the White Stripes but I don't buy into the whole 'genius' thing associated with them. There is almost nothing original in this album. There are certainly catchy tunes here, but there are some downright annoying songs on this album too. That's pretty much the way all White Stripes albums are. I love the guitars though. Meg can't play drums to save her life, but she's got a juicy style. Once in a while you get a clever lyric. Are White Stripes the best thing to hit rock & roll this decade? No! But they're catchy, fun, and interesting so that works for me. I'll take this album over the 1000 useless pieces of trash put out this year by other musicians.

B0000089FS|4.0|The \\"Strikes Back\\" portion of this title was apt at the time. Elton had completed surgery on his vocal chords that - as he had been warned - could have resulted in his never being able to sing again. He'd also won a pair of important legal issues; He and Bernie Taupin had succeeded in their challenge to Dick James Music for royalty payments owed, and Elton's lawsuit against a tabloid for slander had been ruled in his favor. So it was a renewed and feisty Elton who was ready to record \\"Reg Strikes Back.\\"<br /><br />It shows the reinvigoration. While \\"Reg Strikes Back\\" is still very much an 80's album (heavy on synths and drum machines), the songs are uniformly strong. He even went as far as to update \\"Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters\\" from \\"[[ASIN:B000001EGE Honky Chateau]],\\" and then perform the two as a medley in concert.  Pete Townsend plays guitar on the peppy opener \\"Town Of Plenty,\\" and the Beach Boys chime in on \\"When God Invented Girls.\\" There are a couple mistakes here; \\"Poor Cow\\" is stupidly misogynistic and I never quite got the atmospheric \\"Japanese Hands.\\"<br /><br />With that in place, this was also the album with one of Elton's best mid-80's hits. His friendship with George Michael had clearly given his pop-sense a jolt of energy. The Wham-like \\"I Don't Wanna Go On With You Like That\\" became his highest charting single of that decade. It was everything his 'recovery' embodied. It is an energetic, sassy and danable record, with an added irony that it was George Michael who held Elton out of the number one position.<br /><br />This was the album where Elton decided to reclaim his personality, as the great Sothby's sell-off of his old gear on the cover shows. He and Bernie set out to craft songs that emphasized their resurgent popularity and succeeded here, and started the third chapter in Elton's illustrious career. The \\"Reg Strikes Back\\" bonus tracks are pretty slim pickens, consisting of one sub-par B-Side and three remixes. Get this because it is Elton's second best 80's album after \\"[[ASIN:B000009EJU Too Low for Zero]],\\" and you'll be satisfied.er \\"[[ASIN:B000009EJU Too Low for Zero]],\\" and you'll be satisfied.

B00006JDVV|2.0|Ok as a typical monster type movie. Effects were great!    I was disappointed in the story line. After viewing all of the trailers, I expected there to be a lot more about the dragons.    I was really looking forward to the sections of the movie where they discover more about the dragons, like their biology, how long have they been around, more science stuff. But it didn't really come.    What you got was a narrator who just dumped all of the interesting facts on you, just to transition you to the end section where they could have the final conflicts.    I enjoy the discovery, where certain characters investigate and after a lot of work they find that final piece of the puzzle that helps them in the end. The process of discovery, picking up on small details that allow your imagination to piece together and fill in the full story. Not just a quick info dump, skip all of the cool stuff, and jump back into the action.    Not that action is bad, in fact I like it best when they intersperse the action scenes with the investigation and discovery scenes.    So I guess it's an Ok Monster Movie, but not great Si-Fi!

B000002542|4.0|Early three works of Journey has been forgotten for decades. Even Journey's early live album CAPTURED has no tracks from early three works before Steve Perry joined the band in 1978. Journey's debut album in 1975 as I mentioned in my NEXT(1977) review, showcases Neal Schon's aggressive guitar. Particularly instrumental tracks such as KOHOUTEK and TOPAZ are dynamic and I want them occasionally on current Journey live. PLAY SOME MUSIC is the most pop song from this album and perhaps Steve Augeri's voice range can allow this nice track on their live. If OF A LIFETIME is played on live Journey fans from the debut will be elated for sure.<br /><br />Verdict: Includes lots of nice tracks and some can even be used on live!<br />Rating: 83 out of 100. Not Journey we know most but still enjoyable.<br />Recommended for: Neal Schon fans and Journey fans essential. 70s progressive fans who like Pink Ployd.
B000LC55F2|3.0|This is a movie about revenge.  Robert Angier and Alfred Borden are two magicians who work together.  When one of them loses a loved one during a performance, the other pursues a lifetime of vengeance.  Back and forth it goes, with the only suspense being who is going to get the last word (or revenge) and destroy the other.  This unrelenting process takes up most of the movie and is really overdone in my estimation.  The  movie is dark, (both the theme and the cinematography) and is pretty despresssing.  My husband and I both enjoyed \\"The Illusionist\\" much more that this movie.
B00005JPQT|4.0|Bruce Willis returns after 12 yrs as John McClane and he's in top form once again. Hackers are murdered and McClane is asked to bring a hacker named Matt Farrell (Justin Long) into custody. Right away McClane finds himself facing bad guys yet again. But that's not the half of it since they can hack into what ever they want and they use that technology to cause havoc in Washington D.C. They also use it to track McClane and control traffic so he has cars coming at him in all directions on top of bad guys shooting at him. So yet again, John McClane is in for one hell of a day.<br /><br />  Despite the plot being a bit silly the film still manages to work on a lot of levels. The action is fantastic even if it can be overly cartoonish and it helps that the effects are excellent as well. Most of all though it's easy to forget how silly the plot is when Bruce Willis is in top form. It also helps that Timothy Olyphant is in good form as the main villian. He's one of my most favorite under-rated actors and he is good here but still I have to say I liked all the main villians in the other films more. He's a cool actor and he trys hard but I still think Alan Rickam, William Sadler and Jeromy Irons were more menacing in the other films. Olyphant still is a worthy addition to that list even if he does come in last.<br /><br />  Justin Long trys hard too but he's no Samuel L. Jackson or Reginald VelJohnson (Family Matters) even. Still though, I admit he gives his best performance since.....playing a Mac. I think if they make a part 5, I'd like to see Taye Diggs play VelJohnson's son who McClane gets stuck teaming up with. This way we could get a cameo from VelJohnson since I actually think his performance was one of the best things about the original film. It's sad that now most people just know of him as the fat guy who Steve Urcle always pissed off lol. So anway I'd like one more film with appearances by Reginald VelJohnson, Bonnie Bedelia and William Atherton but as a retired newsreporter who's now married to McClane's ex wife Holly lol. Anyway from the first trailer I didn't expect much from this film but it delivers more than a lot of the sequels that were released this summer.newsreporter who's now married to McClane's ex wife Holly lol.

B000QFAJ7S|4.0|A lot has been written about the Clarkson vs. Davis fued...and the music is getting forgetten in the trample.  \\"My December\\" is a stunning collection of songs from one of music's most thrilling voices.  Being described as a \\"darker\\" Clarkson, Kelly pours her heart into these tracks and delivers them with a honesty that almost shocking.  American Idol or not, Kelly moves through life the same way most of us do; heartbreak, pain, joy, and closure.  \\"Sober\\", the albums second single is a true masterpiece.  It's subtle production is appealing and it's power rock build may not be radio friendly but is brilliant.  \\"One Minute\\" with it's electro-trash production pulls the listeners ears right to the music.  The album standout track is \\"Mabye\\"--a yearning, powerful, and raw plea for love.      It would have been easy for Kelly to remove herself from the project and deliver another pop savvy album with minimal input.  Sales would have been high and radio would be inundated with songs to fit its friendly formant.  Kelly instead opened herself up and produced a record that she can be truly proud of.  She's mentioned it's her \\"Nebraska\\" (an infamous Springteen record) and much like Madonna's \\"American Life\\" time will treat this project well keeping listeners amazed for years to come.

B000BOH8XW|3.0|I had to listen to ORAL FIXATION VOLUME 2 [after hearing Fijacion Oral Vol. 1] to understand what all the hype was about, for this latest piece by Shakira, and to find out whether it was merited.  What is my verdict?  In all honesty, a lot of the material here left me cold.  Though, I won't deny that Baranquilla-born Colombian superstar extraordinaire Shakira Mebarek is a truly multi-talented vocalist, musician, songwriter, philanthropist and alluring bellydancer, this album felt more like filler than substance.  I was looking forward to seeing how she would fare on her second English language album (the first being LAUNDRY SERVICE in 2001).<br /><br />This 2005 release catches our attention with quite an eyeful of Shakira on the cover.  In fact, the cover art [Shakira in a quasi-Eve pose with forbidden fruit in hand, her chest area barely covered by the branch of the Tree of Knowledge] was generously altered in more fundamentalist nations, prior to the album's release, to conceal her bare midriff.  The music also takes an intimate look at Shakira's life, through a study of the anatomy of broken relationships, evident in her lyrics.  Many of the songs are bitter in nature.  The first song, \\"How Do You Do,\\" examines Shakira's broken relationship with God, specifically.  The lyrics raised eyebrows and generated discussion regarding her [sometimes sacrireligious] view of organized faith practices.  The music and accompanying lyrics are grizzly and pointed.  Shaki even opens the song with excerpts from \\"The Lord's Prayer,\\" in English and Latin, and goes on to sing in Hebrew and Arabic.  Many of the other songs lean more toward her setbacks in romantic love, and the musical styles run the range from pop/rock to disco.  (\\"Don't Bother\\" and \\"The Day and the Time,\\" as examples)  Another controversial song here is \\"Timor,\\" which closes the set of eleven tunes.  Shakira shamelessly calls the media to task, as well as society's apathetic \\"out of sight, out of mind\\" attitude toward the victims of third world country violence and social injustice.  Actually, that is the one track I really connected with.  I love the instrumental on this one, as well as the choral accompaniment.  It's just a shame that this last song didn't set the standard for most of the other tracks on the album.  Then, I would've given this at least four stars.  Give it a listen and draw your own opinions.  Far be it for me to call a \\"yay\\" or \\"nay\\" on this one, so, I will just say that Shakira's latest effort was \\"middle of the road.\\"he victims of third world country violence and social injustice.

630218021X|5.0|Peter Tchaikowsky (1840-1893) is arguably Russia's greatest composer/pianist/conductor.His life was filled with heartache,trauma,emotional instability,near madness,perfectionism and most of all the inability or unwillingness to accept his homosexual nature. His music IS all about emotion. His works triumphantly and tragically are  mirror images of his life, and therefore to understand his life IS to understand his work. Tchaikowsky always searched for love. Upon the unsettling death of his mother from cholera when he was but a child,Tchaikowsky began a decent into melancholy and desperation that would remain and worsen for the rest of his life.Documents reveal his  \\"incestuous affair\\" with his sister Sasha, his hasty/manic marriage to an absolute \\"loon\\" that was disastrous for both of them,an unsuccessful \\"suicide\\" attempt, a brother content to ride on Tchaikowsky's coattails for gain and comfort, and a long standing homosexual relationship with one Count Anton Chilusky in a time when to be homosexual was complete ruination. Through this all, one wealthy widow, Nadia Von Meck, insisted on being his benefactress so that he could devote all of his time to composition \\"for her pleasure.\\" He rose from the bourgeois class. He even received a stipend for life from Czar Alexander.He died tragically and, as later documents uncovered  eight years after this film was made revealed, from something far more sinister and disturbing.    Every bit of this is compelling enough for a film of grand scale, but how to capture the torture and immensity of it all is totally another thing. Ken Russell, as only Ken Russell could do, DID IT, and boy-oh-boy with what flare!!! Ken Russell tells Tchaikowsky's \\"bi-polar\\" and woefully   lamentable struggles by crafting a jolting collage of emotionally beguiling images tied expertly to the composer's music (Evgeny Onegin,The 5th and 6th Symphonies, 1812 Overture and Swan Lake Ballet) in order to ignite the screen in sound,color,pain,euphoria,disgust,triumph and despair.We feel every ounce of pathos; we are repelled by the sight of his wife's bare breasts as she tries to seduce her impotent husband; we are  wooed into the forbidden world of his longing for his  married sister Sasha;we are repulsed by Madame Von Meck's \\"orgasmic\\" reactions to Tchaikowsky's music;we are disgusted at Peter's \\"ne'er-do-well\\" brother Modeste in his attempt to rise along with Peter's fame,but not to share Peter's struggles and woes; and we are troubled by the spurn that Count Chiluvsky feels and his  manipulative ways to convince Peter to come to terms with his own nature.In fact, everyone WANTS And needs Peter Tchaikowsky AND HE DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO WANT OR, NEED THEM!This is the true pain that cries out in Tchaikowsky's compositions and Ken Russell expertly makes us feel and comprehend each raw emotion -almost exhaustingly so!!! Though I try to express my opinions on this film, words,even though I have to use alot of them,STILL ARE TOTALLY INADEQUATE to express the magnitude and depth of this masterpiece!!!    The sheer breadth of what actors Richard Chamberlain and Glenda Jackson produce on screen as Tchaikowsky and his wife Antonina is almost beyond any human comprehension. They must have been totally spent after this film. Rarely is SO much emotion displayed in all of it's ugly rawness.Russell brings out everything that his actors have in order to tell this story so vividly. There is NOT ONE restrained performance in this film. It is an all-out blow-out that brings standing ovations and accolades to all involved.       Andre Previn conducts the London Symphony orchestra. The sound is crystal clear and booming.Chamberlain is a pianist himself, so the \\"finger syncs\\" are perfection!( As a musician,myself, this is always of critical importance!)    One DOES NOT need to know ANYTHING about Peter Tchaikowsky to \\"get\\" this film. To know his life and his music DOES though only enhance all of the nuances that Russell so accurately researched. In fact, this film is SO multi-layered that even over the 37 years since I first saw it there is always something more and something deeper that I understand and see. This is a film to be viewed over and over again for it's story,concept,execution,style and acting. Like Tchaikowsky himself, Ken Russell is a filmmaker's filmmaker. In this film, GENIUS RECOGNIZES GENIUS!!! The viewer is laid emotionally prostrate.     Andre Previn's TCHAIKOWSKY: THE STORY OF THE SYMPHONY is an outstanding documentarian approach to  Tchaikowsky's life and artistry.Previn is an expert on Tchaikowsky and is well respected for his knowledge and interpretation of The Russian Master.      Other companion films that are at the top of their genre concerning classical composers are Ken Russell's MAHLER (Gustav Mahler),BRIDE OF THE WIND (Alma Mahler), AMADEUS (Mozart), IMMORTAL BELOVED (Beethoven), VOICES FROM A LOCKED ROOM (Peter Warlock), SPRING SYMPHONY (Clara and Robert Schumann), ALL THE MORNINGS OF THE WORLD (Colombe and Marais) and to a lesser degree CHOPIN:A DESIRE FOR LOVE (Chopin) and IMPROMPTU (Chopin and Liszt).    Films that discuss intelligently the plight and struggle of homosexuality would be MAURICE, TOTAL ECLIPSE and LOVE IS THE DEVIL.    For skillfully interpreted films that display piano virtuosity I recommend highly THE COMPETITION and SHINE.
1587990717|1.0|The title sounds promising, but this book is a failure.    The main problem is lack or direction. You can read pages and pages without anything interesting popping up. Ocassionaly an interesting point is raised, but you don't get the feeling that the book is leading anywhere, and therefore you don;t feel the compulsion to continue reading it.    Secondly, the author has a very irritating infantile style, peppering the pages with snide remarks or comments about how smart he is.    At the end of the book, you're left feeling that this might have been a vagely interesting three page magazine article, but there is not enough substance to warrant a book.

B000NVT0RU|5.0|Director Rachid Bouchareb made \\"Days of Glory\\" to draw attention to the plight of men from France's protectorates and colonies who served in the French military during World War II but who were denied their pensions after 1959, because their countries had won independence from France. The film is very politically charged in France, where its title is simply \\"Indigenes\\", meaning \\"natives\\". It inspired President Jacques Chirac to finally address the pension inequities. Bouchareb doesn't hide his agenda or his bias: The North African soldiers in the film joined the French army mostly for money, occasionally for opportunity. They fought valiantly and loyally to free France from German occupation. They were stifled by discrimination and quotas during the war and discarded afterward. The specific events and characters in the film are fictional, though some French towns were, indeed, liberated by regiments of mostly North African soldiers.<br /><br />In 1943, France's African Army recruits soldiers from Algeria, among them a young shepherd named Said (Jamel Debbouze), and from \\"goumiers\\" in Morocco, including Yassir (Samy Naceri), who hopes to make enough money for his brother to marry well.  In 1944, the 7th Algerian Infantry Regiment, under the command of French \\"pieds-noir\\" Sergeant Martinez (Bernard Blancan) and Arab Corporal Abdelkader (Sami Bouajila), win France's first victory against the German army in Italy. They arrive in Marseilles to much fanfare, where their marksman Messaoud (Roschdy Zem) begins a relationship with a French woman (Aurelie Bouab). Abdelkader is increasingly frustrated with the lack of promotion and \\"liberte, egalite, and fraternite\\" for African soldiers, inspiring a minor civil rights movement. But the war goes on, and the Regiment will be the first French in Alsace, as they attempt to hold the Germans off until the Americans arrive.<br /><br />\\"Days of Glory\\" won't pack the political punch for Americans that it does for French, but this is a terrific war movie. It tells a World War II story that we haven't seen before, and it features two of the most compelling battle scenes I've ever seen: Flushing the Germans out in mountainous Italy elucidates the fear of the soldiers in their first battle and the utter randomness of who lives or dies. The defense of the Alsacian town is in some ways the opposite, as we know the soldiers well by this time and hope they will survive. The four North African leads represent diverse types: Unsophisticated Said's boyish devotion to his Sergeant, mature Messaoud who is not savvy enough to see the hypocrisy around him, mercenary Yassir whose dedication to his comrades grows, and idealistic Abdelkader who hopes their service to France will advance the position of North Africans. Viewers inevitably sympathize with those most like themselves, but those characters involve us emotionally in the events. In French and Arabic with optional subtitles.<br /><br />The DVD (Weinstein 2007): \\"The Making of Days of Glory\\" (24 min) interviews the director, producer, and writer Olivier Lorelle about researching the film, bringing the story of their ancestors to the screen, and shedding light on the role of North African troops. The cast discusses their preparation and characters. Subtitled. \\"The Colonial Friend\\" (8 min) is an animated film by director Rachid Bouchareb about the experience of Senegalese infantrymen who fought for France and met a worse fate than the North Africans.

B000F3T7R4|5.0|This is my favorite album of Whitesnake of the seventies, Take me with you, Day trippe, this time is right for love.....<br />This album is like a thin lizzy's style, but only in this album!
B000JK8OYU|1.0|Man this is bad - so bad i would rather listen to the Backstreet Boys or Brtiney Spears. But it's the Beatles i hear you cry!!!! You wanna know why i think it's crap - because it adds nothing to their legacy and gives EMI or whoever a chance to make more money of their back catalogue. These mix-ups are not inventive or even vaguely interesting, just a few sound effects here or there. Save some money and buy say a Wings album like London Town or Red Rose Speedway if you need a new Beatles fix.
0765316978|5.0|This book is a terrific wrap up to the series Scalzi started with Old Man's War.  I was happy to see this book return to the viewpoint of John Perry, and I like the writing style much better than that of \\"The Ghost Brigades.\\"  I found a very strong connection with the characters in this book -- something I loved in \\"Old Man's War\\" and found missing from book two.    Scalzi does a terrific job painting his characters' environment, both on the worlds and in the politics of their universe.  He gets a bit carried away with sometimes overly complex wheels-within-wheels-within-wheels plot, but it's never completely over the top.  I also enjoy that he often puts his characters in the position of having to try and find the best choice out of a limited set of poor options.  That's a nice bit of reality instead of other author's trite lines.    Overall I'm awfully happy this turned out to be such a great finish to the series.
B00008BRDX|5.0|No offense to Zenyatta Mondatta, a great album, but that album had some real filler in it (Sting has admitted to this). Reggatta de Blanc is the perfect record all the way through. It has the classic concert #s such as \\"Message in a Bottle\\" and \\"Walking on the Moon.\\" However, this album has so many more quite masterpieces that never seemed to get the attention they deserved, such as \\"Contact\\" and \\"No Time This Time.\\" To each Police fan their own, but for me, this is the greatest album by this great band.

0465043577|3.0|I found Mandelbrots piece is fairly easy to read given the material he is attempting to cover.  It points out the errors of many of the modeling techniques which exist.  I always find this helpful as possibly the most important part of any modeling exercise is to know where your model falls short and what it might not be able to predict.
B0007M22TI|2.0|As many others have commented the bad lip syncing just makes it seem so...well, fake.  As another reviewer commented, it was empty and soulless to me.  It's like they wanted to remove the possibility of making a singing mistake and concentrate all their efforts on looking beautiful.  I want to see performers singing a song not pretending to sing a song.
1400034779|5.0|My mother-in-law gave me this book for Christmas one year.  It's one of those books that you wish wouldn't have to end.:)  I loved it.  It's human enough to be appealing and intelligent enough to be interesting.  By the end of the book I felt like I had made a friend in Precious.:)  I look forward to reading the other books in the series.:)
B000JJRIN4|2.0|I am a huge Gwen Stefani & No Doubt fan but, I must admit that I sat in shocked horror as I listened to this CD for the first time.  I didn't care much for her last CD either, but it sounds like a masterpiece next to \\"The Sweet Escape\\".  I have followed Gwen's career from the beginning and have always loved her bold and confident style, but she is starting to appear insecure and fearful of becoming irrelevant in the ever-changing musical landscape.  \\"The Sweet Escape\\" seems like something she released just to keep her name \\"out there\\" while she focuses on her child & family.  Furthermore, collaborations are great (like \\"Southside\\" with Moby) but, Gwen seems to have gone overboard with too many collaborations with the \\"hot\\" artists/producers of the moment.  It would be nice if \\"The Sweet Escape\\" was a little more \\"Gwen\\" and a lot less outside input which creates a disjointed effect.  I still love you Gwen but, I hope your future musical endeavors are filled with more of the substance and originality you are known for.
B000JJRIN4|3.0|Gwen Stefani's second solo album was not as good as a lot of people like myself thought it would be.  Some of the songs in here doesn't even make sence and she uses anything stupid to make a song like in Breakin' Up.  Some of the songs in this album were written for L.A.M.B but they weren't choosen, no wonder this album is not so good.  The only songs that are good but not great are: Wind it up, The Sweet Escape, Early Winter and 4 in the Morning the rest are mediocre.  If you like Gwen Stefani or some of the new singles give it a try but don't expect a lot from this album.
B00000GAIW|5.0|Luis Mejia (son) - This wasn't the first Jethro Tull album I heard; is really difficult to classify them depending on the album's era you heard, but when I first listened to it I considerated it nice, but not as a masterpiece as I'm telling here. Later, when I heard Thick As A Brick and the compilation Living In The Past, I started comprehending more and more their trayectory. Then I played it again, and how graceful it was to hear it! everything was cleared. This is such a masterpiece, so many aspects to say about it, so many comparisons.<br /><br />Well, for starting the music composition is so incredible, in every song is expressed how they can change with grace from a blues-like face into more progressive rock and more experimentation, 'cause I think of it as progressive rock but there are so many styles in every song that it is difficult to classify, from the soft but firm sounds in Wondering Aloud, Mother Goose and the excellent Wind Up, to the fast, incredibly composed and more enjoyable sounds of Aqualung, Cross Eyed Mary, Up To Me, Locomotive Breath and Hymn 43.<br /><br />The instrumentation is certainly the best one that the band ever had; mainly because they don't exagerate putting songs in a one instrument structure, they just added the sound perfectly, Ian Anderson's flute goes with the rythm of every song, Bare's guitar collaborates equally with all the other instruments, Clive Bunker may be one of the best batterists Jethro ever had, and Hammond organ is a key instrument in most of the tracks, mainly Aqualung, Cross Eyed Mary and Up To Me. Another excellent aspect is that Anderson's voice is at its perfect stage, you'll recognize it if you've heard later and earlier works.<br /><br />When it comes to the album structure, I don't know why they had so much speculations about being a concept album about religion; as I know Anderson denied it and that's why they released Thick As A Brick, for stopping the anxiety about the concept album.<br /><br />In conclussion this is certainly Jethro Tull's best album, I hope they release some day another one like this, apart from Thick As A Brick but I doubt it. The only not-so-good aspect is about the remastered version; not because of the sound sustractions is mainly because they shouldn't ruin such a great album adding such common bonus tracks.y Jethro Tull's best album, I hope they release some day another one like this, apart from Thick As A Brick but I doubt it.

Murphy and the story of 8 other SEALs who jumped to the forefront to get their gun into the fight. Kudos to all these brave young Americans who show there are things worth fighting and dying for. We should honor them all as a grateful nation.
B000B5XOYI|3.0|I had seen 'Batman' awhile back.  I then purchased and watched 'Batman Begins'.  So much for what came before.  I will now give the 'Anthology' to whomever wants it.  Batman Begins is true to the DC comics and, what I would decribe as, more serious.  It is in a way and epic story.  Since this is a review of the 'Anthology', it's OK for what it is.  But what it's not is 'the real deal'.
B000QUEQBS|5.0|This is the best movie I've seen in a long time. It has lots of action, suspense, and has a great story. The picture quality is unbelievably clear and sharp. Overall, a top notch movie.
0307277887|4.0|read the books:).<br /><br />As someone who religiously watched the Showtime series and  recently found out that it's based on a series of books (and am an avid reader as well)  I bought Darkly Dreaming Dexter (the first book) and Dearly Devoted Dexter (the second book) and my husband and I read them back to back. We both loved them.<br /><br />While there are minor differences between series and books I found the differences well done. Lindsey's writing style is so darkly comedic that you'll find yourself unabashedly laughing at Dexter's brand of fun-murder and mayhem.<br /><br /> The whole premise of Dexter being recognized early on and \\"mentored\\" to channel the lust to kill into something good (getting rid of other serial killers) is a fresh and novel approach and works as well in print as on film.<br /><br />The only thing that kept me from giving a 5 star review was the author's habit of constantly having Dexter repeating that he is without human emotion. I think that time would be better spent by either Having Dexter flashback to memories with Harry, his foster father or more Dexter mayhem:)<br /><br />If you love the series you should definitely read this novel, if not the others (though I feel this one is better written than the second). If you are  new to Dexter the TV show and considering catching Season 2, than pick up the book to know what you are getting into:)<br /><br />4.5 stars!
B000LXH0AE|4.0|Stranger Than Fiction brings to the screen the unusual story of a very \\"usual\\" kind of guy.  An IRS agent living a rather uninteresting life for the last 12 years begins hearing a woman's voice narrating his life.  It turns out he might be right...  The plot has elements of both comedy and drama making it rather difficult to label it as one or the other; it's actually a bit of both.  Will Ferrell, Maggie Gyllenhaal (who is GORGEOUS!), Emma Thompson, Dustin Hoffman, and the rest of this AMAZING cast, carry out their respective roles very well.  The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all good.  In a nutshell, though not a masterpiece it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|I think Kelly has successfully shattered the \\"mold\\" that is today's pop star.  This album is emotional, raw, deep and very personal. Kelly deserves great praise for being courageous enough to expose her true self in such a way.  Once again Kelly shines with great vocals. I can't wait until she reschedules her tour so that I can hear these live.
B00000D9TQ|4.0|I didn't want to buy all of Collins's albums, so I bought this.  It's great music to listen to for when you want something relaxing.  I believe this album includes all of Phil's big hits from the 80s/ early 90s.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|I admit I find American Idol to be good tv, but that's about it, and I never did watch the first couple seasons much so I'm not familiar with Kelly's journey to the top. I never bothered to listen to her first album, but a friend lent me her copy of Breakaway and I was impressed enough to get my own. She's a great singer and had some great, catchy stuff on there, good songs and guilty pleasures.   The fuss over this 'My December' album got me curious. She wanted to follow her own course, her instincts, and the bigwigs didn't see a hit and wanted to scrap it, gut it, save it for later? I'm not sure but I liked Clarkson's honesty and boldness, even at the risk of offending people in power.   I actually bought this album after only hearing the 'Never Again' single and reading a few reviews, and I'm not disappointed. There's a lot of variety, a lot of personality here. The lead track and first single 'Never Again' is a bit Alanis, though maybe not quite as mean, but it's good. One Minute has a good, punchy, poppy vibe, and I personally hope that gets a release.   Stuff like Judas, Haunted and more are very thoughtful, and Be Still somehow reminds me a wee bit of Barenaked Ladies (Conventioneers off of the Maroon album), which I adore, since I love BNL. Maybe reminds me of something Sarah McLachlan would sing, and How I Feel has a bit of a new wave vibe, maybe just a pinch of Devo. Yeah has got a bit of R&B sass, and I find Irvine to be totally lovely, heartbreakingly so. There's a lot of variety, perhaps no killer/obvious smash hit, but overall it's impressive stuff, and her voice is beautiful when she's singing softly, plaintively in stuff like Irvine. Other people with other tastes are going to find a lot of other influences here, which is part of the fun. Clarkson's really growing and it shows she is taking her craft seriously.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This set is amazing! The only thing I wish that was different is that you could get all the non song parts too. Other than that, the songs are wonderful, the music is amazing, and I've learned all the words!
B00005JPHT|5.0|In this movie Moore returns to his \\"Roger And Me\\" roots of standing up for the \\"little guy\\" against the heartless financial interests of big corporations. But it is also his most mature movie, leaving aside all the wacky pranks and celebrity cheap shots to focus on our failed system of health care and the tragic results this creates for so many American citizens.<br /><br />The movie starts out with several personal stories of folks left in the lurch either through their lack of medical insurance or the lack of coverage provided by their insurance company. It then offers a brief history of U.S. government policy related to health care and how politicians and big money insurance companies have conspired to keep our failed system in place.<br /><br />But the film really catches fire when it begins to travel overseas - to Canada, England, France and Cuba - to show how other countries have created successful programs of free national care without the horrors of \\"socialized medicine\\" that right-wing propagandists like to ascribe to them. It's a tragedy and an embarassment that the United States of America, the wealthiest and most powerful nation in the history of humankind, is also the only modernized Western country to not have a system of national health care. This movie shows why we can and must do better!
B000002KIE|5.0|Give me some of that pure Rock 'n' Roll sound!<br />This is the only 'true'Sex Pistols album and really the only one you need.<br />Considered by many to be one of the front-runners of punk, but I do believe Iggy Pop and The (Mighty) Stooges did Punk better. Having said that,this has been one of my first punk albums at the tender age of 11 and it instantly opened my ears to a whole new sound of Rock that I never realized existed.<br />Immediately I could feel the Raw intensity of Johnny Rotten's maniacal voice, snotty, in your face type of attitude bleeds through the speakers from the Wildman that is Rotten himself. One of the first songs - \\"Bodies\\" is a perfect example of the pure punk attitude I am referring to - Animalistic fury. Screaming bloody mess! Real Brit Punk, heck Real punk period, out of 1977.<br />  There have been many imitators since The Pistols, but why not pick up the original, in all it's aggressive devestating glory (?)<br /><br />I don't think I ever heard a debut punk record as good as this. They just don't exist, but yes, this album here did help me on my search for real punk and DIY type bands.<br />Highlights of mine are \\"Bodies\\" - \\"God Save the Queen\\" - \\"Pretty Vacant\\" & of course the song that the band is known for \\"Anarchy In the U.K.\\"- Turn it Up, Loud! (the way it's meant to be heard)<br />...Forget The Clash, sure they were a great band, but if Anarchy had a voice it would be Johnny Rotten's.

0374105235|5.0|after watching blood diamond which brought me to tears more than once, it was a little strange to read this book from an actual child soldier who does not seem the least bit angry. The journey of the boy is so moving forward and full of hope that at least he will be better now.  I'm glad he was able to write this book and let attention be focused on one of the multiple troubles that Africa is facing.
B000002GJS|4.0|this is a great rock n roll album. It is a departure from the other bryan adams' stuff i have. It has more rock ballads and out and out rock
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I had never really considered the direct impact we have on this planet and its other inhabitants before I saw this series.  I am in awe of our planet after watching this amazing series and have convinced others to purchase this.  The cinematography and photography is beautiful and moving.  Enough of the gush but I can not stress how this has changed my thinking - species are at risk every day because of changes to our environment, many of which we can control.  I would highly recommend this to anyone - the younger the better!
0156027321|3.0|After casting around for some summer reading I grabbed this one and another from the best selling list, assuming the great mass of numbers buying it up meant something. Unfortunately it meant very little :(    Without going into a synopsis of the plot (see above for that) my feelings are the book was just *barely* worth the $9 and given the choice I'd rather get it from the library. Teased with reviews saying it would change my life or make me believe in God it only managed to provide a day and a half of well turned phrases. While occasionally quirky and clever I found the beginning slow and pedantic.     Perhaps the symbolism -- obscure at times -- was crystal clear to those who rave about this book and they connected all the dots in their own heads. But for me...well I guess I still have to wait on Harry Potter
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|this is one great cd..........i loved the kelly took it up a few, she needed to step out of the bubble gum pop, and still keep it real.......i loved this cd from the first lission. it will be big, all the people on here who dont like it now, will after it gets lost and lots of air play. some of the most outstanding tracks, one minute, dont waste your time, judas, how i feel......outstanding. the more you lission to these tracks , the more pop they sound. i could have done without track 7 haunted and 8 be still. all in all, very good. if you love kelly, dont lission to those other bad reviews on here....those people are gonna eat there words....it has grammy written all over it, lots of top 10 hits...my fav track...track 10, its great, hats off kelly, i am glad you did what you had to do. should she take it more rock next cd......no. but i say, buy it, your gonna love it. kelly, you go girl.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Ten years out, I think we have sufficient historical perspective to fairly evaluate this album.      Honestly, it seems to me there are things about \\"OK Computer\\" that one might do differently given the chance to change it.  That being said, when has rock music risen higher than this?  When has anyone made an album that inspires, frightens, and intrigues more than this record?  I am interested to hear suggestions, but at the end of the day I think this is probably THE pinnacle for popular music during my lifetime (1970 to the present).  Accordingly, I give it 5/5 stars, and consider it more favorably than anything else I am aware of.  I am at a loss to understand how anyone else could fairly rate it any lower than 5/5.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|Much has been made of Kelly Clarkson's change of direction on her third album. The heavier tracks and darker themes are surprisingly effective. With a hard-fought songwriting credit on every track, this is pure Clarkson. By laying her soul bare on relationships, suicide, betrayal and more, My December evokes memories of Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill. It is the album Clarkson had to make and establishes her as an all-round package and musical force to be reckoned with. - JAMES WIGNEY<br />BEST BIT: Clarkson's versatility and ability to convincingly turn that extraordinary voice to a wide range of styles.<br />WORST BIT: It may disappoint old fans.<br />VERDICT: Five stars
B000Q6GUTI|5.0|I might be bias on this because I know and shoot with former Marine sniper, Pat Garrity, who was a military technical advisor and did the stand-ins for Wahlberg in the shooting scenes.  (he also runs a shooting school for precision rifle)    I found the plot interesting and the movie a real thriller.  It is a movie worth watching and/or purchasing (I don't go to the movies much, let alone buy a DVD, but this one I did).    Enjoy, it's entertainment.
0307276902|5.0|You HAVE to read this book!! Dont let all the negative crap stop you from this unbelievable book!! This is an excerpt that I have just written to Oprah:    Unbelievable!! I have watched you since day 1 and I have just read something that has made me loose all respect and you being my idol ceased!! I just saw the class action suit about The Million Little Pieces. How dare you do that to him!!! First off - he was not ALLOWED to tell real names and betray confidentiality of anyone in the AA or rehabs he was in so of course he would have to change names. He was on severe drugs so I am sure his facts and realities are distorted. All because he didnt but a disclaimer that some names and events have been changed, you decided to jump on the smoking gun bandwagon and throw him to the wolves!!! You arent what we see on TV!! Fake eyelashes, all make-up, a trainer, so should we all file a class action suit against you???? My blood boiled when I saw how you treated that man on the \\"outed\\" show but has now boiled over!! Never in all these years have I been upset enough to write!!! Very DISAPPOINTED!!!!!
B000NVIXFK|3.0|It's frustrating that on the other side of 50 years old these guy's still rock musically but they ruin the great music with this same whiny Pop lyric/vocal delivery formula they've been using for several years now. I think it's time for some outside influence in the writing department. And I don't mean anyone like those pop sellout scumbags Desmond Child or Bob Rock. I know bands grow and evolve over the years but don't kid yourself they're in a rut. Just listen to the first album  \\"Rush\\" Neil Peart wasn't even in the band then and that's just a straight up rock album. And Neil's songwriting in the earlier days had a lot more imagination to it. I don't know if the loss of family members is responsible for this change over the last few years but maybe it's time to call it a day. I think that it's time Alex's side project Victor with Edwin of I Mother Earth maybe have another go. Their first effort was excellent. And Geddy's solo disc although Rush-sounding (A singer has a hard time breaking away from that comparison) was also excellent. I know this review will not be popular with the Sheep who are just so glad to have a new Rush CD they can't be honest with themselves about the quality. But I mean \\"Come On\\" Rush and their kids and their kids and their kids and their kids and their kids and so-on can't spend all the money they've made so why keep putting out pop music.
B0000VD04M|5.0|Landau made this film what it was for me.  The supporting cast was great as well, but Landau was absorbed into his role as Bela Lugosi.  Just a masterful work he did.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|2nd disc since Dave Ellefson left the band and Mr. Mustaine seems to want to back in time musically and blend it with it with bits of the present. And I like it!!  I also like Dave E's F5 project although it sounds a lot like Sevendust but that's OK cause I like them too. It cracks me up to read the hater reviews. If you're a true Megadeth fan you roll with the changes in their music. At least their not turning their hat sideways and screaming Yo , Yo , Yo , Look At Me! Instead they're still giving you rocking tunes with scorching solos. Do you get that from Lympsync Bizketstreet Boys or Puddle Of Poop? The fact is that eventhough being pushed aside by the crap that MTV has the kiddies buying the Metal bands from the 80's and 90's are still bringing it!
B00007AJF8|5.0|A great original film which shows the potential once again of an independent production.  The photography and the writing were exceptionally well done.  I've revisited this film at least 10 times.
B000OY8NII|5.0|This show is really something that the television world can be proud of. It's something new with some great characters, interesting story lines that have you up and down every minute not to mention the creative angle of the show. The acting is incredible. SciFi took a great leap for television kind with Eureka. 2 thumbs all the way up!
B000M4RG42|3.0|I'm a little bit of a history buff and like to watch movies about different periods of history to learn a little bit.  I was disappointed with this movie.  Seemed like we were bouncing around a little too much and it was hard to track events and people.  In the end, I felt the movie was more about Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome than about Iwo Jima or the war.<br /><br />I would probably pass on this one and watch something else, unless you are really curious about it.
1596912855|1.0|Austenlands is a book that just doesn't quite work. You don't believe the heroine.  You don't believe the story.  You don't believe the ending. And you want to.  It was disappointing and I was happy to see it end. There are so many great Austen-related titles (Letters From Pemberley, The Jane Austen Book Club, Old Friends and New Fancies)...this was really a disappointment.
B000J103PC|3.0|Overall, this is a pretty good film, with Anne Hathaway as Andy Sachs, the recent college grad trying to break into journalism who takes the only available job as junior assistant to the high-powered editor of the leading fashion magazine. She's earnest, and cute, and bright -- but Meryl Streep as Miranda Priestly, queen of fashionistas and priestess of the Dark Side of the Force, is spectacular. As the tagline says, Miranda is \\"hell on wheels.\\" Sadistic, hyper-demanding, not knowing when to quit, lacking in the most basic humanity, willing to blow another marriage, happy to sacrifice everything and everyone around her, convinced that no one else in the universe is capable of doing her job. And yet \\"a million girls would kill\\" for Andy's job. It takes awhile, but Andy eventually (of course) discovers she's becoming too much like Miranda and manages to save herself at the last minute. It's a little too pat, but I enjoy watching the fashion industry being skewered.
6305308659|2.0|All the positive comments from folks on this blatantly propagandistic film reflect their relief that those bad old 1950s (of which they know virtually nothing) are gone and targeted for terminal mockery, since things are so much better now, what with one out of five babies aborted, a majority of children born out of wedlock, and drug abuse and violence the major concerns of high-school-age kids, instead of all the poodle skirts and silliness of Pleasantville.<br /><br />Wake up and smell the Prozac, lemmings: Technicolor-land is worse than Pleasantville, and no amount of clever revisionism is going to change it.<br /><br />This film is a mendacious little piece of half-ignorant fantasy, and thus nearly perfect entertainment for most contemporary movie-goers, who can't even find Asia on a map, and had to have the SAT dumbed-down to jumpstart their self-esteem.
B000MV9026|5.0|I really like this movie for the simple fact of what it was trying to convey; Somehow, the penguins could sing, but poor Mumble, couldn't. I like it when his mother kept on being there for him no matter what. But what I like is the fact that they had this whole darn chior, but this ONE little fella couldn't sing to save his life if he could. Very interesting movie.
1582701709|4.0|If you haven't seen the DVD, this is a great motivational book to read. Even if you have seen the DVD, the book provides a review of the material covered in the film and is great for bookmarking helpful passages. I own the movie and the book and I love to reread certain passages and quotes instead of watching the whole DVD again.
0316018953|4.0|I am a Harry Bosch fan.  This effort which is described in other reviews is a pleasant read.  It is shorter and less compelling than a normal Michael Connelly story.  Because it is so short we do not have the time to develop the characters.  I hope that this short effort does not mean that we have to wait another year to get another Connelly.
B0000C5RQF|5.0|What a magnificent production. The acting is good, overall.  Roschmann is appealing in her \\"little girl\\" way.  Her voice is tender and warm.  I remember a few of Edith Mathis' performances in Hamburg. Damrau is note-perfect and icy as the Queen of the Night.  (The make-up is awesome)  It's hard to believe that she could also play Zerbinetta in \\"Ariadne\\".  Keenlyside is to fall in love with for his doofy, portrayal of Papageno.  Besides the beauty of his baritone, the sheer physicality of his acting brings a lot to this portrayal.  The \\"Red Green\\" costume has to appeal to us North Americans.  Will Haman brought out the immature and fallible side of Tamino and gained in dignity in a very believable way (as it should be)  His voice is not the most beautiful Tamino I have ever heard, but I thought he was quite good.  I thought the Sorastro (Selig?) was OK - unfortunately I remember Kurt Moll from Hamburg and also Mati Talvela who were \\"Jahrhundertstimmen.\\"  Nonetheless good.  I bought this recording for myself after getting it on Netflix for my AP German students, but gave it to one of my graduating students as a present.  I will have to get another.
B00008WJBU|5.0|I didn't mind the subtitles at all, for this movie has a great deal going on and you are soon submerged in the story. A man who survived a Nazi concentration camp believes good and bad luck can be 'transferred'. He runs a casino where luck is vital to the players and many often have 'high stakes' in some bizarre games played behind closed doors. For some, it appears they do have extraordinary 'luck', but can life's events really be that simple? I was very surprised by the ending and it prompted a long discussion between my husband and myself as to whether good luck actually exists for some and not others.<br /><br />Chrissy K.

B0007OY2P8|3.0|How could someone have all the right equipment to make a movie and fail to deliver?  Wrong combinations of costume, sound and film kept this from being a success.  The castle would have been interesting to see if the filming had picked up the details of the furniture and the outdoor scenes. The Roman bath was an unusual attraction for the film but you could not see it very clear.  The hot springs were a good site also but the color was so drab that the lake was unattractive instead of beautiful to look at.      Low budgets must have put the filming at risk and they had to offset it all with bad sound, improper costume coordination (or lack of)and direction of the film in general.    If these problems had been addressed the movie would have easily gotten five stars from me.    However, it was like \\"Gone With The Wind\\" compared to \\"Persuasion\\" by BBC.    Five stars for ALL of the performers, though.
1597371416|5.0|This CD is wonderful.  Sometimes you get a cd that you don't like the narrator on.  Not in this case.  It's great.  It is also the second set I've bought.  One of my discs from the last set cracked (under strain from small children) and I couldn't live without it.  As anyone who loves Jane Austen and her \\"Pride and Prejudice\\".
B00003CXI1|5.0|Chris Columbus directed \\"Young Sherlock Holmes\\". If you saw that movie, you would not be surprised at Harry Potter.  He puts all the visual stage elements that it takes to mesmerize audiences.  The book is not able to give this clear picture. You must have a producer who can nail it on the head to make it in the film industry.     The color, costumes, makeup, stage design, and everything all the way down to the wire was perfected to make sure this movie had a lasting effect on the audience.  Hats off to the author for the creation, but definitely to the produccer for bringing it to life on film.
1596912855|4.0|Jane Hayes is just your average, thirty-something, single New Yorker except for one little thing...her obsession with Pride and Prejudice, particularly with Mr. Darcy (as portrayed by Colin Firth, of course!), is ruining her life. No living, breathing, real man can compare to Darcy, the epitome of Regency-era male perfection. And so a succession of relationships crashes and burns, and Jane secretly watches her P&P DVDs, and then hides them like contraband from others when they visit her apartment, just in case they should see them and guess at her grand obsession (and correspondingly pathetic lack of a love life).<br /><br />Then Jane's Aunt Carolyn dies and leaves her an unexpected and intriguing bequest in her will -- a three week stay at a role-playing resort in England called Austenland, a complete immersion into Austen's world for obsessed fanatics such as Jane. Seizing the opportunity to lay her Darcy fantasies to rest forever so she can live for something real, Jane accepts the trip and and heads to Austenland to live as Miss Jane Erstwhile, circa 1816, for three weeks. Jane's resolve to put her Darcy-esque fantasies behind her forever is sorely tested when confronted with the reality of the handsome, cravat-wearing gentlemen who populate Austenland and pay court to female guests. In the ultimate Austen-lover's fantasy world, can Jane find something real?<br /><br />I so enjoyed this book. Hale's novel is a witty, clever send-up of the rabid Austen / Darcy mania that just about every woman I know can relate to in some degree. I would have liked to have seen the novel written in first-person from Jane's point-of-view -- the concept just screams \\"chick lit\\" and a change from third- to first-person would have enabled Hale to give greater insight and depth to Jane's character and smoothed out the narrative a bit. The supporting cast of characters that people Austenland is fabulous, though slightly underdeveloped. At a mere 194 pages, Austenland is an extremely short, fast read that begs to be about 100 pages longer (at least). I loved the world Hale created, and I loved Jane (I can SO relate to her Darcy mania!) and a certain someone that she meets at Austenland -- I won't spoil the surprise for those of you reading the review by naming names, even though when you read the novel Jane's real-life \\"Darcy\\" is telegraphed VERY early on. However, this lack of suspense doesn't detract from the sheer enjoyability of the read. I just wish there was more of it. Primarily known as a young adult fantasy author ([[ASIN:1582349908 The Goose Girl]], [[ASIN:1582349061 Enna Burning]]) Hale is a promising voice in funny, clever, chick-lit style novels and I look forward to reading more from her. Austenland is a perfect summer read -- what it may lack in substance it more than compensates for in wit and invention.that begs to be about 100 pages longer (at least).

0385335997|5.0|Okay, for me this series started as a glorified romance novel, but has stretched into so many new directions, it would be a shame to simply classify it as such. More action/adventure than anything else, this third outing finds Claire eventually back in time with Jamie, climaxing in an adventure in the West Indies involving black magic, kidnapping, and murder. I thought it was great. And at over a thousand pages, that's a feat.
0385340559|5.0|As mysteries go this is up there with the best. Maybe even an award winner for 2007. I'll save you from spoilers just by telling you this is well worth the effort with only one horrible problem - If they gave awards for the worst title of the year \\"Bad Luck and Trouble is the hands down winner.<br /><br />Don't let the title put you off, read it, be entertained by the great storytelling, characters and brilliant plotting.
B000OYC3J8|4.0|For the fans (like myself) who didn't REALLY get into the The White Stripes until Get Behind Me Satan came along, Icky Thump is worth the price of the ticket. They are still experimenting here but more than a few tracks stick to the old WS recipe. Not a bad thing but I'd like to hear some more of what they have to offer, which I can sense there's alot more that we've seen in glimpses from the past few albums.<br />My only real gripe with Icky Thump starts right off the bat with the title track when you get smacked with their shortsighted views of illegal immigration:<br /><br />White Americans, what?<br />Nothing better to do?<br />Why don't you kick yourself out<br />you're an immigrant too.<br /><br />Who's using who?<br />What should we do?<br />Well, you can't be pimp<br />and a prostitute too.<br /><br />Not insightful, and not a relevant argument. They obviously don't live with the difficult realities many Americans face with the complex and harsh effects of illegal immigration. Disappointed that they had to do that to such a catchy, thumping tune. But anyways, if you can get around the goofy political views it's still an overall very good album.
B000ETRCMQ|5.0|Huffmann (the frumpy housewife on desperate housewives) shines as a gender challenged patient.  See this movie for a Tour De France of acting!!!
0800141660|5.0|Anyone watching this show can determine how hard it was for a woman to survive in the pre-industrial England.    I have a preference for 19th century movies and books. This movie did not disappoint me. The actors and actresses all fit so perfectly into their roles. It was like magic to see them perform.     The Dashwood women, Elinor, Marianne and Margaret with along with their mother are forced to leave a life of luxury when Mr. Dashwood dies and they move into a cottage in the country. (Women have no rights to inherit when a man dies.) The money usually is given to the eldest sons in the family. The women must find another means to survive unless the one who inherits is generous enough to allow them to stay on. In this case, the greed of the son's wife overrules the son and the women are pressed upon to leave very quickly.     The oldest daughter develops a romantic interest in her half brother's wife's brother-in-law, but the sister-in-law makes certain that they are separated so that nothing more can develop.     The younger of the two oldest daughters abandons sensible conduct and rushes headlong into folly with a rake.     The two sisters are then taken into London for a season, and the truth is known about both men on their lives. One is already secretly engaged (entrapped is more like it)and the other has proposed to a wealthy woman because of his own bad debts.     Everything works out for the best and everyone gets what they deserve in the end. Life doesn't always look like it works that way, but it probably does. At least this movie inspires me to believe it.     The music in it is outstanding along with all of the beautiful panoramic scenery of England's countryside.
B00005JPQU|5.0|It was worth the wait. Much-awaited, action-packed \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" (also known as \\"Die Hard 4.0\\") lives up to our expectation with non-stop action sequences and snappy dialogues. But the most impressive is of course Bruce Willis and his character, NYPD detective John McClane, whose latest job \\"to just pick up a kid in New Jersey and drive him down to D.C.\\" turns out a much more difficult one than he thinks.    The film's nice idea is to pit a veteran NYPD cop against a group of cyber terrorists. Maybe I should not reveal too much here, but the fourth \\"Die Hard\\" film has something to do with the worst scenario of cyber terrorism in USA. If one man can stop that, it must be McClane, whose job is to save the good and kill the bad. The tough cop has to survive the attacks not only from a helicopter but from a military jet fighter and high-kicking kung-fu fighter. This sounds like a bad joke, but it really works.    In fact, I was pleasantly surprised to see the great action sequences by director Len Wiseman, who avoids his MTV-like, heavily stylistic photography he used for \\"Underworld,\\" but he instead shows more orthodox action storytelling that reminds us of John McTiernan who helmed the first and third \\"Die Hard\\" films. Moreover, those actins come with a healthy dose of humor, the same kind that made his character very popular and likable in the previous films.    Bruce Willis may not be the most skillful or versatile actor in Hollywood, but he surely has charisma, and his commanding presence as John McClane, a nice, tough guy,  makes up for the numerous plot holes and preposterous episodes. Also impressive is the supporting cast, which includes Justin Long, Timothy Oliphant, Cliff Curtis, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Maggie Q, who is much better than in \\"MI3\\" with her martial arts skills. Kevin Smith appears as \\"Warlock\\" with several amusing references to \\"Star Wars.\\"    In short John McClane comes back. Slick and fast-paced \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" is a thrilling and exciting action film, great 130 minute roller coaster ride.
B00005ARDC|4.0|Definitely very catchy with some excellent tracks. Very listenable indie style recording, dark in places, energetic in others. There seems to be some very heavy voice dubbing on their recordings, since they sound like Jerry Lewis when they sing live - very high pitched, whiny voices compared to the recordings. They just need some testosterone shots or to stop dubbing the recordings so much...
B000JK8OYU|4.0|AMAZING THAT ANYBODY WROTE A BAD REVIEW.  I'VE BEEN COLLECTING BOOTLEGS FOR YEARS AND WAS AMAZED THAT SOME OF THEM WERE INSERTED ON THIS CD - SOUNDING CLEAN AND FRESH. THE BLENDING OF SONGS WAS FANTASTIC AND KEPT ME SMILING THROUGHOUT, NOT KNOWING WHAT WAS COMING NEXT. I ONLY WISHED THE DRUMBEAT CARRIED ALL THE WAY THROUGH ON TRACK 14, BUT WAS STILL GIGGLING ON HOW COOL IT WAS. ONLY 4 OF 5 STARS   CAUSE I WISH ALL BEATLES SONGS WERE ON THIS (MAYBE/HOPEFULLY VOL. 2)  THOSE WHO DIDN'T LIKE THIS CD SHOULD LISTEN WITH THEIR HEADS PULLED OUT OF THEIR A**.
B000H2AH9K|5.0|At first, I though that Bradbury's discription of Martian life was kind of simplistic... just Earth things in a different color.  However, as different entrees of the martian chronicles indicated, martian life was more advanced than I had realized.      The overall plot of the book does not seem to make sense until the reader realizes that each segment is a mini-story.  BUT in the end, all of the stories are connected, but just in minor ways.    Each of Bradbury's little stories has a different \\"flavor\\" to them.  Some of them are even creepy.  Reading this book at night gave a me a rush on a few occasions.  Its not too bad though.    I really thought it was interesting to see what the view of technology of the new millenium in 1950. Just a nice thought.

B00064AM6C|3.0|The herky-jerky grainy thing really bothers me:  Meg looks like a white blob with arms.  Even the Beastie Boys' \\"Awesome...\\"--which had many reaching for the Gravol--wasn't as bad as I had been told, given that it took the occasional breather and offered up a clear, well-composed static shot.  Rather than being indie, hip, or uncompromising, the visualization approach taken here seems merely lazy and thoughtless.  Still waiting for the video collection...
B000M4RG42|2.0|I like war films like Saving Private Ryan and Pearl Harbor, but I found this film depressing, hopeless (\\"everything is a lie!\\") and downright boring. It seems interesting but after a while you just feel aweful about your own country and feel fooled. I love you Clint but you should have just changed directions of the film from the beginning
0757302661|4.0|My mom found an old copy of a Hypnobirthing book at a yard sale.  Halfway through I was thinking, \\"Wow...I really wish this had a relaxation CD to go with it!\\"  Found this book and bought it immediately.      I didn't want to fork over the cash for a Hypnobirthing class, and I think this book+CD will be a suitable substitute.  After all, there are several things in the book that are a little strange (the rainbow deal?  weird.), so I probably would have been disappointed with the class anyway.  With this book, I can get a thorough introduction to the concept of Hypnobirthing (very basically, relaxation = less pain), some visualization ideas, and a very relaxing CD to take into the delivery room with me.  I plan to pop the CD in my discman, slip the headphones on, and basically ignore everyone else in the room until the baby is born. :)    I'm due in 6 more weeks...I'll try to remember to update this review after delivery to let y'all know how it worked. :)    ETA: Well, I didn't end up listening to the CD during labor, because I didn't feel I needed it.  The breathing alone really helped relax me.  My contractions were totally manageable the whole time.  Not pain free, but nowhere near excruciating.  Transition was a little rougher, but still manageable.  However, the \\"birth breathing\\" didn't work for me.  It wasn't effective enough to get my baby out.  But it did move him down far enough that I only had to give 3 or 4 \\"purple pushes\\" to finish the job (and he was 9lbs!).  Overall, this delivery was MUCH faster and easier than my first, and much less traumatic.  I would still recommend this book and CD to any pregnant woman.
B000PHX4VA|3.0|This collection was much needed, not only to introduce a new generation of fans to the Police's music as they reform and tour this summer but also to have an anthology that would stay in print, remastered for the ages, that summed up the \\"definitive\\" tracks for the iPod generation. The previous comps were severely lacking.  The thing that gets me is that 2 tracks were left off this collection that would make it truly definitive, 2 tracks that most areas of the country still hear on rock radio and needed to be included to declare this collection the ultimate Police summation. I'm referring to \\"Peanuts\\", from Outlandos d'Amour and \\"When The World Is Winding Down, You Make The Best Of What's Still Around\\" from Zenyatta Mondatta. These are essential Police cuts and are familiar to even the most casual Police fans. The frustrating part is that they could have been included without sacrificing any of the songs on the collection! Sure, it's a little heavy on the 1st and last disc (with good reason), but there is more than enough room to have 15 songs on each CD, even 16 or 17! \\"Rehumanize Yourself\\"! \\"Bed's Too Big..\\"! \\"Shadows In The Rain\\"! Also missing....not as essential, but why? To leave room for another collection down the line? Without a doubt, When the World... is not only one of their most famous songs but one of their best. I can't believe they didn't get it right with 2 CDs to work with! Thing is, I've made a 1 CD Police mix for the car and was able to usually fit AT THE MINIMUM 18 songs on it, even using different tracks! If that were done here, this would have been a 5 star review. Oh well, there's always next time, right? Dig deeper, people!!! 5 stars for the music, 1 star for the short length and exclusions. I'm sorry to give this collection any less than the 5 stars it deserves but it's a waste and a shame. Congratulations to the Police for the successful reformation!
0875847706|5.0|I seldom read a book more than once but this is an exception.  I've read The Art of Possibility once a year since first reading it and come away with something new each time.  The best of coaching and positive psychology, this book is inspirational.  If you don't come away smiling and looking forward to getting up in the morning, check your pulse! I recently gave copies to four graduates of an Executive MBA program who raved about the book.  The Art of Possibiity should be required reading for high school students, in fact, for everyone!
B000M5AJQS|4.0|The Departed was good. But it was not the \\"best film\\" (that goes to Babel). But the acting was good and it was a fun movie to watch. Very gory and the ending is something shocking, but I liked it overall
0786939532|5.0|When I first discovered the wonderful world of Salvatore, I was in the bookstore, staring at the large, beautiful cover of Sojourn. I than immediantly went and picked up the original cover edictions of The Crystal Shard - The Halfing's Gem. I fell in love with the series, and also picked up Homeland - Sojourn, along with The Thousand Orcs - The Two Swords, (skipping past most of the series, which I somewhat regret now) and read all of them. The Hunter's Blade Trilogy was a disapointment, the plot seemed to drag somewhat, and I found that Salvatore seemed to be losing that magical touch he possed in early novels. Nevetheless, the trilogy was a fun read, and I'm looking forward to Transitions (The Orc King, The Pirate King, and The Ghost King), and maybe the series will come to a nice close.<br />The Crystal Shard - The Halfing's Gem was fantastic! My favorite being The Halfing's Gem, and the wonderful battle scene at the end. I have yet to go ahead and read Legacy, and the rest of The Legend of Drizzt series.<br />When I picked up Homeland, I especially loved the cover. Throughout my 7th - 11th grade of reading epic fantasy novels, few had the appeal to keep me reading the series. Dragonlance: Chronicles/Legends/Second Generation & Dragons of a Summer Flame/The War of Souls were nice, but later on the series got a little dry and stale. I missed the original Hero's of the Lance, especialy my favorite Raistlin Majere. Even though he appeared breifly and made his peace with his older brother, Caramon, the series seemed to come to an uncertain halt.<br />While Homeland is my favorite of the series, I loved Drizzt Do'Urden journey into the Underdark, and his training he received from the drow and his father, Zaknafein Do'Urden. The Dark Elf Trilogy will keep you reading long into the night, and you won't be disapointed with any of the books. Even though Sojourn can be boring at parts, it makes it's point. Drizzt found a place to defend and stay forever...
0345350472|5.0|When I saw Blade Runner for the first time I realized that I had just seen something that was original, smart and that related to me in many, many ways.    I found out that it was loosely based on the book, \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\" and decided that if the movie is as good as it is and it's a condensed version of the story in the book, than the book should be just as good, if not better.    I ordered it from Amazon and started reading. I was only a few pages in when I realized just how \\"loosely\\" the movie was based on the book. The book was an entirely different experience.    This book is filled with compelling drama, deception, sci-fi, and 1940's crime-noir style storytelling (complete with the classic femme-fatal) and it does not dissapoint.    Sure, you already paid to see the movie, and you might be thinking, \\"Why would I pay to read the same story?\\" You aren't. You will be pleased with this book emensely - it's a completely different story.
1416914285|4.0|This was a really good book. I had come across it by chance in a bookstore i was just looking for something to read on my plane ride and i read the cover and found it very interesting. This book kept me glued page after page and my plane ride went buy in a blurr. I was rather put off by the fact that clarry and Jace were brother and sister. that kinda grossed me out but other then that it was actually a good book.
B00005JPKE|3.0|No one can deny that Clint Eastwood is a good filmaker. But all of his films are so dark (literally and figuratevly) that it kind of bores me. LfIG was no different. It was an \\"inspirational\\" film that did make you think and makes a good discussion to have with your father, but I found it way too slow. It was relatively long and they were in a cave most of the time. It was okay but in the end, I say it was too long and boring. But good acting and writing and directing
0385338694|3.0|The Undomestic Goddess is about a young brilliant overworked lawyer who makes a huge \\"mistake\\" (at least she thinks so) and is promptly fired from her job.  She then ends up as the housekeeper for extremely rich clueless owners- even though she doesn't know how to use a vacuum let alone how to cook.  Soon enough she gets the hang of things (with the help of the uber-hot gardener) and is loving her life as a housekeeper.  So when her old high-paying job comes around calling what is an undomesticated goddess to do?    This book was a fun, fluffy predicatble romp that was midly engaging and kept me wanting to read it- if only for its laugh out load, over the top humor.  While I could tell exactly what would happen before I was even halfway through the book, that didn't make this book any less funny or enjoyable.   This was overall a silly, enjoyable book- with a sweet if ridiculous plot and message, and larger then life characters.  If you want a beach read where you won't have to think then you might want to give it a try, though there wasn't anything ridiculously special about this book.  If you're looking for something remotely deep skip it.
1932907009|5.0|This is my favorite book on screenwriting (tied for first with Robert McKee's \\"Story\\") but it is not for every writer.<br /><br />I tend to be a perfectionist who dwells on writing projects forever, rarely finishing them. I needed Snyder's approach, which is that screenwriting is less about art and more about craft. If you are willing to give the audience what they want, he can tell you how.<br /><br />If you are trying to write a fragmented, socially deep film such as Crash, Traffic, or Babel, this is not the book for you. If you love pop movies, whether they are family comedies such as Freaky Friday, or action hits like the Die Hard series, or popcorn blockbusters such as the Matrix and Men in Black, Snyder will rock your world and put your writing on the fast track.<br /><br />The two greatest aspects of the book are: 1) Snyder's approach to genre. If I tell you my movie is \\"a Western,\\" you still don't know what kind of story I'm telling. Snyder has invented his own 10 genres based on what kind of story you are telling: Buddy Love, Rite of Passage, Dude with a Problem, Monster in the House, and so on. Knowing what kind of story you are really writing makes it MUCH easier to make story choices.<br />2) Blake Snyder's Beat Sheet. Snyder has identified 15 story points, or beats, that appear in virutally every satisfying movie, ranging from Chinatown to Elf. When you begin a writing project with a bunch of cool ideas for scenes, you often can't figure out what order they belong in. The Beat Sheet helps you figure out FAST where they should go, plus what you're missing.<br /><br />I worked on a project about a high-tech heist for two years, and stalled out. Following the book's guidance a year later, I got unstuck and had the project back on its feet in three days. Fantastic, practical advice.<br /><br />If you aspire to be the writer of the next Deadwood, move on; these are not the tips you are looking for. If you're serious about writing, and about making money doing so, this is a must-read.
B000QFAJ7S|3.0|While there are some good songs on this album, it is no where as good as Breakaway. This album shows she's not quite ready to write all her songs and go it alone yet. She would have been better writing with tried and true songwriters. She thinks she already has proven herself able with writing some songs on Breakaway, but she needed to grow more before doing a project like My December. Yes, she wrote some of her hits, but she's discounting the help the professional songwriters gave her in writing and mixing the songs so Breakaway sounded good.  While some of the songs are up tempo, the lyrics seem depressing and sad. There is not one happy song on the whole CD.     I think she made some major career mistakes that will hurt her. I hope she learns from this, and comes back better. First, I think Never Again is a good song, but she needed a less bitter song to start off as the first single. While Sober is a pretty song, it wasn't smart to come out with that as a second single at the same time the album was coming out. It's not a song radio will play, and the radio version is edited as well, which is another problem for the song. The second single needed to be a catchy song that people would make people excited to buy the CD. If this CD doesn't sell well, she's setting herself up to be hurt because of her total involvement in the project. It won't be just her album that will be rejected, she will feel like it is her that is rejected. I hope she can deal with that.    My favorite songs are Maybe, How I Feel and Can I Have A Kiss? My least favorite is Yeah and One Minute.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I would have rated it 4-stars for Al Gore's somewhat dry style, but I gave it a 5 because I think it is so important for people to see this. There is no question that global warming is real(and I knew before I saw this documentary) and that we are, at the least, significantly contributing to it. What blows me away is seeing the evidence of it in such an incontrovertible manner.    There are many things we can do to reduce our \\"carbon footprint\\", even without dramatically changing our lifestyles, things like using window fans or attic fans instead of turning on the A/C on relatively cool days, turning down the heat a notch and wearing an additional layer of clothing instead, being \\"energy-aware\\" in the home, at work and on the road. The trouble is that people don't seem to see that they need to make individual contributions, and that perception is what I think this documentary will change. Buy it, and share it with as many people as you can. This is a message that needs to be heard.
B00005JPRT|5.0|I'm pretty darned old to fall for a movie like this one, but I think I could see it once a week and there would be healing in my life!  Seriously.  In many ways it is just a very long wonderful music video, but the authenticity of the relationship between love and the creative process blew me away.  I have very little extra money, but will probably see it at least a couple more times before the summer ends.  It is rated R because the street language uses the f word - sounds poetic on an Irish tongue.  If you have a young teenanger - sneak them in.  I guarantee seeing the movie will make your IPOD texting kid a better person.  And it will certainly work on you.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|Is \\"My December\\" better than \\"Breakaway\\"?  \\"Breakaway\\" was really good and it's hard to compare the two.  So far I think that \\"My December\\" is a better album because it is more uniform and is more emotional.  Will it have the singles that \\"Breakaway\\" had?  Probably not.  There's not another \\"Since U Been Gone\\" on it.  But the songs on \\"Breakaway\\" never cut as deep as songs like \\"Sober\\" and \\"Irvine.\\"  There is more variety on \\"My December\\" as well which makes for a more interesting listen and possibly a longer shelf life.  True, it's not for everyone but I don't think it's that much of a strech for Kelly fans.  I absolutely love the uniqueness of songs like \\"Can I Have A Kiss\\" and \\"Chivas.\\"  Kelly has proven herself as a true artist.    My Top 5:  \\"One Minute\\"  \\"Sober\\"  \\"How I Feel\\"  \\"Can I Have A Kiss\\"  \\"Irvine\\"
B0002EXH5E|5.0|I purchases this CD when it came out, it was my second megadeth CD. I've read reviews on multiple Megadeth CD's saying \\"this ones the worst one, dont buy this one, get(insert cd name here)\\".... well i think this CD is great, along with every other megadeth CD ive heard. Of course each of their CD's are going to be different, Dave Mustaine goes through band members like starbucks goes through coffee beans. One of the reasons that I like megadeth is that their music on each CD IS different.<br /><br />Anyway, back to this cd. It does lack alot of the faster paced music as the other albums and seems a little more \\"mainstream\\" but by no means is this a \\"bad\\" cd. All the songs on this CD are great, and people seem to have a problem that the CD is melodic. Id rate 7 songs 5 stars, 2 songs 4 stars, and 2 songs 3 stars. (enter the arena doesnt count). 49/55 stars is 89%, a great CD.<br /><br />DONT BUY THIS CD IF YOUR EXPECTING ALOT OF GUITARS.... DONT BUY THIS CD IF YOUR A FAN OF OLD MEGADETH.... THIS CD IS MELODIC WITH ELECTRONIC INFLUENCES....<br /><br />I love this cd, most of the songs are still hard with great lyrics. Also Dave Mustaine is able to pull off the melodic singing quite well.
B000QFAJ7S|4.0|This album has the same great music with more of an emotional touch. I love her edgy sound and this has plenty of it. I don't understand why everyone was so concerned with this being a flop. I would purchase it again and again.
0743277457|5.0|This is a very well written book about performance competition. Although I do not professionally compete in games, I found Josh's message to be applicable to every day life. I met Josh at a book signing and he seemed like an intense competitor and very open person. I enjoyed this book and I have enjoyed his work in ChessMaster. My only criticism of this book is that I don't believe the first part of the title \\"Art of Learning\\" fits the contents, but more the second part \\"Journey in the Pursuit of Excellence,\\" since the book describes a personal account of Josh's own learning experience.
B000MRA5NS|5.0|I must sympathize with the makers of this movie as it must be one of the hardest BD titles to sell. Don't get me wrong it is reference quality in video and audio but with Sony's marketing ploy of giving this title away with every sale of a PS3, really the market has been saturated with freebies. I know a lot of people have received 2 or even 3 free copies of this BD movie and they are themselves giving their free copies away on forums.
0385522401|4.0|ON CHESIL BEACH produced a mixed reaction in me. Certainly, this novella delivered McEwan's usual articulate and entrancing prose, which has made me a devoted reader of his work. In this case, McEwan uses this prose to explore the relationship of Edward and Florence, both virgins, and their sad miscommunication on their wedding night. As written by McEwan, their story is absolutely gripping and demonstrates the power of his prose to give substance and clarity to interactions that, while not ordinary, are not really extraordinary either.<br /><br />Even so, I did ask myself a middle-brow question after completing ON CHESIL BEACH. This is: Could this novella be a movie? Here, I'd say the answer is probably not. (Yes, I'm sure someone already has the movie rights.) The reason is that the story, taken from its near-perfect literary vehicle, would verge on risible on the screen. I say this because things go horribly wrong in this relationship not because of bad sex but because of the failed conversation afterwards. This conversation is hurtful and childish. But at some point, every couple endures worse and tries again. At a movie, this climactic scene (cue the violins please) would produce plenty of snickering, with the audience realizing the story is overwrought.<br /><br />This, I suppose, is one of the great tests of a writer's talent. What matters is not whether the story is plausible. What matters is that the writer makes his story plausible. (Yes, SUPERMAN I.) Here, McEwan succeeds, with other reviewers on this forum describing ON CHESIL BEACH as moving and heartbreaking.  But when I closed the book and curtailed the power of its articulate writing, I thought: no, it's almost nonsense.<br /><br />McEwan is a great stylist. But is he a great writer? I thought AMSTERDAM, ATONEMENT, and SATURDAY were terrific books because McEwan transcended the element of miscommunication that shadows couples or drives the plot in his earlier novels. (For the record, these couples are: THE COMFORT OF STRANGERS (`81), Colin and Mary; THE CHILD IN TIME (`87), Stephen and Julie; THE INNOCENT (`89), Leonard and Maria; BLACK DOGS (`92), Bernard and June; and ENDURING LOVE (`97), Joe and Clarissa.)<br /><br />For me, AMSTERDAM (`98) was the breakthrough book. There, McEwan created another miscommunicating couple. But these were old friends--Clive and Vernon. And in AMSTERDAM, McEwan was writing about career setbacks, with miscommunication more of a plot device than a subject. Then in ATONEMENT (`01), we got some weird characters, but they were in life trying to accomplish something or manage injustice. Finally, in SATURDAY (`05), we are with a London doctor, who copes on a Saturday with different types of violence, most of which is commonplace and that we ordinarily ignore. What I'm saying is that in these three novels, McEwan uses his great gifts to tackle bigger themes, not simply to examine the tense interaction of a couple, often with sexual dysfunction.<br /><br />Surely, the point to remember is that ON CHESIL BEACH is a highly accomplished novella, which McEwan's publisher put out there ($22, U.S.) for his fans, who, if they are like me, were delighted to have another McEwan work to read. Still, this is Ian reworking his small stuff.  I'm sure the next book will tackle more.GERS (`81), Colin and Mary; THE CHILD IN TIME (`87), Stephen and Julie; THE INNOCENT (`89), Leonard and Maria; BLACK DOGS (`92), Bernard and June; and ENDURING LOVE (`97), Joe and Clarissa.)

B0001WGIBW|4.0|Our son had the basic set of train tracks.  We bought this as a 2-present package:  he got 1/2 at Christmas and  1/2 at his birthday soon thereafter.  He was positively over the top about this for months.<br /><br />This has several different pieces which aren't in the basic set, which allows a greater variety of tracks to build.  With the basic pack this lets you put together a pretty large track, which, as my son puts is, \\"goes round and round and round\\".  Big without being gigantic.  Has 3-connector pieces and some that let you elevate the track and switch the direction of assembly (i.e., one has 2 tabs, another has 2 holes)
6305161992|5.0|I enjoyed this movie very much.  I do not go to an action 90's movie  expecting to see Sir Laurence Olivier.  Nor do I expect Lundgren to become  the Govenor of California.  This movie is fantasy, if you pay your money  and expect Hamlet, you are guilty of a poor investment.    The movie is exactly what I thought it would and should be.  Sure there  are disturbing segments, but no more so than an esoteric study such as  \\"The Hours\\".  Honestly, is the genre and dialog any worse than \\"Lethal  Weapon\\"?  Are the Asian slurs and stereotypes any different than \\"Black  Rain\\"    \\"You get what you pay for. . . .\\" and with this movie and the proper  release of reality, cinematic snobery and (yes) good taste, you will get  even more.  Try not to enjoy it too much!  Just remember not to take it  too seriously.  After all, do we really know Luke Skywalker can operate  a futuristic X-wing fighter after quitting the dirt farmer profession?
B00005OM4Q|5.0|Over the last few years I have followed a few bands around and do so for the music, and nothing else.  This movies spoke to me like none other I have seen before.  I have seen the band fights, the drugs, the drinking, and the heartaches.  I have also felt the same heartache that Penny Lane felt when she fell for Russell.  I even have a tendency to steal things like William does in the movie.  Even if you don't hang with bands this movie is a lot of fun.  I give this movie 6 out of 5 stars.  It's a new look at bands and how they really bond and work with each other.

I missed the curl of dread in my belly when the characters were in danger - Harry Potter put it there long ago.

1400097029|5.0|Do not read this book for plot. There are no cliffhangers, action-packed scenes, steamy sex scenes or pages filled with raucous humor.  If one uses any of these measures as a rubric for whether or not to read a book, then cease and desist from reading this particular book as you will be mightily disappointed, but please, please do read this book for the beauty of the prose.  Banville is a master language craftsman and one savors his sentences as one would savor the taste and texture of a fine piece of high quality chocolate. After finishing the novel, I found myself going back to reread certain descriptions and passages to experience anew and again the poetic quality of the prose.          After reading the book, I realized that the book does not even have likeable characters. Each character is strange and unlikeable in his or her own way. Max, the protagonist is particularly unlikeable, and as the narrator, the readers sees everything through his eyes. Max, an art historian who seems to talk about writing the monograph on Bonnard more than he actually does any actual writing of the monograph, returns after the death of his wife Anna  to the village in which he summered as a boy, a place he has not seen in fifty years.  The book begins with, \\"They departed, the gods, on the day of the strange tide,\\" and Max refers to those years long ago when he he summered there as a child as being \\"in the time of the gods.\\" Max is referring to the mythic gods of Greece and thus one is aware of the enormously profound effect on his entire life of that summer when he was eleven and met the family Grace, a family firmly esconced in the Cedars with all the requisite trappings of success - a cruel juxtaposition to Max's much more meager accomodations in the Chalet, made all the more cruel by the abandonment of his father, leaving only Max and his indifferent mother in the lowly Chalet with the Primus stove. Max hungers to fulfill some mythic fantasy of himself - he hungers to elevate his status and he is mesmerized by the Grace family. He first harbors an adolescent boy's crush on Mrs. Grace and then he focuses on her daugher, Chloe Grace, twin to the \\"voiceless other,\\" her brother Myles. The twins share an eerie connection, which will be made more clear at the end of the novel.        This is very much a novel about what Max refers to as the annihilating force of the past. Indeed Max tells us, \\"The past beats inside me like a second heart.\\" Even his daughter Claire, with whom he has a very distant relationship, tells him that he lives too much in the past. He admits not really knowing either his wife or his daughter and he is able to comment on their traits, even on their bodily smells as distantly and dispassionately as one would expect from a disinvolved outside observer. Max refers to the past as a place of \\"womby warmth\\" and he finds it to be a much more comfortable place that the cold present or future. In his mind, he seems to have achieved at the ripe young age of eleven that summer a closeness and a communion with Chloe Grace that he does not seem to be able to replicate in his adult life. Max admits to us that he is lazy, inattentive, self-absorbed and drinks like a fish, but one is drawn to his story by the force of Banville's language. Banville  seamlessly connects the two stories - the one of Max and Anna facing her terminal diagnosis and the one of Max's memories of that mythic summer. The stories flow into each other perfectly and there is no jarring effect on the reader.         I just want to leave you with one sentence which may or may not inspire you to read the novel but which I believe is a fair representation of the author's craft. Upon seeing the room at the Cedars when he returns after Anna's death, the room probably slept in by Mr. and Mrs. Grace, Max reflects, \\"I was nervous of this moment, the moment when I would have to take on the house, to put it on, as it were, like something I had worn in another, prelapsarianlife, a once fashionable hat, say, an outmoded pair of shoes, or a wedding suit, smelling of mothballs and no longer fitting around the waist and too tight under the arms but bulging with memories in every pocket.\\" For me - that is enough to recommend this book.

When I saw the boxset of DTS version on the market, I decided to try \\"just one of them\\" and I chose \\"A trick of the Tail\\" instead of buying the box., just to see if it was really better.

I will be buying the DVD when it comes out but I recommend people see it at the theaters now while you can.  The scenes of Paris are stunning!    Let me warn you that you will want to travel to France and eat at a very expensive restaurant when you walk out of this film.    I found a recipe online for ratatouille because I just HAVE to try it now. I really wish Disney would come out with a Ratatouille cookbook with all the recipes of the food that was shown.  I was salivating all the way through the movie.

B000J10ERO|2.0|It might be easiest to give my review in the form of lists.  1. Things we didn't need more of: Brando's Jor-El, Clark's goofiness (stumbling into revolving door with Lois, etc.), romantic flying scene with Supe and Lois, endless CGI destruction scenes (city crumbling, things falling on cars, etc -- this has been done in so many movies it's really time to do something new)  2. Things that don't make any sense, but the writers and directors were too dumb or lazy to know it: Young Clark wearing glasses (which were a disguise for Superman, who didn't exist yet); the weightless scene when the plane goes into a dive also inexplicably causing silence in the cabin; the electro-magnetic pulse turning off all power in the area except for the baseball stadium; pilots continuing to try to fly the plane as it nosed straight down with NO WINGS; etc.  3. Just plain weird stuff: the obsession with small dogs eating each other and being eaten by humans; the toy figures in Lex's model screaming as the model destructed (what the heck was that about??)  4. Just plain annoying stuff: Perry White saying \\"Truth, Justice, all that stuff...\\" (Hollywood is so far over the cliff it can't even tolerate the phrase \\"the American way\\"); the kid.  There were some things I liked, such as Superman rising above the clouds to be recharged by the sun -- stuff like that. But overall? Not well done at all.

B00005JPQT|3.0|***1/2<br /><br />After a twelve-year-long hiatus in which he was off doing other things, Bruce Willis finally returns to his signature role of NYPD detective John McClane in \\"Live Free or Die Hard,\\" a pulse-pounding action film guaranteed to confirm every paranoid suspicion you've ever had that humans are indeed at the mercy of technology.<br /><br />In this installment, McClane has gone far beyond rescuing people trapped in a burning building; he's moved into saving-the-world territory as he takes on a disgruntled security expert who, after his warnings about massive system failure are ignored by the United States government, devises a plan to bring society to its knees through a mind-boggling display of techno terrorism.<br /><br />Director Len Wiseman doesn't fool around when it comes to giving the action audience what it's paid good money to see; from the very first scene, he shifts into full-throttle mode and never once lets up throughout the course of the movie.  In fact, so skillful is he at staging the elaborate action scenes that one barely notices that a mere human being like McClane winds up withstanding a tougher pounding than any genuine super-powered superhero ever have had to put up with even on his worst day.  Indeed, McClane engineers so many hairbreadth escapes and arises unscathed from so many predicaments that would have killed a lesser man ten times over that we begin to think he should be given a comic book of his own for all his efforts.<br /><br />Clearly, credibility is never a very high priority for any action movie, and \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" compensates for its weakness in that area by being fast-paced, seamlessly stitched together and surprisingly good-natured despite the rather alarming body count it manages to pile up in time for the closing credits.  Nobody embodies the sardonic, wisecracking, stoic hero better than Willis, and even in his early 50`s, he displays an agility and athleticism that would turn many younger action stars green with envy.  Willis receives fine support from Justin Long, Timothy Olyphant, Cliff Curtis and the beautiful Maggie Q.  Although easily nine-tenths of the movie is straight-on action, writer Mark Bomback still manages to sprinkle in the requisite one-liners all such protagonists need if they are to be taken seriously as action figures, and he has fun with the irony that the bad guys with all their cybernetic gizmos and technological thingamabobs are no match for McClane's good old-fashioned ingenuity and brainpower.<br /><br />What would the world do without John McClane?eceives fine support from Justin Long, Timothy Olyphant, Cliff Curtis and the beautiful Maggie Q.

006085880X|5.0|This was my fifth Picoult book and it, like the others, was fantastic.  As with Plain Truth, Salem Falls, Picture Perfect and Vanishing Acts, I was caught up in the characters right away.  This author has a true talent for \\"hooking\\" the reader early in the story.  Her writing has a way of making me oddly uncomfortable, but yet unable to leave unfinished.  The subject matters in Picoult's books are real-life, compelling the reader to examine society issues that everyone wants to know more about, but that no one wants to speak of.  Ms. Picoult has a true talent in her range of depth and emotion in her characters.  She weaves together the lives of the characters intricately and believably.  And her description of prison life in several of her books, is enough to cause just about anyone to be \\"scared-straight\\".      It definitely should go on your list of books to read.

B0000B0WVQ|5.0|i feel that i should be slightly apologetic, for reviewing this so late after the release.  i actually was exposed to electrelane at a live show with le tigre in 2005.  i was hooked, HOOKED after seeing these incredibly talented women perform.  it took ages to find \\"the power out\\" in hard copy at the local record store, but since i've obtained it, i've relished every nostalgic moment of seeing them live and have consistently put this as my top played songs.<br /><br />i don't feel that i could more adequately describe their tracks as the very able reviewers below me, but i can say that this is the most hidden jewel of all experimental-indie bands out there.  almost every song evokes a very strong emotional response from within, and i have to say, if you're a person who loves being solitary and lean more towards the creative, i'd recommend this album whole-heartedly.  it's an anthem album for the melancholy, but secure in their aloneness.
