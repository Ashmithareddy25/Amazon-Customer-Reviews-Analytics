0345529057|1.0|I have not seen the tv show that I was told was violent, but the books seemed to be popular so I thought I would try.  I read a lot of sci-fi/fantasy novels, but this has to be one of the worst!  I'm not sure whether I will give them away or burn them.  I will admit I did not even finish the first book because halfway through I couldn't stand it anymore!  The characters have no redeeming qualities and the story is incredibly dark.  I don't understand how the book jacket can describe this as \\"romantic\\" unless you think a forced marriage between a 13-year old girl and 30-year old man is romantic (he rapes her repeatedly until she's pregnant at 14!).  Disgusting.  Save your money!  I read for entertainment, not nightmares.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Had heard about this book and was interested in finging out what all the talk was about.<br />This sure was an eye opener!
B007QDNKQA|5.0|What a fantastic movie.  This movie is  everything you would expect it to be.  Interesting, whose the good guys vs. whose the bad guys.
B002WN8IQQ|5.0|I love this movie!!!!! I bought a few other movies from amazon at the same time and they were free shipping so it was well worth the money for the movies.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Have Always Loved These Types Of Games And This One Is Better Than Most! Starts Out Fairly Easy And Progressively Gets Harder, But Not Too Hard! Makes You Think But Not Exasperating!!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I enjoy this author very much.  I am sad when I finish each book in the series knowing I will have to wait for the next book to be published.
B00CW665VI|3.0|I was so so very excited when I saw Tangled was out. The book description looked like something that I wouldn't just like, but absolutely fall in love with. Plus, Tanlged is something different than normal books. It is 100% in a MALE point of view. Crazy, right?<br /><br />Drew is what I would call an average player. He is working in his fathers investment banking firm, and therefore, seems to get anything and everything he wants. The only real difference is that Drew actual works hard at his job and is good at it.<br /><br />  Like a guy's going to say to his friend, \\" Dude, she was one fugly chick, but once I saw her chomping that romaine, I just had to nail her.\\"<br /><br />Kate is engaged to her long-time high school sweetheart. They became engaged when she went off to college, but a lot can change in ten years. She is just starting her first job after getting her MBA and ends up at the same firm as Drew. Kate is what most would call a strong character: funny, smart, pretty and loyal.<br /><br />To be honest, Kate didn't do much for me. It might be that she only a little part in the story, even being a main character, that I didn't get to know her on a level other than work and sex. I couldn't seem to connect with her on any level. It was bad enough that I finished the book first thing this morning and now at 2:30 in the afternoon I have already forgotten her name. That is a pretty good sign of a forgettable character. Drew, not so much, yum!<br /><br />I enjoyed the story itself, plot and characters (well, most of them), but there was something about the writing that I had a hard time with. I don't need a metaphor for every situation to understand a book. I think that if you do need that, this probably isn't the type of book you should be reading in the first place. Okay, the metaphors weren't every few paragraphs, but it sure seemed like it. Because of this it made the story seem rather slow. Instead of having more interaction between the characters to see their relationship grow, we got Drew narrating and using metaphors. I found this to be a big distraction and hard keep focused on the story.<br /><br />  I may end up being the first man in history capable of masturbating without touching himself.<br />Look, Mom-no hands.<br /><br />While some parts of this book were entertaining and funny, I didn't find it to be laugh-out-loud funny, like most. And believe me, there have been times that I have embarrassed myself by laughing so hard at books, in public no less, that people start looking at me funny. I know it sounds like I hated this book, but I didn't. I think Emma Chase did an awesome job stepping out and writing a book that is different. I know that there are many other books out there that are done in a guys POV, but it is usually the second book in a series, in which we already know what happens.<br /><br />If you are thinking about reading Tangled, I say go for it. It really is different, in a good way, and you might have a different experience with Drew and Kate than I did. I will still be putting Tangled on To-read again list in hopes that I catch more the second time around.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game! It kept me entertained and got the brain gears movin'! It's a fun challenge but its not too difficult. Can't wait for the new levels to come out!
B0040I09RM|5.0|Once you start watching it brings you in and each episode gets better. Then season 2 has been better than the first. Overall one of the best series I have seen.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I bought it before I actually bought a Kindle and ended up going with the Ipad, so I gave the case to my friend. It's beautiful in person, a little pinker than I expected.
B002FRNCG0|5.0|I recently discovered Paramore and the perfection that is Hayley Williams. The music is just amazing. I definitely recommend it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great second book, I couldn't put it down and can't wait to pick up the final one!  I don't know why I waited so long after the first to read it.
B00BSBUZPK|4.0|A must for all die-hard Eagles fans out there !<br />Pre-ordered it and got it for a very decent price.
B005SAP45I|3.0|I was really disappointed on the second one, because the first one is my cartoon favorites. However, it is a very cute cartoon.
030789701X|5.0|This book is a great reference for Skyrim. Beautiful to look at, heavy to hold. Really makes you feel the collector's edition is worth it.
B009JZTP4Y|2.0|The movie is just a little too slow for those of us who aren't really into Star Trek.  Not a whole lot actually happens.
B006ZN7KMM|4.0|Buenos relatos para revivir el pasado reciente. Entretenido. Documentado. Desde la política española, hasta los temas que hoy mueven la agenda pública en el mundo.

B0045HCJ94|4.0|good movie, la compre porque ya sabia que era buena película, y ademas el dvd tiene muy buena calidad de fabricación y calidad de vídeo.
B009CG8VKO|4.0|An epic fantasy that includes every element of the genre you could want. Great date nite movie, or good for a rainy afternoon. Love this film. Beautiful visuals, HD looked great, awsome makeup and special effects. Wish I would have bought the blu-ray! Digital copy was way overpriced and not returnable/tradeable/loanable.....bummer.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I LOVE kik messenger it's the best way to message a friend or family. So I rated 5 stars for kik
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I was a fan of the first 3 they were awesome so I figured this would be good like the others but it's so much better and so worth the money
B0050DZN4K|2.0|I switched to Feedly b/c google reader was going away.  It works but its 'bells and whistles' are difficult to understand.  I also can't email an article straight from the interface nor can I search my feeds.
B00C70FH7M|5.0|Great release by these fine gentleman very progressive they are one of my favorite prog bands of 2013 purchase this album 5/5
0345529057|5.0|I was looking for a simple fiction that I could just relax with.  This series is long enough to last me awhile, only problem is that the final book appears to be years off and I don't think I'll want to wait for it!
044024613X|5.0|Definitely a page turner. My opinion is biased because the setting is in my proverbial neighborhood. However, I felt like you were able to connect with the characters and really feel their anguish.
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|I just play angry birds to pass the time....and lately I haven't much to to spare so I have not played this much.
0345525558|5.0|Great quick read! More than a beach read, but definitely more targeted towards a woman. Perfect for twenty-something to read between semesters or when commuting to work.
B008742O32|4.0|Airdroid is a good app but what's with Amazon not sending out updates in a timely manner...?? Airdroid 2 has updated. Everywhere EXCEPT Amazon... I hate how slow Amazon is with updates...
B00BHU2A7I|3.0|Hopkins played Hitchcock great, but the story didn't draw me in (or my wife's).  Interesting bits and pieces that I didn't know about him, but we actually got a little bored.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|What a wonderful second book in a great series! It picks up right where book one ended with Ana miserable and missing Christian but then he's back just in time to save her! LOVE CHRISTIAN GREY!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun for kids and as I found out adults as well! I highly recommend this game to everyone!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is fun and really wraps you in. it is so addicting and I wish there were more rooms!
B007A4SDCG|5.0|I'm a struggling actress in Hollywood...this book helped pull me out of the mire and set my feet on higher ground. Forever thankful for the simplistic approach Mr. Pressfield has so graciously given.
1400052181|5.0|I had to buy this book for an Intro English class and I loved this book!! It was a very easy read
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Challenging fun addictive.... Hope that they make more levels soon!!!  If your a puzzle person this is your game!<br />Can't. wait for the update.
B002XMGGK6|4.0|This is almost the ultimate in &#34;revenge is a dish best served cold&#34; movie. Didn't care for the ending so much, though.
B003IEJZUG|4.0|Excellent book...... reminds me of the movie Castaway, only with a tiger in place of Wilson. I enjoyed it thoroughly.
B000069HZP|4.0|Purchased this because I recall having seen it years ago. This movie has several unexpected twists in it, which is why I liked it; caught the viewer by surprise. I wish someone in the movie business would produce one with a different character and different experiences; I think the possibilities are wide open.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The gameplay of this app is amazing. The challanges want to make you keep playing. The desingners did a fabulous job!
B001TODCII|4.0|Fun to see a movie where the hero seems to overcome insurmountable hurdles to rescue daughter. The manner in which the &#34;talents&#34; of the father are used, is the key to making this movie interesting, not to mention I like Liam Neeson as an actor.
B0050DZN4K|2.0|If a company cannot solve the feed update problem then what's the use releasing a  reader that's not performing its most basic task. Flipnote isn't perfect but seems to do the job, netvibes is decent too
B005LAIIPS|5.0|I am biased, I liked the Bourne series. The producers did a good job of following an excellent series with Matt Damon, without overdoing it. Renner's character, Aaron Cross was a good a move away from the Jason Bourne character, and to open up the possibilities for more movies.<br />Look forward to the next &#34;Bourne&#34; movie and I hope Renner is in it.
0399157565|4.0|As most reviews have said, the more recent Scarpetta novels have gone off track, dealing more with psychological angst and depressing relationships than with what the earlier novels did so well, the forensic process.  BONE BED reminded me of the earlier novels with  its more focused look at the details of investigation.<br /><br />Yes, Kay is still working through her various relationships with her niece, her partner, and her husband, but they don't take as much of the book as some other novels did. And I didn't mind that she is still dealing with earlier problems with them--I think that is realistic and makes her human.  I found the plot interesting except for the ending; (spoiler alert) I couldn't remember at all the killer's appearance earlier in the novel, which made it seem too left-field an ending. The focus on serial killers in each book is getting rather old, too.  And I sometimes have found her endings don't live up to one's expectations, after such a detailed progress through the plot.<br /><br />But all in all, I mostly enjoyed the book (except she needs to give Benton and Kay some actual love scenes!) and hope the next ones continue to focus on Kay Scarpetta's forensic abilities as well.
B002ZG997C|4.0|This is another movie with some surprise twists which make it interesting. Liked Densel's &#34;Eli&#34; character portrayal.  It has a great ending.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Unlike any other game I have ever played.  Totally unique premise. . . addicting!  My family and I could not put it down until we escaped all ten rooms.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|The theories of NDEs are dispelled here by a top neurologist, in a way that anyone can understand and appreciate.  Whether you are a believer or not, this book should be on your list to read.  Educational, heartwarming, and definitely thought-provoking.
B00B22IJXK|5.0|One of the best drawing apps I have ever used. It's easy to use and draws precisely. Thank You For A Great App.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|this series is a great combo for fans of dexter and x-files. hope you all enjoy it as much as i have
B004PGAQMW|5.0|his is a great funny movie that my whole family has enjoyed we really like the silly fun of it
0894803123|5.0|Great book for soft serve I've cream. There are so many different kinds of ice cream. Something to please everyone. You will be happy with this purchase!
B00BHMETKC|3.0|This is a bit confusing if you don't know the context. After doing a little reading though I thought it was a cool movie that was fun to watch.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Well written, great scenery and the plot continues develop. I've watched the 1st four episodes and plan to watch the rest of this season.
B0043JDUNS|4.0|This movie is was quite well done and it is fun to watch. I personally like the first one better but this ties in well with the story and is understandable.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|It took me a year to start after I heard about it - it took me a week to watch it.<br />I watched it streaming with a friend over Skype and despite our lives we managed to watch the whole season in a week.<br />I absolutely adore this show.
B001KZG99A|5.0|One of my favorite movies. It is fun to watch and keeps the idealistic idea from the comic books alive.
B008VO3PA4|5.0|A must read for cat owners!  I could see the personality of my pets reflected in many of the poems.  I laughed out loud many times while reading!
B0019IIPXQ|4.0|A fun movie to watch. This has quite a lot of background though so it may be worth watching twice or reading the wiki.
B00AH8FTT2|1.0|A reasonable read up to a conclusion which was contrived and designed to sell the next instalment.One is left feeling cheated and wholly unsatisfied I suggest there are many novels of this genre which will better justify the readers effort.
B000ID1J0E|5.0|this was ordered for my son for christmas and he loves the movie.  he has enjoyed it glad amazon had it for me to order.
B008JJM88Q|4.0|I love akinater he is so  smart and yes I know he's a game but so worth paying $2 for.
B0036O0ELC|5.0|This is a great recording. Other singers have sounded more beautiful or more thrilling in these roles but I don't think any other recording of this opera has four singers who bring their characters to life so vividly. Anything Callas recorded after 1954 is going to have at least a couple of wobbly high notes so you have to expect that. But this may be the only Turandot to have been sung by a real singing actress. Callas and Schwartzkopf are completely into their roles and no doubt a lot of credit is due to Serafin who creates magical sounds with the orchestra,
B0063IH60K|5.0|I luv this game i do real good and i like i can add my own pics to it to make it my own
B008476HBM|5.0|I have read this one twice. My only problem with the book is that I didn't want it to end. I wish Ms. Austen had written a sequel, but 'twasn't to be (sigh). My favourite characters are Lizzie and Mr. Darcy, of course. I enjoyed Mr. Bennet's sense of humour and Mrs. Bennet's histrionics. Some readers may not like Lydia and Wickham, but there could hardly be a story without them. Of course, we all know individuals like Mr. Collins (a name-dropping toady) and Lady Catherine (a snide, condescending snob). With its variety of interesting personalities, Pride and Prejudice is my favourite Austen work...give it a go.
B005K15XR4|5.0|I would say this is my second favorite CD of the two steps series with Archangel being NO.1, but this is really good!
B009HUB40Y|4.0|I love match three games. This one is fun when you get additional help by making a lot of matches without hesitating.
B00A6SZRJ0|5.0|Its a nice expected change! You will like it and if your a collector of the two steps collection its a must!
B006FPFTMS|4.0|Workings still in progress. I'm learning how to use this product,I'm  not to familiar with computerized info paper and pen always worked well I thought it was time to learn a little more.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a game perfect for kids. I would recommend it to all of my friends at school. But sadly I wish it was easier to get gems.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|This movie started out as all movies do...setting the stage for what's to come. It had enough elements of surprise to keep you wondering what's next. The action sequences were good and the end was satisfying. I would recommend it.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|And was not dissapointed with his new book.Very good reading material and entertaining. It is also very informative of a world we do not know.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I can't stop playing! I want more algae, sand dollars, and pearls. The is my calm escape game but I want all the fish to come my reef and have a party.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|This book is a gritty description of what some of the most grueling combat in World War II was like for a marine. I found it very interesting and sometimes hard to take. The book is very suspenseful, and almost unbelievable, as truth really can be stranger than fiction.<br />  At the same time, one gets a first-hand look and description into some of the most important military events of World War II.
B0013TPV0Q|5.0|Dear David Sedaris,<br />Never, never stop writing in those little notebooks. I always know that, while reading any of your books, there will be at least one time that I laugh and cry, at the same time.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|Boz just keeps going--he's so versatile. This album seems to tip its hat to Memphis icons--Al Green-flavored tracks, some delicious, grinding blues, a bit of Louis Jordan. A musical tour of one of our great musical cities.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This book had an interesting plot, plus lots of action. I love adventure novels, but I don't want a dumbed down book. I enjoyed all the details about the weapons used and the hand-to-hand combat. I could imagine the action in my head. Just got book #2.
B00CCZ4BFQ|5.0|As a Cinderella fan from way back, I was extremely surprised at how good this album is - Keifer's voice sounds fantastic and the the songs are really well crafted.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|Good movie to watch on a night in. It was hilarious, yet had a very real feel to it that was very interesting to take in.
B00BAYLQI0|4.0|The fact that it is based on a true story is wrenching to you and their story is as hellish as true life can get.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Did not enjoy as much as his previous two books but beautiful prose and wonderfully intertwined stories.  A must read!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|It is so beautifully done, I can watch it over and over again! The acting, the sets, the wardrobe and the scenic are superb!
1484051564|4.0|I ordered these books for my English I HGT class for next school year.  I love to teach this novel.  It is full of life lessons and many symbols.
B005QBBCMI|4.0|This movie is one of the best displays of genuine addiction and codependency. Great to show in substance abuse groups or to watch for entertainment, well acted.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Was a good story, very quick read. It was a little depressing but still had a nice ending. I felt that some parts could have been expanded to make a longer story, a little more detailed maybe.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|I am a social network queen, it is so good have everything you need on every electronic toy.  I call my Kindle Fire and phone toys (smile).
B0002UOK04|4.0|Though this is a good CD and I like it, I think their second CD is better. I hope to see them live this fall.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I love this little tool, I use it on my Kindle Fire as well as my android phone!  It cleans out your cache for you those unwanted files!
B00BMTX2QM|5.0|This being the last Cathedral CD, they went out on a high note. Great songs and production! I personally will miss them.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I absolutely love this app, I love the fact I can choose and mix my own relaxation sounds depending on my mood.  I had a friend to visit me that was suffering with insomnia, I put together a combination of sounds for her and placed it by her bedside, she slept the entire night and was disappointed she could not find this app for her iPhone.  I have this installed on my Kindle Fire and i mix my sounds and music, put it on low and boy it really relaxes you!
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|This is different than a Cinderella CD. I got to see him live and it was a great show. This is a good CD, some of the songs were written years ago, but are just now seeing the light of day.
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|Great movie to see I recommend it to everyone. Lots of action and Bruce Willis is alway great to watch
B00CWY76CC|4.0|THIS GAME IS FUN TO PLAY AND A GREAT GAME TO GET YOU THINKING. I PROMISE YOU'LL LOVE IT. HAVE FUN!
B000MCIBAW|4.0|This second album shows the road the Doors were trying to take for their future. It contains some hits, but the emphasis is clearly on their musical philosophy via Mr. Morrison's poetry. Some great work here which will live forever... definitely not a miss!
1451695195|5.0|This is a wonderful book about Eben Alexander's near death experience.  I cried when I finished it.  I felt like it deepened the faith I already had in an afterlife.  I loved the descriptive language about Heaven and the beautiful music and the beings he encountered.  It makes you look forward to going to Heaven someday.
0634022296|4.0|As others have written, this is an easy way to gather all of your favorite Beatle tunes in the correct keys.....It's paperback format, however, makes it more of a reference book unless you take the time to bring to a Kinkos or similar, and have it rebound into a spiral book format which is how it should have been offered in the first place.  Nonetheless, if  you want 99% of Beatle &#34;chordololgy&#34;, it's there.  Do not expect to find signature riffs....that's not what this book is about.  Strictly chord diagrams and lyrics.
0307352153|5.0|Did  you know that at least one-third of all the people in the world are introverts?  They prefer listening to speaking, reading to going out to parties, staying in as opposed to hitting the grad parties, weddings.  They tend to dislike self promotion and favor working on their own over team brainstorming sessions.  They are labeled quiet, shy, unsure of themselves, non sociable.... and in many cases that is not true at all.<br /><br />Did you know the introverts of our society actually approach challenges not as rushed as an extrovert, not speaking as loudly or as quickly as an extrovert, and that is ok?  It is ok to be more of a listener and a processor than the up front idea person.  After all introverts contribute much to our society... it was an introvert who invented the personal computer.  Rosa Parks was an introvert.<br /><br />I absolutely adored this book.  Why?  Because it absolutely spoke to me and it was about me.  That person who would rather work quietly at their desk prodding along without a team of people to assist?  That is me.  That person who walks into a party and sees no one she knows so finds a quiet corner to hang out in?  Me.  The person who listens more than speaks during staff meetings?  Me again.<br /><br />Yet I have friends who are shocked when they hear me refer to myself as an introvert.  I am not overcome by stage fright, I can speak to large groups of people, I can lead a book discussion group, a committee, and be an advocate for a cause.  What my friends need to remember is that the day they met me, I did not run up squeal and hug them.  :D  It takes time for me to warm into a group where I feel comfortable to speak up with my ideas and opinions.  I don't have the \\"bull in a china shop\\" mentality where I can charge on in and look around later.... I need to know my surroundings and get a feel for the environment and the people around me before I can move forward.<br /><br />What I took away from Quiet is that the way I need to energize is by being alone, and not always wanting to take on a group of people to complete a task I can do on my own, is normal introvert behavior.  And better yet, it is ok to ask this way.  That was kind of life changing for me to hear that.  I do like to work alone.  I do get excited when I come home and I have the house to myself.  I am sure my lifestyle of kids gone and hubby working all the time does not help me control this desire.  I am alone a lot.  And I really like it.<br /><br />We know society leans in favor towards the extrovert.  We see them on TV and they are the actors and actresses we are drawn to by the power they have to capture our attention.  They are the people around us who flourish in business discussions, can rule the conversation in a group, and can be found at most social engagements.  Yes what Susan Cain lets us know is not to overlook the person who is more quiet, more reflective than verbal... after all they are the makings of J K Rowling, Steve Jobs, Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein, and Steven King.<br /><br />As book lovers, I think many of us may be considered introverts.<br /><br />Kathe Mazur does a fine job of narrating this one.  Highly recommended to anyone who has ever been told they need to speak up more, has been called quiet or shy and knows that there is more to them than meets the eye.ize is by being alone, and not always wanting to take on a group of people to complete a task I can do on my own, is normal introvert behavior.

B00A6RCSKC|4.0|Challenging enough to keep you interested without being so difficult that you give up.  You don't need to buy upgrades to succeed in the game.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Really enjoy this workout video! It shipped to my house very quick. The different levels are perfect. You will need a mat if you have hard floors.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Had a great time with this game and it was free; you cant beat that. I can play this game for hours.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Comes on automatically when connected to the charger. Provides warnings when power levels are low. It also has pretty colors on the display.
B0009P66TK|5.0|beautiful watch, plus the warranty is international, sophisticated good size, I am very happy with my watches. is an excellent choice for gift.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game makes me feel like I am really taking care of a real horse when I'm not!!! It's surreal!!
B003QSLW0K|4.0|Good story easy for kids to follow. Will watch again.  Not too long,  the children did not get restless or bored.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The proper ratio of laugh to cry in a book is not hard to achieve. We feel hurt better than we feel happy, so the proper ratio falls somewhere in about 1:4. However well this book meets that standard, I can not statistically attest to, but I can say that it felt like perfection with a splash of champagne. Read and you will know what I mean.  Also, it is a good read if you wish to be content with your mind's quirks and enjoy other's through these characters. It will assist you in leading an examined life and there is no better gift.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Definitely an addicting game!! If you like a challenging game that really makes you use your mind, download this one!!
B000FBGBPC|5.0|This cd showed up in near perfect condition. I say near because you could tell it had been used due to the wear. I will say I enjoyed all the songs on this album.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love using pintrest for meals, crafts, party ideas. The variety and organization are appealing. I would reccomend Pintrest to anyone!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|relaxing. tension busting app with so many choices! anyone who is holistic will love this. app. I use it more than I thought I would!
B00C7NKPPS|5.0|The sonic quality is drastically improved over the original CDs (I have two 'original versions' to which I can compare this 2013 remaster).  I never looked to see who actually did the audio remastering but they did a great job. The highs are much clearer and the overall loudness is 'bigger' but not pushed beyond the point of having subtlety.  Great packaging and great performances of McCartney at his post-Beatles peak.
0857685848|5.0|Hi:<br /><br />  In regards to the Book Titled, Dinosaur Art; It's a wonderful book which shows what life on Planet Earth may have<br />looked like 225 - 60 million years ago. I highly recommend this book for the budding Paleontologist as a reference<br />book. It will give them some idea of the fauna (Plant Life) and the way animals coexisted with one another at this<br />time in Earth History.<br /><br />Bob.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|The wait was definitely worth it! A must see for all Lord of the Rings fans. I loved that it had a little humor, too.
1432794426|5.0|Thank you for this amazing book, Dr. Karen Moriarty. I was so touched when I was reading it, and felt that you have put your heart into the book. It could bring closer to me Michael's wonderful \\"Earthly Angel Being\\", and I loved feeling it by your book. And I got new ideas and motivation for some \\"new SunflowerBeat symbols\\", so thank you so much... I feel that your book is really worthy of Michael's Legacy, and can show those parts of him what not too much people know. It is a real insight... and a Gate to see his real Life and everydays.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Really awesome game!!!!!!!! I love it because I've always wanted a horse and now I feel like I have one!!!!
B00873GRU4|3.0|Interesting concept, but the entire story is bleak and does not promise anything other! Some flaws with the concept of civilisation living underground. Why have only a staircase for over 160 levels of living? How did the population survive living underground without Vitamin D?<br />Not sure that I would follow the 'Trilogy', the first book needed to offer some promise. Also noted that central characters, mostly the good guys get bumped off, very early in the piece, just when you are identifying with their personalities!!!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I was reading reviews on Notepad plus, and liked it, but was not ready to buy, when I decided to research the various note taking things I had already purchased, free or not.  The one I could paste into, but the print out was too small.  Then I saw this one, and opened it, and discovered it would do what Note pad plus does, AND allows the paste feature, as well, as coloring my notes.  I can title each note I put in there, and add to it as needed.  Really a BIG help.  The best is that the font is BIG, much more comfortable for older eyes.  Reduces eye strain !  There are so many note taking apps out there, it is hard to find one that you can stick to and honestly really use.  But THIS one, I know I will use ALOT!  WOO!
B00CWV8TIU|2.0|very boring,dull story and it is so drawn out.. a waste of time to sit thur..looked like everything about this movie was old
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I was really hoping for more answers and the end of the trilogy.  The story was drawn out and not enough detail given to the existing story from the previous books.  I feel this book was just a door opening to the now reported 4th and 5th book.  Very disappointed that we will have another loooooonnnnggg wait for the rest of the story.  No way was this book worth $9.99.  It should have been a $5.00 book.  I will pay close attention to the reviews of the next book before I spend any more money on this series.  If they are sup-par then I will cut my losses and move on to another author.<br />I did like the first two books very much and feel gyped.
B0050DZN4K|4.0|I've tried most of the readers and/or aggregators and Feedly combines the best in style and substance. I am more concerned with content (over 1000 feeds) and Feedly's presentation is clean, logical and easily configurable.
0061950726|4.0|I think I'd heard of how in the 1920's orphans were sent from the East Coast to places in the mid-west to 'save' them. This book, although it is fiction, shows that probably lots of people 'adopted' these orphans to use them as workers, almost slaves. Too many times we just throw away our children with good intention...we're still doing that.<br />Really enjoyed to book, it's well-written, the story is absorbing.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is sooo fun. Way to short but gets your mind moving. Cant wait for more<br />rooms and floors to escape from!!
B00CXL6XP0|5.0|Really like this album ! .... Reminds me of the OPERATION MINDCRIME / EMPIRE Era of Queensryche .... The New Singer is really good . I DO like this version of QUEENSRYCHE better than what GEOFF TATE has released . Silly to have 2 bands using the Name . BUY THIS if you like ORIGINAL Melodic Metal sounding QUEENSYCHE , .... Also buy the Alubums fro MAGNITUDE 9 here on Amazon MP3 if you like this style .
B004GUSG4M|4.0|I simply could not put it down!  This was a great read to start my summer off right! Check it out!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It was good. But if you really like this book read Divergent and Insurgent. And in October read the third book Allegent. By Veronica Roth.
B0031RS2XG|5.0|This is an amazing book, I almost ate it. It's very interesting, and the scientific text and all studies are explained in a simple but not stupid way, and the clinics make it also practical.<br />Great advice for everybody who works in advertising or sales, and great read for everybody else.
B0064J6PMI|5.0|Fast moving and funny, keeps you on your toes.  Very entertaining.  Was planning on just watching just a bit but could not turn it off as it was so good.<br /><br />Fun, fun, fun
B00CXN2JNS|5.0|Megadeth has always had hard pounding, driving metal flowing through their veins, but there have been times when they lost any real sense of melody. With Super Collider, they are back in the perfect groove for my musical tastes. Solid metal, great melody, and Dave's semi-manic vocals in perfect form. I love this album.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I Think that Minecraft is a very entertaining app. I play it often and enjoy every time. I strongly recommend downloading this. I f you do you will enjoy it.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Very peaceful  fun to experiment with different combinations.  Have to say that this makes for a restful and pleasing slumber. Thanks
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I think this app is fun. I wish their were more levels though.I would recommend getting this awesome puzzle app.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|if you into some soft porn story this is a great book to read. its not perfect but it has you wondering what will happen next.
B0014JGDUC|4.0|no slip sole works great and my back doesn't hurt. i have slender feet so they drag when i walk but i've been wearing them 40+ hours a week for about 6 months and they're still going strong.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|When I heard that Geoff and the band parted ways and the resulting fallout, I was divided. I really couldn't imagine a Ryche without Tate. Would this be like the 1994 Motley Crue album, where the departure of Vince Neil was not received well by fans? I feared it would.<br /><br />Instead, this is like Van Halen. The sound - the Queensryche sound - is so much more than just the lead vocals, and this album proves it. For every album since HITNF, I've listened to it all the way through, and then found myself not remembering a single stand-out song. They were all forgettable.<br /><br />Then, this past spring, I heard \\"Redemption.\\" It had such a classic QR sound, that I knew it had to have been a B-side or something from an earlier era. When I found out that it was from the \\"new\\" Queensryche, I was ecstatic. But then again, would that be an anomaly? Anyone can write a good song; would they have enough other good material to make a good album?<br /><br />I have listened to this album over and over. There's not a bad song on the disc. They're all memorable. My favorites are Where Dreams Go To Die, Spore, Redemption, Vindication, and In This Light. Not since Mindcrime has there been a QR disc that I haven't wanted to skip past at least one song; this is a complete disc to listen to over and over again in its entirety.<br /><br />As I said, I didn't want to like this album. I wanted both incarnations of QR to fail, so that they could come back together and return to the traditional lineup. I'm pleased to be proven wrong. *THIS* is Queensryche. Like Van Halen, this album proves that the sound is more than just a lead singer.<br /><br />If you loved Queensryche in the early 90s, give this album a listen. This is classic Queensryche. I'm glad they're back.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game but on artic when you reach 395miles its is imposible to go over the hill.But overall it is a great game I think you should get.
B001OG3VOQ|4.0|takes me back to a simpler time. I used to listen to it over and over. this was her best work by far, before she got all thankful and sissy.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I couldn't put it down!! This was a phenomenally suspenseful book. A real page turner! My attention was held through the entire thing!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game it worked your mind and it made you think some of it was hard but I love it cant wait to get more
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is wonderful!!!  Once you start you want more levels to challenge yourself.  A level of difficulty that does nof take away the fun and so sayisfying when you complete the level.  I can not wait til more come!!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is not as easy as it looks but that's okay because it challenges the mind and that what I enjoy the most about this game.
B00AO686MY|5.0|I recently took a look at one of my all-time favorite films, recently released on Blu-ray, Who Framed Roger Rabbit. I must say that it is held up extremely well after nearly a quarter of a century, and remains, in my opinion, one of the best films ever made. The plot is a classic whodunit made in the style of 1940s noir, like The Maltese Falcon, a style that it captures quite well. The plot does keep you guessing (assuming you've never seen it before), with clues and red herrings aplenty. The protagonist Eddie Valiant, played by Bob Hoskins in a superb performance, has the perfect accent and outlook to pull off the closed off hard-boiled detective type. Christopher Lloyd as the villain Judge Doom is another perfect casting, as a threatening and formidable threat to the safety of Toontown.<br /><br />What propels this film to its legendary status is the unbelievable and unparalleled cinematography. The audience's suspension of disbelief is complete and all encompassing, as you truly do believe that these cartoon characters are interacting with the real world. The shadows match, the perspective matches, essentially everything about these cartoons is made to look real part from the celluloid. Roger Rabbit and the fellow citizens of Toontown, who range from all of the different animation houses of the era from Disney to Warner Bros. and beyond, are believable in their presence and personalities, which all stay true to the original incarnations. The effects are so great that the cartoons can even interact with real-world objects, and the objects move believably. Helped by all of this are the actors' performances, who all behave as those cartoons are really in the room. Behind the scenes, the voice actors really were in the room, lending to the realism of the dialogue. All in all, this film is as close to perfect, I believe, as a film can get.<br /><br />The extras for the Blu-ray release a great too. It includes all of the documentaries from earlier DVD releases, so nothing is lost in the upgrade. Also included are the original Roger rabbit shorts that appeared in front of Disney films in the early 1990s, which are all great and stay true to the tone of the film. This really is a great film and a great release, worth every penny of the purchase price. I give it my highest recommendation for any film lover, animation lover, or just anybody who likes cartoons from when they were a kid.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|I wish more movies could come out to be as great quality, this movie made me go into detective mode and RDJ's interpetation of Holmes doesn't disappoint.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I'm 21 and got this for my 6 year old sister to play with in the doctors office. She loved it. The is lots to do and its not too hard for her to have fun but it is challenging enough to keep her interest. It's actually really cute, I even play it from time to time and have fun.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|I wasn't expecting this movie to be as good as it was it does contain a few swear words here and there but overall it gives a different more realistic take on the story of &#34;Jack and the Giant Beanstalk.&#34;
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I Love love love love this book!  I have read dozens of books on the LOA and this is by far the best. Well written, with common sense and humour, and a no nonsense and non-religious approach.  Takes the myth and mystery out of the law of attraction, making it accessible for everyone.<br />Buy it .
B00CL0J99K|5.0|Iron Man 3 wow what a awesome film it is. The visual effects , Special Effects , music and story , and cast was so great and the movie was well put together. Robert Downey Jr is great as Iron Man and I hope he stay's on for more films for both Iron Man and The Avengers you can't replace him RDJ is Iron Man. Iron Man 3 is a awesome great film.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|this app is terrible. do not waste your time getting it. its hard to control and you have to unlovk stuff using real money. if you want a really good hair salon game i recommend toca hair salon 2.
B008JFUPK8|4.0|Man of Steel is a awesome film to watch. Henry Cavill as Superman / Clark Kent was good also Amy Adams Lois Lane was good as well. And also the Story was fun and the special effects where good and did not take you out of the movie. Hans Zimmer's score was good but I still perfer John Williams Superman The Movie score over Man of Steel. And aside from some pacing issues the film works. So overall Man of Steel is off to a great start to re start Superman as a film series. I look forward to seeing this again on Blu-Ray Disc soon. And I can't wait for the sequel of Man of Steel in 2 to 3 years. Man of Steel is awesome!!!!
B00CWV8TIU|1.0|Boring.Could not even finish it was so boring! This was supposed to be a thriller. There was nothing thrilling about it! What a waste of time and money.
B007CFL4WO|3.0|While generally the opposite, there are times when the book a movie is based on fails to move me as much as the movie. Such is the case with The Reader, Bernhard Schlink's bestselling novel about Michael Berg and his relationship with Hanna Schmidt in the decades after WWII.<br /><br />The story is the same with few alterations, none of which are major. However, the style is slow moving with little dialogue and many descriptive passages and internal monologues as the first person Michael looks back on the choices he has made and the repercussions they have made on his life. It is bittersweet with occasional moments of brilliant insight, but also possesses too much wistfulness and unnecessary description.<br /><br />The movie works better because it puts dialogue to the novel's reflective passages, and thus makes the movie more enjoyable than the navel-gazing which is at times monotonous and dull. Schlink's writing certainly has some depth and observation but it is unfortunately too self-indulgent to build any momentum.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the movie as I did, the novel is something you'd probably enjoy reading, albeit not as much as the film experience. I never felt pulled to the characters as I did during the movie. 3.5 stars.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|This movie arrived in great time and my daughter simply loves it! It will get plenty of use in our house for many years to come! Great story.
B002DQLGHU|4.0|My wife just reread the whole series of books, but has never seen it in film.  She was happy with the interpretation, from book to screen,  It was good enough to get and keep the attention of my 15y old daughter as well.
B004KPX4W2|3.0|The story line is Die-Hard with another title.  Bruce is a good guy who has been painted bad by someone and then he has to find a way to fight back against unbelievable odds.  He incorporates the help of some previous friends to help him out and in the end is vindicated.  If you just want some action without having to think much in the movie then this is for you.
B000TERK14|5.0|I first heard them by accident, and had to buy the album after sampling all the songs. Really like this album!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|What more could I ask for?  Sanderson wove the story threads masterfully while not losing the excitement of the last battle. There was poetry, humor and lots of heart. I loved it.
B00CS7ZIHI|2.0|After buying their other works, I bought this one too. Disappointed. Wish they had stayed with what worked. Maybe next time.
1401937268|5.0|I love these cards. The booklet inside is informative and so super helpful. The cards are accurate and are not broad spectrum which I've seen in other sets. I love them and use them often for myself and others with scarily accurate results.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|fun great different. !!!!!  love it!!!!!! I have almost all of these kinds of games. makes you think. I like to see how fast I can play. !!!!
B0089OBLDO|2.0|I've been playing with it for awhile using for my xbox360 controller on the ps3 and sometimes it just resets itself as if it locked the controller for a second and unlocked it. But wasn't my ps3 controller as i had replaced it. I tried contacting Mayflash but they hadn't replied to me in a week or so. Buy this adapter at your own risk.
B007WMI1X2|5.0|This excellent BBC series is fun, entertaining and amazing clever in that its humor works at both the adult and child's level. I've studied English History yet I'm continually amazed of new things I learn & cultural nuances that they bring up. I wish PBS or BBC America would import it for US markets.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I'm generally pleased with this addition to the Tolkien collection of movies. It has the same great special effects that were so prevalent in the Fellowship of the Ring series. But their are a few instances where it does stray away from the books storyline! Other than that its a fun and exciting movie to watch! Can't wait for the others to come out!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love hidden object and puzzle games. This was fun. Note: have a pen and paper handy to write down the clues as you go. I just wish it had more levels, so looks like I would be downloading more of the puzzles!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Great book! A fascinating story, gripping drama, and our introduction to the character of Jack Reacher. Well worth the read
B009949RKC|5.0|You can never go wrong with a classic - love the film and just wanted to see it again before cathing the remake coming out this year. AWESOME movie!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I love this ho game.  Great graphics, makes you think. Awesome plot. Keep up the good work. Worth every cent.
B002SHD9E2|4.0|This depends on whether or not you like musicals - obviously it's got a ton of singing involved.  I LOVE Gerard Butler in this film and the other two main characters are very good. Note - don't watch this if you're sleepy you probably will fall asleep with all the singing.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|This is a spoiler and for readers who have already seen the movie...<br /><br />Basically, Peter Jackson brings back most of the cast of Lord of the Rings, and does little else that is new with them all. Even the hawks saving the day at the end is a dead copy of what came before.<br /><br />There are too many dwarves to keep track of.<br /><br />Bilbo Baggins has nothing like the task of Frodo the ring bearer. His grand arc is to discover the bravery within.<br /><br />The final escape is done for the heroes, by Gndalf's magic and elvish (Cate Blanchet's) help.<br /><br />Too easy, too facile,.. as is the writing.<br /><br />Beautiful to watch however.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|He is a good country singer and his songs sound great.He is enjoyable to watch and listen to.<br />Like country music
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I think Mr. Hosseini is a lyrical writer and I loved The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns.  The story here did not capture me with as much interest but the character development and descriptive phraseology are wonderful.  My biggest criticism is that the story is very fractured by time, characters, and locations and was hard to follow each story at times.  I did enjoy the descriptions of life in Afghanistan and its people and I think this story intended, and did, to make them current and parallel to us in wants and needs.  The human condition displayed is much like our own, love, disappointment, generosity, courage and in addition the stamina through the political and war upheavals in their country.  I liked the book and would recommend it to anyone.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Sometimes it takes me several pages or even chapters to get immersed in a story.  I was spellbound from page one of &#34;And The Mountains Echoed.&#34;  Without being too wordy, Hosseini has the ability to create vivid and unique characters.  I was interested in and cared about each one.  Many of the stories were sad and sometimes the heroes were not who I thought they would be.<br /><br />The book was in some respects more like a collection of short stories about people whose lives were interconnected in random ways.  Each story could stand on its own separately, but at the end I stood back mentally and emotionally and saw all the stories woven together into a beautiful tapestry of life.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft pocket edition is the best game ever invented I play it almost all day every day its so fun even my 4 year old sister plays it! mojang rocks
B000UX6OHK|1.0|For a watch that costed me a hunderd dollars I excepting it to be silver at least with more weight to it.  Very disappointed when it arrived.
0545405777|5.0|This book is wonderful! I read the entire book (except for the last few pages) on a flight home from Hawaii and actually wanted to sit on the plane to finish it! It is that good! The movie is great too, but the book is always better!
0062255657|3.0|While Neil Gaiman's storytelling is always very beautifully done, I was a mildly disappointed with Ocean at the End of the Lane.  I read in the epilogue that the book was originally poised to be a short story--and that shows.  It felt exactly like I read a short story.  There was very little character development, and I was left wanting more from the story.<br /><br />It also didn't feel very adult to me.  There are a few scenes thrown in that indeed make it adult, but it didn't read that way.  Seemed like the adult scenes were somewhat of an afterthought so it could be sold as adult fiction.<br /><br />If you are expecting one of the epic worlds and tales that Gaiman usually creates, it's not in this book.  While I still think it was beautifully written and enjoyed it, I was left a bit disappointed.<br /><br />I hope this is helpful!
B009JZORSI|5.0|Nothing like the original Star Trek cast!  I love this quirky movie.  All the computerized special effects of today can't touch the classics!
B009OA57MI|5.0|I like how it is able to give realistic realism to anybody who loves simulator games and I would advise anybody to buy it!!!<br />Although I think it would be cool if they put air to air combat with other aircraft :)
B005FMZWD8|4.0|Superou minhas expectativas quanto a entrega, chegou antes do combinado. Relógio realmente bonito, chama atenção e caí muito bem para usá-lo no dia a dia. O que notei, como um ponto fraco, é que sua pulseira parece ser frágil e em poucos usos já apresenta marcas de desgaste.<br /><br />Exceeded my expectations for delivery, arrived ahead of schedule. Watch really beautiful, draws attention and fell nicely to use it on a daily basis. What I noticed as a weakness, is that your bracelet looks fragile and few uses already has wear marks.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|This book is exactly why I could not get through 2 pages of the self-indulgent, premeditated narrative in Eat, Pray, Love, written after the author got an advance. Strayed is the real deal: True grit. Feminine, sensitive yet stalwart. Vulnerable. Bendable but not breakable. Some of the most breathtaking passages I've read in ages, composed without self pity.
B004ZNB12O|5.0|People who decide that they are 'dissapointed' with this PF collection, probably don't even consider the 'LYRICS', If they don't, they are missing the entire 'POINT' of PF's contribution. Amazon has a price that I would pay locally, but our stores were 'out of stock'. It cost me extra for shipping, but that was 'made up' by Amazon's 'Autorip' digital download. I was able to 'download' the music that I had purchased, for all my 'devices'. GOOD SHOW !
B00CW665VI|5.0|Love the point of view in telling the story. Really brought the characters to life!!! Give it a try...you won't be disappointed!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's the best I love playing this game I never stop and it's made for all ages once you start you can't stop and I didn't spend a single dime
B000HC2LI0|5.0|This is the coolest thing. When  you open the box each season is its own folder.... like in a file cabinet. There is a script and episode guide in addition to the 45 discs. I am so glad I bought this!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that this game is amazing for kids because it's enjoyable and each time you play this game you want to do it again and it is very entertaining
B0030BCCB6|5.0|The price was a bargain and it sounds much better than I remember. Peter Green and the unmistakable tone will make sure you are not disappointed.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think it would be the yonas because I love my self and I like video games and that's all
B0018BB21G|5.0|There are several Moody Blues classics, and this happens to my favorite. Another CD with bonuses that are worth the extra space.
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|Seen previews of this movie on TV but decided to wait and watch it once on DVD this is another movie I didn't mine purchasing
B00007LTIG|5.0|The quality is so much better than a scratched record, and the bonus tracks are right up my alley. Viola Lee Blues: three versions including the killer long jam.
B002ZG97LK|5.0|I really liked this Footloose as well some things we're not as good as the first one but other than that it was great movie
B000002AGB|5.0|The sound is great, and all the player were &#34;on&#34; this performance. I really like how Tommy songs are weaved within the classics and I played it 5 times the first week.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a great book from begin to end.  Enjoyed getting to know the characters.  Looking forward to reading the remaining books and seeing the movie.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Best show ever!! Nathan Fillion is excellent as is the rest of the cast. Look forward to each new episode.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Yes! The twin-guitar melodies are back, a lead singer who's voice has not degraded is back! The 'Ryche is back! This is the best 'Ryche release since Promised land. The only complaint I have is that it's too short!<br /><br />La Torre is a much better singer than Tate now (though not better than Tate in his prime).<br /><br />The sound is like a modernized version of the classic 'Ryche sound; I'd give it 4.5 stars, but since that's not possible, I'm going with 5.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Very cute game. The horses look and act real.<br />Enjoyable for any age. I am nearly 40 and I love this game,children would too.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Devilishly fun time waster!  Patiently waiting for new levels. Not to easy, not to hard, just right. If your looking to think and play at the same time then this is for you.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|The classic Queensryche sound returns and the band sounds inspired again. If you've been disappointed with just about everything after Promised Land, then this is the disc for you. I can't wait to hear what they come up with next.
B00DBSZEH2|5.0|A nice revisioning of a children's story but this is no fairy tale. Lots of action and twists. A good story and very good acting. Well worth your time.
B00BESM14U|4.0|Great little film, overall.  Several of the plot devices have been used to tears, but they presented them in such a way to still make them touching and interesting.  The music was definitely great, and the actors were top notch.  I'd recommend it to my friends for sure.
B008QPCCQQ|5.0|An excellent assortment of Louis May Alcott's work. Would highly recommend the download of this ebook. Especially since its free right now on kindle.

0307476073|5.0|I felt like I made the journey with Cheryl. When I read a memoir this realized, I always feel odd when I run into the author, like somehow we can friends while I was reading her memoir.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|I've read all three in the trilogy and I really loved them. The character development is authentic, the dialogue is very smooth, world-building is fantastic, action scenes are awesome... I could go on and on. Really, REALLY loved this trilogy.

B008EKOO46|5.0|Ok, everyone didn't agree with Mr. Diamond's conclusions in Collapse, but it made you dig into things a little deeper, didn't it.  The same folks who dismissed Mr. Diamond's ideas previously, will no doubt, pick this one to death, but he makes some valid parallels between traditional (hunter-gatherer) societies and more modern ones.  It is well worth your time, and if you haven't read Guns, Germs and Steel or Collapse, you should.
1594132054|1.0|I ordered this book for a summer reading project, which gave me the choice of reading this book or two others. After picking this one & getting it in the mail I began reading & realized it was HORRIBLE. I tried to tough it out but after 200 pages I finally broke down and ordered a different one to read instead. Just be aware, If you make it through section one you will cringe at the sight of corn for weeks.
1936608898|3.0|\\"It Starts with Food\\" advocates that people eat three meals a day of meat and vegetables while staying away from whole grains, legumes, processed food, sugar, and hydrogenated oils.  Such a diet is more commonly known as the Paleo Diet or the Caveman Diet, and is extremely popular with practitioners of Crossfit, high-achievers who are always looking to build lean muscle.  But the authors never mention the Paleo Diet, and in fact I think they'd take great offense if their Whole30 recommendations were labeled simply as the Caveman Diet for 30 days.<br /><br />That's because the authors take great -- perhaps to the point of excruciating -- pains to explain that their diet is based on precise science on how the body works.  There are two issues with this approach.<br /><br />First, the authors are neither food scientists nor physiologists, and sometimes their scientific explanations do not quite make sense, and sometimes they're just factually wrong.  For example, in the book, they state that there are 21 essential amino acids that the body cannot manufacture on its own, and therefore must obtain through food -- in fact, there are 22 amino acids, 9 of which are essential.  This may seem like nitpicking, but the authors should be extremely precise and careful when they're trying to pass themselves off as scientific authority.<br /><br />The second issue is much more troubling:  Modern science simply does not know that much about how the body works.  There are a lot of reasons for this.  First, the human body is far more complicated and integrated than science can grapple with.  Modern science has a tendency to want to separate the whole into its constituent parts, and understand the function of each part.  But with the human body it's also impossible to do so because the parts function in relation to each other, and indeed can change function depending on which other parts it's interacting with.  Second, nowadays a lot of scientific research is hijacked by food corporations (Monsanto, for example).  Third, scientists aren't as competent as we gave them credit for.  Two and three mean that a lot of the scientific knowledge about the body and the food that's coming out nowadays are either contradictory (butter is bad for you, butter is good for you) or just plain dubious (organic food isn't healthier than conventional food).<br /><br />The authors completely ignore the flimsy state of our modern understanding of food, and just stick to their script.  In their humble opinion, they have found the optimal diet that is the panacea for everyone's ills.  Rather than changing the lifestyles of the sedentary and obese (those who most need nutritional guidance) this book will probably just make Cross-fitters already too agitated and anxious over-achievers even more obsessive-compulsive about their lifestyles.<br /><br />There's a lot of counter-arguments to this book, and here's mine:  \\"People have managed to live happy and healthy lives throughout the world where food was limited.  They have done so while enjoying their food.  So eat fresh local produce.  Eat different colors of vegetables.  Enjoy your food, and don't fret.  There's no perfect or optimal, and you'll only stress yourself out trying to achieve too much.\\"

B00992CF6W|4.0|Two of my grandkids love Minecraft. It is not the full version that they have on their own devices at home but it is enough.to keep me in the loop of knowing the language and skills kids learn from it. I can at least have a conversation with the kids about it and am amazed at the vocabulary they have built around the game.

B009XIXVU6|5.0|Having enjoyed The Kite Runner, I was up for another in-depth read and was not disappointed.  The characters became imbedded in my mind..... vivid descriptions, episodes, and details to delight.
B002DQLGHU|3.0|I read two of the Harry Potter series via my Kindle Fire - loaned thru Amazon Prime...of course I had to see the first movie to visualize the characters and be prepared for grandson conversations......  That was it -- fun for  that purpose, not too sure if I'll return for the remainder of the series but you never know when a dull spot may occur in my reading and Amazon Prime makes it sooooo easy!
1609611543|5.0|Wow after reading this book now I understand why after many attempts to lose weight I couldn't. The book is very detailed, but I think this helps to understand the science behind his assertions. Diabetics or those with chronic ilness especially should read this book. I think it will answer those questions you have always had and put you on a path to better health and more energy and a better life.

B009XIXVU6|2.0|This author is apparently a &#34;one hit wonder...or maybe Two hit&#34;. This book does not hold a candle to Kite Runner as it is shallow and disjointed. The opposite of an &#34;easy read&#34;.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I'm sad that the series has ended, but this was the way to end it and tie all the ends into a nice bow.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I was captivated from the very first line of this wonderful novel. Hosseini is a masterful story teller, and held my attention from beginning to end.
B0000DZTIL|3.0|As this movie was always in my top one hundred and will remain there it has lost a little of its luster compared with today's movie standards. It still brings me smiles and laughter, but just doesn't stand up to the fond memories I self imposed as my new standards have obviously excelled. I would definitely recommend this movie for those looking to bring back childhood memories or to the video collected.

1451696191|5.0|I loved this book! I actually wish I could go back in time and give a copy to my 16 year old self. I think that this is an important book-especially for teenagers.<br />This book deals with a lot of issues: abuse, drugs, mental illness sex, coming out, and more but that's not all you get from this book. It is beautifully written, funny, and when it's all over-leaves you with a sense of peace.<br />I highly suggest this for anyone really. It's a great book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this series -- and so happy it is available on Amazon Prime.  I always forget when Downton is on -- and this allows me to watch the whole season so easily.  No waiting each week for what will happen next.  The series shows the passing of time and the changing of attitudes as it rolls on.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I really like this game, it keeps the mind aware and is a way of keeping it sharp, as I said a fun game

B0050DIWFC|4.0|Good book, fast read!  You gotta like courtroom mumbo/jumbo, because there's a lot of that.  I would recommend this book to someone who is looking for something suspenseful. Subject touches somewhat on bullying, but doesn't drag the plow too deep!
B003ZJ70W4|5.0|I never watched the series, but this movie fills the viewer in on the important details of what was missed in the series.
B002W1UEW4|1.0|This movie had such cheesy acting and a really lame story line. I didn't even bother finishing the last 30 minutes.
B001ECQ75A|5.0|Jack Black does an excellent job voicing the main character. Other famous people (Jackie Chan, Angelina Jolie) also lend their vocal talents.

B00CM9JKQM|5.0|I've said it elsewhere, and I'll say it again here: \\"Queensryche\\" is the best Queensryche album since Operation: Mindcrime. Not the best since Empire, or Promised Land - I'm talkin' Mindcrime, pal. Oh, there are elements of each of those subsequent classics on Queensryche, but it just all comes together so well here.<br /><br />Okay, first things first. I had (like so many others) lost faith in Queensryche. I purchased Hear In the Now Frontier. Actually, that was the last tour I had seen them on voluntarily. Skipped out on Q2K - didn't do it for me. Came back for Tribe, still not right.<br /><br />Got duped into Operation:Mindcrime 2 - WTF?!  Never again, I vowed.  Heard samples of American Soldier & Dedicated to Chaos - ugh, I figured the well of creativity had run dry. Hey, it happens. Look at Metallica, Megadeth, etc.<br /><br />Little did I know that someone was intentionally blocking that well ...<br /><br />So some stuff  (finally) went down in Queensryche land over the last year (everyone knows the story) and here we are gifted with AN ABSOLUTELY AMAZING QUEENSRYCHE ALBUM!!!<br /><br />It feels so damn good to say that.<br /><br />I've been listening to this album pretty much non-stop for just about a week (thanks CM Distro!) and this is the real deal: the harmony twin guitar parts, impassioned vocals with inspired melodic lines, driving riffs, tastefully technical drums, and that familiar rumbling bass tone holding it all together. And most importantly, incredibly well written and performed SONGS. Oh yeah, Jimbo Barton too!<br /><br />Listening to Queensryche brings me right back to how I felt when I first got my grubby mitts on Rage for Order, or when I first heard the now-legendary Mindcrime back in '88. It has that \\"X\\" factor that had somehow disappeared.<br /><br />I'm not gonna get into a song-by-song review; buy the album and hear the proof for your own damn self: Queensryche are back. Yeah, that Queensryche. The one that had been missing for so long.<br /><br />Hey Todd, Parker, Edbass, Mike & Scott: welcome back. It's about freakin' time.<br /><br />Vindication indeed.

0765325950|5.0|Started this series in college, and after being a follower for 10 years, it was so nice to finish it.  I was pleasantly surprised with the closure of so many story lines, and like others, had questions about other story lines, but that's the beauty of thiis series:).
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Just as wonderful as Seasons 1 and 2.  Thoroughly enjoyed this 3 DVD set of Season 3.  We enjoy the show so much, it's well worth the money to us.  Very anxious for Season 4!  If it were up to me, the cast of Downton Abbey would get very few breaks in production.  :)  I could watch the series year-round.  BBC/Masterpiece, keep it coming.  PLEASE.  (Oh - and LOVE the ladies' costumes.  They are absolutely dreamy dresses.)
0091949300|4.0|\\"The Untold History of the United States,\\" a collaboration between filmmaker Oliver Stone and historian Peter Kuznick, yields a masterful account of U.S. political history and presents a perspective rarely seen in corporate media.<br /><br />The book and associated TV documentary series follows the tenures of U.S. presidents from Woodrow Wilson to Barack Obama and gives a critical account of their efficacy, decision making, policies, diplomacy and courage during their time in the world's top job.<br /><br />No punches are pulled in the proffering of presidential report cards and few presidents receive pass marks on the assessment of Stone and Kuznick.<br /><br />The xenophobia and paranoia of the United States and that manifestation of those traits through presidential decisions, which are inordinately swayed by the immense influence of military advisors, rapacious corporate leaders and right-wing nut-jobs on political policy, is well presented in the book. The benefit of hindsight is a wonderful thing in this regard, but the decision-making process of U.S. leaders beggars belief with its blatant disregard for human rights, compassion and in many cases, legal grounding.<br /><br />Stone and Kuznick detail U.S. corporate sponsorship of both sides of both world wars and how the nation profited from the misery of others. Much copy is given also to the manipulation of the governments of other countries by U.S. intelligence agencies to overthrow democratically elected leaders and replace them with puppets in line with U.S. corporate and economic interests.<br /><br />Also evident is the total unsuitability of many U.S. presidents to hold the office, Harry S. Truman and George W. Bush are revealed to have been highly unqualified for the office of U.S. president...Ronald Wilson Reagan, Lyndon Baines Johnson, and Richard Milhous Nixon were also questionably qualified for the position. However, the book outlines well that the president is merely one of many shaping U.S. policy and that the figurehead leader is subjected to the machinations of a myriad advisors and consultants many of whom have ulterior motives in swaying presidential directives.<br /><br />It is also well covered in the book that there have been many inspired leaders who could have shaped a more compassionate and admirable United States and positioned the powerful nation into the world with the respect rather than the fear of other nations and their people. Henry Wallace was such a leader, but his policies were considered too dove-like by the hawks and he was effectively railroaded out of office before he could implement any policies that may limit U.S. global hegemony. An advocate of social equity and a staunch anti-imperialist, Wallace was a very popular vice-president to Franklin D. Roosevelt during WWII and may have become President had the Republican guard not determined his \\"utopian\\" ideology was unsuitable to further their political ends.  Harry Truman was given the vice-presidential nomination despite only a 2% support base. Wallace polled 65%.<br /><br />Roosevelt went on to win a second term and died in office a short time later, which made Truman president, Wallace missed out by a mere 82 days. Truman went on to do such things as drop atom bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and effectively start the Cold War with Russia, decisions which perhaps would have been avoided should Wallace have assumed the presidency.<br /><br />The Vietnam Way years are given a lot of coverage in the book, perhaps because Oliver Stone saw active service there. Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, and Richard Nixon all held office during the debacle of the Vietnam War. The sheer obstinacy of U.S. foreign policy is revealed in that way the conflict was handled. Numerous opportunities to withdraw were ignored on the grounds that bringing the troops home would be seen as a sign of weakness and that the United States must win at any cost to ensure the worldknows who is boss and to rid the world of Communism. The destruction of three countries; Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos ensued, the expenditure of billions of dollars and the loss of over 5 million lives could have been avoided if the United States swallowed its pride and accepted political philosophies other than their own.<br /><br />The Cold War and the proliferation of nuclear arms are detailed well in the book. The insanity of having weapons stockpiled that could destroy the entire world 50 times over and lead to the annihilation of every living breathing thing of Earth...and the numerous times such a dystopian possibility came close to becoming reality is chillingly reveled. Military lobbyists, right-wing hawks and industrialists again shaped U.S. policy and manipulated presidential decisions in their favour...which leads us to the George W. Bush/Dick Cheney years, which put other presidential failures in the shade in terms of legal breeches, military spending, corporate pandering, personal avarice and blatant incompetency.<br /><br />Finally, President Barack Obama, who has had real opportunities to right many of the wrongs of the Bush/Cheney administration and beyond. He was seen as a great hope by the people of the United States and the world to bring about a new era of U.S. leadership and take the nation forward in a positive and proactive fashion, but has thus far failed on all counts. His capitulation to Wall Street over the finance industry engineered banking crisis, his failure to close Guantanamo Bay prison facility as promised (yielding again to military counsel), his increased covert surveillance of U.S citizens private information and the use of drones to eliminate perceived enemies and lots of innocent civilians in the process, has not lived up to the promise he showed and his actions have even served to exacerbate the perceived terrorist threat to the United States.<br /><br />The pursuit of whistle-blowers like WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, U.S. Marine Bradley Manning and now Edward Snowden again presents Obama with an opportunity to reengineer U.S. policy toward greater transparency and to live up to the land of the brave home of the free dictum that has long been a satirical platitude in the United States.<br /><br />The Untold History of the United States should be at the very least compulsory reading for any aspiring U.S. president in the hope that they will know that their office is under public scrutiny and acceptance of political lies and obfuscation is no longer acceptable to a increasingly aware, thinking and unified populace...as evidenced by the recent \\"Occupy\\" movement.<br /><br />Stone and Kuznick dedicate the book to their children in the hope that a better world results from its publication...this is perhaps a lofty and overly optimistic expectation, but they have put the U.S. government on notice and it's about time!

1416583432|4.0|INSIDE OF A DOG was a fascinating and informative read, and probably would be for any \\"dog-owner,\\" or, if that's already a politically incorrect term, then for anyone who has ever shared his or her life with a dog. And there have been dogs around for most of my life, so I certainly qualify. Yeah, I liked Alexandra Horowitz's scientific study of canine behavior. If it doesn't contain all the answers on why dogs do the things they do, it certainly gives you plenty to gnaw on, and entertains you in the process. There are plenty of \\"yes\\" moments in the book, like \\"Barking can be contagious ... one dog barking might prompt a chorus of barking dogs, all joined in their shared noisiness.\\" That's an \\"OH, yes\\" statement I can heartily agree with. Walking around the block with my two dogs I know of nearly two dozen dogs in that four-block stretch. Those other dogs often all take note of our walk and, well, yeah, \\"a chorus of barking dogs.\\" (This reminded me of something I read somewhere about a guy who had devised a special collar for dogs which 'translated' their barks. Turned out they were all saying: \\"hey! hey! HEY!\\")<br /><br />Or, conversely, here's another favorite bit -<br /><br />\\"... it is the very fact that they do not use language that makes me especially treasure dogs. Their silence can be one of their most endearing traits ... There is no awkwardness in a shared silent moment with a dog: a gaze from the dog on the other side of the room; lying sleepily alongside of each other. It is when language stops that we connect most fully.\\"<br /><br />Perhaps my favorite chapter here was toward the end, \\"You Had Me at Hello.\\" In it Horowitz states: \\"Often it is contact that draws us to animals. Our sense of touch ...\\" Again, an 'aha' moment of recognition for me. Our most recent dog, adopted from the local shelter, is a delicately leggy Boston Terrier-Chihuahua mix. Emmy was not at all the kind of dog we were looking for, but she was the only dog in the place who wasn't barking, which intrigued me. Upon being let out of her cage, she shyly approached me, stood up on her hind legs and placed just one front foot ever so softly upon my knee. Touch. She had me even withOUT Hello. Emmy has owned me for just over a year now.<br /><br />Horowitz is a psychologist and specializes in animal behavior. But she is also a doglover. Me too. If I have any complaints about INSIDE OF A DOG, it's that it can be on occasion a bit TOO scientific and a little redundant here and there. But that's a small thing. This is a damn good read. If you've got a dog that owns you, you'll enjoy dipping into this book. I recommend it.<br /><br />- Tim Bazzett, author of the memoir, BOOKLOVERrking, which intrigued me.

B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|This film made me reminiscent of the Twilight movies except without the whole vampire and werewolf thing. Full of young romantic drama. It was very nicely done.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|I liked this film because it is of the genre that I enjoy, but I personally would not by it to add to my collection. I found Hansel's diabetes thing to be a little bit unnecessary. There was a good amount of action though.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|This movie was everything I could of hoped for and more. The colors were vibrant and the acting was delightful. I loved this movie.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I think this game is fun, challenging and amusing. It challenges you to look beyond the ordinary to find the objects. I think it could have a better description of what to do, because when you first start you really don't know what to do . It gives you no directions. But I quickly understood and was off. I think this game is fun for all ages and is a great game to play to pass the time and challenge your mind too.
B002UJIY7A|5.0|Smart - well written dialogue. Non stop twists and turns. If you love crime then you will find this really is A Perfect Getaway.

B00BUADSMQ|2.0|This movie is ... fun! Just good fun. Fun for us \\"break `em, crash `em, destroy `em\\"-boys.<br />Without looking further or deeper, `cause there no breadth, nor depth, nor width ... The story is flimsy, just enough of it to fill a 25-minute TV serial... A mere pretext upon which to graft big funny explosions (the courthouse), big funny car chases (wow!: more, wilder, faster, lots of funny collateral damage and destruction...), impressive funny shootouts, but no other bodily harm than flesh wounds by bullets or debris, definitely not grievous. Not even radiation sickness after the funny final battle in Chernobyl's ransacked nuclear plant. So, it's all great fun. And welcome grandfather Willis, in great form, on whatever good-humored doping to keep him going, flanked by his son, made of the same stern material. Vulnerable but unbreakable men of steel! The stuff comics and funnies heroes are made of. Without masks or spandex.<br />Just count the number of occurrences of \\"fun\\" in the text above: that's my appreciation.<br />The best description of the flick would be: a Tex Avery cartoon, with real characters, blown out of proportion...<br />Pity, in a way, when one considers that the first installments of the franchise had a more satisfying story ...

Bonus levels are unlocked fairly quickly,  so you actually feel like you're accomplishing something. And get a load of those permissions!! Along with no IAP, this may just be as close to perfect as you can get. If only more game makers would take the hint, they may find themselves stuck with a rabidly loyal fanbase and cult following. I give it five stars and I'm stingy with stars. I'd give this one ten if I could...it really is that good.
B0024Y9EYS|3.0|Big shoes to fit. This TV series feels like was written for little kids. Vaguely resembles the actual terminator movies. Its entertaining at most.
B0085YOD1A|3.0|Looks nice, but does not offer much more than any other battery information App. I left it installed, but I don't use it.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I still can't believe how many nouns that you can actually &#34;create&#34;. I mean, how did they compose such a humongous collection of creatures, objects, and adjectives.  However they did it, they made something awesome. Really fun and looks good on large screens.  Well worth $2.99.  Fortunately its only $.99.
B00BFBBN3G|4.0|Interesting Adventure ..... Photography Excellent  .... Story line alright not the greatest.  A good movie for Family<br />Story of Life with a Tiger
1582701903|4.0|I was shopping in a used book store 56 years ago and was introduced to a book known as &#34;The New Psychology&#34; by the Author of The Master Key System by Charles F. Haanel Saint Louis Mo.1924 edition.  I read it through with skepticism at first and then found certain passages which seemed impressive to me such as positive thinking.  &#34;I am whole, perfect, strong, powerful, loving, harmonious and happy&#34;.  It had a positive effect on my attitude.  I would advise anyone to read the book and follow its subjects  even though its verbage at times becomes a little complicated.  I find the same trend of thought in &#34;The Master Key System&#34; in harmony with Charles F. Haanel.  I enjoy reading the book and at times find myself rereading certain chapters to get a clearer picture of the basic thoughts. I wish my memory was as strong as it was when I was younger to retain more of the contents of the book.  I do enjoy reading the book and feel that it puts me a step ahead of the average individual.  Thanks for the privilege of expressing my view of its contents.
B009NY43NY|3.0|A twisty plot, not uncommon for this series, but easier to follow than a couple of the previous ones. The series had to come to an end at some point and although I am certainly no writer, I don't think I would have ended it this way but I can see why the writer chose the ending she did. It makes sense & puts pieces in place & seems to be the &#34;right&#34; ending.<br />Ultimately though, i find myself saying things like &#34;But he wouldn't DO that&#34;.  I think this book ends the story in a way that leaves some of the players in Sookie's world lacking  the character & depth you've learned through the years that they actually have.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Probably the best book that I have read in years. The ending was totally unexpected. Hard to put it down once you start reading.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Although this is one of the most sad and tragic book I've ever read, I can tell you that as a mother of 2 daughters close to the age Jaycee was when abducted, I wanted nothing to do with reading this. BUT... I felt that after everything this girl was put through that the least I could do as a fellow human/woman/daughter/mother was to read her words and allow Jaycee the platform she so deserves.<br />It's not an easy book to read. The events are more than my brain could handle at times. Jaycee is honest and brave in her words. Her descriptions of situations and resulting emotions are pure & untainted as to how she experienced them at the ages she did.<br /><br />She is an amazing human with a will stronger than I could ever dream of having.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|best free game out there, progress in the game is kinda slow, but its still way awesome!!!<br />you need this game!!!!!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I like the fact that this book is written by a formerly hard science skeptic.  :)  Dr. Alexander writes witj clarity and honesty.  I literally could not put it down.  I have bought a few copies for friends as well, as gifts.  I had a &#34;dream&#34; one time, which I knew was a significant dream.  I never forgot it.  The authors account has the same authenticity and similarity to my &#34;dream.&#34;  I derived much encouragement from this book regarding what likely happens after death.  It has deepened my life as a Christian.
B001NE80P4|5.0|I bought this for my little sister and she absolutely loved it!!! The video was in great condition and I bought it from Amazon Prime and it was fabulous!!!
B00821OX98|5.0|VERY GOOD PLOT INTERESTING CHARACTERS, STORY IS GREAT FOR ALL AGES. ALL THE ACTORS ARE GREAT. ALREADY WATCHING 2ND SEASON.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Not the best hidden game, but fun nonetheless. I prefer the ones where you also search for difficult to find hidden objects in the scenery, not just in locked drawers...and the puzzles aren't exactly mind bending. My kids like this one, though, because it's not overly difficult.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|I don't pay pc games, but my son had this game on his computer and I ended up playing it until I finished twice.... very amazing, addicting, lovable characters, and challenging without being impossible. NOW, it's on my kindle fire and its got new stuff that I can't wait to get to!<br /><br />All time favorite games: River City Ransom, Castle Crashers, Kingdom Rush
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I started watching this series from day one and three seasons later I'm still hooked. Thanks go to Prime. Very saddened by the events from the last episode. My sister, my nice, my daughter and I organize a Downton Abby night every week to watch and compare how dysfunctional we all are! Ha!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My daughter and I have enjoyed this game so much. It is great<br />Game for the mind. It is fun to search for the items and clues
B006LSZECO|2.0|The IDEA of this book is creative, but the execution is wanting. The author does not sufficiently establish motives for the central characters to behave the way they do. And the ending is not quite believable either. I probably wouldn't read another Flynn book.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I HOPE THAT THERE WILL MORE AVENHER MOVIES,,,I REALLY LIFED THIS ONE VERY,VERY MUCH IRON MAN AND THE HULK THE BEST
B000WCDI5K|4.0|I love the Killers, have kept up with all of their albums. I love how this one sounds a little different from their other stuff. A little more acoustic, a little more earthy and raw. At least one song is a cover, but really well-done. I actually bought this album twice, because the first time I bought it was only digital and the file got corrupted.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|It was like having a,good long stimulating conversation with a friend, and I actually felt better for having watched it.<br />No sex, no nudity, a couple of f-bombs..but mostly just great dialogue.
B00CLZ48FA|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. The graphics were great and the story was well written. It may be a little too scary for some younger children.
B00DF0POXA|2.0|Not a big fan of auto tune... Kanye still crying...  Great deal at amazon, so I decided to see what the album was like couple catchy tracks although I recommend listening to it on you tube before buying it
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|It keeps you turning page after page. It will keep your attention all the way through the book. It is a must read
B009G78EE2|4.0|Every track is different from each other. He is passionate. You can actually hear his story through out the album
B0089XH38M|4.0|Too bad there are &#34;crazies&#34; out there who think its fun to destroy the devices of total strangers by sending viruses to unsuspecting people they don't even know, and great that there are programs like this to combat these &#34;crazies&#34; !  I love the way AVG offers an option to scan downloads before they begin, and the way that it unobtrusively monitors my tablet for infections.  I haven't had it long enough to know if it is updating its data base periodically to combat new viruses as they appear, but I certainly hope it does!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|There is nothing like belting out Rolling In the Deep as you're driving down the road!  I love this CD!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Fun, easy, beautiful! Easy for kids to do, well worth the space on my kindle. I would download this again.  My four your old plays and I organize the reef and do the challenges for him.
B003UBTX72|5.0|Very entertaining, Keith holds nothing back including sex, drugs and the creation of rock and roll ,,, all of their hits ..
B00C7NKPPS|5.0|Remastered? OK. As far as HEARING any difference between the original CD release of the album to this new 2013 version? Besides this new one being louder, there is no other difference...both versions sound the same.<br /><br />SO....let me put it this way:<br /><br />If you don't own any version of this album..BUY IT! Paul and his band really rock out on this.<br /><br />If you already have the original 2-CD Capitol/EMI release: Skip this.
0618918248|2.0|When it comes to the field of philosophy and theology, gabby Dawkins is an uneducated sophist. His wit is exceptional, his enthusiasm is spectacular, and his knowledge about the topic of God is all but... knowledgeable. Dawkins's arguments are weak and unconvincing to any college sophomore who has been educated in logic and philosophy, so much so that intellectual atheists, such as Hume or Russell, would probably be ashamed that a popular member of their ideology (or lack of ideology) would produce such a gross product of nature as Dawkins's arguments. Clearly, natural selection is not very effective among atheists of his sort and their reasoning capacity is more amusing than it is serious.
B001ZRYQSO|5.0|Leonard Cohen has aged like fine wine. His performance and his band are polished and professional and he clearly is enjoying himself on stage.
B00AUU2KI0|1.0|Bent and tattered cover, heavily marked, underlined, margin notes, highlighting, huge tape tabs and idiotic commentary.  I ordered &#34;good&#34; condition and this was a piece of trash.  How do I send it back to you, otherwise a book I intended to put into my library will go into the trash.  A disrespect to me and book-readers everywhere.  FEH!!!
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Every person living in freedom needs to read this! A chilling account of the atrocities being perpetrated by North Korea.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Sometimes when you finish a book you are left in a beautiful stunning silence. This book would be exactly that. A lengthy review is not necessary for this story. You will become enveloped in the story and characters with a wish for if to never end, much like the visitors to Le Cirque des Rêves. I'll forever consider myself a Rêveur.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|Witty and original spoof of the Omen.  Leaves other Apocalypse novels in the dust. A rollicking good read with characters that I will fondly recall for years to come.
B004UPALT6|4.0|Bruce Campbell was great in this remake of the cult hit &#34;The Evil Dead.&#34;  I actually think this version is much better with the slapstick gore effects.  I love the scene where Campbell's hand comes to life.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I like it because you can eat people you can jump and kill the birds and you can die thoes bomes
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Don't waste your time or money ! She only wrote half of the book and published it! Plus the release date kept getting pushed back, this is what we all waited for? RIDICULOUS! I would love to return it, but it's been over 7 days. Grr!
B00D56GJCE|5.0|What a delight to stumble onto such a smart show. The acting is superb by Tatiana Maslany. All the accolades to her so far are so well deserved. The storyline is so intriguing. Overall, just a good entertaining show to enjoy. Can't wait for season 2 to begin!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I downloaded this game on a whim, but I'm so glad I did because it's a great time killer! It also doesn't feel as mindless as some other games because of the application of strategy!
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|The content/story was interesting enough, but the pace of the movie put most of us to sleep.  Also. the acting seemed to be forced, not realistic.  I wish I could get my money back.
B006JPS1OM|4.0|So glad I found this. These are the type of games I love. I can't put it down. Some of the items are kind of hard to find.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I initially thought this book would be very, very depressing.  I admit that it's not a 100% work of inspiration, but it's not very depressing at all and the story is beautifully told.  Each moment, you're right there with Katniss and the other tributes.  And you can't help but have the organic feeling of wanting Katniss and Peeta to win.  This was a wonderful read.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I love these type of games. I can't wait to play the sequel. I hope you enjoy this as much as I did.
B0007ZEO4G|5.0|I recall seeing this album cover as a teen ( when it first came out) and thinking how cool it was.<br />Listening to the CD now reminds me just how great Deep Purple is.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|geart watching .could've asked for better entertainment and the extras made it ever better.i recomment jt highly ,well worth what ever you pay for it
B0028MBKVG|3.0|If you're not into running - and I mean IN TO RUNNING - then this book is not for you. This book is intended for marathoners, ultra marathoners, triathletes, or any type of workout junkie.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I've read a handful of books by this author with mixed feelings. There was undeniable poetry and imagery in his writing but it was sometimes (unnecessarily?) Byzantine. I found this simple story both vivid and approachable. Well done, Mr. Gaiman!
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved the trilogy, worth every penny. Looking forward to reading more from this author. Would love to see it as s movie, but not sure it could be anything but xxx rated, lol. Really enjoyed it though.
B00DGN51O8|5.0|I liked the movie for the story and for the graphics of everything. I really wish it was longer and had more action because it was so interesting.
B006ZB3V2C|1.0|If you're looking for a specific sound you want to mix in, you have to find the \\"background\\" image that it's associated with. This makes it difficult to choose exactly what you want. Also, because of this, you don't have access to all the sounds at once. Really limiting compared to other sleep machine apps. Kinda dissapointing.
B0088W7VNG|5.0|I enjoyed the entire Stargate collection. I was sad to see them end. They provide interesting scenarios of space travel add intrigue the mind.
B008476HBM|5.0|I don't know why it's taken me so long to read this. It's a great classic! I would recommend it to everyone!
B005H9B44A|1.0|I didn't even finish the movie.  It was dark, disjointed, and did not fulfill expectations.  Nothing like the legendary Scandinavian gods.  I expected it to be more like the recent History channel Vikjings show.
B005YPJ62E|5.0|It is very inspiring.  But it is best to play sections of it continually to keep the message in your consciousness, until it becomes habitual.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|Great movie....was a lot better than I expected it to be! The ending was a real surprise!<br />Buy it.....<br /><br />Greg/San Diego,CA
B001QC6QRC|5.0|I was so excited to see this listed. Loved this movie since I was a kid. It never gets old.
B000V8A95C|5.0|A great buy. I would recommend this for anyone looking for a show to take you on am adventure. Idina and Kristen are amazing singers.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|This is the best series I have seen on television.  Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright are superb and there is not a weak character on the show. Kate Mara nails it as an investigative reporter.  Cannot wait for the second season.  Watched the entire 13 hours in less than a week.  Very addictive and quite scary to think that this is probably closer to the real Washington than most people realize.
B00122HW92|5.0|How does one describe Royalty?  GREAT!!!<br />A must have for real rock fans.<br />Really helps productivity at work?<br />Get it now you will thankful you did!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I have read all of Khaled Hosseini novels and never failed to be moved by them.  And the Mountains Echoed didn't disappoint.  It is another terrific novel full of well developed characters and stories. I loved it and would recommend it as a top summer read for anyone looking for a great novel to lose themself in.
0307592731|4.0|What's not to love about a well written, true story vividly detailing a thing you've never done, a place you've never been, and an intimate look at the inner world of a person you've never met? It's an inspirational story, as well, of a young, wounded soul following her own unique, self designed path of healing.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|From Morgan, I really really really liked it. Yes I like it.I can't wait to read the next one. Go me!!
B007MB5OCE|5.0|It seemed a little like Forest Gump meets Lizbeth Salander.  It was original and a delightful romp.  I'd read this author again.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Its the most well known worldly book ever. There is no-one who doesn't recognize or have the abilities to grasp the truth in this book
B004M3H17Q|5.0|As I entered my suite late at night overlooking the las vegas strip i decided to grab a beer and that id check out the artist james blake who i had just recently heard of. i purchased this album and let it go and i couldnt have picked a better album to check out for that moment as it set the mood just right. i let it play and every song on the album was fantastic and it gave me a moment i will never forget. the albums great and it was my first great moment for EDC 2013. i will be checking out the rest of his work ASAP.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Fun game!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love it! Crazy crazy entertainment! Need more like it. To they make more of these? They do should
B008BIZBIY|5.0|I'm delighted to report that the extra money a Plextor drive costs is well justified.  It's exponentially faster than my old Lite-On iHAS drive and far more quiet to boot.  I'm ripping disc's at a break-neck speed and having owned a Plextor in the past, I don't expect too many coasters over it's shelf life - and this is an understatement.  Definitely satisfied.
B000EXZI14|5.0|It was  absolutely wonderful to watch them sing some of their hits! Better than Concert Quality. I really enjoyed it.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|The habit loop graphics are cute, but redundant.  The appendix attempts to break the cue~routine~reward feedback loop.  Be seeing you
B00BY8DFRW|4.0|A delightful album, full of great songs, and virtuoso playing, especially from Don Airey and Steve Morse.  Ian Paice sounds like he's got a 20-year-old's energy, and Ian Gillan hasn't sounded this good in years.
B009EP3DJM|2.0|I love Ke$ha's previous albums, but this one doesn't come close to the others.  In hindsight, I probably would not have purchased this album.
B004BEMC6G|1.0|I had seen this movie before and liked it so much I wanted to see it again and decided to stream it. When the movie started the sound was terrible. At first I thought I had blown out the speakers on my brand new tv, but after running different devices (ps3, cable tv, music) where the sound quality was perfect, and resetting the sound settings on my tv, I had come to the conclusion that the movie itself was the problem. It sounded as if the bass was turned all the way up and distorted. Each character sounded like they were talking with their hands over their mouth. Whenever I turned up the volume to make up for the muffled dialogue, an action sequence would start and would be so loud and bassy I thought it would blow out the speakers on my tv.<br /><br />If I could have returned the movie (unfortunately you cant with streaming movies), I would have. Really disappointed with the quality of the stream of the movie and might not ever order another movie from Amazon because of it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This was fun, challenging enough to satisfy a tired brain at the end of the day, but not exceptionally difficult. Looking forward to more levels!
B00BTHWFBK|3.0|Going by the first dozen listenings, I'm in the camp that says \\"13\\" seriously lacks panache, inventiveness and texture. On the other hand, the coherent droning/chugging flow of it means I'm finding it pretty great as background music for creative writing or plowing through my inbox.<br /><br />Still, after a fortnight of off-and-on consumption, there aren't any standout cuts that get stuck in my head. This might mean it's a slow-grower and in a few months (or years) it'll become a personal favourite...or not. (NB: If some pleasing subtlety does reveal itself in the fullness of time, it's unlikely to come from the lyrics, which, whenever I notice them, are more often toward the \\"insipid Ozzy\\" end of the spectrum than the \\"imaginative Sabbath\\" end.)<br /><br />Nonetheless, to my ears, Ozzy's voice and charm are in fine fettle and nice and \\"Sabbathy\\" in this outing; truly, I haven't enjoyed listening to him \\"sing\\" (caterwaul?) this much since I was 16, and the age-regression feels good. And though I long ago convinced myself \\"I love Bill Ward!\\" (and always wished they'd let him sing more than just \\"It's Alright\\"), hand on heart -- and call me naive or tin-eared -- I honestly wouldn't know it isn't him drumming.<br /><br />Another positive, for a guy who's ultra-sensitive to the lamentable \\"loudness wars\\" production trend (where they set all the levels to max, clip the dynamic range, and squeeze out all sense of spaciousness from the music), this album DOESN'T make my ears hurt after ten minutes like a lot of new \\"brickwalled\\" records do (e.g., the latest Van Halen and Rush discs).<br /><br />So, ultimately, I'm happy to have some new-old Sabbath for when I'm in the mood for it, and I thank the fellas for getting back together and making a real effort. Though I give it 3 stars, it'd be downright churlish -- and possibly outright mistaken -- to call \\"13\\" a disappointment.
B0012GMUPO|4.0|Nothing like cruising down the road listening to the metal of my youth. Solid gold and love the album. I recommend it anyone who loves classic metal.
B001NVIZ3E|5.0|A great classic action film, have watched this film/DVD many times since my childhood! Had to add to my collection
B00D2K40WY|3.0|Princess Salon is pretty fun. You get to get her hair clean and skin all prettied up! Then you do her makeup, pick her dress, and choose all of the accessories. Even though this is all fun, some of the controls are hard to do, only one of the four girls and a portion of the other accessories/makeup are unlocked, and an advertisement pops up every time you go to view the finished look. It is good fun, but has a few annoying aspects to it. If you get download this app, I wish you luck with it!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love puzzles and this game is just one big puzzle. It's not overly challenging, just good mindless fun. It moves pretty quick and it's fun to find where everything is hidden.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey is one of my favorite comedians I have followed her since Saturday night live and this book was a great addition.
B007HUD6OS|4.0|I felt this one started a little slower than the other Theodore Boone adventures, but it was so different and an enjoyable read.  Theo teaches young readers that you are never too young to make a difference.  Hopefully, it will inspire our children to stand up for what is right and get involved in local politics.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|When I purchased my Kindle the USB cable was shorted, and would not only shock me, but would not charge my Kindle. I contacted Amazon, and they kindly replaced the Amazon Kindle Fire 5ft USB to Micro-USB Cable at no cost to me, though I would have gladly paid, having gone to several large stores that sell Kindles, but were not able to help.<br />Amazon had the cord to my door in 2 days. I have no more problems, and I love my Kindle Fire.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Ever since I got the new update, all or my achievements are lost!  I will never be able to get the achievements like reach level 9, level 18, and level 40 since I was level 45 when I got the new update.  I also saved 140,000 coins and never got the achievement for saving at least 134,000 coins.  Please fix this.  Thanks!
B003ODIZL6|4.0|The New Oxford American Dictionary is a wonderful source of information about many different<br />words. By reading/studying this book one can gain an exclusive amount of information.<br /> Great for a last minute study day for Spelling or English tests or a \\" big worded \\" report<br />of some kind. I promise The New Oxford American Dictionary will come in handy for many<br /> people as it has for me.
B0053O89JM|3.0|this comment is about the condition of the product. One side of the plastic outer box was all mashed in when it was delivered to us.
B00CF34B2I|2.0|I love playing the physical card game and I was hoping to see this as something to pass the time with. It is visually appealing and easy to grasp bjt unlike other platforms srems to have no online multiplayer. This is shocking and very dissappointing, no where have I read that this was excluded from the Android version of the game. Hopefully online multiplayer is patched in the future but until then this is very disappointing. I would recommend that if you purchased this now you're fully aware that you were getting limited experience compared to other versions of the game. Buyer beware.
B0081336FO|5.0|Loved Season 2 of Sherlock.  It successfully followed up a great Season 1 and look forward to Season 3.  Love Benedict Cumberbatch!
1608871827|5.0|Pacific Rim: Man, Machines, and Monsters is a dazzling book chockfull of all sorts of neat stuff! I haven't read the whole thing yet, but what I have gives interesting insight into the making of the film. I can't wait for the film's release. I've been waiting for a movie like this for 45 years!!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I loved this book, and so did my entire book club. Very interesting, captivating characters, and lots to discuss!<br />I will read her other books!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I hate sci-fi.  So if you label a book sci-fi then I'm wary.  What I DON'T like about sci-fi is magical creatures; things that are too unrealistic.<br /><br />What's great about this series is it's REAL people acting as if you and I would were we in this situation in the future.<br /><br />You're just dying inside hoping the main characters succeed.  And nothing comes easily.<br /><br />Cool idea.  Cool book.  Hard to put down. (Thanks for the lack of sleep, Hugh!!)
B008PZ69T8|5.0|I enjoy being in my art studio working listening to this music, it is more religious sounding but that is fine.  I really like the piano ones more then the opera ones.
B00CXL6XP0|4.0|This is an amazing album. I've been a 'ryche fan since the EP. In fact I purchased the EP as an album (big round black thing with grooves) back when I was in high school, that's how frigging old I am. Anyway this is the album that the boys have been itching to put out for years since, or at least it seems that way. This is simply unabashed Queensryche at it's fullest. The new singer fits right in. If you get a chance check out some live videos of him singing Queen of the Ryche.<br /><br />The songs are really catchy and the riffs are just classic. The ONE thing that annoys me to no end about this album is the production. For the most part it sounds great but whoever mastered this thing should know better. At every turn there is static that really detracts from the quality of the album. It's not Kelly Grey producing Nevermore's Enemies of Reality bad but it certainly leaves a lot to be desired.<br /><br />I listen to music on headphones and I get this effect on both my Sennheiser HD-700's and my custom 1964-Ears in ear monitors.<br /><br />Get this album.
B00AA0RZZI|5.0|Enjoyed this less graphic sexual description but pulled into the relationship and evolution of Ana and Christian main characters I would be looking for more of her work on this storyline for sure.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|If you have read all the books, you have to keep going. I could not put it down!! Way to keep the story going. Can't wait for the next one.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|Christian Bale is always  an actor that is able to bring everything to a character he protrays..  The other actors are good too but BAle is truly outstanding.  Ordered the others to add to this one.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|The first and still best TCG (by an enormous margin) finally on kindle? Awesome. Duels 2014 does not disappoint. Good luck getting anything else done for a week.
0792160347|5.0|Richard Gere is so talented never feel to deliver , even though this is now decades old the music and the story is still very good I never tire from watching it. HAve most of his movies.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A fun game that is easy to use and great for horse lovers. I love this game it is very entertaining.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|There was a lot of reasons I didn't want to watch this movie. Here is what I thought the whole plot was, doctor gives crazy gal drugs, crazy girl starts acting a little crazier as she blacks out, and then she starts sleeping with manipulative doctor.<br />So, when I was asked to sit and watch this movie I was in no way excited to see something as boring as that, I was also curious if a drug company would let their name be used and shown in a negative light without suing the pants and or cargo shorts off from somebody for this movie.<br />And then about 20 minutes in, movie was nothing like I thought it'd be. The trailer is a huge catastrophe for the proper selling of this movie. It's got twist and turns and many moments that have you asking the person next to you if they think it's so and so's fault or someone else's.<br />No car chases. None of that, but a nice twist and turn's movie that you may be missing out on.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I bought the season one CDs and was hooked immediately.  I've now watched all three seasons and can't wait for the next season to start.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Pretty Fun. My horse is healthy and i lov how i can take care of him everyday. This is a really cool game.
B008JFUUIA|3.0|Well, well, I can see by the thousands of reviews here that PITCH PERFECT has struck a chord.  (I know, bad pun, plus at the rate reviews are posting this one will rapidly disappear from the first page.)  I ran across this light snack the other night on cable, so I tossed the remote across the room and watched this silly, somewhat contrived flick about a ditzy all girls a cappella group compete for the collegiate national singing title.  And their major rival is an all boys group on the same campus.  How gauche!  The girls group is in a rut; their act has grown boring and stale, yet headstrong leader Aubrey (Anna Camp) refuses to take on new material, forcing a girl power revolt, led by talented Beca (Anna Kendrick), and The Barden Bellas get their act together just in time for their climactic performance that brings down the house.  Meanwhile, there's an on-again, off-again romance between Beca and Jesse (Skylar Astin), a member of the rival boy band, that's so predictable you can set your watch to it.<br /><br />Outside of Kendrick (along with John Michael Higgins and the stunning Elizabeth Banks, who play the announcers at the various a cappella contests), the cast of PITCH PERFECT is unknown to me, yet for the most part turns in enough energy to keep this light offering fresh.  And no complaints whatsoever with all the gorgeous Barden Bellas eye candy; scrumptious.  As an extra bonus, the cast can flat out sing, and many of the cover songs you'll recognize and enjoy as the various groups strut their stuff.  (There's even a song performed from the movie [[ASIN:B001AEF6BI The Breakfast Club]], for goodness sake.)  Some of the humor is sophomoric and lame, some of it works, but overall if you're looking for fluff to entertain you for 90 minutes, you can't go wrong with PITCH PERFECT.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.
B0017VG69U|5.0|As a fan for my entire life, It was nice to see the original series with updated special effects. I was also very pleased that they resisted the temptation to &#34;touch up&#34; other aspects of the show; Such as updating the aliens. Aspects that, in my opinion would have ruined it. The original stories are still there, as well as the character interaction that made this show so popular.
B0085TKAW6|4.0|Really enjoyed reading this book. A bit heavy going as the subject matter is world war two and all the atrocities that went with it. Ken Follett is a brilliant writer and explains what happened and why in an easy to understand way. I had a great history lesson and can't wait for the third book to be released.
B00C4PLRE2|4.0|\\"Mountain Justice\\" was everything I expected:  well-written in an easy style, a complex plot, and it conveyed several emotions.  Best of all, I read this story during my lunch break; it was an adventurous \\"get-away.\\"<br /><br />I was given the opportunity to receive a free copy of this story by Karen Black, the author; my fast fingers led me to accidently purchasing it instead; I wasn't disappointed in the end.<br /><br />I won't spoil the plot ending for potential readers here; rather, I'll share the emotions \\"Mountain Justice\\" conveyed to me instead.<br /><br />George really angered me.  I wanted to run far, far away from him; none of his actions were admirable.  I was angry at his actions right up to the end, yet happy at meeting his Karma.  Rob I liked.  He is affable, strong, and comfortable with his masculinity and emotions.  Rob left me glad at his taking control of the situation, but disappointed at how he arrived at it.  Annie left me wanting to know her more.  She is complex, strong, yet reliant on Rob.  I believe Annie herself became an even stronger woman at the end of the story because of Rob.<br /><br />And yet, who is the hero of this story?  It will surprise you, and I will leave you, the reader, to find out and cheer!<br /><br />I thank the author, Karen Black, for giving me the opportunity to read \\"Mountain Justice,\\" and I will definately be reading her other works, too!<br />#  #  #  #  #<br />FOLLOW my blog at http://sugarbeechronicles.com<br />FOLLOW on Twitter @SugarBeeDiaries
0345529057|5.0|These books are great. I am into the 3rd book right now and the condition of these books are still great. The binding holds really well and there are no pages falling out. This is a great value for 4 great books. I only wished that the 5th book had a trade paperback out so that it was included in the box set. So I had to buy the 5th book in hardcover and it looks a little weird on my book shelf. But if anyone loves the show or wants a new series to read then these books are right for you. The only thing to keep in mind while reading these books is that they are very long and really character driven. So enjoy the great works of George R.R. Martin.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I liked this book, although I do not consider it a &#34;happy&#34; book.  The subject matter is interesting and thought provoking.  It is very well written in a somewhat unusual format.  The story &#34;stays with you&#34;....even after finishing it.
B009UHHELM|5.0|I love this story. I kinda felt sorry for all of the characters in this series. I had to see if it all worked out in the end. Benedict Cumberbatch was brilliant! Well done!
B000FA675C|4.0|But, it is a clever and intriguing yarn. Don't let it shake your faith. All in all, very entertaining. Recommended!
B004132I20|5.0|I would recommend this series to anyone! It's the kind of show you can watch over and over, and still enjoy it. The acting is perfect. The script awesome. I can't wait to see Season Three!!! Did you know that the stars in this show (Martin Freeman/Benedict Cumberbatch) also star in &#34;The Hobbit&#34;? Martin is Bilbo and Benedict is Smaug. =)
B001JU4S44|3.0|This was a good movie but too many impossible things.  Makes it more fake that way.  Needs to be a little more realistic.
080701429X|4.0|A brief but meaningful insight into the heart and mind of a man who survived the holocaust without bitterness or fears. An important book to prepare us for what may be difficult days ahead. It's all in the attitude of heart to rise above evil and hold to a higher purpose than hate or fear.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|After watching seasons 1and 2 on Amazon Prime there was no hesitation about purchasing season 3. Best television drama by a mile.... Will be hoping the whole season watch that it doesn't end!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|After a began the first installment I was hooked by the story line, even though it was almost similar to a famous erotic novel 50 times better. Since it was always a trilogy I said great the characters are going to develop through the stories of the three books. I was shocked and felt robbed when I finished the book. There is no conclusion, it's just a backdrop for a continuation of a series that I honestly thought it was going to end with this book. Ms. Day shame on you, for taking advantage of your readers that have been faithful to you and the crossfire trilogy, not the series as you have just recently named it. When you promise something you deliver, I would have preferred if you had waited more and had a book with the plots that are intended for the fourth and fifth installments. The readers would have felt more satisfied. Right now I don't give a damn what will happen to brent, corinne, cary or any of the other characters, I am satisfied knowing that Gideon and Eva are married and one way or another they will work their issues in time. Thank you Ms. Day for proving the sad truth that money is more important.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Did not think all the hype could be true..Watched one episode to take a look see and have been hooked ever since. Love the quality of this series....the sets, location, and incredible casting all make it an award worthy watch.
B003MC5N28|4.0|This book really got me thinking about our society and the way people behave towards one another.  We need to celebrate our uniqueness.
B002Y0TGOU|4.0|Enjoyable restart of the Star Trek fantasy, JJ Abrams does a brilliant job casting the original crew of the Enterprise.  The premise is genius as it allows the story to be developed differently than the original series and it's spin-offs.  Chris Pine is excellent as a young Jim Kirk, even mimicking Willam Shatner's swagger and speech patterns.  Lots of twists and turns, hang on to your seat, the latest series is sure to bring excitement and adventure to us die hard trekkies.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />It always keeps me wanting more.<br />I will even watch it over & over & over again.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A fun game to play to kill some time.  Wish there were more levels because you can play the game quickly.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I love my kindle and wanted to gift a book to my husband, who has a Samsung tablet. We did have to call for technical support but eventually he was able to read the book--the graphics were way better than my original reader. I'm glad this interface exists.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I dislike how Nathan was tricked and treated.<br /><br />I did not like Max lying.  I wanted him to reconnect with his son.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Just challenging enough. I really really liked this game and I will wait for more levels. Down load it,  it's worth it!
B00BTHV05M|5.0|I have been in love with this song ever since the first time I heard a preview! OneRepublic Rocks!! &#60;3&#60;3&#60;3
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book was amazing! I highly recommend it to anyone that is interested in our military and the lives of soldiers.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I have been in love with this song ever since the first time I heard a preview! Fun Rocks!! &#60;3&#60;3&#60;3
B005ES0YEK|5.0|I usually wear a 7 1/2 wide, and I ordered the 5M / 7W and they fit perfectly.  They must run a little big / wide, as other reviewers have stated.  I love them!  The traction is wonderful, and they are so comfortable!
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|Lots of proven advice for starting your own tech business. All of it may not apply and/or be possible for your situation, but you can def. take away some useful knowledge.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I am generally not a hidden object fan, but after taking a look at the reviews, I figured to give it a try and wasn't disappointed. You don't just mindlessly look for random objects stuck randomly in the scene for little to know reason, but instead, actively seek out items that you use in a multi-level quest to get out of the various rooms. It is much closer to a detective story.
B0098QBEXO|5.0|I'm certainly am no movie critic. The reason I watched this one was to survey the acting history of the Benedict Cumberbatch, an actor I've recently have been impressed by. I wasn't sure what I was getting into when I started watching this movie and ended up very surprised and pleased. Although the underlying circumstances that brought the characters together is a somber one, there was a happy overlay of great friendship, close ties and unbreakable bonds. All of the actors were great and I really enjoyed dynamic relationships between the characters. I found myself crying like a baby at the end. Although sad, there is a beauty to this movie that makes it worth watching.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Im happy with it. I haven't tried doing any hardcore sharpening with it yet, but its got the three sharpeners, and it's small enough that it will fit comfortably in your change pocket. I love that it can sharpen serrations too. Great for an EDC bag. For a Bug  out Bag i'd reccomend the Lanksy Puck, though.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I would definitely recommend this movie.  Great story, great actors and acting.  It's a great mix of intensity, humor, and action.
B00CL68BK2|3.0|Slow starting movie, takes a long time to develop plot.....very uncomfortable subject and huge tension between son and<br />parents. However once it gets going it is terrific story line and conclusion is very heart warming and uplifting....however you<br />have to stick with the early part of the film. I almost quit watching.
B001NLKXK2|4.0|Still Alice puts the reader in the Alzheimer's victim's shoes and gives some insight into the disease process.  I think it makes one more empathetic.
B00BOL126U|5.0|Yes, it's brutal. Yes, it's violent. BUT, it's realistic. The Vikings are my ancestors. They are the ancestors of more people than you can imagine. I can trace my line back to the year 600 and yes, Ragnar IS my ancestor. Although they were brutal and vicious, you have to admit, they were a mighty race of people. They loved their Gods and their families. They fought hard, and long to get what they wanted. Cruel? Yes, definitely. At times. But gentle with their children and wanting only the best, and strongest for their \\"tribes\\". Love them, hate them, they have earned a place in history that will never be forgotten. This series does them justice without pandering to the masses who want to show them as \\"hippies\\".
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Other than this product being shipped to another address, I LOVE it.  I sent my grandson a birthday gift and changed back to my old address but evidently either I or the system did something wrong.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|This is a great movie for a lot of reasons, not the least of which is Joss Whedon at the helm. RDJ makes a hilarious Tony Stark, but you know this. The surprise for me was the Hulk - this was the best I've ever seen him done. Ruffalo is a great Banner, believably on the verge of losing it any minute. &#34;The Other Guy&#34; was visceral and just flat out awesome.
B005544TRQ|5.0|You ever have family or friends that hype up something so much that it leaves you disappointed? Yeah, that didn't happen here. After month of being told I had to watch it, I finally caved. I'm really glad I did.
B005S9ELY4|4.0|I haven't seen many lately, and this one does the trick.  Without giving away the movie, it has elements of Goodfellas and Dick Tracy.  It may not sound like it works, but it does.  It makes for an enjoyable movie with good action and good acting.  Highly recommended.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I love reading this point of view. Her story on how she fell in love with a man and his lifestyle. The mystery behind his childhood and what the future could be like. Can not wait to read book 2!
B00A81NFAS|5.0|Quirky might be an understatement, but it is well worth watching. The acting is amazing with both Cooper and Lawrence giving great performances.  The story keeps you entertained and hoping for the best.  Great movie, well worth checking out.
B00CHI5B7A|3.0|Not my favorite by any means, but the actors kept me entertained and somewhat into it.  Pretty predictable and there was really no struggle or &#34;how are they going to get this guy&#34; feeling.  The movie just kind of happens in front of you, then the credits roll.
B006MW3V6U|3.0|The extra video kind if gives a recap of what's been shown and a peek into the actors' and director's interpretation of the characters.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I Love the app  it good great it just takes you away  I mean it what else can you  say
6304936362|5.0|One of my all time favs/I can still put it on and watch it and cry and laugh and be a proud American
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|In this season Dexter gets too close to getting caught.  It was enthralling to watch him squeak out of trouble, but too close for comfort.  Something has to give, and, I imagine Season 8 will do it.
0141345659|5.0|Love everything about it! It takes me back to young love and finding a new love, I am not finished--but I really don't want it to end!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's nice and simple, although I wish there were more than just ten levels because you can whip through them so fast.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Loved it ! Each word had me lingering and wanting more. Descriptive without being raunchy!  Good read! Read it for yourself. You will love it too!
B00B1R8TCM|5.0|This is a brilliant album in soo many ways! whether your a die-hard Ben Harper fan or you've never heard of him. I recommend this album! Ben & Charlie have a musical chemistry that is very hard to match. I can't decide which is my favorite song, literally! I'm looking forward to some more tunes in the future from this duo, for sure! FIVE STARS ALL THE WAY!!!
B000JML7EC|4.0|I am a road warrior, both for business and for pleasure, and I like being able to carry my reading material on a tablet/phone rather than lugging paperbacks or hardbacks around. This e-book looks very good on all my mobile devices.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Another great book by Colleen Hoover!  I love the story and the twist at the end.  Can't wait to read the sequel!
B000JQU1VS|4.0|I am a road warrior, both for business and for pleasure, and I like being able to carry my reading material on a tablet/phone rather than lugging paperbacks or hardbacks around. This e-book looks very good on all my mobile devices.
B0073COMUW|4.0|Well, it's BRIGHT! Really. Not soft enough for indoor use, so I put it outside. Now if it lasts as long as billed, it's a 5-star product. But I don't know that yet, so 4-stars will have to do.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I'm a weather fanatic and this tells me everything I need to know quickly and accurately. much better than some other weather apps I've tried.
B000GWE44U|5.0|Hard to believe but this is the first time I have seen this movie.  Where have I been all my life???  My granddaughter recommended it and she was spot on.  A very good movie.
1849904251|5.0|This book is simply a must have if you are a fellow sherlockian! Plus the shipping is not bad. I ordered this book in July 13. It shipped three business days later and then arrived today which is six business days from the ship date. I am very happy because it only took about 9 days for this wonderful book to come to my house! I will recommend this book to every fan!
B0085YOD1A|3.0|This app works fine but has to be started when I want to check my remaining battery strength. The phone's built in battery meter while not as graphic is available without doing anything but looking at the screen.
B00821OX98|5.0|A most see gripping suspenseful and an emotional factor that captures your eye great show recommend to all great effects and story line
B009ZQ8FQG|1.0|The show is great but the quality of transmission is poor. HULU does a much better job. I will not be continuing &#34;Prime.&#34;
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really Love it!!!!!........ I am playing all the time... :) and will be continue to play.... well, I'll give you 10 stars forit..
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I Like how simple it is to use. My only complaint would be that some of the selections are lower volume than others, which causes me to adjust the volume on two separate volume controllers.
B00992CF6W|1.0|After a long time searching for the minecraft game, and downloading 2 other books for $7(tips and cheats, & the ultimate) I thought  I finally found this dumb game. after another $7, it shows up as another book!!! As far as I'm concerned minecraft on Amazon is a Scam!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Unusual style, very worm...makes you feel good while reading...a book about good things in human race and about misterious ways of destiny..
B002BAOE90|5.0|This is fantastic. This product comes with 3 cds 1 data disk cd 16 page booklet and 2 record set vinyl.  disc 1 13 tracks disc 2 high resolution cd  plus 3 dvd videos disc 3 8 tracks instrumental takes off the album that are really good its like another fireman release in it self.If you liked the album alot then you will love this .I do.Yes its pricy but worth every penny.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|some difficultly connecting to Internet but otherwise fun game for all ages.  great game for kids and adults alike. love it
B0078X2LKY|5.0|My kindle fire isn't reading it aloud is there a setting or something I need to adjust please let me know
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game , the only thing was, once I got going I was done with all ten levels.  Left me wanting to do more levels.
B00BMR5HOO|5.0|This is a great weather app.  It is very easy to use and very detailed.  Highly recommend.  Great to have right at your fingertips.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome but addicting app i love taking care of somthing on my kindle that i cant have in real life love it
B008476HBM|5.0|My favourite of all Jane Austin's books. Which astute reader (particularly of the female variety) wouldn't appreciate this timeless classic?
0062127241|3.0|I will forever love Pete Townshend and his awesome body of work. Consequently, I was looking forward to his autobiography.Unfortunately, I found it very superficial, as though I was reading his story written by a reporter in the New York Times. He tells his story from a distance and reveals very little. I know more about Pete from his songs than I do from this book. Sorry, Pete, but this book was easy to put down and not so easy to pick up again. But, I finally plowed through to the end.
1400079276|5.0|MURAKAMI IS A MIND-EXPANDING AUTHOR. WHEN I TOOK THIS OFF THE SHELF AND STARTED TO READ, I WAS TRANSPORTED TO A TENSE, AND WONDERFUL WORLD. IT IS NO WONDER MURAKAMI IS SO FAMOUS
B004DF3S7A|3.0|I don't know. I didn't like his rendition of 'I'll Be Seeing You.' Otherwise it's acceptable enough as it is.
B00CM9JKQM|1.0|If you ever deep down inside wondered what would happen if Alvin, Simon and Theodore got together with the guys not named Geoff Tate and recorded bland, pedestrian sorta metal-ish sounds, this is the album for you! Congratulations to the Queensremnants guys for being so dull and uninspired they couldn't come up with anything more creative than using the name of their first EP (again)...then again, considering the length, this isn't much more than an EP. If you have to buy a self-titled disc from Queensryche, make it the first EP and not this sad thing.
B000002NAK|5.0|Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber, while changing the songs here and there, and adding that TERRIFIC one at the end, clearly exhibits his genius yet again! I'm not a fan of Madonna but, she is a talent for sure! As is Antonio Banderas! And Jonathan Pryce. Indeed, this is a replacement for my other one 'cause I played it so much it was too scratched to use anymore!!!!!!!!!!!
B0085RQLXK|2.0|A very long and dull album that features few to no highlights and sounds tired, almost like the guys needed to take a nap break in the middle of nearly all the songs. There is no reason for this disc to exist.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|There's basically no semblance to the movie... or rather, the book and movie don't seem to be related. I know, I know, but buying the book and reading before I saw the movie made me wish that there would be characters whom I read about before that helped flesh out the characters in the movie. After watching the movie, I wanted him to be like Brad Pitt from the movie. Still a good book, and also great movie.
B008G8SFGO|2.0|This was the most unnecessary rock album released in 2012 and maybe ever. Not even a Modern Day Delilah to save this one.
B00BESM14U|5.0|The movie is much more than a high school angst movie.  There are many sub plots, twists and turns.<br />You feel for the characters.<br />Even when I thought the movie was going to end - there were more twists.<br />Highly recommended if you like movies which have underdogs fighting to move forward.
B0041CRBZK|5.0|Every episode with Charlie Harper in it is worth paying for. Seasons 1-8 are still the best. Everybody, from Evelyn down to little Jake, was belly-laugh great.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Last night after giving up, it 'healed' and this morning all of my books we there!  Love Kindle<br /><br />Original Review:<br /><br />not happy loaded Kindle app to new phone, and unable to access library exists on the Amazon website under my name but I am on able to get it to appear on my phone. Follow directions and tell it to download the book I want to read and it does not appear. Nuts!<br />Kindle app is great when it works love it.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|Loved the scenery. Loved the story.  Loved the actors.<br />Beautifully done.  The real story is amazing. Love conquers all every time.
B004P8A7J2|5.0|Always wanted to see this one and it was worth the wait. You won't forget it. Another Darren Aronofsky masterpiece. Beautiful Soundtrack as well.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|It is a fun little game. It passes a few moments quickly and is fairly fun. There's not a whole lot of thought that goes into it, but you do have to keep track of everything. I wish you could earn coins faster in the Classic mode, but that's my one complaint.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is fun and challenging but it also gets me frustrated! Even so, it can become very addicting and take up some free time
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game but it is hard sometimes but very fun and it keeps you on your toes and keeps your mind working.
0375869026|5.0|Wow! As a person in my early twenties and fifth grade teacher, this book lends itself to so many valuable lessons on the importance of perspective, empathy and genuine kindness for adults and children of all backgrounds. The differing points-of-view give the reader an opportunity to connect with all characters and to justify their otherwise questionable actions and relationships with each other throughout the story. Auggie is a true representation of what it means to have \\"good character\\" and reminds us not to take ourselves too seriously, something I emphasize regularly with my students. I MUST find a way to incorporate this book into my classroom next year to provide my fifth graders with the insight that they often lack when they find themselves in a battle between what is popular and what is right. This book is, without a doubt, the best book that I have experienced in a long time. I give it a STANDING OVATION!
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|This was a great twist on the older movie and an awesomely close match to the comics. No short of gore and violence, oddly enough it had a decent story line and it was done real well. You could tell this movie was mad for 3d but even watching it in 2d it was still really well edited. All around after assuming this movie would be SUPER cheesy like the older one, it really wasn't all that cheesy. If you have some time and nothing to watch I would definitely rent this and watch it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Theres soooo much to do on this app. It is really fun! I bought the 3d virtual Horse for $1.99 And that wasnt very fun but, I got this one for free and it was much much much better!!!!!! I reccoment this app.
1932100660|4.0|As a person who cares about health and the environment, this book confirms everything I know about diet and nutrition. It's one of those things that I'd want all my friends and family to sit down and really take a good look at. It's certainly not a run of the mill paperback. The book is well written and backed up with undeniable facts and wisdom.
B00COGZ8FU|1.0|This movie was a waste of time.  Tom Cruise is just awkward in it.  The supposed sexual chemistry between him and his leading lady is laughable.  Don't bother watching.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|AWESOME I LOVE IT I LOVED THE GAME AND WAS SAD WHEN I BEAT IT BECAUSE IT WAS OVER! IM SO HAPPY NOW THANK YOU S MUCH!!!  :)
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Watched the entire series in 2 days! Tatiana Maslany is amazing! Jordan Gavaris (Felix) is perfect and adds just a touch of levity in what is a great dramatic series. Loved it and can't wait for Season 2!
B0062QRTKA|2.0|Well was interested in this because it was apparently rated #1  &quot;Action Game&quot; with some sort of group I had never heard of.  I'm not one for games linked directly to any religion so this isn't that great for me.  I like the concept and if it wasn't so obvious I wouldn't mind.  Luckily it was free app of the day and I didn't waste money on it.
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|Wonderful book series! I would read in through again. Would also love to see more movies made of the other books.
B001OSIV62|5.0|Highly recommend this documentary. It's absolutely amazing. Great story. What this guy did was just brilliant. Wish there was another documentary that talked about his other amazing walks
B0027MJU00|5.0|Loved it!!! The author sucks u in and has you until the last page. I will read anything she writes.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|If you like mahjong get this app wish it was a little bigger but for free it's okay.  Enjoy and can play for quite awhile with all the different levels
B000IZAHB4|5.0|When it comes to the ultimate state of helplessness, both the victims and witnesses experience, their worst nightmares, wide awake all hope is lost when the bogie man is in season he has 23 days to feed an no one can stop him. very scar.y
B0007O38XU|5.0|Mel Brooks is one of the world's funniest writer's.  When he appears in the movies it's even better.  This spoof is hillarious.
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|we really enjoy this movie.  My children watched it when they were younger and now that my daughter is a teenager she wanted to watch it.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|It was a really interesting book that just kept me reading and interested and it had a lot of twist in it.
B00133KHCY|5.0|I can't say anything about this one as far as the quality of the blu-ray. But the movie itself is one of my favorites and will finally be able to enjoy it when ever I feel like it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love solitaire. and find this version to be one of the best I've played on any platform.  Athens controls are intuitive. and game play is smooth.  I highly recommend it.
B0036EH3TS|5.0|I haven't watched this on the blu-ray yet. But am excited to, for the enhanced visual effects. Can't wait to watch!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Great book!!  Full of action.  Can't wait to read &#34;A Clash of Swords&#34;.  I would recomend this book to anyone who likes a good read.  I did not want to put the book down.
B004IALZUW|3.0|Really epitomizes the early 90s, came out around the same time as the Micheal Keaton Batman movie. It's about as good as a Dick Tracy movie can be, I suppose. Best part of the movie is Al Pacino as Big Boy.
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|I ordered because I love this movie.  It arrived promptly and has been a wonderful addition to my movie library.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I am not much of a reader anymore. Sadly, I work too much and only have time for the occasional business journal or quick political read. I chose 11/22/63 as my fun book for a vacation and couldn't put it down. It's the first fun book I have actually finished, cover to cover, in years. It was a blast going back in time and reliving a by gone era. Great book!!
B008602KQI|5.0|simply outstanding, the acting is super. In order to really enjoy the movie, I would recommend that you definitely read the novel first
B00000J2PH|5.0|I originally purchased this in the 60's when it was on vinyl.  My first marriage was breaking up and this album really helped me through some difficult times.  I have gone from a &#34;hippie&#34; to a retiree and still love this music, every song is a winner and I am now the proud owner of my all time favorite album on a CD.  I guess that is progress!
B009VSW15Y|3.0|The app itself seems to work fine once you stumble through the functions, which are not explained. The biggest problem is that the Kindle only takes pictures in one direction, having no forward facing lens, which severely limits the use of a camera app of ay kind.
B0002C4JE4|5.0|Love every song on this CD, except have to make sure to turn it off when it gets to Steamroller Blues if any grandkids are around.<br /><br />James Taylor is a poet and his music is inspirational.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|A horrible experience told so honestly.  It is disturbing and inspirational. It had to take a lot of courage to survive and relive while writing the book.
0061122416|3.0|Santiago is a shepherd boy who travels from Spain to the Egyptian pyramids for treasures.  Along the way he meets spiritual types of people who have messages and lessons for him.  The novel reminded me of Joseph Campbell's Hero books.  But honestly, this book seems new-agey and therefore it's not up my alley.  Also, I didn't really get into the plot of the book until I was halfway through.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was both fun yet really challenging at times. Great at any time. it was hard but if you are a good thinker you will get it
B006LR0XLM|5.0|I love Dropbox.  It is fast and so easy to share files. I can collaborate with colleagues with minimum effort.
B001K3EXTA|5.0|This movie was both classic and unpredictable.  Very unique!  Robert Redfor and Mia Farrow did a great job and their characters were extremely believable.  The twist and turns this movie took is indicative of well written script.  I loved it and would recommend it to anyone.  Note:  True story - On Thanksgiving 2011, I went to a friends home for dinner and was pissed on by a young Jack Terrier (dog) because he was so excited to see me.  I was shocked of course, but a few months later he was hit by a car and died.  POOR GATSBY!
B00C3V5TTQ|4.0|I've always liked art that has a little darkness under a pleasing surface. OMD does that pretty well. When Dazzle Ships came out it became one of my favorites for  late night listening. There is a lot of that album in English Electric. It's thought provoking. Has me again contemplating technology, techno-worship, consumerism, and social organization. Probably too dry for shiny happy people, but i appreciate the intellectual edge it provides.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|really fun app. Very challenging. Eagerly awaiting more levels. Unlike most games like this, this one keeps you guessing from level to level.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|It is either this season or the third that is the best, imo.  I keep going back and forth as to which one I like more.
B009X010RU|5.0|This microshell standing folio case is perfect for me.<br />I didn't want something big and clunky, but wanted<br />the protection for my kindle.  It does it's job perfectly!<br />Slim enough to slide in a purse and strong enough<br />to recover from a drop...If that's what you're looking<br />for, this case is perfect for you!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is great! I hope to see new levels or game connections in the near future. It's kinds like a good book it's hard to put down. Great job.
B00D3V5V7U|5.0|Being an &#34;older&#34; fan of Black Sabbath, I have to admit this is one of the best albums I have ever purchased! They held true to their old style, the deep foreboding tones, the fantastic rifts from Tony, all amount to (in my opinion)  one of Black Sabbath's best music ever. I can't stop listening to it! This album is amazing, for any true Sabbath fan, this is a definite &#34;must have&#34; album, and considering their collective ages, this may be the last great album they put out. All I can say in this generations vernacular,  OMFG! What an album.
B003KK65KG|5.0|Heartbreaking and thought provoking read - one of Picoult's best.  As always I loved exploring the theme from the different character's perspectives.
B008A31UO4|1.0|I had high hopes for this book based on the reviews, but there are multiple typos that have left me scratching my head. Normally typos may not be that big a deal in a fictional book, but when you have to spend time guessing what the authors meant in a technical book, it shows a complete breakdown in the editing of this Kindle version.  I highly recommend that you don't waste your money on this book, at least until they get a competent editor and fix the multitude of mistakes.
159463176X|5.0|Great book . Loved all his  other books. Great reading. Highly recommend it you never want it to end and it keeps you enthralled
B008LA7RMK|4.0|As has been identified in previous reviews, it should be a minor revelation to fans of The Beach Boys to finally hear the Today! album in stereo. I believe that an ambitious production such as this album truly benefits from having a second channel to work with. One can understand why Brian would have originally wanted the album to be released only in mono. By having more control over the listening experience in mono, Brian was following production methods utilized by his idol, Phil Spector, mirroring his attitude towards his greatest Wall of Sound productions, that they should be heard in mono only.<br />All that being said, the dense nature of the recordings of Today! fueled by Brian's constantly expanding creativity and consequently advanced arrangements, can be given room to breathe and be heard with more distinction and clarity in a stereo field.<br />There are a few gripes here about equalization, channel balance as well as concerns with Dennis' lead vocal on In The Back Of My Mind. Overall, these are minor quibbles if you consider the possible problems that could have existed with the original tapes and that's if they were available at the time of transfer for this release. It's also possible that not all the tapes were in the same condition or retained a high fidelity due to storage or temperature problems. If you recall, In The Back Of My Mind sounds quite good if you compare it to the previously available North American mono version on CD. The two-fer that I have has bad distortion on the vocal near the end of the song. I don't know if that was due to a bad transfer or inferior tapes being used but there is none of that on the stereo mix of that song. I haven't listed to the mono mixes on the new CD yet but the stereo mixes really bring the sound quality up near the quality of the songs and arrangements.<br />My only real gripe about this release is the shoddy packaging which includes a very thin cardboard sleeve with one slot with a 2 page insert with basic recording and release information and another slot where the disc is lodged. I say lodged because there is no sleeve or insert protecting the disc! Like too many mini-LP style packages today, the disc is just put in a cardboard slot. They should have included a small disc sleeve or something. It's cool that both the mono and stereo mixes are here but perhaps EMI should have done stereo two-fers with 2 albums like before but just new mixes. They could also have done mono two-fers for purists.<br />Overall, I have to recommend this release for Beach Boys fans even if the packaging is sub-par. The music doesn't lie!c recording and release information and another slot where the disc is lodged. I say lodged because there is no sleeve or insert protecting the disc!

B00D2K40WY|3.0|its cool but if you don't pay you don't get a lot of options and its not as fun as if you payed.
B007TMON8M|3.0|great and fun game, but crashes when switched to pressure view which is a problem when trying to find where the weak spot is in the structure
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|This is easily the best new show on TV, and one of the best period. Don't binge on it, but do watch. It's worth it.
159463176X|3.0|I felt the story jumped around too much.<br />I enjoyed his descriptions of the people. This was not as good as Hosseini's two previous novels.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great read.  Loved the characters, pace of the story, plot line, and writing style.  I highly suggest this book, especially if you love dystopic or sci-fi.
B0084AXZK0|3.0|This story was very slow to get into. I think it was a bit too long. The first part of the story was getting a little too uncomfortable to read that I didn't read it for a while.
B0031TZBCO|5.0|This short book is extremely eloquent. The conversational style kept me hooked throughout, and I was moved by the deep and profound insights  that unfolded. An important book for these times
B006XF5BTG|5.0|An informative book about building lean muscle and the quest for achieving the \\"shredded\\" body. A quick read and a great reference guide to supplements and the \\"do's and don'ts\\" at the gym.  M. Matthews breaks things down into simple explanations about getting leaner or gaining mass. I would recommend this to others.
B002VHI8FE|5.0|What an unexpected treasure. This is on par if not better than Game of Thrones. LOVE this authors writing style. The characters and story are compelling and rich. A fun fun ride.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|Compared to Child's previous Reacher novel, and I've read all of them, Wanted Man is a disappointment.  Without giving away the plot, I felt the story was tedious, and more implausible than I can tolerate.  It felt like I was reading something that was rushed into print just to capture the $$$ that Lee Child commands with his books.  Felt a little like reading recent Clancy novels compared to Clancy's first few novels.
B00D6BU8GG|1.0|This film lacked some of the feel as well as sincere moments from the first three films.  I hated it.
B000MD9UJC|5.0|My flashlights sit in the cars and are frequently dim when I need them even with relatively new batteries.  The LED light is much more tolerant of tose conditions.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The flows are like neon. Challenging puzzles. And easy ones for kids too. All I can say is: GET THIS GAME!!!!!!
B00B6CUO6Q|5.0|Absolutely wonderful series!  Best ever!  Can't wait for Season 4!<br />Maggie Smith is a jewel...<br />Quality entertainment!  A must have!
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I got this game on my kindle fire and there are no bad ads on it. And I had this game since February 2013. So I'm just scratching my right now wondering about the other reviews.
0316154687|5.0|I have most of his in audible instead of print.... easy for travel or relaxing outside...... I thought I would regret not having it in print.  David narrates all of his &#34;audio books&#34; and it is as if he is telling YOU his most private and hilarious life just to you.....  LMAO<br /><br />So I down loaded them all!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game. You build a town. Take good care of it. Go on a daily gold mine. And it's just like LIFE. Ups and downs. I suggest this game to everyone.
B0091QSNEE|5.0|My granddaughter loves it.  She thinks it's great to be able to cook for the animals.  We have several of Dr. Panda's apps.  Once you get it all figured out, she plays with them for hours.
B001BANK32|5.0|After \\"The Stand,\\" this is definitely King's best work. The characters ate fully drawn and realistic and this includes The Overlook Hotel as well, as it features not only as the setting, but a main player in this novel. A must read for any Stephen King fan (the film doesn't shine a light compared to the novel). Classic horror and psychological study of a man fighting his demons and the consequences for him and his family.
1932100660|5.0|I'm still reading the book.  There's a lot of information to digest and share with everyone as I read the book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a very fun game will keep your brain working must play to see I say download why not
B0090EHVMC|3.0|The Lorax was short, which is understandable considering there isn't that much material in the book; we did not expect so many musical numbers. Overal it was only ok.
B001QB9H1A|5.0|seriously can i say more?... jason statham!!! ohh yeah!! pure awesomeness!!! kicks ass, drives car! shoots  guns, get laid, makes money, and gets away with it all!
B000062YB1|5.0|This is the album that turned me to Slayer. It is a must have for any metalhead to have in his library. I know of alot of people who are not so fond of Slayer music. But when I let them listen to this album to its entirety, they end up yearning for more. The song Seasons in the Abyss, really demonstrates good vocals that anyone can understand. Powerful bass drums, and ripping guitar riffs. All I can say is,&#34;WOW&#34;.
B001M4YZ90|5.0|Its not about knowing how it is, its about getting into the head and of your opponent and making him do it like you want it to be done  so that you know where and when to be for your benefit. (P.S. 420)
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|Will use this as somewhat of a reference guide of sorts for a long-time to come!  Thank You!...  Thank You!...
B000093FLA|5.0|really you will laugh, then cry then laugh, and then laugh some more and did i mention it has lots of action so it intense too!! ohh you'll also laugh (think i make my piont ;) you'll like!
B005ZMUZDU|1.0|I just bought this and the sound is absolutely terrible, it goes up and down. I am very disappointed, because my daughter LOVES this movie and she cant watch it.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is a really epic game  how you kill robots that try to kill you but it's not epic it's the most epic game
B000JQUMPI|5.0|It is a great book about a family of girls growing into fine women. Would be excellent for anyone to read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I couldn't put it down until I completed all ten intro levels.  Please hurry with more!!!<br />Worked fine on my kindle fire.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Well written well thought out and refreshingly original Enders game dares to take the reader on an uncomfortable but heartstoppingly riveting adventure.  Andrew wiggin is a child like no other genetically engineered to save the world.  He is one of the many hopefuls who were government sanctioned and conceived to command a fleet that will save the world as we know it from and alien threat that almost decimated the global population in two previous wars.  I never put this book down and i dont plan to stop reading this author until i finish all of his work- a serious must read !
B000FBFN1U|3.0|Plowing into the third book of the series, there are new characters and new cities and cultures to keep track of. Some of them may have been mentioned earlier, and are now being fleshed out. As each chapter unfolds somewhere involving someone, I started feeling I was reading feature stories in a newspaper about some interesting place I had never been.<br /><br />Still, the book remains interesting, though it's hard not to wonder what happened at the various cliff hangers wher some chapters ended.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Great music!  We really enjoy listening to the whole cd.  Definitely will put all the songs on our playlist!  Going to look for more from them.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|A good idea but it is slow to load and manuver ariound even with my 4G phone. Forecast not all that accurate, but neither is Weather Cahnnel on TV.
B001DUDKEY|5.0|This movie was captivating from the beginning and left me on the edge of my seat until the end. Loved the casting and of course love the story. WOrth watching for certain!
B00BMT9SQA|3.0|I have been a fan of ms streisand's for many years.  This is a very cute movie that only her fans will watch with  great lines and funny scenes.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I enjoyed the quick page turner....good story line for summer beach reading for teens as well as the older crowd.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|I liked the story up until the end.  Some of King 's stories tend to fall apart at the end for me.  I saw the story ending in a different way.  If you like time travel stories and are a King Fran you would probably like it.
B00B7G3Y4U|3.0|I am kind of bored with the series now. Not sure if I will watch anymore of them unless they make it a little more entertaining. This one kind of dragged.
B002QQ8HAG|5.0|FASHION IS SOMETHING THAT SOME LIKE TO CRITICIZE,<br /><br />AND PRETEND THAT THEY DON'T 'BUY INTO', BUT IT IS SO IMPORTANT<br /><br />TO CULTURE TO HISTORY, TO HOW WE SEE OURSELVES AND OUR<br /><br />PLACE IN OUR SOCIETY. ANNA WINTOUR HAS ONE TOUGH JOB. ITS A VERY GOOD DOCUMENTARY/<br /><br />BIOGRAPHY.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Love that Peter Jackson sticks so close to the books. They were my favorite growing up. Just wish I didn't have to wait so long to see the rest of them in 3 parts.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|The Piano Guys are fantastic and I can't wait to see them in concert. I will have the next CD in  short time.
B00BRPH4EC|5.0|Him has never let me down. Every album they put out is a masterpiece of musical perfection that no one can ever nor will ever match. I am and will be a fan of these guys forever
B003VS0CWY|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  Over the years I have<br />watched this movie over and over and over again.
B002VH7P4O|5.0|With  a flash inface with music in Flac and Mp3 the USB drive is a very good choice for your collection
B001NLL93W|5.0|I was about to give up on this series. So glad the &#34;oh no, he's my brother not my boyfriend&#34; part is over. It was never be,is able anyway.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|It's like a box with many mini LP's. With High quality and diferente sound from the stereo ones. It's a good choice
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Took me a while to figure this game out. Maybe there should be a tutorial or more detailed instructions. I had to google help with the first level. Fun and challenging game but too short. Looking forward to new levels.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Just absolutely amazing!! I recommend everyone to read. One of the best books I have ever read. Amazing!! Fantastic!! Astounding!
B001XULSG6|4.0|A storyline that tied into the original Star Trek (Zephraim Cochran), Next Gen's most formidable villain (the Borg) and the foundation for Star Trek: Enterprise (the Vulcans' first landing on Earth). Plus, the delightfully creepy Borg Queen and a solid performance from Patrick Stewart. It's one of the few Star Trek films I can rewatch now and then and not grow tired of it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses and this is just amazing I would definitely rate this on a scale of one to ten eleven get this app
1932073221|3.0|Long on text and short on practicality.<br /><br />I read most of the book but didn't finish it, kind of lost interest in it.
0307950689|5.0|So much happening .... I literally could not put this book down!  Lost a lot of sleep reading Lost Symbol!  This is best of Dan Brown to date.  Can't wait to see the movie.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This movie was a nice surprise. Very funny and well animated. Whoever thought this one up is a genius. 5 stars
0307346617|5.0|ok I brought thiss to read before I saw the movie. I saw the movie and it is not anything like the book. I knew it would not be after reading the book. I really enjoied the book
B00CF34B2I|5.0|The touch controls on the kindle fire are smooth and responsive. The single player game is fun and doesn't feel like your wasting your time playing it.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|I'm a sucker for these.  Part three wasn't my favorite but I feel like the formula was back in GP.
B008DYZKQE|4.0|A wonderful story I used to read my sister. Now I read it to my son. He loves the ending and always adds &#34;and she is much happier with out that bum!&#34;
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is great! I enjoy playing it a lot and customer setvice is right there for you if any issue arrises.
B0082XJGRK|4.0|Slow at times, but unexpected, precious gems on the pages. One thing that changed my way of thinking is something that seems obvious, but 2000 years ago, Marcus knew that only distractions stand between you and your goals.<br /><br />Very contemporary wisdom, applicable to daily life.
141659521X|5.0|This, like all of Vince Flynn's books was a great read.<br /><br />I will sincerely miss Mitch Rapp.  Thanks for all the entertaining books you wrote for us.  RIP Mr. Flynn and Mitch Rapp.<br /><br />There will be one more coming out later this year which I look forward to reading.  I hope no one decides to write under his name.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|You have to watch the episode that got it all started. Love the look of the enterprise and the crew. You should watch.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a page turner--did not want to put it down.  Was very creatively written, full of suspense, and I actually gasped as I read the ending!
B0062QRTKA|1.0|couldnt be a worse mock up of the bible. one star serves this app right. this is very offensive to many christians, but please people if you dont like it , why complain?
B000002KDM|5.0|James Taylor's range of sweetness and funkiness is in display here. As always his musicians compliment the styles also. Love hearing the collaboration with Joni Mitchell again. Nostalgic CD to love anew or for the first time.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I Loved it. Beat the game fairly quickly but still a good game. I can't wait for more levels!!!! It's a good game that makes you think.
B009LREA1S|5.0|While I liked it it didn't love it upon initial viewing in theaters last year, the more I watched it, the more I enjoyed the conclusion to a rejuvenated franchise that seemed dead after Batman and Robin. Gret balance of Wayne and Batman, wonderful job by Hardy playing Bane and Hathaway playing Catwoman was a great scene stealer
B0065CCM76|4.0|I was never a big Seger fan growing up, not that I disliked him but I guess I was not really aware of his catalog. However, after listening to this album and remembering all those really cool songs that I always bobbed my head and tapped my foot to but never bothered to know the artist, I was pleasantly surprised. He is classic American rock, and I wish I had picked up on him earlier.<br />There are only a few songs on this that I had never heard before, but other than that this compilation is a solid must have on your iPOD if you'e into classic American rock.
B0064J6OMO|3.0|that even Jason Bateman and Leslie Mann couldn't quite salvage.  I can imagine the pitch between cigar chomping studio bosses: \\"okay we're gonna go with the freaky friday slash trading places stuff ya see but this time it won't be age, gender, race, or net worth ya see?  It's gonna be a stoned swingin' bachelor ya see and an uptight lawyer with a family ya see?  The guys get mad with each other and the wife but they all make up in the end ya see?  Fellas we got a winna here.\\"
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is so much fun!!!!! You<br />should totally get this!! I really like this game!!! It's the best I  have ever played
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Bought this for the long airplane trip and downloaded it to the iPad.  Worked great!  Game of Thrones is a really interesting story with great characters.
0670026557|2.0|Develop a thought, create some novel jargon, then apply that jargon to redefine common situations, and a book is born.  Formulaic business books have become the norm, and this effort tumbled into tedium after only a couple chapters. It's a thought, not a book.  The most baffling part of this book is the high praise on its jacket.  Were the reviewers talking about the same book?  Adam Grant is, by his own definition, a Taker - he Gives very little that's memorable.
B003U4UPHG|4.0|Season 1 was the most addicting but season 2 is good too!!!  I love how they build the characters. So good!
B000SEGUDE|5.0|This novel is so rewarding for the reader. I felt the further I delved into these stories more I understood and loved. There is a lot to offer here. Each story is written so impeccably different from the others, the characters have distinct and beautiful voices. I watched the movie first, but this could be enjoyed immensely without the background of seeing it. Mitchell has a wonderful gift that he uses to transport the reader to not one (as the usual novel offers) but six fantastic places that will teach and excite. This is one of those rarities that I think I must read again.
B00A2LFXVI|5.0|Great to watch the first part and this second part of this Batman.DVD. This is how Batman should be. Excellent!!
B002K0WBXW|5.0|This movies is too funny, Sandra Bullock, Betty White, Ryan Reynolds mad a good team is this movie, when Sandra dance its too funny.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I would have to say this game is just OK. Another attempt at Amazon to rule the world, ads for nothing. If you play this you will begin to feel real stupid for falling for their add machine.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It was a decent game! I wish there were more levels. So I can not wait for them to come out with more. Hopefully its sooner than later.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I found this to be far superior to both the default Thunderbolt and Galaxy S4 keyboards. Having a keyboard that learns from outside sources and customizes is a godsend.
B000NGTJTY|4.0|We really enjoyed the movie but at one point did ask ourselves, &#34;How long IS this thing??&#34;  We were left with one or two questions at the end, but all in all, a good flick with several twists and turns.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is very addictive I absolutely love it. It really feels like you own a real horse! I would recommend this ti any animal lover's!  It is by far the best game that is free! On a scale of 1-100 it is infinity b/c of how fun it is!!!!!!! Thank you for creating this awesome magnificent game! I LLLLLOOOOOVVVVVEEEEEEE THIS  GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00CDT41RY|3.0|Way too much blood and violence otherwise I would have enjoyed it much more, however good story and great acting. You don't need all that other crap when you have good actors playing good characters in a good story!! come on!
B00821OX98|5.0|I have really enjoyed this show.  I have actually caught up to the 3rd season, great show!  I was not sure I would be into it, but it is actually very well done.
B001DM1VXE|2.0|I'm sure some people would like this but it wasn't for me.  I like a movie with a good plot, suspense and a puzzle to figure out but this was dark, dreary, obvious and tedious.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What a refreshing show! Love my public television but sometimes can't catch the shows when they air. Very glad I have my Prime membership and can enjoy the episodes on line!
B009NY43NY|5.0|I already predicted the ending a few books prior in the series.<br /><br />However, that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy the read, because I did. Sookie Stackhouse will remain in my library for all time, and I've read through the series more than once and never get tired of them.<br /><br />Charlaine, you're an awesome writer, and have such insight; you're high on my most admired author list.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this app it's just like Mario but better. You can throw acorns. It's probably 7+ rating. A boredom buster and AWESOME.I would recommend this app.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Believable and exciting. I will read his other books. I liked the way it was put together. It added a little extra stress to the novel.
B008A4NGZE|5.0|What a great singer, his lirics are simple and beautiful, he has a very sweet and engaging way of singing.  More of him....
B000UZPIAW|5.0|I'd been meaning to read this book for quite a while.  I've been a Motley fan for years (about 30 of them) and had heard this was a good read.  Well, that's quite the understatement.  I liken this to being on a speeding train that is heading right toward a solid brick wall and not being able to do anything to stop it or to save yourself.<br /><br />You get immediately engaged and wrapped up in his story.  You don't know which end is up.  You're right there with him the whole time.  There are times when he writes in his journal that he's clean and then you start to understand that he was lying even to himself.  Addiction is like that I guess.  He pulls on your heartstrings as he discusses in his stupor his relationships with his family and bandmates.  He makes you laugh as he describes the foibles of others.  And, in the end, he breaks your heart as he flatlines (even though you knew he did and somehow survived).  Maybe Nikki Sixx is too evil to die.  Or maybe, just maybe, he's too important to die.  He will someday, as we all will.  But, he still has important things to do.  His story will impact others and his efforts today will and does save lives.
B00867GHS8|3.0|I bought this for my grandaughter for the 3d. The picture quality was good. I didn't know you get 5 of the same dvd in different formats.
074322454X|5.0|Stephen Ambrose wrote a great book recounting the real story of the 101 Airborne from training camp to the occupation of Hitler's Eagle Nest retreat. Ambrose writes in such a way that we as readers relate easily with the troops. From being parachuted behind enemy lines in the early hours of D Day to their fight in Holland, operation \\"Market Garden\\" and the battle of the bulge, the author makes the story fluid and interesting! Highly recommend!
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I kept seeing that tall guy in 'the Big Bang theory' as the main character,  which made this book more entertaining for me. This is a classic yarn to be made a movie. I hope an Aussie film company makes this.
B0008G2IRO|5.0|I was very happy to finally own the physical version of this album.  I love the Gorillaz and have been following them for a long time.  I really enjoyed the artwork and the way the album opens up to reveal all the characters.  The songs are great, the band is great.  This is a perfect addition to humanities musical albums.
B003FFEX8C|1.0|I can't believe how bad this movie is. And I was expecting Halle to be smoking hot, and she was not. If you love watching crappy movies, watch this one! Yeah!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|once you start you won't want to put the game down. Quite simple to complete the levels and suitable for children to play. Now I want this game on my phone.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|This is a fun movie. I would say that, of the four that have been made (up to this point, cause I'm sure there are more to come), this is the second best in the series.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is perfect for anyone who likes games like temple run or subway surfers. It is great for kids too. I love it
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Ton of fun to watch and Mark Ruffalo is a great Hulk. Not really much to say about the plot or anything. Just a fun movie.
B00CBRH4YU|5.0|This is an extraordinary film meditation on the ambiguities and ambivalences of love and their insinuation into the ultimate meaning and purpose of a human life. The relationships depicted are imperfect works of art, sometimes repellant, sometimes sublime, but in retrospect they invariably define the mystery that is faith. The religious tonalities of To The Wonder are Christian, but not in a dogmatic or even didactic way. There is no attempt to persuade here; there is only a witnessing to what is, at the same time, both achingly particular and surprisingly universal.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I played this games for hours, finished almost all of the games.  it is great fun. I would definitely recommend it.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|No issues so far. The app gives you more specific information about your battery so you will know how much reading time you have vs  how much video time you have left.
B0067R0APK|5.0|I think this. App is fantastic!  Use it on my kindle fire so great!  I have not had any problems with bugs.  Love it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is really cool and easy for everyone. I got this for my 10 year old daughter and she had a really easy time
B0062QRTKA|5.0|Open Sea is a Well Designed, Enjoyable, Humorous and Challeng game.  You play Mo and lead your people through the Sea (by Parting it) on a journey to safety.  Along the way, many of your people are Lazy, Drunk, Slow, etc and will Drown if you don't do the right things.  Dangers like Villains and Evil Ships can thwart your efforts.  Powers are acquired to Part the Sea, Produce Lightning (to speed up slow people, wake up Sleepers or Kill Villains).  You can also Widen the Parting effects, Re-Close the Sea on Villains, etc along the way.  You also lead them to an ARK to continue the dangerous journey.<br />There are also Heroes with special Powers to perform Miracles that can help you on your journey.<br /><br />All Graphics are Sharp and Vibrant.  Music and Sound Effects are pleasant and either can be Muted.<br />The Excellent Instructions are written on Stone Tablets and are well done with Cute Humor added.<br />Looks like about 80 Levels and 5 additional SPECIAL CHALLENGE GAMES that can be hard to master.  A nice level map shows your Route, level Status and Stars won for each level. Levels can be Replayed!<br /><br />Overall, a Marvelous app that is HIGHLY POLISHED.  No Intrusive Permissions or In-app purchase annoyances.  Smooth gameplay with good Controls, great Instructions and progressive difficulty that builds your skills gradually in a sensible and methodic way.  The Humorous Moses-like Theme is done in a Cute, Non-Offensive and Enjoyable way with no agenda except to create Fun Time challenges. Refreshingly Clean, Safe and Engaging Fun.  Kudos to Pixelizers for developing an awesome app!
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I love the way Hosseini can describe the subtleties of human emotion.  I only wish it didn't make me cry so much.
B005DC68NI|5.0|As a beginner who doesn't know anything about the publishing world I consider myself fortunate to have found this book. There is more knowledge compacted into the pages than I could have hoped for. Just the references at the back save hours and hours of searching. Thank you David.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|Want worth the money or the time - i wouldn't even rent this at the dollar box or bother on cable
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|This movie is not for small young children, but teens and ALL ADULTS should watch it. It shows just how Good will always wein out over evil . This is one of these movies that 20 years from now people will be loving
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|this movie i found to be not all that humorous we did not even finish watching it it was just juvenile and vulger
B000256TD0|5.0|It is awesome! My son really loves it. Will buy the others from the rest of the Back to the Future movies.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Doesn't matter how good or bad the book it because when you get it for free, how can it be anything but 5 stars?
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I like the UI . It cleans your device very well. I have tried a couple before but I really like the ease of this app. It's simplistic approach is awesome. Love love love this app
B00B8WXFWE|4.0|I was surprised on how good this CD is, I'm not a big fan, this is the better one from all the other CD's
B0046B8GEQ|1.0|It dose not have subtitle, Also the quality is not good at all......... I prefer to watch it by DVD then here.
B001QJUX24|5.0|I love the connections to Star Wars, Star Trek, Lawrence of Arabia and other iconic movies.  A little repetitious by today's standards but worth it
B00887490Y|3.0|I have the tape,but have not seen it yet.  Like I said before I buy them,but do not see them right away
B007704HO6|4.0|Touching story, well Worth reading. I checked out youtube afterwards to see Bob and his master. I would definitely recommend it. I'm waiting for the next one to come out on kindle.
B00CUB5PNY|5.0|I played this game on my computer and absolutely loved it, so when I saw the app for Royal Envoy I had to get it. It's great to play when I have some free time, and when my son hasn't confiscated my kindle. If you haven't tried this time management game, you should. I didn't try the free app, I went right for the full one and have no problem with it.
B0041KBWM0|4.0|like it, interesting show, that is set at a time today's youth would not understand, amazon more words, too much
B0085YOD1A|3.0|I barely use this.  I really do not see the point of this app as the battery indicator is on the top.  This app will be removed from my device shortly.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|So much fun! A bit challenging on some levels but worth it! Different from many games because you actually have to think about what you're doing!
0965586804|3.0|I purchased this book for a history class that I'm enrolled in.  However, I find that it is not easy to read and there are no pictures.  I really don't like the way its written.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Way better than 100 floors. You do have to figure out the clues to get the items the items you need,  but they are not indecipherable as in 100 floors.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is a Wonder, just like Auggie. I have NEVER read something like this. But boy am I glad I did read it. I LOVE it so much. At first I was shaky and not sure about it. But after reading a little bit more I LOVED it so much<br /><br />THANK YOU R.J. PALACIO for writing this WONDERful book!!!!
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Great seeing all those great Marvel characters together. And some funny moments. I don't want to give away any spoilers.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|This game is so awesome. It reminds me of the Mario Brothers game. My 7 year old daughter plays this game and LOVES it!! It has all different worlds you have to solve. Its FUN!!!
0763644765|4.0|This is a very simple book with very few words and my boys love it!  It has colorful oil paintings for the illustrations and my boys love the parts where they get to yell &#34;I did it!&#34; and &#34;Undies&#34;.  However, there are a few pages told through pictures with no words and the boys didn't understand them, so I had to add my own script.  That's the only drawback I have found!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging, but not painfully so. Just enough.  I enjoyed it immensely!  The interface was easy to use and intuitive.  I look forward to future levels!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I was addicted almost at episode one.  Acting is superb and doesn't need to be raunchy with tons of inappropriate content to get you hooked on the plot, the characters, and the experience.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|What could possible be the point of two such worlds as described here.  It suggest that our earth<br /> World is a terrible proving ground for a cruel God.
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|Wow!  This CD blew me away!  This is the best one yet.Still Hanson but all grown up. I have always been a Hanson fan but this one is superb and I am 54 years old...  yeah I am one of the grown up Hanson fans who actually appreciate the fact that these guys stayed with the music for the music. They did music and themselves very proud.  VERY WELL DONE!!!!!!!!!!!  I'd give a 100 stars if I could.
B009FZFONO|5.0|My sister kept bugging me to watch this, so I finally borrowed her Blu-ray versions of seasons 1 and 2. What impressed me was that the horror in this series is not about the monsters, but about the people. I'm a big fan of Japanese anime and manga, and there are some interesting similarities between those forms of media and Walking Dead. Both are character driven; ordinary people in extraordinary situations, driven, twisted, broken, surviving. Nothing is black and white: the &#34;good guys&#34; are flawed and make mistakes, the &#34;bad guys&#34; are often sympathetic and have reasons for doing what they do. Anything can happen; anyone can die at any time. Knowing that creates an uncertainty and tension in the audience which mirrors the experience of the characters. The series arouses the key elements of Aristotelian tragedy in viewers: pity, and fear. It's a remarkable achievement I did not think television capable of.<br /><br />The third season would make Sophocles smile. Madness and hubris run rampant, driving the action towards terrible, fated tragedy. My sister will buy the 3rd season Blu-ray when it comes out, but I couldn't wait and ordered the streaming video. I have acceptable, but not great, broadband, Episodes play perfectly with high, HD quality. Writing, direction, editing, and acting are all superior.<br /><br />If you have avoided the series because it is &#34;just another zombie show&#34;, consider viewing a few episodes of the first season. Avoid spoilers. And remember, the horror isn't the zombies, it's the people.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|It was a good movie i found it too be very entertaining the acting was superb see this movie soon.
B00BHMF578|5.0|well done story about something a lot of us followed closely on the news back when it happened - if it was a book you would not be able to put it down
B00992CF6W|4.0|They said that the best guess when 9.0 would come out was May but it,s June  almost July they should work harder
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game...better than 100 floors...you know the answer is somewhere in the room, you just have to find it...or them.
1450419895|5.0|I could not be happier with this amazing volume on Strength Training Workout + Anatomy. Tons of useful inside information not the general stuff that is pasted over many publications. Never pretentious, language is straight forward with plenty of useful suggestions if you are serious on doing things with proper form what to avoid and why and so on. Get your copy you will not be disappointed.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|love this game and there is a walkthrough on the net cause i get stuck and then frustrated. played 4 hours and enjoyed every minute
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|it is really hard to control and kinds boring if u want a good hair game I would get Toca hair salon 2 it is worth the money
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This was  a lot of fun to read.  The characters are quirky and heart-warming as is the setting in a small Irish village where everyone knows everyone else's business.  Although the plot is a bit predictable, the author does a good job of drawing you in and there are parts where I found myself laughing out loud.  The interspersed segments about life growing up in the orphanage are a bit harsh and difficult to read.  A literary opus it is not, but if you want something fun and easy to read that makes you feel better for having read it, I would recommend the Misremembered Man.
B0001I561E|5.0|This movie is great for both young and old. It has great humor and a pretty good storyline. It even has a love story!
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Hey, it's free and works on my kindle which I keep by my bed. I prefer it to my cell phone, which I don't like having bedside at night. It has nice features for setting recurring time, dates, etc. The volume escalates and if you have music loaded, you can use a song rather than an alarm tone.
B000F8O35U|4.0|This movie is pretty good. Like most Disney movies, this one has humor and story for both young and old!
B000VZD8TO|4.0|I really liked this book. I'm not one for reading things like this but it perked my interest and I read it in 2 sittings. Really enlightening and motivational in a way. Made me want to be a better person. I recommend it. It's a light read so nothing too intense. Go get it!
B003DZX44I|5.0|What a great story about finding out that what is on the inside is what matters the most. Great flick!
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|The true Ryche has returned!<br />I cannot put into words how amazing this album turned out. Each time I listen, it gets better. It has that almost spiritual mystique to it that hearing the new QR albums for the first time had back in the RFO and OMC days.<br />The only time you notice that the singer is not Tate is when you say to yourself \\"Damn, Geoff is kicking ass on this song!\\", then you remember \\"Oh yeah, Geoff WISHES he could sing like that again...\\"<br />Bravo!! Well done, guys, well done!!! You have shown who holds the TRUE Queensryche flame. I can hold my head high again when I say I listen to Queensryche.<br />I have not been this happy for new QR since I heard the 5 tracks with Chris Degarmo on the Tribe album.<br />After the 5th full listen of this CD today, I can say it's clearly obvious what the problem has been all along (at least since after HITNF). Or rather, who...<br />I can't wait to play this album for all of my friends who have given up on QR since HITNF.<br />The only thing that could possibly make this any better would be if Chris Degarmo joined this lineup (with Parker still onboard of course - come on, Iron Maiden did it).
B00AHXIC50|4.0|Bruno has some really good songs on this album. I really like the Moonshine song. It almost has an old school Michael Jackson sound to it.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|It is very nice to finally have the entire series in one box. The extras are also a very nice treat. Cannot recommend this set enough.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great book with great suspense. It's really hard to stop reading.<br /><br />The characters are great and the writing is easy flowing.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|At the very end of level 10, on the last item I need,  the game screws up. Every time I click on where the item is,  it goes to a close up of the vent and then I'm stuck. I'm not even close to the vent. So frustrating! I was enjoying the game until then.
6305327084|5.0|This is such a cool movie. It's good for anyone that goes through that odd time of transitioning from being a kid to being an adult.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This story had me captivated from the first chapter. I really enjoyed the male perspective. Caught myself many times laughing out loud.
0802473156|5.0|Great wedding gift, shower gift, just because you want to learn how to be more successful in your marriage, as a parent, in business, etc.<br /><br />Buy it!
B009MYARIK|3.0|I am too old and conservative to appreciate the premise of this story.  When woman &#34;fall in love&#34; with different men on a nightly basis, I guess I don't approve.  I feel they are fools and don't value themselves.  They certainly do not value their bodies in the manner that I was raised.  The writing is good.  The characters seem real and the writing style is creative, that is, changing the point of view from chapter to chapter.
1881273377|5.0|I highly recommend it.  I gave it as an engagement gift, and it was a big hit!  Buy it now!
B0017TFLBQ|3.0|Love the games unfortunately they were not compatible with my operating system. I was hoping that it wouldn't be a problem but it was
0802473164|5.0|I bought this as an engagement gift for the groom and he loved it.  I HIGHLY recommend.  what are you waiting for?  Buy it!
B000VE439Y|5.0|An in depth analysis of the real roots of Christianity and even some fun stuff for the &#34;ancient alien&#34; nerds.
B000683VI4|5.0|I had already viewed this movie, but wanted my own copy, it is a classic! My wife loves it, viewed a few times now.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|I am pretty new to the whole Zombie culture, but I really enjoyed this movie. After watching World War Z last weekend, I got really curious about the whole Zombie thing! Warm Bodies was a teen movie, a chick flick with a Zombie twist - really fun to watch.
B0086700CM|5.0|was the first app I EVER got on my Kindle LOVED IT EVER SINCE  THEN! I got temple run brave, temple run OZ,  And temple run 2. Great app for skilled thumb and tilt players.
1885167776|5.0|I like inspirational entrepreneur books--this is by far the best. I read it all in one sitting. The &#34;aha&#34; moments were there--the observations right on point. No rehash of the usual success &#34;rah rah&#34;--this was very enlightening. Finding theONE thing makes so much sense. You can not be good at all things, but you can can be damned good at ONE thing (at a time). A very important book to read! Highly recommend
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|The action and special effect were good. I love the Die Hard movies but Bruce was underwhelming.  I was looking for wires in some of his scenes and dialog like &#34;Hey&#34; was used way too much.  The befuddled looks on his face in many scenes just couldn't overcome the weak or no dialog in order to move to the next scene. It was so bad at time it was pissing me off.  Too mechanical of acting to the point it was boring and I just wanted it to be over. Wouldn't watch it again.  Willis needs to get better writers because he is a better actor than the performance he had here.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|this game is so great you will not know what else you will be possible what to do with your spare time.to reiterate the game is perfect
B005I4JG80|5.0|Really good book. Nice read with lots of interesting info and life stories. I was so surprised that infants can be thought to sleep through the night.
160774273X|5.0|Love the content, though I have not yet tested any of the recipes. I'm certain I will be thoroughly pleased though.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|it's an ok book.  the x-rated sex didn't bother me, it was the writing in general.  I don't usually criticize books, but this one was just not as good as I expected.  Bits of conversation were repeated way too many times.  I don't think Christian's psychological problems were totally explained,  all the happy endings were like a Disney cartoon. The original 3 women and men in story ended up with each other?  Too easy.
B00DBSZEH2|5.0|I have been waiting for this movie to come out on DVD.  I watched it alot.  I'm glad that I didn't go to the movies to see this.  With watching it several times - I saw stuff that I would have missed in the movie theater
B00AG472DS|4.0|I bought this copy of Zodiac in hopes of seeing a crystal-clear amazing Blu-ray transfer. It was marginally better than the DVD. I would hardly call it amazing. I feel that so many of these Blu-rays that keep pouring out arent really worth the bother if you already own a good Dvd transfer. Perhaps the newer CGI movies offer a greater incentive to upgrade.<br /><br />I would certainly recommend getting the Zodiac Special Edition in either DVD or Blu-ray. The Bonus Features are amongst the best that have ever been available for a movie of this kind.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Bought this for my mother-in-law because I knew she loved the show. Over Christmas we watched the whole series in 3 days. I am hooked!
B0031RS4V6|5.0|As always Lee Child captures his readers and weaves a tale of intrigue and courage to solve yet another mystery.
B0071MDA2U|5.0|This book is amazing!total page turner I couldnt stop reading this and the other books in the trilogy! Highly reccomend
B00AYB0SX4|4.0|jineffer is a great actrdess in her first or second movie , the story is very good and cast of players is to notch .
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Blooms TD5 Is a tower defence game. You place down your defences in any order you want and you try and pop the wide veriety of balloons before they get to your &quot;Base&quot; if you will.  Overall Blooms TD5 is a Outstanding game and is worth much more than $2.99.  Heck WHY ARE YOU STILL READING THIS GO BUY!!!!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I think that Kite Runner was one of the best novels I have ever read, and the beginning of And The Mountains Echoed drew me in just like Hosseini's first novel.  However, the emotional pull didn't last very long as the multiple, somewhat disjointed story lines failed to dig deep into human psychology.  The writing was excellent but unfortunately, by halfway through the book, I was ready for it to end.
B008DVJO8C|5.0|This is my first taste of In This Moment and I have to say I love them. Finally, screaming girl power!
B007QJBHRS|5.0|The pretty girl next door meets the wealthy bachelor and the fun begins!  I watch this movie every summer, it brings back my childhood when things were &#34;left up to the imagination&#34; and were fun and romantic.  A must see!
B009VYF5E2|5.0|Merlin is coming into his own an this is a very intense season, this series gets better and better!
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|Don't bother trading your pearls for treasure. It totally  rips you off of pearls! Took 6 pearls for 120 sand dollars! Just so you  know.
B004TJ1H3C|5.0|I loved the show, wasn't completely comfortable with the new Stargate yet but getting there. I was very upset that this is the final season and the movies we were promised never materialized, but I have all my Stargate dvd's to watch over and over again.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Just when you think you have figured it out.........it turns in another direction. Kept me on the edge. Brilliantly written.
B0034G4OUO|5.0|Swa the movie and loved id so I got a good deal and bought it to enjoy with my son. Great action all the way thru and The Rock is excellant and sexy!
B0062QRTKA|5.0|I hate when I buy games and then they're the free app of the day....sigh....it's a great game though give it a shot its an oldie but a goodie definitely a fun game it'll keep you occupied
B004LROMQG|5.0|This series is riveting, I love it! The actors are perfect and the humor between Merlin and Arthur makes the whole series a joy to watch.
1416583432|5.0|How do we know what they are thinking??? This book has insight to the topic and is well written and your dog wants you to buy it.  They really do notice the world differently that do we, and understanding that perspective starts you on the road to being the dog whisperer you want to be.  I, for one, am glad they don't talk.  Yeesh I would be in terrible shape if they could do that.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|I wanted to share these classic movies with my 6-year old.  He loved them and wants to watch them over and over again.  The picture quality via Blu-ray was great.  I'm not an enthusiast, so I didn't catch the changes from the original theater cuts--just not that concerned about it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I usually don't like many of this type apps but I'm really enjoying this one!! it id very very challenging and ive gotten stuck a few timed but even I figure the solution out it is in obvious places. love the challenge!
1402270275|4.0|I'll start off by saying that the cover is gorgeous and I think this was a pretty good start for this series. Wicked as They Come (The Blud Series) by Delilah Dawson truly turned me onto the steampunk vampire genre so I'm always eager to read more. I think the writing was well done and it captured the steampunk/period style perfectly.  I think the plot was well-paced and the relationship between Honoria and Blade developed nicely. They both have tremendous responsibilities and hardships, so it's easy to sympathize with them in their own ways.<br /><br />One gripe for me was the choice of name \\"Blade\\" for the leading man.  I constantly found myself thinking about another vampire (or dhampire rather) anti-hero made famous for Marvel comics and Wesley Snipes.<br /><br />Though the book was good, I'm not sure if I want to continue right away based on my personal tastes.  I'm just not sure if I like the brand of vampire that she has to offer.  As overdone as it may be, I will always prefer that they have fangs.  I understand that authors want to make their creatures unique and she accomplishes this to an extent, but I still have my preferences.<br /><br />I think the story will been enjoyable for many of you.  Though it will be like usual paranormal romances and focus on one couple per book,  I don't believe Honoria and Blade are finished with their contribution to the series.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|I have never cared for Tom Cruise and his acting skills. But this movie was awesome. Watched it twice two nights in a row! Great story, great action scenes, funny at the right times.
B00BB8SKPW|2.0|Boring disappointing movie<br />Denzel acts and talks the same - no matter what role he is in.<br />After this movie I don't even like him any more
B000IZJZLM|5.0|One only has to love music to appreciate the magic that this group creates.  Each one has his own strength and brings that strength to the audience.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|I like it better than the previous ones,  but I just started playing it.  If anything changes my opinion. I will comment again<br /><br />I am off to play now,  ta- ta!
B008K8VDPU|3.0|it was not as fun as i thought it would be no full songs and you cant downlad the songs from your phone to the game to play
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This book sent me directly to current info on line because there are at least three kinds of dementia and most of us have encountered at least one. Knowledge is power and is especially needed when monitoring our bodies and minds,
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was so good. There was constantly new twists that you just would never guess what was coming next. It was full of surprises.
0810993139|5.0|Bought for 10yr.old who speaks Swedish and he loved it.<br />Has read all other ones too and has journal for summer.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Easy to expand the area on the kindle and move around. The grandsons like planting different items and watching them grow. They like to bust up arrows and catch the rewards before they disappear. Like watching Nemo and his dad in their home.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I like it keeps your mind thinking. But somethings are way to hard for the regurlar person. But I did anyways. cant wait for the up dates :)
1612680011|3.0|There certainly is some good advice here, especially for the many people who get into credit card debt, purchase homes far beyond their means, and feel the need to buy the most expensive car they can afford with a five-year loan.  Most people perhaps don't realize the added cost of owning a larger home, the additional cost of a pricey car (high-performance tires, premium gas, ect.), and the way credit-card interest rates can ruin everything from your monthly budget to your credit score.  Fine, if you need this kind of advice, and many of us either do or did at one time, then perhaps this book is well worth the cost and the time it takes to read it. Speaking of the time it takes to read it, this information could have been provided in half the amount of words.  After the first few pages, I grew weary of the author going over the same information, the same illustrations, and same general statements over and over again.<br /><br />Also, while it's true that assets like rental property can provide a positive cash flow, for anyone who has owned rentals and dealt with the ramifications of such transactions, like having renters who don't pay on time (if at all), who don't take care of the property, and who then trash the property when they skip town, you know that none of this comes easy.  Yes, rentals are assets that provide cash flow, but it's often a lot of work, time, and effort to manage them.  Is it better than being employed by someone else?  I really think it depends on what you are interested in doing with your life.  This book makes owning assets, like small businesses and rental properties, sound much easier than it really is.
B008G12ERC|5.0|It will give you all kinds of good-feels. I love Muse, and this whole album is full of awesome music. All the songs are awesome, not only the ones that are on the radio.
B002NN5F7A|2.0|Guess I have a funny look at movies but I really did not like the tone or cruelty of the movie.  I can see that every day somewhere.  I like to enjoy a story not cringe.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Every book in this series kept me on the edge of my seat. Each chapter seemed to end with you wanting more-needing to know what happens next!! Quick read, action packed, plot twists, the whole sha-bang.
B00DGXGUSY|5.0|I never thought Amon Amarth could top Twilight of the Thunder God but I think they've pulled off the impossible and done just that. I don't consider myself a death metal fan but there's something about AA that continues to press my buttons. From the very first to the last drum beat Deceiver Of The Gods is brutally relentless with a perfect mixture of melodious guitar riffs, mind boggling speed drums, and of course Johan Hegg's impressive guttural roars, all somehow concocted into one stunning musical performance. Unlike most of the death metal (forgive me for using that trite definition) I have come across it is delivered with absolute precision and clarity. It almost feels it was designed by German engineers, quality tested by the Swiss, DIN approved, and then pounded into submission with dirty bloody clubs by Johan and his gang. What came out the other end is a piece of beauty and a major step forward for Amon Amarth. I'm hooked and if I lose my hearing a year or two early then I'll happily give credit to Amon Amarth. Whatever you're doing - keep it up.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Every book in this series kept me on the edge of my seat. Each chapter seemed to end with you wanting more-needing to know what happens next!! Quick read, action packed, plot twists, the whole sha-bang.
B008FYZIVY|1.0|Has anybody had trouble with DVD's playing?  Season one plays but season two will not. Granted the DVD player is a bit older, but still, the description says formatted for N. America. I love this show but can't say I love the DVD's. Plays fine in my newer Blu-Ray player, but I wanted it for late night viewing in my bedroom, so 0 stars for me!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Every book in this series kept me on the edge of my seat. Each chapter seemed to end with you wanting more-needing to know what happens next!! Quick read, action packed, plot twists, the whole sha-bang.
B00914JWSW|2.0|I don't know why I continue to buy Barbra's music, as I'm usually disappointed.  I saw her in concert in 2000 ..... A dream come true and a check mark on my bucket list...... She was great!  I knew all the words to her songs, but now, as much as I hate to say it..... Time to retire the voice.  Hasn't she got enough money?
B000PMG16U|5.0|It's Star Wars, do I really need to say more? Awesome movies, great quality on the blu-ray. It's a great thing for any Star Wars lover to have.
B008CRC506|5.0|But now I can watch it whenever I want and sing along to all of the fabulous songs this show produced.  Maybe now I can learn some of the dance moves too!  Mean Hilty is a star!,,,,,,
B000PMLFRA|5.0|It's Star Wars, do I really need to say more? Awesome movies, great quality on the blu-ray. It's a great thing for any Star Wars lover to have. According to my boyfriend there are some scenes in the movies that have been added for this edition. It's the only version I've seen, so I can't back that up-but he's a lifelong Star Wars lover and loved this.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|This was a must have for my collection.  One of the best movies ever....and so deserving of the Oscar. I remember the hostage situation, but this really brought to light what it must have been like for the poor people in this horrible situation, as we all sat at home on unscathed land.... Before the terrorists found a way to get to us.  Thank you Ben Affleck for such a wonderful film.  The only thing missing on your mantle is a best director Oscar.  Shame on the Academy!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Its a fun game to play when u have nothing else to do. The only bad thing is it freezes a lot while loading, and finishes loading when u get into wifi range. Other then that a good game.
B00BCZU8WM|2.0|Love Justin but not loving the 20/20 experience.  It need LASIK surgery to fix the short sightedness of this great entertainer.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|.like all the versatilIty works great wake to my music.quick glimpse on the weather.the adjustability of brightness is also a nice feature.
B006RXQ2CY|5.0|No jump cuts, no guns, no explosions, no unbelievable BS, just great acting and a story about people.  Helen Mirren is astounding.<br /><br />I like great adventure films, but recent CGI capabilities have been abused in filmmaking to the point where many movies have no point.  The Queen is a refreshing change of pace, or perhaps a return to filmmaking with an emphasis on people and story..
B004UJAOLM|5.0|It was wonderful. A little out of my league, words a little too out of my vocabulary, but a great read.<br />I loved how Joseph's dialogue was his own, but it was difficult to understand.<br />Everything about the book I loved.<br />I'd recommend this book to anyone who loves old books and has an open mind.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|My boys absolutely love this movie. We saw it at the theater & they couldn't wait for it to come out on DVD.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game to play when you are bored. I just like to play it because it is so addictive, fun, and challenging. A suggestion is that I think that they should add an additional challenge like a super challenge in addition to the daily challenge, which is just collecting letters. The super challenge would relate to the daily challenge like if the daily challenge was &quot;roll&quot; then the super challenge would be &quot;roll 50 times in one run. That would be more of a challenge then collecting letters.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|Aside from tragically anvil-acious dialogue and a leading man whose overhanging brow ridge is a little too pronounced for handsomeness in a homo sapiens sapiens, this was a pretty little movie with, for once, a leading teenage heroine with actual problems, the solutions to which, in fact, are also mostly her own, and not taken care of by..say..vampire love. Emma Thompson and Jeremy Irons, clearly slumming it, appear to be having a grand old time, and there's a supporting role played by a staircase that is really almost Oscar worthy. Truth to tell, it was playing on a flight I took recently, and the sound in my seat was broken, but the visuals alone intrigued me enough to rent it, and I can't say I regret the decision.
B0026Q8EWW|4.0|I was looking for something to pass the time one Saturday morning.  I saw this movie and the star studded cast caught my eye, and turns out this movie was quite entertaining.  I would recommend this movie to anyone.
0756697875|5.0|My boy is absolutely crazy over this. He's read through it multiple times and hauls it around like a textbook.
B00DM0XXCM|3.0|The best thing I can say is that \\"Upside Down\\" might be the first real art film that's accessible to tweens.<br /><br />It's visually stunning. It's evident from the start that the film was made by an auteur. It's a unified creative effort that comes straight from one individual's heart and was interpreted by others who *FELT* the auteur's vision. The actors lovingly render to the best of their abilities some really bad dialogue. So \\"Upside Down\\" certainly scores an A for effort!<br /><br />But sadly, the film doesn't really work because the screenplay feels cobbled together with no sense of cinematic storytelling. The lack of narrative clarity throughout \\"Upside Down\\" speaks to why most films follow a three-act story arc.  Sometimes a lack of structural integrity can actually work onscreen (see \\"Holy Motors\\"). But it doesn't work here because \\"Upside Down's\\" linear, fairytale sensibilities are undermined by its lack of plot cohesion. And I could tell about ten minutes into the film that although it's an English language movie, whoever wrote the dialogue was thinking in another language.<br /><br />\\"Upside Down\\" has soul and it's easy on the eyes, but its lack of brain undermines its heart and style. I do hope the director finds a proper writing muse to work with on his next effort, because there's a lot of genuine talent and vision on display in \\"Upside Down\\" that's not fully realized.<br /><br />Final word? Worth seeing despite its many flaws. It's something special, but not at all perfect.
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|Born Sinner is a great album. I highly recommend it to others. Its more thsn just a good beat you can dance to, J Cole's lyrics are really saying something
B00B29J0I6|5.0|A fun cute game that the kids love, nice graphics. Not a bad game for the free app of the day, but would male a nice purchase.

B004T5K3OK|5.0|Love this software. Use it all the time for classes and work. The &#34;whiteboard&#34; mode alone is worth it's weight in gold
B005GG0MIS|5.0|purchased this book after the recomm from fareed zacharia recomm. very insightful and accurate in content. a must have book
B005LAIH4A|5.0|One of our favorite movies. Yes, there's a pro-environmental propaganda message, but if you agree with the message, it makes the movie that much more enjoyable. Really helped my daughter appreciate trees and the outdoors and that we need to take care of Nature
B000WAXH2Q|5.0|bought this for my mom for her kindle fire. she is a rabid fan as am i. can never go wrong with diana
B004UQ03P2|5.0|The non-retina 13&#34; MBP didn't come with an anti-glare option (or if it did, I couldn't afford it), so I got this product instead. SUPER easy to install and almost as good as the anti-glare on my old 15&#34; MBP. Is it the same? No. Is it good enough? Heck yeah!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|i have read alll of the got books thanks to these products. the dictionary is fabulous. i recomm to all
B004X80QNG|2.0|I picked this app up during a Free App of the Day a good long while back. I try it out every so often over the last year or so. I really wish they'd incorporate widgets. Integration with Tooodledo (or was it Producteev? I forget now) is hit and miss. Sometimes it works. I haven't used the latest version, but have never found it worth the cost.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|love this guy!! didnt realize that i am a foodie until i read this. and what a vocabulary!!! not surprised at all that his career has taken off. and a quick read
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Love this series and wanted to share it with friends. They loved it too! Thanks for getting it to me safe and sound!

B005544V6A|4.0|I found the pilot episode to be entertaining even though the plot was somewhat predictable. If you are a couch potato who just want to be entertained then you may find this to your liking
B0063IH60K|5.0|glad i got this app. i soooo love me some solitaire anytime and any where. i would def recommend this product
B000FILW86|4.0|\\"Rockford\\", (2006), Cheap Trick's 15th studio offering, is a salute to their hometown.  Neilsen, Zander, Petersson and Carlos sound refreshed and full of energy on this disc, they sound like their in here 20's again.  This album begins with the rocker \\"Welcome To The World\\", the sparkle of \\"One More\\", the Beatle-ish  \\"O Claire\\", the single \\"If It Takes A Lifetime\\", the hyperactive rocker \\"Come On Come On Come On\\" and the point blank rock of \\"DeCaf\\".  Just a strong comeback album.  In 2009 they would release \\"The Latest\\".

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|after reading my reviews on calculator products. the price is right. it is very simple to use and has large fonts
B0019IB0II|5.0|This is an excellent book for anyone dealing with a person who has had a stroke or any type of brain injury.<br />I think anyone working with the rehabilitation of a person with a brain injury will benefit from the details she has included about this healing process.  It is wonderful that she was able to write about this with her background so that others can understand the process of how the brain heals. Unlike a broken leg or arm, the brain has to work in its own way to heal and family members and friends need to understand this. I cannot say enough about how helpful this has been to me.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|i loooooove me some bradly cooper!!! read the book, a quick read. followed the storyline well except for thes father/rober deniro part. deviates greatly but it still works well in this sense. recently diagnosed bipolar and confounded what bipolar is and how it rears its ugly head. really helpful in this sense
B000AP04OM|5.0|This is truly a classic, and Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer are just wonderful. Beautiful music, a must-see for everyone who enjoys musicals.
B004SIIBGU|3.0|it doesnt work for my kindle fire. not sure shy this is. prolly not meant to be used for my kindle
B0092G1O8A|5.0|This movie is equal to or better than the book. The cast and directors did a fantastic job interpreting the story and characters. A good action film.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|i gave three stars because i use it on my samsung 2 and the screen isnt big enough for me
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this app is really fun. I really like that one item leads to another.  please make more levels soon!  love it.
B000YPWDSS|5.0|bought this before her sad demise. what a gifted performer, lyrisist, and songwriter. her band was spot on. you wont be disappointed in it. what is it with gifted people and dying so young???
B007URVZJ6|5.0|The book was very informative and detailed. However, kindle has failed to make publishing your own book simple and it is such a pain in the butt that I just decided to self-publish through Amazon and skipped the KDP step. I got it to work initially, but the formatting looked like crap. KDP is a failure for the do-it-yourselfer. It is so complicated that you almost have to hire a professional to help you. And since it is hard to make sales as an unknown poet, I would likely never recover my expense. This book is a well written manual to an extremely complicated process. It wouldn't matter how well it were written, it is the lack of KDP being user friendly that is the problem.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|you can never go wrong with any adobe product. use for  my samsung 2, toshiba lap top, and kindle fire
B0091REZMW|5.0|great game.  lots of variety and fun missions.  wish the tutorial went into how to use the right side tabs.  I still haven't figured them out.

B004P8A7J2|4.0|this film was visually brilliant, and emotionally draining.  Dark, existentially dark, but fascinating. And those cinematic representations of a meth-aphetamine high were, indeed, repeatedly brilliant.  xxx
B0064Z62R0|5.0|bought this after seeing the movie. i was pretty much shocked that i like hawaiin music so much. play it softly at nite and go to sleep right away. used random setting. last track is simply amazing
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Frustrating fun! Play it waaaay more than I thought I would! Please keep this game coming...I may have a problem
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|This is a good CD. If you like QOTSA and what they have done in the past, you will like this.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I loved the whole Hunger Games story.  This was not my favorite of the books but I really wanted to know how it ended, so I read it to the end.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|I absolutely love this show. The only problem i had was the case being banged up round the edges but that was just from shipping and was no biggy.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|The colors are vivid and the alps are grand. What a fantastic improvement to an already classic movie. A must have.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|Great way to pass time. Keeps you entertained for hours at end and great for keeping you busy while waiting around.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Love watching the collection in HD. If you enjoy ST then this is a great value for the trekie in you.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|i would watch again and tell my friend's to watch it as well my wife and i loved the movie
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I absolutely love the game. Great for any MLP fan. Would absolutely play this game daily. Pretty fun for all ages of fans.
B006Y5H74W|4.0|I love musicals and this one is very entertaining. Can't wait to watch more episodes. Great show to watch and enjoy.
B0049J0CTM|5.0|I can see this movie over and over. I can't wait till the second movie comes out! It should be a 3 day rental instead.
1604595647|5.0|If you are unfamiliar with Wilkie Collins, read this and you will be pleased. He wrote at the same time as Charles Dickens. He was a lawyer. His books were some of the first ever serialized which indicates he was popular during his lifetime.<br />Collins was so proud of this book that he had that fact carved in his tombstone.  Ordered this to read with my book club even though it is available on Project Gutenberg. The volume is a great size and the type is large. There is sufficient room on the pages to make notes. The paper is heavy enough that writing with marker will not bleed through.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I enjoyed the story very much. I love that the  speaker changed through out the novel. The characters and story are beautifully intertwined.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|This book is fantastic! I would recommend it to any teen who likes fantasy and action. The only part I didn't like was a certain family relationship between two characters. They shouldn't have been related in my opinion. I can't say what their names are, that would spoil the book...
B00CDSVZHY|2.0|It was a typical Quinton Tarantino picture with his usual over dramatization. That man is a damn mess! Only he would find this entertainment!
0375869026|5.0|This book really inspired my kids who are 8 & 10, I could see the empathy they had for the kid. And the lessons about standing up for kids who are different are great.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|My nephews really liked this movie, so I gave it a shot.  Not bad.  I can see why they'd like it, especially in 3D.
B001AOKA3W|5.0|If you love end of the world movies this is a must watch classic. Realalistically scary...good with popcorn on a rainy day.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|I don't know why but I really enjoyed this movie so much so that I watched it twice. I give 5 stars only to movies that I want to watch over and over again.
B006JD48NM|5.0|I didn't know a whole lot about Senna or this era of F1 before watching this movie, but this definitely got me hooked.  It was well made, a good combo or racing footage, commentary, and interview footage of Aaryton. If anything, the movie didn't focus enough on just how good Senna was early in his career before he actually started winning (he got a lot of pole positions on a second tier team), and it would have been nice to know a little bit more about his early life and pre-F1 career.  Overall a fantasic movie (yes, movie) that pulls you in and will astound you with how amazing this man was.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Overall, this book annoyed me intensely. It was too repetitive, absurd, and frankly, slow. It was supposed to be a page turner, but I just kept turning the pages so I could finish.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I just started playing this game a few weeks ago and it has been fun. I am not a regular game player but this is a nice easy distraction on occasion. I think anyone who plays this game will enjoy it. I do find myself looking forward to playing more than I thought I would! It's good fun!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|My wife calls it a &#34;soap opera with lawyers&#34;, without the cheesy plot lines. To put it simply, it's an entertaining program.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|The only time I have to read books is on vacation. I brought this book with me on a trip to England which was apropos since it took place in London. It was a great read with lots of twists & turns and suspense. Great character development. Just ordered the sequel!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|very addicting gameplay.  enjoying the social aspect of the game as well as the graphics. also love the strategy needed to compete without having to spend money.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|This was a great season of shows! Loved them every one kept you on the edge of your seat! Will watch the next season!!
B005544TRQ|4.0|i love the writing of this show. i laughed when the boss said, &#34;most importantly,&#34; to gabriel macht, &#34;I am taller than you are.&#34;  while he's short compared to his female lead, gabriel macht's appearance makes me smile. and i'm usually not a shallow woman :)
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Already owned multiple seasons, but couldn't pass this deal up to have the complete series!  This is a great show, with a lot of drama and some great dry humor that you need to see multiple times to catch all the little quick hit one-liners!
B00992CF6W|5.0|WHO EVER MADE THIS GAME I SWEET ONCE I WENT TO THE NETHER A BUNCH OF GOOD STUFF MY BROTHER SAID THAT NETHER GAURDS WILL POP OUT BUT IT DID NOT HAPPEN HE LIED
B000FC1HBY|4.0|I started reading the books because I can't want til all of them (hopefully) air on HBO.  While they are different from the tv show, i was pleasantly surprised that the tv adaptation does not stray from the heart of the story.
1592332803|5.0|I got this book as a gift 2 years ago. Im finally writing a review because its just that good! I am not much of a baker, I prefer cooking. This book never fails! My stepdaughter recently picked out a recipe for her birthday dessert that we'd never made before. I warned her that since we haven't made them yet they might not turn out good. We made mint chocolate chip cookies and they were AMAZING!! I make the peanut butter chocolate cupcakes as a cake for birthday parties and its a big hit. Chocolate peanut butter no bake pie is also a favorite!
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|I like the movie and would recommend to all ages.  Very inspirational.  That's all I have to say.  thank you.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Not as good as his other books. Too many loose ends for me. I like a beginning,middle and end. Sorry
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fantastic because I can play on it and the game Is so much fun and I know that it looks easy
B000I5X824|5.0|Wasn't totally sure what I was getting because I just like music and while I know some Staind songs, I don't know all...what a great CD and a pleasant surprise!  Love it!
B008BU75IQ|4.0|Archer saga about the Clifton Barrington Family is a great read for the summer but I want to know more about little Jessica in the next book.<br /><br />Would recommend for a summer read.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Not a bad hidden object game. Not too hard or too easy. The free version is frustrating because it stops in the middle of a chapter and makes you purchase the full game version in order to continue.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|This book is great, well written and gripping!  Love Ken Follett, can't wait to read book 2, thank you a<br />Ken!!!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|It was a beautiful read and I was absolutely hooked from the first chapter.  I enjoyed the parallel to life that all of us could really find strength in reading.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Love the game,my only complaint would be the ads that interrupts every  couple of moves you make. I would not mind paying for the game to stop the ads
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Needs new levels asap!! Great game for kids as well as adults. Going to download for my phone as well
B005LHOKFS|5.0|LOVE this site, real people writing real reviews......then good, the bad and the ugly. Have found the reviews to be spot on.
B00005NGAL|5.0|My  23 year old is really in to these types of musicals and theatre type shows.  Got it for her for Christmas and she loves it.
B00COGZ8FU|1.0|I find it hard to believe that any of those awarding this movie more than one star have actually read any Jack Reacher books. If they havent then that is their excuse. However for those who have been fans of Lee Childs character this movie has destroyed their character completely.  Tom Cruise may be a reasonable actor but its obvious that once again he is only able to play himself no matter what the theme.  This movie was the first opportunity to introduce another 'James Bond' or 'Jason Bourne' instead it was just another 'Tom Cruise pretending to be tough' movie. For those fans of the books it was great news to hear that at last Jack Reacher was about to make his appearance on the screen - they hardly expected Tom Cruise and not a single one has come out and said they were happy with his portrayal of a 6'5\\" 230lb hero. I have watched the movie and find the scenes of Cruise facing(and looking UP at) the villains totally ridiculous. In fact it was much more like a remake of Hiram Holliday(in itself not a bad thing).<br />Sorry but Tom Cruise turned a blockbuster option into a mediocre flop and Lee Child has lost a whole lot of books fans along with it.<br />If you want to watch an action movie there are hundreds just like this - if your expecting a 'Jack Reacher' movie - you will be VERY dissapointed !
B004TI5N38|5.0|True to form David Baldacci delivers a suspenseful story with great characters.  This is not one to be missed for Baldacci readers!
B0058YPLA2|5.0|I would recommend this show to anyone who likes story tales! Neat spin on old fairy tales, the characters work well with each other.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|the story was good, but it really wasn't told in a very exciting way. Didn't grip me.... or keep me interested
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|I could not put this book down .  It was so eloquently written and it told a story of love and loss so passionately.  Waiting for the next book
0446547638|1.0|I very much disliked this book.  As a matter of fact over halfway through it I started getting the feeling that I didn't want to finish it so I flipped to the back, read the last chapter or whatever & discovered I was right.  I can't say why I didn't like this book without spoilers so...<br /><br />**SPOILER ALERT**<br /><br />I hate books that don't have happy endings.  For some reason I can deal with movies that are that way, but with books I get too involved with the characters.  So once I started getting that feeling & then confirmed it wasn't a happy ending I just put it in my donation book box.  If they make this one into a movie I might go see it though.<br /><br />He does write some pretty great books though, so hopefully the next one will be more my type.  ;-)
0738737909|5.0|I can't stop looking at the card in this pack they are so beautiful and the characters are full of life and character. This pack of tarot cards it is a feast for the eyes. Just what I have been looking for.
B000V39KDO|5.0|Great movie. Great action. Good story. definitley a movie for guys. The visuals are even better in high definition on bluray.

B00BHHIWQO|4.0|This is a fun game. I would not mind if the screen was bigger...but that's my device probably. It is another bejeweled type game.
B006UKFFE0|4.0|Running lean is must read for any startup and entrepreneurs who are thinking about Startup. In addition to Steve Blank's books, this one will be handy one for any entrepreneur.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Ending isnt the greatest but the book itself is uplifting. Gives a great perspective on what awaits on the other side.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This game is a lot of fun, with lots of challenging tracks, and great upgrades.  It's enormously entertaining.  I do recommend it to anyone that liked &quot;Excitabike&quot;.
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|This book is very different to The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns and was not quite what I was expecting. It is more about the life of an afghan family after they leave Afghanistan than about the struggles of living in Afghanistan. It is a delightful story about a family separated and their journey to reuniting but it is not a can't put it down book like Khaled Hosseini's other books were for me.
B008S0IJAM|3.0|I really like labrador and slip and roll. The rest were just okay. Not up to the standard that Aimee Mann has put out for so many albums.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|There is nothing wrong with this game and I love everything about it BUT if you don't like challenging games I wouldn't play this
B0063GORYU|5.0|What can I say? This is a very fun app and it is an easy game to learn to play.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is very addicting and it is a game that I play every day. I recommend that you get this game. Over and out.
B00CSR2J9I|1.0|Horrible for kids!  All they want to do is look at a little screen and play the game.  They get mad when you want them to eat, communicate, and play with siblings or friends.  For sure they won’t go outside and play.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fantastic mind game. I love it and can not wait to have more rooms. My husband loved it so that wants to download it also
B0084U0IEG|4.0|Ian Mc Ewan again shows that he is a very good writer, he tells subtle and deep stories. It is not one of the best books, however is also a good one.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Seemed to be a bit easy, got through it in about an hour.  Although interesting enough to want to continue.  Can't wait for more levels!
B00D6BU8GG|3.0|This one must have been millimeters away from releasing direct to DVD. Absent the spectacularly staged automotive mayhem scenes, the weak storyline and tired dialogs quickly sink this movie to the realm of the mediocre. Watch it if you are bored staring at the back of the airline seat in front of you. Anyother place, you should be getting paid to watch this.
B005NKIQ26|5.0|The product was way better than what I was expecting. The description said that the cd was used, but it was not, it was a brand new cd with a little crack in the box!!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Just discovered this TV show. I love the premise and enjoy the character dynamics especially between Mike and Harvey and Mike and Rachel.
1885167776|4.0|What i learned from this book:<br /><br />Entrepreneurs do what comes naturally, but to be great you have to do what comes unnaturally.<br />Discipline is just a habit learned over time.<br />Willpower is limited so use it wisely.<br />To discover your one thing, you have to be driven by purpose first, priority second, productivity third and profit is fourth.<br />Leading a balanced life is ridiculous.  You want to lead a counterbalanced life with half your energy going into your purpose.<br />No one succeeds alone.<br />Going by the 10,000 hours to mastery, you need to spend 4 hours a day on your ONE THING.<br />Multi-tasking is a myth.  It chips away at willpower and focus and leads to poor workmanship.<br /><br />To discover your purpose, or ONE THING, ask yourself \\"What is the one thing I can do today that will make everything else easier or unnecessary?
B007FY9ZWI|3.0|Um ixwas listening to one singni previously got then my other song just cut it off .then another time I was listening and I heard weird scratching screeching noises while I listened.but all in all I love it
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game kept me thinking and searching. I really liked thinking it through and for the most part I usually could figure it out in one sitting, but some I had to think it through a bit more.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|When I picked up the first book of the series, I thought &#34;I will never make it through all of these books.&#34; Now here I am on Book Five and cannot put it down.  This series just keeps me glued to the books.  It has made me laugh, it has shocked me so many times, I think about it when I am not reading it as well.  I highly recommend this series.  A great summer read!  mzim
B0047SKR54|4.0|So I really liked this movie, but it ask a lot of abstract questions that you have to be ready to think about if you really want to understand the movie.
0802473156|4.0|I heard about this book from a family member and I was hesitant to buy it at first! When I finally decided to read the book, I was very intrigued by the way the author describes the 5 Love Languages. Everyone loves differently...we've always known that. But the author manages to simplify the different ways we love in a way that allows for us to better understand how to be there for one another and support each other by giving that person exactly what they need. I really enjoyed this book and I find myself analyzing my family members and friends so that I can decipher how they love and the best way for me to give them that love. I highly recommend this book for people trying to get a better understanding on the way people accept and give love as well as those trying to grasp the meaning of \\"love languages.\\"
B0035LJY6C|5.0|Love, love, love this movie.  Raul Julia and Angelica Huston are the best Gomez and Morticia.  The rest of the cast is also amazing and the story is just perfect.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Love, love, loved this book, I couldn't put it down!  Well written - I felt what the character was feeling.  You'll never look at flowers the same way again.  Book club pick for sure!
B00B9HEAVS|5.0|I've listened to this album over and over again. Every song has a beat that gets you right into having fun. The last song, \\"Club Rocker,\\" is the only one I could have done without, but it still wasn't a bad song. The album was totally worth importing it.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|If one watches this series I believe you will be hooked.  Tells of the political world and the inner workings of how things get done....
B003H4I4JU|5.0|This was a good book when I read it years ago and it's just as good when I read it again.
B00CI5ET7K|5.0|I like the progressive rock style of this album and enjoyed all the songs. Fans of joes older music might be put off a little by it not  being as hard edged as earlier works but I think it will grow on them.

B0015DWJ8W|5.0|I have many common sense in this book.<br />What I feel the same the most is<br />It is easy to find some reasons to quit but it is important to find why you have to run.<br />I always think about it.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|If you like a beautiful storyline, nice graphics and soothing music while you solve interesting, container block style puzzles...you will really like this one.<br />You can play at your own speed, or try to be quickly perfect, and/or collect all the gems...  It's a good game!!!
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|I wanted to be excited about it, but I just couldn't. It felt like I NEEDED to watch it, but I just couldn't muster up all the excitement that is supposed to be Lincoln.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun and challenging. Keeps your brain working which is always a good thing. I really enjoy this game. That's all I have to say
B0014D6PCO|5.0|I am catching up on the series and thought I would rent it on the cheap to watch via HDMI on television.  Streaming was good.  No issues!
B0055D3EFU|4.0|Liked it so much that it scared me. It was very scary...seems like it is something that ca really happen
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|The imagery was amazing! This is a great story. I wish I would have read the book. A good family movie.
B0087JTAKW|2.0|The book was very boring for the first 3/4 and then it finally became interesting. I would not recommend this to anyone even though I have loved all Mitch Albom books before this one.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|this game is not easy and will keep you trying again and again. It's nice to have a game that isn't so easily won or completed.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun and challeging game once u get into 10 levels or so.  I dont like how they make you rate the app to keep it.
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|I love the Die Hard series.  I own all of the movies in the series.  This one is just a lot of fun.  Some of the stunts are a bit fantastical, but then, this is a movie, and it is Die Hard.  I really enjoyed watching this movie.  If you have enjoyed the series, or even if you just enjoy a good action flic, I would recommend this movie.  Lots of action, and this movie is actually fun to watch.
B000FA675C|5.0|I have wanted to read this book ever since it first came out, and I finally got to it.  I'm so glad I did.  It has opened my eyes to a new perspective and the storyline is terrific.
B001NLL93W|5.0|From the moment I first started the series I was wanting more. I can't get enough of it, it is so mesmerizing for your mind to create the images of what  the author is describing to you.
B000OJFV4C|2.0|I'm trying to figure out what Showtime and the writers of The Tudors were thinking. The Tudors wasn't about one man and his wives. And in fact, the story of how Henry VIII's father got to the throne was pretty amazing in and of itself and probably should have been told to explain Buckingham's plot and claims.<br /><br />This should have been called &#34;Henry&#34; not &#34;The Tudors&#34; the name is both misleading and erroneous. As is the entirety of this show.<br /><br />From what I can tell, they got the names of the main characters right (some of them any way), and that's about it. I can see why they won (or were nominated for) an Oscar for costume design and not for the show itself. So much of the acting (especially that of Henry's) is forced, contrived, and more in league with a daytime soap opera; though at times I feel it's insulting the soap opera actors to say that.<br /><br />There's creative license (think The Other Boleyn Girl) and there's nonsense. THIS is nonsense. And as with any nonsense, contrived nudity and sex is used to mask the fact that the writing is subpar and the acting by the main characters (Henry, Thomas Boleyn and Anne), are at times, atrocious.<br /><br />The real reason for the enmity between Anne and Wolsey was never even brushed on. No mention at all about Mary's 1st pregnancy and that her son was more than likely Henry's child. Two really big incidents to miss in the retelling of this story.<br /><br />Making Henry a short brunette, is like making Elizabeth a big-busted blonde. Why couldn't they even get that right? Henry VIII was tall, redheaded, athletic, larger than life, and they chose the smallest, shortest, darkest-haired actor they could find to portray him. Would hair dye really been asking too much? Since apparently an actor who can actually act was.<br /><br />Henry Cavill did the best he could with what was written, and did well enough that I watched, oftentimes wishing the roles were changed so that Cavill could play Henry Tudor instead. Sam Neill and Jeremy Northam did fantastic portrayals of Wolsey and More, and Cromwell was as evil and disliked (though there were times I really did like and feel for him) as I could have hoped for. Cranmer was a tad too sniveling for what the real Cranmer would have been.<br /><br />For those who don't know, Henry had 2 sisters, not one, and Margaret never killed any of her husbands. Princess Mary Tudor was the one who married Charles Brandon, and neither sister were ever married to anyone in Portugal. I don't even know why they would have done that in the show. Did the writers have something against Portugal? When Mary's husband (in France died) Brandon was sent to bring her back to England; he married her. This was treason and Wolsey campaigned on Brandon's behalf NOT to have him executed, so I'm not even sure why the show would have them disliking each other.<br /><br />Wolsey never committed suicide, and Cromwell actually had deep affection and respect for Wolsey. He'd championed for Wolsey even when he fell out of favor with the king.<br /><br />From all accounts, when Queen Katherine died, Henry and Anne celebrated her death. May be coincidental, but right after she died they had a party and wore yellow. That was not a man (or couple) in mourning. He wasn't lying on the floor bawling. Just as he celebrated Anne's demise with a wedding, he celebrated Katherine's death with a party. I really don't think the real Henry was as loving or crazy as people make him out to be. He was simply unfeeling with no sense of decorum.<br /><br />When I had nothing better to do, and nothing else to watch on a Sunday night, this show was enough to pass the time, bad acting aside. If you don't care anything about actual history then you may find it more entertaining than I did. All I wanted to do was hunt down the writers and smack the crap out of them. Then I wanted to hunt down the casting agents to see who bribed them off. Sometimes great costumes just aren't enough. And even with the better acting by the supporting cast than the main cast it just wasn't enough to make this a must see by any stretch of the imagination.<br /><br />All smoke, no fire. Two stars.
B005IQZB14|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read. Cheryl, you have touched me deeply. No, I am not a 20 something woman trying to make sense of my life. I am a 70 something grandfather who is still trying to figure it out.  Keep writing.
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|Kept comparing to the show Castle, will get use to the fact that it does not follow the show story line and read more
0756407915|2.0|I really enjoyed Name of the Wind; I thought the premise was unique and interesting and the mystique surrounding Kvothe and his history really had me wanting to know how this guy ended up as a bar tender in a tiny town. I liked Rothfuss' story telling style and I was very excited to read the second one, which is what makes the Wise Man's Fear so disappointing. I will admit right now that I did not finish the book, I got to page 500 (of 994) and couldn't go on. It's not that I mind long books, I flew through the first one, it's that in those 500 pages virtually nothing of significance happens. This is a trilogy about a legendary swordsman and (spoiler alert)at half way through the second book our hero has yet to even pick up a sword, let alone do anything legendary with one! I didn't mind the stories of Kvothe at the University in Name of the Wind (even though it was kinda Harry Potter-esque, and I'm not a fan of those books)but, in my opinion, Rothfuss spends WAY too much time focusing on Kvothe's time there. Now granted, I don't know where the plot of the trilogy is going but it seems to me that the books are meant to be about more than just a kid at a school. Rothfuss spends long, drawn out, chapters talking about Kvothe playing music or reading in a library, and the whole time I'm waiting for Kvothe to leave the school so he can start doing heroic things. So when I was a third of the way into the book and (spoiler alert) Kvothe was still at the school I started getting frustrated. Then when he finally does leave Rothfuss glosses over what could have been the most exciting point of the story so far. Kvothe tells Chronicler about how his ship was attacked by pirates and how he escaped with his life and was shipwrecked and then find a way back to land, and he did all this in the span of half a page! This is where the book lost me; Rothfuss spent pages and pages and PAGES detailing Kvothe's activities at the University, he even spent a whole chapter on Kvothe and hisfriends lying under the stars telling stories, but when the book comes to a point of actual action and excitment he gives it the briefest of mentions and moves on. I read on for a little while after that but quickly lost interest as the story continued into more drawn out dialoague and no discernable plot movement. For the sake of those who will read the whole book I hope it picks up in the last half, and I hope Rothfuss is planning to step it up a notch with the third book, which I haven't yet decided if I'll read.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|Loved the books will read more of the series.  I get the people confused with the show Castle but will get over it.
B004LQEYAG|5.0|Very entertaining, especially the special features (history behind the making of the film).  This replaced what I had copied off TV.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|I looked at the video when it first came out and I had to get it so when I bought it I looked at all of the guns and fired them. Really realistic graphics especially the M1919 Browning and the ammo belt simulation, I thought that was the best part! Totally worth the dollar spent and I would recommend this to anyone! Well done!
B008BDZP3K|5.0|this was always one of my favorite  frank zappa albums in high school. it still is. easy listening jazzrock fusion and a beefheart song , you can't go wrong. this is a good starter album for people who were wary of his &#34;comedy&#34; music. it won't piss off your wife. Check out the Zappanale Music fest in Bad Doberan,Germany. it's put on every year in August by the ARF society, for you die hard fans,(google it/you tube) you will be among your fellow mothers' brothers over there.

B00992CF6W|3.0|it is ok because their should be more blocks in fact their should be just as many blocks as the computer version.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|Great classic movie....how u doing!<br />Watched this movie over 100 times!<br />Well directed and still can't be beat!<br />Robert deniro is the best and really makes this movie come to life. Based off a true story this movie is my life.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|wish you had the whole season available, instead of just teasing us with the first part.  I am not going to pay to see the following episodes.
B00821OX98|5.0|Keeps you on the end of your seat.  Great cast.  Can't wait to start the next season.  don't miss this series.
B002VWNIDG|1.0|I can't believe the horrible acting in this movie. Especially that of Shelley Duvall, who plays Jack Nicholson's wife in the movie. Really awful for a Stephen King story.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|I think the reason that I liked it so well was I went in with no expectations. Its a children's title but obviously adults will love it. ever since matrix came out everybody's been doing it but it really seems to work here. I had a great time while I was thereit took me away to another place I thoroughly enjoyed it and that's why I give it 5 stars I'm pretty critical and normally don't even Rate movies but I just loved this one
B001L62REY|5.0|This is a film cast during the American Revolution that mixes romance and action. The players are the French, English and the<br />revolutionists who obtain aid from Indian scouts. The film is a gripping tale of the British attempt to fortify their position in the new world set against the backdrop of romance between an Indian scout and the daughter of  a British officer in charge of a besieged<br />fort. The conflict between Indian nations adds to a climactic ending.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This is the best game ever. You can take care of your animals. I love horses and it has peguses.If you mix a hawk and a horse you will get a peguses.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Could not put it down, even if I wanted.<br />It launched into action from the first page and kept the pace up all through to the end. Almost exhaustive to read.<br /><br />Felt kinda strange to finish the series. No more Rand, Mat, Perrin and the rest of the gang....
B00CWY76CC|5.0|LOVE IT...this game is soooooo fun. The graphics are awesome. I finished it with in an hour of downloading it. You should get it now!!!!!!!!!
B0093Q8W0C|5.0|This was a great movie. I streamed it using the PS3 with excellent picture quality. The movie was classic Hitchcock before he began making the much more intense thrillers. Lots of humorous lines played by Cary Grant while still having that edge that can make you breathless. I loved the twists.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|Great fast read enjoy the characters.  Pacing is good, some good humor.  Good urban fantasy.<br />Has the pace of a Dan Brown novel.
B002W7J3SO|5.0|I've only seen it a dozen times and I still like it.  It is a classic must see before you die movie.
B0095P3ULC|3.0|Numbers one and two were better. Sometimes it's best to leave well enough alone. More gadgets, more explosives, Patrick Dempsey and a little sex can't save a weak plot.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I enjoyed the FEVER series even more the second time around.  MacKayla and Barrons are the sexiest, most powerful couple I've ever had the pleasure to get to know.  I love the setup for the continuation of Dani's story and can't wait to revisit Iced.
B00CATSONE|3.0|There is something missing from this biography.  It feels more like a high school term paper with tidbits of information and an underlying persuasive essay convincing us that imagination is what truly defines intelligence. And the author doesn't necessarily prove the point, that imagination is the key to intelligence but gives a 'and this is why imagination is so important' type thesis.<br />I don't give a darn about trying to talk about imagination.  I wanted to hear why this so unheard of man is 'the inventor of the 20th century' and the content of the book didn't prove this epic statement.<br />I'm sure it's true about Tesla, that he invented the 20th century, but this book didn't convince me.  After reading the book, I went on the internet and found out much more interesting information about Tesla.  This book felt like a mini-pamphlet introduction to Tesla.  And maybe that was its author's intent, but to me, it fell very short of feeling as epic as its title.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|I try to install on my kindle and it doesnt but something is on here but I cant find it. when I go find it in the app store. it tells me to install. so now I have to go though the data and find it to delete it so I can have more room.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|Things don't work when you are off-line. You have to pay extra for fonts that for the price should be there. Suddenly, a huge number of documents land up in your documents file! Too many for you to have time to delete. For the price, I feel it is too demanding.
B00C1S945G|5.0|It was still finding it's way in season 2 but it showed constant improvement with character development and great storylines.  One of my favorite shows.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I feel this Ap has everything you'd want in a timer and alarm clock. Good choice of wake up calls and sounds. Good graphics. A fun thing to have.
B004SEUJ82|5.0|I bought this movie to show to my middle school students after we finished a book unit on a World War II novel. This movie is a remarkable one, very poignant, but with an unusual twist. It was good for the students to be able to relate to the young boys. I will show this movie every year and have recommended it to non-teacher friends and family.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Very well organised and fulfils what I need from the Ap. It gives you all the information where you want it.<br />I recommend it. Christopher
B0046RE5I6|3.0|I decided to read this having heard an episode on the radio and knew that I wouldn't be able to catch the rest of the series. The story seemed intriguing and I wanted to know what happened - unfortunately I found the style of the writing a little too simplistic. There was a bit too much 'he said...' then 'she said...' will little variety or detail. The plot device to unmask the real culprit was all too familiar from the Poirot and Miss Marple stories on TV. Perhaps I've read too many bloody and violent crime thrillers to appreciate Agatha?
B00C061I3K|3.0|Look, its a good album with a few good songs, but it'll never be as good as Discovery or even their Alive 2007 performance.
B0074VTHKM|2.0|Theodore Boone is a book for youth readers.  The story is written with that is mind.  Good for 6th to 9th graders.
B009MF56GC|5.0|I enjoyed it, with all of its raw violence and the collection of so many 80s and 90s action film actors, but i still find the directors cut of the first film to be better.
B005USZYDU|2.0|Theodore Boone is written for the youth of about his same age.  Well written and has it's surprises to keep you turning the pages.
B007R108WA|3.0|The storyline was alright, but it was one of those films that I would not mind doing something else while watching it since it does not have much suspense and it was quite predictable.
B00BSWMITK|5.0|I thought, I would give it a try, and I was not sissapointed. It showed up on time, and plays well in the car.
B00BV2M9LO|4.0|I always look forward to a new Michael Crichton book and thought this one sounded like it had a good premise for its story.  It is unfortunate that he died before completing it since I think the final result would have been different had he been able to complete it.  The story still seems to have some rough edges and the flow of the story can be very slow at places particularly in the beginning.<br /><br />That being said, I still think this was a good book, just not a great one like some of his previous ones were.  I mean no disrespect to Richard Preston.  I have read some of his previous work and it is quite good.  He had the unenviable task of taking over someone else's book and had to complete it without changing it too much.  A hard job no matter what you do.<br /><br />This is a story about how the main characters view of the world changes when they are shrunk down to a half-inch size and then lost is a lush forest area in Hawaii.  How they respond to this world is quite entertaining as they all have very different views of the world to start with and are forced to work together to try to survive.<br /><br />My advice to anyone wanting to read the book is to hang in there through the first part of the book.  When the second section of the book starts, the story begins to pickup and have more of a flow.  There are still some disjointed changes of perspective which do not come across well, but the storyline starts to come together at this point.  I think that  a lot more depth could have been found in some parts of the story as well as the background information given to reflect the strange world they were encountering.  If nothing else, it will give the reader a new viewpoint of all the insects and birds around them.
B00C0UHGLO|1.0|I have played this game as a board game at parties, and love the strategy involved.<br />I was elated to see it in electronic format and available for my android, but was disappointed to see the comments regarding the tracking and permissions the game requires.  I have to agree, there's no need for approximate location permissions, and there's definitely no need for precise location permissions, hence the loss of two stars.  With that said, I usually turn off data and wifi when I'm playing, and I never have GPS on unless I'm using it for mobility purposes so I don't have too much of an issue with these permission requirements yet.  When I find out if they're taking my precise location without my direct involvement, it'll be uninstalled pretty quick.<br /><br />The game is well designed, and functions very nicely.  There are however, limited settings of just sound and music, and there is no dual player over Bluetooth or wifi so one must continually pass the tablet or phone back and forth, increasing the possibility of the unit being dropped.  I like the idea of the two player game, but would like to see an option for Bluetooth connectivity.<br />I like playing against both an AI or another player, plus the idea of several levels of progression, but I have yet to figure out how to advance to those other progressive levels.  I play for the strategy and enjoyment of fighting for the tactical advantage.<br /><br />Abalone is an excellent game for those who enjoy playing chess.  If one does not enjoy chess or does not like strategy games in general, they will be disappointed in this game.<br /><br />[UPDATE] ...<br />There came along an update which changed/added a permission.  This permission checks/keeps track of your accounts on your phone/tablet. What is the purpose of checking accounts for a game? Are there charges involved with this game? I don't play online money-charging games, so I don't know the ramifications of these permissions to the game itself. I'm feelingmore and more leery of this app and am uninstalling. I don't believe the acceptance of these permissions is worth the potential risks involved. Downgraded to one star because the graphics and gameplay itself is still of good quality.
0470876417|4.0|Very interesting book for entrepreneurs wishing to succeed.  I also recomend for people involved in helping people to set up a new business.
B00AVTMB4I|4.0|There's a lot life in this film.  Solid across the board.  I liked the story, direction, and acting.  Rent this film.
B006VFLIYK|3.0|I have read several David Baldacci books and think he is a good author.  This book was well written but I found it a bit boring to get through.  The plot was predictable and got rather repetitive and drawn out. I still enjoyed the book enough to finish it but wish it had a few more unique twists and turns to hold my attention.  A good simple read for travel or summer vacation.
B001OMJGD0|4.0|Found it alittle late after seeing man of steal and decided that I like this style of Superman rather then the new (man of Steel)one
0062262947|5.0|I have listened to the sigma force novels with Peter Jay Fernandez as the narrator.  I identify the characters with the narrator's voice.  When you change a narrator in the middle of a series it becomes hard to listen to.  How would you feel that if every time you listened to your parents or a close friend speak their voices changed?  When you have something good and it works well don't change it.  The non-reader audience is growing.  Set some standards and be consistent.  The author says the he does not choose the narrator, the audio book company does.  If that is true why does clive cussler have scott brick read ALL of his novels????  If you are unhappy with the audio version of THE EYE OF GOD return it and get your money back.  maybe that will send a message to the recording company to be more consistent with the narrators.  It is interesting to see that everyone who read the Eye Of God gives it a 5 star but those that listened to it  gave a poor rating.  I believe that in the future there will be many more people listening to books rather than reading them.  tom
B00C9PQ7I8|4.0|One of the high points of recent years for those with a love for \\"real music\\" was the pairing together of veteran blues/gospel singer Mavis Staples who enlisted Wilco's Jeff Tweedy, a fellow native of Chicago to produce the Grammy-winning \\"You Are Not Alone\\". This was one of the finest albums of that or any year and Staples blues take on the double pairing of \\"Too Close To Heaven/I'm On My Way To Heaven Anyhow\\" was so deep it was almost primal. What great news then to see the two re-unitied and producing what is for all intents and purposes a follow up but with an even stronger gospel base. Staples is now well into her seventies and her voice remains an instrument which undoubtedly has the firm backing of the Lord providing its divine inspiration. It is by no means perfect, sometimes falters and there is the odd blemish but all this adds to its raw power rather than detracts from it. The mood of the album is subdued but infused with raw emotion. Tweedy's production assists this by stripping back the arrangements almost to bare boned acoustics. It is not completely susprising bearing in mind his own recent production duties with slow core masters Low, that Tweedy starts off Staples with a cover of one of their most recent songs the ethereal country of \\"Holy Ghost\\". The pattern of this song devised by Duluth's most famous band works perfectly for Staples voice and it is a brilliant start. Even better is the menace that Tweedy introduces into the old spiritual \\"Every step of the way\\" and that voice infuses it with an emotion that most singers strive for but never achieve. Much more surprising is the sprightly take on Funkadelic's \\"Can You Get to That\\" which does on initial hearings appear slighty out of place but eventually fits the album like a glove.<br /><br />Mavis Staples voice can range from a churchy low register to an hurricane which could tear the roof off. This album tends to play to the former element in more restrained acoustics of songs like \\"Jesus Wept\\" and the lovely slow funk of an album highlight the cover of Nick Lowe's \\"Far Celestial shores\\" which has Tweedy's musical stamp all over it. The more traditional gospel songs here also work brilliantly not least \\"What are they doing in heaven today\\" and another song associated with Doc McKenzie and the Hi Lites \\"Sow Good Seeds\\". Perhaps if there is one slip on the album its the rather standard version of \\"I like the things about me\\", but Staples is to much of a great artist to sustain a prolonged slip. The final two songs on the album comprise a great acoustic guitar driven \\"I woke up this morning (with my mind on Jesus) \\" that shuffles along beautifully and finally the albums title track brings it all to conclusion with a fitting showcase of deep slow blues which should really see a statute erected in Washington DC to this great singer while she is still alive to tell her how much she really means to us all.<br /><br />It is rumoured that Staples is working on her memoirs and she has a treasure torve of stories and inspiration to share. She recently talked of her love for Dr Martin Luther King and stated on the wider musical front \\"that I feel so honoured that I have worked with Curtis Mayfield, Bob Dylan, the greatest poets in the world. So I've had just a wonderful, wonderful life. If I leave here tomorrow, I have nothing to ask for, I have left with everything done that I wanted\\". This is a fine reflection but we must hope that there remains a good few years left in the tank of this remarkable singer because any one who makes music this good over such a long time deserves a few more decades to come.nd the lovely slow funk of an album highlight the cover of Nick Lowe's \\"Far Celestial shores\\" which has Tweedy's musical stamp all over it.

B00BQ1D7X4|4.0|That being said, there is such a thing as too much. Their new singer is being held back on this album. Too much harmonizing, and not enough of his voice. Black Gives way to Blue was an excellent album, and I don't think this one quite stands up to it. This is a good album, just not as good as Black Gives Way to Blue.
B005LAIH2C|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. Gemma A. what a beauty. Very good actress. Jeremy R. career, very versatile. The two had good chemistry. Action moved along at a good pace. Love the twist and sensuality of the movie fairy tale.  A fairly good movie to see and enjoy. I wouldn't recommend it for the youngsters. Great Price.
B008XG1X18|5.0|pinterest is awesome u can get followers follow ppl make new boards and post pins!!!  :D u should get this app!!!
B00DC7NNAC|1.0|This movie was so bad it doesn't even deserve a review!  Save your money and run far away from this abomination!
B004LLDN3A|4.0|I had. My daughter watch it and she enjoyed it as much as I did when I was her age .
B00AFROVQC|4.0|Awesome read, very gripping from start to finish. Only thing that was a problem was punctuation towards the end but that's not a big deal at all.
0440237688|5.0|How did I miss this book before now? It is a bit slow to start but I think that is because of the intended audience - it is well written and a great story. It seems the best books I read these days are intended for children - Harry Potter, Hunger Games, His Dark Materials. The audiobook version is very well done, the narrator does a great job.
B009MYARIK|2.0|Sophie Kinsella is definitely grasping at straws.  She used to write clever, funny books that I could relate to.  Now I feel like either I've outgrown Ms. Kinsella, or the quality of the writing has deteriorated in an effort to publish more books.  Either way, disappointing.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I needed to upgrade my VHS collection of Star Trek movies to DVD. This was the perfect choice! Got all 6 movies for a good price.
B00CLVEPFC|5.0|I know this digital version came out a mere week before the dvd, but I couldn't wait that long to see it again!  Love this version of the fairy tale!
B00382S9SC|5.0|Love this show!!! So many people mistake the show as nothing more than a sex show. But is so much more than that. It's about the most veritable friendships one will ever see. Their friendship and commitment to each other overshadows the sex. They're always there for each other. They judge each other relentlessly but it never discounts the love that they share. What more could a woman in today's world ask for?
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is awesome! I want more games like this. Would I buy it for UNLIMITED levels!? Hell Yes! Keep them coming!!
0307341577|4.0|Dark Places was a great read.  I find Gillian Flynns books hard to put down.  I like her statement that her husband knows what goes on in her mind and still sleeps with her with the lights off.
B003GK21YE|4.0|Good build up that became too obvious,Ending far fetched and beyond reality.Characters crumbled towards the end.A good read for a Follett fan.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|One of the most extensive World War II documentaries I've seen. Plenty of exciting footage and knowledge to go along with it.
B00BMTX2QM|5.0|Classic, breathtakingly baleful. Make haste, the albatross wants you to spin the worth. panhandling the wicked trust mechanism. SO when
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|It is easy and fun to play.  My grandson and I both liked it a lot.  Good for small children.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is excellent if you ever are bored. I can't wait until the house of Hades comes out in stores
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I love the duels of the planeswalkers games. This is no different. Some of the art in the game is absolutely gorgeous.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|This movie is really action packed, funny, and awesome. If there are any Transformer fans out there like me I recommend Transformers 3 and the others one to like the second one and the first.<br /> I have been on facebook and I follow Moviepass I found out that they are making a squeal to the Transformers movies and its coming out June 29th next year.<br /> Hey anybody would love this movie and I recommend it to anyone for renting or buying its really good.<br /> Just let me know what you thought of my review and if you got it and watched it tell me what you thought of it that would be awesome! :)<br /><br />AUTOBOTS TRANSFORM AND ROLL OUT!!!!!!!!!! :)
B0044KBQLE|5.0|One of the best episodes ever.  It's funny and serious at the same time.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.
159463176X|5.0|I just finished the second to last chapter of this amazing book in tears: thinking about my own aging father from whom I have been estranged most of my life; thinking about my own inevitable death one day. Hosseini's wisdom, coupled with his exquisite writing style, has moved me as few other books have. His characters are so completely drawn that you feel their heartache and their joy as if they were your own. He captures and nails humanity in all its complexity.<br />I don't want the book to end, yet I am anxious to see how he completes the telling of this remarkable tale. This may be, yes, I think it is, my very favorite book to date. I am a writer myself, yet I have no critique. If the last chapter follows the quality of the previous, it will be, in my opinion, a perfect book.
B005PK57NU|5.0|The Good wife is a really good show, especially if you're considering becoming a lawyer. It has a bit of law and drama mixed
B00992CF6W|5.0|Grandson LOVES it! I downloaded to a tablet with an Android system - it doesn't have all the features of the game for a computer.  I would play if i had the chance.
B007RCJNDE|4.0|It did not have a very good ending. Alot of questions left open and it should have been written better with more closure for all fans
B00908DDZM|5.0|I purchased this because of &#34;Thrift Shop&#34; but I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed the entire album.  The lyrics actually have a meaning other than just for the sake of entertainment.  This is something that has been missing from Hip-Hop for two decades.
B000I3PERS|5.0|One of my favorite movies that I have to watch at least once a year.  Only thing that could have been better is if Mel Gibson would have had a beard in the film.
B00CLZ48FA|4.0|The story line was great and I love how it perfectly ties ends where &#34;The Wizard of Oz&#34; begins.  However, I expected better graphics from a Disney movie.
B00CFQN12Q|4.0|My taste in movies is probably terrible but I can't ever get enough of the Die Hard movies.  It's definitely not the best in the series but it's still got my favorite action hero, John McClane, in it. I'm of the belief that John McClane being in any movie makes it much more enjoyable.  It probably gets hard to come up with ideas for how a New York City cop can save the world.  If they do make a 6th, I hope it has a better story but none the less always enjoyable seeing Bruce Willis and John McClane on the screen.
B00003CX9W|5.0|Perfect condition and a fair price plus fast shipping.  I bought this because my grandchildren loved it when they were little and I now have a great-granddaughter and another grandson.  It's an excellent way to introduce little ones to classical music.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved it. Really addicting. Cant wait for more levels. I just couldnt stop playing.  Not bad for a free game
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Got it for my 9 year old to teach chess.  Works great.  Kid will not stop playing!  Would buy again.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|These are adorable!  Took just minutes to put up on the wall. My little granddaughter is over the moon! She loves to take nap surrounded by all her Princess friends. Tons of decals to pick from and lots of ways to arrange them. I would highly recommend these for any child's room.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is very convenient and easy to use. My kindle did not have a calculator and this app has come in handy, definitely recommend it.
B001QC6QRC|5.0|Extremely well made movie. Amazing when I was 5 and still amazing today. Would recommend this movie to anyone that has appreciation for the Turtles! Cowahbunga!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This helps so much with my work schedule for 40 people. Counting hours on a small calculator sucks and the big numbers help so I don't mess up the addition
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|The package arrived on time and as promised. This is my first gaming mouse so I really don't have a good reference to judge this product. The only reason I gave 4 stars and not 5 is because this didn't come with it's software. I had to download it. Normally not a problem but I had just moved and my mouse came 3 days before my net was installed so I had to wait to use it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Adult youth. Highly recommend. Author keeps you spellbound. The entire series is well written and a worthwhile read. Pass it on!
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a challenging and fun game.  There are different levels but I have only played the first so far.  It takes me 15 minutes or more to solve this.  When I can solve it faster, I will move to next level.
B009PAETCG|5.0|This app is really fun. I love soccer so much I have all kinds if different soccer games but this one is my favorite :)
B005ILWOZA|5.0|Just listened to this on a car trip and loved it. Of course I Love anything James Morrison sings but this album was great!  Liked all of the songs on it. Thrilled I bought it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent character development and loads of English suspense mixed with just the right amount of \\"so much dither.\\"  No doubt Season 4 will draw more fans.
0307744434|5.0|Wow...what can I honestly say, but wow!  The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern is absolutely spellbinding.  Talk about creating a whole new world...Morgenstern created a whole new universe and makes it dance and sparkle!  I absolutely adore this novel and the characters created within the pages.  What a richly woven story that plays out so vividly in my mind.  The scenes are so wonderfully and masterfully painted within the words of these pages that my imagination goes into overdrive.  This is one book that I will never forget.<br /><br />If twists of fate, epic challenges, strategic maneuvering, enduring love, and magic intrigue you then this is the book for you!  Be prepared enter into a world that will capture you and have you holding onto the edge of your seat until the very end!  Morgenstern is enchanting and The Night Circus is pure magic that will be enjoyed on those rainy nights, a low key weekend or even in your summer beach bag!<br /><br />As a side note, in honor of Audiobook month, let me also highly recommend the audio version of The Night Circus!  One of my all-time favorite Jim Dale, narrates this masterpiece and brings a new life to the story with his excellent narration, pace and characters.  An audiobook to enjoy over and over again!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am totally not into books like this but because of the popularity I gave it a shot and was so happy I did. Great book i recommend it!
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|Now... It tells me I need an update and there is none... Now I cant play.... fix it please I play every day!
B00992CF6W|5.0|its not as good as xbox or Pc but it is still awesome it nears to be updated so its like the xbox or Pc.
B009YP9L7U|1.0|It was not my cup of tea. I didn't like the way the author writes. The whole story was stupid and didn't see how you could write<br />a story around such a concept. So sorry I bought it. In fact, I never did finish the book.
1577314808|5.0|This is one of those books that you enjoy so much, you just feel compelled to share the knowledge learned from it. With that being said; I bought a book for all my closest friends and gave them out as Christmas gifts to many of my family members. I find that I can go back to it, time and time again and I will not bore from it.... You need to buy this book, if you have a hard time slowing down and feel burdened by nostalgia of the mind.... :)
B000LB7G00|5.0|I work as a manufacturing engineer, and I'm on CAD programs nearly all day. I've used this mouse at work for 6 months now, and I cannot imagine using any 3D modelling application with out it. At first it was very weird to get used to, but as you become acclimated to it, it's an invaluable aid. I highly recommend doing the 3D puzzle that comes with the software often until you get the hang of the controls; it's a simple and fun way to practice. Once the controls become second nature, it's hard to remember how you ever got along without using one.<br /><br />Very well designed product. The software allows you to easily adjust the sensitivity, and map the two side keys to whatever you want, with application specific support and multiple available profiles, and the weighted base and rubber feet keep it from moving while you're using the mouse. I can't think of a single bad thing to say about it, though I would highly reccommend this product over the notebook counterpart, which is smaller, and much easier to lift.<br /><br />Now that I've used this 3D mouse, I am never going back to just using a conventional mouse. These 3dconnexion mice make it so much easier to move parts around in 3D modelling software, and I've just purchased one for myself to use at home, because I really can't do without it.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|The puzzles truly live up to the first two games, and the soundtrack succeeds at setting the atmosphere, just as in the first two games. I heavily reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys good puzzles and amazing music.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|Interesting plot and perfect casting.  Scenery surely filmed on location as it was worth watching again just to look at the background.
B00CVCG87O|4.0|Altered State brings an unusual taste of today's rock. TesseracT creates a spacious-like timbre unlike from what i have heard. While some songs sound harsh with thier \\"metal-based\\" measures due to the fact the bass does sounds like it has metal string tone, there are songs like Nocturne, thier hit single out of 2, that gives a nice lullaby tone while still keeping rock elements in play. In short, if your interested into easy listening but still want some nice hard rock, Altered State provides what you desire to hear.
B005898CFI|5.0|Hatari is one of my favorite Movies, and I can watch this movie every day, Hatari is a great Family Movie.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This games is relaxing and fun. I love it so much that I play it everyday. My cousin also plays it when hes bored. My cousin and I love diamond dash so much we play it together. GO DIAMOND DASH.
B00BQPEIT2|3.0|I would like to say that it's a good game all together. The path is not as distinct as the original Temple Run, the graphics are a bit disappointing, and I found it more difficult. If you want a Temple Run game get Temple Run 2 for free. It's a lot more fun and has better graphics and upgrades.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I dont care what all the other people say about the glitch that deletes  every thing it is awesome. I have the double rainbow and havnt spent one penny or more on this app. It is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo awesooooooooooooooooooooooooome.

B0057ZAA0S|5.0|photografia, filosofia, trama, actuaciones, esta pelicula lo tiene todo. robert carlyle esta magnifico, al igual que los demas actores. la recomiendo ampliamente, y la edicion blue ray tiene una nitidez impactante.
B00DCXAESU|5.0|All I can say is, wow. I've probably played this album like 10 times in the past week it's so good! The vinyls arrived here in perfect condition and on time. I couldn't be happier with this purchase!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is fun! It's challenging, but not to the point of being frustrated. It's a great way to pass the time.

B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I love the game it is so much fun u can drive, crash and race against each other the game is a number #1
B00CWY76CC|4.0|it keeps you enertained.If you have kids that fight all the time get this app and they'll have to work together.
1574214276|4.0|I would have liked some more complex patterns and designs. More challenge is needed. But it's a great book for beginners!
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|This app is great. I reccomend this to anyone whose looking for a simply and  easy alarm clock. This app us free and you don't need Wi-Fi in order to use it which is another bonus.
B002KGEORM|5.0|I cannot get enough of the Sons of Anarchy! The characters feel &#34;real&#34; to me; their love for &#34;family&#34; is heartfelt and sometimes intense. It's interesting how much in common some of the law enforcement agencies and local politicians have in common with the &#34;Harley enthusiasts&#34;.
0425263924|4.0|As true to her her style we pick up where we left off with Eva and Gideon but Gideon has lost his bad ass attitude. He appears softer and more loving. He isn't himself. Still a good read just not the page turner I found the others to be.
B008Y7BE7E|4.0|This was a fun movie. This crazy concept coupled with good approach and good acting.  I think you will like it.
B009ZFPQOQ|5.0|What a great App.  Makes my Garmin look sad. The traffic and weather updates make driving a pleasure. I don't know how i lived without it.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|I don't like the fact that I need to have 2 amazon apps to buy things. I have some credits to buy songs and wanted to buy something fast but it asks for my credit card info, which amazon already has.  I don't like having to put my credit card in 2 different apps.
0345803493|5.0|very erotic romance novel.  Easy to read.  Had a lot of sex scenes so some people may not be interested.
B008BI8FMS|2.0|I tried contacting the seller just saying, &#34;hey, you know, before you say something is used but in very good condition, make sure it actually plays the music.&#34;<br />never got a reply. maybe they thought i was stupid for saying anything.<br />i wasn't looking for it to be perfect. i knew what i was getting into when i went looking for a used vinyl album, but the lack of dialogue between me and the seller was a let down. the album was a father's day gift for my husband and i feel like i let him down.
0345531965|4.0|A multimillionaire who dislikes all of his illegitimate children as much as they dislike him gives them to think he is leaving his fortune to them, but then commits suicide having actually bequeathed his fortune to his illegitimate and unknown daughter who was working as a missionary in the Pantanal (deep in the rainforests of Brazil). The woman has never had any contact with her father, and is about as isolated as it's possible to be, living among a tribe of Indians and having cut herself off almost completely from the world. Her only contact is the missionary organisation that placed her.<br /><br />The novel follows the investigative journey of a representative of the legal firm who acts as executor for the billionaire's estate. He's a washed-up drunk, formerly a star litigator, now on the wagon. His journey into the rainforests to seek the woman transforms his life, and her encouragement to him to seek God have an effect on his soul. The bittersweet ending leaves plenty of room for his continued growth, but still leaves you feeling like he's in God's hands, on his way to a good place.<br /><br />The Testament was my first John Grisham book. I've seen a couple of films based on his books, and was never really inspired to read him, but my pastor at a Baptist Church in Denver recommended this book to me. He explained that John Grisham is a Christian. He doesn't write Christian books, but he is a Christian who writes books. I identified with that, since it describes me as well. He particularly recommended the Testament because of its inclusion of Christianity as a positive force in its plot.<br /><br />Grisham's depictions of the high flying circles in which the billionaire's family moved was fascinating, and a bit depressing. Everyone is out simply for what he can get. They may be a bit like caricatures, but they seemed real enough while I was reading the book.<br /><br />His depictions of the towns the lawyer passes through in Brazil on his way into the jungle are brilliant, turning them into places I want to visit. Better still are the descriptions of jungle travel, which gives a great flavour of a journey made in difficult environment which often defies man's efforts to cope with it, let alone tame it. My favourite parts of the story were probably the ones set in the Indian village where the lawyer finally finds the woman who is to be heir to the fortune. Here is my main complaint about this book: these parts are too short.<br /><br />The missionary, heir to a huge fortune, wants nothing to do with it, refuses to sign the papers or even to acknowledge her inheritance, wanting only to live in peace with her Indians. During their time together, the missionary appeals to the lawyer's spiritual side, which he didn't even know he had, urging him to pray and to take an interest in God. Her conversations with him don't show much theological depth, referring in a general way to God and praying, which does not ring true. Baptist missionaries I have known tended to speak the Gospel with more precision than this missionary does, which means either Grisham held back from fully stating his faith or his publishers wouldn't allow it, this not being a religious book. Either way, while her character rings true in most ways, her attempts to persuade the lawyer to come to God did not.<br /><br />While I did not find the end of her story particularly satisfying, the story of what happened to the money, where it ended up and how it was to be used, was satisfying indeed.<br /><br />This was a good book, well written, always entertaining, touching on some deep themes (though not delving far enough into them), and leaving an impression on me. I recommend it to all and sundry.<br /><br />Reviewed by the author of [[ASIN:B01FVBEZ3U Send Him Victorious]].ant to visit.

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|it is a long one, and teamed with violence, but enjoyable! I would not recommend this for Tweens, however, a well rounded teenager should do well with this,
B00CF34B2I|3.0|This app is 1.2 Gb and kindle fire 1st generation can only hold up to 1.17 Gb in apps, so it is impossible to download.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This book gives the reader another way of thinking about one's own mortality.<br />At times this book seems to drag, maybe repetitive, but I believe that is simply due to the nature of what the author is trying to explain.  This was obviously a mind blowing experience for himself and to explain that to the &#34;general public/reader&#34; in an educated yet personal way is no small task.<br />I had the pleasure of attending a talk given by Dr. Alexander not long after I finished this book, bringing with me my daughter and teenage friend who had just recently lost her mother (both also read the book).  We all agreed that his message is one of hope and goodness and a wonderful opportunity for people to take a closer look at their lives.<br />I would definitely recommend this book.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Well worth the buy, definitely give the game a try. Has many items and the charms that play a big part that changes gameplay from the last game. The online is good most of the time but could use some work. Ability to earn gems in nice

B00CM9JKQM|5.0|I've been a huge Queensryche fan since seeing them live in 1991.  With every album release since the mid 90's I would find myself saying \\"this isn't as good as the last one.\\"  I could always find a track or two that made buying the album worth it until \\"American Soldier.\\"  I've seen them many times live and their shows kept me loyal to the brand.  After \\"Dedicated to Chaos\\" I had given up and moved on to Kamelot.  Then the news hit last year that Geoff was out and I didn't know what to think or expect anymore, but the band with new singer in tow kept saying they were getting away from lounge music and going back o their roots; the sound that fans have been begging for.  I'm not going to sit here and hate on Geoff, it is what it is and I may even buy FU one day, just not today.<br />  Today I got the Deluxe version of the new Queensryche cd.  The packing is similar to Kamelot's \\"Silverthorn.\\"  It is a box and inside were several cool pieces of odds and ends Queensryche stuff: guitar pic, sticker, patch, and three mini-buttons.  The digipack the cd actually came in was a little thin and disappointing, but oh well.<br />  A lot has been said about the music on here and the return to metal. It is not as heavy as the EP or \\"The Warning.\\"  Nor is it as experimental as \\"Rage For Order\\"(my favorite album)or \\"Promised Land.\\"  To me it is closer to \\"Empire\\" a hard rocking sound that is also trying to be radio friendly.  The tunes are catchy and there are the great choruses that we have been missing from some of their last albums.  As soon as I put the cd in my car cd player (Bose) I found my head bopping along to the music and thumbs drumming on the steering wheel.  I was also smiling and having a good time listening to this cd.  So far (surprisingly)my favorite track is the Parker Lundgren track \\"Where Dreams Go To Die.\\"  It has a feel of \\"The Real World\\" to it. \\"Vindication\\" so far is my least favorite.  I kind of wish I had thought to listen to the cd again while typing this just to see if my view would change.  What stands out most is Scott Rockenfield.  His drum work is better than anything they have ever put out before. His soundtrack influences also show on \\"X2\\" and \\"Midnight Lullaby.\\" On Todd there are times when you realize you aren't hearing Geoff anymore and then there are times you completely forget that it isn't Geoff and it just sounds like Queensryche!<br />  There are people slamming it for the mastering.  Well my hearing is not very good anymore and listening to it now on my computer I can hear some issues, but in my car on the Bose stereo I didn't hear any kind of static or breaking up of the sound.  I thought it sounded fantastic in my car on 18.  Do yourself a favor and get this album.  It is unfortunate that \\"some\\" people will rate this by who is in the band and who isn't, just as there are those who never excepted Sammy Hagar in Van Halen and probably some who never excepted Brian Johnson in AC/DC and even those who don't like anything without Chris Degarmo in Queensryche.  This cd is worth it and it is worth spending the extra $$ on the deluxe version for the extra tracks.  Our beloved tryryche is bold on the front and metal.  It is also riveted into place signifying that Queensryche is back and they are not going to fade away into the dust ever again.
