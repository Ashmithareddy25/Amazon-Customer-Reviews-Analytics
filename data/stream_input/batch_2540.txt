0425263924|2.0|I think this story needs an ending soon. I have nothing against authors making five books so long as they can make the story interesting. But here? There is too much unnecessary drama going on. I get that life is complicated but this is fiction. After a tough day at work I want to pick up a romance novel where two imperfect characters fall in love and manage to find a way to be together despite all their problems. But this book was a miss. I have no problems with love triangles but the situation with Brett cannot be described as a love triangle. He might be \\"hot\\" but he is a pest. Eva says constantly that she doesn't want to lead him on but she is! If she didn't want anything to do with him she would have said \\"look buddy you are part of my past. I don't want anything to do with you. No meetings, dinners, or whatever. Move on! I have a boyfriend.\\" It feels as if Sylvia Day is trying to force something where there isn't anything. It makes me feel awkward and annoyed when I read the scenes between Eva and Brett. Don't get me started with Cary. He needs a reality check! Trey deserves someone better. I have no complaints about Gideon. He might be obsessive but he does love Eva. But seriously it feels as if this book and Reflected in You could be shortened and combined to make a decent book. I don't know what more Sylvia Day can write about in two more books. To sum up: this series is starting to turn into a bad predictable soap opera. You can skip books 2-4 and read the last book.
B008JFUMHE|5.0|Ocean's Eleven meets The Italian Job in this high pace heist movie. If you even love one of them this is a movie that will grip you from beginning to end. I won't give away details, but \\"nothing is what it seems\\"; and who does not love to be fooled every now and then and still have a great feeling when the credits show up? That is what this movie is: a great plot, interesting characters, funny dialogues, and one big misdirection....
B000EQ47GS|4.0|Yes, you've heard every track a million times on Classic Rock Radio and, yes, there were a million clones most of whom ended up on Classic Rock Radio as well.  If you can look past that and listen with fresh ears this is an outstanding album.  Tom Scholz's production and guitar work is flawless and Brad Delp's vocals are incredible.<br /><br />The remaster sounds every bit as good as the original vinyl.  If you haven't become completely jaded to the Boston sound this album is well worth owning.

B00BKEMX28|3.0|Men of a certain age start to reflect on their life and contemplate their mortality.  Some go out and buy a Corvette.  Some get divorced and start dating 20 year olds. Others chose to form a band with their wife, and that is the direction Reznor went in.<br /><br />Not that the music is bad (although, it is not as good as fellow aging rocker Maynard James Keenan’s crisis band Puscifer).  There are some good pieces, with interesting rhythms and dark atmospheres.  ‘How Long’ seems to be stuck in the head all the time.  My problem (if you could call it that) is that it sounds too much like NIN.  Several of the songs feel like they were borrowed/b-sides of Year Zero or With Teeth, and since they are so near to NIN sound it is impossible not to compare them to each other.<br /><br />Bottom line is that Keenan managed to create a very different sound with Puscifer, but Reznor seemed to stay too close to home with How to Destroy Angels.  It will be interesting to see if there is a greater divergence between the two entities in the future.

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Loved these characters and was so excited to finally wrap things up and see what happens... or so I thought...not sure what trilogy means to Sylvia or her publishing company but to most of the world it means 3! I returned my book for a refund. It was a waste of $10!! Nothing happens and I was left with more questions So I checked out some reviews only to find out there will be 5 books!! So i stopped where I was at and retuned the book. I am extremely disappointed and feel let down by this author. I am now done with this series on principle! I felt lied to and schemed into spending more money.
B00C061I3K|5.0|I have not been able to put this album down since I got it.  Love it, as do most of my peers.  Even my dad jams out to it.  If you are a fan of electronica, classical, disco, funk, or just dance, you need to give this a shot.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|What a great chic-flick.  Juliannne Hough was great.  It was suspensful without freaking me out.  The ending had a great twist.
1476733953|4.0|I was tipped off to this story as a result of a Wall Street Journal article on the shift of power from publishers to authors. Evidently Howey made over $1 million as a result of selling this in e-book form and by the time the publishers came calling he was in no mood to sign over the digital rights or re-title the books since he would have lost the great reviews he built up in Amazon and Goodreads. Evidently the serial nature of the releases came as a result of popular demand. So, Hugh, more power to you. The great illustration in the WSJ article (someone should make it into a T shirt) and the description of a world populated by folks living in a deep concrete silo as the outside world was so toxic and polluted that no one could survive out there sounded interesting and it was. Good story, good character development. Give it a try. And Hugh, \\"good on ya\\" as the Brits put it. (Or is it the Aussies?) Keep it up. Not bad for a guy working part time in a bookstore!

She is quickly drawn back into her dysfunctional family drama and struggles not to fall back into cutting herself to cope.<br /><br />Flynn is a great writer--though this was not quite as tight and surprising as 'Gone Girl', the book had compelling characters and some good twists and suspense. I enjoyed it.

B00COGY2P2|4.0|Ok..so I can take or leave Tom Cruise. I feel his films most times are good but sometimes pretty bad (re Cameron Diaz and the motorcycle stunts).  But this one is different! He plays a PI called in by a mass murderer to prove his innocence. But before Reacher can even talk to the guy he (the murderer) ends up in a coma...it goes on from there and is actually a good little cop/mystery/thriller. Apparently based on a book so now I have to buy the book.<br />PS...love the fact it was filmed in Pittsburgh, my home town!

B009H7SCMA|5.0|'Gabriella' by Alan Hardy is the first book I have read by this author. What was apparent straight away was the author's skill in keeping his audience captivated.<br />Now, I am not a huge fan of the genre (although I am a fan of cricket) however I would definitely buy more of this author's work due to the fact that I really enjoyed reading Gabriella.<br />I especially enjoyed the humor in this read, you could definitely tell the author was British with his sharp wit, Jim's parents were extremely hilarious.<br />All in all a great solid effort and a book that I would recommend to anyone who would like a funny, naughty and entertaining read.
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|Enough for me to say that this was not as great and gripping a read as Lee Child's other Reacher stories.

B001P5HI4A|5.0|This is the best ever Barbra film.  She is acting, singing, and directing.  She is truly the triple threat of 80's and 90's Hollywood.  DVD arrived in great condition, thuroughly satisfied with product.
0767817478|5.0|Godzilla movie ever. I don't care what these (one star critics) say. It is quite obvious they don't know what they are talking about. Godzilla looks like it really could exist. The old Godzilla was stupid looking. This new one is streamed line. Looks more like a real reptile. I like the actors Matthew Broderick does a decent job but portraying scientist whose job is find out why Godzilla exist. Matthew still looks like a kid but he probably will for the rest of his life. Vicki Lewis (known for her blood colored hair) is also a scientist. She plays Matthew's boss. I think is good looking my self. Maria Pitillo plays a reporter who is also Matthew's girl friend. She's not a bad looker. It is like a roller-coaster ride though the whole film. Worth five stars.
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|This is an excellent movie for the young and old. This is a must have for any Wizard of Oz fan.
0375869026|1.0|I know that Wonder has gotten a million rave reviews.  As a school librarian I know that many of my students have read it and praise it highly.  Nonetheless, I am deeply disappointed in the book.  It is inconsistent and jumps around in oddly unpleasant ways.  None of the characters rang true to me as they were stereotypes formed to fit the needs of the author.  The many grammatical errors drove me insane and I nearly gave up in the chapter written with no capitals.  (But those are personal pet peeves which may not bother others as much.)<br /><br />What bothers me most is the need to include a million side traumas--Grandma dying, the dog dying, the divorce of Miranda's parents which pushes her over the edge so she is unkind to Via, and so many other things.  Why are there precepts in the book if nothing really comes from them?  Were they put in so that teachers would have something to grab for teachable moments?  Finally, why does it all tie up so neatly with everyone just as happy as clams?<br /><br />A friend recently made a comparison between children's literature in North America and that in Australia.  Australians, she said, want books to be fun to read so that kids will like reading and think of it as pleasurable.  North Americans (at least Canada and the U.S.) want there to be a suitable moral at the end.  Wonder wants to have a neat and tidy package of morals at the end so that none of them carry much clout and the book is more tear-fest than enjoyable read.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|but after reading all of these reviews, I went straight to my account and returned it for a refund.  I'm so bummed because I was SO excited to get the final book.  Now I find out it's not the final one at all.  It was already to the point where the story needed to be wrapped up.  I can't imagine drawing it out for 2 more books after this one.  I'll just wait until either a) the price drops or b) the library gets it.  Or I may go to a second hand book store and buy it later.  But from the reviews, it may not be worth buying at all.  Thank you to everyone for your reviews so that I could make this decision.

1400067820|5.0|This is the fourth book I have read by Mr Taleb. It was amazing, loved the ideas and the concepts. I was very disappointed when I finished the book as to what can I read next to meet the standard set by this book. It was enlightening and provides a rigor to ones thought process. Thanks so much please kept writing, I do understand how you would get hate mail (closed minds).
B000VK99Z6|5.0|This movie is very funny and since i have a cop in my family its even better. Everyone in the house likes this movie
B009NY43NY|2.0|I feel the same way that most of the other readers do. This book was rushed and the character depth was shallow. I only enjoyed the fact that Eric ended up away from Sookie because the idea of watching her grow old was out of the question and not exciting. If Sookie's interaction with Quinn and Alcide would have had more details and excitement then it would have been a whole lot better. AS far as Bill, that part of the story went dead (no pun intended) when Eric sold him out to Sookie on his real reason for meeting her in the first place. Sookie ending up with Sam isn't a big surprise. You could see in the first few books that he likes her and that she cares for him, but her using the cluviel dor on him in #12 was the catalyze for them to think about their \\"friendship\\". However, a few more lead-up scenes in the other books would have made their bedroom scene more meaningful. The overall plot of the book was just too much. It should have focused on Claude and the Devil and not the lawyer or Steve Newlin. As far as the \\"devil\\" this character was not explained at all and it should have. Sookie going up against the DEVIL!!!! That would have been a perfect way to end. Maybe use the cluvior dor as a \\"gateway/radar\\" as the Devil being summoned for one final challenge. Have Sam be the \\"great hero\\" against the devil as opposed to Eric and Bill when they realize for some reason they cannot defeat the devil by mere strength or killing. Let Quinn and Alcide be Sam's \\"posse\\" and assist Sookie in finding clues to get her out the jam. Let the Devil be used a way to give origins to weres, shifters, and vampires. Well....looks like I would have had more fun writing the last book than reading it. I appreciate the entire series to have something to read after writing a long and tedious dissertation for grad school.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|good movie, really enjoyed it, all except for the ending thought that was a bit cheesy. but worth the watch and have watched it a couple times alredy
B001XULSG6|5.0|I love Trek..This was one of the best Trek movies. Great action. Good character development. True to the Star Trek universe.
0425263924|5.0|Sooo... I loved the crossfire series and while this one is smoking with the scenes, there is alot of set up going on for the next books in the series, yes it ends in the middle of something but I am so glad it is not a crazy cliffhanger like the second book. I was happy with were Eva and Gideon are, but OMG- is there some set ups for some future drama all around the block and back.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|The sixth studio album from Queens of the Stone Age is a rock album that is definitely a defining moment for all participating members. It is the most revealing, most focused album for the veteran rockers and it is definitely their most ambitious effort yet.<br /><br />Keep Your Eyes Peeled - A perfect opener that puts everything out on the table atmospherically for the album. Filled with their trademark falsettos (also an appearance by Jake Shears from Scissor Sisters) and awkward guitar riffs, a very raw and heavy track that just takes you for a ride from start to finish. Intense harmonies and pauses make this a dynamical treat. It sets the precedent for the whole album. 10/10<br /><br />I Sat By The Ocean - Goes right into a nice groove with an elegant lead before getting straight to the vocal. Lyrics match perfectly with the overall feel of the music. More polished than what you would hear on their previous works but necessary in this instance. This is classic Queens right here and will please any longtime fan such as myself. My only criticism is that the chorus could have been more dynamic but nonetheless a good track. 8/10<br /><br />The Vampyre Of Time And Memory -  A slower track that rides on the piano and leans on smooth breathy vocals. The build up to the harmonies is beautifully written and is definitely emotionally heavier than what you would ever expect from these guys. 9/10<br /><br />If I had A Tail - The albums pop song but still containing the dark undertones from before. The keyboard effects and the guitar being in sync with each other just adds this unique feeling that makes this a standout track. Mark Lannegan makes a subtle appearance which is always a pleasure on a Queens track. 8/10<br /><br />My God Is The Sun - A defining track that just straight up kicks you in the teeth. A high dynamic in-your-face track with that signature \\"desert rock\\" feel. All the nooks and crannies of this track will be ear candy through and through and will leave you wanting more. 10/10<br /><br />Kalopsia - What we have here is one of this albums masterpieces. The verse shimmers with beautiful peaceful soundwaves of emotion before jolting you to reality with a fiery chorus that fits perfectly like the last piece of a puzzle. One of the best rock songs in recent years in which will age like fine wine. A personal favorite of mine that I will return to often. 10/10<br /><br />Fairweather Friends - Musically intricate and colorful, sounds like something you'd hear from a new Them Crooked Vultures record (Josh Homme's recent project with Dave Grohl and John Paul Jones). An all-star track featuring Dave Grohl, Nick Oliveri, Mark Lannegan and Elton John. You are taken through a nice wide variety of ups and downs that ultimately satisfy. I wish they would have turned up the vocal for Lannegan and Elton though. 9/10<br /><br />Smooth Sailing - For me this is their weakest track for this record but still really good which just goes to show how on point they are this time around. A semi-weak verse with a great chorus to balance it out, it keeps my attention but doesn't emit the same amount of energy like the other tracks have done for me. 7/10<br /><br />I Appear Missing - Ladies and gentleman, hands down the best they've ever done and quite possibly one of the best rock songs in years. Every note is exactly where it should be and you will be reassured by my statement upon multiple listens. Each section conveys into each other with grace and harmony. I never expected a track like this from these guys but here it is and now it's instantly one of my favorite songs and an instant classic might I add. Perfect vocals, perfect song structure and just a great all around feeling throughout the 6 minutes this song plays within your presence. 10/10<br /><br />Like Clockwork - An emotional closer to this magnificent piece of art. I personally think this QOTSA at their most vulnerable. Reminds me of something Pink Floyd would do or say when Josh sings \\"Not everything that goes around comes back around\\". Powerful words that provoke thoughts of your past, present and future. During this track I realized a whole new respect for these musicians. 9/10<br /><br />This album is in a league of its own. Beautiful, dark, haunting and memorable. As a musician this album has inspired me and has pushed me to writing music again. While some will read my review as an overreaction, many will read my review as a dead-on response to the brilliance of this record. Having seen 9/10 of this record performed live at The Wiltern here in Los Angeles, I can say that the songs here translate just as well if not better live so I would like to suggest catching this band in concert where ever you live in the world. Now go on, buy the record...experience it.
0439023491|5.0|The whole series is magnificently crafted.  Don't start any one of these books unless you plan to skip everything else in life until you have finished it.  What a joy!  And the eerie parallels to today's world can add another dimension.

0525953728|5.0|This book sheds light on the incredible men and women of our military and intelligence communities.

They make our allies rejoice and our enemies tremble!
B00CXN2JNS|4.0|Megadeth continues to churn out new music every few years, and it is time for their latest offering Super Collider.  Megadeth is a band that will never be accused of making the same album over and over again.  I thought Endgame was their best in a long while, but don't come looking for a rehash of that album.  Super Collider does not feature the large doses of high-paced thrash still that was quite common on Endgame.  Some songs - namely \\"Don't Turn Your Back...\\" - still have the same driving double bass and trading off of guitar solos that will take you back to Holy Wars, but there are some interesting diversions that are almost unrecognizable as Megadeth songs.  The funky opening of \\"The Blackest Crow\\" has Bluegrass(?) overtones with the banjo and fiddle.  The banjo sticks around for additional stretches, but then it takes more of a standard metal feel for the solo only to come back to the banjo again with crows cawing.  It sounds crazy, but it is probably the most interesting and daring song Megadeth has recorded.  Finally, there are the catchier, mainstream sounds of the title track and \\"Forget To Remember\\".  I like these songs a lot, but Megadeth could be accused of selling out by hardcore fans.<br /><br />Overall, I think Super Collider is a good album, but it depends on what your expectations are.  If you are looking for the sound of Endgame or \\"classic\\" Megadeth, then you are likely to be disappointed.  However, those interested in metal influenced music that refuses to fit cleanly in a specific box are more likely to be pleased.  I definitely advise prospective buyers to give the samples a thorough listen before buying.<br /><br />Download this:  Don't Turn Your Back...

There is nothing to plug in (except for the first time you use it) , everything syncs up the first time, and there is no confusion.

B000H7J9QM|4.0|I thought this was an awesome movie, I love the soundtrack, all the cars, Eleanor, everything. Probably my favorite NC movie of all time. So you have Kip who's a car thief on a 50 car boost job, only problem is he's young, cocky & pretty much inexperienced for the job. So he fumbles it & gets caught up, the guy who hired him for the job naturally gets ticked off & grabs the kid to end him. Memphis (Cage), who's apparently a legendary car thief himself, comes in to rescue his kid brother, Kip by taking the 50 car order to save his brothers life in a daring one night mega boost. Everything go's as planned until the final car on the list, 1967 Ford Mustang Shelby GT500, ELEANOR! Now if you are a true car guy, then this would be a must for your collection even if you are not a Ford fan, either the real deal or 1/18 diecast if you cannot afford it. As of this writing, an Eleanor has recently sold at an auction for $1million. This is the car those fools that wrote Fast & Furious Tokyo should've used for the final race. So then, all the cars do get delivered, maybe not all in one piece but they do get there. Our contractor who hired Cage to do the job seems to never had any intentions of paying for the job but he gets dealt with & we have a happy ending. My only gripes about this movie was I didn't really like Jolie's hair, it looked really disgusting she doe's not look good as a blonde, she rolls up on the crotch rocket & says \\"no questions i'm here for Kip\\", well duhh. Can 50 top end cars even be boosted in one night like that, I don't know I mean even with good careful planning that's alot of expensive cars. Great movie though, highly reccomend it...

B00AEFXXZU|5.0|I had seen this movie a half dozen times prior to purchasing this on Amazon. So there really wasn't any doubt that I would like this one. This is based on a true story, and while I've read it is not totally accurate in regard to the depiction of the actual story, the acting is so great and makes it totally worth seeing even if you're not a fan of boxing.
B002WN35DC|1.0|[[ASIN:B002WN35DC EL PRINCIPITO (Spanish Edition)]]<br />A real classic but unfortunately with no DRAWINGS, there is no way to imagine what the author is telling only if you had seen the drawings before.<br />At the begining I gave it 2 stars because the translation is good and worthwhile book, but without pictures really do not make sense 1 star is fair.<br />Todo un cl&aacute;sico, pero por desgracia sin dibujos, no hay manera de imaginar lo que el autor est&aacute; diciendo s&oacute;lo si hubieras visto los dibujos antes.<br />En un inici&oacute; le di 2 estrellas porque la traducci&oacute;n es buena y el libro vale la pena, pero sin ilustraciones realmente no hace sentido 1 estrella es mas que justo.
B002BGFUPQ|2.0|I don't know what movie all the people giving this garbage 4 stars saw but all I saw was junk. Ok so a you cocky American reject comes to Japan to live with his Navy father because of troubles with the law in the U.S. Tell me if this makes sense to any of you reading this: he's a high school kid, he go's to the Japanese high school with Japanese kids, he gets an invite to see some drifting & one of the guys at the drift meet lets him borrow his car to race the drift king after he insults this guy while trying to pick up the guys girlfriend. All of this seems to go down in the first couple days of the guy arriving in Japan. So during the course of the movie, he learns the art of drifting & then races the guy who beat him at the start of the movie again to pay off a debt & also takes his girlfriend in the process. So let me tell you what was wrong with this movie, EVERYTHING!<br /><br />-The Japanese guys girlfriend was a typical bimbo who's just hangin out with this dude until something better comes along, our hero the American high school kid, she was in love with the guy the minute she laid eyes on him, no loyalty to her boyfriend who at that point had done everything for her.<br /><br />-Our main character attends a Japanse High School, now I've lived on mainland Japan & Okinawa a combined 6 years & I have never seen any American kids going to any Japanese schools other than the ones who's military fathers married local Japanese women & those are the hybrid kids who speak english & Japanese fluently.<br /><br />-For the final race, they took a busted Mustang that belonged to the main characters father & rebuilt it with a Nissan S15 engine as the power plant. Now if you are a true American who loves muscle cars then this should've been the biggest insult of all. You DO NOT take one of Henry's cars & drop a Japanese motor in it...<br /><br />The good thing about the movie was that in the end it came down to broken trust between two friends & it was not about the main female character even though I think the female character was under the impression that it was about her it good it wasn't. But it did end with this high school kid as the so-called new drift king of Tokyo which in itself was pretty insulting to the hardcore Japanese drifters. They take what they do pretty seriously and there's no way they would let some young underage upstart come in like that and make them all look bad. If Hollywood wants to do another F&F movie in Japan, perhaps they should actually talk to the guys who are in the life & respect the trade...
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|Not bad. A little sensitive controls, but overall decent game. Wish it was a different track every time though. I've played for hours though.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Thank you Sylvia for sharing this next installation of the saga of Gideon and Eva.  I love the twists and turns in this story.  I cannot wait to read more.  I know that there were some delays that were out of your control...but it has been worth the wait.  I don't want to put any spoilers in here, but I LOVE IT...
B00BEXB18M|3.0|Frantic, rapid, relentless, tenacious. These are all words with which to describe 'Endgame' - Megadeth's 2009 masterpiece. `Endgame' was a return to Megadeth's early thrash sound, delivered with a sense of experience and an ear for strong hooks. In my opinion, it was Megadeth's finest release, hands-down. So, when Dave Ellefson mentioned back in February that the new record was reminding him of Megadeth's debut - 'Killing is My Business', - I naturally got pretty excited; I thought we were in for another blistering thrashfest! Buuuut, as we all know now, that wasn't to be. Instead, we got the mixed bag that is 'Super Collider'.<br /><br />Now, first of all, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't somewhat disappointed by this album, but, at the same time, I'd be lying if I said this was a bad album. In spite of what you may have been reading on Blabbermouth, this record is actually alright - good, in fact. That's right, despite being let down by the fact that my hopes of a furious thrash explosion were dashed, I'm not feeling too gutted. Why, you may ask? Simple; thrash isn't the only form of music I enjoy, nor is it the only form of music I come to expect from Megadeth.<br /><br />Heck, Megadeth released a whole string of reasonably accessible hard rock albums throughout the 90's, and I liked every one of them. Even Megadeth's recent forays into catchy rock music have delivered some great results - &#34;The Scorpion&#34;, &#34;We the People&#34;, &#34;Washington is Next!&#34;, etc. So, you know what, I'll just take what Megadeth give me, stylistically speaking. What ACTUALLY disappoints me about this album is that it just feels like not enough effort or thought went into it; there are some premises for some GREAT songs here, but so many of them feel incomplete and underdeveloped.<br /><br />For example, the song &#34;Beginning of Sorrow&#34; is just crying out for a better bridge! That song has a great dark tone to it, and a pretty epic feel too, but it's just let down bya bridge that only serves to break the song's momentum, rather than building it into something great. &#34;Dance in the Rain&#34; is another big perpetrator. It's actually the best song on the album, but it could have been so much more. Remember on the title track of 'Endgame', how it had a progression of riffs and musical passages, each with rising intensity, which built towards a really great crescendo? Well, &#34;Dance in the Rain&#34; comes frustratingly close to doing just that, before falling at the final hurdle. With every transition, this song just gets better and better, before fizzling out with a directionless ending.<br /><br />It's kind of frustrating when, as a fan, you feel that there are myriad changes and tweaks you could make to these songs to make them better. It really feels like there was no second opinion at all during this album's creation. Usually there's meant to be someone in the studio to provide said 'second opinion', and push the project in the right direction; that person is called the producer. But, in a case like this, where there's no sign of ANY producer influence, one must really take a look at the guy in the chair, and hang an enormous question mark over him. So, let's just say that I'll be treating the name 'Johnny K' with a high level of suspicion from now on.<br /><br />But, aside from that major gripe, this album features most of the elements I come to desire and expect in Megadeth's music - memorability, visceral music, and inspired delivery. It's got some mighty fine riffs, some terrific soloing, and some catchy choruses. For example, &#34;Forget to Remember&#34; is, ironically, a track that will definitely remain lodged in your brain for days after you've heard it. It also builds really nicely, I must say; it's probably the most fleshed-out and well-structured song on the album. Also, the title track - whether you love it or hate it - displays Dave's affinity for penning an unforgettable piece of music. Songs like &#34;Don'tTurn You Back...&#34;, &#34;Off the Edge&#34;, and &#34;Kingmaker&#34; really showcase the aforementioned soloing chops that this band has at their disposal, as Mustaine and Broderick trade solos like madmen. And songs like &#34;The Blackest Crow&#34; add a nice bit of experimentation to the mix, which some may reject, but I personally welcome with open arms.<br /><br />This album also exhibits that trademark Megadeth tenacity (e.g. &#34;Built for War&#34;), if not necessarily at the speed that we're accustomed to. But I tend not to get caught up on the topic of tempo; a fast tempo doesn't make a bad song good, and a slow tempo doesn't make a good song bad. Plus, there's great music out there in all tempos, so I think we can all officially discount 'mid-tempo' as a credible critical term in music.<br /><br />Lastly, as for the lyrics, I will admit that there is more than a little moralizing going on here. But, to be honest, I really don't care. Dave is voicing his worldview through his music; that's his prerogative; musicians have been doing this for decades; let's get over it.<br /><br />So, bottom line: this is quite a decent album, albeit a little undercooked. Overall, it's an album that has most of the pieces in place, but is let down by poor structuring, missed opportunities, and some occasional bad songwriting decisions. But, the promise and the power is still there; I'm not going to go off and state that Megadeth &#34;have lost it&#34;, because that's simply not true. One only has to look at their interpretation of Thin Lizzy's &#34;Cold Sweat&#34; to know that they're still an excitement machine, musically. And one simply has view the album in a positive light to see the many great moments that are scattered across this imperfect release. 'Super Collider' is not bad, it is not a disaster, it is not an embarrassment, and it does not mark the end of the band. Sure, it's one step back from 'Thirteen' and two steps back from 'Endgame', but it's still a worthwhile entry into the Megadeth catalogue. The big question, however, is 'will I revisit this album again in the same way I do with Megadeth's other releases?' To which I respond with a confident 'yes'.<br /><br />Rating: 7/10
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So addictive! Love love this game and traveling to different parts of the world! Way to keep things spicy! Love all the characters and graphics too
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Totally disappointed.  I preordered this highly anticipated book in August 2012.....waited anxiously for the &#34;final&#34; book, in what was what I thought was a trilogy.  The first 2 books were great...this one was just crap.  Just filler to stretch a trilogy out into 5 books.  A ridiculous greedy money grab.  Ms. Day has lost the respect of this former fan.  I really cared about these characters...now I am heart broken to say...I don't and will not be reading the rest of the unnessesary series.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so much fun you pretty much are dumped into a huge blocky world and left to do whatever. You can build whatever you want, mine trees and stone with your bare hands, fight monsters and more!!!!!! In the PC version there is the Nether, but that's another story......BUY THIS APP!!!!!! I swear on my life, it is totally worth every penny.
B0049U4NQO|5.0|I absolutely loved the Alex Rider Series. However I don't quite agree that Jack should be allowed to die in the end. Maybe she should get mildly hurt to make Alex anxious. But over all it was totally amazing.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|I still have not figured it out.  Don't know how to save the pictures.  It would be nice if it came with instructions.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I purchased this mouse to replace a Razer Lachesis that was finally giving me some trouble. All in all, this mouse has been great. The feel took a little while to get used to after being used to the Lachesis, but fits great in my hand. The weights are nice, though 20g really isn't a huge difference either way, but it does let this mouse provide a feature not included until the more expensive gaming mice. The breathing anchor is pretty cool, but the fact that you can customize its color is really awesome. Not the typical red, green, blue scheme, but basically pick from a color pallet. Some of the color combinations don't quite work, but the customizability is far superior than many other light-up devices. Personally, I find this mouse fits in the arena with mice twice its cost. We will see how long this one lasts, but with its braided cloth cord, I have a feeling this one will be around just as long (or longer) than my 5 year old Razer.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|A touching tale about an endearing and modest man who does not find a purpose in life until he is half way through it. His determination reminds one of the spider syndrome; the trying to climb up the side of a bath and falling back each time, yet I was rooting for Harold.<br /><br />Some of the dialogue seems a bit contrived in places where Harold climbs outside his character a bit to interact with others in the narrative but by and large I though the dialogue was natural and suited Harold, being the solid, persevering character he's built to be and bearing in mind that he is sometimes the underdog.<br />It is refreshing to find a book that doesn't try to 'grab' the reader, instead creating a central character with whom the reader can empathise and identify.<br />If you are looking for a a fast-paced, gripping, page turner, then this is perhaps not it - and yet, for me, I still couldn't resist turning the pages.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|...Like Clockwork isn't as immediate as Songs for the Deaf or Rated R, but its real value comes from repeated listens.  It's surprising that this album has had such a complicated history (line-up changes, guest spots, delayed production, etc...) because it is easily the most cohesive record created by Queens of the Stone Age since Rated R.  While I enjoyed Era Vulgaris quite a bit, some songs didn't quite stand up to the rest of the album while others rank among the band's best.  Now, after what feels like an eternity's wait, ...Like Clockwork is here.<br /><br />The band's sound is firmly intact despite a few personnel changes -- Queens of the Stone Age brings their dark, slippery sound to the table once again.  The guitar riffs are lumbering giants -- the drums are near-mechanical in their bombardment -- and the music strattles the line with both heavy melodies and heavy rhythms.  New to ...Like Clockwork is a sense of slickness: songs like \\"If I Had a Tail\\" groove nicely, but never feel soulless.  The only real complaint that I have with the record is its mastering.  Tonally, the album feels a lot like the Them Crooked Vultures debut -- loud guitars but the bass can be buried in the mix.<br /><br />So where does it rank among Queens of the Stone Age's past records?  I'd say that it's better than Lullabies to Paralyze and Era Vulgaris (both great in their own right) but not quite as good as Rated R or Songs for the Deaf.  Unfortunately, everything Josh Homme and company creates will be compared to Songs for the Deaf, so I hate to make the comparison myself.  I don't think that ...Like Clockwork has songs that blow up the radio like \\"No One Knows\\" or \\"Go With the Flow\\", but that's all right -- the album is incredibly enjoyable and easily worth any music lover's time and money.  If you've enjoyed QOTSA's past work, getting this album is a no-brainer.  If you've been on the fence up to this point, I'd recommend Songs for the Deaf to start, but you could do worse than to start here as well.<br /><br />Notable tracks to sample/download: \\"I Sat By the Ocean,\\" \\"The Vampyre of Time and Memory,\\" and \\"I Appear Missing.\\"to start here as well.<br /><br />Notable tracks to sample/download: \\"I Sat By the Ocean,\\" \\"The Vampyre of Time and Memory,\\" and \\"I Appear Missing.\\"

0425263924|1.0|OK where to start - first this was supposed to be a TRILOGY! Now she says there will be 5 books - NOT GOOD FOR MARKETING.<br />Secondly - where is the plot?  It seems like for Eva and Gideon's relationship it is one step forward and 12 steps back.<br />Thirdly - please do not compare it with 50 Shades of Grey. No matter where the story was going readers are always sure of Christian's love for Anna and Anna's love for Christian.  In Reflected in you I hated Gideon for the second half of the book and in Entwined with you I hated Eva for the second half of the book.<br />This is like a bad soap opera, real housewives and Kardashian's all put together!  DO not waste your money and time on this book.  Just assume that the story ended in Reflected in you!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Best book I have ever read I loved it so much and I have a huge crush on Josh Hutchinson he is so cute and. Strongest and the nicest person I have ever seen best book. Ever
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Seriously?!! I am upset with the ending. I have to agree with a lot of the other readers, there was no story line, just sex....no plot...more questions than answers. I waited for this book for so long, and there was no end. Not worth the $10.
B000X2H8G4|1.0|This was purchased for my dad who is very hard of hearing. I have perfect hearing and it didn't help me to hear better so I consider it USELESS.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game play it daily I have highest score updates are a bit slow but still enjoy it<br /> xxx
0345803485|4.0|I found the characters well developed, with Christian's mysterious past thinly veiled. He is so deliciously complex and even though he loves Ana, he is willing to allow her to walk away rather than attempt to come to terms with his demons. Ana is almost unrealistically brave, but she can't accept what she can't accept. She brought Christian miles beyond where he'd ever gone before emotionally.<br /><br />There were a few issues with the writing, but engrossed in the psychological aspect of the characters, I could overlook them. My main peeve was the use of 'arggh', an expression normally reserved for pirates. Also, using her inner goddess vs. her sub-conscious irritated me a little, but all in all it was an interesting way to show her conflict.<br /><br />It is my sincere hope that these books don't spark experimentation with this lifestyle. Every man who has a desire to punish and control women is not as self-restrained as Christian Grey. This can be dangerous.<br /><br />I'm on to read the next book in the trilogy.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|This album offers some of Hendrix's most smooth and lush songs. The guitar work is amazing to say the very least.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game my battery goes down because I play it so much I recommend this just make sure you plug it up at night I'm addicted when I'm typing right now I can't even stand it this is the longest I've been away from it GET THIS APP you'll love it please make a second game of this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:)(:please say this was helpful<br />!thanks:)
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book shows us how deep the human mind can be, and how we can inevitably find ourselves in life!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I don't get all the reviews that complain about how bright the mid range and high end frequencies are on these cans.  They're studio monitors.  They're supposed to be flat-but-responsive.  If it's hard to listen to then add some EQ to your signal chain.<br /><br />They respond across the entire spectrum.  From low end to high.  You can't ask for much more than that.<br /><br />The only valid complaint that I see about these cans is the earpads are flimsy and come apart easily.  I hope sony fixes that in their manufacturing process at some point.<br /><br />Mine work flawlessly.  5 stars until I start to have issues with the earpads.  Then I may come back and edit this review.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|it is the best game I have ever played and to make it even better it is a mind game so cool I love it
B00CT2P6VA|4.0|I always get to an impass with the firts two games. I run out of coins before I get to the final solution This game gives me morer to explore with plenty of coins! plus it is gorgeously illustrated and artistic.<br />I loved the old man's narrative as well.
B004YW4L5K|3.0|I found this book very entertaining. Did I always know what was going on...Nope nor did I fully understand everything. But it had a great cast of characters and a mixed up storyline that you just wanted to read to find out where it was going. Definitely a book I would re-read because I would discover something new with each reading.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|The writing is over the top well done!  The subject is near and dear to my heart, both in driving race cars and in loving dogs.  That may be the reason that I felt no need to finish it.  It seemed less than new to me.  Not denigrating it for others and if you want great prose from a brilliant mind, this may be for you.  Sometimes I march to a drummer apparently heard only in my mind, not by all.
B00992CF6W|1.0|it will not even install in my kindle fire waste of my time n money do not buy this appppppppppp
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|THESE SERIES MUST STOP.<br />They have become a licence to print money for the author. Well I hope Ms Day has learnt her lesson, from all of the derogatory comments. I have read many of her books, but no more.<br />We the readers are a little fed up with being fooled.<br />I think it is about time we boycotted series. If an author feels that they have a series in them, let them put thier money where their mouths are and write them fully before publishing in parts<br />Ms Day I am CROSS, and you are FIRED!
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|Good cast and acting. The story was a little mixed up. Dark comedy mixed with teen angst love story. Overall, a decent show.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Personally, I think it is bizarre that people are incredibly upset because the series ISN'T over yet. I love the characters and I love the opportunity to see their story continue.<br /><br />That being said, I felt that the ending did a disservice to the readers and to the story. I am not criticizing the plot, nor am I bemoaning the idea of ending a book on a cliffhanger. Truth be told, I really enjoyed the storyline and loved seeing Gideon and Eva more secure, moving closer to romance and further away from dysfunction.<br /><br />The problem was that all of a sudden the book just...stopped. At the end, I kept tapping the screen to flip back and forth because I thought I accidentally skipped some pages. The ending felt abrupt, like someone walking away mid-conversation, or stopping mid-sentence. The book didn't end on some specific, massive cliffhanger, it didn't really have an ending at all.  It didn't even feel like the right spot to end a chapter, let alone a book.<br /><br />As there will be two more books, Entwined obviously was not going to answer every question and resolve every issue that has come up in the series thus far. That wasn't necessary. But there's something to be said about giving the reader some form of resolution that provides a stopping/resting point where they can eagerly await the next installment.<br /><br />I loved the scenes with Gideon and Eva, and loved the underlying mysteries as they unfolded. I don't like that I'll have to wait another year to continue reading the story that shouldn't have been interrupted here.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Enjoyed it, as I have all the Sookie books, but didn't want to see it end! It wrapped up a lot of loose ends.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I know people are upset that the Crossfire trilogy is now going to be 5 books. I totally get the frustration with the trend of authors publishing their works as installments instead of novels. That is a major gripe of mine about today's publishing environment.<br /><br />But, Sylvia Day has been quite upfront with fans on social media, especially Facebook and Twitter, answering questions about the series; and she told us months ago that Gideon and Eva were too complicated to wrap up in three books. This s series was originally planned to be a trilogy, but Ms. Day's creative muse took her in a much longer story arc. I, for one, applaud her dedication to her characters and her craft. She is not trying to pull a fast one or cram 2000 pages of material into 900 just to guarantee a HEA in 3 books.<br /><br />Whew, now that is off my chest, let's get to how much I love this book!<br /><br />Entwined With You is book 3 in the Crossfire series. Gideon and Eva start out this book so far apart, both physically and emotionally. This is due to events at the end of Reflected In You that I won't get into. Suffice to say, these two have a long way to go to get to their happily ever after.<br /><br />The connection between the two of them is just as hot and sexy and intimate as in the previous books. The love scenes are really, really, intense. This is most definitely erotic romance at it's best.<br /><br />I love the dynamics of the relationship Gideon and Eva have. They love each other. They want each other. (OMG, they WANT each other, everywhere)  Yes, they have problems, and those require real work. But, their problems are not going to tear them apart. They have a commitment to each other and their relationship. Even when Eva lets past issues cloud her joy, or the multiple ex-lovers of both keep popping up to cause drama, the love and the commitment is the priority for both.<br /><br />I waited a whole 10 hours after EWY was released before I bought it. I can guarantee that I will be re-reading re-reading it multiple times before Book 4 is released. I am totally on board with the roller coaster Sylvia Day has written for Gideon and Eva.ill be re-reading re-reading it multiple times before Book 4 is released. I am totally on board with the roller coaster Sylvia Day has written for Gideon and Eva.

B004XZR63M|5.0|As with many books, there are an incredible amount of opinions out there concerning Rich Dad, Poor Dad, and many varying views on Kiyosaki himself. What I will say is this, read the book for yourself and determine what you feel about what he has to say. The advice in this book has been a tremendous blessing to me. It is all about your perspective, about how you view money. The practical details are in your hands, that's not necessarily Kiyosaki's job. He provides the correct perspective and helps you stop living with a poor mentality. It's then your job to take what you've learned and become financially literate with your new perspective.<br /><br />This is a great book. It's a simple and straight forward read and can completely change how you think about finances. Depending on where you stand, it will either challenge you, or affirm and articulate how you have already felt your whole life. Buy this book, read it, digest it, and change how you look at finances.

B002RI9M2U|4.0|The only reason I couldn't give it 5 stars is that I like books with a feel good factor - in other words, if I'm reading for pleasure I like to escape from reality. This is not a happy book - it is a gut wrenching, thought provoking book. At times the dual dialogue gets a bit challenging, but the concept (and for the most part) the execution is excellent. Makes you think twice about the power of careless words and actions. Life is precious - make the most of it :)

B00BC5FN2C|5.0|First and foremost I'm not a political person so I was very, very reluctant to watch this show. I was also very reluctant to give Spacey a go as I had only seen 3-4 of his films and only watched American Beauty after becoming a \\"House Of Cards addict\\". Needless to say I was very happy with the end result of this entire show. Spacey, Fincher (and all the directors), all the other actors/actresses, just everything was perfect oh and especially the script I cannot leave that out. As a whole this show is simple yet if you really dive into a sub plot or even the entire plot well the picture is a bit complex. I'm extremely excited to see what they give us in season 2. Lastly I would like to address the whole idea of JUST watching it on Netflix or purchasing it as some other reviewers have complained about the price for the DVD/BD. My stance is go sign up for Netflix (get a month free) watch all 13 episodes and if you're like me you'll get hooked and want to buy it.<br /><br />A side note about the product. So far there isn't to my knowledge any word on bonus features which is a bit saddening as I would have loved to have heard some Fincher/Spacey commentary and some making of features.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and give this a go!<br /><br />*****5/5*****
B003U4UNPK|4.0|This series is definitely entertaining, but I think the writers are smokin' something.  The way the plot bounces around, I'm pretty sure those folks wake up in the morning & start implementing their dreams into the story.<br />But whatever, it IS fun to watch.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|I must admit that I place this book at the top of the list of the books on religion and atheism.  Unlike many others, Richard Dawkins doesn't pretend to be an expert on religion. Instead, he goes straight to the point and focuses on the logical inconsistency in religion and presents a scientific explanation and an alternative approach to religious faith.<br /><br />I would like to say that to complement this effort, any person interested in such topics should become acquainted with the reason why religious mythology is flawed and vague.  Yes, it is obviously flawed and vague because it was a primitive attempt to reason and understand the world.  But it helps us to understand and know the missing pieces from the main monotheistic religions in order for us to debate the die-hard believers who do not, themselves, know the answer to many questionable facts in the Bible and the Qur'an.<br /><br />I must admit that I wasn't too anxious to read this book when it first came out, or 10 years later, and so on.  When I finally came around to reading it, I wasn't disappointed, but I did have some problems with the book.<br /><br />The book focuses mainly on the three monotheistic religions.  But even then, it explains each book from the perspective of its believers.  While it does provide a healthy balance of comparative theology, she skips over the giant mantle of Semitic mythology, which wasn't just the building blocks for these religions but rather the ground upon which every one of these religions was built.  In fact, if you look at the Islam of a western Asian or an American, you'd notice that his Islam differs greatly from that of an Arab.  The same is true for the Christianity of a westerner compared to that of a Syrian, Iraqi, or an Armenian.  If we ignore that for a moment, we still realize that there are so many gaps in the religious narrative, in the mythology, and in the beliefs as well.<br /><br />Take the Biblical myth of creation or its Qur'anic counterpart.  Youcan easily see that it's incomplete, and it doesn't make sense at all.  As atheists, some of us may attribute that to human errors, since they were written by humans.  Yet, that's not an adequate explanation.  Other myths were created by humans, but they had a narrative consistency within the storyline.  It's inconceivable that these societies, which were highly cultured and intelligent by every measure, couldn't have come up with a better narrative.  So, what went wrong?<br /><br />There is ample historical and linguistic evidence to answer these questions.  When I say, \\"answer,\\" I do not mean to justify or validate these religions.  To the contrary, I think we can make the case for atheism.  But that's not the point.  The point is to explain why Satan is virtually just another deity.  Even his name, Satan, is fashioned in the typical Semitic manner used to describe deities.  Much more is discussed in the book [[ASIN:B00D3TC8R8 God's Untold Story]], which covers not just how monotheism remains largely polytheistic, but also sheds light on the many great gaps in the Biblical and Qur'anic narrative.  It is a must-read for every Atheist and Theist alike.<br /><br />Cheers.

B000VUCIZE|3.0|I like Sam Harris.  I find his view intelligent, but the topic of the book isn't the End of Faith.  Yes, he lightly touches on other religions and on faith in general, but it is quite clear that his main focus is Islam.  Even with this narrow focus, the subject would've been satisfactory had it been addressed adequately.  While the author acknowledges the \\"painful history of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza\\" in a cursory manner, just as he acknowledges western colonialism and the western heavy role in installing brutal dictatorships in the Arab world, he dismisses these factors as irrelevant in an illogical manner simply to point out to Islam being the problem.<br /><br />As an atheist, I do not think any religion is the solution to a modern society.  However, we cannot ignore the basic fact that what a religion preaches is completely irrelevant.  Religion is literally what people choose to make it, in the end of the day.  This may seem like nonsense until you examine the fact that Turkey of the 1830s-1890s genuinely tried to modernize, but as the center of the Islamic world, it had to deal with her empire falling apart after having lost its western territories to nationalist movements.  Even that wouldn't have been as destructive had it not been mixed with the Christian identity.  A case in point was the Greek revolution, which was bent on eliminating every Muslim civilian in such a horrific manner that became the same style by which the Turks and the Kurds used a 70-90 years later to exterminate all the Christians from Turkey.<br /><br />Yet, despite all of that, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, and even Iraq, Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco were becoming largely modernized, and made such great leaps forward despite the fact that they were Muslim countries.  How can the author explain all of that away?  Somehow, the peoples of these countries and their regimes found a way to embrace modernity and make Islam be OK with it.  Yet, I wonder why the author simply ignored the obvious obstacle to modernity in the Middle East: Israel!  Yes, it is unquestionable that Israel is more modern than any of its neighbors.  Nonetheless, it was a state built by Secular Jews, Leftist Jews, and just a handful of religious Jews.  Their ambitions and motivation were understandable.  After all, not every Jew shared the vision of Karl Marx and others who believed that a Jew is a citizen of the nation in which he was born.  Many Jews were fed up in having to live another century in a nation, any nation, that treated them as lepers.  Their desire to live in dignity in a homeland of their own is understandable.  Nonetheless, it wasn't built on the moon.  It was built in a land which was already the home for another million Arabs (Muslims, Christians, and Jews).<br /><br />This process came right in a time when the Syrians, Palestinians, Lebanese and Egyptians as well as other Arabs in the process of becoming independent.  The fact that Israel was born in this midst, in addition to a few wars in the process must never be overlooked in their ability to radicalize a societal segment.  Even then, how can the author overlook and not mention, not to say focus, on the fact that Hamas was nurtured by Israel to create  to combat the secular nationalists?  How can he overlook the fact that it was the United States who literally gave birth and strength to Al-Qa'eda in order to combat Communism in Afghanistan?  How can he overlook the fact that, in Iran, in the 1950s, a Leftist government was overthrown by the CIA in order to install a friendly regime?<br /><br />These factors do not negate the dangers of Islamic fundamentalism, nor do they mean that Islam hasn't gained momentum as an ideology, but his analysis is very flawed without focusing on these issues just so that Islam becomes the problem.  Islam is no more the problem in the world than Judaism is in Israel or Christianity in America.  In truth, if we want to promote reason and combat fundamentalism, we need more educated atheists and theists about the problems with the religious narrative.  Without such knowledge, such books will remain only a song back for the choir.<br /><br />There is ample historical and linguistic evidence to make the case for atheism, to explain why Satan is virtually just another deity.  Even his name, Satan, is fashioned in the typical Semitic manner used to describe deities.

B009DA74ES|4.0|For the record - my favorite seasons are 2 & 4, but Season 5 is still solid.  The RZA is a bit over the top at times but Charlie's antics make up for it as usual.

B001DF68MA|5.0|My granddaughter is 15 months and 25 lbs and tall for her age & this fits her perfectly. It looks a little small when attached but you really can't have it be much bigger or you wouldn't be able to pedal. I was a little apprehensive after reading some of the reviews but glad I purchased it. She loves riding and I feel she is safe and comfortable. Not sure how long/how old before she out grows but for the price even if it lasts just 1 year it is worth it. 4/25/15. Just want to add that this seat is still providing wonderful rides with my now 3 yr old granddaughter. I don't think she is going to be able to fit next year but the seat has held up very well and still comfortable. She is now 32 lbs, and quite a bit taller. I still highly recommend this seat!
B000X1Z0BU|4.0|I got pulled into the story rather early. Boy meets girl, girl cheats, girl goes to London, boy remains in Ireland, boy mourns. Boy meets another girl, she's married. They make great music together. Boy still misses London girlfriend. I enjoyed the music so much I bought the sound track. Only when I shared a viewing with a friend did I note the abundance of the F bomb. Beyond that disappointment, I, very much, enjoyed the story. Although the lead characters were musicians first and actors second, I saw no deficiency. The lead actor/musician wrote many of the compositions. Happy times mixed with tears. In spite of my faulting it for the language, I DID enjoy this movie - to the point of purchasing it. To help with your overall experience, be sure to watch the bonus features. Maybe, like me, you'll also buy the music. Grab a glass of wine, some cheese and crackers and sit down and watch this one.

B00BM7052S|2.0|&#34;Trouble With the Curve&#34; is yet another Clint Eastwood movie in which he is once again the cantankerous, old isolated man fighting against the odds. This time, his character is the symbolic representation of the dated, but perhaps purer, world of baseball before the computer analysts arrived with their statistical analyses of a game that the movie argues, both metaphorically and literally, should be assessed by those who have a more indefinable human approach.  It is therefore an undisguised attack on &#34;Moneyball.&#34; But this challenge is filled with more bluster than substance. In its unsophisticated, transparent attempts to make the audience smile, &#34; . . .  the Curve&#34; lacks depth, development and realism.<br /><br />Eastwood plays Gus Lobel, a veteran Atlanta Braves baseball scout whose traditional methods are not only questioned by a few of the upstart, obnoxious members in the front office- especially ambitious executive Phillip Sanderson (Matthew Lillard)- but whose eyesight is failing as well. (Ah, but he is still able to detect the ability of a hitter by the sound of his swing!!!) To help Gus defeat the villains who want him fired, Pete Klein (John Goodman), his best friend and immediate superior, tries to convince Gus's estranged daughter Mickey (Amy Adams) to lend a hand.  Waging a battle of her own combating the weary jabs of the chauvinist pigs at the all-male law office where she's been working to make partner, Mickey reluctantly pledges to look in on her father for a short time; but when she's then taken off an important case she abruptly decides to quit the firm in favor of becoming his full-time assistant.  Their subsequent rapprochement is aided by Johnny Flanagan (Dustin Timberlake), a former promising pitcher originally scouted and signed by Gus, who is now a rival scout for the Boston Red Sox.  Johnny runs into the pair when they're all in North Carolina to check out a young batting phenom, Bo Gentry.  What then occurs is so evident that I needn't tell you how the story turns out.<br /><br />This over-simplified morality tale is distasteful enough (the only thing missing is black and white hats to tell the good guys from the bad), but becomes all the more objectionable in the scenes which focus on baseball itself.  Indeed, in its ostensible effort to defend the game's honored traditions, the film commits repeated, blatant blunders, revealing a fundamental ignorance and misunderstanding of the game that even a casual fan will notice.<br /><br />The script didn't give Amy Adams much to work with, but she's easily the best thing in the movie, demonstrating once again that she is an actor of great talent and versatility.  Goodman does what we now have come to expect, a journeyman-like job in his supporting role; and for his part, Justin Timberlake does not embarrass himself. How often, however, will Eastwood continue to play the same tired character? We've seen this old grouch with the heart of gold in &#34;Million Dollar Baby&#34; and &#34;Gran Torino.&#34; He doesn't even have to read the screenplay - just show up and ad lib. Regrettably, that's what it appears he did here, and his work falls far short of what we witnessed in those other two superior efforts.<br /><br />Maudlin, clich&eacute;d, predictable and, not incidentally,  LOADED with stereotypes, &#34;Trouble with the Curve&#34; is neither a good baseball movie nor a decent film of any kind.  Allow this bad pitch to go by.ll you how the story turns out.<br /><br />This over-simplified morality tale is distasteful enough (the only thing missing is black and white hats to tell the good guys from the bad), but becomes all the more objectionable in the scenes which focus on baseball itself.

A batter who's thrown a bad pitch is expected to let it go by.  When a bad movie is released . . . .the true test of whether or not a right-handed batter can hit a curve should have been against a right-handed pitcher. A curve thrown by a right-hander appears to be coming directly at a right-handed hitter before it breaks down and away, thus confusing if not inspiring fear in the batter. Therefore, the confrontation should have pitted, in baseball parlance, \\"righty\\" against \\"righty.\\" More important, if the object was really to demonstrate the crucial significance of the curve, why would the batter be unable to hit fastballs at all? The director should have had him unfazed by that kind of pitch, but then have him fail only when facing a CURVE. The film instead missed these opportunities by ignoring baseball fundamentals, further weakening an already poor production.<br /><br />These and additional problems notwithstanding, at least Amy Adams was able to continue to show her talent and versatility. The script didn't give her much to work with, but her performance is easily the best thing in the movie. Goodman does what we now have come to expect from him, a journeyman-like job in his supporting role, and for his part, Justin Timberlake does not embarrass himself.

It's evident at every turn what's coming at you next.  When that happens in real life, you get out of the way and let it pass.When that happens in real life, you get out of the way and let it pass.

B008XNZMOU|3.0|I like Taylor Swift's songwriting capabilities.  She has a talent of writing songs that people can relate to.  Okay - so enough with the girl meets boy and boy dumps girl ballads.  Taylor has proved her point on that subject many times over.  Now comes the part that pains me to write.  I am not sure I understand the success of Taylor when there are so many talented vocalists out there who are living in her shadow.  I understand that Big Machine Records took a chance and signed her to their label.  They were lucky that she became profitable for them.  A large part of Taylor's success is her ability to entertain.  Taylor's vocals are not strong although I think they have been enhanced on some songs recorded for \\"Red\\".  I would have thought that Big Machine Records would consider Taylor a demo singer and not a recording artist.  I have said before that Taylor needs to experiment with her vocal range.  She has a hard time carrying a note and when she tries she simply falls flat.  There is no vibrato and sometimes the lyric ends abruptly or she sprinkles in \\"ooohhhs\\" and \\"aaahhhs\\".  Or \\"rreeeddd\\".  Well, you get the picture.  That being said I still enjoyed the album and most of the songs.  However, a note to Taylor.  Don't sing a song with someone who out performs you on your album.  Gary Lightbody dominated \\"The Last Time\\".<br /><br />1.  State of Grace = 7/10.  Does not have a country genre feel and Taylor's voice sounds a bit too enhanced on this.<br />2.  Red = 8/10.  I like the lyrics but could do without the \\"rrreeeddd\\".<br />3.  Treacherous = 7/10.  A softer side of Taylor.  Again, enough with the \\"I I I\\".  I think Taylor throws that style of singing in when she can't carry the note.<br />4.  I Knew You Were Trouble = 10/10.  A great song.  Wonderful lyrics (except for the \\"Me Me Me\\").  A like the way this song flows and I think Taylor does a nice job with changing her vocals a bit.  See Taylor - that's what I mean!<br />5.  All Too Well = 9/10.  This song is beautiful.  Enough said.<br />6.  22 = 7/10.  Again, the song is peppered throughout with those \\"22 oo's oo's\\".  There is lot of \\"oo's\\" in this song. Or \\"Uh huh's\\".<br />7.  I Almost Do = 7/10.  Deserves to be on a country album.  But again the \\"oo's\\" run rampant through the song.<br />8.  We Are Never Getting Back Together = 5/10.  Should not be on a country album.  This is Taylor trying to gain fans from the Pop genre.  I don't care much for this song and doesn't sound like something a 22 year old established musician would be singing.<br />9.  Stay Stay Stay = 6/10.  Okay, it's catchy and she is having fun with it as evidenced by the way she ends the song.  Again, the \\"oo's\\" make an appearance.<br />10.  The Last Time = 10/10.  Beautiful song. Gary Lightbody carries the song though.<br />11.  Holy Ground = 6/10.  I think Taylor sounds weak on this one. She could really make this song better if she would just carry a note longer and add some vibrato to it.  She needs vocal lessons on how to control her voice and sustain the notes.<br />12. Sad Beautiful Tragic = 7/10.  A bit boring but the lyrics are meaningful and Taylor does a nice job with the song.  The tone of her voice suits the song perfectly.<br />13. The Lucky One = 10/10.  Well written and different from her usual song choices.  Her vocals could be better though but it's still pleasant to listen to.<br />14.  Everything Has Changed = 10/10.  Another perfect collaboration.  This time with Ed Sheeran.  Perfection with the music, lyrics and vocals.  I wish more of the songs on the album were like this.<br />15.  Starlight =  8/10.  Again, Taylor carry a note!  Instead of repeating the word over to get the effect.<br />16.  Begin Again = 10/10.  A great song.  Sung with a lot of feeling.  Again, perfection.<br /><br />There are some bonus tracks on this album but I won't rate those.  I know some will disagree with me but I'm not trying to be hurtful.  I really think Taylor needs to expand on her vocals.  Her voice is changing as she gets older and I don't think it is changing for the better.  She is likeable and treats her fans well.  But I do think more country stars are being shunned in this industry when they have far better vocals.  I hope Taylor's next album is MORE country and she leaves the pop sounding tunes off.  And in the meantime, visits a vocal coach.
B00873GRU4|2.0|I remember reading about Dan Brown novels, that it's the premise that hooks you - the barnstorming idea.  And so you are willing to forgive the dull, cliched writing style.  For me that worked with Da Vinci code, but put me off ever buying another Dan Brown book.  I felt a little cheated, and so I never have.<br />The relevance to this novel?  I am guessing that the five star reviewers were hooked by the premise.<br />I tried to read it, but I couldn't get past the descriptions.  Unlike Brown I don't think they're too cliched.  Instead, they're often too long, too repetitive; they feel amateur.  Given such great ratings, I was very surprised to find this.<br />At the start, can the sound of children laughter really rain down or drip?  I've never known a sound to feel like that.  Perhaps others have.  Do the treads of the stairs need to be described that often and in that much detail?<br />This probably sounds like nit picking to some, but for me it's fatal as it means I can't enter into the story.  There wasnt that moment when I stopped reading, and started being in it.<br />Perhaps if this doesn't matter to you, you'll enjoy it much more than me.
B00D2ZF24O|3.0|Spoiler Free:  This was an OK movie that could have been so much more.  This is Will Smith playing a no nonsense military officer.  There was absolutely NO emotion shown.  This was the type of character that if an arm or leg was ripped off and blood was spurting everywhere, he would do nothing more than grimace or grunt a little.  A little unreal.  Especially for Will Smith. To me, his talent was stifled.<br /><br />As for Jaden, I felt like he was just an average actor.  He doesn't grip like a lead actor, which I believe he was supposed to be.  A few years and acting lessons or experience, he may well be a star.  I'm not trying to sound critical.  I just think he was a bit out of his acting league at this point.<br /><br />As for M Night Shyamalan, I didn't feel his touch.  From my understanding, he came to the picture very late in the game.  The production team seemed to be Smith this and Smith that . . . I wonder how much control Shyamalan had.  I don't know if this should be labeled as \\"Shyamalan's baby.\\"  Unfortunately, as average as this movie is, I figure he will get the blame rather than the credit.  I don't think it's going to stop his directing/writing, etc., but I think he will have to reestablish himself and won't get big money financing easily.  I do believe he will have another winner like The Sixth Sense one day. The guy has talent.<br /><br />Over all, I think this will go down as a bomb, but will be shown in reruns on TBS, TNT, ETC., for years to come.

When I realised it was all in letter form I thought I wouldn't like it all but after the first few letters I was hooked and found it very hard to put down.  It is funny and charming but also poignant and sad in places. I didn't want it to end because I had fallen in love the wonderful characters, especially Isola.  I loved Dawsey as well and wish we could have seen even more of him.  By the end I just wanted to go and live with them all on Guernsey

0765348780|1.0|I can see from the other reviews that many other readers were looking for an experience similar to A Song of Ice and Fire, and came away disappointed.  Add me to that group.<br /><br />After reading GRRM's series, I was looking for another series with detailed worldbuilding, rich characterization, and multiple compelling storylines.  Unfortunately, this series lacks everything but the worldbuilding.  Even more unfortunately, the worldbuilding doesn't make sense.  Martin's world is complex and full of history.  This world is definitely complex, and definitely has history, however, while Martin's world was intriguing and expertly detailed, this one is described using completely nonsensical prose, and no points of reference whatsoever.<br /><br />I am about 15% in, and have found the story to be nearly incoherent.  The sentence structure is bad enough on its own, but is made worse by every sentence being peppered with never-fully-explained references to characters, names, historical events, and places that you have never heard of and will or may never hear of again.<br /><br />Also, I really, really hate that some reviewers are pretentious enough to dismiss people who have valid criticisms of the quality of this writing as \\"unintelligent\\" or \\"impatient\\", that we should wait until book three when this will all start to make sense.  By definition, if a book or series is well written, one should not have to wait until the third book for it to start making sense.  Books don't retroactively become good after other books are written later on.  They're either good, or they aren't.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I highly recommend this book whether you like an uplifting story or just interested in history. Tesla was an amazing genius whose inventions were the seed for many of the great technologies of today. Makes an excellent read for a young person trying to find their path.
0316227706|5.0|The pictures put together for this book crack me up. They show dogs at their zaniest...when they are crazed trying to get a ball. The quality of the printing + book were great and exactly what you would expect for a coffee table book. I bought it for my 7-year-old nephew because I like to watch him laugh.
B003YL4KS0|5.0|A friend's older sister told me about this book and that night I read this book. I started the next day! The day after that I was recommending it.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|This was an amazing book. Good read for anyone... looking forward to the movie now!!! Please read. You won't regret it.

B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl was definitely a page turner!  When starting a book I try to anticipate where the author is going with the story, but with this one, I could not anticipate what was coming next. It was full of surprises.
B008MM9630|4.0|Building your fairy farm is fun. Cute graphics. I would give it 5 stars but there are a few kinks that need worked out.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This game is awesome and it is o one of the best games I got on my kindle. The two vehicles that I have are the monster truck and the fine buggy and upgrade hopping to get them fully upgraded just to let all of you know my name is not Mary Jo that's just my mom's name my name is MITCH or &quot;chippychaser&quot;
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I only had to pick this book up a couple times because each time I did I couldn't stop reading. A very beautiful story about true love.
1449437524|1.0|Unfortunately the first pages of this looked like good for little boys.  WRONG!  It is disgusting!  Full of language not fit for children to hear, much less read.  It &#34;looked&#34; like a childrens book.  Don't be fooled.  IT IS NOT!  I sent it directly to my grandson for his trip and his mom had to take it away and dispose of it when he started asking &#34;what does this mean&#34;.  Please don't be fooled into thinking it is for children!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I see Joseph J. S. You must watch duck dynasty I'm a huge huge fan of them but anyway great game I think every one should get it is FREE
B0042J6VUS|2.0|The spring loaded vertical  piece barley had enough travel straining for S3 without case.  Second time I put it in the piece popped out (also detaching spring).  There are two end of travel notched points that were stretched to limit and those popped out popping the piece out.  Even if I push it pack in it pops out now.  I might be able to use it with a rubber band and there is some travel remaining after the stop point.<br /><br />Too bad it did not have more travel as it would fit S-3 nicely and if designed with more travel probably could fit T3 with a silocone cover.
B008IJT0CE|3.0|It has not as of this date downloaded to my Pan digital Super Nova, not sure what happened please advise
B004FEFS5E|4.0|The author goes through all the basics very clearly, and gives in a lot of tricks. I just didn't care too much for his jokes.
B003G4W49C|5.0|If you like Sci-Fi and a compelling story about humanity, this is the book for you. I can't believe it took me 10 + years to finally read it. I'm proud to have finished it before the movie comes out!<br />Having the Kindle version was wonderful. I have the app for both my iPhone and my iPad. If I stop reading on one device, I can pick up right where I left off on the other.
B003TZCFR4|5.0|I adore Madeleine Peyrox's sound, it is a little retro yet very now.  Cannot wait ot purchase her other CD's.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Love, love, love this movie. We're huge fans of the Lord of the Rings trilogy and felt that The Hobbit fit in beautifully with those, in terms of look/feel as well as story. Perfect dovetailing -- in fact, it makes you want to go watch the others to pick up on the references! Gorgeous movie, very entertaining and fine performances. We've rented it twice from Amazon Instant, which says a lot considering how cheap we are -- ha. Highly recommended. Can't wait to see the next &#34;Hobbit&#34; movie!
B0095MVOMC|5.0|Love this game! Very addicting and a great little time passer! The graphics in the background scenery are just awesome, I could get lost in them and forget about the #'s I'm looking for!
B009Y7YC2M|1.0|This app doesn't even work and I payed 3.95 for it! DO NOT BUY! You would be dissapointed like me!
B00BTJMS1A|4.0|I was looking for puzzle quest style game on android This is the only one I known so far. Honestly,.the game may annoy you at first with constant easy deaths and mostly grindfest aspect, but the game is built around you dying and continually gaining gold, resources, and experience to earn higher ranks and better scores. You will die often, but you're not supposed to win all at once. I did have to wrestle a bit sliding tiles, which sometimes will lead to semi-cheap deaths. I'm not sure this an issue of the game,  or smartphone touchscreen interface. Still, I haven't seen any alternative for this genre on android, and it becomes more fun the more you play.
B004DNWPY4|5.0|I would be a lot better off now if I had the advice in this book early on in my career.  Everything is so true.  My training at university did not prepare me for life in the outside world.  The book is very easy reading and one of the best kindle books I have bought.
B00CE6E6B2|1.0|I thought this game would be good because I love to build stuff but it was terrible. DON'T BUY! It is boring!
B000SJ9N1K|5.0|Critically panned, as most of the albums were, this is one of my favorites.  Very good mix of styles and, as Mr. Page said, ''So there's some buggers who don't like [the album]. Good luck to 'em. I like it, and a few thousand other buggers too.''
B0078ZTWP4|1.0|This looks and feels close to the 4W green one with the same features I have made by someone else.  I'm game to try new things, and thought I might save a couple bucks with this one.  Sometimes when we try new things they work out and sometimes they flop.  This one FLOPPED......<br /><br />The first one showed up and worked fine with good light output compared to the green one (I found the light output of both on high very good, by the way, and about equal), BUT the low light setting flickered badly - guaranteed to give ya a headache.  Plus, knowing electronics - if it is flickering now, it will likely fail completely later.  NOT good for an emergency light.  If I needed this in a survival setting, I would already have quite a headache and be irritated enough, thank you.  If camping and trying to relax, this would be highly irritating.  :)<br /><br />Soooooooo, thinking this was a fluke, I promptly packed it up to return to Amazon, and went and bought a second one from Amazon.  It showed up fast, though packing left something to be desired, BUT when brand new batteries were installed it did NOTHING.  Nothing.  I made positive the batteries were installed the right way, and even tried the wrong way.  NOTHING.  I tested the 3 batteries and all 3 had excellent charges.<br /><br />SO this one showed up with a DOA circuit board and was only useful for a paper weight.  Nice.<br /><br />Back to Amazon with TWO of these, with the customary North Atlantic merchant vessel crew creative language - while taking the time to re-pack/tape/label and get to UPS, AND the return shipping costs, AND being disappointed in the same product TWICE in a row.  NO MORE of these for me.  Back to the green one at just $3 more as of today.<br /><br />Sometimes a bargain isn't.
B003G4W49C|5.0|It has all been said before. What a crafted balanced story with hidden surprises looking at adults manipulating Ender from the age of 6 on. What a strong character Orson Scott Card has developed with a central core of intellectual strength and compassion. A character who is a great vechile for thought provoking comments linked to relationships with those around and responding to challenges.
B00004TS0E|5.0|WOW This is my favorite Christmas movie ever,I love the actors  and the photography. I watch it every year !
B009NY43NY|3.0|The thoughts on this book was that it was rushed together. It was too much to end so quickly! Charlaine you should really write one more book!<br />I was hoping that this book would have ended with eric being able to be with sookie and not having to be with the other vampire. I love Sam but the relationship started up so quickly. Same was like a whole new character in this book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a brilliant game and it has a lot of different characters and obcicles in and when you have money you have an opportunity to buy skateboards or upgrade on you items that are used in the run its a great to play when your alone and when your bored I would recommend this game to everyone with an iPhone,iPod,iPad and others it's a good game .<br /><br />download it now.
034580404X|5.0|I can't  say enough about this book !!! You wont want to put this book down, and when you are finished you will read it again and again and again !!!
B002BU0DPE|1.0|Worked great for about 6 months, then one of the ear speakers just stopped working. After dealing with the hassle to get authorization for a warranty repair, I got a \\"new\\" set three weeks later. The new set they sent me broke, both speakers this time in less than 60 days. Long story short, I own a nice, expensive paperweight, and it isn't really good at that either.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|hey everyone I'm 13 and this game is like so fun if I was really board I can play this game n it lightens my mood right up I just fell it's a h<br />great game
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|This is really unfortunate but this series just fizzled in a major way for me.  Eva is very unattractive in the way she behaves.  Slutty.  Gideon is better than her and this whole storyline has totally jumped the shark for me.  Too much drama, too long to wait for a finished story, too much money grubbing by the author.  Cooked, fried and done with Crossfire.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|Only 15 minutes make the full version free please !One more thing needs furniture also let us choose our gender I hate being a guy

B0058SNI94|3.0|We have had very warm temps lately and I have worn them around the house.  Your feet will sweat as expected.  Fine for just running around doing errands.  They are comfortable but really nothing great.<br />Update to plastic croc.  Spent a weekend in them walking around NY City.  I didn't want to wear sneakers or flip flops.  Wanted shoes that would be comfortable and pull a casual outfit together.  Very surprised how comfortable they were.  Very light worked out very well.  I thought that I would have blisters from them or the moisture ( sweating wasn't that bad) and I had none.  I did get a few marks from the plastic which went away fast and didn't hurt.  There is some \\"Shoe fart\\" issues.  I got over that real fast because my feet were comfortable and I really didn't care if strangers heard my feet fart.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Better than the AMC series. If yours into the series read the comic books. They tell a great story and give it a gritty feel and your imagination a surge
B007PVHMCG|5.0|this is a great product for lego and minecraft fans its all micro and very detailed i hate to advertise but if you want to see a video review go to youtube and go to my channel 360firedude to see a detailed review it comes with a steve (2) and a creeper its just perfect i would highly recomend it and theres caves inside very detailed
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|It's too late for me to type a detailed review, but I just had to say this album is blowing me away right now. (Been listening to it for about an hour.) It is so damn good! The range and diversity of the songs is as great as any of their albums. It still rocks, but contains more pensive times than you might expect. These just make it better! And finally, there's a rare polish on here. Maybe an experienced confidence showing Josh has learned to take everything he's learned to craft exactly what he's looking for.<br /><br />I can't say enough good things about this after first listen. If you like QotSA, don't hesitate to get this. If you're new to the band or on the fence, sample the songs here first. It'll be worth it!
B001SGEUMY|5.0|So it's 2005 and I'm standing in Tower Records when a song comes over the store speakers.<br />I think, \\"This sounds good.\\"<br />Then I think, \\"This sounds familiar\\".<br />Then I realize, \\"I own this.\\"<br />Then I realize it is `Part Of The Queue.'<br />Then I remember, \\"I don't like this.\\"<br />Then I realize, \\"But this sounds good.\\"<br /><br />Then the sixties stomper `Meaning Of Soul' starts playing.<br />I think, \\"This sounds good.\\"<br />Then I remember, \\"I don't like this.\\"<br />Then I realize, \\"But this sounds good.\\"<br /><br />Yes, even the bad songs are good.<br /><br />But you don't have to believe me. \\"Don't Believe The Truth\\" went straight to #1, becoming the 32nd fastest selling album in UK history. Popular vote placed it as the 14th best British album of all time.<br /><br />And what about the B sides? Gem's `Eyeball Tickler' and Liam's `Won't Let You Down' and `Pass Me Down The Wine' are all top notch.<br /><br />\\"Don't Believe The Truth\\" literally sounds like it came right out of 1966. It all sounds familiar. That's because these guys are so good at channeling the sounds of the past into something new and exciting. And this one is retro right from the start.<br /><br />Turn it up for everyone.<br />`Turn Up The Sun' sounds like you turned the transistor radio on during the mid sixties. Sounding traditional and fresh at the same time, it is tight and condensed. Where before they would have gone on much longer, here they seem to end the song in mid stream. But it is effective in its message. Love one another.<br /><br />Look in that mirror.<br />`Mucky Fingers'. A sixties beer joint rock and roller. Sounds like something that would have been playing everywhere every night at least once.<br /><br />She's the Queen of all I've seen.<br />`Lyla'. What great rock and roll is all about. Powerful and catchy. Driving hard, it just pushes the sound at you.  Listen to that Liam sneer. This song was the last recorded, and it was recorded to be the single. It too went right to #1.<br /><br />Blowing my mind.<br />`Love Like A Bomb'. Put on one of those sixties beach party movies and you are ready to go. A hippie pop love song played groovy fast, it pulls you along on the rip tide of its relentless beat.<br /><br />Son... words fail me.<br />`The Importance Of Being Idle'. Pure British excellence. It's the beat. Uncompromising, pompous beat. Once again, familiar and catchy as hell. It too became a single and went immediately to #1.<br /><br />I dig what you say.<br />`The Meaning Of Soul'. A foot stomping, hand clapping rocking the floor boards quick run of a song. It seems that in their design for this album they decided to make a rocking record using folk guitars. And they achieved it nicely.<br /><br />No one could break us.<br />`Guess God Thinks I'm Able'. Acoustic head bopping. The bad boy calls his brother Cain.<br /><br />Stand tall, stand proud.<br />`Part Of The Queue'. Another driving acoustic number. These guys are ripping. Powerful stuff before we even get to the electric lead. Pianos too roll through this album more than once.<br /><br />Where real life and dreams collide.<br />`Keep The Dream Alive'. In an album full of classics, this may be the most beautiful. The song for everyone.<br /><br />And all will be brand new.<br />`A Bell Will Ring'.  Welcome to the Revolver album. Yes that's Ringo's kid over there on drums, sounding just like Dad. Like the song before it, this ripper shows that the Gallagher's knew what they were doing when they brought in these two new guitarists, as they seem to effortlessly write in the Oasis style. You will find yourself shaking your head to this tune. Yes, it's fun to be a kid again.<br /><br />The world is waiting for you.<br />`Let There Be Love'. Now we're going to let John sing us one. Yoko must be in the room, because the feelings the same. Simplicity at work here. Like plaintive Lennon, this song ends it all with simple understated feeling.<br /><br />This is one of thenew century's great rock and roll albums. It demands to be played LOUD. Turn it up! Turn it up for everyone!new century's great rock and roll albums. It demands to be played LOUD. Turn it up! Turn it up for everyone!

0765325950|2.0|So disappointed. Agree with all the negative comments. Way too much battle - who cares? I slogged through it. Way too little about main characters. And who were these Sharans anyway? Never mentioned before - created just for the finale.  And all the other new characters never heard of before?  And did not like Tam not knowing the ending, nor Nyneave, Lan, Moraine and Thom. All these major characters should have known about  the final surprise. Why would Rand let his father grieve when not necessary. BAD ending! Bad endless repetitive battle. Plus my book fell apart after  page 158,  literally, glue failed. Just a metaphor for the book no doubt.
B00008G8LM|5.0|This review is for the original version.The transfer to disc is a 4 out of 5,the story line is great,great acting,and great casting.The movie is a fun,funny,and a tear jerker.Excellent family film....support your favorite artists.
B007REV4T8|1.0|Just another bad action comic book movie geared to teenagers.  The actors in these movies could be replaced with people off the street, I see no reason for even a director, nothing to direct, dialogue is the same in all these movies,what there is of it.  Griegs face is a rock in all his movies, a good tough guy movie with substance is what he needs, not this junk.
B00AZM7IQC|5.0|If you never watched a cirque show then please move on. The quote i hear most is &#34; this guy must be on something&#34;  I have seen 3 shows and this movie is just as good because unlike the show you can watch it again and again for stuff you miss. Live show have about 1000000 things going on at once and the human mind only can focus on 3 things.  Plus you get to see views that you can not see in the show.<br />I would suggest going to a show first if possible.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Would highly recommend it.  Held our interest the entire time.  Ben Affleck did a great job in both directing and acting.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I love temple run 2 and I have it on my Samsung Galaxy s4. However I was dissapointed by the sound FX and graphics on my kindle fire. The graphics look like sandpaper and the sound of collecting coins sounds more like gunshots than anything else. Also it is difficult to maneuver it through the tunnels and narrow paths in the game. If you have a tablet I wouldn't recommend it. Instead get it on your phone if you want high quality.<br /><br />Well, at least it's free&hellip;
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great and very addicting let me warn you great fun for everyone and free too great colourful atmosphere
B008IJT0CE|5.0|even the nights when I'm the most rest and restless this app helps me fall asleep quickly and easily. I had the free version and I had been considering upgrading so I could have it open in the background and to have more options for the sounds. I saw that it was the free app of the day and I couldn't pass it up.
B0091REZMW|3.0|?x<br /><br />i like hidden objects games but this is not the best i have played. too much items to do to get to the game.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|there should be a free version of this game.<br />there is a free version of everything else so with all do respect there should be for this game.why, because this game is awsome so there should be no restrictions.

B005M0VQVA|5.0|In a nutshell, Billy Elliot is an inspirational film about a talented boy that wants to be a professional ballerina set amidst a miners' strike during Thatcher's era in Northern England. The movie is fairly typical of inspirational films and follows the formula closely, but it feels neither over dramatized nor does it end predictably. I was so sure that the film was either a biopic (it isn't) or an adaptation (guess again) because of the multidimensional characters and writhing backdrop of players and politics. Two actors are worthy of special mention: Gary Lewis plays Billy's father, Jackie Elliot, with such an incredible range of seething emotions that he never once falls into an archetypal role or stereotype. Jackie is a lifelong miner with a narrow world view, so when he sees Billy dancing for the first time,  the expected anger is there, but it shares equal space and time in his actions and eyes with fear and guilt. Fear, perhaps, that his son may be ridiculed, that he may not have raised him right, and guilt because his deceased wife, Billy's mother, was a music lover and dancer, passions that Jackie does not or will not share after her passing. The other actor, Jamie Draven, playing Jackie's elder son, Tony, seems like a one-trick pony, a reckless youth propelled through the film by punk music. Yet it's a disingenuous performance from the character, a small town tough exaggerating the act but crumbling under emotional strain many times, when his father fails to meet his expectations, when he discovers Billy's predilection for ballet, when Billy leaves.    I admit that I wouldn't normally choose to watch a film about a 10-year-old ballerina, male or female, but was compelled to by my wife. It has become a permanent part of our collection and though I may still not reach for it before, say, Hot Tub Time Machine or Dark City, I watch it without griping, enraptured by the nuanced performances, funky soundtrack, and, admittedly, as an Anglophile, getting my fix however I can.    For those who care, it doesn't pass the Bechdel Test, and I'd recommend that if you're not comfortable with your sexuality, give it a pass, as there's a bit of boy kissing. Roll your eyes elsewhere. Conversely, if your response is \\"Who gives a s***?\\" then proceed.    This particular release is bare bones but the presentation is good.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I wasn't sure I would be able to keep reading at first but the character really pulls you into his world.  I haven't seen the move.
B005FITILO|4.0|In Young Adult, Mavis Gary has led a successful life as a YA ghostwriter, but after receiving a blanket e-mail about her high school boyfriend's newborn daughter, she returns to her hometown, Mercury (like, totally, a whole `nother planet y'all), to steal him back. On the wind, her life spirals out of control, as she misses her book deadlines, begins drinking (it is hinted, not for the first time), crashes her rental, and spews profanity and hate wherever she goes. Ultimately, Mavis's story deals with pathos rather than her ex, choices she has made, and the inevitability of her life, your life, all lives, surging forward heedless of the benefits of hindsight.<br />Charlize Theron is amazing as Mavis and my favorite performer, playing a truly reprehensible character for much of the film, while Patrick Wilson plays her ex-boyfriend, Buddy, as competently Good Guy as he does in most of his roles, leaving Patton Oswalt to provide the sympathy and also embody the weakest part of the script.<br />Oswalt is Matt Freehauf, one of Mavis's former classmates that never managed to leave Mercury, primarily because of the severe beating and resulting disability he received in high school when a rumor floated that he was gay (he isn't). I love this character. His life is richly detailed but each element - his disability, his endearing nerdy hobby, his potentially money-making hobby, the night(s) he spends with Mavis - could easily be replaced with something more familiar or nostalgic to any individual member of the audience, creating a wish fulfilment cypher that automatically invokes trust in the viewer. Because of this and despite Oswalt's terrific performance, Matt also has more in common with the Friendly Native, the Magical Negro, Jiminy Cricket, Clarence the Angel, or even Scruff McGruff the Crime Dog than a real human being. He speaks for Mavis's conscience and to voice the audience's nagging critiques of her behavior, then later provides a safe place for her to unravel inthe third act, leaving me with the nagging suspicion that he isn't real, and the artificial reality of the film breaks down.<br />There is a turn at the end. Mavis is humiliated but still loved, which shames her into confronting those things about herself that she doesn't like. But then, on the precipice of realization, at the summit of her character arc, her selfish behavior and callousness are reinforced and she leaves much the way she arrived. The ending is all the more believable for this, though no less depressing.<br /><br />This film is difficult for me to justify adding to your collection because of the Matt Freehauf character, though it contrasts nicely with Take This Waltz, an equally depressing film also about lost young people, albeit on slightly more optimistic paths. But it isn't nearly as overwritten as Diablo Cody's last venture, Jennifer's Body, and the realistic portrayals of 30-something social dysfunction, the comedic beats, and even the satirically turned out wish fulfilment fantasies - landing the prettiest girl in town or returning to your hometown, sophisticated and wealthy - make it worth the shelf space to me. I may grow tired of Young Adult (though I haven't yet), or mature out of its influence, but until I do, I own it, and you might as well give it a watch.<br /><br />For those who care, it doesn't pass the Bechdel Test, and those adverse to naughty language or horrible people might want to give it a pass.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray release has some special features, the highlight of which were the deleted scenes, likely cut for time.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Got this for my husband for Christmas.  It's his favorite movie! We even watch it in the car when traveling. I like it because I can listen to the sound and know what's going on - I don't have to see it on the screen.

Yet it's a disingenuous performance from the character, a small town tough exaggerating the act but crumbling under emotional strain many times, when his father fails to meet his expectations, when he discovers Billy's predilection for ballet, when Billy leaves.<br /><br />I admit that I wouldn't normally choose to watch a film about a 10-year-old ballerina, male or female, but was compelled to by my wife. It has become a permanent part of our collection and though I may still not reach for it before, say, Hot Tub Time Machine or Dark City, I watch it without griping, enraptured by the nuanced performances, funky soundtrack, and, admittedly, as an Anglophile, getting my fix however I can.<br /><br />For those who care, it doesn't pass the Bechdel Test, and I'd recommend that if you're not comfortable with your sexuality, give it a pass, as there's a bit of boy kissing. Roll your eyes elsewhere. Conversely, if your response is \\"Who gives a s***?\\" then proceed.<br /><br />This particular release is bare bones but the presentation is good.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|I was skeptical at first, but I love Don Miguel Ruiz's style of writing.  This book has changed my life for the better.  I plan to read a few hundred times more.  I've purchased this copy as a gift to a special friend.
B000AOLT38|5.0|In a nutshell, Billy Elliot is an inspirational film about a talented boy that wants to be a professional ballerina set amidst a miners' strike during Thatcher's era in Northern England. The movie is fairly typical of inspirational films and follows the formula closely, but it feels neither over dramatized nor does it end predictably. I was so sure that the film was either a biopic (it isn't) or an adaptation (guess again) because of the multidimensional characters and writhing backdrop of players and politics. Two actors are worthy of special mention: Gary Lewis plays Billy's father, Jackie Elliot, with such an incredible range of seething emotions that he never once falls into an archetypal role or stereotype. Jackie is a lifelong miner with a narrow world view, so when he sees Billy dancing for the first time,  the expected anger is there, but it shares equal space and time in his actions and eyes with fear and guilt. Fear, perhaps, that his son may be ridiculed, that he may not have raised him right, and guilt because his deceased wife, Billy's mother, was a music lover and dancer, passions that Jackie does not or will not share after her passing. The other actor, Jamie Draven, playing Jackie's elder son, Tony, seems like a one-trick pony, a reckless youth propelled through the film by punk music. Yet it's a disingenuous performance from the character, a small town tough exaggerating the act but crumbling under emotional strain many times, when his father fails to meet his expectations, when he discovers Billy's predilection for ballet, when Billy leaves.

B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Okay so, I was one of the angry reviewers that could not believe that this Trilogy was suddenly turning into a five part series.  I am revising my previous angry review because Sylvia has reached out to her fans and explained the circumstances behind the changes.  Sometimes dealing with publishers is not all that great.  I wish Sylvia the best, but I would like to suggest that she does not work with this publisher once her contract is up.  They obviously did not have her best interest at heart.<br /><br />With that said I loved all of the twists and turns that this book has taken.  I cannot wait for Gideon and Eva to find their happily ever after (they soo deserve it). I think that the suspense in this book is what makes it so great.  Keep them coming please (HOPEFULLY NOT 6 MONTHS FROM NOW)
B001D8W7CW|5.0|Got this on Blu ray so of course i love it even more so now. Will always be a a classic movie in my eyes.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Original. Imaginative. Page turner. This is what fiction is supposed to look like. Unexpected developments. Suspense. Thriller. Characters you care about.
B00CRS5HII|4.0|Not a bad country album but personally liked his earlier stuff better. This album is a bit slower and more traditional country than the others but is still a good album. If you like country and want to stay away from the usual stuff that is pushed by the commercial junk that is on the radio all the time this is something you may want to add.
B00CS7ZIHI|5.0|As usual for me 30 Seconds To Mars doesn't disappoint. It definitely has a more electronic sound, not a bad thing in my opinion. Its just different. I have listened to the album now probably 10 to 15 times on continuous play and I can say there isnt anything I didnt like.
B009P14EK2|4.0|Overall it is another good example of a different era in rock there seems to be one bad thing about this album and it may have been mentioned in another review and if so maybe I should have read the reviews. But when adding to my Mp3 player could not transfer the whole album. The last half is blocked and IMO that kind of ruins the whole album as far as road trips go. Something not all will find a problem but it can make the difference in the decision to purchase the album or not.
B002N5N4MG|5.0|Love the cast they put together for this show. They gel very well and are a joy to watch and laugh at. The material is very funny because for some reason it just resonates with me. Good stuff.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|It's truly great to see a band like this keep true to what their known for the best! ALICE IN CHAINS really bring their grungy crush, groove, and stomp attack back into high form with this 2013 effort! Just got the album and yes a few tracks need more than one listen especially with some of the odd Jurassic sounds heard in some of the mix! Overall, nothing is stinking or sinking into the La Brea Tarp Pits here INMOP! From start to finish, everything rocks angry-hard & heavy or grooves mid-tempo with some cool and passionate acoustic/rocking rhythms the boys have done before. Great dual vocals from Jerry C. and William D.(Not Layne S., RIP.)/still sounds as close as possible to several of their previous works! Again, fantastic musicianship all around! Bottom line, ALICE IN CHAINS remain way more consistent with their signature sound unlike Soundgarden or the confused STP.! This Alice definitely smash their chains with a vengeance for TDPDH.! Go get this one!
B00BSWMITK|2.0|Nothing new here. BORING.Better off getting Black Swan and Wormhole Wizards. Not even different set of musicans help this. Momentum stopped.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This is a real boom that you can not put down. I loved it! The only thing is that some part I did not really understand but I absolutely recommend this book.
B00005N6KG|4.0|These headphones are fine and the sound is pretty decent. But the cord is a bit on the shorter side, compared to other headphones. I run with these and when you get sweaty they do not stay on as well. I think it wouldnt hurt to add some sort of plastic grip over the inner ear buds. They are lightweight which is nice. Overall not bad, i use them for running and even they fall out a bit, they do the job, especially for the price, decent deal.

B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Just I was starting to get bored with the romance between Sky and Holder, the twist came along and captured my attention again. Overall, it wasn't bad, but wasn't my favorite either. The romance scenes were a little too long winded for me, when the plot was strong enough on its own.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Wonderful source of ideas! Enjoy a LOT!! Share with family and friends many ideas, have research many of the ideas and those who post them.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I am hearing nothing on if the story was good or not (I have not yet read it, it is waiting for me at home). I WILL NOT return the book just because I am mad that there are two more books rather then three. Am I hearing it right that people are writing a bad review because they are disappointed that there are two more books? Is that really fare to the author? I have yet to read real cons to why I should not read the book.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|This is a good series. It keep me and my family glued to the television for the duration of the episode. We look forward to what season two will reveal and how it will entertain us.
0743277465|5.0|Have read a lot of books on how to get ahead in business and career including the 4-Hour work week and all of the Malcolm Gladwell books (Outliers, Blink, What the Dog Saw...). This book was the most helpful. Josh goes into a lot of the nitty-gritty about what it means to compete at the most competitive levels. This helped me make better decisions about where to focus my efforts and what things I did and did not consider to be a waste of time.<br /><br />While the book seems to have gotten an overall high rating, I did notice that there were a few scathing reviews by people who hated the book. Based on the content of the reviews and my own experience hiring people who are great competitors and firing people who are not: my guess is that most of the negative reviews are coming from people who are angered to find out two things:<br />1) The amount of pain and failure it takes to get to the top.<br />2) The realization that the primary drive to get to the top needs to come from an intrinsic love of competition and your chosen discipline; not from the extrinsic desire to be admired.

B00CW665VI|4.0|What a refreshing and FUN read! Seriously! This story is told COMPLETELY from Drew's POV. And man is he crude and tell you like it is. It starts out in the future. Drew is a mess. He smells, is unshaven, and has not appeared to moved from his couch in a week. Drew calls this the flu. But let's be honest. Drew is really just heartbroken. Because for all his womanizing ways (and hey, this entire story was inspired by the song Womanizer), Drew has finally fallen in love.<br /><br />Drew's tone is HILARIOUS. I don't think I can emphasize it enough. He is so cocky, so crude, and so real. He tells you like it is, no balls about it. What you see is what you get. And he is so unapologetic about it. Till the very last word in this whole book. He speaks in awesome metaphors that actually make a LOT of sense and are pretty perfect each of the scenarios he describes, but so crude that I don't think I myself could ever try explaining them to anyone else. This story is not about Drew growing up, getting over himself, and learning humility. Drew Evans does not know humility nor does he want to know humility. I absolutely loved this. If there was ever a character's \\"tone\\" you would remember, it would be Drew Evans. He is just so damn kickass and sometimes a douche and knows it.<br /><br />But while Drew's character might be the strength of the book, I also saw it as the book's weakness. We get SO much of Drew in this book. I feel like I know him SO well. But when I really stop to think of it, I don't really feel like I know Kate that well, and there was even a point in this story where I kind of missed our good ole female protagonist POV. Because man, does Drew think about sex a lot. Almost too much? I don't know but I found myself wanting Kate's POV instead at times.<br /><br />My only other criticism about this book is the unrealistic component to their careers. Investment banks have MDs, not Partners. And an incoming MBA new-hire would be at the Associate level, not treated as aMD, regardless of how good you are or how much potential you have. And they would not be afforded that much responsibility for putting together pitches for new deals. Investment banking is, if not anything else, extremely hierarchical. Even if it's a boutique firm, and especially if it's a top boutique. But excuse me while I just nerd out for a bit here. Other parts of the job were actually described pretty well, so props for that.<br /><br />All in all though this was a great story. A light read too! Especially because although Drew is obviously heartbroken in this book (thus the flu) it's almost a relief that the story is told from his POV because it makes the whole \\"separation\\" a lot lighter as Drew tries to win Kate back. I wouldn't necessarily compare it to Wallbanger as I had originally heard, other than that it is on the more humorous side, as is Wallbanger, and that the back-and-forth banter between Drew and Kate is awesome (though I still favor Wallbanger), but it's a great story all on its own.<br /><br />And excuse me... did I read something about a Tangled #2??? Perhaps called Twisted? I wonder what this might be about but I'm excited already.
0440243661|1.0|I've enjoyed a few Jack Reacher adventures by Child but this novel is slow and very boring.  I tried to get through the book but had to put it down around the fourth chapter.  Very disappointing.
0425263924|1.0|What a let down,bought the kindle version so it is not even as if I can get my money back.Thin story line and very much felt that this book was all about stretching out the series to make an extra buck.I thought that it was badly written with repetitive phrases and the constant \\"Angel\\" this and \\"Ace\\" that began to annoy me.Sorry but I am done with Eva and Gideon.
0425263924|5.0|WE GET MORE GIDEON!!!!  As difficult as the wait will be, for the next book, I have no doubt Sylvia Day will make it worth our while.<br /><br />Reading about Gideon and Eva provokes such stirring emotions in me.  Isn't that what a book should do?  I had planned to wait a couple days to read this on a long flight.  I really tried.  I couldn't do it, and the result was only 3.5 hours of sleep.  Totally worth it.  Ms. Day's writing  captures my heart and mind  in a way that truly brings her characters to life in front of my eyes.  Please don't listen to naysayers who are upset about more books.  Just be grateful there is a writer out there like Sylvia Day, to provide them.
B00BTLOOAQ|5.0|I heard one snippet on NPR and I was hooked, immediately finding and buying. I can't actually say I'm a fan of jazz. Perhaps jazz vocals but not necessarily jazz itself. This is a perfect crossover for people like me, who don't know much but know what they like. And I like this, a lot. I know from the NPR piece that she (and musician Aaron Diehl who plays piano) is a young in age. Despite youth, there is such depth and maturity to the vocals and the music.
B00A8V3VVG|5.0|Well first off, it's a Quentin Tarantino soundtrack so it's gotta be good, and it is! It's a great variety of music and very pleasing to the ears. No matter your musical tastes, you are bound to find at least one track on here that you will love. Even if none of these tracks are fitting to your musical tastes, you will appreciate them because there is such a powerful connection between the music and film.<br /><br />Love it. Cheers!
B0002EXH5E|5.0|People can say that this is Dave Mustaine's &#34;sell-out&#34; record but I disagree. With songs like &#34;Prince of Darkness&#34;, &#34;Time: The End&#34;, & the opening track &#34;Insomnia&#34; this album is a fitting end to what the '90's were. Fans should give a second listen to this album, and give tracks like &#34;Breadline&#34;, &#34;The Doctor is Calling&#34; & &#34;Wanderlust&#34; a chance. Too often musicians get a bad perception for failure to &#34;change&#34; with the times. Well, nobody can say that Dave Mustaine isn't or hasn't been willing to try different things when it comes to a Megadeth record. This is a good one, if people are willing to give it a chance.

B00CY1JUW2|4.0|Of the many bands returning from hiatus in 2013, Queens of the Stone Age seem to be one of the biggest beneficiaries from taking some time off. Before the break, the band found themselves in a creative spiral that saw them losing members and losing stature, and it sounded like they were losing their minds. Their previous album, 2007's Era Vulgaris, boasted some notable experiments, but it fell flat because they seemed to be more interested in tinkering with an exotic sound than they were with delivering solid craftsmanship. Six years later, singer/guitarist Josh Homme has retooled his approach and now delivers the most ambitious Queens record since their glory days.<br /><br />It contains all of the necessary elements to make a successful record. The instrumentation is great -- there's fertile drumwork with lots of off time fills and complex passages. The guitar work is impressive. Some leads really jump out and demand your attention, while others are more subtle and affect you in ways you may not realize until you've spun the disc several times. For his part, Homme once again shows his value as a consummate everyman vocalist. His performances are always great, but the arrangements are simple enough that the average Joe can easily pick it up and sing along. That generally remains the case here, but Homme gets more of a workout than usual, which allows the band to explore some different directions.<br /><br />To pigeonhole Queens of the Stone Age as a mere rock band would be a mistake. Unlike some of their earlier material, this album is not all rock all the time; Homme cleverly structures each song to include a vast array of sounds and styles. There are dark, moody ballads, up tempo tunes with soul and swagger, and plenty of high energy rockers as well.<br /><br />\\"Keep Your Eyes Peeled\\" opens the album on an ominous and dissonant note; with its acidic guitar riff and sense of unease it bears similarity to \\"Turnin' on the Screw\\" from Era Vulgaris, but the complex drumming, appropriately fuzzy bass and Homme's haunting vocal quickly makes it clear this is a different beast.<br /><br />The eerie downtempo ballad \\"Vampyre of Time and Memory\\" operates in a similar musical neighborhood, though this one starts out slow and minimalist while slowly but surely building up to a clear catharsis. It's a theme the album seems fond of exploring; in this case it manifests itself by concluding with some spacey and wigged out guitar work.<br /><br />In terms of straight ahead rockers, \\"I Sat by the Ocean\\" is easily the catchiest, and is the track most likely to put a smile on your face. Homme shows off a wide range here as he weaves a tale of trying to forget about an old flame. His upper register vocals inject a swaggering sense of groove into the music, while the crunching guitars recall the glory of 70s rock and roll. It is guaranteed to get your foot tapping and your body moving.<br /><br />And make no mistake -- when it comes to swagger, this record delivers in heavy doses. \\"Smooth Sailing\\" is very funk, groove and soul oriented, and it plays out like Homme asserting his claim to sex god status. It never lacks for braggadocio, as he asserts that he'll \\"make a mountain out of a molehill if the molehill is mine.\\" If that's not enough, he also declares that he'll \\"blow his load over the status quo.\\" Sexy or just eww? You be the judge.<br /><br />Elsewhere, \\"Kalopsia\\" provides a stoned, drug induced haze of gentle serene relaxation which is broken up by a buzzy bedroom guitar riff during the main refrain. \\"Like a Tail,\\" meanwhile, features some half scat/made up words from Homme during the lead in, and slowly grooves its way to a hard rocking conclusion.<br /><br />As far as the much ballyhooed guest spots on the album go -- Trent Reznor, Mark Lanegan, Nick Oliveri, and Alex Turner of The Arctic Monkeys all make appearances -- the fact is you likely wouldn't notice any of them if you didn't know they were playing on the track beforehand. Theband keeps their signature sound intact by donwplaying the role of guests on the album.<br /><br />Of all of them, Elton's John's guest spot on \\"Fairweather Friends\\" is the most notable. Many songs on this album seem to start off slowly and then try to blow you away with a heavy riff, and this one is no exception. But this is perhaps one of the most fully formed songs on the album. Homme delivers his best performance on the album with his uplifting vocal. There are great rock riffs paired with plenty of winding and weaving guitar leads and solos pepper the song's landscape. Dave Grohl provides energetic drumming with lots of rolls and fills that open up possibilities for the rest of the band, and Elton John's piano work fits in so naturally with the rest of the mix that one would be hard pressed to imagine the track without it.<br /><br />Yet in spite of the breakthroughs made on this album, some factors do hold it back. There is an over reliance on the method of opening a song with a quiet, downbeat intro only to build to a louder or more dramatic conclusion. There's nothing wrong with that approach, but the extent to which the band utilizes it here leads to a case of diminishing results as the album progresses. The penultimate track, \\"I Appear Missing,\\" drifts back and forth between the whole quiet/loud dynamic as each verse gives way into the chorus. A handful of other songs, including \\"Kalopsia,\\" \\"If I Had a Tail,\\" and \\"Vampyre of Memory of Time\\" leans on this technique in some form or fashion.<br /><br />This insistence on tempering the heavy rocking sections with those that are more subtle or quiet causes it to often feel like the band is trying to hold themselves back from rocking too hard. They tip toe around the rock on many of these songs, and it's hard to not wish for them to cut loose a little more often. It's fine to dabble in creative experiments but rock is one of the things Queens of the Stone do best, and sometimes it feels like they forget that.<br/><br />However, it's all for a good purpose. There are albums released this year which would hold more appeal for a fan of heavy rock, or someone looking for something intense. But Like Clockwork exercises more creativity than most of those records, along with a greater sense of variety. With this savory cornucopia they've delivered up, Queens of the Stone Age show their aim is to transcend the notion of being a mere rock band. It's a concept that bears a great deal of merit in its own right.

B00CTSDDVO|5.0|My dads the big fan, ive seen many of the movies, but its much more his thing than mine, with that said i enjoyed this movie alot, when they started the series over again with the first Star Trek movie i seen and enjoyed it, this one essentially picks up where that one left off, im not goint to throw any spoilers out there, but do want to say those that are complaining about lousy acting or a bad plot ? I disagree. the visuals were A-1 FANTASTIC ! and the story was pretty believable. This new set of movies isnt following the old one to a T and i think thats great, new stories or variations for a new generation. My dad went on and on about all the old cues from the old movies that were injected into this one (although i dont know them) he sure did pick up on them.  For the die hard fans of the movies i think you either going to love it or hate it depending on perspective and what you expecting to take out of it.. for others like me that are just enjoying a great sci-fi movie, this new star treck series of movies is very good.

B00ATUEKY8|4.0|In my opinion, Sylvia Plath accurately portrays a young and depressed woman through Esther. Plath has a way of manipulating simple diction in a way that allows the reader to easily empathize with Esther. Whether you suffer from depression or simply have the blues, this book will immediately tug at your heartstrings.<br /> My favorite aspect of this novel was Plath's humorous and witty ways of describing Esther's depression. Esther's pulls me into a poisonous fog bank, but simultaneously I am comforted to know that I am not alone in this darkness. Plath is clear and concise throughout the novel which is how the reader can really get into the inner workings of Esther's mind. I believe one either loves or hates this novel, depending on how much one can empathize for Esther. Although this is the case, I think every reader can take something valuable from it. Perhaps one will value one's life more while another may feel reassured that one is not alone. Plath depicts a widely common mental illness through Esther in a funny yet serious tone.<br /> Plath breaks down depression for the layman, but the-matter-of-fact is it's a frustrating topic. Depression \\"isn't always something you can fight back against with hope. It isn't even something -- it's nothing. And you can't combat nothing. You can't fill it up. You can't cover it. It's just there, pulling the meaning out of everything. That being the case, all the hopeful, proactive solutions start to sound completely insane in contrast to the scope of the problem\\" (hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com). Plath's depiction of a depressed young college student allows for both depressed and undepressed readers to further understand the illness.

0307730697|4.0|From the start the story is not so extraordinary, but hang on and keep reading !<br />This work by Eric Blehm should be recommended in every drug addict rehabilitation center, to all who doubt their faith, to all who feel like being lost, to all who suffer for chronic painful disorders, and finally to all women planning to establish a family with military men.<br />It is truly sad, that Adam lost his precious life due to never ending war and turmoil in Afghanistan.
0060853972|3.0|I found Good Omens to be truly entertaining.  Five stars on Aziraphale and Crowley alone.  My only disappointment is the Kindle format.  There are many footnotes within the story, but you have to surf to the back of the book to read them...and try to find your way back.  Either Kindle needs to be reprogrammed so you can touch the * and go to the corresponding note and then back, or the publisher just needs to include the text on the associated page.<br /><br />I suggest you read this book!  Just buy it in paper format and skip the electronic version.

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I normally do not write reviews but cannot express how incredibly disappointed there is no conclusion by the end of this book. I made the mistake of preordering this book but wish I could take it back after knowing the author lied to all of us by saying this was a trilogy. I will never buy her books again.<br /><br />It is one thing if there was enough story to the book but there is now obvious stretching going on just to make more money at the detriment of storytelling.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game and if you like temple run,then you will like this game. There are tons of challenges you can do. Every time the subway surfers move to a new place, there are different characters and boards to get. So overall, I think you should get this game.

B005COO1X6|2.0|Being a Stephen  King fan for many, many years....since he first came on scene with \\"Salem's Lot\\".....I was looking forward to reading this book.  Imagine my surprise when the book ended after the 6th chapter!!  And I paid $2.99 for only six chapters....BUMMER!  The premise is good and I would like to ask Mr. King when he plans to finish writing<br />the book???  This appears to be an outline.  My advice?  Skip it!

Well...here's an update, I found the blu ray/dvd combo pack at Walmart for only $19.96!  Now that is a deal!
B008JFUMHE|4.0|It's inevitable that you go into every movie expecting something. For \\"Now You See Me\\", I expected to see a movie about magicians, obviously, but to have a bunch of dazzling tricks that weren't humanly possibly and they would go unexplained; as if they were possessed by some other-worldly entity. There is that scene in the trailer where the four-horsemen (their magician team stage name) leap from a building and magically turn into hundreds and thousands of floating dollars. So, I figured that would be the case for the movie because that was a brilliant piece of editor magic at work in that particular shot.  I was wrong.<br /><br />\\"Now You See Me\\" starts off introducing us to four different magicians, two are well known, one is on her way up and one uses his skills as a common street thief. Together, they are brought to a locked room in a dingy hotel by a mysterious benefactor and coaxed to become a team in order to achieve a certain goal. That goal is a mystery to us as is most of the movie. The movie then cuts to just a year later and the four magicians have become the Four-horsemen, a daring magician team that quickly becomes the talk of the world after just their first show.<br /><br />Now I'm not gonna go into any more details about the movie because that is all the fun. Just like any magic trick, you don't want to know how it was done, you want to see it for yourself and figure it out for yourself. That is what I truly liked about \\"Now You See Me\\". The movie itself is a magic trick. It doesn't rely on unexplained special effects. In fact, they explain nearly every single trick in the movie and how it was done. That adds to the quality of the movie because even though they are telling you how tricks are done, you are only enlightened for a few moments before the next trick occurs and you try to figure out that one as well.<br /><br />\\"Now You See Me\\" is gonna be a sneak hit in my opinion. As time goes by, this movie will have life. In fact, as word of mouth gets out, this movie will have a steady pace of success before it gets swallowed up by the Summer movie tidal wave. Don't be mistaken though, if you like movies that are intelligent and challenging, \\"Now You See Me\\" is your kind of movie. With a great cast of Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Morgan Freeman, Isla Fisher, Woody Harrelson and Michael Caine, this movie is gifted with great actors, working from an intelligent script that will keep you guessing. Despite all that, it will most likely slip through the cracks of all the mindless Summer movies that are on the way, so go see it before it disappears.s out, this movie will have a steady pace of success before it gets swallowed up by the Summer movie tidal wave.

B006AZZPCM|4.0|Having used a number of YouTube downloaders on my Kindle Fire HD, this one works best. It's stable and delivers as promised. Advertisements are annoying &amp; the same applies here but that's the norm for &quot;free&quot; stuff. The advertisements here are no better or worse but are a little different. I will occasionally get a full screen ad for some movie from some provider. I can live with that given the function and features of this app. I like it.

B000I3UMLQ|1.0|This isn't just the worst movie in the franchise history.  This might just rank up there with the worst movies ever.  Where to begin?<br />1.) Kirk rockclimbing.  Seriously?<br />2.) Chekhov and Sulu getting lost in the woods.  Seriously?  They can find their way across galaxies, but they can't handle the woods?<br />3.) Kirk, Bones, Spock sitting around a campfire singing \\"row row row your boat\\" in a round.  Wow.<br />4.) You're telling me Star Fleet is going to send out a ship that the doors won't even open and the transporters don't work?  Double wow.<br />5.) Think Star Trek meets Mad Max, meets bar from Star Wars.  I kid not.<br />6.) The unscariest Clingon in the history of clingons.  Actually laughable.<br />7.) Uhura doing a hoochie-mama dance.  Actually not laughable.<br />8.) What is the point of the movie?<br />9.) A blind monkey with a cleft pallet could come up with a better script and dialogue.  Really bad.<br />10.) Special Effects?  Not all that special.  We're talking bad.  Really bad.<br />11.) The score.  Also bad.<br />12.) Scottie and uhura makin' the eyes at each other?<br />13) Chekov and Sulu getting a little too much screen time together, if ya know what I mean.<br />14) Everything else.<br /><br />I mean its bad.  Its laughably bad.  To go from 4 which was pretty good to 6 which may be my favorite and smack dab in between is this pile of feces hidden in a brown bag, lit on fire, and thrown on the doorstep of my entertainment center.  It will make you cringe it stinks that bad.  Really.
0399534601|5.0|This book is a must for those adults who have lost their way in the world and need to rediscover their childhood adventures and sense of wonderment...Love this book and so will you!
0425263991|5.0|Brought to you by OBS reviewer Heidi<br /><br />*Beware of Spoilers*<br /><br />Kaleb Krychek is one of the most feared men in all of the Psynet.  He's a dual cardinal toting powers unmatched by anyone along with his abilities to cloak himself on the net, he can make moves without anybody being the wiser.  But above all he is ruthless, and will do whatever it takes to get the outcome he wants, and he always wins.<br /><br />But Kaleb wasn't always the strong individual he is now.  He was once pretty vulnerable, left in the hands of a madman at the age of three.  He endured unthinkable tortures during his `training' as Santano Enrique tried to mold him into his image, to continue on his own sick legacy.  But there was a glimmer of light that kept Kaleb sane, the one thing that helped him hold on to his own humanity.  Her name was Sahara Kyriakus and she was the one person that truly saw him when she looked at him.  And, Kaleb's world changed forever when Enrique got his hands on her.  She was kidnapped when she was sixteen years old and Kaleb has been searching for her ever-since, seven long years.  But now he has finally found her once again.  She is his and he won't let anybody separate them again.<br /><br />I was unsure if I'd like this book.  I'm a HUGE Changeling fan, but the Psy tend to be a bit too cold and distant for my liking.  The previous Psy relationships in this series have been kind of dull for me, so I was worried this would be another one of those books that I'd have to force myself to finish.  I could not have been more wrong.  I ended up loving it and feel that Heart of Obsidian is arguably the best installment of the series to date.<br /><br />They synopsis of this book really doesn't tell you much, it doesn't even tell you who it's about.  I assumed that the `dangerous, volatile rebel' was probably the Ghost, but most of the other fans I saw were guessing it was Kaleb.  So I was surprised and delighted to discover that it was about a little of both!<br /><br />Heart of Obsidian is a love story about two young sweethearts that were torn away from one another during tragic events beyond their control.  Heart of Obsidian is a story about their long-awaited reunion and the obstacles they must face to find their way back in each other's arms.  If you liked Clay and Tally's relationship, you will LOVE Heart of Obsidian, as Kaleb and Sahara blow them clean out of the water, and this from someone who adores Clay and Tally!<br /><br />Kaleb was always a character that I respected.  I didn't know what to think about him, but I knew he was powerful and I always enjoyed his take charge attitude.  But this book shows us a completely different side of him, and I LOVED it!  It was great to see that Kaleb does care about something other than himself. And, even better that underneath that thick layer of black ice, he truly does have a heart; it's warm, loving, and beats for one person and one person only; Sahara.  I loved seeing this sweeter side to him, it gives him so much more depth.  All the little mementos he held on to from his childhood days with Sahara was sweet, especially as we were slowly introduced to their significance.  And, this book made me love this man, the man he's been hiding deep within himself, so much.  In addition, I really enjoyed how protective Kaleb was of the one girl that means the world to him.<br /><br />I also enjoyed Sahara.  She's tough, a fighter, a survivor, and she will do anything to bring Kaleb into the light and keep him there with her.  But she's also realistic and knows that he will always be him and that it's her job to challenge him when he's going too far.<br /><br />\\"You'll have to be my conscience.\\" He knew his flaws, and he knew the parts of him that were irrevocably broken. \\"Mine isn't going to grow back.\\"<br /><br />I truly loved this couple and cannot get enough of them!  I'm hoping, begging, and pleading we get more of them in the future!<br /><br />But this book gave usmore than just an amazing romance.  It gave us a huge change for the Psy race as a whole and I'm curious and anxious to see how it will effect the dynamic in the future, especially when it comes to dealing with the other races.  This book was monumental in the story arc of the series.  I know several people that have mentioned they were going to skip this installment because it was about a Psy relationship.  I implore you not to!  Skipping this book is not only shortchanging yourself, but the series as a whole!  I finished the book a few hours ago and I'm still sitting here with a good book hangover.  You know, in the series, they often mention good sex that leaves the participants so completely sated that their bones turn to jelly and they can hardly move?  That is exactly how I feel after reading this book; I'm so much more satisfied than I ever expected to be, and I feel I might need a cigarette afterwards, and I don't even smoke!<br /><br />\\"So we literally made the earth move? A slight pause, before Kaleb said, I suggest we don't engage in sex in populated areas.\\"<br /><br />This book was just completely amazing and it leaves me wondering how Singh will ever be able to top it.  But she seems to always find a way, so I will sit back and impatiently wait for the next installment to be released and enjoy the ride once it arrives!<br /><br />This review and more at openbooksociety dot com
B007J4T2G8|2.0|when everyone said you had to get the trilogy i was like okay.  i expected something more twisted and erotica..fell flat.  i could have picked up any other romance novel and got the same crap.  this is not what to expect.  borrow please from paperback..the trilogy is not worth getting.  you want erotica? pick up penthouse letters..
030789701X|5.0|Gives tons of information on the game and is probably one of the best game guides to date this is a must buy.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|what can i say..what is the fuss about having sex in every other chapter and it wasn't even that erotic!!!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It forced me to take an honest look at my own life and how I use the gift of time.  I think this book should be read by every parent.  As a father of two tween daughters, I often find myself so focused on their futures, I fail to cherish the moment.  This book came along at a perfect time in my life.  Thanks Mitch!
B007IXWL2C|2.0|ok i read this because i was like it better get more exciting than the first.  huge disappointment.  Don't know why everyone made a fuss.  every other chapter was doing but sex and it got very boring.  Come on!! where is the spice!!!
B00C9U9YOW|4.0|It's been six years since QOTSA last released a studio album the much more experimental sounding \\"Era Vulgaris\\", in the time since the band have kept themselves busy by re-mastering and reissuing their first two studio albums, as well as touring for both, especially great was the intimate tour for their self-titled debut which they would play in its entirety as well as that the various members kept themselves busy with side projects, front man Josh Homme formed Them Crooked Vultures along with Dave Grohl and John Paul Jones while Keyboardist/guitarist Dean Fertitia hooked up with Jack White in The Dead Weather. However the band has been promising a new album since late 2010 and it's only now that Josh Homme admits that the band was struggling for ideas and for what direction to go in. Homme freely admits phoning Trent Reznor and asking for a bit of guidance to get everything kick started, Reznor was soon followed by a whole cast of musicians and what we are left with is a ten track album that is a worthy addition to the QOTSA catalogue.<br /><br />The first thing to say is that the vast array of musicians who have signed up for this don't take away from this being a QOTSA record in fact the return of Dave Grohl on drums for the six of the tracks only adds an extra dynamic to the sound. The album opens up with \\"Keep your Eyes Peeled\\" which features a big bluesy riff and some big industrial sounding beats, it's a song that twists and weaves between heavy and melodic and features the Scissor Sisters Jake Shears on background vocals, Shears also appears on the funky \\"Smooth Sailing\\" which has big falsetto delivery from Homme. One of the stand out tracks is the groove laden \\"If I Had A Tail\\" with its imaginative chorus and background vocals from long-time collaborator Mark Lanegan whose heavy haunting back ground vocal is unmistakable and has an outro featuring Alex Turner and Joshs wife Brody Dalle. Interestingly former bassist/vocalist Nick Oliveri also appears on thetrack as well as on \\"Fairweather Friends\\".<br /><br />This is probably the most complete line up of QOTSA since 2002 with touring members Dean Fertita and Michael Shuman now making their first studio appearance along with long time member Troy Van Leeuwen, it's also safe to say that Homme isn't scared to give away some of the best guitar riffs and solos to Van Leeuwen and Fertita. Fertitia even gets to take center stage for the lead riff on the pounding \\"My God Is The Sun\\". Trent Reznor makes his presence felt on two tracks the first being the brilliant \\"Kalopsia\\" which alternates between being dreamy and melodic and then being heavy with a crunching riff backed by the now departed Joey Castillo on drums, Reznors vocal kicks in at the 1.12 mark and changes the direction of the song. Reznor appears again on \\"Fairweather Friends\\" a song that is driven by the drumming of Grohl. The album closes out with the two longest tracks in \\"I appear Missing\\" which is followed by the splendid title track \\"...Like Clockwork\\" which has Homme stretching his vocal range and abilities and features a certain Elton John on piano.<br /><br />It might have taking six long years for a follow up to \\"Era Vulgaris\\" but with \\"...Like Clockwork\\" QOTSA have delivered their most well rounded album since 2002's \\"Songs For The Deaf\\" and you just know that these songs will take on a life of their own once they hit the road.

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Once again the authors are looking for more cash!!!!!!!! This was supposed to be the last book in the trilogy and yet here we go again. I loved the first 2 books but this book ended ???? Not sure where these characters are going... This book leaves a lot to be desired... I guess when I buy a book I want an entire book not just pieces.
B0074MZSWW|4.0|Good new music, rough and raw recording, no BS, straight forward, good vocals. Hope to hear more from them, wish them all the best.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|It feels like a complete betrayal to waits months for the FINAL book of a TRILOGY only to find out at the last minute that not only is it a 5 part book but that Entwined in you is just a money making filler. Nothing happened except unneeded drama and setting up books 4 and 5, which wouldn't have been necessary if the author hadn't decided to make more money by dragging it out to more books.<br /><br />Definitely wouldn't recommend this book, and the sad thing is I LOVED their story and the two previous books.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|\\"Sometimes, you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal, and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book.\\" -John Green, \\"The Fault in Our Stars\\"<br />  For the past ten years John Green, author of Printz Award Winner Looking for Alaska, among many others, had attempted to write a story regarding cancer after serving five months at a children's hospital as a chaplain after college. His experiences with unnecessary death have helped him pen one of the best, if not the best, examples of modern YA literature.<br />  Sixteen year old Hazel Grace Lancaster has been diagnosed with lung cancer. Despite the tumor-shrinking miracle that has bought her some years, her time is running out. Hazel lives her life reading the same book, \\"An Imperial Affliction\\" by Peter van Houten, over and over again and feels that the author \\"gets\\" her and how she, a teen with cancer, feels. Hazel wants nothing more than to know what happens after the end of the book, where the novel ends mid-sentence, symbolizing the unpredictable nature of death. Hazel's mother takes her unusual behavior as a sign of depression and signs her up for a Cancer Kid Support Group at the local church, featuring a rotating cast of the terminally ill. It is here that she makes a friend of Isaac, a lover of video games with cancer in the remaining eye that fate has spared him. She also falls for charismatic, one-legged Augustus Waters, who, when he offers to give up his cancer Wish (think Make-a- Wish foundation) to see Peter van Houten, changes her life in way she would never have imagined.<br />  Before reading the novel, the idea turned me off somewhat. As Hazel herself states, \\"Cancer books suck\\". This is not a book about cancer. This is not a book about death - these elements serve primarily the drive the plot along, but it is the ingenious and intelligent characters and the relationships between them, primarilybetween Hazel and Gus, that make this book. TFiOS, like all of John Green's novels, is not dumbed down for teenagers. While Hazel and Augustus are most definitely adolescents, their dialogue gives away their deeper maturity. Despite their terminal illnesses, these incredibly likable characters do not behave in a way that reminds one of the fact.<br />  \\"The Fault in Our Stars\\" is beautiful, funny, undeniably clever, and emotionally moving. To quote one of John Green's YouTube videos, it truly does make the reader \\"feel all the things.\\" TFiOS can likely drive a reader to laugh while crying, feel anger in the midst of pity, and feel joy in the presence of death. It is a miracle it could even be captured in words at all, thus making it nearly impossible to describe. If this book does not give a reader chills, they may very well not possess a soul.
B0053O89WY|5.0|The title says it all, the show is great and this should be in every fan's personal library.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|First, for those who aren't happy with what it's about, this is just a game! It's no different than playing a first/third shooter game where your goal is to kill your opponents. In this game, however, you're a \\"plague\\" and your goal is to wipe out humanity. If that bothers you, that's okay, but don't waste your money on this game. If you can ignore it (or don't mind games that are more morbid), then I definitely recommend this game to you! I will say, this game does mention real life diseases/viruses and how you compare to them, so if that does really bother you, I would dodge this game!<br /><br />This game can be very addicting! You start out as a bacteria then go on using DNA points to get different abilities, symptoms, and transmission. The key is to try to make it so that you aren't noticed right away yet contagious. Starting up in countries that have a lot of traffic coming in and out helps as well! I do like some of the little, side news reports (like the planes removing seats for passengers). You also can play as seven different things, from bacteria to bio-weapon. There are three levels of play (casual, normal, and brutal). Yes, you can pay to unlock the extras, but you do get them for playing the game in normal or brutal levels. So, there is no actual need to pay for anything unless you are impatient or want the game to be easier.<br /><br />Overall, a dollar well spent for as much time as I give this game! Again, I highly recommend this game to those who don't mind what it's about and love strategy games!
B003L77G6A|5.0|Great comedy as the characters continue to develop.  The price was the best around and delivery is the next best thing to instant.<br /><br />Order now and be laughing in two days.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|Truly entertaining and innovative. The characters are relatable in such a way that are no &#34;good&#34; or &#34;bad&#34; guys, which makes this show fun at times and dramatic at other times without being silly. Looking forward to season 2.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I'll never get enough of Gideon and Evas story. Their love is beautifully screwed up, but Gideon showed his devotion to Eva in this book, so it was more than lust and sex and domination by a sexy alpha male. I'm so happy Entwined is finally out, on to it now!! Thank you Sylvia for giving us this world to get lost in!
B00915G6YE|4.0|If you like Dexter you should enjoy this season. It's not as good as Season 1 or 4 but I think it was as least as good as Season 3 or Season 5.<br /><br />There was some pretty decent character development for Dex and Deb this season. More for Dexter than Deb but you can start to get an idea of where things may go in the final season.
B005DF2QMC|3.0|It was an awesome idea for recovering old tapes but the volume level sucks.  You lose the quality and sound level.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|DUDE!!! WTF else can I say? That underlying QOTSA sound is there (like it always is), but they touch on a melancholy sadness combined with a hip shaking groove. This album is their best since Songs for the Deaf. I have always been partial to the Self-Titled album as my favorite but Like Clockwork is giving it a run for it's money. Thank God for QOTSA as they are one of a few real rock bands left. Buy this... you won't be disappointed.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|Love the series! Love Gideon and Eva! LOVE that there is going to be more! Way to go Sylvia Day, this part of their story was gorgeous and romantic. It was lovely to feel the characters trust and love after the previous novel. So excited their story continues, can't wait!
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|What else can I say but AMAZING!  I never thought the story would end like this.  After reading Something Borrowed I had to read this one.  Throughout the book I cried, laughed and was mad.  If you have not read Something Borrowed read it first or it won't make a whole lot of sense.  Emily Giffin is an amazing author and I am anxious for a new book to be published!

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|There was so much useless content it was a joke. The quality of this series is declining while the price is not! I could justify the cliff hanger and the addition of more books IF it didn't seem dragged out......which it does! This is where I get off the Crossfire train.

B006ZKEX7U|3.0|Dunno what it is, but I have yet to hear a Chinese classical guitarist that seemed to understand either the instrument or Western music in general.  Ms. Yang is no exception.  She sounds like every other Chinese guitarist: the stunning technique of a middle-aged virtuoso and the musical understanding of a precocious trained simian.  As you can see by the other reviews, the average listener also apparently has the musical understanding of a precocious trained simian.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I was more than patient when the release date for the last book in an amazing trilogy was rescheduled twice. Now after waiting 9 months for the release I find out that it is no longer a trilogy. I'm furious and I feel lied to. I'm done with this series.
B000P6R5D4|5.0|This is an excellent true to life story about Beatrix Potter. This film was very well acted and I would highly recommend.
B000FCK65W|4.0|I was required to read this in high school 33 years ago...I enjoyed it then and wanted to read it again and see if it still was something I would enjoy, and mostly it was
B0083Z614S|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! It is great for kids AND adults! Frances Hodgson Burnett is a fantastic author. I'm so glad I read it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  Was certainly kept on the edge waiting for what was gonna happen when I turned the page!!  I am so excited for the next one!
B00CBR9S44|3.0|Very little theatrical acting. Let's face it: Kung Fu fans will love it. Disc two, the special edition, does not have English subtitles; I hope your Chinese, et al, is fluent.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I like the game but hard to add people on kindle and it freezes you out so you lose tokens.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Funny how you can feel such a strong connection to someone just by listening to the words they speak.  James, you did an incredible job on this book.  Thank you for being a real human being and giving us all that little bit of perspective we need when life has us down.  Keep living, keep writing and keep choosing yourself..
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I can´t say I did not like it but I guess after The Kite Runner and the following novel I was expecting more from him. However I also liked this story.
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|The authors just make up situation and events one after an other. It will all work out because the authors will invent just one more unbelievable, convenient circumstance and we go on to the next crisis. unbelievable.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Always dreamt of owning a horse, and had took several horse lessons but cannot afford to own one. This games helps me be happy for now (:
B000FC2OHA|5.0|Lots of good principles here and a very easy read. I would recommend it to any business person but also good for general knowledge.
B00BEXB18M|1.0|I tried to like it, I really did. BUT there is no other way to put it, this album is super cheesy and flat out stinks. On \\"Youthanasia\\" Megadeth showed they didn't need to be a full<br />on thrash metal band to create interesting and worthwhile songs. So the lack of \\"thrash\\" and \\"metal\\" and that this is more of a hard rock album isn't the issue. It's that the songs regardless of style or genre objectively SUCK. They are lazy turds that are poorly written and arranged. It sounds like Mustaine crapped these songs out in 5 minutes. Any of the few ideas on display here that do have potential, they unfortunately fail to turn them into compelling whole songs. The biggest pitfall of the album are the outright laughable, cringe worthy and embarrassing lyrics on every song. They are grating and kill any of the decent moments in the underlying music:<br /><br />\\"Burn baby burn cause it's feels so good...fire, burning desire, my desire to burn...burns hotter than hell\\"<br /><br />Are you kidding me?<br /><br />Some of the solos are ok but this is Megadeth for crying out loud, they should be awesome.<br /><br />Overall, Super Collider is a strong contender for being the worst Megadeth album ever. Avoid this one. At least Megadeth still put on a good live show.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What a rarity! The writing is really great. I've never read anything as unique and suspenseful as this series. Very out of the box thinking on the fall of society and the deceptive power of the government we literally entrust our lives to. You will be left guessing at every turn and nothing as it seems even when you think it does.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Knowing nothing of the book or Patrick Rothfuss, I read this on the recommendation of a friend and have not been disappointed! Great characters and absorbing narrative, with just enough fantasy elements to keep things interesting.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Have you ever wondered what goes on inside a mans head as he is going through the stages of falling in love? well in the case of Drew, it turns out it's a sarcastic, witty and hilarious journey. What a refreshing take on the \\"playboy meets good girl, can't have her, finally wins her, ultimately screws up, boy sets out to win the girl back at all costs\\" tale. This book is a must read for all contemporary romance fans.  I can't wait for more from this author. Was this really her debut novel? Amazing.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like this app and would recommend it for anyone who love horses :). The graphics are cool and pretty life like.  Great game!
B00007KQA3|5.0|This movie's look is spot on with what I'd envisioned in my head the first time I'd read the book.The inquisition/torture scene with Smith is chilling and profound.Great performances throughout.I'd have to say the version without the Eurythmics soundtrack is the better of the two.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I personally liked Entwined With You and can't understand all the low ratings.  It continued Eva and Gideon's story right where book 2 ended.  The characters are both still flawed but struggling to make themselves better as individuals and as a couple.  You get nosy, vindictive reporters, his creepy mother and brother, her crazy over protective mother, hot sex and a little more of the BDSM element.<br /><br />Everyone seems pissed because the book wasn't tied up neat and tidy with a clear cut HEA (I was too at first, but if there weren't going to be any more books then we'd all be moaning about no more Gideon.  Give Sylvia Day the benefit of the doubt and calm down.  I rated it at a 4 simply because this book was good and kept me turning the pages, but it was lacking something that I can't quite put my finger on.
B00CTSDDVO|1.0|Is it really that difficult to come up with an original idea? Seems they decided to just pick all the cool things from past movies and throw them in to a pot,then stir it up and feed it to the masses.I'm a lifelong fan.Liked the last film,story holes and all,but this one .........ergh.That's all I can say.
1439177791|5.0|This is an amazing story of courage, strength and love. To overcome something of this magnitude will give anyone the strength they need to overcome their fears. You will cry as you read this because it is heartbreaking at times. I would definately recommend reading this story.
B00BD6KPFU|5.0|I really loved this season and the show continues to amaze me. From the characters to the funny antics, suits its a amazing show.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I decided to check this one out because I was getting bored with the games I usually download and this game has become my current favorite.  Beautiful colors and nice graphics. If you liked the movie you'll really enjoy this game.
B00BR0SGN0|5.0|It seems Deep Purple is back and in full form again. This is one the best Deep Purple albums released in decades and the best of the albums with Steve Morse in the band. them. Heavy Keyboards, Blistering guitar work, Thundering bass and drums and Ian Gillian at the helm on vocals. The chemistry of the current lineup really shines on Now What. Steve Morse is in top form and his guitar work is amazing. Don Airey has really stepped up the plate too on this release. Thunderous keyboards dominate the album just like you  would expect from a Deep Purple album. This latest release was produced by legendary Bob Ezrin ( Pink Floyd, Kiss, Alice Cooper and many others) and it really shows in the final production on this one. If you love Deep Purple and want to hear something new I would highly suggest you add copy of Now What to your collection! I think once you hear it you will be glad you did.
0738737909|5.0|Tarot Illuminati deserves 5 Stars for it's overall pleasing delight to the eye! Pleasing as in the bright colors and being rich in symbolism on every single card. A great plus for me it has no border to distract from the card. The companion book is just as beautiful as the deck, well written and in color! Even the box is sturdy and a delight to look at. This deck will be good for a beginner as well as the seasoned pro. Tarot Illuminati reads easily in the Rider-Waite tradition. Wonderful deck!  Kudos to Erik C. Dunne and Kim Huggens!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really enjoyed all three books. However, they both have so much insecurities. I can understand Grey's but Ana? Well written lots of education. New words. Keep dictionary close by.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|This might be the best thing Nalini Singh has ever written, and that's saying a lot because I love her books, all of them, unreservedly.  But this one is something special.<br /><br />For fans of the series, this book is going to answer a lot of questions and bring together a lot of disparate plot threads that have been slowly building over the course of the 11 preceding books--the identity of the Ghost, the escalating situation with Pure Psy, the relationship between the races, and the future of Silence within the PsyNet.  With so much going on, this book could have been a hot mess.  Instead, Singh pulls it all together with a skill that is nothing less than masterful.<br /><br />There is a lot of plot happening in this novel, more than is typical for the romance genre, but it never overwhelms the story of the developing relationship between the two main characters.  Instead the romance weaves so naturally into the action that it is genuinely impossible to imagine the story without that relationship at its center.  And the love story is amazing.<br /><br />Both the hero and the heroine have been through some dark, majorly traumatic things and have some incredible abilities, and as the story unfolds more and more secrets are revealed.  The pacing is great--despite knowing how much was still to be revealed, I never wanted to rush through reading to \\"find out what happens\\" because I was so wholly entranced with what was happening at the moment.  I savored literally every word.<br /><br />But the thing I loved most about this novel was how beautiful the relationship was between the two main characters.  Despite all their baggage, the two manage to connect is a way that is sweet and strangely innocent.  The way they relate to each other is at times unbearably adorable.  And yeah--the love scenes are crazy hot.<br /><br />Note for new readers: Because this book is the 12th of an increasingly plot-heavy series, this might not be the best introduction to Nalini Singh's work, only because there's a lot of background that you won't know.  Most of the previous novels in the series are significantly more able to stand alone, but the best place to start is the first book in the series, Slave to Sensation.

B000002O4S|5.0|I purchased it for my 9 year old son who is obsessed with the movie and the music. He loves playing air guitar to Johnny B. Goode!
B009Z5BPZK|5.0|A must have for anybody that enjoys this show.  As usual, Amazon had it to me quick so I didn't have to wait to watch!
0446577391|5.0|I am a late comer to David Baldacci's work, so I'm catching up.  This is the third of the Camel Club series and it did not fail to satisfy.  I enjoyed the book very much. It is riveting, as I have found all of Baldacci's works to be, and leaves you wanting more.  Spoiler alert: I was sorely disappointed that one of the main characters in this series was killed off. It was a character that I was particularly fond of and will miss very much.  As a result of the loss of this character I have been slow to obtain a copy of the book that followed in the series but I do plan to remedy that soon.

B007IXWKUK|4.0|Very well written. Kept your mind thinking. A very good story line. Never a dull moment. Not a children's book.

B008GXHOFW|3.0|This game IS pretty good, but it gets boring after a while. Also sometimes it's kinda glitchy, but not that bad. I would recommend it if you like super hero games like the Captain America game.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I recommend trying this application out with your children. Creativity and fun is the heart of the game and if you are familiar with mega blocks and legos, then this is the next step. My child had very little knowledge of complex interfaces and general knowledge of the game before I let her play; in no time she picked up the basics and began creating. I'm still impressed!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Any reader would enjoy this book, but as a parent it also made me stop and think.  I really enjoyed the way the author developed the story... going from courtroom to flashback and back.  I have been searching for a book that would lock me in and this one did it.  I am highly recommending this to all my friends!
B003K025V4|5.0|I love this cd. This c-d is the best! I still listen to it in my vehicle on my way to work. great quality.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved it but it was so unexpected this book was great. it's  sad scary happy it's the best book ever
0756655307|2.0|I grew up reading Marvel Comics and I'm a big fan, but my favorite comic was Conan the Barbarian, then King Conan, and then the Savage Sword of Conan.  I'm still shaking from my disgust that Conan was not included in this encyclopedia.  I felt like giving it only one star, but that wouldn't be fair to what it does contain.  As it is, I'm horribly disappointed.
B004L9MFM2|5.0|A Clash of Kings certainly lived up to the hype. This book was wonderfully written. I enjoyed the old and new characters, and I look forward to following their story in the next book.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Have read all five of these books and had waited a long time for the fifth book. It was well worth the wait!! Since this one didn't tie up all the storylines I hope we don't have to wait too long for the next one

1781162646|4.0|Diehard Stephen King fans know the man has a penchant for writing long, doorstop length novels. While considered by many to be one of the most prolific writers ever, others say his novels come off as long winded, or in need of some fluff editing. Joyland, however, is a different sort of book altogether. At a mere 283 pages, it's one of King's shortest novels written to date. The novel presents itself as a fantastic, cohesive piece of hard boiled crime. King said in an interview recently that the reason he picked publisher Hard Case Crime for this particular book is because they are known for publishing the sort of books he remembered reading as a child. He remarked that he would browse the drugstore selection, spinning book racks, while his mother shopped for groceries, picking out books with scantily clad women and teaser lines on the front. The real reason that King was able to make Joyland such an enjoyable read is not only because he's a fantastic writer, but because the book is an amalgamation of all the genres he loves to write about: crime, horror, mystery, and the supernatural.<br /><br />Joyland is simply a different sort of Stephen King novel. Although it is a novel about a crime, it contains more important, overarching themes deep within the plot. Contained within Devin's personal experiences is a bildungsroman story about a young college man who is trying to find his footing in life. We find Devin at the beginning of the novel struggling not only with his first relationship, but with his future troubles of unfair death and the unpleasantness of life. The actual mysterious part of the story takes a bit to get going, but King does a fantastic job with building this tiny, exciting world located on the edge of a boardwalk. The constant foreshadowing to future events and the green Victorian make the reader more and more curious about what the future holds for Devin Jones. Joyland might just be another notch on Mr. King's belt, but it just goes to show that hedoesn't need to write a 1000 page tome to tell an outright fantastic story.<br /><br />Read the full review here: http://mediasnobs.com/book-review/joyland/
B0074VA2T2|5.0|My kids love this game! Glad I found it free on one of the days I was browsing around Amazon.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyable.  Smart, funny, and just plain cool. Well written and acted, even though the premise is one that could strain believability.  Harvey and Mike make a &#34;dynamic duo&#34;, and the chemistry between the stars Gabriel Macht & Patrick J. Adams drives the show (and we can't forget Rick Hoffman as Louis- the associate you'll love to hate).  Try it, you'll like it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is a brain teaser sometimes so it's vary fun Even my dad will play it I love this game
B003QTUQGU|5.0|With a Tim Burton twist and Johnny Depp's dark art filled humor brought to life a great adventure for the not so little anymore Alice as an insane hatter this movie ended with the hatter doing a thudawakin which i though was shocking as his head span around like a robot just to be mimicked by Alice in the real world to show her family she wants to take her own path in life, without the head spinning because if that happened i would not watch it again lol.
B000HF0ISC|5.0|A good movie that kept my attention the entire time.  Sad, but hopefully not true, about a place where troubled boys go instead of jail because they are young and teenagers.  They were so helpless but carried the burden with them their entire lives.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is good for all ages. I like to play it all the time and I would definitely recommend this.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I loved this book!!  Everything about it.  I loved Drew's cockiness and the way that Kate dealt with him.  I loved getting inside his head and the hilarious things found in it.  I loved his family and the way he related to his niece.  This book was so funny, witty, steamy and I wish I could unread it and read it again for the first time.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I usually stick to the same authors but took a chance and glad I did.  Felt connected to the characters and love the way the chapters were presented.  Can't wait to read more of her books.
B004I11VZ0|5.0|This is one movie that kept me up, I sat up to at least 03:30am and never once felt sleepy this is a must see movie. Where did this movie come from, please let me add if your don't have a l.e.d screen tv your missing not only a excellent movie but also the quality.I wanted to know if you can hear these movies in english also; I've seen a copy which was in english then a family member tried to watch this movie on netflex but it was not in english. I want to buy the movie but I don't want to buy the wrong one.[[ASIN:B003INBOEM Ip Man (Two-Disc Collector's Edition) [Blu-ray]]]
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best game ever it is the rummest too but it or purchase it no matter what
B00A81NFAS|1.0|I think this is one of the worst and boring movies I have watched during this year. Why so many awards? I just don't understand.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|Only giving it 3 stars because It has started freezing and won't open.. I love this game... hope they fix the problem soon.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I really enjoy this version of Virtual City. There are many new things to do and build. I do wish it was not aimed so obviously at getting players to spend real money to get further into the game. You can play with the money generated within the game without actual cash online, but it is much slower and takes days to earn city money within the game. I decided that I would invest $20 in this game and bought &quot;invest money&quot; online. still having fun!
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is so good .The online quality of the game is great an the story is amazing.<br /><br />I'm 13
B003IEJZUG|4.0|Hard to get into the beginning of story, but once you get to the meat of the story  it was hard to quit reading.
1451696191|5.0|This came to me in a day and was in perfect condition. That night I got it signed by Stephen Chbosky himself! A great read for everyone.
B00B2G2RG6|4.0|I love this series.  The only thing I would change would be that the bad guys win too much.  Not is favor of evil winning all the time.<br />Other than that the characters are good and the story line is awesome.
B008220BP2|5.0|This movie was so unusual that it was worth every second of film that it took to produce it! There have been thousands of love stories out there in all the years of movie making history, but none that actually make you root for the zombie to get the girl! Funny, sweet, yet a bit scary at times, Nicholas Hoult and Teresa Palmer play their roles to perfection. By the end of the movie, you feel happy and content, yet deep inside, you find yourself wishing that the story would continue on. Maybe wondering if \\"R\\" becomes truly human again? Or do he and Julie go on with their lives together and produce half zombie babies? Haha! I say that a Warm Bodies sequel with Nicholas Hoult and Teresa Palmer should be considered for all those people out there like me who need their love story to further blossom into a forever land of zombie \\"happily ever after\\"...
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Great story.  Keeps us on the edge of our seat wondering just who the bad guys are. Love the characters.  I tell everyone about it.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|App is good, one problem with it is that you really need to spend money if you want to keep up with quests. You also need either Facebook friends or Glive friends.
B0058SNIC6|5.0|I ordered this shoe for a co worker and she loves  it . she uses it everyday at work as she stands for long hours at her job. its very comfortable
B0001I561E|2.0|This product is obviously not official from Disney. Not original case, no original papers.  The movie works, which is all I needed it for, but it is definitely not what you might buy at a store.
B00BX8653O|5.0|Olafur shows great growth (in many ways) as an artist in this album and I LOVE IT! The songs are definitely different than anything he has done in the past, but retain the raw emotion and beautiful production we are so used to hearing from him.<br /><br />Definitely pick this one up if you are a fan of Olafur or looking for some new music that will move you.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This was VERY well-done.  A great &#34;movie&#34; to watch, but also a great educational/homeschooling tool.  Long, but completely worth it!  I would give it a PG-13 rating... has some intense moments and some adult themes that I would be uncomfortable with the younger crowd.
B00C5W3SBE|1.0|Like everyone else I won't pay this ridiculous price for just the 2d Blu-ray of this movie... Disney be warned your greed will backfire on you.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I think the last line in the book really sends the message home: \\"This is about being connected with who you are. This is about seeing how far your potential truly can unravel, simply because you are human.\\"<br /><br />James has a talent to make you think hard and laugh harder with his crafty wit as he shares his experiences.  This book is an enjoyable read for anyone not used to working out the reading part of the brain muscles.  This book is not a panacea for your problems, nor do I think it is intended to be.  It will make you think, and that is the first and most important step to becoming a part of the \\"Choose Yourself era.\\"<br /><br />For context, I used to work on wall street but quit my job one year ago, in large part because James and other thought leaders have helped re-inspire my desire to test the bounds of what we can really do.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This movie resonates with me on a personal level because when I was very young in the late 1960's I went to the \\"wrong\\" water fountain once. Only my Mom and I were in the area at the time. I'm white. My experience was not traumatic, just confusing and bizarre. I've never forgotten it. This movie gives me a glimpse into the mindset of those who were in charge at the time that thought separate facilities were warranted. I don't get it when people talk about the \\"good ole days\\" and how bad things are now as if there was truly ever a golden age in the history of sinful mankind. No. Every generation needs to hit the backspace button sometimes and that's what I see in this movie - people who have the courage and will to tap society on the shoulder and get the cultural hand moving toward the backspace button.
B008TMA1LY|1.0|To complicated for younger kids,crashes a lot and does not save previous games always having to start over good thing it was free
B004XQO90O|4.0|What would you go back and do differently if you could? Source Code is an interesting sci-fi movie with cutting edge technology and suspense along with a story line that touches on the deepest human emotions that make you think about your life and choices. I'm not wild about the ending of the movie though.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A must read.<br />Really keeps your interest and makes you examine motives of rules and history.can't wait for more adventures.
1594484805|2.0|Skip to the back, read the books self-provided cliff notes (thanks for that!). save yourself 35 minutes.  It was just alright, very \\"salesy\\".
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I love the Crossfire series, even better than Fifty Shades, but I am very upset about it stretching out to where you have to buy even more books to finish it, and they are not cheap...I was under the impression that it was a trilogy...It is fine if it is not, but the price needs to be adjusted accordingly...$10.00 an installment is ridiculous! By the time it is over I will have $50.00 in one story...Fifty Shades was bad enough at $30.00...<br /> Don't get me wrong, Day's writing is brilliant and her attention to detail is unmatched...Just come on and adjust the pricing so we can AFFORD to finish the story please!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|My opinion of this game is that it is fun and really entertaining because you have to try to get points to get all the games.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I could read this book over and over again....and I probably will. Awesome read. Sylvia did great on this one and I CANNOT WAIT for Entwined In You.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Great game. I really like the graphics. Also I thought you should be able to get coins faster. Their should also be a setting that lets you turn on and off the sound.
B001UGB1X8|2.0|Thought I'd give this movie a look as it has two of my favorite lead types John Goodman and Tommy Lee Jones. It was however a poorly written screen play that never should have gone to production. This was on top of some poor editing and generally sub-par direction. I'll look a bit closer next time and not just trust the prior work of good actors. The only highlight in the film comes near the close where some good tension is built around the disappearance of a character. This doesn't last though and the rest of the film is a let down.
B004QSQMKE|5.0|I grew up with this movie. Fantactically wimzical, and Darkness is played by Tim Curry. Doesnt get much better than Tim Curry.
0316056898|4.0|I expected a funny book and I got one. I laughed a great deal. Beyond that, Tina has some great advice for women on the career path. Some of the great points were:<br />A. Teach your children they are good enough just the way they are.<br />B. Never be in competition with another woman for a job. You are in competition with everyone. Don't let them bait you into a woman vs women situation.<br />C. No one has the right to call you a c_ _ t.<br />D. Do your own thing and don't care if they don't like it.<br />E. Do they ever ask Trump if it's uncomfortable for him to be the boss?<br /><br />I highly recommend this book especially to the women who juggle it all.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It is so much fun. Helps me pass time and I like it cause you don't have to spend money to enjoy it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Just the right game sized perfectly for my 7 inch tablet.  Thank you,  MW for this fine application.  You earn my five star rating.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This is one of my favorite novels and the movie did it justice. Hugh Jackman was amazing as was Anne Hathaway. The rest of the cast did a lovely job. The two-day French Rebellion reminds me of our own Kent State incident in the 70s. Young, idealistic students set on a revolution. The questions posed are simple: Can a man, like Valjean, be truly rehabilitated in a society that views him as a thief -- and how much of himself does he lose in the process?  Can someone like Fantine rise above the mistakes of youth without judgment? Can a person, like Javier and Cosette, leave behind their troubled childhoods? The movie is a classic for those who aren't put off by the nonstop singing and the many heart-wrenching scenes.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|Very exciting book; hard to put down until the surprising end.  I would have liked a more c inclusive ending, but that did not detract from the story. The courtroom procedure and legal issues were very accurate. Impressive. Connelly does his homework.
0345529057|1.0|The books are great but I received a Feast for Crows with the backing off the book. The other books are in good condition.

B0016BPWNM|4.0|At the 80' this was a classic, the girl how doesn't want to babysit her baby brother ask to the king of the elf to take away, when the baby it's gone she tray to take back and she must solve the labyrinth to find him
B00AVPYT8I|3.0|It is good to have more free choices on your Kindle. But free choices are just that.Do not go in with high expectations.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I enjoy timed puzzle games. It is a great way to kill time. Play at your own risk, it's addictive. Enjoy!
B009NY43NY|5.0|I had to have this book. I had read all the previous one's and watched all the True Bloods. Charlene did not let me down.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I am brand new to this and couldn't put it down. Finally a game that's not tedious, repetitive, and non- stimulating. Kudo's! I need more!
B00881VLCE|2.0|I've tried a lot of puzzle apps and this one is closest to the real thing.  There's a variety of subjects with high quality pictures.  There are a lot of additional puzzles available too, both free and reasonably priced.<br /><br />Update:  downgraded from 4 stars to 2.  Can not install in multiple devices as stated.  Some puzzles cause the app to crash.  Can't uninstall and then reinstall.  Also, their email address isn't valid.<br /><br />Update again:  An update that fixes these issues is available on the Play Store site but does not appear to be available as yet in the Amazon store.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|What more can I say....Loved, Loved, Loved this album.<br />Will buy more of her music. Would highly recommend it to anyone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best app EVER it is fun and introtaning I mean my little sister likes it.(GET THIS GAME)
B003R50FRI|4.0|Enjoyable, especially the pieces on India. Very long book. Maybe could have been a bit shorter. The ending was disappointing.
B000FC1RCI|4.0|Being a book lover and an avid reader, I've obviously heard of Agatha Christie many times. For whatever reason, I was scared to pick up a book from her and read it, but i'm really glad I did. While I didn't love this book, I still really enjoyed it, esp. the concept of the book. I knew once hearing about Gretchen McNeil's retelling of this story, that I needed to read this classic first, to get a full understanding of the re-telling., which I will be reading very shortly to see the similarities and the differences between the two authors, and their different writing styles.<br /><br />Agatha Christie def. has a great writing style, and the characters and the writing were both addictive. I know Agatha is known to be the Queen of Mystery and I guess I wanted more mystery from this story, instead, the ending kinda felt left open and not having a consise and solid answer, but more of a :take what you will\\" from it kind of resolution, and I had expected and wanted more. I felt like I saw all the twists and turns coming which in my opinion a great mystery makes you think something's going to happen, but then takes you in the complete and opposite direction.<br /><br />I definitely want to read more from Agatha Christie, and like I said, I did enjoy the book, and It was a quick read, I just amped it up to be something that fell a bit short for me in the end.
1574214276|5.0|Excellent, easy to follow instructions and enjoyable reading in general.  Directions are very understandable and offers many, many patterns to use for any zentangle art project.
0425263991|5.0|Totally different. Too bad there was no extra content. Didn't want to stop reading.  A Psy couple as strong and close as any other in the series so far.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Game was fun, but a bit too short.  Puzzles are fun and not too challenging.<br />Definitely recommend to those that like puzzles.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I really hate HBO for only making 10-12 episodes per season because this TV Show is just that AWESOME. MUST WATCH!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run two is a great game. The graphics are superb, and you can even change the settings for them. You can earn coins in the game, and buy people and other cool extras. Another thing I love is that you can change a variety of different settings.  Like I said earlier, you can change the settings on the graphics, like zooming in or out. You can also change the tilting sensitivity. The tilting sensitivity is where you tilt your electronic to collect coins in the game, and you get to change how sensitive tour electronic device is to your tilting. Temple Run Two is a great time passer (even though it isn't educational!) and when ever I play it, I just can put it down! I love  Temple run two, and I also love temple run, and the created a of both are awesome!

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I waited months and months to read this.  I feel so disappointed and let down. When did a trilogy become more than three books?  Hope Ms.Day reads all these reviews and understands that many of her fans now see her as a sell out.<br />  Who cares about Corrine? No one, that is who. Did you truly believe that was an ending? Really?  It was such a great book until the Corrine drama started becoming annoying...I don't even know how to explain it.  Never did I think I would be this mad about a book ending. A fictional book ending at that, but here I am.  I am so flustered.<br />  I have so many of  your other books and never did I think.  I would be not able  to keep buying them, but after this... I don't think I even care to buy the next book in this SERIES not<br />Trilogy.  CAN YOU SAY FED-UP. Because I can and am. As should every other person who was duped into this SERIES.<br />  In my opinion, you just lowered yourself to an author that values money more than her fans respect. Enough said.
B00D2K40WY|4.0|This is a good app for when you need something quick. But it limits on make up and dresses. This is good for all ages.
0307346617|5.0|This book was awesome to read and now since the movie is coming out I am a little nervous as to how the quality of the movie will be. Could not put this book down and enjoyed all of the different stories contained within.

B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this app. I have it installed on several devices set to go off at intervals and it always wakes me up. it also has many adjustments that make the alarm clock personal to you and your needs.
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|I got this, set it up, then did a test with my iPhone (had to use an adapter to connect it). Did a short test video with just the onboard mic with my iPhone 5, and then with this mic. I had the thing pinned to the top of my tee shirt. Results: the audio from the onboard mic was MUCH louder, crisper and clearer than the audio from this thing. Sounds great if you hold it directly in front of your mouth, but even just 6-8\\" away and the sound quality suffers considerably. For doing a video where I'm 3-4' from the camera, this is useless.  Maybe if you plan on standing 15' away, then it would be helpful. Even then, the audio quality just isn't that good.

B005R32L66|1.0|This does not work on Samsung S3.  Don't waste your time.  I have two S-3's and it would not work on either one.  The<br />&#34;Echo Test&#34; said it was installed correctly but it still would not work.
B00C7JGDBW|3.0|I'm not sure how different the version I watched was from the theatrical version, so that may bear some differences on content.<br /><br />I recently watched this on a cross-country flight. I was kind of excited because I love Wizard of Oz (and even the creepy [[ASIN:B0000DZ3EN Return to Oz]]); I also was enticed by the cast. I knew there would be some differences due to copyright issues that Disney had to work around but overall it seemed like a fitting prequel.<br /><br />The problem? Not enough character and plot development. Now they did advertise it as being modified from its original format to fit the airplanes' screen size but also edited for content. I wonder how much they edited out because this was like a short story compared to the depth and development in the aforementioned Oz movies.<br /><br />==SPOILER ALERT (and not really much of one but eh, be warned)===<br /><br />You start out in a small town with a magician (Oz) who pulls a Dorothy and winds up in Oz (city). Before the tornado, he meets Michelle William's character and they have some kind of back story but it is so brief that it doesn't truly connect the two of them before he gets transported. Then he gets to Oz, has a mild introduction of a relationship with Mila Kunis' character. Then meets her sister. Then meets Glinda (Michelle Williams). Then fights the \\"evil\\" (Mila Kunis/Rachel Weisz) and then the movie is over. THEN THE MOVIE IS OVER. I just told you the same story in less than an paragraph. If that's any indication to the entertainment you'll get from the movie, then run with it.<br /><br />It gets a 3 star only because it wasn't horrible. It just wasn't good. Or great. Definitely not one I would watch again but at least it seemed family friendly, if there's an upside. No gore, language was appropriate, typical of Disney.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a window into a bygone era. We purchased this because we had already seen seasons 1&2 on DVD and could not wait for season 3. Downton Abbey represents the best, worse and in between of English Society of it's time. This did exist in the US at the same time( for proof I suggest a visit to the Biltmore Mansion in Asheville , North Carolina). The characters,plot and actors are compelling.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book totally caught me off guard. What an amazing love story. Though it's sad it is very well put together. All my questions were answered by the end. Fantastic book!

B008XG1X18|2.0|I love Pintrest, I really do. But,  it slowed down my whole system to where I couldn't hardly do anything. O had to un install it. I love the boards and all of it. If you have a kindle fire, like myself, my app took up a lot of space. Not to mention that I have to usually force close it three to four times to work. I love the computer version the best. Sorry to say I cant keep this app on my kindle.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|An amazing reminder about what life is and listening to your heart! Getting lost in the mundane and fears instead of listening to your heart and being your own legend!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I know that authors cannot always control when books are published but waiting this long for this book set my expectations rather high. I love Gideon and Eva and their story.  This book just did not deliver the way the first two did....I felt like there was lots of sex, not enough substance...I also felt like there was lots of jumping around.  I just could not engage with the story like I could with the first two books.  The ending was disappointing...is she trying to make more money or really please the fans with more books?  Has anyone heard when the next book will be released? Also, spending 10 bucks on this makes me angry especially since I did not love the story.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I enjoy the different combinations of sounds I can combine to help me get to sleep!!!!!  I also like to set the timer to close the app so it does not draw on my battery all night.

B007GCY8FS|5.0|Excellent storyline and very fast moving.  Every detail is believable.  This story fully developed the supporting cast and continues in the tradition of Reacher as a lone wolf.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|I would give &#34;Babel&#34; all the stars. This album is amazing. I bought it about five months ago and am still listening to it, can't stop. Every song is something special and great. You can't go wrong with this Mumford & Sons album.
B00AHGSVKS|4.0|There are many different elements at play in the book, and the author transitions the POV through the book. A great read that opens many questions you will be thinking about a day or two later, but it wasn't a book that I couldn't put down. If you haven't read anything by Clarke, start here. He was a great grasp of language and unfolding a story.

Sometimes i use the adapter for when i am trouble shooting computers with network card issues or even fresh installs where on board network hasn't been installed yet or just doesn't want to work work.  This network adapter has been a godsend and has been used way more then it intend purpose i had for it. I am trying to get my work to order these in so we can have some stock and sell these or even use them for the technicians. Cant wait to get some more iAnker Products.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|I typically do not have high expectations from the .99 cent kindle section, but I read them with the hope that I stumble upon a good story. This is the crown jewel of .99 cent finds! It is a Sci-Fi novel, but it is also a character story, and the protagonist is a great character that drives a well developed story. There are moments of despair when you cannot put the book down, but there are also laugh out loud moments which caused my wife to pull the Kindle away from me to see what I was reading. I don't give a lot of five star reviews, but I have recommended this book to anyone I can. It's a treasure. There is a lot of science in it, but this is a book anyone could pick up and read. Do yourself a favor and buy it.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|I loved this movie and find my self going around and adapting some of the lines to real life.  The characters are lovable and a pleasure to watch. You won't be disappointed if you get this movie.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|Reels you in from the first minute. I have watched the last four seasons in about a month. If I have a free ten minutes, I'm trying to cram as much in as I can. The characters are rich and as real as life, and the decisions and mistakes they make are based on a sense that the viewer can completely understand. Only watch if you are ready to view all five seasons, because you will get hooked.
B00B2DSK06|5.0|This movie is fun and cute while still pulling at your heart strings. For anyone that has ever been singled out, this is a great movie. I shows the everyone is special and can do anything that they can dream. All you have to do is put your heart and soul into it.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|It was not as interesting as the first two books. I had to put it down several times and come back to it few weeks later. But nice predictable ending
B008OOYALE|3.0|I like this game. Like that you can breed dragons to make something that is hard to get. You make friends and have them help you get \\"Gold\\" which you need to buy things that are hard to get or are only available to purchase with \\"Gold\\". Lately they have been making more and more of the dragon available for only a limited time. Which seems to be a push for people to purchase \\"Gold\\" for real money. Also they are making the cost for habitats really expensive. Some of the new ones cost $6 million in Dragon coin. So it takes a long time to save it up or you can purchase coins with real money.  So over all a fun game to play but may not be as free as it appears.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|This is the first William Landry novel I have read. I do read a lot of mystery, crime novels but this one was different in style and deliverance.<br />I must say I was enthralled in the beginning and grabbed by the detail of the story telling but-somewhere about halfway through I was distracted.<br />The book didn't hold my interest anymore. All I wanted to know at that point was who done it and I felt all the trite details and over explaining of people, their jobs, descriptions and possible thoughts were boring. I felt the main character just tried too hard to save everyone.<br />It was a good story but could have been written without so much unnecessary detail. I'm not sure if I would read another book by this author.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|This watch looks a lot more expensive than it was and is very comfortable. Get quite a few inquiries on it.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|A fun read, but pretty predictable about half way through. If formatted differently, the conflict and intrigue could have been continued further into the book. I don't know how that would have been done, I'm not the author. :) Still an enjoyable read. Always like Grisham.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love the variety of the choices. There are no breaks like there is a loop repeating.  This is my favorite meditation app.

B008GVD6D8|5.0|this book was very traumatic. It shows what can happen when you let people in to help you. It relects life people insecurities and getting help to deal with them You are not alone others go through similar experirnces. Ms Day can relate to life .The book was excellent and shows there is someone outthere to love you even if you are broken.
B00007GZQI|4.0|The classic is even funnier the second time around. Peter Sellers and Ringo Star prove anyone has a price as they take down the rich snobs.
B00CXS55LG|5.0|If you took Krallice and had them hanging out with girls on the beach at sunset instead of conducting ungodly experiments on aliens or whatever it is that makes Krallice sound they way they do, you'd have Deafheaven.<br /><br />Another way of putting it is to wonder what Cloudkicker would sound like if he were into Immortal instead of Meshuggah.<br /><br />Either way, this album rips, and you've got to be some kind of dummy to not buy it and play it on repeat all summer. At the very least, you'll be able to say you were into the next big thing in Bay Area metal before all your friends were.
0399165274|5.0|Just as I used to read Michael Crichton to learn about the latest technologies weaved in twists and turns of exciting plots, Frederick Forsyth uses the latest political news to crank out great stories. This one's no exception.<br /><br />Forsyth creates characters to be well understood so that the plot can be understood, and felt. He scales down the life of a U.S. Marine General to a few pages, but detailed enough to care about him, and his son.<br /><br />The title might as well have been \\"The Kill Lists\\", because there are really two in the story: one of the U.S. Government, and the other of terrorists. When the father and the son are separated by some holy war, the lists get crossed violently.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I'M very happy to BUY these game because of its new blocks and its new features and that you can do a lot more stuff like minding Redstone ore and you can play with your friends and family members too.

Like everyone else says, it sets up the FAT table for both cards as one table, so if you pull the 2nd card and want to use it in another device, you'll have to reformat it.<br /><br />It seems to work pretty fast too, pretty much a complete pass-through for the two Micro SD cards.

B007RN07XI|3.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br /> 'Limitless' is one of those entertaining thrillers that (despite its ill-conceived ending), will appeal to the majority of ordinary males who have fantasies of becoming the kind of male women seem to automatically gravitate to: the alpha male. Indeed, the film's protagonist, Eddie Morra, the down and out novelist played by Bradley Cooper, represents an exaggerated version of the kind of situation, the average guy finds himself in, on a daily basis.<br /><br />While most guys aren't down to their last buck like Morra, they can certainly can identify with his great dissatisfaction in the inability to achieve success in a career. It's not like Morra is some bum off the street: he's got an agent but has writer's block; the average guy can relate to Morra's inability to reach his potential. The same applies to women: Morra does have a very good-looking girlfriend, Lindy--but because he doesn't reach his potential and ends up projecting a negative image, she has no guilt feelings about dumping him.<br /><br />'Limitless' allows the average male to indulge in the fantasy of becoming an instant alpha male without developing the skills. When Eddie runs into his ex-brother-in-law who gives him the illegal medication, 'NZT', we're ready to break into Act 2 and watch how Eddie is transformed. Perhaps the best scene in the movie is when Eddie must turn his brow-beating landlady around after she constantly screams at him for not paying his rent. Instead of adopting the motivational social skills of the ordinary schlub, the NZT allows Eddie to tap his full cognitive potential. Not only does he help the landlady with her paper for law school but also ends up bedding her without even trying.<br /><br />A montage with voice-over allows us to see what else Eddie accomplishes 'under the influence', including learning how to play difficult classical music pieces on the piano as well as mastering multiple languages in a matter of a few days. Instead of turning into a mensch, Eddie decides to model himself after Gordon Gekko. He starts as a day trader and begins amassing some money and this is where perhaps the first plot hole appears in the film. If he's such a genius, why does he have to borrow $100,000 from a Russian loan shark? During a voice-over, Eddie claims he needs the money fast but given his talents, couldn't the newly transformed Eddie have made that kind of money in a week or two? His financial success leads Lindy to change her mind about him and she's back in his arms in no time. Eddie also insinuates himself into the business world of business tycoon Carl Van Loon (another average performance by Robert De Niro) and is on the verge of earning millions, advising Van Loon as he's about to complete a merger with Atwood, a business rival. Eddie's transformation now appears complete.<br /><br />Screenwriter Leslie Dixon manages to keep things moving even after Eddie's transformation is finished. Since there is a limited supply of NZT, all the really bad guys are after Eddie including the loan shark and a stalker. What's more there are very bad side effects to this medication. Eddie is shocked to see his ex-wife, who is going downhill from NZT's side effects as well as discovering previous users have either died or are physically debilitated. Eddie also can't recall where he is for 18 hours and later he's implicated in a murder of a woman in a hotel.<br /><br />There's also an exciting scene where the stalker goes after Lindy. She's seemingly cornered in Central Park (of all places) by the Stalker, but Eddie advises her to take one pill of NZT, which allows her to figure out how to stop her pursuer. Her escape is exciting but contains one ugly misstep: she grabs a little girl who's skating on an ice rink, and uses her as a human machete--slashing her pursuer with the blade of the little girl's skate (I wonder why no one chased her and why she wasn't initially charged with child endangerment).<br /><br />The second act crisis is rather perfunctory, with Eddie going toe to toe with the Russian loan shark and his henchmen. There a few twists and turns in this confrontation, especially when Eddie runs out of his NZT, stabs the loan shark and is forced to drink his blood in order to get NZT back into his system.<br /><br />While a good part of this is somewhat unbelievable, it all adds up to some breezy entertainment. Unfortunately, Leslie Dixon, the film's screenwriter opts for a typical Hollywood ending, which dilutes the film's overall impact. We're asked to accept that Eddie somehow overcomes the addiction to NZT and retains his mental abilities--even though everybody else becomes addicted and goes downhill after being unable resist, after taking one pill. I also wondered why Lindy did not succumb to the effects of NZT and become an addict (I guess since she's one of the 'good ones', she has the willpower to resist).<br /><br />Finally, why should we really root for Eddie? Has he done anything good to help humanity? In the end he's a politician who rejects Van Loon, who wants to control him, even after he becomes president. But Eddie still is sleazy--after all he is a politician (not a brain surgeon!). A better ending would have Eddie sacrificing himself to save Lindy--penitence for his decision to use drugs and suck up to bad guy Van Loon.<br /><br />I enjoyed 'Limitless' up to a point. It's a fast-paced thriller, undone mainly by a cheap ending, that makes little sense.t).<br /><br />The second act crisis is rather perfunctory, with Eddie going toe to toe with the Russian loan shark and his henchmen.

B000JMKQX0|5.0|This is my first ever Brooks novel, and it was powerful. Written exceptionally, well....everything. The story line, zombies invade, post apocalyptic recount, tales of survival, death, heroism, tragedy. It was so realistic, it actually frightened me, would our government abandon us? Would we all have to change our complete way of life, actually reverting to a simpler more basic existence, just to survive. I actually started to think of my family, would we make it. Brooks really brought this home for me, I was terrified yet so engrossed I couldn't put it down.

B00C1N9JWO|4.0|I was scared to read this latest book for fear that my favorite series would be ruined. How could she write a book that illustrates love in the cold world of the Net? Ms Singh really outdid herself. This book finally answers most of my questions. The reasons (3) I only gave it 4 stars were (1) that while some Alphas make an appearance they are hardly mentioned and I felt that more pack members should have been included because of the direction the story went. Some of my favorite parts of past books is getting to catch up with characters from other books. (2) the ending was a bit abrupt and (3) the price. I hate paying so much for an ebook.
B00CVCG87O|5.0|Tesseract's second full length album is a must-have for any fan of the band, or anyone into progressive metal for that matter. Whether it's the super-tight riffing, the entrancing atmosphere of the softer sections, or the soaring and powerful vocals, there is something great about the way it all comes together with this band. I miss the harsh vocals of the first album, but not enough to make me feel any worse about the album. I thought the new vocalist did an amazing job stepping into Dan's old place, and I'm excited to see what this band will do in the future.
B00746O3X8|5.0|I kayak I've been looking for a chest level camera holder, since my Canon Mk3 is too heavy as a helmet cam. I'll use a ball head to give me the 90 degrees I need.
B00BEXB18M|1.0|This album is unacceptable.  It's worse than Risk and if you're a fan and know the band's discography, that's saying more than enough.  I don't know what Dave's plans were here, unless he wants that mainstream radio air time so bad he's willing to sell his soul, but in this case not to the Devil.  To the record company.  You know he's still comparing himself to \\"his old band.\\"  And we will be the ones who suffer until he realizes that Metallica sold out in 1991 with the Black Album and for about twenty years, probably due to Bob Rock and Lars, his old bandmates have really been struggling to not regain their sound and instead enjoy millions of dollars that most thrash bands don't have.  I have a feeling that word of mouth plus the first single from this record will be enough to kill it and hopefully it will be a giant wake-up call to Dave and Co that this is not the direction the fans will follow.  It is so bland by Megadeth standards that only the Thin Lizzy cover stands out.  Speaking of that, The Sword already covered Cold Sweat with such deadly precision that it rendered all other cover versions limp and lifeless.  In fact, if I had to choose between Supercollider and Risk, I might choose Risk.  This new album is nothing more than filler and background music.<br /><br />The lyrics are hilariously bad and cliché and don't throw out that already tired response of \\"well, what about the lyrics to Mechanix?\\"  The lyrics for Mechanix were probably written when Dave was 20 or 21.  And from that drunk and drug-addled mind, could you expect much more maturity at that time in his life?  Anyway, my friend had the music from Supercollider and we listened to it twice through, just to make sure we weren't jumping the gun on the \\"quality\\" of the record.  Fortunately, I didn't waste money on this garbage, although I may, in the future, download Cold Sweat(but I doubt it).  I've read that Dave would like to write another Rust In Peace but he can't seem to figure out how he cando it.  I think most of his die-hard fans would \\"settle\\" for another Killing Is My Business or Peace Sells, but since that definitely won't ever happen, how about getting somewhere between the sound of The World Needs a Hero / Cryptic Writings / Endgame?  This Day We Fight proved the band still has the chops to write some blistering metal when they put their minds to it.  If you want pseudo-metal that you might hear on the radio during the day while you drive to work, listen to Metallica.  Dave should take heart in that, knowing that he actually has, by his fans' estimation(and besides himself, those are the only opinions on the topic that matter) he is already better than Metallica BECAUSE for the most part, up until the release of this steaming pile, he stuck to the roots of a style of music he helped create.  When I heard The System Has Failed, I thought, no this band has failed.  Maybe three good songs and the rest was nonsense.  But even that album is hooks and skulls over Supercollider.  I was at the front of the line shouting, Dave, get back on drugs and booze, it's the only way!  But, he showed us since then that he could be Mister Christian and drug-free and still lay down some crushing music.  However, I must mention that if Tom Araya, who is Catholic, can still write the kind of music he does then Dave's newfound love of Buddy Christ shouldn't mean he can't play Bad Omen and The Conjuring anymore.  That's silly.  And, furthermore, that's probably why Slayer IS thrash.  They aren't trying to make a \\"hit\\" for the radio or \\"trying\\" to win a Grammy.  Or maybe we're looking at this from the wrong angle.  Maybe Dave just needs to pay the rent on his house and due to contractual issues he just churned out a \\"whatever\\" album just to get paid.  But I can't believe that, which is all the more frustrating because that means he actually worked at making the album this bad.<br /><br />There are no memorable riffs, and yes, Kingmaker DOES sound like Children of the Grave(no denying it).  I've been a fan of Megadeth since 1989 and I've bought all their albums, although I sold Risk almost immediately afterwards(when I stopped laughing).  Supercollider will be the first album they released in over 20 years that I didn't rush out to buy.  Don't let this be the start of your 20-plus year trend of making forgettable garbage albums like Lars and James have done.  I don't want to wait until you're 72 before you start shredding faces again.  Slayer might very well fall apart since Hanneman died, and Metallica is nothing, even if Death Magnetic seemed like a return to something like the 1980's.  That just leaves you guys.  Don't let the music go down the drain like this.  Again, only a small portion of the fanbase will find this album entertaining.  It's not thrash.  It's barely metal.  It's not Megadeth.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|Persona 4 Golden is definitely one of the Vita games that makes you NOT regret buying a Vita or not regret being a gamer. I only have 23 hours I've been playing this nonstop (I haven't touched my ps3 in awhile lol). Now I have played persona games before but never got far enough to really get into it but Golden says to me you are gonna play me and LIKE IT. That OST just reeled me in and I like games where you can get closer with your allies especially the ladies :). Battle system is turn based so if you don't like that then start liking it give this game a chance if you still are unsure about getting this then there are plently ot gameplay videos on youtube for you to look at before you make your choice. All I can say is i gave this game a chance because I did and I have no regrets I feel like Golden will keep me occupied for a long time this will be a game I keep in my collection for a long time. All I can give is positives for this game so take that money out of your wallet and buy it and remember no regrets right?. Heartbeat Heartbeat It keeps on pounding Heartbeat Heartbreak You tell me goodbye ^.^ man that song is catchy lol
B00CUWKHVI|5.0|Go to youtube for album preview.... it's very good. Amusingly enough, the song he put out the first single for (love for sale) is probably the one I like least.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|It is a very fun game however it takes way too long to update it has been months and they still haven't finished making cloud city they put in part 1 of cloud city back in March and I have seen pictures of the rest of cloud city but they haven't put them in yet * I own a Kindle FIRE HD 7&quot;*  speed racer is awesome!!!
B009AMANH4|3.0|3.5 stars. It is a little too talky for sure. There could have been more intrigue and war info passed about. But this Spielberg film is okay for what it is. There is schmaltz, almost too much in the opening scene for me to handle myself, but it gets better after that. It's not nearly as bad as some people say but yes this is a rambling film. If you don't want to hear people wandering around in costumes talking then you would do better to avoid this one.<br /><br />Period accuracy is done well. Lewis is astounding as Lincoln and gets the voice done very well. Lincoln never had a booming and deep voice! The direction is mostly solid but the weakness, it's obvious with so much attention put on it, is the script. The thing drags a bit and at times we see just a little too much sentimentality in this one. The opening scene was just a little too much for me and so are a couple more of them a little to nostalgic. All in all it is good film with excellent art direction and it pays homage to some important ideas and parts of history.
B0091QSNEE|5.0|Bought this for my 4 year old daughter. She absolutely loves to make all the food for the animals. And once I showed her that she can tap around the scenes and find new things to do, she was delighted. Quality of the game is top notch and a great value for the price.
B005VSRFEA|4.0|Meadows' book was published posthumously with editing by her colleague, Diana Wright.  I'll outline some of Wright's and Meadows' thoughts here, with a few terms and examples of my own. I recommend this book for readers who want an initial explanation of systems analysis as applied to social concerns.<br /><br />In her introduction, Wright notes that understanding the behavior of systems may be our best hope for making needed changes.  She suggests that the frustrating trends of today are often symptoms of underlying system structure, and we should make changes to the rules and communications that underlie that structure, rather than attacking a particular symptom directly.  In my own analogy, if you attack poverty only with welfare, you fail to end poverty and you get more demands for welfare.  If eliminating poverty is your goal, you need to change the system that generates poverty.<br /><br />Meadows defines a system as having elements (elsewhere called agents or actors), interconnections, and a coherent organization that achieves something.  For example, your digestive system has many elements, from throat to intestines, with chemical and nervous signals to coordinate the action.  In contrast, rocks scattered on the road are not a system.  They have no connections.  It's easier to learn about a system's elements than its interconnections, its flows of information.<br /><br />Meadows' book doesn't clearly identify emergence as a system property. However, she presents the concept that a system exhibits a behavior of the entire system, not the behavior of an individual actor.  That's the difference between a hive and one bee.  The strength of the book is its identification of the way systems fail, and the methods for altering system behavior.<br /><br />Meadows says the basic operating unit of a system is the feedback loop.  That's where an action generates a signal that may be interpreted, modified, acted upon, and changed by a sequence of the actions of other actors. Some message gets back to the first actor, perhaps after a delay.  If the feedback is positive, that is, if it rewards the initial action, then the initial action is repeated. It grows.  If the feedback is negative, the action is discouraged.  Systems in balance have positive and negative feedbacks, so the system behavior may vary, but remain in bounds.  In my analogy, the market price of putty may vary up and down, but not go to such an extreme that putty production stops.  Meadows underscores something known to every physicist and engineer: A system with an unchecked positive feedback will ultimately self-destruct.  But Meadows is not talking about electric circuits or machines.  She's applying the logic to social systems.  The collapse of entire societies has since been documented by Jared Diamond (Collapse, Viking, 2005).<br /><br />Meadows identifies the ways attempted fixes to various systems fail.<br /><br />The system may be resistant to changes in policy, as when enforcement agencies try to limit the supply of illegal drugs. In response, the suppliers increase their efforts to meet the unchanged demand of the addicts.  The solution is to give up ineffective policies, as was done during prohibition of alcohol.<br /><br />A situation like the tragedy of the commons occurs when there is no feedback or long-delayed feedback from the public to a business that consumes a non-renewable resource.  Examples are destruction of land by overgrazing, mining a mineral (e.g. oil), or dumping wastes in rivers and the atmosphere.  A business can increase its profits by extracting the resource or by dumping waste on the public.  That's an immediate positive feedback, profit for dumping.  It is the absence of timely negative feedback that causes the long-term public loss.<br /><br />The goal for a system (that is, its desired state), may become degraded if we perceive the actual state as the desired state.  When the actual state degrades, our expectation degrades, resulting in a continued degradation of the goal.  This makes me think of money, for which we want a constant value.  But, after each year's inflation, we adjust the acceptable value to be the current value, and inflation proceeds--providing a loss to those who save cash.  There's a negative feedback, but we refuse to get the message.<br /><br />A system may escalate its misbehavior when the goal of each actor is to get ahead of the other actors.  Each actor sets a goal based on the perceived state of other actors.  Escalation occurs in advertising, negative campaigning, or when hospitals compete in providing expensive facilities, costing health care customers more because facilities are not fully utilized.<br /><br />A special case of escalation occurs when winners of a competition receive the ability to compete more effectively in the future.  That's a positive feedback.  The winners get ahead, the losers lose more, and the system acts to eliminate competition.  That happens in politics, in the marketplace, and in funding for schools.  The poorest children receive the worst education.<br /><br />Sometimes, a system is based on the wrong goal.  In politics and governmental actions, the GDP (gross domestic product, called GNP in Meadows' book) is used to guide decisions.  In effect, GDP is a measure of the total money flow, not a measure of satisfaction.  If I clean your house and you clean mine, and we pay each other, the GDP increases but the real result is the same as when we cleaned our own houses.  Only the GDP changed.  Meadows points out that if the goal of society is GDP, the society will do its best to produce GDP, not necessarily producing welfare, equity, justice, or efficiency.  Meadows suggests real wealth with low resource consumption, health, and a clean environment should be the goals. Meadows saw the painful results of systemic faults.  In this writing, she appears as a loving analyst, neither an idealist or activist.<br /><br />Meadows suggests that almost every culture has a belief in its superiority over other cultures.  To me, that's south versus north within the U.S., or west versus middle-east internationally.  Beliefs are paradigms by which we set goals.  Meadows suggests individual paradigms can be changed in an instant, offering leverage points for adjusting systems.<br /><br />Because Meadows gives insightful methods for altering system behaviors without rhetoric or rancor.  I wish our leaders would read her book.  However, it's up to the rest of us to recognize the behavior of systems, and to alter the goals, rules, and information flows within the systems that frustrate us.ing in a continued degradation of the goal.

B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I am a one man IT shop so the concept of Dev/Ops might not seem very applicable in my situation because I am both Dev and Ops. However the general communication and workflow concepts are applicable to anyone. Even given the differences in company size I felt like they were describing my situation to a tee. On top of that the story was pretty well written and very enjoyable.<br />This book changed the way I work at a foundational level.
B003VXMMTK|1.0|Looked like a pretty good movie.  It ended up being sleezy.  They had to sneak the grose stuff in there.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This app is great! I think all ages will love this game. Maybe. It's worth<br /> 99 cents. Its graphics are wicked cool. You have to get it. The dark forest scares me a little but its really cool. I think you will love it.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I found myself skimming and actively looking forward to the end of both the book and the trilogy as the plot grew thinner and the filler and repetition really began to grate.  When I finally got to the cash-grab of an ending, my jaw dropped.  Get your hand out of my pocket, Sylvia Day!  I've been a huge fan of her work until now, but this is over the top.  There wasn't enough material here for three books, never mind five.  I gave two stars instead of one only because her prose and characterization continue to be miles above that of the execrable, embarrassingly juvenile EL James.  I hope Sylvia returns to writing single title Regency erotic romance, which really is her forte.<br /><br />Also,  enough with Gideon and the man-bling.  A ruby ring???  Just-no.

068485743X|5.0|Very good guide. I have recommended this book to many writer friends.  Is great to have tips and suggestions for new authors.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|The book was supposed to end a trilogy. It didn't. I am very disappointed. I've been waiting it seems like forever for this LAST book. I even reread the first two in preparation, and then I'm left hanging again!!!  That's just wrong. The story line has really taken a nose dive.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I've read all the other books and although I do agree with most of the reviewers about the quality degradation in the series I do believe that Charlaine Harris wrapped everything up the way she planned.  I don't agree with some's assessment about some of the character development which I think is fueled by couple preference bias.  It was quite clear that Sookie story is one of personal growth which showed with each relationship she encountered.  The first love with Bill, the rebound with Quinn, the bad boy/one that you hate to love with Eric and finally the true love with Sam.  Most women go through this in their relationship history and I really connected with the stories for that.  That being said some of the book did feel a bit rushed to conclude but all in all it was fast enjoyable read with no big surprises.  I did NOT like the intro of other characters narrative as I don't think Charlaine Harris is yet skilled enough to write from different perspectives.  She should have stuck to staying in Sookie's mind and habits as that is the character that she knows the best and I suspect she relates to the most. Conclusion - I'm happy to be done with this series and if you have a couple of hours at the beach or a long flight then this book will suffice.

B009XIXVU6|5.0|\\"I used to picture us as two leaves, blowing miles apart in the wind bound by the deep tangled roots of the tree from which we had both fallen.\\"  Growing up in Afghanistan, young Abdullah faces grim hardships after the death of his mother during childbirth and another baby due to the freezing cold winter.  What seems his only solace is his younger sister, Pari, who he essentially raises throughout their childhoods until one day when they're unexpectedly separated.<br /><br />I've been a fan of Khaled Hosseini's since reading the Kite Runner in high school and his newest novel does not disappoint.  His moving prose weave you through a story that spans time and place, bouncing back and forth between members of a family that have never met and in many cases don't even know each other exist.  Hosseini jumps from character to character without any explanation of how they relate to the central story at all.  Each chapter takes place in 20 years after the previous; the setting jumps from Afghanistan to Paris to California.  But we soon come to realize these are all just branches of a family tree who's strong roots will always call them back.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've tried a lot of keyboards for Android. Besides all the stock or AOSP ones including Jellybean 4.2's swype-like one and at least one that used to be my favorite because it worked well on the Incredible's retarded little brother the Eris (underpowered). There are several others like Swype, which I've never understood that it got enough attention to get included in stock ROMs, Ultra Keyboard, a few others. They all are lacking little features that SwiftKey is not.<br /><br />It is the bomb and unless they screw up, it is the end all of what typists look for in touch keyboards. My fianc&eacute; loves it, too!<br /><br />You won't be sorry.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|good game great time saver.great on the road trips. fun and addicting.like the fact that you do not have to use real life money for game.
B00BEXB18M|5.0|When I first heard the title track I thought it was good, but was not really impressed.  After giving this a good listen on a decent sound system my initial impression was wrong.  The title track has more musical depth and layers to it than any other Megadeth track that I can think of.  The core guitar riff is simple and doesn't smother the song.  The bass line that David Ellefson lays down is complex and has room to breathe behind the rhythm guitar and small lead fills are thrown in here and there with some really solid drumming.  This is a guitar driven hard rock album.  I've heard some comparisons to Risk and I just don't hear it.  I would say this album is a good cross between Countdown to Extinction and The World Needs a Hero.  Chris Broderick lays down some very memorable lead work on this one; very melodic with a touch of blues.  There's still the typical shredding but it is much more restrained making the lead work much more catchy.  Dave's vocal range isn't what it used to be but his vocals fit the material perfectly.  When I saw the song title, \\"Dance in the Rain\\", my first thought was, \\"this is gonna be lame!\\".  Well, turns out this is now one of my favorite songs that the band has recorded.  Other standout tracks are Kingmaker, Beginning of Sorrow, Don't Turn Your Back..., and The Blackest Crow.  The Thin Lizzy cover of  Cold Sweat is also fantastic.  I'm not sure it's worth the extra cash to get the bonus songs; they are the weakest on the album, but still good.  The 3D cover is actually pretty cool though.  I'd give this 4 and a half stars; highly recommended.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Seen the movie first but the book is just way better I am definitely a fan can't wait to read the next book

0061122416|5.0|I love this book. I read it for the first time 20 years ago. This year I decided to read it again and it was very powerful for me. The fact that it is done in a simple and very beautiful way, it helped me to put myself in his position and so feel the same passion.
0880793082|5.0|this deck comes packaged in a purple box - the cards are 2-7/8\\" x 4-3/8\\" which makes them easier to handle than the much larger green box edition - the cards are grey bordered (not green bordered, if that is what you're looking for)(i don't believe the green bordered cards are manufactured anymore) - this deck comes with ONE magus card (if you're looking for the deck with THREE magus cards, this is not it), the sign of crowley (a full color unicursal hexagram with the 5 petal rose in the middle) and a card with a short crowley quote about tarot and the O.T.O. address to contact them - the back of the deck shows a golden dawn/rosicrucian cross in full color - crowley includes astrological and hebrew letter correspondences on the major arcana - the pip cards (ace through ten) give the meaning on each card and astrological references (six of disks is moon in taurus and represents success for example)- the court cards are princess, prince, queen, and knight - there are no pages or kings in crowley's deck
0450035697|1.0|I was expecting what was pictured on the advert.  Instead I got the movie tie in edition with all kinds of text about how great the movie is, things about David Lynch, and pictures of what the characters look like.  I prefer to find these things out in the book and not have someones casting decision for a movie be the guiding force behind my imagination.  I didn't know I wouldn't want this book for this reason but I wish I had never ordered it from this vendor.  I ended up purchasing the much more expensive, new, mass market paperback version that has a far less interesting cover, just to be safe.  Also the damn cover is about to fall off.<br /><br />I'm sure I could have avoided this by purchasing from a more reputable location.  Or at least one that was explicit about potential versions.
B006MPKAOI|5.0|obsessive as the characters in it. I couldnt wait ti see how it ended. Buy it! you wont be dissapointed
0920236162|5.0|All kids just love his books and want them read over and over again. Great storyline!<br />I would highly recommend this book.
0307352153|5.0|This book was fascinating and a pleasure to read. I am certain that I will re-read it again and again. It isn't really a book about how introverts can act more extroverted; rather, it is a celebration of the unique characteristics and strengths of introverts. I found it to be extremely helpful and hopeful. Susan Cain possesses the ability to sort through complicated research and make it easy to understand and useful in everyday life. I particularly appreciated the many personal examples and case studies that give expression to the thoughts and experiences of introverts.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received a free copy of this book through the Blogging for Books program in exchange for my honest opinion. I was not required to write a positive review.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Although I enjoy this game it can be extremely frustrating at times. Like others I've been frozen (w/o reimbursement despite request.) I've also experienced the game setting up bingo cards to play while I'm in inventory and bought bingo coin that was not delivered I do enjoy but hey guys if I need shadow cards in order to complete a room...it would be nice to get one more often than every 24 cards.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Iron man 3 the game: great game, I've owned and played both console versions of the iron man games on Xbox 360 and I have to say I like this game most. Here's why -reason 1: graphics... I gotta say the graphics on this (on kindle fire HD and my galaxy note 2) are excellent. There's a slight lag when there's a lot going on on screen but this handles it like a champ. Reason 2: gameplay - the console versions of iron man 1&amp;2 on ps3 and Xbox360 could learn something from this great mobile game, granted you can't control iron man and fly anywhere u want or land an walk around but it's very fun flying an shooting your repulsive blast at enemies i.e aim soldiers, robots and what not. The environment is bright an color an quite detailed , like buildings billboards cars trucks . It's fun yet challenging trying to fly in and out of traffic past cars trucks and trains. Reason 3: extras - this where it's really cool, the put in a lot of different armies from the movie. This is really cool and a fun addictive game. You can buy credits for the game to unlock all the armor ,u can upgrade your weapons/ special weapons/ life bar on all the different armors. I would definitely recommend any fan of iron man or just great games in general to GET THIS GAME. - Peace out
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Very disappointed in Sylvia Day. We had to wait so long for this book to come out and when it does there was not much to it. Nothing happened then it just ended!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very creative and fun.I play it every time I get the opportunity.I recommend this for people who want to play a fun and adventures game that will knock you out your seat,if so I would recommend this specific game: SUBWAY SURFER,and it's kid friendly game ways.

B001ANSSDC|3.0|I have so many thoughts on this book that this may come out not making any sense. For this, I apologize in advance. This book was well written. I'll give the author that. The story was also quite compelling. I mean, I couldn't put it down. When I wasn't reading it I wanted to be. However, I wish I would have read some more reviews and known that this book was almost entirely about football. I hate football. I don't know anything about it. I found myself skimming through most of those parts. After finishing this book I really thought I enjoyed it with the exception of all the football crap. I loved the characters and I felt for them at times. I am just frustrated over the ending. It felt rushed and forced. I didn't see it going that way at all. I mean, I kind of expected it to but after much more had happened. I was looking for closure for Pat but he didn't get it. Throughout the entire book you read about Nikki but in the end when he sees her he doesn't do anything. That was frustrating because I feel he needed that closure. All of a sudden he is healed. He is better. Weird. Like I said, it felt forced and rushed and I feel like Pat was pretty crazy and that wouldn't change with the snap of fingers like it did. I don't know how I feel about this book. I'm left undecided mostly.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|The second book was better than the first which was excellent in its own right.  I was unable to put it down.

B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Don't advertise a set as a trilogy and provide NO resolution at the end of the third book. Was this all about making more $ with the series? That was not  well done of you. You may have lost a reader.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I love to snorkel but since I don't live in Hawaii I don't get to do it as often as I like. This game is a good substitute. The biggest problem for me is no help or manual. It sure would make it more enjoyable - I hate having to fumble along. Then there's the things you need to buy to get further along. I've bought two batches of pearls at $2 each but I don't want to have to spend much more on them. I guess that's why the game itself is free... they want to get you hooked. But the graphics are definitely worth having this; the sunlight ripples and fish fins alone are amazing! You could conceivably build a nice, small reef and then just watch and listen and that would be enough.
B0017VG69U|5.0|I love the remastered special effects. There is nothing like the original series. This season contains the best episode of any Star Trek ever, the &#34;Trouble with Tribbles.&#34;
0316228532|3.0|When I heard Joanne Rowling interviewed as this book was coming out, I was absolutely fascinated by her and by her life story.  Finally I read the first of the Potter books, enjoyed it, and could see why the concept and series of books would be such a hit among so many, young and older.  I made sure to see the movie based on that first book, as well.  I was finally in the world millions had entered years earlier.  With that step behind me, I eagerly turned to \\"The Casual Vacancy.\\"<br /><br />I think the other reader who suggested one ought to forget that the author of this book has anything to do with the Harry Potter books had it right.  However, were Ms. Rowling not the author, I probably would have given up on this book 100 pages in.  I found I had trouble keeping characters straight in my mind, all the more so because there are so many of them and because so many of them are referred to by more than one name: Andrew = Arf = Peanut, Colin = Cubby, Stuart = Fats (who is not the obese man, Howard Mollison), Parminder = Minda = Bends-Your-Ear Bhutto, Sukhvinder = Jolly = Sooks, etc.  Even \\"Sam\\" for \\"Samantha\\" left me confused given the full list of numerous characters.  Worse, there was no character I particularly liked and none that I cared about.  Nevertheless, I pushed on, noting the level of detail in Rowling's writing and how well it sticks together if one works at keeping track of the details.  I wondered if the foundation was being set for something yet to come or if I was simply missing things.  I didn't think I could press on to page 503 if nobody and nothing in the book mattered.  In fact, so many of the characters are so dysfunctional and miserable, I wondered what the author was doing writing the book.  And then, on page 242, it happened.  THEN I began to grow excited, to wonder what would happen next, eager to see if rights were wronged and cruelty morphed to kindness-- to see if anybody gained any wisdom, if anybody learned.  Reading the latter half ofthe book was not the effort reading the first half had been, though l continued to struggle with names and character attributes throughout.<br /><br />All in all, I liked the book but would be reluctant to recommend it. 242 pages is a lot of \\"build-up\\" in a 503-page book.  In fact, 242 pages could easily be the size of a book on its own.  When I had to read the \\"big\\" Russian novels in school, it was necessary to keep the many characters and their nicknames straight.  I'm no longer in school and I no longer have mandatory reading.  Generally, I read more non-fiction than fiction.  So, when I turn to fiction, I really want to read something that is entertaining or pleasant.  I sure don't want to have to work so hard at fiction!  I hope Ms. Rowling will hone her writing-for-adults craft.  I have no doubt that her next book will be better.  Even though I can't exactly say I am a fan of this book, I remain a fan of Joanne Rowling, who has my respect and admiration.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|It keeps you on your toes the whole time. You just have to play to go and out what happens.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Okay, I used to think I'd never read a book as hilarious as Seduction and Snacks. Tara Sivec had me laughing harder than I do in most comedy movies. Along comes Tangled by Emma Chase and I'm now torn as to which was funnier. What a dilemma, right?<br /><br />The chance to read from a guy's PoV is always my favorite. I mean, as a female, I KNOW how women think. It's getting into the man's head that is the treat, ESPECIALLY in the case of \\"romance\\" books. Anywho, I must say Drew Evans is more than a treat. He's like Halloween, Christmas, and Valentine's Day all wrapped up into one. He doesn't hold back ANYTHING, he's thinking. Which is good for us readers but not so much for his own cause.<br /><br />Drew is a wealthy, successful investment banker and (you guessed it) player (womanizer, male slut, etc). He never double dips and has never been interested in a relationship. He's never wanted one. During one of his typical Saturday nights filled with debauchery, he runs into a gorgeous brunette who turns him down. Of course that following Monday, we learn she is a new banker in his (father's) company. Thus begins his quest to get her into bed. From there, several things happen and of course, nothing goes according to Drew's plan. Tangled becomes a book of getting Kate the co-worker back.<br /><br />You're probably thinking this sounds boring and has already been done. I'd agree EXCEPT Emma Chase perfectly executed those stories from the other side of the fence. The narration is absolutely BRILLIANT. Seriously. The voice of Drew is so witty and funny, plus the way the story is told makes it as if you're standing alongside him throughout. He constantly says things such as, \\"Let's just pause here again, shall we?\\" and you not only feel as though you're watching these things take place, but also that you're a part of them.<br /><br />There are entirely too many hilarious lines/quotes for me to mention, but one that had me rolling early on is:<br />\\"No, I haven't f***ed her.<br />Not that I wouldn't love to. Trust me, if she didn't work for me, I'd hit that harder than Mohammed Ali.\\"<br />Funny? Hell yes. Inappropriate? Definitely. And that's the beauty of it. This book is filled with offensive comments and jokes. I loved it. Tangled is truly sheer brilliance. I won't post any spoilers, but will say that one of the funniest scenes happens at a family dinner (Thanksgiving, I believe). The addition of a four-year old girl makes this all the better.<br />OH! Before I forget, another reason this book is the shizz?? It references several kick ass movies. Which ones?<br />1. Pretty Woman<br />2. The Notebook<br />3. Alien<br />4. The Little Mermaid<br />5. BEAUTY AND THE BEAST - and may I add, he compared Kate to Belle because she was gorgeous and smart. :)<br /><br />Tangled is a superbly written novel. I loved that we start in the present and go back in time to see how things played out.<br /><br />SIDE NOTE:<br />This book WILL cause a book hangover. It's one of those that is SOOOOOOOO good it becomes hard to choose or even get involved in another story immediately after reading it.br />Not that I wouldn't love to.

0345457692|5.0|I've read this twice now, and I will probably come back another time. It's like trying to describe a roller coaster ride.<br /><br />The best thing about Morgan is his grasp of crime fiction. That isn't my thing, usually, but you get immersed in it here within a science fiction world that is fully realized. Some of the whodunnit, page-turning suspense was lost after the first read, and in retrospect, the killer seems obvious -- but to heck with that. As with William Gibson and cyberpunk, perhaps it's the coked-up style and verve that count with Morgan the most.<br /><br />The dialogue crackles with tension, and every character comes alive through their language. The attention to detail reflects Tak's tastes as a combat connoisseur. We may not like him, but this is the world he lives in, and the world that made him.<br /><br />The body-changing aspect is a great hook for a noir crime story, and Morgan takes that and goes full throttle. Blood spatter and raunch don't hurt, but rather fit right into this seedy world. This isn't an \\"idea\\" driven science fiction story, but what is thought provoking is a world of space travel and body switching technology where (at least on Earth) the basest human behaviors run rampant. Readers may be offended by what they see here--but maybe we can't judge this \\"advanced\\" world by morals that were left behind long ago. Oddly, we accept such grit and ambivalence in \\"A Game of Thrones\\" -- \\"because that's the way things really were in the Middle Ages\\" -- but not so much in SF. Who's to say our future selves will be any better than we always have been? Technology may not make us better, but worse.<br /><br />The other novels in the series kind of lose some of the steam built up in this one, but that just highlights how entertaining this novel is. Too bad it never got out of the option stage and made it into a film. It's kind of an anti-CGI throwback, and it calls for the macho, gritty, on-the-edge directing of someone like the late Sam Peckinpah.
B006M4F67A|1.0|This app did not work as it was should have. I'd click on tiles that were the same and should have been removed by the game but they would remain. But when I clicked on some tiles that were different from each other they disappeared. The game also took a long time to come up on the screen after being selected. There needs to be some software glitches fixed before I'll download it to my tablet again.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is a whole lot more fun and addicting then I thought it would be. Can't....stop....playing.  So fun and surprisingly hard!
B009NY43NY|5.0|I hated to put the book down when I finished it. I have so enjoyed the books about Sookie Stackhouse and her wild and other-worldly friends. I hate to see the series end but Sookie has certainly earned the right to have a sane and peaceful life after everything that happened to her. Charlaine Harris has a marvelous imagination and a wickedly creative sense of humor. It has been a 'fangtastic' ride.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Harold denied his emotions, buried the pain, resisted love, didn't discuss his feelings, found no enjoyment, himself unacceptable, merely existed through childhood, adulthood, marriage, parenthood, career, and now retirement.  When he learned that the one person who had tried to be kind to him, to accept him for just who he was, was dying, he had to speak to her.  While traveling to see her he began to overcome his pain, feel his feelings, experience love and learn to accept himself.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Lots of fun, kept me busy for a few days and I have a lot of free time to play games. I liked the story and the the puzzles were a good challenge.
B00338QENI|5.0|Warning: reading this book will turn even the most OCD-driven neat freak into a bona fide slob.<br /><br />A sink filled with dirty dishes, the clutter of the week unsorted and piled high on the dining room table, and not a single pair of clean undies to be found...This is my house, and I lay all the blame on Rebecca Skloot. If she hadn't written such a fascinating and utterly absorbing book I would have been far more productive this week.<br /><br />I'd write more about The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, but now that I'm done reading, I'm suddenly drawn by the irresistible the urge to clean. In a nutshell, the book interweaves a plethora of compelling topics, including the history of racial injustice in our country, family ties and conflicts, medical ethics, the line between spirituality and superstition - and more. It raises a number of interesting questions, like What rights does a patient have over his cells once they've been extracted from his body? and Would giving patients more rights over their tissues impede scientific progress?<br /><br />The unique story of Henrietta Lacks' cells and the way her family was subsequently affected is completely engrossing, heartbreaking, riveting, and sometimes maddening. And Rebecca Skloot tells the story with a thoughtful and judicious voice that is neither oppressive, nor preachy, but present - in just the right way.<br /><br />As I spend the next few days sorting, sudsing and sifting my way through this poor, neglected house, I'm pretty sure I'll still be dwelling on this book. It's gonna stay with me for a while!
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|I have read the first three books in this series and the books were very good. I liked this series as well as the Twilight series, I am not a hater of either. I had to see the first movie twice before I made up my mind about how much I liked the movie. The reason was that the movie is different than the book. I think this is a problem that most people who read the first book had with the movie. I have read so many books that have been made into movies that I have stopped comparing the books to the movies. I now just watch the movie and decide if I like it or not. I enjoyed seeing the first book come to life even though some things were changed. I loved the southern accents and southern regional things, it was somehow more pronounced in the movie than in the book-I didn't hear the southern accents when I was reading the book. The most important thing was that the romance and mystery of the storyline work and it did for me. The movie was made differently but was still cohesive for a young audience. Some things were also simplified/streamlined for a general audience, I am OK with that though. It is a shame that the movie didn't do better at the box office. I am guessing that the next three books won't be made into movies. If you liked the first movie, I recommend that you read the other books if no sequel movies are made.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The extent to which you enjoy Khaled Hosseini's new novel \\"And the Mountains Echoed\\" is entirely contingent upon your expectations. If you are expecting a novel that contains the kind of figurative language that makes you wonder why you would ever spend a minute doing anything other than reading literature, you will probably be disappointed. If you are expecting a novel that contains a plot you will remember three months from now, you will probably be disappointed. If you are expecting a novel that contains characters who are as real as the person sitting next to you, you will probably be disappointed.<br /><br />But, if you want a novel you can get lost in as you languish on a crowded Memorial Day beach, the kind that engrosses you despite the sunscreen in your eyes, the rap music in your ears and the sand in your suit, this is the one for you.<br /><br />\\"And the Mountains Echoed\\" arrived in my mailbox exactly one day before I left for a beach vacation, and its compelling narrative, thoughtfully rendered themes and tear-jerking ending were just the perfect escape. If \\"Crime and Punishment\\" is a beautiful, sixty-year-long marriage built upon mutual love, admiration and respect, well, then, this novel is more of a week-long junior high school romance. You probably won't remember it ten years from now, but--hey, it was fun.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|This book has been heavily anticipated and I think it delivered. It's always great to have a male lead like Gideon back. Sylvia Day has always written him pretty consistently and she once again did not fail. I did see that this series will span a total of five books, and maybe that's why there were some many different plot lines. Between Nathan's murder, the reporter, Corinne, Anne Lucas, Eva's parents, Brett FREAKING Kline, Cary's dilemma, Megumi, and *SPOILER* Eva's sex tape, it felt like a lot to take in. I could see how someone would feel it was dragged out. I think if you loved the first two, this is a great addition to the series and you'll be sure to enjoy it. I guess it's personal preference in regards to how you feel about having so many events and developments occurring. This book is certainly busier than the first two. I am interested in seeing these plot lines close up and being resolved, while uncovering more of Gideon's past and unveiling the secrets he holds.<br /><br />I gave it four stars (4.5 actually but I can't do that and I'm not a \\"rounding up\\" kind of chick) because it was still an interesting read and had plenty of things going for it. I think there's gradual growth in both Eva and Gideon in terms of their ability to trust one another. If there's one thing I want for the next two books is to see Eva and Gideon deal with their issues without so many outside influences. I am mostly pleased that Sylvia Day tells the story by days and doesn't skip weeks or months ahead. There's sheer delight in that sort of structure.<br /><br />And God do I hate the character of Brett Kline. Reduce the fraction buddy, 2/3!
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|I'm really intrigued by how critical movie goers seem to be - one star?  Really?  What a completely illogical interpretation of a visually stunning movie.  STID in no way deserves anything close to a 3 star or lower - it is not \\"average\\" nor are the actors, characters, or CGI.  As a lifelong Trekkie I honestly think most Trekkies won't be disappointed if they allow the movie to be judged on it's own merits.  I love Z. Quinto's interpretation of Spock - he's awesome to say the least.  I think this is the most visually beautiful, technically tantalizing Star Trek to date.  5 big fat stars - for an impeccably well done movie.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I wonder if Ms Day realizes she just shot herself in the foot.!!  SHE SHOULD PAY THE READERS TO READ THIS B______.<br />WORDS CAN NOT EXPRESS MY DISGUST AFTER READING THIS<br /><br />I was totally disappointed in the beginning of this book. After waiting almost 8 months to read what I thought would be the completion of what started out as my favorite series thus far I was highly disappointed that book three didn't not pick up exactly where BOOK two concluded. Seriously ? And why not? Come on Sylvia the whole story line at the beginning of this book should have been the reactions to each other Eva and Gideon had after learning the truth and should have centered around that meeting in the hallway. Now I find out that the story is not finished yet. REALLY? There was a lot of useless info thrown at us in the book with nothing being truly solved. All Eva could seem to talk about was how sexy Gideon was but that didn't stop her from lusting after another man. Really?? Well at least they are married now but Gideon still treats her like she is insignificant at times. And if she cheats on Gideon with Brett in the next book then that's just wrong. In my opinion this should have been the conclusion to what was a wonderful story instead of more months waiting and more money spent to find out how it ends. UGGGHHHHHH!!!!<br /><br />I am seriously disappointed in this turn of events for this series. This appears to be just useless info used a fillers that should have been tossed out by the publisher instead of used to milk more money out of the readers.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I was so excited this morning thinking this book was going to be on my Kindle from my pre-order. As it turns out I hadn't pre-ordered this so before purchasing I decided to read the reviews. I'm so disappointed to find out that book 3 is not the end and doesn't have the happily ever after. I have decided not to buy this book. I don't want to be invested in another 2 books drug out for another year and possibly still be disappointed. Totally bummed.
B007SGM084|4.0|Beyond all of the descriptive sex scenes, this is really a story about love, relationships, introspection, inner-peace, & growth. I could relate to those themes, & in so doing, I wanted to continue reading, to see how the characters' lives would be resolved. The storyline is often soap operatic in its flair for the dramatic (attempted kidnapping, stalking ex-lovers, ransom threats, etc.), but that annoying truth didn't detract from the real story for me.
0307744434|5.0|What an incredible book! The author builds this magical world and sucks you right in. The ending did not disappoint except to say I was sad it was over. I highly recommend this book!!

B00CL68QVQ|1.0|... well, maybe the silver lining is that you can almost be certain, any other movie you ever watch, won't match the fail that is jam-packed in this one.<br /><br />My friend, she wanted to rent this movie and [[ASIN:B00BSBT8M6 Life Of Pi]]. So we rented both movies. To be honest, I didn't want to watch either one. However, to my surprise, Life of Pi was pretty decent. This one, I can't really put to words how bad it really is. The acting is weak, the direction is horrid, the dialog goes from pedestrian to down right crummy, the casting ... well.<br /><br />My friend, she fell asleep during the movie. I tried to watch through it, giving it a chance to redeem itself, but it was hopeless.<br /><br />If you like crap movies, you'll enjoy this one. Otherwise, this isn't even worth the $1.20 rental from the kiost at your local supermarché.

Super Collider is an amazing collection of music and Megadeth proves yet again why they are better than Metallica.  Don't get me wrong, I like Metallica, but Megadeth is superior and Super Collider is better than I expected.

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I connected this mouse, and it immediately felt good. I do some gaming, but I really bought it because of the blue lights. I just finished building an extreme machine I-7  and all. I used the blue LED's inside my computer and this mouse matched. Thereafter, I love the feel and did add all the weights. But my problem with the mouse was as all of us do, I didn't read the directions.  Well, this mouse during boot defaults to the 8000 dpi setting, and I have an Intel extreme motherboard with visual bios, and mouse controlled. However, at 8000 DPI, it is impossible to use this device in the bios because it is too fast. So I boxed it up and put it away. Last night I watched a youtube video about this mouse where the Britt actually explained how to use it, and where the DPI switch was. I had to know because I liked the feel so well, I wanted it to work. Thereafter I reconnected it and ralalized that once into the bios I could switch the DPI from 8000 back to 2000, and it worked fine. If you buy one, do not give up, watch the video, because this is actually one of the best working mice I have ever owned. I love it and will continue to use to use it, and for the price I give it 5 stars, because it is a real winner with many settings, and it feels so goooood in your hand.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I chose to read this book because it had good reviews and because the movie looked enticing. It was an excellent read that didn't drag. Captivating enough to keep me interested and easy enough to read while on the elliptical at the gym. Can't wait to see the movie now.

1451695195|4.0|In this book a miracle unfolds before your eyes.  Dr. Eben Alexander, a highly trained, highly respected neurosurgeon, is stricken inexplicably by bacterial meningitis which utterly destroys the neocortex of a brain, that part that makes us human.  He had a ten percent chance of surviving, and even if he did, would probably spend the rest of his life in a vegetative state.  He fell into a deep coma and while comatose journeyed to another realm where he discovered a world awash in love and beauty more real than anything we know here on earth.  After almost a week in a coma, as his family and attending physicians were preparing themselves for his death, he wakes up with his brain unbelievably undamaged and burning to share his experience with others.  The author is a brain surgeon, a trained observer and his story is an affirmation of life after death for Christians and others who believe in it, and a very persuasive case for those who don't.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|Very well written.  Making death the narrator was genius.  I hated to see it end in spite of the sadness of the story.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I loved this book! Defiantly a great ending to a great series. Can't wait to start hero's of Olympus. I think this is the best book in the series that just goes to show you should save the best for last!
B00BEXB18M|1.0|Mustaine has lost his snarl. Besides Kingmaker, this album is woeful. Mustaine sounds like a gurgling old man. He was brilliant when he was an angry man...but this is just plain crap. Some of the lyrics in these songs are very Dr.Suess like...I'm a big fan of Megadeth but this is just as bad as 'Risk'.

B002S0OBN2|3.0|And as an artist, I have the utmost respect the work of others. If you like are work, great- then it's for you. If you don't like it, it's not the end of the world.<br /><br />HOWEVER!<br /><br />Though I refuse to critique Love Never Dies, I can honestly say that I still haven't got my fix. I would willingly pay to see a \\"high budget\\" sequel. I don't know about the rest of you, but I can turn a blind eye to everything I saw in Love Never Dies and write it off as an alternate reality to the original. It's not far fetched, it has been done time and time again with the Superman series.<br /><br />In order for this to happen, Mr. Webber needs to come to the realization that yes, he worked hard on Love Never Dies, but he CAN and WILL do better- if not for the sake of his fans or his legacy, then do it for the sake of the story! He's probably too busy to read reviews on Amazon so someone close to him is going to have to convince him that the story is more important than his pride.<br /><br />A SUITABLE SEQUEL must indeed have original scores, but also pay homage to the original themes. I can't begin to tell you how many times I longed for the phantom to call Raoul an \\"Insolent boy, you slave of fashion!\\", or for the grand finale where everyone is singing Point of No Return. The producers must realize that this is what WE want and the story needs. It wouldn't be hard to do as the melodies are already written. Someone needs to tell the producers that their place is in an office... Well, you know the rest.<br /><br />Good job Mr. Webber, I enjoyed Love Never Dies. I hope this message finds it's way into your head. Don't do to Phantom what George Lucas did to Star Wars. My love for your music never dies.

The vocalists are superb and the huge choir ensemble brings an intensity to the music not felt in &#34;just the musical&#34;.  Some of the most fabulous music and words of any musical any time.  Especially fabulous is Alfie Boe.  FAB-U-LOUS!  I have watched it over and over again and listen when doing other things in the house.  If you love musicals, this concert DVD (or CD) is a MUST!

1781162646|5.0|21 year old college student Devin Jones is spending the summer of 1973 in Heaven's Bay, North Carolina, a seaside town whose claim to fame, at least in the summertime, is the amusement park called Joyland. Devin just happened to see the want ad for Joyland while still at school at the University of New Hampshire, and with his girlfriend Wendy, who's gotten her own summer job far away, he figures it's as good a place as any to spend the summer. Little does he know just how much that summer will change his life.<br /><br />Joyland is no Disney, or even Six Flags, but it's a decent sized park, run by seemingly decent people, and Devin can't help but be excited about starting on what promises to be a bit of an adventure. He immediately meets Lane Hardy, who runs the massive Carolina Spin, and who takes Devin under his wing. Then there's the forthright Madame Fortuna, who is the resident fortune teller, but who also may be a true seer. Soon, Devin has his hands full with the hustle and bustle of the park, and it does much to keep his mind off the increasingly elusive Wendy, who seems to be doing her best to avoid him, never mind the geographic distance. When she finally sends him a Dear Devin letter, he's devastated. Luckily, he's got Joyland.<br /><br />While nursing his heartbreak, he throws himself into work, and it's an effective way to keep his mind off of Wendy, most of the time. He even rather enjoys \\"wearing the fur\\", which consists of donning a suit of the park's mascot, Howie the Happy Hound and entertaining the hoardes of kids that stream through the park. He's got a knack for it, and he comes to love the work; not only as Howie, but also running the concessions, working the rides and even doing rougher jobs like custodial and maintenance. It's all part of the job, and combined with his new friends, the lovely Erin (a Hollywood Girl-I believe that's her on the cover), and Tom, both residents of the quaint and charming Mrs. Shoplaw's Beachside Accommodations,  it's shaping up to be a decent summer, except for that heartbreak thing. Not to worry, though, before you can blink, Devin will have much more than just work on his plate. He soon becomes caught up in a murder that occurred four years prior, in the darkest part of the Horror House ride. A young girl's throat was cut and she was left for dead beside the tracks. The killer was careful, and got away, his identity a mystery,but was she the only one? It's definitely a question for Devin to ponder, besides, of course, the identity of the killer. Devin tells himself it's just idle curiosity, and nothing will possibly come of it, right?<br /><br />First of all, before I go any further, I'm firmly in the \\"Stephen King is a genius\\" camp of readers. I have no shame and just wanted to get that out there. That said, I do have my favorites, and a few of his past titles have even fallen a little flat for me. I have no problem admitting if one of his books is a miss. However, Joyland is NOT a miss. In fact, it's probably one of the best of his I've read, ever. Joyland, coming in at just under 300 pages, is a poignant, beautifully told coming of age story, with a damn creepy murder mystery in the mix. Joyland is told by Devin 40 years after the events of the novel, and occasionally he inserts his view of certain situations with the eyes of an older, wiser man, and this serves to make the narrative even richer. And rich it is! I don't know anyone that's not even a little bit interested in carny life, and I'm fascinated with it. I loved reading about Devin's day to day at Joyland, and how he comes to care for the people and the park that he's spending so much time with. The running of the park is like a carefully choreographed Broadway show, each person an important part of an intricate dance and for the most part, the people that work at Joyland are like family, and treat one another as such. Joyland sells fun, after all, and it turns out that fun is a pretty serious business, and certainly not for the faint of heart!<br /><br />For the most part, Joyland is about the summer on the North Carolina coast that young Devin Jones experiences his first real heartbreak and joins a very different family, including a young boy with a terminal illness and his mother. But, there's a shadow looming over Joyland, and it's the brutal murder of a young girl that happened not so long ago. All of these things combine into a perfect storm (literally and figuratively) to culminate in a climax that will knock your socks off. It's the little things in Joyland that makes it wonderful and the humanity of King's characters that elevate it far above the usual crime fare. You'll want to settle in and read this one all the way through. Yes, it's that good, and my only complaint is that I wanted more. Joyland is a standout of the genre, and an absolute stunner of a novel that will break your heart and send chills down your spine in equal measure!rtainly not for the faint of heart!<br /><br />For the most part, Joyland is about the summer on the North Carolina coast that young Devin Jones experiences his first real heartbreak and joins a very different family, including a young boy with a terminal illness and his mother.

Having said that though, Megadeth is, and shall forever remain my favorite band of all time.

I think all the extra stuff is really cool .I love the little bombs &amp; am really appreciative that they do not blow up the candy. And I really love pausing time. Like, we can go back in time,now we can STOP it?! Plus, I didn't notice the superpower thing on the original version when I had it a year ago, so I was like, &quot;What can be more fun than herding candy toward frogs?&quot; If you are thinking of getting the original game, I don't know if the superpower thing was added since I played it. And then the blades. The only thing I can say is, does anybody out there know anything more ironic than a blade in a bubble, I want to hear it. So I guess I can summarize  this by saying BEST GAME EVER!!

0618001905|5.0|Hochschild, Adam - King Leopold's Ghost: A Story of Greed , Terror and Heroism in Colonial Africa - 1998<br />Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co.<br /><br />The story begins with the observations of Edmund Dene Morel, a shipping clerk working in Antwerp, in the late 1880's. He noticed that there were no real \\"trade goods\\" going back to the Kongo after shiploads of goods and raw materials had been off-loaded. What was being sent South were guns, machine guns, cannons, bullets and soldiers - not even food to feed them; that they would take from the people who lived there. He learns quickly the explanation for the source of these goods - slave labor.<br /><br />Even in the late 1400's, people of the Kongo were polygamists, something the white Europeans considered dreadful. In 1482, Diego Cao sailed past the mouth of a huge river, so large it appeared to be part of the ocean, except the water it contained was fresh, some 10 miles out at sea. The mighty river would eventually be dubbed the Congo.<br /><br />It would take another 9 years (1491) before the first white `missionaries' would set up court in the capitol in the town of Mbanza Kongo, a 10 day walk in from the mighty river's orifice emptying into the Southern Atlantic Ocean.<br /><br />These strange new white arrivals had found in place many civic institutions; governors, judges, and many other ranks of people who kept order amongst the constantly feuding tribes inhabiting the area. They didn't know the wheel or writing, but they did know slavery, most of those people being captured in feuds or open warfare, which tended to be short lived.<br /><br />When a fleet of Portuguese ships was blown off course in 1500, the explorers found an entirely new continent, practically void of people. Being the accommodating types they were, the Portuguese quickly established towns in this new world, and the need for labor to build those towns and exploit the new continent set in motion what marked the beginning of the slave trade in the Kongo. It would endure for the next 350 years.<br /><br />The Portuguese were the first slave traders, and enjoyed a virtual monopoly on the trade for nearly a century. In 1600, the Dutch, English and French were plying the coasts of Africa, looking for more slaves. The overall effect of the slave trade ruined what shaky institutions the Kongo kings governed, and the last King, Alfonso, who had converted to Christianity, wrote and spoke Portuguese and ruled the loose affiliation of tribes that comprised what was left of the government. The slave trade brought that all to an end, so that by the time of his death in 1540, his kingdom was in tatters.<br /><br />In 1665, the Army of the weakened Kingdom fought a losing battle with the Portuguese, and the Mani Kongo, the last king, was beheaded, inspiring more internal strife, until the colony was taken over by European countries by the late 1800's.<br /><br />The Congo River discharges 1.4 million cubic feet of water per second into the Atlantic , seconded only by the mighty Amazon, which drains 70% of the South American landmass. The rivers headlands are a vast upland plateau nearly 1,000 feet high, descending to the ocean through a vicious set of rapids some 220 miles long. This made the river unnavigable; it had 32 separate cataracts, deep canyon walls that propelled the broiling water into waves that reached 40 feet in height. The river has more hydroelectric potential than all of the lakes and rivers in the US combined, and runs at virtually the same velocity year round. Its total watershed would prove to be some 1.3 million square miles, and the reason for its year round fullness was found to be that at some point, either North or South of the Equator, the rivers watershed enjoyed a year long rainy season, and thus, no diminishing of its power or velocity, unlike the Amazon, whose water levels and flow dropped precipitously during the dry season.<br /><br />Events in other parts of Africa started unfolding withthe discovery of diamonds in South Africa in 1867, and vast quantities of gold 2 decades later. We meet Henry Morton Stanley, with the birth name of John Rowlands, an illegitimate scion of Welsh birth who never knew his father and was orphaned out by his mother at the age of 6. He had an aptitude and talent for writing while attending this social welfare school, and by the time he was 17, he had managed to hire himself out as a seaman on a cargo ship headed for the United States. He jumped ship when they arrived in New Orleans and disappeared from the eyes of the Captain, whence he befriended an influential New Orleans businessman, and began a new life as an American.<br /><br />Upon his sponsor's death some 6 years later, he had no trace of an accent left, but a strong desire for adventure. Stanley then worked for the New York Herald as a writer, and he was good at what he did. The papers at the time were full of stories about a man who had gone missing in Africa, for nearly 6 years, a Scottish Congregationalist medical missionary, Doctor David Livingston. Stanley was sent to find him by his editor in 1869 and secured passage on a boat for Africa that would lead him to fame and fortune, at the peril of almost everyone he came in contact with (if you happened to be African).  He found Dr. Livingston, who had been searching for the source of the Nile River, some 2 years later, and uttered those famous words, \\"Doctor Livingstone, I presume...\\" in the village of Ujiji, an Arab settlement on the Eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika on November 10, 1871. The words were printed in an editorial appearing in the Herald on August 10, 1872, but may have been a fabrication, for Stanley had torn those pages out of his diary, erasing the details about their first meeting.<br /><br />Stanley embarked on a mission to find the headwaters of the Nile River, moving deep within the jungle with his train of porters. It would be some time before he found a great river, which would prove tobe the Congo, but he had found a river that was wide and full, and flowed North, until it meandered South some weeks later, and he was bitterly disappointed. But he followed the River through its course, slaughtering villagers along the way for food, and eventually came out in the Atlantic Ocean some 2 years later. He was the first white man to traverse Africa from East to West, and sent dispatches to his editor about his journey, which were widely read on both sides of the Atlantic.<br /><br />He had become a celebrity in those Victorian times, booked for speeches about his adventures in Africa. As such, he drew the eye of the king of a tiny European country who was desperate to extend his empire in the age of colonization, which he was already almost too late to join. He even tried to buy colonies from dwindling Spain and Portugal, all to no avail. His name was King Leopold II of Belgium.<br /><br />Leopold recruited Stanley after he invited him to his palace in Brussels. He was lavishly reimbursed and paid for his services, and returned to the Kongo to explore and claim for the king all the lands and tributaries of the great river for him. It would become known as the Congo Free State, a cruel euphemism for what was to come.<br /><br />Leopold also used the services of Civil War `General' Henry Shelton Sanford, a wealthy Connecticut heir to the company who provided many of the Unions cannon during the war, and was appointed by Lincoln American Ambassador to Belgium in 1864. When then President of the United States Chester Arthur traveled to Florida for a vacation away from the cold of Washington in April of 1883, Stanton was there to lobby for the recognition of the Congo Free State in Leopold's behalf. By the time he had finished with the President, Congress and several members of the Senate, he had bamboozled Leopold's dream of Colony into reality - the United States became the first country to officially recognize the new, philanthropic nation of the Congo, under a thinly veiled guise that the natives would welcome the move under his newly formed philanthropic society.<br /><br />George Washington Williams became the first great dissenter of what he described as Leopold's rape of the land and subjugation and slaughter of the native population. As a wounded Civil War veteran, he was especially angry that so few hopes of the war that ended slavery had been realized. He was one of the first Black Activists in America.<br /><br />By July 18th, 1885, after nearly 2 years in the Congo (he would spend almost 15 years there), he held no illusions of what Leopold had instituted, in a dozen page letter to Leopold which would have had his head on a pike in earlier times, or later times. In these times, however, Leopold deflected, as he was an expert at the art of deflection of the truth.<br /><br />Stanley called Washington's `Open Letter' a deliberate attempt at blackmail. As the premier racist and obfuscator of the 19th century, Stanley's opinions carried considerable weight amongst the people who had read any of his wildly popular novels of `Darkest Africa' and the people who inhabited the continent. They were intended to be subjugated by their sheer lack of initiative, he thundered. The death tolls of porters conscripted for missions to the interior were staggering - in many cases 100% of the original members of the party.<br /><br />Washington died on August 2, 1891 of tuberculosis in Blackpoole, England, where he was unceremoniously buried in an unmarked grave.<br /><br />Such was Leopold's legacy in the Congo, where the life of the natives had no value to the white administrators. \\"Chicotte\\" (a whip made from the hide of the Rhinoceros) was the only justice administered to any and all slave bearers. The European outlook on the Negro race was one of inferior beings; lazy, uncivilized, little better than animals.<br /><br />The rubber trade in the Congo is another matter entirely, where Leopold amassed more money than Rockefeller and Carnegie combined. He had always loved his palaces and public monuments to himself, but as the years dragged on, he purchased vast areas in the Cote Azure, bought a huge yacht, and married a 19 year old French Prostitute who bore him 2 children. He was estranged from his wife, the Queen and three daughters, one of whom was married to Maximilian, until he met his end at a firing squad in Mexico when he tried unsuccessfully to establish rule in that war torn land.<br /><br />The politics of empathy are fickle. What happened in the Congo was indeed mass murder on a vast scale, but the sad truth is that the men who carried it out for Leopold were no more murderous than many other Europeans then at work or war elsewhere in Africa.<br /><br />Mr. Hochschild gives the reader considerably more than they would suppose the book is all about - it's well researched, brilliantly written and pieced together in a manner that is easy to follow but will make you sick at what civilization did to other human beings, and their attitudes toward an entire continent.  The estimates of those worked to death or slaughtered outright are staggering - conservatively put at 10 million people. I hope its very hot where Leopold now makes his home, for he was societies first great mass murderer.
B005SAZ8SG|4.0|I really liked this old musical. The acting, singing and dancing were wonderful. I thought Donald O'Connor was great in this movie. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves the old movies from the past.
B004AGI2L4|4.0|In a year characterized by many high-quality, gritty historical / quasi-historical action movies, this is the most Hollywood of the bunch:  the most bedecked with big-caliber actors, the most slickly produced, and the most spectacular in terms of visual impact.  None of that counts against it.  It holds its own admirably against such contenders as &#34;Black Death,&#34; and provides some neat glimpses into the tribal past of Britain.  Highly recommended for those with an ability to deal with a certain amount of violence and gore.

B00BEXB18M|4.0|Listen carefully Mega-fans. Let's all take a deep breath...everything is going to be alright...<br /><br />Man, some of the fans are pissed about this album! Let me start by saying I am NOT one of them. I've had this album for a couple of days now (I got my copy a little early from the Cyber Army) and I have to say it's growing on me in a big way. When I heard the first single, the title track \\"Super Collider\\", I admit I was a bit surprised - it just didn't have the same punch that the last few title tracks have had and I felt like it came completely out of left field, but once I heard the album in it's entirety it didn't feel so out of place. Is \\"Super Collider\\" the crushing METAL that we got from \\"United Abominations\\", \\"Endgame\\" or even \\"Th1rt3en\\"?...not even close, but this is an album that can be appreciated purely on it's own merits.<br /><br />Megadeth is predictably unpredictable and this time out gives us a Hard Rock/Metal album - it has some serious hooks and a real Rock 'N' Roll feel to it, and in my opinion, it's executed with excellent Megadeth style.  I think that so many of us fans want our Metal Gods to give us the same ol' album each and every outing that we don't leave them any room to stretch their creative muscles and bring us something a little off the beaten path.  For me \\"Super Collider\\" is just that - something different... in a good way.  I can hear a lot of Dave's early influences here and get the feeling that he just wanted to groove.  I'll be the first fan to admit I prefer the brain melting riffs off albums like \\"Rust In Peace\\" and \\"Endgame\\" but I feel like this album has it's place as well.  So far my favorite songs are \\"Dance In The Rain\\", \\"Off The Edge\\", \\"Built For War\\" and the Bonus Track \\"A House Divided\\".  I'm also digging the cover of Thin Lizzy's \\"Cold Sweat\\", that song in particular sums up the overall feel of the album for me, I think it was just time for Dave to feed the Rock a bit more than the Metal!<br /><br />I've been a Megadeth fan since 1986 and have stuck with them through all the ups and downs. They are THE premiere thrash band that gave us the classic \\"Peace Sells...\\", the thrash genre defining \\"Rust In Peace\\" and the metal mayhem of \\"Endgame\\". They're also the band the gave us some MTV/radio friendly master works like \\"Countdown to Extinction\\" and \\"Cryptic Writings\\" and everything else in between.  I don't think anyone should be shocked that they put out an album like \\"Super Collider\\", it fits what Megadeth is all about - doing what feels right in the moment.  Is every single song that Dave and Co. ever released absolutely perfect? The short answer is no, but we're definitely talking about a band that consistently delivers the goods. That being said, this album is far from a let down - I just think it needs to be approached with an open mind. There are some great songs here - so let go of your preconceived notions of what Megadeth should always sound like and allow yourself to enjoy this record for what it is - a moment in time from a legendary band!

B00A8ECU24|2.0|This game is very fun, but Gameloft should be ashamed of it. In this game, the 'premium' currency is gems. These are very hard to earn without spending ridiculous amounts of real money. The cheapest is 20 gems for $2. Well, Rarity and Rainbow Dash cost 70-90 gems for, and you have to have them to complete the game. And they're cheap. Princess Celestia cost s 950 gems. Do they expect us to pay these ridiculous amounts of real money for these over-priced pixels? Shameful. And little kids will only get frustrated or spend hundreds of dollars on your credit card by accident. You will get hours of fun out of this game, that is until you get stuck on a quest to get Rarity for 70 gems that you have to do to continue. Go ahead and try the game, but expect frustration. Lots of frustration. You would expect nice, cheap fun from My Little Pony; but no, they only want your money.

The reality is I was looking forward to an ending too but I am a Sylvia Day fan and read for months now that she had so much for to add to the love story so she didn't think it would end on 3 books.<br /><br />If you didn't read the books, then I don't really think the rating helps us that do want to read or buy know what you think.  There are more than 3 books so if you are mad... you have the option of NOT buying!!<br /><br />I am looking forward to more of Eva and Gideon!  So I'm adding 5 stars on here because I know the books is not 2 or 3 stars people!!  Come on!
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is very cute, and it's very fun to breed your dragons to get new ones! It's a lot of waiting (it can take hours for eggs to hatch), but is very much worth it! =)
B000MD9UJC|5.0|I love my mini maglite and this little kit makes it so much brighter and the batteries last significantly longer. Great price for a great item.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|it is a good demo but at least give us more time and plus I don't know how to craft
1594744769|4.0|This is a YA novel, so I can't be too harsh about character development or dialog. The incorporation of pictures was a fun idea that I think was done well. If you are more on the &#34;adult&#34; side of the &#34;Young Adult&#34; spectrum it is unlikely that this will be your favorite book, but it is a very quick and easy read, so you likely won't hate it either.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|if you really like temple run two and if you like iron man you should download this game it is really fun and it is free
B001QWBM62|5.0|I got this to record practice with my band. I was sick of setting up my laptop with mics and using cumbersome programs. The H4N is just too damn easy. Plop it down in the middle of the room and hit record. Take it home and listen to the surprisingly studio quality recordings. It's sturdy and full of great features.

B001NHNG64|5.0|I could not stop reading!!!  Great plot with lots of twists and turns!  Highly recommend!  If you haven't started reading the Jack Reacher series, you really should!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|...this day has arrived and we can see what's next for Eva and Gideon.  There were scenes that made me nervous.  There were others that made me happy [Ireland], and/or sad [Tatiana], and/or frustrated [I have so had it with Corinne --she's relentless bad news, an albatross]. A couple scenes surprised the heck out of me [no comment -- it would spoil your surprise].  When Eva picks at her food, as she does a couple times in the book, that tells you about the level of emotional turbulence (she's usually a hearty eater.)  Be prepared for a whitewater rafting class iv rapids style ride for pretty much the whole book.  I would love to see a scene with Dr. Peterson in the next book.  Also: Monica has a secret, doesn't she.  And Cary. . .  Lots of plot strings to tie up.  San Diego, here we come!  If you happen to disagree with my rating, pls don't unhelpful me (the way Charlaine Harris's nasty review critics did) -- this is a valid opinion from someone who paid for her copy of the book and loved reading it.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I love reading from a man's POV. Hilarious! And from what I can tell, accurate! Loved it! If you haven't picked up this book yet, what are you waiting for?! Go and get it!
B002GSXKN8|4.0|I like all the movies especially Batman & Robin and Batman Forever. I also like having all 4 in one product.
B005LF9KMI|3.0|I watched this the other night with a completely open mind and the idea that I might not get a couple hours of my life back, but the story held my attention with some decent suspense and mystery.The plot is pretty dark and is revealed at decent intervals all the way up through the climax of the film.<br /><br />I'm not going to include any spoilers here, but there are a couple parts of this movie where the special effects are really cheesy (even for the time the film was made) which really ruin the mood of a couple scenes. Just pretend the effects are better than they really are and you'll be okay.<br /><br />I recommend this film if you're looking for a well paced supernatural/horror-suspense story. Don't expect too much out of the acting or special effects.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|so i was excited to get this and when i got it, it was in good condition and it worked well but when you extend it it still makes the noise and thats all i dont like about it but i love it overall
B0093H8HXS|4.0|The i3 3220 works great in my budget gaming rig. It's not perfect, as it is somewhat underpowered, but you can't go wrong at this price point. If you can afford an i5 get one of those instead. However, if you're building a budget rig you'll have no issues with this product.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was very touching and hit home. Hazel is such a strong woman in this book. Shes definitely an inspiration. John Green done such an amazing job!I'll definitely be reading more of his books. I think I'm going to buy Looking For Alaska right now!
B000066C1N|5.0|I really love this music by Bryan Adams!  He is to be applauded for the moving music in this soundtrack! It brings out so many emotions in me! During the movie if it weren't for the music, I don't think I'd be able to feel the emotions and feelings that the horse, Spirit is feeling and going thru and the indian boy! Every time I watch it or listen to the music, I feel it, I cry, I laugh, I am excited, it's almost as if I am in the movie itself!
B00BJ9VBLI|3.0|Great game until they ask u to pay to continue=(.<br />Right when u get into what it doing.. here's the catch for $$$$ u can go on=(
B007HUD6OS|5.0|I have been a Grisham fan for years and was excited to see he had started writing for kids. My nine year old daughter and I read the previous books in the series and were excited when this last installment (The Activist) appeared on my kindle. (Love that pre_<br />-order feature!)  This one was the best in the Kid Lawyer series. I love that Grisham has made learning about our legal system, activism and the internal struggle to do the right thing approachable for kids, entertaining and suspenseful.  As soon as we finished the book (about 10 days after release) she was appalled to learn that she would have to wait for him to write another.
B000VSYDRM|4.0|The actors chosen to be in this movie was a stunning success. Casting could not have been better. They made the movie worth watching. The story line was a bit slow but the lead made it real made it child like and I appreciate that. It is one I will watch again.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Great game for all,  all my grandkids love it..they loved the movie and this helps them remember the movie. We watch it over and over.
B00BEWCK8I|5.0|I'm just thrilled to have this great little record re-mastered. Most of the best songs on here were re-mastered for the greatest hits, but some personal favorites like \\"Sleepyhouse\\" and \\"Drive\\" were not included there. The addition of \\"Mother\\" and the other \\"Sippin' Time Sessions\\" was just icing on the cake. The slipcase cardboard packaging seems a little bland, but they did put in the lyrics to \\"Soul One\\" and \\"Mother\\" along with those of the original tracks, which I personally thought was very cool. I don't buy new music unless it's from bands I already follow, so to get re-masters from bands of the late 80's and 90's that I loved is always appreciated. The album sounds great! Now I'll just have to wait for the \\"Soup\\" re-master. Good job Blind Melon!
1402722001|5.0|I got this book on sale at Barnes & Noble, and I consider this book (not one story in this edition, but the whole edition itself) to be one of my top five favorites. It contains all 11 adventures and all 11 memoirs, starting with A Case of Identity and ending with The Final Problem, and the novel A Scandal in Bohemia. The stories themselves are about 563 pages long, and it was printed in China, but don't let that detur you, it is an excellent edition. The cover you see in the image is of that on the dustjacket and (to me) a very well done and extraordinary image of Holmes standing on a cobblestone walk next to a stone rail with lampposts on it and fall-naked trees on the opposite side of Sherlock, and fog it the background. The stories are magnificently written and keep you glued to them with their amazing plots. My personal favorite is The Man with the Twisted Lip, in which Holmes and Watson must find a man who has gone missing. I would highly recommend this book to and Sherlock Holmes fan, Suspense-Thriller fan or mystery fan. I say, my dear Watson, that it is quite elementary for you to buy this particular edition, for you shall not be disappointed in the least!
B007FC3AAI|5.0|My wife wanted this so she could bore me to death with even more of the twitard saga. It worked. I would rather gouge my eye balls out with a rusty fork than watch this crap.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|SOO Disappointed! That's all I have to say. Just looking for another way to get money out of a \\"sure thing\\" audience = STUPID!!! I just wish I could return it to get my money back! Goodbye Crossfire series. There are WAYYY more where you came from!
B00CL151G4|5.0|To anyone out there that is a Sherlock Holmes fan, you can't go wrong with this show. Johnny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu do an amazing job at portraying a new modern twist to such enjoyable characters.  Hands down, one of the best shows on TV.  Again, a must see.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love to go play bingo at bingo halls, but this is even better I can play it in my home! And there are blackout bingos too!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|If you want the full set, this is cheaper than purchasing individual (used) copies. They are in one case that is about the size of two normal dvd cases. Also, because they are all in one case, it is so much easier to get one out and put the next in.
B00594XOZU|1.0|this app didnt appear on my kindle and i havent used it so i say aweful!!!<br />its really aweful!!! thanks
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Yes I love the trilogy...but lets call it what it now is A Series because apparently the money is to good to let it end like it was suppose to! I am pissed by this deception!
B005C0DHEY|1.0|The problem is people are gullble.  If they say it's so it must be true.  The problem with this movie is its erroneous claims.  I'll just start with the water contamination...all the most valid studies say the same thing...it does NOT adversely affect the water supply.<br />You can make any study say anything if you skew the data.  The problem is most people don't know how to accurately read studies to see if the information is valid...so instead we rely on someone else to interpret that data.<br />Fracknation has more valid research data and it is interpreted more accurately.<br /><br />Great science fiction...probably funded by the same idiots that are trying to convince you about global warming....(again, look at the VALID studies...it just doesn't exist)
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This is a great sequel to the first book(beautiful creatures). Just make sure you read the first book and not come into this from the movie! If u do it will confuse you because you need information from the first book!
B00B47NO2O|1.0|So far every episode I've purchased of The Following from amazon has been very disappointing. The show is great if you don't mind sitting and watching a yellow circular motion on your screen while the video loads. Not very instant.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved this amazing book. It was touching and sad, but it was a great and heartwarming story to read! :)
B00846REIS|5.0|seriously wounded mentally and emotionally? If you stop and think about it for even a little while, we all have dreams of not having to worry about paying mortgages and bills, wanting a job we love and someone to love us. All of us.<br />If you take a look at our obsessions with youth, beauty, body type, material wealth, fashion style and sex you find a culture fascinated with the exterior polish and glamour of it all.<br />Take a casual glance at the number of books currently on Amazon that have Billionaire in the title, along with either pleasuring, submitting to or any approximation close to those words. Now are you getting the picture?<br /> I think it was Oprah, if not please forgive me, that you never know what horrors happen behind closed doors. Rather then take a viewpoint that no one in the book was unpleasant to look at, I see it as an exposure that all of the characters were horribly disfigured on the inside! What a psychological case study and thesis that would be!!!!<br />I truly believe that in-between the very hot sex that Ms. Day has very cleverly slipped in a lot for us to learn about our culture, our obsessions and our selves.<br />I have read a couple of her other books and there were some lessons to be found there as well. Much better written then Fifty Shades of Grey but I have a feeling that Anastasia, Christian, Eva and Gideon have and will teach us much more then any could imagine. I am hoping that Ms. Day does not disappoint in the sequels.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I didn't believe the ending. I actually went to a bookstore to check a paper choppy. I thought my Kindle missed part of it. I was so disappointed. I didn't need a happily ever after, but I did expect better for a series I spent so much time on.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I just finished the book and my thoughts are so scattered that my brain feels like its been run in the garbage disposal. But I wanted to write this as a stream of consciousness and not lose the feelings that are welling up inside me. How do you deal with a sexually abused child much less one who no one believed? That psychological scarring  would render most people completely incapable of functioning in any part of a &#34;normal&#34; way. To do that to a helpless, innocent child makes me sick to my stomach and heart and it also makes me angry. Are we really doing enough to protect our children from predators? I am not talking about just sexual predators, but physically, emotionally, psychologically and even those who carry guns into an elementary school? The justice system is not the answer, though don't get me wrong, they have to be there for the punishment aspect, but but then the godawful crime has already happened and isn't that a bit like closing the barn door after the cows have already gone?<br />About halfway through the book, I became concerned that Eva and Gideon's story was not moving fast enough to suit me but then it hit me. With all of the psychological undertones and only hints from Gideon thru his nightmares about his own childhood trauma, I should have been surprised that their romance moved as far forward as quickly as it did. Some readers may chide the author for seemingly making Eva appear weak and needy but I think she is one of the strongest female characters I have ever read. I can also understand Monica and her overriding obsession to keep Eva safe, yes it's from guilt, but in this case I think the quilt is colored in a mother's true horror over seeing her child hurt. I can totally see Monica's viewpoint, another strong female character to know herself so well that love alone would not be enough to make her happy.<br />Then we face a murder and right from the moment it happened, I knew who had done it. After all, did Gideon not tell Eva he would risk losing everything he owned and everything he was but he would not risk losing her? Is murder ever morally right? Lets put aside the legals aspects of that for a moment. Is taking another life ever right? To protect your home and loved ones? Revenge? As a precautionary measure? As punishment? Certainly in my own heart I have to judge that there are people in this world that are so evil that no society could be safe from them and tho I could, I don't want to take up space here by naming them. But then, what about the legal aspects of murder, we have set up laws that judge murderers as criminals, but we have tried so hard to employ checks and balances to protect the innocent that sometimes those murderers go free. And exactly who are the innocent we are protecting? Isn't the murder victim an innocent? No, of course not, not always. If Gideon was not a wealthy man would the police have agreed to drop the investigation as soon as they did? And what does that say about our society?<br />I read the book in a matter of hours, but I must admit, I have not gotten a lot of sleep. I am dying to pick up the third book right now and start reading it but I know if I do then I am not going to get much sleep tonight either....

B008UCJ7KO|3.0|The issues with Nathan's death are hanging over Eva and Gideon's head in this book.  However, if you're looking for this series to end, it's not. The author seems to be headed for part six and seven if this keeps up. Feels like a mini series at this point. I know...I know, that's a tad bit much, but it needs to end. There really wasn't a good reason for it not to.<br /><br />Eva is all over the place. She can't seem to get out of her own way when it comes to Brett. He wants her and she knows it; however, she doesn't let that mess of a relationship go. She wants to remain friends.<br /><br />Cary is all over the place as well. He like Eva needs to grow up. You're routing for Gideon in this book because he's really one of the only likable people.<br /><br />Gideon and Eva confess their love for one another, and they do this often. They also state they're obsessed with each other and it shows just as it did with the other books, especially with the love scenes.<br /><br />Gideon is constantly trying to make Eva feel at ease with her insecurities.  Her actions are juvenile at times.  It's like she doesn't appreciate him. She deliberately makes him jealous at times. That's so high school.  Eva is sweet enough but the confused girl bit needs to end. I understand insecurities related to being abused, but hers are a bit much at times.  At one point she says, &#34;Gideon was the man I wanted. We were just out of sync with our timing-I thought there was no reason to rush, he thought there was no reason to wait.&#34; Huh??? Let's read off the list of his positive qualities:<br /><br />The man is fine.<br />He's rich.<br />He's in love with her and tells her repeatedly.<br />He will stop at nothing to protect her.<br />Did I mention fine....IJS!<br />Every time she thinks she catches him in a lie in regards to another woman he's proven to be true to her. He's not perfect, but he protects her, loves her, and does whatever she needs to feel comfortable.  What more do you need Eva?<br /><br />On a good note. The sex scenes are on par for her books and steamy. The book is well written. Gideon is still all alpha male and dark. His love for Eva brings out his softer side, but that's what love does to the hardest of men.  I loved everything about Gideon. The author also does a good job of dealing with their past abuse.<br /><br />I just didn't see the need for part four. In the end it's probably about book sales, which is disappointing.<br /><br />Do us a solid Ms/Mrs. Day give this book a solid conclusion and ending in the next one...and END it please. Yes, I just yelled in a review. LOL!
B00C1CO0XS|5.0|George Benson has been at it for only 5 decades - you'd think after all this time, he might run out of steam. The incredible thing about his new tribute album to Nat King Cole is that just the opposite has happened. The singing and guitar work is just as strong as the heyday of his career. I'm just baffled that he hasn't fallen off after all these years. Throw in some great cameos by Wynton Marsalis, Idina Menzel and Michael McDonald (+ more) and you have a classic album in the making.<br /><br />Whether or not you're familiar with Nat's repertoire (I mean, who isn't at this point?) this album is enjoyable from start to finish and makes a great addition to any record collection. Highly recommended!
1400069807|4.0|\\"That's as American as apple pie\\" was once floated as the country's quintessential saying, now we are more apt to hear \\"I can't believe it's not butter\\". Our diet has changed, and not for the better. We've traded wholesome fresh meals for convenience, and our idea of good food is tied to what is easy and full of \\"flavor\\". We now equate mom's cooking with readymade processed chemicals sold to us as \\"oven ready\\" or \\"easy bake\\" goods. How and why did this happen?<br />Pulitzer Prize author Michael Moss tackles our complicated relationship with food and food manufactures in his book Salt, Sugar, Fat. His is an inside look into the competitive world of food manufacturing and how the billion dollar industry moved Americans away from real food to salt, sugar & fat laden chemicals and in the process convinced us it was healthy and nutritious, \\"just like mom used to make\\". Yeah, if mom was a high school chemist cooking crack.<br />Other reviewers have gone over the many aspects of the book so I will cut to the chase. You should read the book to learn:<br />Which food giants will not touch their own products?<br />How discarded milk byproducts became American cheese, which in turn became an essential ingredient in almost all of our food.<br />Why Americans have food issues and feel powerless over them.<br />How corporate America is dictating what you eat, without you realizing it.<br />You should read it if you really want to learn what it is you really eat.

B006LSZECO|4.0|I'm not a big fan of first person writing, but after a couple pages, definitely got into it. The author did a good job at putting you in both the characters shoes. Kept me hooked until the very end!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl was enjoyable and intriguing, made me want to stay up until the early hours of the morning in order to finish it, and had characters who became more and more complex as the story went on.<br /><br />Amy and Nick Dunne have been married for five years when Amy goes missing on their anniversary.  This book shows their life together starting from when they first met.  Each chapter covers the feelings from one person, either Amy or Nick, and follows how they grow and learn about each other.  About how Amy grew up privileged in New York and doted upon because she was an only child and the focus of the Amazing Amy stories her parents wrote.  How Nick grew up in a dysfunctional family with his twin sister Go (short for Margo.)<br /><br />Then comes the kicker.  The recession hits, both Nick and Amy lose their jobs, Amy's trust fund, and Nick finds out his mother has cancer.  So, they move from New York to Missouri where Nick is from to help his sister with their mother and their father who is living in a nursing home.<br /><br />The whole premise of the story is based around when and why Amy went missing.  What happened and how did they get away with it?  Nick is implicated throughout the whole story (as well as other characters).  But there are more twist and turns that even you won't know what to believe until the very end and you might still be confused on  some parts.<br /><br />All in all.  This is a must read.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I truly looked forward to reading this at night.  Quite a story about a young woman coming to terms with her troubled past. Incredible at times,  but believable, and very well written.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I have read and savored every novel in this series. Reading this installment was painful - and knowing this was the finale was appalling. Forget plot, forget creativity, and forget any type of intelligent resolution.<br />I haven't seen a disastrous ending like this Bobby Ewing stepped out of the shower.

B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Khaled Housseini certainly has a way with words! For over a decade, I and so many other Americans have been wrapped up in Afghanistan, but in such a limited way. We have heard almost daily reports of deaths of Americans and Afghanis, tales of horrible accidents, just all the awful news one hears from a war zone.  Mr. Housseini writes in such depth about Afghanistan and its geographical neighbors that now that I've finished not just \\"Kite Runner\\" but also \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\", I feel I know so much more about the country's history.  \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" includes a brief reference to the 9/11 attack on the USA.  It ends in Kabul, at a time when things are beginning to be better for the people there. This book is bleak in some ways, but I was prepared, after reading \\"Kite Runner\\", for surprises along the way, and there are plenty.  There are few characters created by the author that aren't sympathetic ones because of flaws of birth or circumstances of their lives.  They are described in depth over the pages.  I read this book on my Kindle, often filled with dread and worry about the characters as the story unfolded.  Sometimes I was afraid to click to the next page.  Mr. Housseini brings the reader up to a chasm of horror, she looks down into a black hole of sadness and then she turns the page, receiving a respite as she absorbs this latest tragedy and contemplates what possibly could rescue those of whom the reader has grown so fond.  A while later, when the heart calms down a bit, he continues to tell the story.  When I finished the book, I had so much relief that some of the characters survived, and that loose ends were wrapped up enough to bring me peace.  I probably don't have to mention that I am about to order the next novel written by Khaled Housseini.  If he has not received awards for his writing, something is amiss.  I highly recommend his books, both for the historical content which was completely new to me, and for the richness of his characters, all of them.

193700788X|3.0|I loved the beginning of this series but have not cared for the the last two books.  BUT I felt the need to finish the series even if I wasn't enthusiastic. I think the author felt the same way.  Unlike some of the other readers, I was not disappointed by who she ended up with because she has made it clear from the beginning she did not want to be a vampire so what future did she really have with Eric anyway? What I was disappointed with was the overall sloppiness in which Harris wrote this book. Sookie is a one-dimensional version of herself. She doesn't question things she would have questioned in every other book. Other characters are the same way. It is like Harris wanted to write a book that neatly resolved all the issues/characters even if it contradicted who the characters are at their core. I actually wonder if a ghost writer was used because the book lacked Harris' humor and love of her characters.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|What a great album! It's been a long time (6 years!) since we've seen a new album from QOTSA and they really delivered a great album. It's a nice mix of avant garde songs (Kalopsia, If I had a Tail), stoner rock (Keep Your Eyes Peeled, Fairweather Friends, Smooth Sailing), slower songs (....Like Clockwork, The Vampyre of Time and Money) and some more radio friendly songs (I sat by the ocean, I appear missing).  Maybe a slightly slower feel overall than other albums, but it adds up to a great mix and there's very little not to like here. I think the weakest track is If I Had a Tail, but it's still a decent track. This is QOTSA at their best.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|I am a huge Jeffrey Archer fan. I have enjoyed this entire series and look forward to the next one. Keep it up.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|So I've been reading the reviews and have to agree that I am quite disappointed that this book has been drawn out into an additional two books? First we had to wait months after the second book just because she signed with a publishing house, now we have to wait probably even longer just to get the ending.<br /><br />Concerning the plot, I still love Sylvia wrote Gideon's character in this book because that was what made me fall in love with this series. However, I do not like how flimsy she has been writing Ava, Ava's mother and Carey. I felt like the drama that they created in this book was just filler material so that Sylvia can extend the story an extra two books.<br /><br />In the end, this book could have had the conclusion that everyone enjoys. Rather it only holds a setup for the next books. Not worth your $10.
B003VANOFY|2.0|i bought these as my first set of wireless headphones.<br /><br />I normally trust logitech to deliver quality products, but they seem to be slipping lately.  My last set of heaphones was wired, and logitech.  I had two sets of them and they both broke quickly at the headband.  After doing some research it looks like logitech farmed out the production and allowed their name to be slapped on an inferior product (which they have now discontinued).  I decided to give them another try.<br /><br />The power likes to switch it off when it is plugged in and should not be going into power saving mode.  I understand this functionality when someone is using batteries, not when it is plugged in.  This wouldn't be a big problem if they weren't so finicky about being turned back on.  The instructions say to hold the button for 3 seconds to power them after they have been turned off.  When you do this the first time it has no effect after waiting for probably 30 sconds.  When you do it the second time and wait for about 10 seconds they will power on.  There are complaints on forums about this, so it isnt just my set.<br /><br />The provided software does not allow the user to map the G-Keys to a keyboard stroke.  Logitech has recently provided a software update to their keyboard program that willl locate and allow you to use the headphones:  this new update will allow the user to map the G-Keys on the headphones the same way they can be mapped on the keyboards and mice, including keystrokes, macros, and scripts.<br /><br />The sound can be VERY distorted in surround mode, it depends what you are listening to, and the distortion does not go away with a lower volume setting (surround encoding problem).  There is a workaround for this on the logitech forums, but it involves disabling all of the advanced features on the headphones and using them in normal stereo mode.<br /><br />It looks like I will be moving away from logitech products in the future.
B0093FNZT6|3.0|I have read a number of books regarding people's experience of heaven.  I appreciated the purpose in writing this book from a neurosurgeon who had experienced an after life  experience, but while the initial part of the book was really gripping, it became a bit tedious and failed to really hold my attention.  Theologically I felt it was rather lightweight.  While the experience was clearly very real I was disappointed that there was no real God encounter.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|You should really buy this app because it is really good. So who cares how much it cost it's worth it
B005LAIHPE|5.0|My dad has wanted this movie for a while so I thought it would be a really nice gesture to get it for him. He was so happy when I handed it to him!
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Orson Scott Card did a great job with this book.  This is one of the most thoughtful and philosophical books I have read in a long time.  The whole book and storyline are just incredibly clever, but not in a showoffy kind of way.  I can't wait to read the next book in the Ender series.
B008N1V11U|5.0|This game is awesome, I never expected this kind of game for a tablet. The storyline is good and graphics are superb.
B005NFWCSK|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  I watched it the weekend after I saw Iron Man 3 and Star Trek and I felt this was the best of the three movies.  I was surprised at how top notch the cast was.  Michael Fassbender has been one of my favorite actors after seeing him in Inglorious Basterds and Prometheus.  I also really liked the 60s style to the whole movie and found some of the outfits ridiculously stylish given the situation.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|It is a lot like Mario bros. You will be hooked once you start playing it. Great game and graphics.
0061186473|3.0|As with a lot of short stories, there are usually ones you like and ones you don't. That is the case for me in this book. A couple of my favorites are when a detective is sent to investigate Humpty Dumpty's fall, or when and elderly lady finds the holy grail, or a wonderful black cat that is better for the family than they'll ever know. Some of the others were just okay. I guess the biggest disappointment was that they have the story of the Graveyard Book in there (condensed form). I had already read this book and to have this wasted space in there was a bit irritating. Nonetheless is was a pretty good read.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|Great song with the experience of Tom Kiefer. I think who's the fan of Cinderella will not disapoint. Thank you
B000JMKQX0|1.0|The book is just a collection of short episodes and tries to tack onto the recent zombie craze. There is zero character play or suspense in it. It seems the author wants us to go &#34;oooh zombies&#34; and swallow it. It just ends up being boring because it's the same old scenario without any characters, so no reason to keep reading.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|A great puzzle game. Keeps you on your toes and looking for the next clue. Definitely liking forward to other similar games!
1932100660|5.0|One heck of an eye opener.  I had a hard time putting this book down & ended up thinking about it for MONTHS afterwards.  Amazing information on how your diet can really screw things up.  I HIGHLY recommend this book, it will make you think differently, at least for a while !
B001NHNG64|4.0|The Jack Reacher series is a great one.  The character development is outstanding.  Reacher is the type of guy we all fantasize to be.  He operates without our limitations, but does the right thing.  The early books always have the romance interest.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This book shows just how far true love can go no matter how far that they half to go to find it.
B0092C2X7U|3.0|This game is sort of like all the other games when you jump off ropes or do back flips. You learn how to do the game until you run out of levels to play. I got the game and I'm having a hard time learning how to use the controls. The man who does back flips is creepy and bleeds every time he fails the jump. I'm not sure if I should keep this game or not.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|So good for my kids. An educational game that is realistically geared for a tech generation. Five stars no question.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|For the people that are angry that Miami doesn't upload it just came out today on kindle fire and it does have New York and Sydney and everything else. The game is free and it is so addicting even though you do the same thing over again it is still really fun to play with. it is not hard at all and if you have it on kindle and it keeps deleting your high score then you need the the newest version of the kindle fire and if you do oh well  but I love  this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003QSMC18|5.0|I don't like to overanalyze my Disney movies (all of the time) and so I liked this one. The music was good too. Sadly, I was more scared by the Shadow Man than I care to admit!
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Delivering on a promise 11 books in the making with moments that absolutely had me squeeing outloud! Yes, I have loved Ms. Singh's work since I discovered it, but for me--this book is literally the culmination of that love. I cannot get over the enormous amount of payoffs, provocative storytelling and a setting so brilliantly hard and lush in the same breath. I will not post anything more because it would lead to spoilers, but hands down--this is my favorite book to date and she did what I as an author would have thought impossible.
B004EIZCPM|5.0|I was expecting something a little more cheesy actually, but this was nicely done and hilarious. Love Emma Stone and her dry humor.
0425263924|1.0|Is Day on crack!? This after waiting forever I end up reading crap. The first two books were amazing. Do not spend your money on the third book! Fifty Shades of Grey may have been poorly written, but at least James could wrap up the book. This book left you hanging. I was so confused reading this. Don't waste your time. You're not missing out
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Amazing final book. Such a long journey to the last battle. This was  the best ending to a series since the Return of the King!! Rest in peace  Robert  Jordan.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The puzzles were hard and a good challenge for your mind. You are always curious about what will happen 10 stars if I could.
B003LQ3YXU|1.0|I made it throughout the first 12 episodes fine, but the 13th just won't start. Pc restart, browser, everything I can think of and it just buffers with those blue dots. My net speed and comp specs are great.
1781162646|1.0|Why oh why did King elect to make this a physical book only and shun eBooks? Does he really think it will help &#34;mom and pop&#34; book stores? No, it helps paper producers and harms the environment. Even though I am a huge fan of his work, I'll not buy until I can get it on my Kindle. Sorry.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|This is as close as it gets to candy crush saga on kindle.. sense there isn't an app for that yet... pffft.. anyways.. it's really fun and addicting!!! :) def worth the download!!
0307949486|3.0|I can't decide between a three and four star rating.  The story is worth four stars, but the writing definitely harms the presentation.<br /><br />It took me several passes to actually get through the novel.  The beginning is extremely slow and bogged down in details, and it wasn't until I had watched the movie that I decided that the reward was worth the slog through the beginning of the novel.<br /><br />There's a good story here and some interesting context, but the pacing is completely off and the writing is exceptionally dull.  I'm not sure if this is a problem with the translation or if it's something inherent in Swedish writing, but it made for a difficult read.<br /><br />To put it another way, I'm really interested to find out what happens to the main characters in the next book, but it's been over a year and I still can't bring myself to start.  That's how painful it is to read this book, great story be damned.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I was so glad when I saw you had this for my kindle. Works without problems. I am very pleased. Thank you
0345525558|5.0|A terrific story of love and forgiveness through the language (meanings) of flowers.  A wonderful story through and through. The flower meanings may surprise you.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|We watched the 3D version using our PS3 and the movie was very entertaining.  The 3D was not over the top.  Can't wait for the next chapter...
B002VECM6S|5.0|I love love loooooooooove this movie!!! Sandra is a super actress  and the movie its just amazing and more thinkin that its a really story you will love it.
B005D4YOJ6|5.0|The Keen Newport Sandal is my third pair of Keen shoes as with the others they are well constructed, fit very well and aesthetically designed. My two different styles of Keen trail shoes appear to be lasting forever. I highly recommend the Keen brand and will purchase more of them in the future.
B0067R0APK|4.0|I am able to make wiser decisions with app that are rainfall sensitive,<br />I just updated and like the changes.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I'm so glad Brandon Sanderson was the author who took up finishing the series. This was another well written installment by Sanderson. The story was captivating and all ends felt satisfactorily wrapped up. I wish the series hadn't been so long (maybe just 5 or 6 books?), but these last few books were excellent.
630522577X|5.0|What can one say about this movie with such excellent stars and scenery (although all shot in studio) it looked quite authentic.<br />We thoroughly enjoyed the movie even though we have seen it before many times.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This saga was wonderful. From the first chapter I was sucked in and couldn't stop thinking about the characters. The story moved at a good pace for my tastes and the characters were well written. I plan on reading the sequel saga, even though this book stands pretty well on its own.
B004IK8Q86|5.0|The characters in this novel, while having different goals in life in their youth, find out that life changes and how you perceive them determine whether you'll find happiness.  Isabel found the life she wished for, shallow consumerism and preceded to raise daughters to follow in her narrow path. Sophia had what she wanted and a drunk took it away leaving her to lose her life as well.  Poor Eliott, chasing the approval of the rich who disdain him, appearing to be the shallowest of all and yet showing character when it mattered the most. He saw Larry for who he was and who he wanted him to be. No wonder Larry loved him. And Larry?  The most courageous of all.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I loved the questions it posed about getting old, serving in an intergalactic military, and what makes us human. I plan on reading the rest of the series. I can see why this book and Scalzi's other novels have won several awards. I read the ebook and listened to it on audiobook. The narrator did a good job with the characters and I had no trouble telling them apart. I did have a continuous nagging feeling that I had read the story somewhere before. The Starship Troopers novel may be where I'm getting some flashbacks.
B00CXN2JNS|5.0|Let me start off saying I have every Megadeth release from day one. I am a long time fan. Dave Mustaine at times has shown different sides of his writing styles on every release. All bands seem to have an expected sound. I personally like it when they step outside their expected box every once in awhile. Artists can't create the same piece of art over and over. The negative reviews seem to be wanting Dave and crew to sound like they did 20 years ago. Megadeth has always written what they wanted to create. Some of their discs have been thrash, some metal, and some had radio friendly hard rock tunes. Dave is an artist. Super Collider is not thrash, but it is heavy, and it does ROCK! The title track is the most radio friendly, but I still like it. The Thin Lizzy cover Cold Sweat kicks ass! All the other tracks are rocking. I personally think this is one of Megadeth's best releases. The samples don't do justice to the tunes! Try it, I believe you will like it. Don't expect Peace... Sells, we see the other side of Dave on this one. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B00012QM8G|5.0|My grandparents lived in Poland when this was all happening... they helped smuggle Jews out on the underground railroad, so naturally this film 'hit home' a bit. I LOVE this movie! And cry through pretty much the whole thing. If you have not seen it, I highly recommend it! Great sense of history, very moving, heartbreaking, shocking, you name it!
B00004RF9I|5.0|I first watched this when I was a teenager in the late 80s on TV and found it depressing. My favorite movie back then was Empire Strikes Back. I still enjoy other \\"great\\" movies (Hitchcock, Kubrick, Welles, etc), but this one is more than a movie : it concisely bridges the art of filmic storytelling and human truth. That was my reaction after I saw Network two years ago, when the whole world to me started to look like a big farce. It said the things in my head more eloquently than I could ever have put forth. It warms my heart that many now consider it to be the Greatest movie ever made.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Great movie! Very moving, had me on the edge of my seat the whole time, and made me want to adopt ever child on the planet. However, I will not be watching it again. It is based on a true story (and it is an incredible story) which made it a little too much (emotionally) for me to process. I highly recommend watching it at least once!
B0083ZRAJS|3.0|I like th e geography of Oz, but I enjoy the play and movie better. Still, a timeless classic for sure.
0670026603|5.0|This story had me from the beginning.  The description of the characters made them so real.  I felt like I was there and totally involved in their lives. Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down.  I'm an avid reader and have read lots of different types of books, but nothing like this one.  Kudos to the author JoJo Moyes.
1442337966|5.0|If you live your life by the Secret all will be well. Instead of listening to music listen to this over and over again. It will change your life.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book.  It was hilarious.  Also, a nice change up being that it was from Drew's POV.  I just could not put it down.  Can't wait for book 2
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|I'm probably way off base but to me this movie was about how dysfunctional all of us are underneath the facade we put up for others to see. How we tell \\"White Lies\\" to others and to ourselves and how infrequently we really say what is on our mind - really.<br />Despite a rather unusual plot the actors did a spot on job portraying their characters - well done everyone.<br />All in all it was not something I would watch again but I did enjoy watching the actors and tried to get into the story but found myself having trouble accepting the idea we are all as screwed up as the main characters.<br />Not a movie for the family to sit down and watch, I would strongly advise caution with children and young teens (13 and under).
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|What u could do is add mutiplayer and co-op in the game it would be so cool of u guys
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This movie really surprised me, I was totally awed by its spectacular and beautiful vistas. I really enjoyed this and its original plot makes for a pleasurable experience. I recommend this movie but caution young children viewing it because there are some scenes that may be disturbing.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Great game. Very interesting &amp; addictive. Having an awesome time playing! If you love to fish, this will definitely keep you entertained.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|This movie was pretty predictable all the way through and the story was about what I expected. The acting was good and overall I enjoyed the movie.<br />Definitely NOT for children (language)
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Love it. More functional than originally thought. Love this app!<br />Does everything I need it to!<br />Looking forward to using this clock
B00AREIAI8|5.0|the app is a fine app, but I would have liked if you were able to get gems a bit easier. But I'm glad you can still get gems.
B00BOX0K0M|1.0|Beware.  This filter has very poor optical quality - it will make your videos blurry.  It's easy to see by holding this filter up and looking through it - images are hazy looking.  The polarizing film may be OK - but it's mounted on a cheap clear plastic that adds lots of distortion and blurriness.
B005XDHNF4|5.0|We got this for our son and his bride for their cake top as they collect mini lego figurines. Everyone absolutley loved it. It comes with 3 different hair colors for the bride which was great as we needed the brown. It comes with different flowers but we took the white and painted them to match their flowers. I would highly recommend this to any Lego collector.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|TWO STARS...and I'm being generous. I've been a fan of this series since the beginning, and love Gideon and Eva. But I was also prepared, even excited, for the final HEA with this book. No such luck, and ultimately it just leaves me pissed off. Milking it much? Two MORE books to close out an increasingly thin plot? I find myself resenting the crazy assed cliff hangers and characters when really it was time to tie this one up with a bow.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Deep characters in a well developed world. The story is believable and engaging and leaves the reader eager to experience the next book.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|A super addicting free game.  I can't put down my tablet.  Make sure to buy upgrades if you can't get past a level.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I read it and I loved it. I still can't believe how gary became the d.j. of the dance. Wow
B00BKU9ZFU|5.0|Extraordinary 2nd solo cd by a shooting star, Madame Cecile Mclorin Salvant. If you only buy a few jazz cd's this year please make this one of them and support a wonderful new jazz artist with the soul of the classic ones we all love and something fresh that we all look for. The ending of \\"What A Little Moonlight Can Do\\" is just mind boggling !
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|Thought-provoking and fun movie. There is more than meet the eye. Excellent for all the family, kids, teenagers as well as adults.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|This book has gotten a lot of buzz. It started out so strong that I was shocked at about the 1/2 to 2/3 mark when it suddenly fell flat.<br />It also made me wonder what all the buzz had been about.<br /><br />The information about the language of flowers worked so well with the main character's dilemmas in the beginning. Then there came a point at which I began to tire of her lack of change. I believe it was at that moment that the character should have changed and the book should have headed toward its conclusion.<br /><br />Diffenbaugh notes some writing friends, in her acknowledgements, who helped her through several rewrites of the ending. Unfortunately, she still didn't get it right.
B008FVZHKO|5.0|This is a great album and was at a great price, it was delivered as promised with no issues and in good shape.
B00BC24NT4|4.0|I've read everything he ever wrote, and remain a die-hard fan.  He's honest and a brave observer, but he has, in the last couple of books turned his ire on the multi-nationals who have extended their reach all over the world.  The fact that some of these companies are American has earned him a spate of negative reviews that, in my opinion, are undeserved.  For me, he's still one of the best there is in the realm he chooses to write.
B005LAIIJY|1.0|I will say this: Tarantino DOES know how to provoke an audience: Jaime Foxx is someone I've long admired from his \\"Living Color\\" days thru his exceptional portrayal of Ray Charles.  Tarantino could do a movie about the Twelve Disciples, and by the end, you'd be wanting to take a shot at all of them.  And Christopher Waltz?  I have NEVER - not even viewing movies about Hitler or Manson - wanted to see a character just DIE, slowly & painfully - which, I guess, was Tarantino's intention.  Same with the character Leonardo DiCaprio portrayed.  And maybe getting Samuel Jackson to do the \\"yassuh-nosuh\\"-home slave was a total insult - or a testament to Jackson's worth as an supreme actor.  But for those \\"yankees\\" of you reading this, dig: I am a PROUDLY  SOUTHERN BOY - and while we Southerners might have \\"had slaves\\" (MY family certainly didn't - they came over with Oglethorpe) they were NOT beat mercilessly or used as sexual relief.  Think about it, libbos - if a person paid money for another man's services, they certainly WEREN'T going to spend time beating on them.  Remember the character, \\"Mammy\\" in \\"Gone With The Wind?\\" (I can hear you chanting \\"I am woman hear me roar...\\") THAT Lady ran the household while Miz Skalett was busy running around collecting & disposing husbands.  \\"Antidote to Gone With The Wind?\\" Nope - a liberal guilt rehash.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|It seemed to work amazingly for a while.... then it wouldn't let me even enter the app..... save the space... DONT DOWNLOAD IT!!!!!!!!!
B00BSBUZPK|2.0|Dearest-On-Earth is an Eagles fan (as am I - sort of...well, up thru &#34;The Long Run,&#34; anyway...) and she recently paid pretty close to a house payment on a ticket to see the Eagles. &#34;Aw, Honey,&#34; she asked, &#34;Don't you wanna go?&#34;  Be real....that much money to see a band in whom I have but a tepid interest...and in seats that require a pair of binoculars?????  No thanks, and her interest in the Eagles, and my refusal to pay, basically, usury, prompted my purchase of &#34;History Of...&#34;  And although the DVD is interesting all the way thru, you know that you don't need me to tell you ANY aspect of the Eagles' story.  That said, there are three parts to &#34;History,&#34; the first two DVDs being...well, &#34;history.&#34;  The third is a performance by the band in their &#34;Hotel California&#34; days, yes, stll with Randy Meisner.  All in all, though, &#34;History&#34; just proves three things: 1) Don Henley and - especially! - Glen Frey are and forever will be total, unmitigated jerks; 2) Acquiring Don Felder was - world without end, amen, amen - the absolute very BEST THING the band EVER did; indeed, the movie tries not to display this fact, but Felder was 100% responible for the group's greatest song, the aforementioned &#34;Hotel California&#34;; and 3) Despite the presence of Steuart Smith, Felder's part-time replacement (and indeed, the cat IS hot as a jumper cable at a redneck funeral - I have a boot of a Cinemax concert he did in 1988, and as much as I love Wynonna, and as shocked and pleasantly impressed as I was by k.d. lang's talent - Smith was RIGHT THERE, 100% of the time) - OK, let me start again: despite Steuart Smith's considerable talent, the Eagles are now, like the touring Rolling Stones and Procol Harum, but mere &#34;tribute acts.&#34;  Still: the story is told well, and DVD #3 beats spending the month's grocery money on a &#34;ticket.&#34;<br />Subsequent comment after looking at this this several times: if there is ANY justice in this world, someone, preferably another musician, will hold G Frey's head under water till he turns the color of a ripe grape.  There is absolutely NO EXCUSE for he and pedo-Henley (yeah...they didn't talk about THAT either, did they?) for the 2 creating (sic) &#34;Eagles Music,&#34; then birddogging all the royalties therefrom, because (sic) &#34;he & Henley were the only 2 that had anything on the 'chart' during the vile eighties.&#34;  'scuse me a second there, dudesicle - you think Joe Walsh was &#34;idle?&#34;  Ringo had him till the iggles reformed.  Tim Schmitt himself on this...thing...describes how busy HE was doing session work.  And how about Don Felder, the genius you bullied out of the group?  Didja hear the soundtrack to a movie, &#34;Heavy Metal?&#34;  Frey is like any good liberal: he uses the &#34;truth&#34; only when it serves his purposes.  YEAH, I'M BILL BOARD AND I SAID IT!  Glen Frey was a jerk and &#34;History&#34;proves it.ice in this world, someone, preferably another musician, will hold G Frey's head under water till he turns the color of a ripe grape.

Please read this book if to want to understand how we have come so far. Read it and beleive we can go further
0425263924|1.0|What a disappointment!  I have waited for months for the last book in the series and what a surprise we are now told she will be adding 2 more books.  I feel we have been screwed over in an attempt to sell more books.  I think this truly reflects on the credibility of Ms. Day.  The story line was wearing really thin and she thinks she can eek 2 more books out? Well, lots of luck, I will spend my dollars on other authors that when they say it's a trilogy it will remain a trilogy.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This was a page turner.  It was our book club choice and we had the most spirited discussion about it.  It sparked enough interest that one of the members researched and sent us more information on some of the details described in the book.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|Great job on this, love the prequel style and how well the actors not only paid homage, but made the new series their own.
B0090KZDSK|3.0|I was really looking forward to reading entwined with you, counting down the days. I'm honestly a little let down. Talk about a story that didn't really go anywhere. I kept waiting for something to happen, but it didn't really. Lots of little things that didn't lead anywhere. I hope the next book is better.

There's not a whole lot involved which is why it is good for small children with little attention spans. The only thing I wish there were more of is a wider variety of mini games.

B00C9U9YOW|5.0|I have been anticipating this album for awhile. I've been listening to the first single, \\"My God is the Sun,\\" and old QOTSA albums all week gearing up for this release. I was really pleased with Them Crooked Vultures, but I am delighted to get back to a fully focused QOTSA album.<br /><br />This album is pure QOTSA. If I were to compare it to past offerings, it is most reminiscent of of themes from Lullabies to Paralyze, and invokes a strong sense of Homme's roots in Kyuss. However, it is a departure from Era Vulgaris. Era Vulgaris came on like a heart attack, power thumped your brain for an hour with hard hitting rock and then tossed you aside. ...Like Clockwork is far more creative and playful. ...Like Clockwork is reaching for a deeper and more meaningful connection. This is much more complex effort, both musically and lyrically. If your a long time fan you should pick this up on the first listen, but if you came to QOTSA first by Era Vulgaris, this will not meet your expectations.<br /><br />...Like Clockwork isn't from this dimension. Homme is at home doing his own thing and ...Like Clockwork is a successfully avant garde offering. It contains the best experimental efforts of an art-rock album coupled with Homme's hard-rock genius and technical precision. The list of contributors to this offering is fantastic, but none overshadow or hijack the show. This is a new and original work, but it's a natural evolution of 90s rock that was weened on 70s hard rock. \\"Smooth Sailing\\" has Reznor's prints all over it and invokes the strength of Broken's best moments. \\"If I Had a Tail\\" is infused with Kyuss's Desert Session alchemy. The song \\"...Like Clockwork\\" caught me unawares at the end and conjured memories of This Mortal Coil. If your catching these musical allusions, you'll know how powerfully compelling the amalgamation is. I'm not in the \\"rock is dead\\" mindset that is so pervasive these days, but if rock is truly dying, then the best and most talented musicians are consolidating around QOTSA and are going out Alamo style.onsolidating around QOTSA and are going out Alamo style.
B00BEXB18M|5.0|Not as good as releases like TSHF or UA in my opinion but there is a lot of cool stuff on this album.  I love that Megadeth likes to change things up here and there.  For example \\"Don't Turn Your Back\\" is heavy yet it incorporates some awesome blues guitar.  Quality stuff.
B0062OCNAI|5.0|I really enjoyed this one.  Gave me a lot to think about, the way Mother and Daughter interacted.  Haunting in a way.  I willl read this one more than once.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Crazy from start to finish the author gives you and ending you won't believe you see it and hear it all from promises to break ups to make ups god I haven't put it down since I got it shipped to my kindle
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|***Just what I was hoping for***<br />This book is brilliant. It picks up right where Reflected left off on the highest point on the roller coaster and it doesn't stop there. Entwined will continue on this roller coaster thru the entire book. Eva and Gideon have to fight so hard to be together because of there pasts. It takes you up and down an around and back again. There are some new players on this book that are out for blood against them by it makes the book that much better. Keeps you on your feet and on your toes. In the beginning of the book they start again and have to work hard to keep it. They grow stronger as a couple an as friends they really are perfect for each other. There story continues and people from there past try and try to destroy them but in typical Gideon and Eva fashion they fight for love. By the end of the book Gideon gets exactly what he wants and I LOVE IT but yet again someone is trying to harm Eva with her past. I can't wait to see the next roller coaster adventure this series takes us on.For people to say they expected more that's there own opinion to me this book was a true Eva and Gideon story when as there love and passion ever been normal this book is just as intense as the other 2 if not more.  Oh yea and Cary messes up grrr he irritates me lol<br /><br />****Now I want to rant just a little bit****<br />I completely get people are turned off by the price. They also thought it was gonna be a trilogy. Well I guessed she changed her mind.<br />I'm glad personally because that was a whole lot of informational as it was for one book. It leaves me wanting more. There is no way that this book is a 1star review at all people are just upset an that is not fair to Sylvia Day and her brilliance as a author. She has drawn in millions of people with WORDS I look forward to many more of her books.<br />Thanks for listening :)
B003I55BIA|5.0|I have read this book over and over again and never get tired of it. It makes me want to have a love story of my own like this!!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I love each hidden object game from this company so far. The only thing I would change is to make it longer. Seems like I beat them in two short sittings. Otherwise, great game! The short time frame is the only thing keeping me from giving it five stars.

B003G4W49C|4.0|Enjoyed reading this very much. Couldn't put it down. Hope the movie does it justice. A well-written piece of fiction.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|QOTSA have done what very few bands do anymore and that is create a cohesive album that is not just a collections of tracks, I think of Pet Sounds in that it tells of personal feelings, moods, experiences, you could almost say it's a 21st century Pet Sounds for the demented but also very beautiful with pure raw emotions. You can tell a lot heart and thought was put into this record and not rushed to get a consumable product out.  I think of this album as a dream with a nightmare in there and a very much moody, to get the full experience you have to watch the videos with the great artwork and illustration to get a visual picture. I see the album as their masterwork, you get a combination of the stoner rock, slower ballads that explode and rock, trippy trance like music Kalypsio (sp) one of the coolest songs, straight ahead rock with swagger Smooth sailing...just an incredible album also do yourself a favor and watch the NPR show..incredible

B003JTHXOK|4.0|3.5 stars. My short, no-spoilers review:<br />I think this is a worthy read and an important novel, but I'm uncomfortable with it being pegged as a romance between two people with \\"a past.\\" Yes, there's a romance there, but the author covers a very important human rights topic. I do recommend this novel, but if you decide to read it or you watch(ed) the movie, I encourage you to look up more info on the topic (especially if you don't understand what could possibly make me uncomfortable about labeling this simply as a story of romance).<br /><br />****IF YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE PAST OF THE MAIN CHARACTER, KATIE, MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD.****<br /><br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br /><br />Again, minor spoilers (no spoilers of the ending):<br /><br />[Trigger warning: domestic violence/intimate partner violence]<br /><br />What this novel really does is present a woman who's escaped her husband, Kevin, who abuses her physically, emotionally, sexually, and economically. Katie moves to a new town and eventually finds romance there, but this isn't the main focus. She's not simply a woman with ~a past~ who falls in love, she is a survivor of intimate partner violence who understandably lives in fear that one day Kevin will find her. Because Kevin narrates part of the novel, we as the audience see he is, in fact, looking for her.<br /><br />Sparks shows that leaving an abusive relationship is a long process and that staying in the relationship can also be an important aspect of keeping yourself safe--this is what I really like about the novel--but I think he took the easy way out with his characterization of Kevin. He's an alcoholic and even seems deranged, but the reality of course is that not all alcoholics abuse their partners, and not all people who abuse their partners are alcoholics. Also, his career/resources make him even more of a threat when he's looking for her (if you've seen the movie trailer or the movie itself, you probably know what I mean), but anotherreality is that people from all walks of life are capable of being threatening in this sense, especially when GPS technology and social networking make it easy to find one another.<br /><br />Again, I recommend this novel, but I think it deserves more respect than being labeled as a love story only. You can find more info on the Centers for Disease Control website by searching for intimate partner violence. Thanks for reading.
1455526959|5.0|At this point, is there anything left to be said in regards to Michael Connelly's writing? His plots are varied, with some of them consisting of \\"mysteries\\" and others being more procedurals, with less emphasis on clever clues and so forth, but the writing itself is uniformly excellent, and this book is no exception.<br /><br />On the 20th anniversary of the LA riots, Harry Bosch gets to revisit one of the crimes that stuck in his craw. He *wanted* to investigate the murder of a young female Danish photojournalist and war correspondent back when the riots happened, but there were too many other things happening, and he wasn't senior enough to insist and get his way. It's bothered him ever since, and now on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the riots, the old cases are being opened up and reinvestigated, and Harry asks for this one.<br /><br />Of course, Connelly being Connelly, the case leads from one clue and piece of evidence to another. Everything from office politics to gang culture gets into the story, with Harry doggedly plugging away, unraveling what happened methodically and carefully. When the solution presents itself, you probably saw it coming for awhile, but still, it's believable and interesting.<br /><br />I'd recommend this book to almost anyone. Good mystery.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Good fun,helps your focus, and very entertaining.<br />Helps keep me and grandkids occupied for hours at a time. Gives granma a break. Lol
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I'm a white noise junkie and have tried many different apps. The sound quality of this app is superb and the extras are so nice. My favorite is the ease of use for making custom sound mixes. Any two water sounds and I drift off to sleep.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Loved this book. The sadness of an abused child by those who should have cared for him was well balanced by the kindness meted out when he was an adult and the humorous mixed up metaphors as expressed by Rose - &#34;I'll put my thinking hat to the grindstone&#34;. The ending was satisfactorily realistic - and surprising.
B009AMANBA|2.0|The movie, is, of course, wonderful.  My lack of stars is about the dvd copy I received.  I selected the less expensive dvd to purchase thinking the price had just gone down with time or did not include extras.  Turns out it's less expensive because of at least one flaw in the copy that I've noticed.  My copy had the reflection of an open yellow umbrella floating on the forehead of Mary Lincoln in the carriage ride toward the end.  Really!  What's with that?  I know you get what you pay for, but it would be nice to know why the price is less in order to make a decision.  I was amused when the notice about piracy played at the end.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I agree with most of the low reviews that this book should have wrapped up the series.  I mean how many \\"sex tapes\\" can there be in one lifetime?  Just dragging out the story of Brett and Eva is stretching it a bit far, especially due the the evolution of the relationship between Gideon and Eva.  Don't get me wrong, I loved all of the HOT scenes and the intrigue about Corinne, but let's end it somewhere Sylvia.  You can only drag a good story so far and then all of us readers will get tired.... Yes, I will probably buy the next book and I'm sure that what the author wants, but at least FIFTY SHADES had the decency to end on a high note.  So much conflict can just get old after a while, especially when it takes almost a year to get to the next chapter.  Having said all of that, I think that it's very tempting to leave Eva and Gideon alone now and more on in my reading to another couple.  So, maybe I won't be around for book four and never for book five.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Challenging but solvable. I enjoyed this app. I would recommend this to those gammers who like a mixture of hunting for clues and working out combinations.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|As the description says, buy this adapter instead of the whole power supply if you've got an old MagSafe power supply.  This is an 1/8th of the price of the OEM power supply, and I was scared away by faulty equipment reviews on the off brands.  This works and it's pretty cheap.  I have the old MacBook Pro power supply, and I'm using this to connect to a new MacBook Air.  I've had absolutely no problems with this converter.  It's very small as it's about the size of the actual Mac-side plug, so it doesn't make the power adapter stick out much further.  Also, the connection to the MagSafe side is very strong.  When the plug falls out of my new Air, it's because the MagSafe 2 side, which is significantly weaker in attraction even on the full cords, disconnected instead of the MagSafe side.<br /><br />Seriously - get this converter if you're just upgrading Macs.  Heck, it's cheaper (currently) to buy an old MagSafe power supply and this adapter than to buy a brand new Apple brand MagSafe 2 power supply.
B005S9EK5Y|1.0|An ardent fan of the musical, I could not wait for this movie adaptation.  Though it earns its one star for effort, that effort delivers a musical movie that is claustrophobic, tortured and which strips the lush score from its passion and bigness at every turn.  The performances are isolated and disconnected from one another, and seem to be played only to the camera, which make them feel disembodied.  Everyone is heaving, sweating, dying, crying, sobbing, red-rimmed eyes swimming in dirty tears and gasps of pain.  The theatrical uplift and beauty of the musical version truly brings a heavenly respite from all this darkness, whereas the movie has no such comfort for its viewers.  Clearly, I see others' views are the opposite, and sure enough, when I saw this film in the theater many audience members were sobbing in the final scenes.  I bolted for the door.

B00CV5BODY|4.0|This fine bargain edition of live recordings of the complete Schubert symphonies uses the new numbering now that it has been proved that the supposedly lost Gmunden-Gastein symphony is the same as the \\"Great\\", D.944, formerly called the Ninth but now known as Schubert's Eighth and last symphony; thus, correspondingly, the \\"Unfinished\\" is now the Seventh.<br /><br />These are by and large tenser and tauter interpretations than the genial, relaxed manner typified by many previous, celebrated interpreters. At times Maazel pushes hard and thus does not quite conjure the wit and charm that Beecham brought to his Schubert, but, these are still beautifully played performances, demonstrating that Maazel is a deft, alert, flexible Schubertian. The woodwind and horns are especially grateful on the ear; the recording acoustic is slightly \\"fat\\" and boomy but warm, with barely a sound from the audience and all sections of the orchestra very well balanced.<br /><br />The early symphonies are not necessarily masterpieces and contain nothing especially memorable. Their free-flowing melodies occasionally flirt with banality but Maazel brings out their wit, tunefulness and vivacity, nicely judging the triple-time dance rhythms which alternate with more dramatic passages and conjuring up the bitter-sweet melancholy so typical of Schubert's idiom. The youthful dynamism of the Allegro vivace finale to the First Symphony carries over to the opening movement of the Second, making me wonder if Mendelssohn was familiar with it. There is kind of domestic cosiness to the Andante, then the rustic Menuetto and Trio and Presto vivace fourth movement are despatched with zest and energy.<br /><br />Beecham's classic recording has long been the touchstone for the Third; it seems to me that he achieves a more characterful and better shaped \\"maestoso\\" opening than Maazel, encompassing more light and shade; Maazel strikes a more serious and restrained pose, with heavy timpani thwacks on the downbeat in the Allegretto, suggestive of a certain solemn, Beethovenian seriousness but also borrowing that composer's propulsion and drive. The Menuetto and finale are both taken much faster than Beecham and as such are of a piece with Maazel's more dynamic interpretative stance. I was further surprised to find myself preferring the clarity of Beecham's 1958/59 recording, despite its age and hiss and with Maazel I miss Beecham's touches, such as his knowing little hesitations, and to me, this is the least successful in Maazel's survey of these symphonies.<br /><br />Maazel's treatment of the Fourth is urgent and vital, especially hard driven in the Allegretto of the fourth movement, culminating in a thrilling prestissimo climax. In the Allegro of the Fifth, again, fleetness is the predominant characteristic at the expense of charm; Beecham takes a more measured, nuanced approach affording him the more time to make points while Maazel skates over the music. On the other hand, Maazel adopts a dreamier, more affectionate manner in the Andante; this movement proves the exception to Maazel's generally brisker tempi but he reverts to type in the propulsive Allegro vivace which concludes the work.<br /><br />This general sprightliness pays off in the Andante of the Sixth which is truly flowing, whereas Beecham's chosen speed is decidedly closer to an Adagio and drains the movement of energy. The final movement is hardly \\"moderato\\" but the scurrying Bavarian strings are fully up to their conductor's demands and take the audience on a breath-taking ride, heightening the similarity between its main theme and the Allegro vivace of the Eighth. Maazel is taking liberties here but I think he has found a solution to preventing that last movement sounding trite; Beecham opts instead for a more measured, ironic and whimsical approach.<br /><br />For all the incidental delights in the first six symphonies, any complete set must stand or fall by the quality of the Seventh and Eighth, especially as truly satisfying recordings of the latter are not exactly numerous. I have always favoured Szell and Barbirolli until I recently discovered the live performance by Knappertsbusch with the VPO in 1957 and that has become my new favourite, although all three are very fine.<br /><br />Maazel's performance of D.944 brings weight and grandeur to the tutti sections of the first movement but I would like to hear sharper articulation of the dotted rhythm opening to the Andante con moto. The Scherzo is first swift then sweetly fluid but Maazel's treatment of the second subject is almost casual, prefiguring a kind of rustic Schwung more redolent of Dvor&aacute;k. Other conductors (Barbirolli and Kna) make less of a contrast between the subjects or take the whole thing at more of a lick (Szell); Maazel establishes a more telling contrast. He gives us a convincing, coherent vision.<br /><br />The performance of D.759 is graced by gorgeous instrumental tone in every department. The opening is rather more deliberately played than with Szell, who creates a more arresting sense of brooding mystery whereas Maazel goes for a mood of nervous tension; he is also more attentive to dynamics. He opts at 3'31\\" to take the three minute repeat and majestically executes the disturbing middle section when a succession of weighty chords introduces the search to regain the home key. The Andante con moto is delightful; lyrical and bucolic - especially so in the development section where the woodwind are prominent.<br /><br />There is much to enjoy here and this makes an excellent complete edition, even if individual recordings do not necessarily supersede established favourites.ly as truly satisfying recordings of the latter are not exactly numerous.

B00BEXB18M|1.0|I would slot this album right after Risk and well before The World Needs A Hero as the second worst Megadeth album. Since at least TWNAH actually has a couple of decent tracks and both Risk and Supercollider do not. This is disposable pedestrian metal lite with nothing to offer in the way of catchy or memorable riffs or songs and the lyrics are hilarious garbage. If Risk and TWNAH and maybe MD.45 b-sides are your thing you will love it, otherwise avoid this album like the plague. It has 2 listens worth of value at best and the second will only be to double check how bad it is in case you doubted. I saw this coming with the half baked Th13teen and Mustaines interviews leading up to this release, so I suppose I will just have to wait until his umpteenth wannabe Jimmy Page phase passes and the band fractures and goes to the brink again. Cos hindsight is 20/20 eh Dave...
1781162646|5.0|`WORK CLOSE TO HEAVEN!'<br /><br />That was the advertisement that Mr Devin Jones one Summer reacted to, and this stand up guy at the age of twenty one was soon to become Howie the Happy Hound suited up in Hound attire doing the Hokey Pokey dance with kids at Joyland, a fun amusement park, a place where fun was lived out in its highs of rides and pitch darkness of the Horror House.<br />There is unfortunately no tunnel of love, just in case anyone reading wants to hope on a flight out to Joyland. The nearest to a tunnel of love is the Horror House but as you embark on that ride, with zombies and skeletons leaping out of nowhere to surprise you in the dark, watch out for any lonesome dame stranded, lurking, wearing a blue skirt and blue sleeveless blouse and a matching blue Alice band, she is not part of the outfit, the fun, she is out of place in Joyland, her presence, the mystery behind her, the suspense that surrounds her is the hook in the tale, one of which our master storyteller Mr Stephen King has used to great success i have to say, one to have you hooked and transported to this summer and the lead characters days working at Joyland.<br /><br />Published by Hard Case Crime, a publishing house that specialises in suspense, mystery and noir, its no surprise that King chose them to tell this throwback suspense and mystery story. He has used a great setting a theme park, just liked great stories such as Something wicked This way Comes by Ray Bradbury, a memorable and strong character is present with the young protagonist Mr Devin Jones with hero qualities and some flaws, and another even better character Mike a young boy who is severely ill and wheelchair bound, you will also read of some love for the main character one gone and a possibly another to be gained.<br />This story has the reader ponder and read over the good days that have past, the love that was lost and found, the death that was faced and the life that managed to live on, a quaint feeling left uponthe reader cast, on the good people lost and struck from this earth but the wonderful memories that lay and they left behind.<br />Joyland somewhere, somehow, may be found across the world, across seas and across lands, in hearts and minds, through efforts and great human endeavor, in fun-houses, parks, and happy days, everyone has some fun-house days to remember, recollect and reflect on the silver-lining and on the others of whom have left behind a memory gone from this passing world but never be forgotten.<br />A modest story can have great ramifications and reverberations, there is a power present in this great storytelling and one of which I am in awe of Stephen Kings ability to do right, he connects and transports his reader.<br />In this tale he weaves you slowly in, with the telling of the main character Devin Jones and his humble efforts on a summer job at Joyland, a place of fun, and slowly revels some darkness and then some light with the great character Mike and his dreams of being out of his wheelchair high up in the sky on a ride, like the kite he regularly reels from his seat, as dreams are forged, and he breathes the air you have the great feeling of freedom he must have felt and then the darkness comes again and then.......the rest lays in wait for you to read this Summer, run and buy it in truck loads and give out for free.<br /><br />Excerpts<br /><br />\\"I remember Mike's day at the park--Annie's day, too--as if it happened last week, but it would take a correspondent much more talented than I am to tell you how it felt, or to explain how it could have ended the last hold Wendy Keegan still held over my heart and my emotions. All I can say is what you already know: some days are treasure. Not many, but I think in almost every life there are a few. That was one of mine, and when I'm blue-when life comes down on me and everything looks tawdry and cheap, the way Joyland Avenue did on a rainy day--I go back to it, if only to remind myself that life isn't always a butcher's game. Sometimes the prizes are real. Sometimes they're precious.\\"<br /><br />\\"This is a badly broken world, full of wars and cruelty and senseless tragedy. Every human being who inhabits it is served his or her portion of unhappiness and wakeful nights. Those of you who don't already know that will come to know it. Given such sad but undeniable facts of the human condition, you have been given a priceless gift this summer: you are here to sell fun. In exchange for the hard-earned dollars of your customers, you will parcel out happiness. Children will go home and dream of what they saw here and what they did here. I hope you will remember that when the work is hard, as it sometimes will be, or when people are rude, as they often will be, or when you feel your best efforts have gone unappreciated. This is a different world, one that has its own customs and its own language, which we simply call the Talk. You'll begin learning it today. As you learn to talk the Talk, you'll learn to walk the walk. I'm not going to explain that, because it can't be explained; it can only be learned.\\"<br />more2read.com
B00555X8OA|4.0|Very insightful and thought provoking.<br /><br />There is a lot to grasp here, so it becomes the kind of book which, no matter how many times you pick it back up for a re-read, you will always find something new to take away.<br /><br />It is not too technical of a book, so getting immersed into it is easy as well.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Great perspective by an enemy fighter pilot torn between honor and duty.  Great battle scenes give a fighter pilot view of combat.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|This is a nice looking clock with a good alarm. I have not found it to be a battery hog. I do think that it would be wise to use it plugged in so that it doesn't kill the battery and leave you sleeping in the morning.

B00768D664|4.0|Peter Lynch has a good knowledge of Wall Street and did well in picking stocks over a period of several consecutive years. There is also little doubt that his investment strategies worked for him. This book is a good read if all one wants to know is how Peter Lynch thinks he was able to beat the Street during the time he managed the Fidelity Magellan fund. So, if you're going to read it, read it as an autobiography of Peter Lynch and maybe to get a few pointers along the way for picking stocks.<br /><br />But be forewarned of a couple things. First, many of the strategies Lynch used to pick stocks are not readily available to the individual investor. Perhaps if the individual investor has the capital to buy tens of thousands of shares of a particular stock, he or she can do some of the things Lynch did. But most individual investors are not in this position. Moreover, as a fund manager Lynch had easy access to a tremendous amount of information, some of which is either not readily available to the individual investor or would require a prohibitive amount of time to access the amount needed to make a truly informed decision.<br /><br />Second, Lynch is confident that he had a superior record and beat the street because of his superior investment skills. This may be, but at the same time it is not as obvious as it may seem. Conduct the following experiment (either by actually doing it or thinking through it in your head––the latter is preferable because it can be done a whole lot more quickly). Take a thousand pennies. Flip each one of them. Put the heads in one pile and the tails in another. After one series of coin flips you will have approximately 500 heads. Take those 500 and flip them a second time. You'll have approximately 250 that come up heads twice in a row. After the third coin flip you will have about 125 that come up heads a third time, 63 a fourth time, 32 a fifth time, 16 a sixth time, 8 a seventh time, 4 an eighth time, 2 a ninth time, and on average 1 will have come up heads ten times in a row. Given that there are more than a thousand mutual fund managers, even if picking the right funds is a matter of chance, one of those managers should beat the Street ten straight times. Perhaps Peter Lynch was that manager. We can't say for sure one way or the other.ge 1 will have come up heads ten times in a row. Given that there are more than a thousand mutual fund managers, even if picking the right funds is a matter of chance, one of those managers should beat the Street ten straight times.

B004MKM8L8|5.0|AWESOME MOVIE, AWESOME FRANCHISE!!!!!!!!!!!! As usual it is awesome and should continue like THE HOBBITS, STAR WARS, IRON MAN, SHERLOCK HOLMES,INDIANNA JONES etc. Some spooky/scary? Probably not for small children.

B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I love this book! It has all of the elements of an epic fantasy novel, great writing (particularly impressive given that I read the self-published version), a compelling hero, and lots of adventure. I was hooked from the first chapter, and it even wrapped up well for a first book in a series. I would highly recommend this book as a stand-alone read, but I'm still eagerly awaiting the next book in the series.
B000MGB6M8|5.0|TOTALLY AWESOME!!!! Action, adventure, comedy, hired assisins what more could you ask for? Your right, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt! The first movie I ever liked him in. Loved everyone of Angelinas!

B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This is a nice application, it is practical and useful.  However, it does contain the occasional advertisement which is quite annoying.  Other then that it is as good as any other calculator application.<br /><br />Why Amazon felt the urge to not include such a practical and generic application is a mystery, but at least there are alternatives out there.

B000OZ0NXA|5.0|So I'm not a big reader.  I mostly read technical and educational books.  My wife said you enjoyed the movie read the novel, you might like it.  I went on my Kindle and saw it for $2.99 on sale-  So I purchased the book.<br /><br />The easiest way to describe the book is it is like water; it addressed several aspects to each character.  Which gave you the depth and descriptions required to truly invoke your imagination.  But then it is almost like these individual water molecules came together to create an enjoyable, complex story.<br /><br />Once the pieces start to fall into place this book grabs you and doesn't let go.  It was suspenseful, thrilling, and mysterious.<br /><br />** Important: **<br />The book was a blast to read it did include some language and extreme violence.  Essentially one of the more violent scenes from the book:<br /><br />&#34;He was naked.  They nailed him to the wall.  Six or seven big carpentry nails through his hands and up his arms.  Through the fleshy parts.  They nailed his feet to the floor.  Then they sliced off his balls off.  Just hacked them off, blood everywhere. ... The balls were found in the stomach of the wife. ... &#34;<br /><br />It goes into even more detail and description but that is an idea to one of the more violent portions of the book.  So if your sensitive, or wary of children reading this sort of material then it may not be the best read for you.  If you can stomach some of these encounters the book is a complete blast.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Although my feedback is late, the rumors are that they are coming back again! George Lucas (Spielberg). I hope so.  You must see the blurays they are totally awesome! &#34;MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU, FOREVER!&#34;.

B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Simple yet profound. Every married couple should read this book. Even if you've been married for 30 years and your spouse is unresponsive or unwilling to get counseling, read it.  I wish I had read this book many years ago.  It will not work miracles though until you both get to the point where you recognize the need to express love in your spouse's love language. But this book will help get there.  I highly recommend it!
B002ZG9774|5.0|CHER &#34;THE DIVA&#34; and Christina Agullera together what a movie. The songs are awesome, movie is awesome, cast is awesome. Another &#34;DIVA&#34; performance by CHER if only she sang more than two songs!

B008AK8FHM|4.0|I felt it was written for physicians so that they could keep an open mind about what their patients related to them and maybe change their own opinion.  Some of things I'd read before about other people experiences regarding life after death.  Interesting story.
B004P9FAK2|5.0|Totally AWESOME. One of the best franchise movies of all time. Spooky/scarry at times but the action does not stop! Probably not for small children because of the content. I hope they bring it back like the HOBBIT has done and is still going on!
B0063IH60K|5.0|lots of fun! Can't stop playing. Easy to see. Easy to read. You have options to make it your own.
B001DSNF8C|5.0|My wife and I agree that this is the very best BOND MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!! I have purchased all the Bonds on dvd/bluray! This one has so much action you can hardly breathe! Daniel Craig Forever!!!!!!
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|I recently read J. R. R. Tolkien's &#34;The Hobbit&#34; to my daughter as a bedtime story, and, as I book that I started reading as a child and put down because I found it boring, I rather enjoyed as an adult.  The story is often considered children's literature, but there is much, much more to Tolkien's story than a simple adventure.  A lot of the humor and social criticism is lost on anyone not old enough to understand what he was trying to say.  And it truly is an excellent story.<br /><br />With that said, my wife really wanted to go see &#34;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey&#34; when it was in the theaters.  However, she was rather pregnant at the time, and we never wound up making the trip.  After convincing her to do a 3-day &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; marathon, she wound up really enjoying the story as well as the individual movies.  Therefore, I pre-ordered the Blu-Ray 3D/Blu-Ray/DVD + UltraViolet edition, and we waited anxiously for it to arrive.  With the story fresh in my memory, I was curious to see how Peter Jackson would take a 200-plus page novel and turn it into a 3-film epic.<br /><br />Over the years, I've heard many complaints about the liberties taken with &#34;The Lord of the Rings&#34; in how the story was told from multiple perspectives.  My response to these complaints was to wave my hand in dismissal and remind the complainer that they have to give some leeway when taking an established novel and interpreting it into film.  Liberties HAVE to be taken; it's almost always how it goes.  With that said, I had a hard time swallowing a lot of what was filmed for &#34;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.&#34;  I may be blowing things out of proportion here, but only about half of what happened in the film was actually in the book.  A LOT of liberties were taken with the making of this film, and I can only imagine how much additional material will be added to the following two films.<br /><br />Saying that, the film, in and of itself, is an enjoyable experience.  If you're a long-time fan(atic) of the original novel, please accept this film as an &#34;interpretive dance&#34; version of the pre-&#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; universe as a whole.  If you've never read the novel, please, by all means, watch the film.  Just understand that the book, if you decide to read it, is a rather different animal.  And if you have no intention whatsoever in reading the book, chances are you'll love this film, especially if you love the &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; films.<br /><br />In conclusion, I could have done without all the liberties taken with the story to make this a 3-film epic like &#34;The Lord of the Rings.&#34;  It was a bit much for me, and, as someone who has minimal background in the world of J. R. R. Tolkien's Hobbitverse, I have no clue where it all came from.  My only guess is that these films will be the last Hobbitverse films made, so they're trying to cram in as much material as humanly possible.e experience.

B009AZZEU2|1.0|Just heard this cd and my first thoughts where true , Another grunge group holding on to a long gone era of music ! All the rosie reviews of other reviewers cant hide the lack of heart the grunge era bands are displaying with cds like this one ! While it has one or 2 okay songs its not worth the money you would spend on it .
B005G4TJI4|5.0|Awesome movie series. Plenty of action, aliens, fights, transformers, action packed! Not for very small  children, other children play with the Transformer action figures.

B003G4W49C|5.0|An exciting read with deep truths that will make you ponder the world you live in. Whether you love it or loath it, it will invoke strong emotions as you fall in love with the distraught boy who is forced to shoulder the fate of mankind.

B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game! Its not very detailed....... but that's what makes it fun! Its also just the right amount of difficulty, which I think people like. I encourage all u people out there,  to get this cool game.
B000E1NWGO|5.0|Folks my age (pushing 60) grew up with Rubinstein's album of popular Beethoven sonatas and possibly formed our opinion of how they should sound by his performances.  The sound is warm and without extremes in tempos and effects (just as in his Chopin).  His performances are of historical interest now because he was one of the last pianists who learned from the nineteenth century teachers who had connections to the composers of the classical and romatic period.  Historical interest aside, Rubinstein was a master musician whom the piano and the music composed for it came naturally, whatever the genre.  (People usually think of him as a romantic, but he was a champion of Stravinsky, Debussy, etc, when their music was considered unlistenable, and also played excellent versions of Bach which he seldom recorded.)  These recordings show that he had an excellent mind for Beethoven and why he didn't record more of the sonatas, since he knew them all, is a mystery.  I suppose that these are no longer essential, as they were in the 60's and 70's, since there are so many excellent versions available, in all forms of sanity and insanity.  But for me, this album is the first one I feel inclined to play when I want to listen to the Moonlight, etc. As for the sound problems that some of the reviewers have complained about, hisses and the like don't bother me since I grew up listening to vinyls that were full of scratches.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is in my opinion way better than temple run. It is fun and you learn something new every time you play.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham has a formula for his legal thrillers that work really well.  This protagonist is atypical and initially portrayed as a simpleton, but later comes out on top.
B009EHDU7U|3.0|It began as very funny but somehow became less so. I became confused over wheter it was based on fact or pure fantasy
B003WKOU0G|5.0|Great movie :-)  rather, it's a documentary. I just wish it included more footage.<br /><br />Really enjoyable. I highly recommend it, especially if you like babies.
0553386794|3.0|300,000 words and it seems 100,000 of them are the word \\"sweet.\\" There must be a few more adjectives to choose from in the English language.

B006LSZECO|3.0|Great book from the start. Wonderful flow throughout. Horrible ending. It felt like it should have wrapped up somehow. There was no resolution.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This is a fantastic game; but it is too short. I wish they would of made it longer then it is or they make a sequel to it

098555780X|5.0|I'm a beginner in the world of paracord knots and so far have only done zipper pulls.  From my perspective it is easier to watch YouTube videos but when the Internet isn't available this book is great.  Since I'm rating the book and not what can be found on the Internet this book is what they say it is and I'm happy with my purchase and I do recommend this book to others.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I haven't finished the book yet but I do love it so far.  For those of you that do not follow Sylvia Day on twitter, she announced that there will be 5 books in the Crossfire series.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|A quick read and kept me wanting more. I think it's good to touch on mental illness and how people can still live normally with great support. Can't wait to see the movie.
014103579X|1.0|Update to review below: Don't waste your money on a hideous book: Watch the original 4-part BBC series on YouTube instead. It's all the good things that people say about the book, without the ordeal.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />I wanted to like this book. I'm a typesetter and page designer with 35 years experience, and I've spent a lot of time thinking about art and photographic images, including their history and the history of the culture that shapes the way we see them.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the book has to be one of the ugliest I've ever run across, with its heavy black Univers type and deep paragraph indents. The photos of the art are muddy, perhaps because the book is a reproduction of an earlier edition. It's surprising that a book that's supposed to carry some insights about seeing could be so visually repulsive. After I struggled to read the first few pages, I didn't care what Berger had to say. I guess I'll have to read some Walter Benjamin instead.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I loved it one of the best games on my kindle! with a new place to visit every month it's so much fun.
B00847KFDS|5.0|I wasn't sure about how much I'd like this CD when I preordered it,but was I pleasently surprized after listening to it a few times.The highlight for me was hearing Bob Seger with John and Bob playing piano.Was also nice hearing John's sons on this CD.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|This is the first review I have ever written on amazon. Writing it to add to the chorus of angry voices about this so called. trilogy. Wish I had not bought it because of how poorly written it was and for how cheated I feel about the deception of continuing a supposed trilogy. Done supporting Ms. Day.
B008OOYALE|2.0|This game is okay, but frustrating and expensive if you wanted to take advantage of their offers for special dragons.  I<br />There are a lot of pop-ups which I find a bit annoying, and mating dragons, hatching eggs, waiting for expansions to complete, removing trees, etc. all take hours to complete.  I don't like the fact that you have to spend real money to buy their gold if you want to get a special dragon.  It takes a minimum of 600 gold to get a rare dragon egg, and the only way to get gold is from friends (with a limit of 3 gifts per day) or to purchase it with real money.  This is one game that I will rarely play, if ever.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great read, easy read. Love this book and the whole series. Would highly recommend to readers of any age! Loved it!
B009NY43NY|5.0|Loved this book, sad to see the series end, but loved how it all came together in the end! Thank charlaine Harris for bringing Skokie Stackhouse  to life she was Truely memorable.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Yep, there will be more of Gideon for however long the author decides to drag it out.  When I read the first two books, I anticipated to read the last one in three months but it did not happen.  It took eight months to get this book from the last one.  Now I have to wait another 4-6 months for the next book and I don't even know if it will be the last one either.  Ms. Day is a great author so there is no reason she could not come up with new material to write instead of rehashing the over the same issues.    Many readers want more Gideon so I must be in the minority.  Don't get me wrong, I love Gideon and Eva.  However, I want them to get their HEA.  What happened to the trilogy?  if I have known ahead of time there will be 4-6 books in this series, I wouldn't even read it until all of them are out.    Pissed off is not even enough to describe my feelings right now. BTW, I did not even read this book yet.  I scrolled to the end to find out if it has a HEA and saw her short message to readers that there will be more of Gideon and Eva. Hell no, there will be no more of Gideon and Eva for me.  I am returning Entwined With You! I wish I could return the first two books as well.  I am SO done with this author.    Follow up:  Yes, I checked Syvia Day's official website.  This series was supposed to be a trilogy at one point.  See below:    [...]    Crossfire Series  Sylvia Day's NYT and USA Today bestselling self-published Bared to You and two more books in the Crossfire trilogy, following an emotionally damaged young couple's erotic and tumultuous relationship, to Cindy Hwang at Berkley, in a major deal, with the digital reissue on May 24, 2012 and the paperback release on June 12, 2012, by Kimberly Whalen at Trident Media Group (world English).

B008JFUP0I|5.0|Warning: this review contains a few minor spoilers on the awesomeness of this film.<br /><br />I have to update the Fast and Furious series rankings after seeing this film.  They are now:<br />1) The Fast and The Furious<br />2) Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift (I realize this is the one spot that is very controversial among us F&Faholics)<br />3) Fast & Furious 6 - by the slightest of margins over #4<br />4) Fast & Furious<br />5) Fast Five - Still an excellent Film<br />...<br />...<br />2nd to last) any other car racing or heist film, even if it does not include Vin Diesel or Han.<br />last) 2 fast 2 furious.<br /><br />Now that we have gotten that out of the way, let's get to the meat and potatoes.  Vin Diesel appearing to be the same height as The Rock will make me laugh every time I see it.  Maybe in the F&F world I would be as tall as Yao Ming.  What is Diesel standing on, Tyrese's music career?  I would additionally like to know who takes the most PED's leading up to the filming.  I would probably put The Rock #1, but Luda is ripped too now, which really came out of left field.<br /><br />Three other investigations I would like to see:<br />1) How long was the runway at the end of this film?  At what point did they cross over country lines?  Did they need to show passports?<br />2) Which was more awesome, when Dees (I hope he doesn't mind if I call him Dees) jumped to save Michelle Rodriguez falling off the tank  OR  When Dees drove the car through the nose of the plane?  Both were incredibly realistic.<br />3) Yeah right Letty is still alive.  Come on.  You expect me to believe that?  That is almost as plausible as Vin Diesel being as tall as The Rock.<br /><br />In closing, the Fast and Furious series is wonderful as everyone knows.  Don't stop boys, keep up the good work.  This is all possible due to the incredibly talented actors (Save Paul Walker and Michelle Rodriguez... oops sorry).  That being said, there is one man who rises above the rest.  The most eloquent asian car racer/loveable criminal I know.  Han saved this series and is awesome in every possible way.  #teamhan<br /><br />\\"You can have any beer you want, as long as it's a corona.\\"loquent asian car racer/loveable criminal I know.

B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Daniel Day Lewis almost carries this film, as well as Sally Field's stunning performance. However, this movie drags along slowly.
B000JPRPAO|5.0|I'm a push over for great car chase scenes, and once again Jason (AKA Handsome) did not let me down.  And I like &#34;smart crime&#34; movies, and this is definitely one of those. So 5 stars it is. My husband tells me this isn't the only one of these films...hmmmmm
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Bradely Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Robert DeNiro...it's an all star cast and extremely well-acted. It was cute and it was funny. My fiance even enjoyed it! Not the revelatory movie breaking ground on mental illness issues that everyone says it is, though.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Gillian Flynn's latest novel Gone Girl was a gripping psychological roller coaster from start to finish. A cleverly crafted profile of narcissistic obsession and entanglement. You need to set aside a weekend because you won't be able to put this book down. Brilliant!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show will make you wish the world was overtaken by zombies so you could test your mad zombie-fighting skills. I was really skeptical about this show until I watched the first episode. Then I was hooked. You might not leave your couch all weekend once you start watching this show!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Very disappointed with the ending.  Love the characters, but not wrapping up this story in this book is a huge let down. I truly feel this story could have been condensed already much less dragging it out for 2 more books! Books 1 and 2 were much better and the way this one ended was very disappointing. I do not understand why she feels there must 5 in this series.  Dragging it out way to much, in my opinion. Especially to pay $9.99 for it!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|yay this game is fun yay go dragonvale this is fun and yeah go play it its for free anyways
B00CW665VI|5.0|Funny and entertaining, best romance I've read in a long time! Do not let this one slip away, it is a must read if you like romantic comedies with lots of steamy love scenes.
0131103628|5.0|Great book, anyone who wants to learn C should get this book. There are books that go into way more depth but this is an essential for anyone who wants to learn C, or anyone who works with C to use as a reference.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is fun. It's hard to put it down sometimes. I really enjoy it. I would recommend this game.
B00C061I3K|5.0|This album is awesome. My favorite track would have to be &#34;Lose Yourself to Dance.&#34; If you like House/Dance music this is a must buy as all other Daft punk albums.
B009KLGZTU|5.0|This review is for the the serivice I received and not the product.  It was excellent!  The dvd was defective, their response to correct the problem was most impressive, they acted on it after contacting them with my concern.  One can't go wrong with a purchase from these guys!
B00CXN2JNS|4.0|Think the styles of CTE, Youthanasia, CW and Risk all smooshed into 1 album... and you have Super Collider.<br />It's not a super fast, thrash album. It's more mid tempo, and melodic. HOWEVER, that doesn't mean that it's a bad album. Not in the least.<br />Almost every single song on this album is good to great.<br /><br />I actually enjoyed the bluegrass inspiration on The Blackest Crow, and it ended up being one of my favorite songs on the album.<br /><br />The 2nd half of Dance in the Rain is where you'll hear KIMB era Megadeth. LOVE IT.<br />Super fast. Super heavy. Super AWESOME.<br /><br />I only deducted 1 star from my rating because I felt that the album could have used more songs like the the 2nd half of Dance in the Rain. I think it would have tied the album together a bit better.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game was sup much fun couldn't put it down! This game is the best of them all do I think every one should get this super fun game
B004QZ9P6K|5.0|I would recommend this to everyone who is intrest ed in how a country begin to grow and become  vibrant Nation.

Thanks i truly am grateful to this app.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|My son loves any of the Angry Bird apps.  He started with using them on my iPhone and now has most of them on our Kindle Fire.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I write this review coming straight off another gaming mouse, the Gigabyte M8000X with GHOST Macro Engine. The initial reason for buying this product was because it was everything I was looking for initially when I bought the Gigabyte, and I intended to sell off or gift the one I no longer needed. That said, both mice have their advantages and disadvantages, and I'll highlight the differences between them and features of the Anker.<br /><br />First off, the weighting system. The Anker has 8 small weights, any number of which you can put into the back end of your mouse. However, the Gigabyte has four, including one much larger weight, and that weight plus two of the smaller adds up to more than the total of all eight of the small Anker weights. This is really no problem unless you've gotten used to a higher weight, but even then it's fairly easy to adjust.<br /><br />Secondly, the grip and button placement. Everything feels right on the Anker, especially the small thumb rest on the left side. You can grip it naturally and the buttons will largely stay out of your way until you need them. The Gigabyte isn't quite as natural: you have to move your hand up slightly further than you might be used to, you might bump one of the two side buttons. Ultimately, the only complaint about the Anker is that the scroll wheel has been made slightly smaller than some in order to make room for the button at the tip of the mouse, and it doesn't scroll to the side like the Gigabyte does. That said, it's only a small adjustment and still feels quite nice.<br /><br />Third, the buttons and customization software. Both mice come with their own customization software, but I find Anker's to be more versatile. GHOST does not allow the changing of a button to any individual key unless you turn a macro into that key, whereas Anker's software simply does it. However, there are a few more profiles usable on the GHOST software than on Anker's, albeit you can save and load more anytime you wish. The button that is used to change the DPI on both mice is a small but significant different between the two mice, however: on the Gigabyte, it's a small switch which can be pushed either way to make the DPI go either up or down, but with Anker it's only a single button which increases and then loops around. This isn't a huge deal however, as the button next to it can be made to take the DPI down if you wish, although you'll lose whatever other functionality you could have had on that button.
0316247545|5.0|My Little Pony: The Elements of Harmony: Friendship is Magic: The Official Guidebook is an awesome book. The intros are tear jerking. Reading a foreward and Q&A by Lauren Faust is insightful and awesome. All of the details that they bring to us, with little bubbles of quotes, concept art and other things are indeed inspiring and makes you smile. The little facts you learn in the beginning making you wonder 'what could have been?'<br /><br />All in all, if you're a brony or pegasister, know one, or are the parent of one--pick up this book today. You'll be 20% cooler in 10 seconds flat.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|I would have bought this just for the track \\"The Living Sculptures of Pemberly.\\"  I believe this was the point in the film where Elizabeth realized that she loved Mr Darcy.<br /><br />However, most of the other tracks are equally as beautiful.  They are especially touching if you are familiar with the movie and can associate the music with various scenes.
B0000CABBW|5.0|This is a definite must see...<br /><br />It's a little bit of a tear jerker, so man or woman up when watching.
B002VX0A40|5.0|My baby did not start grabbing toys early. We have been waiting while trying to teach him to reach out to a bunch of colorful toys. None of them had him interest enough to really reach out for. This pink little dragon was given at baby shower and it was the one that my baby like the most. He would stop crying when we shake it in front of him in the car. And guess what, it was the first toy he ever had enough interest to reach out and explore (4 months old). I was really glad. After that for days before he started grabbing on other toys solidly. I will buy another Lamaze soft toy today!
B001R0KH3M|5.0|The sound, the songs, the performance...all is excellent!!! A Great DVD to have and enjoy!!!!<br />For all Stevie wonder fans!!!
0140327592|4.0|The book of Matilda met my expectations of a 4-star review. It was a descriptive, cliff-hanger, great for 4th to 5th graders. From this story you could tell Dahl had been writing for years. The characters are well done, and it's a very 'smooth' read. 4 stars is my rating for 'Matilda' by Roald Dahl.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I bought this app and it is totally worth buying!! It gets really addictive! I could go all day playing this game!
B004XNGKBS|4.0|Got this app a few days ago, nicely priced as far as I'm concerned. $4 is not too much to pay, if it works well, and so far it does. I have had no problems with it closing unexpectedly or not working.<br />Notes save automatically, and if you use any type of word processing program you should be able to figure out the icons at the bottom. A couple I have yet to figure out, but they do not seem to detract from the use I will get.<br />Great for when you have your Kindle, but no pen or paper, as the screen is your paper and your finger the pen. Also have had no problem with it recognizing what I write. I found using your fingernail instead of the pad of your finger works best, slides easier that way and the line is slimmer and therefore more readable. Like using a Bic vs a Sharpie.<br />It seems for the most part, from reading past reviews and comparing them to my experience, that the developers have listened to the complaints, and fixed the major issues as they pop up.<br />Overall, great for those moments when you need to take notes, but have no paper/pen. Would not recommend for heavy use, but that's just me. I also would not want it for my phone, it doesnt seem compatible with that size screen for writing.

B00BRBIA6C|5.0|\\"We don't speculate. I never speculate in that way. It's just... the songs come to you, and you make the best of them.\\"<br />This response from Agnetha, when she was asked if it was her intention to reach the younger audience with her new album, probably sums up \\"A\\" the best.<br /><br />The album is not pretentious. Agnetha Fältskog is not out to prove anything [new]. She does not need to. Her track record speaks for itself. She is not trying to change her image or singing style, compete with today's sensational acts, or revolutionize pop music. She is just being herself. And that, in itself, is good enough for me. No, that's an understatement! That, to me, is actually ever so appealing and wonderful.<br /><br />Are these the greatest songs in the world? Not really.<br />Did they make the best possible sound and delivery? Absolutely, YES!<br /><br />You can put the album in a loop, and not one track needs to be skipped. The songs are ordered ingeniously, someone made sure there's a mid-tempo or upbeat track in-between the ballads. When the last track is reached, it feels very natural to circle back to the first track. With key transposition, the ending chord of the last song becomes the first 2 notes of the opening track. How clever!<br /><br />From the first track (an easy favorite), one would immediately recognize the Voice, so pure and clear; her no-nonsense, no-detour, just-hit-the-notes singing style - still very much intact. Yes, Agnetha is back!<br /><br />Agnetha's voice is as affecting as ever. There's an added depth. She can still sound crystal-clear like her polished ABBA recordings but now there is a conscious effort to showcase her lower range. One can hear deeper and fuller timbres that may not be so familiar (except, perhaps most obvious in her 2004 bossa-nova styled \\"Fly Me to the Moon\\"), but nonetheless quite endearing. She has fully-developed the art of sounding hoarse on cue, and I absolutely love that!<br /><br />The stamina is still there and her restrained staccatos continue to work wonders. In \\"A\\", she is cool throughout; never overboard; no belting, and no sharp treble to turn down (unlike her 1983 \\"Wrap Your Arms Around Me\\" album). She does not stray from her forte, which is: injecting feelings into each song, adding nuances here and there, perhaps making a series of notes sound more melodious than on paper, but never altering, prolonging, or 'toying with' the tunes too badly such that the composer's original intent is lost - a crime most contemporary singers often mindlessly commit.<br /><br />Agnetha understands [first] the essence of a song - its musical structure - and [then] expertly delivers her vocals with razor-sharp precision. Listen to \\"The Winner Takes It All\\", \\"Sometimes When I'm Dreaming\\", \\"Happy New Year\\", \\"As Good As New\\", \\"Head Over Heels\\" and you will be convinced that nothing is accidental in her realm. Her diction, phrasing, breathing, pauses, sighs, and stresses (what she might call \\"little gimmicks\\") are all pre-planned on a blueprint and perfectly executed. The same can be said of \\"A\\". I can list her trademark style track-by-track, but that would spoil the fun for you.<br /><br />\\"A\\" is refreshing in its modern sound production. Of course, software was used to mix, edit, enhance, and fix slight imperfections. But the arrangements remain true to traditional pop form, as real instruments were used - for the most part - even including a full strings orchestra. Admittedly, I keep wondering if the sound of timpani, which is formidable in almost every track, is real or sourced.<br /><br />The songs are of varied pop styles, making each track interesting in its own skin/genre. There's a wide range of influences (Lennon, Carpenters, Carole King, The Eagles, Sade - to name a few) but all-in-all \\"A\\" stays in an era belonging to the past, notably the 70's. Thus, the effect was as if, time was frozen, and Agnetha emerged from where she left off. Such a brilliant idea, if you ask me.<br /><br/>Almost every track is a favorite, but if I have to choose, I'd go for \\"I Was a Flower\\" as my #1, especially the softer \\"Orchestral version\\" which is not on the album, by the way. (It is a download-only Amazon Germany exclusive.) I also love her duet with Gary Barlow because of its clever build-up and arrangement. The disco track \\"Dance Your Pain Away\\" is a favorite among ABBA fans. I think it is a very nice song, music and lyrics-wise. A lot of undertones in Agnetha's superb interpretation. I could never tire of \\"Past Forever\\". It has a wonderful bridge, followed by Agnetha's arresting forte/fortissimo: \\"and THAT's a long, long... time\\". (Swoon!) And last but not least, Agnetha's own composition \\"I Keep Them on the Floor Beside My Bed\\". There is no better tune matching that title catch phrase! The song really grows on you, and you are transported to a nostalgic past. \\"I lost myself in time...\\" indeed. And it is so stylishly arranged to fit that era.<br /><br />BUY the album. You will love every minute of it.

This is Cyndis' first Broadway Musical and I pray that it isn't her last or only score.  It is brght and breezy.  It rminds us how wonderful a Broadway musical is.  Cyndi and the ever fabulous and talented Harvey Fierstein have given us a reason to celebrate a less than successful season.

B008UCJ7KO|3.0|It kills me to give this book 3 stars, and that's being nice.  I loved Bared to you and Reflected in you and I love Sylvia Day!  That being said I was a little disappointed in this book.  I love Gideon and Eva and their stories but I feel the book kept building up and then fizzled.  I know there are two more books coming but are we going to have to wait another year to get answers about what actually happened in EWY?  I love their love but we needed some answers!  Instead of giving details on unanswered questions from previous books, it added knew ones and still didn't answer anything!  So frustrating!! I know a lot of people are saying that they are giving up and not going to continuing reading this series but I am not.  I'll wait for the next two books and pre-ordered them just like the first three and read them. Sad, but true! The book was well written and the perfect length, just needed more information for us crazy readers!!  I hope she isn't dragging it out for the money like some have mentioned but some times when these authors wait so long between books in the series, it really needs to be BAM, GREAT, EXCELLENT, 5 stars, or its going to be hard for people to like the books.  We get so excited for the next one and then wait so long and the anticipation is so great that the book is a let down. I know it doesn't take a day to write a book and there are many steps involving publishing but this book was done a long time ago and the release date pushed back and pushed back and it sat there while we waited and to be honest, it was a let down.  A really big let down.  It makes me sad cause I love Sylvia Day's books, but she is going to have to step it up for the next one or i'm afraid she is going to be losing lots of fans.  On to the next book....whenever that may be.

B003JSSPSY|5.0|I was so so so sad when it got cancelled. I love Kahlan and Richard. I wish the fans and the network could have saved this show. I really think the writing was getting so much better in season two and they were really dwelving into the heart of the stories, from the book.

B000QCS8TW|4.0|This book is about medieval life surounding wars over kingdoms which include violent mutilations, beheadings,  rape and  pillage, dead people's body parts attacking people, barbarians having sex animal style, and dragons coming to life after thousands of years.  Somehow as gross and base as some of the events are, the characters and the riviting story get under your skin.  The blood and guts and the devaluing of human life might be a turn off for some, and the multitude of characters being introduced throughout the story confusing, the bottom line is that A Game of Thrones is surprisingly absorbing,  and after a chapter or two very hard to put down.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game! It's the first thing I play when I turn on the Kindle. The more you play the better your reaction time gets. If I have one complaint it's that I started out surfing the Australian subway system, and all of a sudden, without warning, I'm surfing Tokyo. Why did it change? And when will it change again? Is it a goal I have to reach? No where does it explain this. Id like the scenery to change soon. I'm getting bored surfing Tokyo.
1623420148|4.0|I have to say this POV is correct and not misogynistic at all.  It's a man's view of life, especially a single man. Drew (not so fond of that name) is quick to point out his virtues and faults.  That's what makes this so good. Almost every red-blooded man thinks like this.  He may not tell you that, though, but he does!<br />He get's taken down by love and readily admits it.  He's all male and I love it!
B0079XPUOW|5.0|I laughed…I cried..Redshirts is wonderfully witty look at writing and alternate realities. I would be proud to wear a red shirt-- even only for \\"one episode.\\"
B004EPYZZ8|2.0|The dvd arrived promptly, but was scratched in places. We used it anyway, because it was for a birthday party and did not preview the movie.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|It took me 2 days to figure out if I like that book or not and on the end I decided to change my ratting from 3* to 5*. I really enjoy reading it and can ensure you that you can not predict how this story will end up.
B00CXN2JNS|5.0|The clips Amazon provides don't do this album justice. It kicks tail and the more you listen the better it gets, not many albums can do that. Having been able to hear the full album now I definitely recommend this to Megadeth fans. I think my favorite so far is Dance in the Rain. As a long time Megadeth fan since Peace Sells and KIMB I rate this 4.5 stars (can't do half stars on their system for some silly reason). Don't listen to the negative reviews, they probably haven't actually listened to the whole album.
B00B8WXG9G|2.0|Paul Anka is a singer from last century.  I do not dislike his music but I think that he is too advanced in years to add hip hop like beats and hyped up bass licks to his music.  I liked the lyrics and his choice of singing partners, however Leon Russell and Willie Nelson virtually have no voices left.  I disliked the monotonous drum beat which is prominent in rap music.  He should have had Russ Kunkel on drums to provide some terrific drum licks.  The pumped up bass almost obscures the vocals where I couldn't hear all of the lyrics, even after adjusting my iPod's equalizer.  The most enjoyable musical part of this album is Chris Botti's trumpet.  Props to him.  If Paul Anka ever does another album he needs to get a more eclectic drummer and turn down the bass.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This app is user friendly  there may be better ones but this is solid for reading and following a study plan.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I believe if more people read this book, the marriage rate would go down. I have recommended this book to all my friends, and family.
B00C33M2EE|4.0|I really enjoy the Piano Guys music and this CD lives up to their reputation.  It was great getting a DVD as well as a CD.  The humor in their music really comes out in the music videos and they are excellent.
B004SBULWE|4.0|Just got a smart phone for X-mas, battery life was horrible on it. Then someone told me a needed the app killer app because apps stay active when you go back to your home screen. So I downloaded this & it does give you a list of apps still active & will shut them down for you at least I think
B008FRFN7A|5.0|This is great!  I love that when I arrive home my document or photo is there waiting for me.  A must have in today's world.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game, while pretty much totally pointless as far as a complete it quest, will totally suck you in. It's a very good game to have on a mobile device because you can easily play it on the bus, waiting in a dr.'s office or what have you. Very rad once you get into it.
0141345659|5.0|I had seen tons of people reading this book on the subway, was recommended by friends as well. Sometimes a story just stays with you, and this will for a long time. I've never read John Green before, and man he is so talented. In theory what would seem a very depressing story line, is very thoughtful, warm, at times hilarious and deep. You'll laugh and cry on the same page. And at 24 I can say it's anything but a YA novel.
