B003X897D2|5.0|The other reviewer has said things eloquently, so I won't expand to much here. Enough to say I've been listening to this great album all morning and loving it.<br /><br />This isn't Coltrane's first record, but it is the one where he really stepped into his own style as a musical leader. Recorded just a couple weeks after he finished the sessions on Miles Davis's legendary \\"Kind of Blue\\", the album deserves its place as one of the great jazz recordings ever.<br /><br />A great MP3 Daily Deal on 6/23/2012. Highly recommended!

0545123275|4.0|Disclaimer: This may contain spoilers...so read at your own risk.<br />Shiver is told from two points of view, Grace and Sam, going back and forth between them. It is a love story of the paranormal kind. When I first started reading it , I couldn't see myself going on to read the next book,  there were just enough elements to keep me reading... and then it happened... just like that I was pulled into the story.<br />The story opens with a young girl, Grace, being attacked by wolves.  The weird thing is, she is not fighting it, she just gives into it; when one wolf comes to her and lays his muzzle in her hand and then against her cheek. She then sees his yellow eyes and she holds his gaze until he backs away. That wolf was Sam and that was when they first met and he saved Grace from the other wolves. In this way their fascination/obsession with each other begins.<br />I enjoyed the different take on Stiefvater's werewolf's and why they changed; the wolves changed with the seasons, not the moon.  When the temperature dropped with the coming of winter... that is when they changed into wolves and with the warming of spring back into human form.  However, as they get older they change into human form later  and later into the spring and summer until there comes a time when they cease to change and it is this that becomes Sam's struggle... his fight to hold on to his humanity, not only for Grace, but for himself.<br /><br />One of the things I did not like about this book was the bit with Sam making up song lyrics... that was a bit too clich&eacute; for me.<br /><br />Side Note: Contrary to others reviews, I do not see the comparison to Twilight and I read all the books.  I have found in my years that you can find similarity in all books if you look hard enough.  But I do not care what others think, I think for myself and I enjoyed reading  Shiver and I will read Linger... I need to find out what happens next.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am glad I did not read some of these reviews before I purchased the 3 books as I would have missed a great book.  I was hooked from book 1.  Fell in love with the characters.  Can't wait to see the movie.
B0007TKNII|5.0|fantastic job. the product was shipped quickly, came in original packaging and was brand new, even though listed as 'like new' I am very pleased.
0375842209|5.0|Others have said it as well as can be said, so I'll just add that I read The Book Thief several years ago and still remember the characters with fondness and detail--just one of the many tests of a good book, but a meaningful one.

B007JM4CWY|5.0|Great puzzle game, much better than Sudoku. I'd never tried this number crossword puzzle before this playing this app, but I greatly enjoy it. Play almost every day. The logic used for this kind of puzzle seems to make a lot more sense than it does for the higher leveled Sudoku puzzles.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|Great app easy to use, YES it does work without a camera from the gallery.<br />Please actually try the apps before you write a review. Comments look foolish when you are asking for a feature which is in the software. It is obvious to anyone reading some of these reviews that the author did not actually try the software, or is not very computer literate.<br />Can't find the gallery?<br />Really?<br />This ain't photoshop with hundreds of choices!<br />Very easy to use!<br />Cool software kindle fire users enjoy!
1926778103|3.0|Artbook of Darksiders is well rounded and has general amount of concept art with environments, character sketches, weapons/props, etc. It's definitely worth buying to see the sketches, especially the weapons/props section. It has no low resolution blurry images relevant in some artbooks.<br /><br />The artbook would have been rated a 4 star or higher if it wasn't for it's terrible paperback binding.  I can't even open the book and keep it open anymore without having pages start falling off. A shame since it has some really excellent artwork.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|It is a shame so many people are having issues with this app.<br />I got it as the app of the day and it works perfectly on my Kindle Fire. I have tried all the different features with some of my stock photos and everything works great.<br />Lots of great features all in one place.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Just imagine- a world of games and not one of them is Mario. (Synopsis can be found in other reviews).<br /><br />I really loved this book. I was surprised by it as well. I enjoy 80s culture quite a bit and video games as well, though I would by no means declare myself an expert on the matter. I didn't find either necessary for understanding the book, but every time I saw something I knew, it connected me a bit deeper into the novel.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Great descriptions/a very well created world<br />-Good/clear writing style (very well done First Person POV)<br />-Very engaging<br />-no real grammar errors that I saw<br />-Fantastic execution of a great idea<br />-So many well done elements (though none really overwhelmed the other)- scifi, fantasy, dystopia, evil regimes<br />-LOVED the characters, especially Aech. Good character development.<br />-no particular love for the 80s needed. Appreciated as that's all part of the clues (and to add understanding to references), but the connections are explained easily enough.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-mild profanity (not much, but it was randomly sprinkled throughout and would have been fine without it).<br />-there is a very random anti-Judeo-Christo-Gd speech at the very beginning. It was extremely off putting and didn't add anything to the volume other. Parts of the speech were fine (that explained current society), but I found no reason to begin and end the diatribe with any religious connotations at all. It is somewhat short though.<br />-The ending. *Possible Minor Spoiler* It reminded me of the endings of an 80s movie. I would've like a bit more resolution.<br /><br />All-in-all, excellent book, captivating story, believable-enough characters, well-paced action, minor cursing, highly recommend.
B007MDB71O|3.0|Nothing new, CGI was excellent but I just kept getting that 'already been done 1,000 times before' feeling throughout.<br />Yes, fun for the family but if your a Sci-Fi movie nerd looking for the next Star Wars you search continues...

1455518999|4.0|This is a fast-paced thriller, typical of Baldacci. He introduces new heroes, and it is refreshing. The good thing about this book is that it is educational, it raises unknown (to me) issues about coal mining. The disapointing thing is the bitter taste the ending left me with. Thoroughly entertaining though.
B0016OMFPW|5.0|This is one of the best albums I've bought in decades I just can't stop listening to it.  Hargrove has a real Jazz soul you can tell he's studied the masters and evolved his own sound.  His band is stellar, great group sound.  I say one day this will be one of those album mentioned when people ask I want to get into jazz what should I listen to Ear Food will be on the list.
B0086700CM|5.0|Awesome sauce! Great for long trips and provides entertainment! Upgrades make the game even AWESOMER! Overall, this is the best game on my Kindle.
B007C4ZJ3K|2.0|I was excited to see this movie from what I saw of the previews.  But when I got it I wish I had rented it first.  The plot was at best fair.  The story was slow and ill formed.  It bordered on cliche with the way it was played out.  The characters were not well established and I did not like how the female lead role was beaten more times than I can count in the film.  It made the male leads seem very cowardly. I found the movie in many parts to be boring with the ending that was simply laughable and very poorly done.  Don't buy it, rent it first and save yourself a few bucks.

B000FC2PKG|1.0|I read Lisa Gardner's \\"Perfect Husband\\" and found it to be pretty good for a writer just starting out in the writing for pay business, so I decided to try \\"Alone\\" because of the good reviews and my experience with \\"Perfect Husband\\".<br /><br />After reading 50 or 60 pages, I thought she was putting together a good story about a SWAT team cop, Bobby  Dodge, who killed a man in an act that seemed to be quite justified in a domestic violence/hostage situation, only to find that he faced career-threatening  charges in connection with the shooting.  For some reason or other, however, Ms. Gardner seemed to lose the handle on the story, allowing it to meander rather aimlessly in a soap opera sort of way.  It seemed to bog down in the psyches of several of the characters as it introduced the possibility of child abuse, Munchausen syndrome by proxy, and incest and even took a detour through the land of \\"Double Indemnity\\".  In addition, one of the villains was a pedophile who seemed to kill Ms. Gardner's multitude of characters almost as fast as she could introduce them: and all of them were adults.  D. D. Warren had what amounted to little more than a cameo role as a cop who seemed willing to grab on to each of the many, many accusations brought against her friend and fellow police officer.<br /><br /> When I finished the book, I had to think a while before I could satisfy myself that all of the sub-plots had been properly laid to rest.  In fact, not all had; but I was so happy to have it end that I didn't particularly care.<br /><br />I bought \\"Love You More\\" at the same time I bought \\"Alone\\", so I guess I'll soon have a two-out-of-three result that will help me decide whether to try another of Ms. Gardner's works.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|definitely a lot of content here for free.  some games can be hit or miss but most can be rather fun and addicting.
B004QL7K6G|1.0|I am not a prude. I watch lots of slasher movies including the first 3 from the saw franchise so I am not overly squeamish. Wanderlust however made me so nauseous that I lost my cookies in a big way. They kept describing smells....and then when the main character started talking dirty to himself in the mirror I just lost it. Might just be me but I doubt it. In the outtakes he even said he was grossing himself out. Maybe if I hadn't spent time in a commune myself back in the 70's the descriptions of the smells wouldn't have come across so vividly for me, but I wouldn't watch it again. I am curious to know if anyone else reacted like I did.

0061714372|3.0|Coming from a huge Megadeth fan who has met the band twice, this book fell somewhat short of my expectations. While I think it's a good read and a must for any Megadeth fan-Dave is laugh out loud funny in some parts-I agree with the poster below who stated that something is missing. It's not that Dave lacks candor, but I think that he is not completely honest with himself or his audience, and I think at times his views are rather self-serving. I don't get that intimate feel that I got with Brian \\"Head\\" Welch's or Duff McKagan's books (and I'm not even a big  G&R fan). I also think he spends way too much of the book discussing Metallica, as in \\"I wrote A, and B, and C,\\" although maybe he is trying to set the record straight given that there still remains so much controversy surrounding what transpired. He also has the annoying habit of putting a lot of commentary in footnotes.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|Of course I'm a Baby-Boomer who loved the Beach Boys back then. They were a Big Hit with millions-upon-millions of fans, and to see them live is an unforgettable moment in history.

They are indeed \\"Sensational!\\" There's a huge difference between Good And Fantastic. The Famous Beach Boys once again Step into the Fantastic Slot. This is Music that one can listen to over and over, without ever getting bored. The Beach Boys and their famous music are the life of the party.

I mean really its free and I love it. like I said ....... addictive.
B005LAIGQ4|5.0|Visual Effects are Stunning in this incredible, unforgettable adventure, based on a true story. It has much to ponder on, especially if you love the mysteries of the sea and animals. Acting performance is Excellent and at times, I reverted back to 'FREE WILLY.' I love and adore Refreshing movies as such that makes you Feel Good at the end. A Great moral to the story, and this is one I'd watch again and again as I do with all my Favorites. This Film aims to Please in every way. Highly Recommended!

B0060AY6FO|3.0|The excellent prologue summarizes Pride & Prejudice extremely well.<br /><br />This combination of two of my favourites:  Jane Austen and P.D. James, was unfortunately somewhat disappointing.  The storyline was very average and left me wanting a whole lot more.<br /><br />I found the pace of the first 2/3rds of the novel a bit slow, followed by a rush of new information in the last third, some of which was extraneous to the plot.<br /><br />I love Darcy and Elizabeth, but in this tale, the characters could have been just anyone.<br /><br />James does capture the era, but fell flat in creating a truly superior work of historical detective fiction.<br /><br />July 22, 2012:  Edit grammar.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|This DVD is a must if you love Phantom of the Opera!  My friends and I enjoyed it even more than the movie which we also liked. Everyone from Andrew Lloyd Webber to Sarah Brightman joined in the celebration.  You won't regret purchasing this DVD as it was very well done!

B0064JV4LU|5.0|I watched this movie while travelling between New York and Zurich, and as I am always nervous when I fly, I tried to relax - and watched one of the funniest film I have ever seen.  First of all, the acting and directing are excellent, the dialogues and scenes are over the top, and finally the fact that it is based on a true story is an inspiration for all of us who need a boost of courage and optimism.  I will watch it again, this time at home when it comes out in DVD in the USA.  Rent it, buy it, enjoy it!
B004132HZS|5.0|\\"Sherlock\\" is brilliant!  I first watched the episodes online, right before Season 2 was broadcast, so I could see the series in chronological order. I recommend others watch Season 1 first as well.  Benedict Cumberbatch is amazing as the title character and Martin Freeman is wonderful as his down-to earth friend.  \\"A Study in Pink,\\" the first episode sets up the characters and series beautifully.  \\"The Blind Banker\\" is the weakest episode but still has many lovely moments.  \\"The Great Game\\" introduces Moriarty and is a fascinating cat-and-mouse thriller; the ending of this episode is a true cliffhanger and fortunately fans don't have to wait a year for the resolution because they can just buy the Season 2 DVDs.<br /><br />The quality of the DVDs is excellent.  PBS in the US broadcast these episodes with some minutes cut out to fit their timeframe.  It was the British producers who made the cuts, not PBS.  Apparently the cuts were not crucial to the shows because I can't even tell what was missing.  Then again, I have watched the DVDs numerous times and now I only remember those versions.  Before purchasing the DVDs, I asked Amazon if they were the original uncut versions because it wasn't clear from the website description and was told they were; upon asking, I was also told that I could return them if I wasn't satisfied, even if I had already opened the boxes, but I have been more than pleased with my purchase.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I am enjoying this app. FAOTD really did an awesome job selecting this one! Love the things I can do with photos right on my phone!
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Even better than the first three episodes, Season 2, consisting of \\"A Scandal in Belgravia,\\" \\"The Hounds of Baskerville,\\" and \\"The Reichenbach Fall,\\" explores Sherlock's emerging humanity.  Lots of references to the canon is each of these episodes makes it fun for those already familiar with the source material, and will intrigue those who aren't.  Filled with witty banter, deepening relationships between Sherlock and John as well as Mycroft and Molly, Season 2 is a must-see.  If you only viewed the PBS versions, the uncut episodes available on the DVD will really enhance your appreciation of the show.  Each episode also has commentary available, which is very nice.<br /><br />Benedict Cumberbatch's and Martin Freeman's acting is superb.  They well deserve all the awards the show has won.  The ending of the third episode has generated massive commentary online and waiting until Season 3 is broadcast sometime in 2013 is torturing the fans, and Moftiss seem to be greatly enjoying that!  Fortunately, we can watch and rewatch the episodes on DVD and try to figure out what really happened.
B002MG2RG0|5.0|A great classic, and fun to watch after all these years. Scary in its day, but tame if not even funny by today's standards of horror.

B000002J1U|5.0|This is a great album, and showed a different side of Zeppelin. People like to hate on it because they wanted the next whole lot of love and think its not heavy enough.

B000HC2LI0|5.0|Best purchase I have made recently!<br />However, I have two problems with it: first, the episode listing is in a separate book apart from the folder containing the season's disks--just an inconvenience, not overcome-able; and second, this series ruins you for watching anything else.  When you immerse yourself in the West Wing world (which I did, watching the entire series over a 3 week period), especially the first 4 seasons with Sorkin's words, it's very hard to find anything to replace it when it's over.  This is an awesome world, even when Sam Seaborn leaves....<br />Practically, I like the packaging.  It doesn't fit in nicely with the rest of the dvd cases on my shelf, but it takes up less space than 7 regular dvd season cases would.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is really fun, I love it!! Its better than a lot of games because it has a wide variety of games, but just in one app. The one word I would describe it as would be FUN!!!
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|The Hunger Games was an enjoyable story, drawing heavily on a clever combination of teenage angst, \\"Survivor\\", \\"MacGyver\\" and even \\"Highlander.\\"  We cheered for Katniss, who was distinguished from the other competitors by her self-sacrifice and her skill with a bow, fighting against seemingly impossible odds.<br /><br />But as the story continues through the second and third books, we realize that Katniss is an unlikeable anti-hero.  She is revealed as a narcissistic sociopath; a trained murderer.  All of her decisions are made without thinking, and instead are based purely on emotion and instinct.<br /><br />There is nothing to enjoy in Mockingjay.  I had to force myself to finish the book, in the vain hope that some twist in the story would make it worthwhile. I suppose the author was trying to make a point, such as \\"war is bad\\", or \\"humans are bad and should be replaced by some other species\\" (a point expressed several times in the story).  Okay, fine, if that's your opinion, but it doesn't make for an enjoyable book.<br /><br />And by this third book, a critical plot device becomes laughable.  In this world several hundred years in the future, why does the powerful Capitol insist on LIVE broadcasting?  You know by the third book that every time the Capitol goes on the air, it is with a LIVE broadcast in which something goes very wrong.  Gee, if only these technologically advanced people knew about TAPE DELAY, then they could have edited their broadcasts and there would have been no rebellion.<br /><br />I should have been satisfied with the first book in the series, and not have wasted my time and money with the second and third books.
0307477479|3.0|As a series of connected short stories I thought the book worked pretty well, but as I got to closer to the end I realized that what was missing was the character development essential to the power of a novel (and maybe even a good short story).  It's just not enough to plunk characters into various time/space tableaux; it's like trying to understand a person's essence by listening to a \\"first I did this, and then I did that, etc.\\" mantra--just doesn't work. Excellent writing and certainly very creative, but in the end the book itself doesn't amount to much more than an extension of the Facebook, Twitter school of relationship building satirized/damned in the final chapter.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|I got this for two reasons : Because it's free (for now) and because I like photo editing. I expected it to be a lot like PicsArt. I don't like the idea that the POST TO FACEBOOK or POST TO TWITTER buttons are so big and the SAVE button so small. As for the people who say that the app sucks because you cant save, that's not a good enough reason to be rating it with one star. I give it 4 stars for quality and speed. It is a lot easier than PicsArt. But it just needs more frames and stickers, and different text fonts. so 4 stars. whoever says that you cant save... don't listen to them. this app is good so get it while its free.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Wont load pictures from gallery just constantly resets on my Samsung galaxy s.... Keeps going back to main screen to pick picture all over again. Unistall....
B006AZZPCM|4.0|the reason I like this downloader is because it is fully functional and it takes you to the youtube moble site witch allows you to access all search results. how ever this app does need a few bug fixes and updates. I am using this on the kindle fire and it gets the job done. I have tried all other free youtube downloaders and out of all of them I recomend this one. the only reason I have 4 stars on this other than 5 is because of bugs on the kindle fire.
034580404X|1.0|I will admit that the first of the three in the trilogy was good.  In the second the characters started to become more unrealistic and annoying.  The basic layout of the second book was they got into a fight then they had sex then they talked about how much they loved each other then there would be a little bit of the plot.  In all honestly the author could have just copied and pasted all the sex scenes and lovey dovey talks and it would be the same book.  The third book was just unbearable.  I stopped halfway through because of Christians obnoxious need to control everything she did and Ana's even more annoying need to give in on what she wanted just to make him happy.  She would be telling him how she felt only to have him seduce her mid argument. As a result he continued to be controlling and it felt as if he never respected her independence. In my opinion the book is saying that it is okay to be in a controlling relationship when the sex is good as long as he seems to be making an attempt to change.  The second and third book romanticize this unhealthy controlling relationship that this young girl is in.<br />I also do understand that this is a fantasy book, but it was more unrealistic than a cheesy horror movie on the SyFy network.  First off Christian started his company when he was either 19 or 20 (because he did complete 2 years of college) and by the age of 27 he was making about $100,000 an hour.  Not only that but he had enough time to become amazing in bed, which as most women know it takes quite some time to train most men.  Second, Ana climaxes at least once every time they have sex.  Again if it was like this and they only had sex a few times in the book, then it would be believable.  They also get married a couple of months after meeting and none of their friends or family put up a fight about this.  Everyone just asked them if they were sure this is what Christian and Ana then went on their marry ways.  Finally, there wasn't a prenup!  I don't personally know any billionaires, but I am assuming they would get prenups.<br />Bottom line, if you want to read a book with mediocre sex scenes and your fantasy is to have a man control you not only in the bedroom but in your life then this trilogy will be a good read for you. If not then the first book in the trilogy is good and I would recommend just finding a summary of the 2nd and 3rd online.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is tjebest game in the whole entire world and the cool thing about it is that u can play so many games in one app. so cool
0345803485|2.0|All of these negative reviews are sadly right...while the plot is mildly interesting and I really wanted to like the series, in reality it is just trash fiction and an abomination of literature. PLEASE don't give this terrible terrible author any more money by purchasing this sub-par series.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Have been dying for a series of books capable of transporting the reader to another place a la Harry Potter. Finally they a here!  The characters come to life in this series and you can't bear to be away from the book as you need to know what happens to them next. The essential summer read. Went through all 3 books in less than a week they are so gripping.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|it has awesome filters and extras. works great on my samsung! worth the money. i needed something with basic and fun edits
B004XXIHS2|5.0|I loved this old classic- which is timeless. Ira Levin is a wonderful storyteller.<br />Excellent writing and gripping plot kept me up all night to finish it.<br />A very satisfying read- Highly recommended.

0066620996|5.0|This is the best business book I've ever read. I've re-read it 3 times, and each time I'm energized and motivated to take the right steps to make at least the part of the business I control great.<br />People seem to want the book to be more than it is. It's about how certain companies in the past transitioned from average results to great results. They studied the transition point and what was common among companies at the transition point. The data and stories are well worth researching and emulating. To the book's detractors, is it a surprise to anyone that great companies can revert to average 15 years later? Does it invalidate the fact that they had FIFTEEN YEARS of outperformance? Is it a surprise that you can't run controlled experiments in economics and business?<br />It's a great book. Read it and you'll be inspired.
B005HSL626|3.0|I really enjoy this game.  But the ads are annoying and on arcade mode, the screen will go black.  It would be 5 stars if they fixed these problems.
0064400557|5.0|I think that it was the BEST BOOK EVER! It was so wonderful that I read it over and over again. E.B. White is a very talented author and he should always write books. My favorite characters are Fern,and Charlotte. I like them because they are very kind to Wilbur. I even made my specialest stuffed animal Wilbur. I also like the book because my name is Charlotte. I think everyone should read this book!

B007WEYGPC|5.0|I read this wonderful book in 6th grade.  Forever after, and for some unknown reason, I compared all families to the Finch Family.  (I was not from a broken home, and many of my friends were not, either.)  To me this book didn't just cover the south, it covered the potential for hope in all families.  It never occurred to me that there were people out there who had not read this book.  Some years later I was talking to Shawn and discovered he'd not had the joy.  I admit I nagged him a little about it.<br /><br />Okay.  I nagged him a lot.<br /><br />One year rolled into two, which rolled into five or more.  Every time it came up in media, or someone mentioned it, or I saw maple syrup, I mentioned it.  I'd say, \\"Have you read that book yet?\\"  And he'd say, \\"I see the syrup is on the table again.\\"  And I'd say back, \\"You'll never know how important chifferobe's are.\\"  And he'd say, \\"What's a chifferobe?  Why is it in the maple syrup?\\"  Once I told him it was a bug, a special space bug.  Another time I told him it was a type of mystical knowledge found in the leaves of a scuppernong arbor.  After a long time of this one day he tells me, \\"Did you know a chifferobe is a piece of furniture?  I looked it up online.\\"  I told him, \\"Probably named after the wonderful seat-of-the-pants sports game in To Kill a Mockingbird.\\"  And he said, \\"Oh, I should read that book, then, huh?\\"  I said: \\"Yes.\\"<br /><br />The next day Shawn bought the book.  He read three paragraphs and put it down.  This is a person who consumes massive tomes in hours.  I asked, \\"What are you doing?  Don't you like the book?\\"  And he said, \\"I like it a lot.  One doesn't waste a good read like this by pushing through it in one sitting.  One savors it.\\"  And he said, \\"It's not about space aliens, is it?  Scuppernong's aren't real either, are they?\\"  I said, \\"You'll see.\\"<br /><br />Since then he brings it up whenever it's in the media, or someone mentions it, or he sees maple syrup.

0743277708|5.0|I'm currently going down the NPR listeners' list of the Top 100 Sci-Fi and Fantasy books. Watership Down was on this list. I had the vaguest sense that this was a book a classic, but aside from that, I knew only that this was a book about rabbits.<br /><br />So, thinking I was going to have a suffer through a silly book about rabbits in their silly little rabbit holes, I settled in and began to read. All the rabbits had names like Hazel, Big Wig, Dandelion, and Fiver, but for some reason these names fit their characters, and I nodded my head and said \\"okay.\\" I mean, what use for last names would rabbits have, since they don't have driver's licenses?<br /><br />When one prophetic rabbit convinces a few others that their home is threatened by men, I said \\"oh, that silly Fiver,\\" but I found myself concerned for the poor rabbits. Even worse, I realized I was thinking about these rabbits not as delectable woodland morsels but as individuals in peril.<br /><br />About a quarter of the way into the book, I realized that that clever Richard Adams had drawn me into a world with its own mythology, history, and vocabulary, and created a work not about rabbits but about courage, perseverance, and friendship.<br /><br />I give this book five stars.<br /><br />Three cheers for myths about rabbits!
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|This is a book in need of a mystery.  One is hinted at, and then dropped, in favor of a repetitive, boring romance.  So much more could have been done with the characters.  But they were like paper dolls, getting dressed up in different outfits.  Very little action. The most interesting plot point (the missing manuscript) is simply referred to, never acted upon.  I listened to the audio version (24 hours worth!) and literally fell asleep several times.  And the end of this massive book was like a blatant sales pitch: \\"Nothing is resolved!  See what happens in volume two!\\"<br /><br />And the stereotypes!  Gee, give me a break.  Everyone's favorite aunt and least favorite prof is in there.  Way too long, way too much effort for the story.  This book cries out for a good editor - one with a blood red pen.
B004RL9T50|4.0|I enjoyed it. The movie was really cute and entertaining. Not really any boring minutes. I admit I was skeptical, but this animation told a cute story and was fun to watch. I recommend. It left me in a good mood.

B001FB0WBK|5.0|I purchased my first Tommy DVD, and it was everything I hoped for and more!  At one point, I found myself in tears as I felt the emotion from his music and grace in his playing.  What I love about Tommy is how every note is emphasized with the perfect volume and sustain.  He pays attention to detail, playing notes and sounds with grace and precision.  Sometimes a note is barely audible, but his music communicates powerfully!  I love how he knows so well how to keep the song interesting and spontaneous... he always changes things up so that your ear doesn't get tired of hearing a certain phrase.  Also his endings never end where you expect them to.  I say his audience interaction was exceptional.  Apparently certain parts b/w songs were edited out, but it didn't matter to me....  Brilliant performance!
B00338QENI|5.0|This story was so amazing!  It is a story of how one woman's cancer cells reproduced so rapidly and were used for years of clinical trials and helped save so many lives!  The story of her family and how they were left in the dark about how science was using her cells is tragic.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I had watched others play Ice Age Village and thought &quot;what's the thrill?&quot;  Once I started playing. I found out the thrill is watching the gang working with a purpose.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Very fun! It has a lot of options. And its better than several other picture applications that I've purchased. And I got it when it was free app of the day on Amazon!!!
B007W7P5L8|5.0|I bought this to go along with my [[ASIN:B0051VVOB2 Kindle Fire]] so it would have some protection as I carted it with me everywhere I went.  I also thought it would be handy when I wanted to put it on a desk since it will hold it at a handy angle for use.  I was concerned about this smell issue so I checked by holding it up and giving it a good sniff, no foul aroma.  It actually smelled like real leather rather than the pleather it is made out of in reality.  I am also a very colorful person so when I saw the nice purple color as an option I had to have it.  I will note here that the purple color shown isn't quite the purple you get.  Mine was a good deal less bright and wound up looking like more of really dark purple but in all I am still pleased.  It does have a bit of a shimmer to it in full sun so I guess that makes it better as far as the color goes for me.<br /><br />My cover holds my [[ASIN:B0051VVOB2 Kindle Fire]] tightly and securely and I had no trouble snapping it in place at all.  The cradle seems to hold it well too since I had to give it a good test by shaking it hard while holding the device downwards over my bed, in case it flew out.  It didn't move a bit nor did I find I had to push it back into place because it wound up being loose.  It passed that test with flying colors.  It really does hold the Kindle at a great angle for use and viewing when using it to tilt it on a desk too.  The elastic band holds the cover tightly shut but not so much that it makes any indentations on the screen or the [[ASIN:B005QCDY50 Screen Protector]] I have on it.  I also use the elastic band to hold my [[ASIN:B005BUXRUO Touch Screen Stylus]].  I just clip it along the bottom of the Kindle and it holds the pen//stylus up under the cover so it doesn't fall off or get damaged or lost.  Not to mention the Hot Pink color of the stylus goes great with the color of the cover.<br /><br />Overall this is a pretty nice product for such a low price and I can see it lasting as long as the Kindle does.ong as the Kindle does.
B005LAIGNC|5.0|Enjoyed the movie the first time I saw it and glad I got the video.  Definitely worth getting a copy.
0345803485|1.0|I am so relieved I didn't pay a cent for this book!<br /><br />After seeing a bunch of ads for this book all over, and being encouraged by my coworker to read it, I decided to finally give in and let her lend me her copy. I then realized this book is complete and utter crap after the very first chapter.<br /><br />Where to even begin? For starters, this book is a complete and total rip-off of Twilight. It was a Twilight fanfiction first, that I understand, but the editor did not see the glaring similarities between Bella Swan and Anastasia Steele?! Both are clumsy. Both like to read as their main hobby. Both are socially awkward lip biters who fail to see their own beauty. Both have scatterbrained, divorced mothers and father figures they call by their first names. Both work at hardware stores with a male coworker that has a crush on them (Peter/Mike). Both have a close friend of a different race (Jose/Jacob) who also has a crush on them. Both have god-esque boyfriends who are controlling and secretive. The list goes on! If I were Stephenie Meyer I would try to sue this author for blatantly ripping off my characters!<br /><br />The writing in this book is atrocious. I can't believe some people consider this to be well written. Awful descriptions, grammar, repetition, character dialogues, everything was terrible. As many other reviewers stated, Ana uses \\"holy cow\\", \\"double/triple crap\\" and \\"oh my\\" so much that I started picturing her as a feeble old grandmother, not as a young 21/22 year old woman. References to her inner goddess, etc, were awkward. Her ditsy mother's character was extremely annoying. Your daughter calls you crying late at night multiple times over a man she has just met, you show no concern, and only reply, \\"Oh, honey, don't you worry your pretty little head! Men are just complicated creatures! I love you!\\" You don't even show concern when the guy SHOWS UP at your house while your daughter is visiting, from thousands of miles away!?<br /><br />Christian is an interesting and complex character, I will give the author that much. However his background was not expolored as much as it should be. His excitement and intruige over Ana is baffling because she is so boring. She only likes him because he is hard to get and so attractive. For a grown woman Ana is pathetic, allowing herself to be treated horribly and subjected to degrading things. I am not even talking about the sex. For this type of sexual fetish some control/domineering personality and degradation is expected. I am talking about outside of the bedroom, such as when Ana allows Christian to pick her up like a toddler in the street and carry her places, say he is going to \\"take her across his knee\\" in a resteraunt because she isn't hungry and doesn't want to eat, etc. It's pathetic!<br /><br />I understand that the tile of the book is \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\", and the author has to explain at some point what exactly \\"50 shades\\" means. Once would be sufficient, but no, she continuously shoves the meaning of the title into the reader's face: calling him Fifty, Fifty Shades, etc. It was annoying! Way to not be poignant with the meaning of your title and move on.<br /><br />There are so many better authors out there, with many different genres of books, that are not getting the recognition this book has gotten, and probably never will. It makes me really sad to think about how successful and rich the author is, meanwhile other, far more talented authors are likely struggling to even get their works published in the first place.
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|this is a great app for the kindle fire. in app purchases are annoying but not needed to play. over all, GET THIS APP!!!!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|beautiful graphics, really fun!  I'm not sure what people are complaining about.  I used only one hint the whole game!  The whole idea is to use your brain and figure things out for yourself.  If you're the type to need to be spoonfed the answers, don't even bother.  I never used the map and didn't even mind navigating from place to place - to me it was part of the fun of the game.<br />Kudos to the developers, and I look forward to more from them!
B0086700CM|4.0|this is a great game. so fun and full of suspense! the monkeys  creep me out a bit, but they are only an incentive to win!!

B0029QRA1U|4.0|This turntable works great! Was having a problem getting it to work with my stereo amp, but I found out through customer service that you DO NOT connect it to the 'PHONO' input, but to any other input. Other than no manual or specifications on it, it works great. The product explanation on Amazon said that it did '78's', but it does not. But what I have transfered so far to mp3s is great. Would like the Mac software to be more developed and equal to PC.
0143034901|5.0|This is a great book. Its worth 20 times its price but beware, it will leave you wanting more!!! The vivid wording brings the book to life.

B003QSLW0K|4.0|The kids enjoyed the movie. It wasn't as good as other movies meant for young kids but it kept them quiet for an hour or so.
1466401885|4.0|My book group was looking for a similar read to Fifty Shades. This book is a lot less in the graphic department but still had the same pull and gave me the same desire to read about the relationship. I liked the story-easy to get into and hard to put down. I was amazed with all the typos-I've never read a book with so many. I also laughed when the epilogue took place the morning after the last chapter ended-isn't that just another chapter?
B0080SZ0V8|3.0|It's a fun game to pass the time with, but not really worth the money. This game doesn't even inspire me 4 twenty words,
B005LAII08|4.0|So what is there to say that hasn't been said? All the reviews for this film have nearly universally claimed that the animation is fantastic, as one would expect, and it is indeed. The scenery is gorgeous, the 3D really helps the beautiful visuals pop and provides depth, the character designs are distinctive (if not slightly reminiscent of Dreamworks How to Train Your Dragon). Any animation fan will enjoy watching this film.<br /><br />As for the film overall, the story is charming, if not also quite familiar, and there is certainly enough humor and funny sounding pronunciations (the Scottish accents are purposefully hammed up at times) to keep children engaged. One caution up front, I would advise against taking toddlers, or extremely timid children, as there is a frightening bear, seen for a much more tame moment in the previews, who has several less tame scenes scattered throughout the film. Another caution for readers of the review, I am going to strongly hint at the major plot point of the film, I won't come right out and say it but I will say that by now most will have pieced it together from previews and other reviews, so this review shouldn't spoil anyone who hasn't figured it out already.<br /><br />All this said, I usually don't write reviews to simply regurgitate what has been said already, so I do have a point here I would like to make. The difference between this film and a true transcendent classic is that this film does nothing new or truly unique (well perhaps one thing, but we'll get to that). It is excellent to see a female heroine (especially one this strong) but the very notion of putting a female up front is something that has been done purposefully before, so even that cannot be said to make this film unique. I'm sure many, especially some mothers, will adore this film and they have every right to, it is charming in many respects. A great many more people will enjoy this film moderately and put it in their collection to rewatch, but this film will never be as great or as remembered as it could have been, and as an animation/Pixar fan that leaves me somewhat disappointed.<br /><br />The previews are deliberately vague regarding the actual story of this film. The opening is clear enough, a princess doesn't want to marry and butts heads with her mother so she goes in search of a spell to change her fate... it all seems familiar but is bold in its honesty and execution. However, from there I found the film became less Brave and more like what I will call Mama Bear, somewhat of a spinoff take on Disney's Brother Bear. The film runs with this new conceit, dropping what I deemed to be the more interesting story of the princess's efforts to win her own hand and convince her mother to change tradition, but never goes anywhere with it other than the usual predictable places. Predictability isn't a bad thing, it is often comforting and in many ways is even expected from any film, let alone a family film. But as a Disney Pixar film one would have thought they'd push the boundaries here or at least have the story be incredibly well told. Ultimately, the 'Mama Bear' idea just isn't mined to its full potential, though that doesn't stop it from being fun and having laughs.<br /><br />Overall the film, which admittedly had a troubled production, feels like a pastiche of earlier efforts by Disney and even some of their rival studios. There is even a random witch character thrown into the mix but then she disappears never to return or be mentioned again. A lot of elements in the film are that way, they appear, play their part in the plot and then disappear or vanish until they may or may not be needed again. There are few strong through lines. More evidence to this is that the only villain truly presented here seems to be stubbornness (and perhaps that scary bear who waltzes in and out of the plot with little purpose), which is again a potentially interesting angle but it doesn't fully develop and things are wrapped up tooeasily in that regard without any sacrifice and surprisingly little effort. The film also seems unable to decide whether it wants to be classic fairy tale (i.e. Disney's traditional formula) or take the true Pixar/Dreamworks route and have a modern take (i.e. Toy Story, Shrek, etc.), as such much of the film feels in a definite time and place but then certain scenes have modern references thrown in.<br /><br />Now back to finding praise for the film, the stubborn characters are the princess, and her mother the queen. Both want what they want and desire for the other to see their point of view (sound familiar to any parents of adolescents?). The story does do an excellent job of portraying the trials of a mother and daughter relationship, at least from my experiences as an observer. The teenage princess really goes for the throat and the mother truly loses her control in one crucial moment and it all feels heartwrenchingly true to life. The one original thing I praise about the film is that mother-daughter relationship, but ironically at the same time it feels too realistic and thus out of place in a movie that tones everything else down. Another positive note is that neither the mother nor the daughter ultimately gives into the other but instead a wonderful scene shows how both have come to understand the other and they find a common ground, which is much better than simply having a stubborn parent realize they were wrong (you know, little mermaid style).<br /><br />I do recommend this film to animation fans, children kindergarten and up, or even for mothers and their adolescent daughters. It is well made and extremely well animated but overall as a 23 year old male film fan who adores Pixar (and Disney even more so) I have to say this film reminded me of Disney's Brother Bear, which was unfortunately only moderately successful. While I personally love that film and feel it brings together so many themes so wonderfully (the Inuit culture, man vs. nature, family bonds, beautiful and unique settings) this film takes the conceit from that film and never plays it out as well as it could or with the originality one comes to expect from Pixar. Even a straight A student gets a B once and a while, I just wish this film had been as strong willed as its main character, picked one direction and been more... well, Brave.<br /><br />Still highly recommended, with less gags but definitely more depth than Madagascar 3, but far from a must see for the casual filmgoer.

B002NUULNG|4.0|From what I can tell about this product, I was a little confused. I thought wtf does 2.0 mean? Is it a remastered addition with extra scenes or extra behind the scenes? Or is it an entirely different movie?<br /><br />Well its the Ghost in a Shell original movie. It has nothing the original dvd version didn't have. Why does it say 2.0? I guess because its remastered for blu ray version? I really didn't see any differences from the dvd version to this version, other then that it plays on a blu ray player and not a dvd player.<br /><br />Even the one behind the scenes option, was something the original dvd version had included previously and nothing new. But if u want the movie in the blu ray option, I supposed this is the way to go. I just wish they didnt try to confuse people by adding the 2.0 to the title, making u think it might be some other movie, maybe even the ghost in a shell 2 movie that DOES exist, which this is not.<br /><br />So in the end, its the ghost in a shell movie (first one), with only ONE behind the scene option (which was with the original dvd version previously), and a blu ray option. Thats all. Nothing else.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|I was a bit wary on some of the actors that were singing in this movie.  But Tom Cruise reeeeaaaally impressed me.  I havent loved him since Top Gun and A Few Good Men.  He is now back in my heart and looks great for an almost 50 yr old (birthday in a couple weeks). Oops, sorry this isnt a movie review.  Although I think JulianneH sounds like a chipmunk, she did well singing with others.  Diego Boneta (where did he come from?)  He is awesome!  Even Adam Baldwin and Russell Brand sounded great.  I knew MalinA and CatherineZ would already do well.  They all made me want to go out and get this CD.  And I am.  :-)  I wish the director of Mamma Mia actually put in some time and money for vocal coaches.  Definietely buy this CD and ROCK!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Its fun but a little bit slow. Also unlocking the games is a hassle when you get further along. But its a good time killer.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|This is one of those movies that gets better on repeat viewings.. The first time I saw this movie I thought, \\"Not bad, your standard rock em sock em action movie you see every day.\\" Then the 2nd time I saw it I was like, \\"Ok this movie is amazing.\\"<br />  This movie has wonderful set pieces, the use of color/ the dark themed overtones and choreography are top of the class.. If you thirsten for chain to the balls action, look no further this movie cost less than a Million and it packs a wallop of a punch.. This is an Indonesian film and the art form used in this movie is call, \\"Silat\\" it's deadly and looks like a combination of Muay Thai and John Wayne's Whiskey red neck punch, lol... GO SEE THIS BAD ASS FLICK NOW, BEST FILM OF 2012 for me!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I HATE to read and havent read a book in YEARS! the girls at work were talking about this book so i decided to give it a go. Best racey romance ever!!!! You will be hooked
B007U1FEJE|5.0|No matter how well this album is being received right now, it is my opinion that it is still underrated. I cannot stress enough how vital this band is on their 50th Anniversary tour. Saw them in concert at the Hollywood Bowl and it was thrilling. The songs from this album stood up nicely to the old classics. They join the ranks of hardly ANYONE their age (70's) who are still making great music. Thanks guys, just for still being here, but for continuing to add to an every growing legacy.

B006TZBGBW|4.0|The Good:<br /><br />1. All the Halford era Judas Priest studio albums plus three live albums in one easy to store box set. AWESOME!<br />2. The discs themselves all have album cover art printed on them (some box sets skimp in this area.)<br />3. The price is very reasonable for how much great music is offered here.<br />4. Mini (and I mean mini) lp cardboard sleeves are cool, but read on.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />1. The discs fit so tightly in their cardboard sleeves, it's a hassle to get them out, and they are likely to get scuffs and scratches just from rubbing against the cardboard. You have to either flex the cardboard sleeve quite hard or pull on the discs' top and bottom with your finger tips. Not good for music fans who want to keep their discs and packaging mint. The discs are especially tight fitting in the two double albums with gatefold sleeves. My copy of Preist, Live! was scratched the first time I wrestled it out of its sleeve. Frustrating!<br /><br />That's really my only complaint about this otherwise cool box set. Sure, the box itself could be higher quality cardboard with two pieces that slide together, but for the price this box that folds together is just fine with me. I think the idea was to keep the price affordable for this set, so the packaging isn't nearly as deluxe as japanese-made box sets (The Beatles in Mono, Led Zeppelin Definitive Collection, etc.) Even though I like the \\"Ripper\\" sung albums, I think they made the right call not including them in this set (if they even had the choice). I'll be storing my CDs in separate cases to keep them protected and easier to access, but I'm happy to have a mostly complete Priest collection with one purchase.
B007H9B6KA|5.0|I really missed listening to a Garbage album during these 7 years that passed by since \\"Bleed like me\\" (2005). I was really afraid that I could find this record a \\"dissapointment\\" since they had been away from us as fans aas well as from each other as bandmates. So, this been said I started wondering if they would be able to find their sound again and if they would be able to transmit it as well as they always did in their previous albums. Then, when I first listened to \\"Blood for poppies\\" I knew right away that they had achieved my expectations with honors!<br /><br />This is the exact same record I had in mind after their last release. Something that I must point out is that this album has an \\"industrial\\" direction established eventhough it is still a pop album by Garbage. If you really pay attention to \\"Automatic systematic habit\\", \\"Control\\" and \\"I hate love\\" you'll listen to Garbage sounds here and there but also, you'll notice that Nine inch nails could've set some layers for these songs as well. \\"Blood for poppies\\" is by far one of my favorite songs in the album and a great 1st single indeed... really a la Garbage. Now, \\"Battle in me\\" is the finest proof that Butch Vig is part of this album as well because this song is so attached to the \\"alternative\\" side of the band as well as influenced by memories of Vig's producer's days when he worked with Kurt Cobain and Nirvana. \\"Big, bright world\\", \\"Not your kind of people\\" (one great tune indeed), \\"Man on a wire\\" and \\"Beloved freak\\" are close to the structure and sounds that Garbage built up in \\"Garbage\\" (1995) \\"Version 2.0\\" (1998) and \\"Beautiful garbage\\" (2001).<br /><br />They are not tired at all and they are happy to had released another album as well. These are statement you can read and understand when you listen to the whole album. Once I said, back in 1998 I guess that Garbage was about to released an album that would be their masterpiece just a la Depeche Mode. Well, \\"Not your kind of people\\" is not exactly \\"that\\" album but with it the band is getting closer and closer for sure. BTW, Shirley Manson's voice is still hot just because she is THE HOTTEST singer ever!!!.... love her:)\\"that\\" album but with it the band is getting closer and closer for sure. BTW, Shirley Manson's voice is still hot just because she is THE HOTTEST singer ever!!!.... love her:)
B0059XTUVI|3.0|Released December 30, 2011. Widescreen. Running Time: 1 hour, 44 mins.<br />  The movie begins with Margaret Thatcher (Meryl Streep), in her life of retirement, is purchasing a pint of milk in a market and is surprised by the price of it. At home, she speaks with her husband Denis (Jim Broadbent) during breakfast, however, her husband passed away in 2003. She misses her husband so much, it gives her comfort to believe he is still there in her home. It's a way of trying to keep memories. The staff sees her talking to herself.<br /> That night, she dresses up beautiful and entertains guests for dinner keeping up her character and staying in good spirits.<br />  Her daughter reminds her at bedtime that she is no longer the Prime Minister, Mark is in South Africa and her husband is dead. Margaret responds to her daughter, \\"You look exhausted, dear\\".<br /><br />  Margaret Thatcher was the longest serving Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (1979-90) of 11 years and 209 days and the first female Prime Minister.<br /><br /> I thought the movie was a bit disrespectful to Margaret Thatcher and I did not like the storyline jumping back and forth to the present and the past so much.<br /><br /> Meryl Streep won the Academy Award for Best Performance by an Actress. Best Achievement in Make-Up given to Mark Coulier and J. Roy Helland.<br /> BAFTA Award to Meryl Streep and Best Make-Up and Hair to J. Roy Helland, Marese Langan, Mark Coulier.<br /><br /> Movie is in English. Option of subtitles in English and Spanish.<br /><br /> Special Features: 6 featurettes.<br /><br /> If you see the James Bond movie, [[ASIN:B001AQMBIC For Your Eyes Only [Blu-ray]]], you will see Janet Brown convincingly play \\"Margaret Thatcher\\" and John Wells as \\"Denis Thatcher\\".<br /> Janet Brown died May 27, 2011 at the age of 87.<br /><br /> Baroness Margaret Thatcher passed away following a stroke, April 8, 2013, at the age of 87.
B007P6VLRS|5.0|Five years have gone since the released of \\"Zeitgeist\\", an album that was a MAJOR dissapointment when we found in it that Corgan and \\"those\\" Pumpkins were not connected at all in that record. But with \\"Oceania\\" I must say that \\"these\\" Pumpkins have taken back what they had lost in the last record.<br /><br />This version of the Smashing Pumpkins is by far closer to what once was with Iha, Chamberlin and D'Arcy and, eventhough they don't really reach that level of greatness with \\"Oceania\\", they find themselves in a place where they can be musically in order to communicate their best intentions in these songs. Songs like \\"Quasar\\", \\"Panopticon\\" and \\"The Chimera\\" are the closest thing you'll hear from the Smashing Pumpkins to what they did in \\"Siamese dream\\" (1993) or even \\"Gish\\" (1991). And songs like \\"The Celestials\\" (magnificent song of BC), \\"Pale horse\\" and \\"Pinwheels\\" are more related with something you heard before in \\"Adore\\" (1998) or \\"Machina...\\" (2000). Now, I must point out that a couple of songs really caught my attention for a particular reason... \\"Love is winter\\" and \\"One diamond, one heart\\" seem to be influenced by The Cure's sound from records like \\"The head on the door\\" (The Cure, 1985) or even the \\"Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me\\" album (The Cure, 1987). This is not a surprise to me at all since Billy Corgan has always admited how much he loves The Cure. Great couple of songs indeed. Just check the keyboards arrangements and you'll see why I'm saying this.<br /><br />Now, \\"Zwan\\" was a projet that I loved from Corgan as well. But I kind of knew that this band was not going to last since he had in mind to keep on going with the \\"Smashing Pumpkins\\" name and its essence as well. But, if you ask me, this record could've been the 2nd from Zwan \\"in a way\\" (not considering all the songs in it of course... there's more of the Pumpkins in here than Zwan).<br /><br />This record sounds great and you'll love it if you were a Pumpkins fans from \\"Gish\\" to \\"Machina...\\" (\\"Zeitgeist\\" was meant to be a forgotten album sadly).itgeist\\" was meant to be a forgotten album sadly).

B0051MKNV8|5.0|Who doesn't want to be Albert Einstein or make over $2 million in the stock market as a day-trader - right after taking an experimental drug? This exciting fantasy tells of a man who was down and out on luck, until his brother-in-law (?) gives him an experimental drug that claims to boost one's brain power. Just when the daring experimenter starts to ride the waves to instant intellectual powers, stardom, popularity and riches, he discovers that unwanted attention comes alongside the road to fame and riches. Is the thrilling ride worth all the risks?
B005CMSDLE|2.0|This movie had some promise but just failed to deliver on most accounts. The movie has too many characters who just come and go, are never developed, and add nothing to the movie; competent but otherwise not especially stellar fight scenes (despite being choreographed by Jeff Imada, who is certainly skilled in this area and from whom I would have expected more); and implausible plot elements that require far too much suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />The central character, a genetically enhanced teenage super-killer hit girl who's being hunted down by the CIA and the Germans, was at least novel but ultimately not very believable as she proceeds to beat the bejesus out of dozens of male agents  twice her size and weight. The movie tries to hype up the weirdness factor in an almost surrealistic and semi-poetic way (one of the few things in the movie that almost works) but it's not enough to save the movie either. The one high point was the hauntingly beautiful musical score which unfortunately is largely wasted on this movie.

1594744769|5.0|At first I thought this book was going to very scary and suspenseful, but it was full of imagination about another world, it was beautiful written and really keeps you on edge and guessing. I'm so happy with my purchase and cannot WAIT for the next one!
B001E45XT4|5.0|Great Headset but UNDERSTAND what you are purchasing!<br /><br />Rated 5 stars<br /><br />I have been using flight simulators for years in both my professional and personal life.  This review is based solely on personal use and NOT professional use.<br /><br />First off, Amazon has not failed me yet in delivering me products on time...EVERY time!<br /><br />On the headset....<br /><br />Great headset for the money.  I have used MANY headsets including converting a few sets of old David Clark headsets with Oregon Aero kits to my online sim flying games.  I am a HUGE fan of the \\"ole standard\\" of the mic/headset jacks as I do NOT want to take away from USB ports or USB headset code running in the background.<br /><br />A few things that might be a bit unclear from the pics.  The earpieces are BIG....not bulging out from each ear but are wide and tall if that makes sense.  They are very comfortable but if one is in a hot room, they can become a tad bit uncomfortable from the added heat of having your ears covered.  The comfort factor aside from heat is great!  Adjustable for LONG heads and SHORT ones.  The feel around the ears is great with the fabric and to be honest they are now a headset I use when just listening to music/videos when the speakers need to be turned off.<br /><br />Mic is solid.  My only two \\"complaints\\" would be that it takes a bit to get used to.  I am used to boom mics that come up to my lips.  This one does not and wasn't designed that way.  However, it functions perfectly in online gaming and Skype applications.  The mic tucks into the headset but MUST be shortened (aka...pushed in all the way towards the earpiece) to successfully tuck it into it's holder in the top portion.  Not an issue but something I had to get used to when storing it.  Took about two times to figure it out.<br /><br />Sound quality is great....I love good sound...this provides it.  Remember this is NOT an audiophile headset but sounds a WHOLE lot better than earbuds or otherheadsets I have used.<br /><br />Controls on the volume device located on the cord.  Hmmmm... personal preference.  This has a circular depressed knob that works fine.  For those that are used to a vertical recessed knob (like on an old AM radio) this will take a few seconds to get used to but once you have, it is very functional.<br /><br />Overall, I love this headset.  Price point was spot on!<br /><br />I would highly recommend this to any gamer/flight sim enthusiast that is looking for a non USB headset/mic combo.

0142420891|5.0|Literally 5 minutes after finishing 'If I Stay\\" I rushed over to my local bookstore and picked up a copy of this book. Admittedly when I bought it I didn't read the synopsis and therefore wasn't aware that this book was told in Adam's POV therefore for a few chapters I was a bit thrown, but quickly adjusted to his voice. I found Adam's voice to be so raw, real, genuine, and a bajillion other adjectives of that nature. I had chills the entire time while reading this book due to him and his honestly.<br /><br />While I did have a bit of difficulty connecting to Mia in this book, as I had in \\"If I Stay\\", feeling that she wasn't quite a developed as I would have liked, I did have a bit of an easier time in this book which I think can be attributed to Adam's perspective of her. Furthermore, the secondary characters of this series made more of an impact on me in this book than they had in \\"If I Stay\\"- from Liz to Kim to beyond.<br /><br />That being said, while in \\"If I Stay\\" I really enjoyed the flashbacks as it allowed us to garner a better insight of Mia and Adam's relationship, I found myself growing increasingly frustrated with them in this book- I wanted to know what was happening with Mia and Adam in the here-and-now and not Mia and Adam of the past (similarly to how I felt in Laini Taylor's \\"Daughter of Smoke and Bone\\" with Akiva and Karou's relationship). However, I felt that the song lyrics which preceded some of the chapters more than made up for the iffy flashbacks and brought a certain je ne sais quoi to the book. A few of my favourites included:<br /><br />  \\"I'll be your mess, you be mine<br />  That was the deal that we had signed<br />  I bought a hazmat suit to clean up your waste<br />  Gas masks, gloves, to keep us safe<br />  But now I'm alone in an empty room<br />  Staring down immaculate doom\\" (\\"Messy\\" Collateral Damage, Track 2, pg. 68).<br /><br />  \\"Someone wake me when it's over<br />  When the evening silence softens golden<br />  Just lay me on a bed of clover<br />  Oh, I need help with this burden\\" (\\"Hush\\" Collateral Damage, pg. 217).<br /><br />All in all, I am so glad that I decided to continue on with this series, despite only feeling \\"so-so\\" about \\"If I Stay\\"- it becomes evident that Gayle has grown tremendously as an author between the two books. This book is better in every way than its predecessor- again, I was able to devour this book in a matter of hours (actually, I managed to read both books in one day). I would highly recommend this book to everyone and I cannot wait to see what Gayle has in store for us next!on a bed of clover<br />  Oh, I need help with this burden\\" (\\"Hush\\" Collateral Damage, pg. 217).<br /><br />All in all, I am so glad that I decided to continue on with this series, despite only feeling \\"so-so\\" about \\"If I Stay\\"- it becomes evident that Gayle has grown tremendously as an author between the two books.

014241543X|4.0|I think that this book possesses one of the most well done flashback sequences I have ever read before- they were seamlessly interwoven with the present day story. The flashbacks actually brought something to the story rather than just being there for the sake of being there- They allowed us to have a deeper understanding of Mia and Adam's relationship (their feelings for one another, all of the various situations that they have undergone, etc.).<br /><br />Furthermore, I really enjoyed that the plot didn't go in the typical Plot Point A> Plot Point B> Plot Point C> Plot Point D fashion, rather the plot was a bit more unexpected, going in a rather unconventional route, with Plot Point A> Plot Point C> Plot Point D> Plot Point B- I like when authors shake it up like Gayle did with this book.<br /><br />That being said, while I did enjoy some aspects of the book, I didn't enjoy it overall quite as much as I had hoped to. After hearing so many good things about it for years I had fairly high expectations and unfortunately it didn't quite live up to said expectations. One reason that I believe so is that I didn't find Mia's voice to be as developed as I had hoped it would be, at times it felt flat to me and I had a difficult time connecting to her as a person.<br /><br />Furthermore, there were some scenes that I found to be too overly cheesy/ clique- for instance when Mia and Adam were \\"playing\\" one another's bodies as instruments (this scene *almost* rivaled the cheesiness of the \\"Twilight\\" films IMO- had this been a film I would have had a blanket over my head during this scene to have shielded me from the awkwardness). Additionally, I didn't find the story line to be all that original, I have read countless other books where one character has an out-of-body experience (or is a ghost) and follows their loved ones during a difficult time and when they awake they have a totally different outlook on life, become a better person, or something along those lines.<br /><br />All in all, despite my complaints literally 5 minutes after finishing this book I ran out to my local bookstore and picked up the second book in the series, \\"Where She Went\\" (I NEEDED to know what happened between Adam and Mia after she woke up). This is a quick read, once you start reading it you will have a difficult time putting it down (I know that I couldn't, I had this book devoured within a couple of hours of starting it). Furthermore, this book is the epitome of an emotional roller coaster- I am not ashamed to say that I teared up numerous times while reading this book. I highly recommend it to fans of YA contemporaries, especially books written by the likes of Laurlene McDaniel and Stephanie Perkins!/>All in all, despite my complaints literally 5 minutes after finishing this book I ran out to my local bookstore and picked up the second book in the series, \\"Where She Went\\" (I NEEDED to know what happened between Adam and Mia after she woke up).

B006Z7Z3S6|3.0|***This review contains spoilers***<br /><br />This movie has a good concept but a few issues stunted the potential. On the positive notes, a) I really liked the hotel setting, b)the concept of two youngish (Pat Healy is ~40) people having run of an old hotel in its last days for a ghost hunting project is awesome and something I'd love to do, c) acting is decent, and d) while clearly not entirely successful, the movie *tries* to avoid many horror movie cliches.<br /><br />On to the bad...<br /><br />Arguably the biggest problem was the character Luke -- in fact, in a  loathsome way, he's kind of thrust upon us as the real star of the show by virtue of his despicable and unfortunately enduring (not! endearing) personality.  There's technically only 2 key characters, Luke and Claire, and the Luke half is completely unlikeable.  It's clear Luke's character was intended to be snarky and endear little sympathy, but typically, we as an audience are satisfied to see that kind of character either get killed off or redeem himself at the end.  Unfortunately, neither happens with Luke in this film, as he's not only the last man standing of the two key characters, but his unlikeable personality traits endure till the very end.  Early on in the film, most of us were probably calling BS on Luke's account of seeing the ghost, but somehow not able to remember any details, so it was no surprise when later on after running away that he finally admitted to Claire he made it all up.  The guy is a jerk, a coward, and a liar.  And at the end of this movie, we have two people dead, one of which is clearly a suicide and the other clearly...? Ok, we are first led to believe Claire died purely as a result of being pursued by the corpse of the dead man and the ghost of Madeline.  Personally, I was thinking the police should have started looking at Luke as the primary suspect, because after all, how was he going to explain that ghosts were responsible?  Well, the movie has the answer -- she dropped her asthma inhaler and not having that to prevent an attack is what did her in.  That was pretty weak.<br /><br />Another issue is that the movie was good at staying just interesting enough to keep me tagging along in hopes of being rewarded with some great scare scenes and finding out what the real story behind the supposed ghosts are, however, the movie ultimately drags things out too long for a disappointing payoff.  And for all that time spent with very little happening, we never get to understand what the deal is with the 3 spirits that are supposed to be there and why the ghost of Madeline, and eventually the corpse of the old man, were malevolent toward Claire.  Was it due to anger and bitterness held over from the trauma and heartbreak from when they were alive?  Was it because the other spirits, who have no backstory, were evil and either forcing the other spirits to carry out bad deeds or perhaps masquerading as those otherwise benign entities?  We never find out and these aren't the kind of \\"good\\" questions to have at the end of a movie.  Don't get me wrong though, most of my favorite horror movies are of the \\"less is more\\" type and a slow build-up is great -- when done well.<br /><br />And then there was the mother and her son staying at the hotel briefly.  What was their purpose in the context of this film?  Did they need one?  The answer is no, but I would have liked the inclusion of these characters to have been utilized in a way that had some kind of impact on the major plot of the story.  For example, they could have either been focused on in a way as to be a red herring in the plot development of what was going on in the house (and they were not), or, the movie could have found a way to circle back to them toward the end, showing them as more key to the story then we were led to originally believe (and this did not happen).<br /><br />I think there's a good reason that this movie has no better than a 3-star average in the reviews here and that's where my rating is being placed as well.  Despite the issues I found with the movie and my \\"I would have done it this way\\" comments, I have to circle back to my notes on the positives of this movie as reasons enough to go as high as 3 stars and the fact that, in spite of it all, I'd recommend others give this movie a shot and come to their own conclusions -- I'd love to hear them.
B005LAIGN2|2.0|I looked forward to seeing this film. I was disappointed because it did not depict the real history of the Tuskegee airmen in World War II. Instead it is a fictionalized account that is about as accurate to the Tuskegee airmen as MASH was to army field hospitals in the Korean war.<br /><br />It is rife with technical inaccuracies including unbelievably advanced radios on their planes, high explosive machine gun ammunition, cameras on their planes to record their kills and cavalier, free style military tactics that would have resulted in court martials in real life.
B005LAIIRQ|5.0|Great action, suspense, and a solid performance from Liam Neeson. Go in knowing that it's something different and a film that'll make you think. Ignore the recent hate!
B000ICLRIE|5.0|This is one of Ridley Scott's best films, and one of my all-time favorite movies. The photography in this film is just gorgeous, the score is one you'll hear in your head for days, and the story really takes you in. Buy it.

B0011N1WE8|5.0|\\"Penelope\\" disproves the reigning Hollywood wisdom that bigger is better in fantasy films.  It offers what the big boys who routinely throw $200,000,000 into their projects cannot-a heart.  The film is in equal measures Hans Christian Anderson, Walt Disney and Tim Burton with its own askewed sensibility.  The primary message of the film is that beauty is in the eye of the beholder and skin deep so love the skin your in.  It's a message that resonates throughout and the makers of \\"Penelope\\" do not make it cynically.  Christina Ricci beautifully projects Penelope's fragility which makes the character more alluring despite sporting a snout for a nose.  Catherine O'Hara is a joy as her overprotective mother.  Reese Witherspoon, who produced the film, has a bit as Penelope's best friend.  Russell Brand has a smallish part as James McAvoy's associate.  I recommend this wholeheartedly as not only a great family film but a great film in a league with \\"Babe\\", another film featuring a hero with a porcine nose.  Parents may want to be warned that there are some mild innuendo on display as well as incidental scenes of drinking and smoking.
B0079J28NW|3.0|First, let me say I am a huge Beatle fan. I loved their first two movies. I am also a bigger fan of the 1962-1966 early to mid sixties Beatlemania era. To the Film. The quality is amazing. I have a 1080p screen. There is no way it could have been better. However, It is so bizarre and difficult to watch. I guess I don't appreciate the whole drugs and psychedelic thing. It just seems a product of mind that has already shown signs of deterioration form drug use.<br /><br />My mother tells me back in the sixties she took me to the movies. There was a double feature: Hansel and Gretel and Yellow submarine. She got a serious headache and walked us out. Glad I saw it and own it but, wow....?

0307352145|5.0|Teachers and parents need to read this book before engaging in a program to \\"fix\\" a quiet, shy or sensitive child.  Adults who have been criticized from childhood for not being social enough or aggressive enough will finally find in Susan Cain somebody who understands and affirms their temperament.  Cain is both an introvert and a passionate advocate for the quiet souls in American schools and businesses.  She includes stories of real introverts, past and present, so readers can learn from their struggles and achievements.<br /><br />Eleven well-researched chapters (50 pages of end notes) discuss the biology and psychology of temperament, offer practical advice for both introverts and extroverts about communicating with one another, and point out cultural differences (e.g. Asians value introverts while Americans marginalize them.) If this were not enough, Quiet also gives practical advice for structuring offices and classrooms so that introverted workers and students can think and create without being intimidated or overwhelmed. If you have been the victim of an open office floor plan or a \\"collaborative learning\\" classroom, Cain feels your pain!<br /><br />I appreciate finally finding someone who does not consider introversion a disorder to be \\"cured\\" but an alternate, equally valid way of thinking and working.  Susan Cain understands how I could once pretend to love the loud, back-slapping atmosphere of a consulting environment while inwardly wishing I could just go work in my office with the door closed--forever!  She even includes a chapter about introverts and church.  I learned I'm not the only one who doesn't want to go to women's conferences where I have to play games, spill my guts to the whole class or engage in \\"team-building exercises.\\"  Should I be considered less spiritual if I prefer just a few close friends or would rather work in the kitchen or library than teach a large group?<br /><br />My one slight irritation was her use of Al Gore as one of her examples.  Yes, use him as an example of an introvert; however I don't think his inconvenient \\"truth\\" deserved two pages in this excellent book (especially since Susan Cain's positions are backed by more credible, non-politically-motivated research than Gore's.)  Otherwise her stories are winsome and cover a variety of cultures and lifestyles: immigrants, politicians, business leaders, lawyers and little children.  Her story at the end of the book about her grandfather was especially touching.  He was an introvert and a greatly loved rabbi.  I know I would have love him, too!<br /><br />I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review.examples.

B0061S0A64|5.0|I really enjoy this app.  The music that you can create is rather soothing, not to mention it's fun.  There are no notes to read or fingerings to learn.  The best part is that my twins (almost 4) love this.  It's easy to use and there is no right or wrong way to create your music.
B00005S6K8|5.0|Our family has owned this movie for a number of years; this review is my honest opinion.<br /><br />This remake of the old movie Sabrina is every bit as good as the original. Harrison Ford plays the sexy lead to perfection and I loved what he did with the champagne flutes in his brother's pockets. We have watched this moving many times and enjoy it each one.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This Bible is pretty awesome.  You can pick whatever version or 2 or more you want, also has devotions and reading though the Bible plans. It even can be set to remind you to read. I have been very happy with it. The only thing I wish was that you just move down the page and you don't flip the pages like a regular Bible.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I could not read these books fast enough! Without a doubt the best story I have read in quite some time.  I cant wait for the next volume, WHAT IS TAKING SO LONG!!  (I need to drink less coffee)<br /><br />Edit:  I found the next part, its called \\"First Shift\\".  gotta go!
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I have tons of fun with this game.  The limited pencil size and the time it takes to gain new colors can be a bother, but both of those also add to the fun of the game.  When you only have a few colors at the beginning you can be forced to improvise, creating some unique sketches!  The ability to play with friends via the in game username (nice when one of you doesn't use Facebook, for example) is appreciated.  Random matches have mostly gone well for me as well.<br /><br />It is possible to get more colors.  Every time you correctly guess a sketch, or someone guesses yours, you and the other person are rewarded with coins.  Save up enough of these and you can get another color set.<br /><br />My first complaint is that there doesn't seem to be any way to get new words unless you get the paid (add free) version.  Sure, you can reset (with your limited bomb supply, don't waste these too freely!) the three words from which you get to choose one each round, but you can't add more words to the pool these are drawn from without getting the paid version.  Of course, there's nothing stopping you from trying a different approach to the same word.<br /><br />My other complaint is that a lot of the words are pop culture related.  If you don't follow pop culture or the person you're playing with doesn't that means you effectively end up with fewer words to chose from some rounds.<br /><br />Despite the couple of problems I have with the game I am very glad a friend convinced me to try it.  It's a lot of fun and can be played for just a few minutes, or for a longer period of time.  Really, it's a great app!

B0013O123Q|1.0|Long periods between scenes is boring.  I wanted to scream.<br /><br />Violent boring movie without a plot.  More violence than love making.  On a scale of 1 to 10, I would give this movie a -5.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and don't order this movie.  It is different from the trailer.<br /><br />Yuick that is yuck and ick at the same time.
0345803485|3.0|These books are nothing more than vamped-up romance novels, and poorly written, but oh such delicious, titillating fun to read!  I still can't figure out how to look at someone through my eyelashes (as the protagonist does frequently), but that's OK.  I have been an American for 65 years now, but I've never worn a \\"nightdress\\" or referred to \\"My sex\\" the way Ana, an allegedly bright, educated young American person, does.  And she was overwhelmed by a Mac and an I phone!  Did she go to \\"Hidden Under a Rock U\\"?  The author clearly did little research into American colloquialisms with the things the characters said/described.  The B&D is really quite mild, and the SM is virtually non-existent, except by reference.  Anyone looking for real kink will be sadly disappointed. Her sudden sexual expertise so soon after being a virgin is quite a stretch.....<br /><br />I must say that by book three, this reader is more than ready to return to some decent reading, but since I've been reading some very boring proposals for a big job at work, these books have been an interesting diversion.  Maybe if our proposing consultants would intersperse some of the juicier parts of these books into their proposals, they'd be easier to read!
B0052VUNHC|4.0|Fun, frustrating and fast storyline.  The characters are insane, but it makes for a good read.  I had to search for more from this author after I read this.

076115678X|5.0|I was a child of the 60's and all the popular girls at school had long straight shiny hair.  Mine frizzed and curled no matter what I did, soup can rollers or not. Before my senior year I used a salon straightener, and went back as a senior with long straight hair that took hours to get that way.  I refused dates to the pool or beach, didn't want anyone to see the frizz or curl that happened when it got wet.  When I was small I remember my mother brushing the curls and getting frizz. At 7 she cut them off to make it more manageable, but then I had short unmanageable hair.<br /><br />I have spent most of my life disliking my curls, and the way they managed me.  The only way I could control them was with a lot of products and flat irons, hot rollers, round brushes, until it rained or got humid.  I kept it short as I got older to make it easier.<br /><br />Finally I went to a salon that specializes in curly hair.  I found I had been doing everything wrong.  I am now growing it out and using the Deva products every time I shampoo, and find I like the spray for in between shampoos as well to reinvigorate the curls.  My hair is so much healthier, and I am learning to like it finally.  I am now 61.  I have stopped fighting the curl.<br /><br />The humidity where I live is bad in the summer.  After spending the day in it yesterday my hair looks better than ever, shiny, healthy, and bouncy.<br /><br />I disagree with the reviewer who said it makes the hair greasy. Most of us with curly hair have dry hair and need the moisture in it.  You don't need suds to clean your hair.  I am a believer.
B0086700CM|5.0|very fun game. challengin, and amusing. makes dying fun. my 8 year old daughter and I can not get enough of it.
B007OXWWX4|3.0|Slash is still master of hard rock grooves and slinky soloing.  Miles Kennedy actually sounds like an Axl Rose with a better voice, which is perhaps the one thing I was disappointed by on it.  I'd have preferred a little less of a G&R resemblance, but perhaps that's just the way Kennedy sounds.  I didn't remember him sounding so much that way on the last album, but that album was only partially sung by him.<br /><br />Once I listened past the Axl-isms and just listened to the music for what it was, I appreciated it more.  It really is a solid album.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this calculator because has oversized keypad. It's very easy to use and great for quick calulations at the store to figure out my discounts.  It loads staight to keypad,  not to a cover screen or menus first, which is annoying with some other apps.  Has other important calulating functions too besides.  Great!
0062059882|4.0|I'm a big fan of Neil Gaiman. I go into him when he wrote the Sandman comics. I decided to also start reading some of his novels. My favorite is [[ASIN:0060557818 Neverwhere: A Novel]], but American Gods and its sequel [[ASIN:0060515198 Anansi Boys]] is very good. Admittedly American Gods gets a little dry towards the middle, but it is definately worth reading.
B007PBKG5G|5.0|Love, love, love \\"You ain't alone\\".<br /><br />I read another reviewer who compared Brittany to Janis Joplin.  That's an apt comparison, except I think Brittany is more powerful and honest.  Listening to the Alabama Shakes feels personal and authentic, mournful and beautiful.  I would really like to see them live.
B001IF277K|5.0|It's a battery. You charge it up, and it powers the device. When it gets low, just charge it up again.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|This is a very nice cover for my new Kindle Fire. I love that it fits securely in the cover and that the cover bends very easily to prop up the fire for viewing movies or tv shows. I only gave this 4 stars because the only way to close the cover is an elastic strap. If I were to take my K.Fire on vacation I think I would be more likely to look for a more secure way to take it on my travels though. I have a Marware Jurni case for my regular kindle and I love it. I take that to work with me so I can read at lunch. I think this case is perfect for home use of my Kindle Fire and have no regrets in buying it. I got a purple one and the color is very nice. This folio looks like leather and so far has been wearing well. I love using my Fire and so this gets opened and closed a lot. No problems with the Fire falling out as the clips are very secure. Also the instructions for this are extremely easy to read and use.
B0037KMHRY|3.0|I'm a big Daft Punk fan, but I found the majority of this album is pretty mellow. Derezzed and Finale are pretty much the only 2 tracks I listen to. I understand that it is a film score, but I still expected a little more from Daft Punk.
B0027BOL4G|4.0|Interesting info but delivered in a boring format.  I had to watch it a few times bc my mind kept wandering  bc of the monotone  voice of the narrator.

B0079K4WEE|3.0|PLOT SPOILER ALERT!<br /><br />I don't get the 4 and 5 star reviews.  Is this depressing film an apocalyptic fable, or a cautionary tale, or \\"when the world comes to an end, you still have each other and your love\\"?  Perhaps the first two, definitely not the last \\"love\\" scenario. As far as leaving the theater and being filled with life, someone spiked your Pepsi.<br /><br />If the director & writer were intending to do a somewhat realistic film, and not a fantasy, then they failed.  They have given us a virus that first knocks out your sense of smell, then taste, then hearing, then sight, and finally (not shown in the film) your sense of touch.  \\"Love\\" as an outward display of affection, is non-existent in a world where you cannot smell, taste, hear, see, or touch the one you love.  It is not the \\"Perfect Sense\\", it is not even a sense.  What is left is a feeling/emotion called \\"love\\" that was derived from the senses, and absent the five senses becomes a memory.<br /><br />The logical conclusion of this movie is that the human population becomes extinct.  Each person dies because of starvation or suicide, alone -- probably in fear.  After that, there is not even the memory of \\"love\\" on this planet.  The only way our two protagonists could have ended this tragic movie with \\"love\\", was if -- while they still had their sense of touch -- they took cyanide and hugged and kissed good-bye.<br /><br />I gave this film 3 stars because Ava Green is worth watching in any film.  She does her best acting when she has no make-up on.  (Bet you thought I was going to say something else.)<br /><br />This is not a film you will watch more than once.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|kudos to howey  it has been a long time since i read such a page turner. everything about this book is amazing. the plot the ideas the characters.  and the writing is so good.  i feel like sharing this book with everyone i know (and i will) just for the sheer gift of joy
B007OUFESC|3.0|The problem with this as a movie, is you keep waiting for something dramatic to happen.  Something that will involve you, the viewer.  A patient who is a borderline psychotic (not neurotic as is her diagnosis in the film), is hardly a dramatic revelation.  Nor is it eye opening for a doctor to have a sexual relationship with his patient, even in turn of the century Vienna or Switzerland.  The director has Keira Knightley over play the psychotic patient role to the point of being stereotypical and a distraction. You almost want to say \\"enough, already!  Nor does the director have her (in the end of the film) seem \\"cured\\" as she states.  She always displays a nervous tick, even in her final scene with Jung.<br /><br />As psychoanalytical history, the break between Freud and Jung came when Jung switched from the individual patient, to the whole of humanity as the patient, and saw \\"archetypes\\".  Today, Jung is a footnote in the history of psychoanalysis, and Jungian therapists are rapidly diminishing.  Freud's approach is still the most favored of those who do \\"talk therapy\\".<br /><br />And those damn cigars gave Freud cancer of the jaw, forcing its removal.  Anna Freud said (after her father's death) that he wished he never smoked, and concluded that it was a neurotic habit with possible oral fixations to his being weened too soon.<br /><br />This is a film to rent, not buy.
030758836X|4.0|Gillian Flynn has written two other \\"dark\\" novels and I looked forward to Gone Girl.  Could not put down but was disappointed with the ending.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I read the media reviews, and thought it was going to be crap.  Even Disney wrote the movie off as a total loss.  Then I rented it, and boy was I surprised!  The damn thing grabs you in the first 5 minutes and doesn't let go till the end of the film.  And I am not a SciFi fan!<br /><br />Rent the film first, then see if you agree.  I am going to buy it from Amazon.
B005KDJCE2|5.0|I have liked Airbag since the first CD. My only gripe is that they need to expand their keyboard backing and bring in some female backing vocals (a la Pink Floyd). One last thing..... the vocalist needs a bit wider \\"variety\\" because what I have noticed is that it is making many of the songs sound the same (not musically, but vocally). That will kill the band if it doesn't change.<br />Production value is good, though they need the keyboards out front a bit more. Very nice songwriting. All-in-all it shows them getting closer to a bigger sound.... they just need to trust in their team to make it smooth, not forced. Some band with this kind of original music needs to come along to fill the empty space Pink Floyd has left. This band could do it if they play their cards right.<br />Only time will tell. Opening for Marillion on part of their tour will help their fan base a lot I am sure.
B007VTVGAQ|4.0|I don't normally write reviews, but this album sort of stuns me and I felt like I needed to add a few comments. Most of the reviews already cover nearly everything. This is the album that you will either love or hate. I think it's easy to say this is awful and ugly because of x, y and z. It's also easy to say it is amazing for the exact same reasons. This album reminds me a lot of the experimental jazz that came out decades ago. There are moments that remind me of Nina Simone and moments that remind me of the percussion work that Stewart Copeland has done throughout his career. This is the kind of album that can stick in your head.
B007V4LKRU|5.0|It seems that all of the negative comments are from supposed fans who simply want the same old writing and songs as they already have. Any band of quality will stretch out a bit in their style and writing. And that is exactly what Rush has done here. And it's fresh, original, and sounds incredible.<br />The more I listen to this the more I like it. That the sign of good writing. The material that I like most today all took a while before they impressed me.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This book came highly recommended from members of my book club, and I wish I would have listened to them and read it much sooner than I did!<br /><br />Where do I start; the college experience, fraternity parties with pissing contests over girls, gambling, underground fight clubs?! Every single one of these elements is portrayed in Beautiful Disaster and weave together seamlessly through a series of intense, yet relevant subplots.<br /><br />Abby Abernathy has the coolest name on the block with a rather dark past. When she meets Travis, the tattooed, short-tempered fighter with a possibly darker past, she gives him a run for his money.<br /><br />It's refreshing to see main characters challenge each other, rather than the one-sided relationships we're used to seeing. Abby assumes she's challenging Travis by avoiding his advances, but she's really challenging him to be a better person. Travis isn't challenging Abby to get in bed; he's challenging her to love him for what he is and what he's trying to become.<br /><br />Further, the 2 most supporting characters (Shepley and America) play quite a large role in the story, but you're never suffocated by their presence. It's nice to see a cast, of sorts, in such a dynamic story.<br /><br />People make mistakes, people have pasts that catch up with them, and people need to live with consequences of their actions- all are written beautifully by Jamie and played out through Abby and Travis.<br /><br />I felt dragged through the emotional ringer and suffered gut punch after gut punch along with the characters. Once this book got in my head, I couldn't get it out and had to keep reading, and reading, and reading. The conclusion was satisfying in its own right, but I was left wanting more because I wanted to live in their world just a little longer.<br /><br />Definitely for the 18-30 crowd, and I wouldn't personally recommended for younger high school kids- a mature 17 or 18 year old could handle it- but anyone younger might get the wrong idea- or not appreciate it for the intensity it presents.<br /><br />This is the 3rd book I've ever given 5 stars to, and I stand by every single one.
B002ZG977Y|3.0|Very Post-Modern!  It's an original take on the traditional story theme of man vs. gods.  The gods only exist because humanity worships them.  If we don't worship them, then the gods will presumably die, though they don't necessarily say this.  So humanity makes a war on the gods and stops worshiping them.  In comes our hero, who is part-god but wishes to deny that reality.  The special effects are better than the original, but I got to say, I enjoy the original still better.  All in all, it is entertaining . . .
B007R41E8O|2.0|There is no way to play this game without hints!  You have to travel back and forth for one dumb thing, time and time again, to the point where I thought it had to be a joke. There were a lot of hidden object rooms, then you would have to go back to them and do it all over again with a new list for another item!  The ending was bad!  There were ads!  On the other hand; the Graphics were great, some of the Puzzles were fun, when you got them.  For the price I sould be happier but I am just so frustrated with the back and forth and having to hit \\"hint\\" so many times!
B005LAIGRS|3.0|This is the same stock picture as any modern spy film . . . CIA bad, burned spy wanting to blow a whistle on everything, the young impressionable agent caught in the mix.  What makes this movie entertaining is the setting of South Africa, which is a unique location, and the acting is better than most spy films.  It's worth a rental, but it certainly isn't anything original or mind-blowing.  The ending is so commonplace, I figured it out half-way through.  I've seen this movie before, under a different title and with different actors.  I wish they'd give us an original spy film.  But overall, it's a fun film that was beautifully shot and wonderfully acted.  It even adds little bit of South African soccer to it.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game has something to do every second that you are playing it. lots of ways to earn money to build up your city. I just wish the land expansions could be bigger for the price!! :)
B0072GPQNG|5.0|Beautiful movie!  What an interesting story to tell.  I loved it.  I was expecting something totally different and was incredibly surprised.  I love a good war film and though this was more about the horse than the war, it was still a phenomenal war movie.
B0053TMP24|3.0|The first thing I would like to say is, if I was reviewing the story elements alone: plot, characterization, diction, et cetera, I would give \\"The Son of Neptune\\" a five out of five. Unfortunately, the kindle version is full of editing and spacing problems. Words are split halfway through, only for the second half to be attached to the first half, giving the allusion to the passive reader that there is one long word on the page. New lines are started halfway through sentences, making readers unsure of when Rick Riordan wanted to start a new paragraph. I read the book on a kindle I borrowed from a friend of mine the day it came back and I have not been able to return to the kindle version since, so I don't know if the problem's been updated and fixed, but when it first came out the editing quality was atrocious.
B0086700CM|4.0|I love this app! I recommend it. the only thing i dont like about it is that when I swipe it wont turn. anyway get it. it is very addictive
B007I2BZIE|3.0|I have been a Rush fan since 1979 and first saw them in 1981. To give you an idea of my tastes, I actually preferred the keyboard years with Power Windows and Hold Your Fire, followed by the Farewell To Kings, Hemispheres, Permanent Waves, and Moving Pictures period. I would love to see them re-do 2112 with better vocals. I hated Vapour Trails and much of Counterparts.<br /><br />Being that I saw them play Caravan and BU2B on the last tour, I was not really looking forward to the \\"in your face\\" approach displayed on those two songs, which open up this new album. So I ordered 4 new releases by other artists from Amazon to go along with this one. The box of 5 new CD's arrived nine days after this was released, so I had time to read all of the polarized reviews. Of course, this new Rush CD got played first. I hate to admit it, but it was by far the least enjoyable out of the entire box. So what happened to my beloved band of Canadians?<br /><br />The first clue is the cover, with the clock showing the time at 9:12, which is 21:12 on the 24-hour clock.  Hmmm! A subtle hint from that concept album released about 40 years ago led me to first believe that this was planned as their masterpiece four decades later. Well, the concept is great! But musically, I think that they just tried too hard. Many have blamed the producer, but how can one do that when he was the same guy who did a great job on Snakes And Arrows? That argument of bad production just doesn't fly. The first five songs made me want to turn the damn thing off, just droning on and on, but The Anarchist and Carnies do have some good moments. Things lightened up with Halo Effect (a title of one of my own lyrics from two years ago, and dare I say, was better than Neil's version, even if the tone of mine was negative). I wound up finding the rest of this one likable, with my favorites being Headlong Flight, The Wreckers, Wish Them Well, and The Garden. Basically this album whips your tail in the beginning and then apologizes in the end by trying to tell you that everything will be okay.<br /><br />What else do I not like about this one? Well, I learned a new word called \\"steampunk\\", which describes all of the images on this one as well as their last release. Once again, this now qualifies them as \\"arena rock\\" instead of progressive rock, because this whole concept was done with the express intent of doing an over-the-top live show with all of these steampunk images. Yes, it can be quite trippy, but I am too old for all of the heavy foolishness trying to figure out what they really are trying to say. Heavy!!!? It so happens that I could care less for steampunk art and hidden meanings.<br /><br />I have a better idea for their next concept album. Based upon all of these polarized reviews from all of us old geezers (and a few young ones too), they can set the scene at Judge Roy Bean's Saloon in Langtry. Since the place only holds about a half dozen patrons at a time, Rush can have all of us old geezers take turns sitting down to have a few drinks in the place. Some will bitch and some will rave about their greatness. I will let you guess which side drinks the most! Of course, our three Canadian heroes would be behind the bar laughing their tails off. Okay, so that is kind of a recycled version of them playing as the German Oompah band in the video on the last tour, but what the heck, everything is recycled these days, including Rush's own signature riffs. How else could it be Rush?<br /><br />So this latest from Rush is what it is and I neither hate it all nor love it all, hence three stars. Is it better than the other drek out there these days? Not really. (Gosh, I really hate to admit this, but at least I am being honest.) Will I continue to be a fan until the day I die? Absolutely!pologizes in the end by trying to tell you that everything will be okay.<br /><br />What else do I not like about this one?

B007SYWFRM|5.0|love this game. fun for the whole family. weird at first but I still love itt. buy it to day!!!!
B007SGM084|1.0|I think the word murmur is on every single page of this book. Also it is a vagina not a \\"sex\\". I felt like I was hearing a teenager describe their sexual escapades with their controlling first boyfriend. Every time I hear the word murmur from now on I will remember that these books described every single person talking in a murmur.
B006R1T40I|5.0|I have been a fan of Bonnie Raitt for decades, both as an artist and a caring human being. So when she released a new album after so many years I was concerned that it would not meet the high standards of her past work. I was so relieved on finding another fabulous release. This is vintage Bonnie; she sounds and plays as good as ever. I love this album; I play it over and over again. I have been so disappointed in some of the releases of people I had always admired, but this album was such a wonderful, pleasant event (I really cannot call it a surprise).
B005LAIIRQ|1.0|Not much positive to be said about this movie. Characters are one dimensional, volves are behaving unrealistically, director is fishing for sentimental reactions every third minute of the movie with some flash back of the wife or kid of one of the rough neck . It all seems awfully calculated and down rght stupid.  Coming from Finland, it's hard to believe that someone would freeze to death, if rivers are running free and sun is shining. Silly movie for silly people.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I won't get into all the details because this book is huge and others have done a great job of that.  Suffice it to say I really enjoyed the book, the first in the series.  I was drawn in from the minute I met the Starks and their dire wolves.  After reading it and the next two, I found myself using words like \\"craven.\\"  If you like the fantasy genre, dirt, sex, and have a good memory as there are so many characters to remember, than this just might be for you.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I was just going to download \\"We Are Young\\", but I decided to go ahead and get the whole album, and I'm so glad I did.  There are so many amazing songs on this album that don't get played on the radio.
B005LAIHXQ|1.0|well, that's it: wonderful visuals with stupid story and stupider characters. That's a Riddley Scott film for you.<br />So, i'll just focus on the character's behavior. Warning: spoilers ahead!<br />Oh my, where to begin?<br />- A team of misfits with severe behavioral problems chosen to be crew members on a trillion-dollar expedition.<br />- a geologist that looks like a street mugger and smokes pot inside a space suit, panics at the first sight of a dead alien and then, being, of course, the person who maps the caves, gets instantly lost.<br />- A retarded biologist that tries to pet a snake-like alien creature that is displaying blatantly obvious aggressive behavior.<br />- Another retarded paleontologist that has no right to the name of scientist and comes up with the \\"engineer\\" theory based only on her personal feelings and religious beliefs.<br />- Another retarded paleontologist that sees tentacles coming out of his eyes and hides the fact from everybody else for no reason at all.<br />- An emotionless robot that displays sarcasm and a varied set of other emotions.<br />- THE WORST SURGERY SCENE EVER SHOWN ON SCREEN OR OFF IT (by the way, displaying amazing lack of imagination and incredible ignorance; if the machine was programmed for males (supposedly, it's Wayland's), it should make a top-to-bottom incision, but it made a lateral incision, which is the one used in caesarian anyway. Also, no anesthetics from the supposedly standalone medical module (spray on skin does not count. And cauterizing and stapling to close the incision. Really, folks, that's just lack of imagination: they copied standard caesarian procedure, and made it a thousand times worse. If that's future medicine, I'm out of it!!!)<br />- Also, Shawn's inhuman resistance after the operation (the rest of the movie) is ridiculous.<br />- They open the door of the ship to something that's obviously not human, from its posture (impossible to a human), just because it's wearing Fifield's suit?!<br />- And then, the Engineers, the crowning imbeciles of all. Why did the engineer in the prologue have to sacrifice himself before the ship posturing as a sky god? Wouldn't just his blood with the black slime (which seems to create all kinds of life) work the same?<br />- I don't care why they wanted to destroy humanity. That's one of the films'  mysteries and it's ok. But why make a monster vector that implants other monsters inside people? That's stupid. A virus would work a lot better and be much more energy-saving to engineer (pardon the pun).<br />- Why does the awakened engineer charges blindly at the humans? He only succeeds because they had no weapons with them (oh, yes, another thing we have to thank Shawn's imbecility for). And then, after his ship has been crashed by the tiny humans, he goes charging after Shawn blindly and with his bare hands, again!!!!<br />The problem is that the characters are irrational and idiotic, when they should not be. They should be the cream of earth's scholars and scientists - remember, it's a trillion dollar mission to save Weyland's life. Why would he bet his life on imbeciles? And this never happens in good science fiction. but then again, I'm afraid those who think this is a good movie (aka good story, not good visuals, that you can get from a screen saver) have never read good science fiction, like Isaac Asimov, Arthur Clarke, Robert Heinlein, Philip K. Dick, or Howard Philips Lovecraft (who mixes sci-fi and horror very well in his stories), and so many others that were REAL writers, not just people who put words together.<br />However, I haven't read the movie's original script yet. After I do, I'll find out whether the rumors that Scott messed with it are true, and discover that he has really embraced religious idiocy and bad Hollywood clichés.<br />But after Blade Runner he hasn't made a really good movie - except visually, they are all stunning. 1492 is so bad that he didn't even research history. People had knownthe Earth wasn't flat since the Middle Ages, and, in some cases, before that! This is just current-day cliché from the historically-illiterate. So, I'm afraid Alien and Blade Runner are fortunate accidents and the rest of his opus just shows that the Congress should approve an act forbidding Riddley Scott from messing with film scripts or even choosing them. Just direct them they way they are, and everything will be fine. That law should also apply to James Cameron, with an addendum forbidding him to write his own scripts. Same case as Scott, only worse.
B001R0XNSI|4.0|Okay, the title is something of a joke.  This is essentially a very beefy pen made of a stronger than usual plastic housing and much more of it than would be normal.  The method of cap retention, with its long series of threads, means it will stay affixed under hard use.  Good for a defensive item, bad as a pen.  But that's not why you'd buy this.  Where this pen shines is as described, as a defensive item.  If you live or work in a location where you can't legally conceal a handgun, or even have a simple pocket knife, you almost certainly live in a place where you may have a pen on you.  The size and shape lend it well to acting as a kubaton undercover where defensive items in general are banned.  If you're a student or in an office setting, this is something you can carry which won't turn heads, but, if you're practiced in its use, can be a good reach extender, force multiplier, or joint locker.<br /><br />With one caveat.<br /><br />Come on, Cold Steel, I know you're proud of your products, you have every right to be.  But having \\"COLD STEEL POCKET SHARK\\" and a shark emblem on the black body of the already slightly conspicuous pen just calls for someone to wonder if there's at least a knife hiding in it or a mini pepper sprayer.  My advice--do what I did and mask off the inner pen part, spray the body with white spray paint.  It'll look like an off-brand Sharpie.  It's a pen, should look like one.<br /><br />Unless you're trained in the use of a device of this type, you won't be able to use it with supreme effectiveness, and, even if you are, it's a short-range tool.  But sometimes it's all you can have, and other times it's the best thing for the job.  Considering the light weight and secondary application of a writing utensil, it's a good thing to have along wherever you go and can make quite an impact with a good thrust.<br /><br />Plus, it's fun to say \\"Pocket Shark.\\"

What a talent....what a voice.

B006RUJST6|4.0|When Lake's father dies suddenly, her mother decides to move their family from familiar Texas to the small town in Michigan where she grew up. Independent, beautiful, and intelligent Lake falls quickly for her neighbor Will, and when their younger brothers become instant best friends, it seems like the perfect set up for a new start. However, when they discover a secret that could threaten the lives they are building, they begin to wonder if the stakes are just too high to risk it.<br /><br />Slammed starts strong with well written characters, unexpected twists and turns, and offers a solid narrative. Colleen Hoover manages to write Lake, Will, and Julia's vulnerabilities without making them tiresome or needy. She explores challenging situations that have no right answer, making the moral path the story goes down exciting, but also thought provoking. The book includes slam poetry and she uses visual effects such as boldface type to help place the reader at the event, almost as if you were sitting in the audience listening, making a technique that could come off as irritating or trite into something powerful and affecting. Additionally, the poems are great and the device isn't overused.<br /><br />Bottom line - I couldn't put it down. Definitely worth the price.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|easy to use and loaded with funtions that useful . nice choice of filters to apply and rendering is fast.  runs very stable
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|Rock of Ages is a great soundtrack - loads of fun, very entertaining - and it rocks. I'd recommend this album to fans of music from the 80's.
0345803485|1.0|The success of this book proves that the average adult female audience who buys 10,000,000 copies of this are actually a bunch of sixth grade-level readers who cling to crap romance novels like they were a life ring thrown from the Titanic. We bought it because it was highly recommended, and now our esteem of those who recommended it has fallen substantially. Forbes magazine recently questioned whether or not this book was \\"dangerous,\\" due to the subject matter. My worry is that it is dangerous, because to shows that a no-talent Twilight-knockoff Harlequin-wannabe writer can become a bestselling author. Really, what does it say about this country?<br /><br />If you read this trilogy, the terrorists win.
0345803485|4.0|Although I am enjoying the writer's style. The content of the story line is a lil less than expected in terms of steaminess. Characters are fun to follow and Im enjoying the way Ana deals with Grey most times. A good summer read.
B000LC55F2|5.0|My friends and I chose to watch this at a small get together. It was perfect. Beautiful filming, great twists in the plot, LOVE the actors....love this movie. Also loved who I bought it from. Great experience.
0425263908|5.0|I loved the Fifty Shades trilogy and wanted more.  A friend recommended Bared to You stating \\"If you loved Fifty, you'll like this.\\"  This story of want and desire doesn't disappoint.  Per Silvia Day's website, this will be a trilogy.  Book 2 is due out in October.  I can't wait to see what happens with Eva and Gideon.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|While I would not expect this book to win any literary awards, it does have an interesting story line.  The intimate sections are very explicit and a bit numerous.  I continued to read the entire trilogy because of the relationship and how it unfolded.  I would recommend it as adult reading with the understanding that there is strong intimate content.
B00785P2QC|5.0|it is amazing! I recommend it for anyone who likes city building games! I playnthis game all the time! it is about the only game I play!
159514188X|5.0|Th1rteen R3asons Why is a thought-provoking story about love, loss, friendship, high school and tragedy.  Clay's character is one anyone can relate to.  He is that person who didn't say what he wanted to, and then found out that it was too late.  Hannah's voice on the tapes is cryptic, sarcastic and brutally honest.  The insight that Asher provides into their lives and brains makes them seem as if they could be your friend, or even you.  This book was wonderful and sad with comic relief intermixed in all the right places.  This is a book that I would definitely recommend.
B003661X0G|5.0|I have this on my desk at work as a decoration.  It's inexpensive and cute and I haven't had any issues with it.

B003O86FMW|5.0|It is one of the best books I've ever read( along the other HUNGER GAMES books). All the books take you on a magnifecent journey reading. I love the divine vocabulary, desprictions so detailed and fabulous that you can just see the image of the moment right in your head, and the exemplary ideas the author had to think of and put together to receive the answer of these three MAGNIFICENT BOOKS!!!<br />  THESE BOOKS ARE A  MUST READ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

0439023483|1.0|I'm just reminded again of what terrible shape the world is truly in when a piece of garbage such as this which glorifies the killing of children becomes extremely popular. It's not well written, far from it - in fact it is dumbed down for today's readers. I have no idea what is wrong with people today. Too much McDonalds and corn.
B00753MBHA|4.0|WHAT A GREAT FOLLOW UP TO BLOOD OF THE NATIONS. IN MY OPINION, BLOOD OF THE NATIONS IS AN ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE!  THIS DISC IS FANTASTIC BUT THERE IS SOMETHING MISSING THAT BLOOD CAPTURED. ANDY SNEAP PRODUCED THIS CD, TOO, BUT AS MANY REVIEWERS HAVE MENTIONED IT FALLS JUST SHY IN COMPARISON TO BLOOD. SO, TO BE FAIR WHY COMPARE. ENJOY STALINGRAD FOR THE HEAVY METAL ONSLAUGHT IT DELIVERS. AGAIN, THE CD IS PACKAGED WITH A PICTURE OF EACH BAND MEMBER AND COMES WITH SONG LYRICS. LEAD SINGER MARK TORNILLO HITS SOME VERY HIGH NOTES AND HIS GROWL AND POWERFUL VOICE RESONATE THROUGHOUT EACH SONG.  WOLF ONCE AGAIN DOES NOT GET THE RESPECT HE DESERVES WITH HIS MASTERFUL GUITAR RIFFS. HE CARRIES THIS DISC FROM START TO FINISH. WHAT A WONDERFUL SURPRISE THESE LAST TWO CDS HAVE BEEN...THE MIGHTY ACCEPT ROCK!

B000024Y9L|4.0|Well, there's Maiden fans and there's classic Maiden fans, and that's fine, but if you want 80s Maiden, don't expect it here - pick up the Dickinson solo albums from this era with Adrian Smith (Accident of Birth and Chemical Wedding), those have the classic Maiden sound with modern, drop-tuned metal touches.  What Maiden did in the 90s was - completely ignore the 90s and go their own way.  In fact, in the early 90s, they went for a classic Judas Priest, AC/DC, Deep Purple inspired version of Iron Maiden, while the late 90s albums (including this one) used a more subdued guitar tone (inspired, to my ears, by Rush, Queensryche, and mid-period Fates Warning, maybe?) with new singer Blaze Bayley having a deeper, croonier, moody vocal style more reminiscent of Dio (but less rock'n'roll).  It's a different sound, but it still is more Iron Maiden than it is anything else - it's not like the 90s mainstream rock direction taken by Metallica's \\"Load\\"s or Def Leppard's \\"Slang\\".<br />  \\"Virtual XI\\" is a little brighter and faster than the moody, dirgy \\"X Factor\\" of '95.  It kind of reminds me of Somewhere in Time - both due to the SciFi lyrical/art themes and the fact that both albums seem a little less dark and dangerous than the band's other works.  But, also, both albums still have the basic metalness of songwriting - I mean, Iron Maiden never goes into hair metal territory like Judas Priest's \\"Turbo\\", for example!  That said, \\"Angel & The Gambler\\" has kind of a classic rock feel (The Who come to mind) crossed with \\"Heaven Can Wait\\".  At 9+ minutes, I was hoping for a classic Maiden epic, but it mainly repeats the same line (\\"Don't you believe I'm your saviour\\" - but, without, to my understanding, the Christian overtones that line would normally imply) a million times while \\"bringing it down\\" and building it up again.  I think this is the kind of thing that should've been saved for the live version, on album it becomes too repetitive, leaving this a flawed song that I neverthelss rather like.  \\"The Clansman\\", however, IS a classic Maiden epic, and went over pretty well in live shows when Bruce rejoined.  \\"Como Estais Amigos\\" is kind of a ballad, but avoids the cliches of the typical power ballad (that is, it's a mellow metal song that's still musically interesting, rather than simply a boring soft rock song written by a metal band) and has a nice instrumental section in the middle.  \\"Futureal\\" is the fast, rocking opener and succeeds pretty nicely at this.  \\"When Two Worlds Collide\\" is pretty much a classic Maiden-style song, with the current \\"sound\\" of '98.  Overall, I like the songs, I like the sound - it's not the fast, dangerous, Iron Maiden of the 80s, but it's good music by a band that still contains many of the great musical elements that made Maiden stand out in the metal scene when they started.  I bought this when it first came out in 1998, and I've found it holds up well to repeated listens - it may not come out as often as \\"Powerslave\\" or \\"Brave New World\\", but it's a welcome change every now and then for this Iron Maiden fan.
0307913090|3.0|If one likes epic, involved, action-adventure, multi-layered, densely-charactered fiction, this book is a superb read.  However, the audio version (narrated by Roy Dotrice, a venerated actor and friend of the author) is barely tolerable.  Overall, the characters are given voicings comparable to a group of crotchety old dudes from the Home having a Talk Like A Pirate contest, which was both distracting and exasperating. With no immediate access to a hard copy, I stuck it out to the end, but cannot endure another (all the books are read by Mr Dotrice.)  I'll read the rest of the series on the printed page, and look forward to HBO.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|Do not listen to the other reviews that are stating that this movie is bad because it isn't at all!! I loved this movie I even went and saw it twice in the theater :) If you are not confident with what I say rent the movie first and then buy it :D
B007SGM084|2.0|Reading the first book was so-so, but by the second book the \\"oh my\\" and \\"in a nanosecond\\" was getting a bit ridiculous.  I barely read 25 pages of the last book, I skipped page after page,  I kept hoping the story line was going to take off but no such luck.  Except for the sexual content this book is for tweens.  Very disappointed.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|One of the hardest things a writer has to do sometimes is write factually and accurately about himself.  Chris Kyle does this well.  I found his story engrossing and filled with what the daily grind of deployment into hot zones is like, sometimes exciting and heart-pounding euphoric and at other times ploddingly slow and mind-numbingly boring.<br /><br />It isn't a \\"big moment on every page\\" kind of read, but then again, life isn't either.  His service, his dedication to a very personal and unique skill and his sacrifice for the good of our nation is worth the read.  I strongly encourage to explore what life was like in Chris Kyle's Iraq.<br /><br />Retired USAF Gulf War Veteran

B000QRIGLC|5.0|I read Marcus' Lone Survivor and was humbled by the story of faith, courage, determination, sacrifice and service of not just him but the US Navy SEAL Community in general.  His story captures what it takes to become a SEAL, what it menas to wear the trident and what the word \\"sacrifice\\" really and truly means.  He witnessed first-hand what courage is, and watched his team member display it in spades; an act that earned the man a posthumous Medal of Honor.<br /><br />Reading this book is worth your time, as it is the least anyone can do to honor and understand what oru men and women in uniform are doing in service to our great country.<br /><br />Retired USAF Gulf War Veteran

B0064BWE8U|4.0|I love Sophie Kinsellas books. They are the perfect prescription for feeling flat or tired and wanting to read withut taxing your brain. I mean that as a compliment really! They're just easy to read, they're well written and the characters are lively and easy to love. I do get frustrated with how stupid the women can sometimes be... How much I want them to hurry up and get a clue for goodness sakes... But I loved Sam and I loved to hate Magnus... Awesome.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I have read many epic fantasy series, new and old. Blood Song shoots to the top of the list as one of the most interesting and hard ton put down reads. This book will not dissapoiny and is truelynworth the 5 star rating.<br /><br />The story is told with a good pacenofncharcter development and plot revealing. Keeping the reader encaged but notnsure asbto what is coming next. It was so well written that it even had my wife askining me about what was happing as she enjoyed hearing my retelling of the story and then discussing points of religion, the programming/up-bringing of children and politics that we posed in the book.<br /><br />The biggest challeng is waiting for the next book.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Very nice - allows multiple languages dictionaries at the same time,  good auto-correct functionality.  Customizable delay before long press brings up alternate key functions.<br />Much nicer than the standard Motorola keyboard.
B000BZISTE|2.0|If you're use to the TV series you'll need to reset your mind to enjoy the movie.  Much darker and more difficult to get into, the basics for the series are there but very well hidden.  Watch it without expectations and you could be impressed.  After years of the series I found it difficult to follow, but found it added some history to the characters that I had missed.
B005D9MUWY|1.0|I get that any keyboard will load as a service, but this app also kept open the Amazon Market App. That's another 12 megs of memory used. Why would the market app need to be opened all the time? Does the keyboard constantly Check in to make sure I've bought it? 37 megs I'd way too much memory to be tied up in a keyboard app. Uninstalled.
B0052VUNHC|1.0|Possessive, controlling and regularly assaulting others for breathing in the direction of his girlfriend. This main character would have arrested multiple times for his over-the-top aggression. I kept waiting for the main character Pidge (an appropriate name for such a doormat) to wake up and recognize this behavior what what it is - domestic violence.
B005LAIGN2|1.0|We just rented Red Tails. From the moment I began to see the advertisements for the movie I was anticipating it's release! The Tuskegee Airmen deserved better than this cheaply made movie. It lacked in so many areas. Seemed the movie focused more on racism issues than it did these valiant airmen.<br /><br />I was ready for some great aerial scenes, there were \\"some\\" attempts but it was poorly done.<br /><br />The dialogue seemed fragmented, missing pieces that left you with the feeling that you must have skipped a page of the story.<br /><br />So glad we didn't BUY this one!

B0064NTZJO|5.0|Drive is a movie that makes you remember how exhilerating it can be to watch paint dry.  First off, This movie is terrible because I have a severe attention deficit disorder.  If Nikola Tesla Reefin' had laid off the weed for a few  months, he might have been able to elevate this material to Crank-worthy heights.  Or at least he could have attempted to get some depth in the main character by casting someone like Jason Statham who is actually very subtle and a deep well of talent.  Unfortunately, nuance doesn't suit this material because I think it should be another awesome paint by numbers wham-bam-shoot-em-up, because you know, the movie is called \\"Drive\\" not \\"Park.\\"  I tried to ignore the soundtrack because my favorite band is Nickelback.  Hey, what should you drink for breakfast if you like nickelback?  Milk.  What should you drink for breakfast if you hate Nickelback?  Battery Acid. Ha!<br /><br />*Review by Peter Pecker.<br /><br />favorite movies: Rambo (the new one), Friday the 13th (the new one), Crank/Crank 2 (the best!)<br />least favorite movies: Ones with a plot, ones with character development, art films, anything with Robert Deniro, anything without Taylor Laughtner (so hot!

B0031OCY2E|5.0|I loved the Marvin Hamlisch throw back music which greatly enhanced the story. Matt Damon is a biochemical engineer for Archer Daniels Midland. He is in charge of lysine production, which is having problems. He claims the problem is a virus that a Japanese mole has introduced to the product. The FBI is called in. Matt informs the FBI of another evil that is on going...international lysine price fixing! Matt comes across as a squeaky clean guy who only wants to help make things right. He believes by informing on his company, the board of directors will reward him for doing right, by making him CEO. If you don't see the humor in that, you most likely won't enjoy the film.<br /><br />The FBI has Matt go undercover in what is the nerdiest undercover man to wear a wire. I had to laugh at Matt's character as he played 0014 spy. When things start to hit the fan, it gets weird and twisted.<br /><br />This reminded me of an old 60's style comedy with Damon being super intelligent and naive. I would have enjoyed the film even if it wasn't based on a true story. Great characters.<br /><br />PARENTAL GUIDE: F-bomb, no sex or nudity.

B007918P1E|3.0|I wasn't as impressed with this album by Epica as I have been with passed albums but it was still an ok album.
0439023521|4.0|Unlike some readers, I had the pleasure of meeting this book after I saw the movie. And I have not read the 2 other books. Usually before I write a review, I make a point of reading all of the previous reviews of the book on this site. Unfortunately the sheer mass of these makes this impractical. So I might be stating views already given, but here goes.<br /><br />The most interesting aspect of what reviews I did read were those by people negative. Like KMR, who suggested that &#34;the premise ... lacks authenticity&#34; and &#34;the people of Panem are so resigned ... they never question it&#34; and &#34;in 74 years, not even one tribute has questioned the mandate&#34;. But look at our own unlamented North Korea. Under a stifling and near absolute dictatorship that harks back to 1945 when World War 2 ended 67 years ago. Where in the last 20 years a famine killed over a million people. Yet no rebellion. The 67 year Korean rule is not so far from the 74 years of the Hunger Games. Perhaps the reviewer should be more cognisant of actual history.<br /><br />Then there is the reviewer Pseudotriakis, who opined that &#34;the book is boring&#34;. Here the overwhelming mass of readers would absolutely disagree. As you can see by trolling the reviews, most found it gripping. And that is the verdict of the marketplace, based on the book's success. Plus, the movie was a faithful rendition of the book, as stated by the author herself. The movie was a smash for 2012. Which goes to show that the book was not boring.<br /><br />Further, Pseudotriakis ventures that &#34;Even when she is forced to kill, she feels little or no remorse&#34;... &#34;The author never lets her kill pre-emptively, only allowing her to act in self defense&#34;. The reviewer lacks enough introspection to see that he is largely answering his own question. The reason that Katniss feels no remorse is basically because she killed in self defense. Though I suggest that the author did this precisely to avoid the harder issue of how to depict the character if she had indeed killed several opponents, especially if this was done deliberately. If you read the book and think back slowly over the tournament events, you might get an extra appreciation for what Collins did and her skill as a writer. For all of the action and deaths, Katniss manages to segue aside. This lets her emerge at the end not as a hardened stone cold killer, and much easier for the reader to identify with.<br /><br />I suggest that overall the critical comments about the society or societies in the book inadvertently show the author's constraint. She built this out into 2 more books where she fleshed out those facets. Including from what I can gather in the blurbs, where indeed people rebel against Panem. If she had put these into the current book, it would have made for a far longer text. Keep in mind one practical factor. This first book was market speculation by the author, as it really is for any author. She did not know how well it would be received. Investing too much time in a huge tome that was all 3 novels would have been a big risk of her time. Likely too that the publisher would have baulked at backing it.<br /><br />Hey, if you liked this novel, there is another story about a death match that starts with 64 gladiators in a future world. Each paired with an opponent and in every round half the players die, until only 1 is left. Berserker's Planet by Fred Saberhagen. Not as successful in the marketplace. Mostly perhaps because the characters in that book exhibit far less empathy than Hunger Games. The biggest differences with Hunger Games are that those fighters enter the contest willingly and can be of any age. If the combat premise of Collins was interesting and you want more, try that book. It is also a reminder that Collins certainly did not invent the idea of a death match with only one winner. Surely there are other books of death matches, but the Saberhagen text is what I've read.<br /><br />Another book recommendation that will be more germane to some readers is the companion text about the filming of the movie, The Hunger Games: Official Illustrated Movie Companion. Well composed and gives a cool backstory about the travails of filming in the forests of North Carolina.>Another book recommendation that will be more germane to some readers is the companion text about the filming of the movie, The Hunger Games: Official Illustrated Movie Companion.

B007URCTOG|5.0|I thought this was a very good movie wort a watch or even a buy. It is a romance movie but I think it show's what every woman or man hopes for in a relationship a deep unbreakable bond. The movie is a story of true love, and a message that no matter what I will fight you, and will always be there for you.....now who would not want that

B0086700CM|1.0|Why do Google/Amazon allow all these fake reviews in their app stores?? Punish the developers by making them play this awful game.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book kept me reading. Every chapter it went back and forth between husband and wife perspective which made it very intriguing. This is a semi-spoiler, but... don't believe everything the narrators say (or don't say)! It's really interesting to see how the characters (or your perspective of the characters) changes as the book progresses. Awesome read.

B004SEUJYG|3.0|Es una gran pel&iacute;cula que merec&iacute;a ser pasada a Bluray. La inclusi&oacute;n de un libro con fotograf&iacute;as e informaci&oacute;n adicional sobre los actores y el rodaje lo convierte en un material m&aacute;s que necesario para quien disfrute de las pel&iacute;culas b&eacute;licas. Para el consumidor de habla hispana es muy negativo la omisi&oacute;n de los subt&iacute;tulos en espa&ntilde;ol. Si bien est&aacute; doblado al idioma ib&eacute;rico, s&oacute;lo se puede escuchar con sonido estereo 2.0. Para escucharlo en ingl&eacute;s 5.0 s&oacute;lo da la alternativa de subt&iacute;tulos en Ingl&eacute;s o Canton&eacute;s. Un fallo tremendo.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think this app is a great find especially the fact there are so many games for free! I downloaded it with a bit of apprehension but it has kept me entertained because you have to reach a certain score in each game to get recognition and to unlock more games. Worth the time.
B006RED4GA|3.0|This movie was okay with the potential to have been SO much better. Sadly the good parts were withheld until about the last 15 minutes. I would not watch it again but I would recommend fans of hauntings give it a shot.
B000IKAHN2|4.0|A previous reviewer noted the poor editing of the series opener and part two. I will confirm the disconcerting issues: the opening sequences actually play twice; once several minutes into the content and again after the ending credits. There are several breaks lasting about 3 minutes each, with no transitions, no content, in the episode 1 play.<br /><br />The entertainment factor and story is done well in the series opener. Parts 1 & 2 flow nicely and builds the suspense! The first 2 episodes set the stage for the remainder of the season and series. So if you can tolerate the poor editing of the first 2 episodes of the Amazon video offering, you will be rewarded for a great SG-1 spinoff saga!
0876391277|5.0|A great, new, compact book with a nice touch of humor. This will get you started on an enormous variety of saxophone effects.  The short, precise explanations, exercises and audio examples deliver a hands-on approach.  Extra tips guide you along the way and recommended listening and reading provide the opportunity to learn even more. A variety of information on the author's website [...] complete the package.  A great book with a refreshing touch - suitable for teachers, students (even younger ones) and professionals alike.
B004Y12S9W|1.0|The adapter didn't work for me.  I have both iPad 2 and iPad 3 and no image is displayed when connect either iPad to my TV.  At times the iPad would show a device not support message.  I also noticed that the labeling on the adapter is incorrect.  It has the HDMI port labelled as the charging port and the charging port as the HDMI on the adapter itself.  Not a big deal at all.  All I care is that the adapter wroks but in my case it didnt.  I have another original/genuine apple TV adapter and it worked fine.  So I have to return this one that I bought now.
1451627289|2.0|11/22/63 gets all of two stars only because the lowest rating -- one star -- must be applied to utter dreck like The Da Vinci Code. King's prose, though clumsy and ponderous, never quite reaches the semi-literate, breathless trashiness of Dan Brown's. But saying that King is a better writer than Brown is like saying that Jimmy Carter was a better president than James Buchanan -- an empty compliment.<br /><br />The high-schoolishness of King's prose is the best thing about 11/22/63. The worst thing is that the \\"moral\\" of the story is straight from Paul Krugman's fever dreams: Bad things happen when Democrats lose elections. The world doesn't just fill with pestilence and hate, it begins to unravel physically. Let that be a warning to you, lest you be tempted to vote against Barack Obama this November.<br /><br />I don't remember how long it had been since I last read a novel by Stephen King, but I know how long it will be before I read another one -- forever.

B000H4QD1O|5.0|Probably the most inventive Sci-Fi show ever made.  Exceedingly realistic once you got passed the macguffin of interplanetary travel.  Great character-driven storyline.  But alas, the brain trust at FOX replaced this show with Temptation Island.  I hope that genius isn't even working at McDonalds, as he lacks the mental capacity for the most menial of jobs.  I've encouraged several of my friends to watch this series.  I've not found one that didn't like it, most really liked it, and a few have held off watching the last episode because they didn't want it to end.  How many TV series inspire that kind of devotion?
0307341577|4.0|This is probably the most brutal novel I have ever read though granted it is my first foray into this kind of crime thriller. It is an excellent book though at times I felt I had to take a break and/or a shower to get out of the darkness. The novel deals with the brutal and seemingly easily solved and prosecuted murder of a family in Kansas in which there was only one survivor, the seven year old daughter Libby. Doubt of her brother's guilt leads Libby to investigate the crime and make contact with the jailed brother. The details of the murder are not glossed over. Many of the characters are so dysfunctional and not terribly likable but you are dragged to see that many of them are not what they seem and to grudgingly respect if not outright like them. It shines a light on the fact that we all try to do the best we can with our families, but that despite our best efforts, many people screw up royally or become royally screwed up.<br /><br />Flynn's writing is like none I have ever read. Her descriptions are incredible but extremely odd: objects compared to things you would have never imagined them to be compared to. There is a description of a street of shabby houses whose owners make somewhat of an effort to keep them up. These houses are compared to a group of less than average looking girls who get themselves sequined and made up to go out to a bar with the hope that by placing the one average looking girl in the middle of the group, all the group would look more attractive. So many details are conveyed in the smallest of barely mentioned details: the main character, who lost several toes and fingers to frostbite while she hid out from the killer who murdered her family, has a hand upon which no man will ever place a wedding ring. If that doesn't tell you everything about the character's lovability factor..... These details and description allow Flynn to effortlessly create complex, fully developed characters.<br /><br />Not every novel has to have a happy ending.This one certainly doesn't have clear happy ending, but as disturbing as this novel is, you want there to be an unequivocal hopeful ending. However this ending is open to interpretation and only one interpretation could give you a glimmer of hope. But I kind of like that it is open to interpretation despite my gut wish.
B006ZEDZNY|4.0|This I<br />Was a decent movie to watch.  I always enjoy Johnny Depp as an actor and he didn't disappoint in this film.

That's just one thing.<br />Bang sticks made from shotgun shells and softwood branches?!  That's one for Myth Busters to be sure!<br />I give this one star.

030758836X|5.0|The blurbs on the book jacket are all true. This is one of the smartest works of fiction I've ever read. [It lands somewhere between 'Chicklit' and 'Woman's fiction' in that it mocks both of them. It's more David Foster Wallace-ish.] It is funny, very funny, and sad, and mostly true. Gillian Flynn has pretty much figured out the man/woman marriage/happiness thingy. Add to that slick and witty commentary on American culture and the writer's paradox (how much `truth' to tell) and you've got \\"Gone Girl.\\" But, fair warning: If you're happily married you might want to skip this one and just keep up the masquerade. (Note to Fylnn's husband: You've been warned.)

B00772M1F6|4.0|I heard this reviewed on NPR and the price was really good on Amazon, so I had to go for it.  It was really cool to hear JD McPherson's tracks.  They sounded so authentic as a blast from the past Rock n Roll from like the late 50's or possibly early 60's (a bit before my listening days).  The sound texture was great, and the variety in the lineup kept me listening all the way through the album.  I'm really glad I bought this and will be watching for this artist's future works!  p.s., I love it that he's so good and came from a small Oklahoma town not far from where I live.
B0070UFMOW|3.0|I just received my Fiio E17 on Thursday June 21, 2012 and now Sat. June 23, 2012 the headphone jack doesn't work. First I'd like to say that this amp really really worked for me. I'm not sure what setup others had but I can truly say that to myself and others in the vicinity - we all heard something wonderful. Now with that being said, what's up with the connection jack to the unit & to the device being Flimsy Flimsy Flimsy. My understanding upon further reading is that the QC has laxed and there are some of these out there that have gotten by QC. The sound is now gone except for a very low sound that you hear but then when you hold it, you hear one side of the cans at a time. I would like to get a replacement & don't really feel like going for the refund thing but If I must then I must. My setup is very nice and when I use this in conjunction with my cans and mp3 player, This is Something For The Radio has never sounded better!!!!!
0985114606|4.0|This is an erotic read, however not better than 50 Shades in my opinion.  Although I can't wait for the 2nd book to come out.  Personally, I think men should read these books & learn the fine balance between erotic love, vs. power/control & abuse.  Because there is a very fine line.
B00004YZ36|5.0|Hard not to gush over these recordings.  They are beautifully recorded (I've been working on the orchestral accompaniments to some of the concerti), and it is all so transparent.  Anda was a great Mozart pianist, and though I haven't listened to all of the very early concerti (who ever really does?), this is all splendid.
B0081KTI0E|3.0|The movie was ok. Plot was so-so, story was same as many others I have seen. Overall I gave it a 3 because it was not a total bore.
0312641893|5.0|To be honest, I picked up this book at my local library because of the exquisite cover. I am not that interested in cyborgs or things that hint at science fiction, but the cover, which is very well done, intrigued me.<br /><br />I was not disappointed. This book is a wonderful twist on the traditional Cinderella tale. This book sucked me in, and I read it in a day. The characters are well fleshed out, and the futuristic scenes are described excellently, even to my untrained 'eye'.<br /><br /> This book is definitely one I plan to buy, and I am waiting eagerly for the next in the series!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game! It is similar to my all time favorite game super mario brothers. Any one who has ever sat in front of the tv playing for hours on your new nintendo knows what i mean ;)
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is simple and fun. The use of repetitive movements with ever changing views creates a simple, refreshing gameplay hat never fails to bring excitement. Warning: you won't be able to stop playing.
B004LWZW8S|3.0|If you have a chance to watch this on a high quality home theater setup I definitely recommend it, because the focus and money for this production clearly went into the visual and audio design. I actually rented this on a whim without really knowing anything about it. It didn't take long for the very striking visual style to start reminding me of The Fall and The Cell, both of which were of course helmed by Tarsem Singh. I thought the movie was totally gorgeous to behold visually; beautiful and precipitous landscapes and other settings abound. Many scenes have a fairly static but impressive background with characters moving through it almost like figures moving through a painting. The sonics are also made for showing off your subwoofer, and if you like to rattle the furniture this movie will do it quite often. From a vicarious thrill standpoint, it's definitely a lot of fun.<br /><br />The story isn't great but isn't bad, mythological inaccuracies aside. The cast and performances are pretty credible overall. I'd compare it in that way to Avatar, which was just a serviceable story but was so compelling visually that it was still a very worthwhile movie to watch/experience.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It has good simple graphics and cool ending when you win to have a star diamond or circle display show
B0059XTUXQ|2.0|This movie uses the fairly common framing device of telling the story via flashbacks from the viewpoint of the aged subject of the film. In this case, I agree with many reviews that far too much of the movie focuses on the elderly, dementia afflicted Thatcher and not nearly enough on her achievements in rising to be the first female Prime Minister of Great Britain. Whether this was politically motivated or simply an artistic choice to focus on the more intimate, poignant end of life for a power figure, I don't know, but the movie suffered for it. It's unavoidable to compare and contrast this with other recent bio-pics of 20th century British figures such as The King's Speech and The Queen, which both come off FAR more cohesively than this fragmented film does.<br /><br />Streep gives her usual fantastic performance of course, but I wish I'd read reviews before watching this to at least be prepared for a huge disappointment.

Can anyone give me an answer as I don't want to be disappointed when I recieve it. I do not want the Blu-Ray version as I do not own a Blu-Ray player. Also will the 3-D version still play in regular DVD players if not then this is a drawback and do you/I need 3-D glasses to see it? Please respond.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I have read all 3 in the trilogy, hoping they would get better the more I read.  An interesting storyline that would have been a good read if the characters and history of each had been expanded upon; gratuitous sexual content.  Could have been a good 1 volume novel about the results of child abuse and neglect.  I am a child of the sexual revolution but DO NOT undrstand how pain and freakiness (as oppose to friskiness) can be associated with a loving relationship.  This is not what we women longed for!!  If you want titillation this is it; if you want a good story forget it!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and I am looking forward to reading it again and sharing it with my friends. Abby's relationship with Travis was full of twists and turns and at times even left me shocked. This book was very unpredictable, heart wrenching, exciting, and entertaining. Abby and Travis had an intense relationship that I ultimately fell in love with. The whole book was very original and 100% worthy of buying! This is the kind of story line that leaves you wondering what will happen next when it's not in your hands, and has you thinking about the characters even when you're not reading it. (P.S. the description says \\"Abby does not drink,\\" which always annoyed me because she sure knows how to drink). I've read a lot of books on my Kindle, but this is the first time I've written a review because I highly recommend it!

0307346617|4.0|When I first saw \\"World War Z\\" listed on NPR's top 100 Sci-fi and Fantasy Books list, I told myself, \\"One of those zombie gore-fests? Really? I'll never read that.\\" But this changed when my \\"zombie\\" friend convinced me it was more story than gore, much like \\"The Walking Dead\\" on AMC. He lent me the book and I promised to read it.<br /><br />It turns out that Max Brooks is a great story teller. He tells the story of mankind's ten year war against the zombies, presented as a series of interviews compiled by some unnamed character. Rather than concentrate on the gore and the gotta-kill-em as most zombie movies do, Max explores how humans react to the disaster.<br /><br />It begins with the story of a doctor who first came in contact with the disease. At first he's skeptical of the villagers' superstitious stories, but when he sees firsthand a boy's arm falling off without the boy screaming, he realizes this isn't an ordinary disease.<br /><br />As the epidemic expands, each country reacts differently. Some make stupid decisions, resulting in more casualties, while others are wiser. Some people shine as heroes, while others try to take advantage and earn money or power in creative ways.<br /><br />It's clear that Brooks has thought out what one should do in a zombie attack, but sometimes the science and logistics don't quite work out. For example, how is it the zombies only exist east of the Rockies in the USA? How exactly can one person survive the roads of a busy city full of zombies? But the story telling is so good, it's so easy to overlook these details.<br /><br />Each individual story is hit or miss. Most of them are hits involving an individual's story of survival. The misses usually cover something logistical and are usually short. One funny miss appears to exist only to jokingly refer to Brooks' own \\"Survival Guide.\\"<br /><br />Brooks does a decent job in speaking in different voices, though the tone of each interview is similar. He makes use of a lot of country-specific cliches. For example, a Korean story talks about some secret the North is hiding. A Japanese story talks about honor and involves one of those swords. The military people tend to drop F bombs, while scientists apologize for even getting close to cussing. These cliches are noticeable, but they work.<br /><br />My biggest complaint about the book is that the identity of each interviewee is withheld in the beginning and each time the reader must figure out who the person is. Sometimes this requires going back to reread earlier paragraphs. At the beginning of each interview, we're only given the place (not necessarily where the events occurred) and a short blurb from the interviewer describing the scenery. Had this been a real account of a real event, each interview heading would have included the person's name, and save the reader time spent on rereading.<br /><br />But I can see what drove Brooks' decision. There are a couple of stories that hinge on the interviewee's identity being revealed at the very end. But Max, did you really have to torture us through all the other stories where it would have really helped to know who was talking?<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this book. If you like \\"The Walking Dead\\", you'll like this book. And just like me, you'll probably choose your favorite story. Mine is the Chinese submarine one.ry-specific cliches.

B006O5XYWG|5.0|I didn't expect to like this movie but I really did enjoy it. I watched it because my son wanted to & ended up really enjoying it.
0099579936|1.0|BORING. Don't even get sucked into reading this book. I feel bad writing a bad review, but I am truly just confused about all the hype is surrounding this book.  I have no problem reading edgy, erotic stuff. This book is a far cry from good or tastfully done (I bite my lip for saying that, while blushing at the same time, but not quite reaching orgasm as I write - darn it, I guess I need someone like Christian Grey in my life...where oh where is he!!!).    What's the point of this book?  I found myself so tired and bored with it - tired of hearing how HOT Ana thinks Christian is....how HOT his look is, how HOT his t-shirts are, how HOT going in the elevator is with him, how HOT his tongue, his chest, his just @#$%^ hair is.....good golly....just reading the book made me exhausted for Ana, and him.  It is truly one of the most ridiculous, unrealistic novels I have EVER read.  How do these people function?  And what it up with his obsession about her eating, her lip biting, her smart mouth!!! Once I start a book, I always vow to finish it.  So just to get through it - I would begin to recognize when the long, long sex scences where going to start - I could easily tell when they ended (with the both screaming in agony from their mutual orgasms).  I was able to masterfully figure out how to begin skipping these parts, so I could get to the parts with substance, and allow myself to actually get to know the characters outside of their orgasms.  I think one sex scence every 10 pages would have even been better than practically ever other page.    Another thing - what is up with the CONSTANT arguing between these two people!!!! OMG!!!  Either through emails or in person, in the car, in the helicopter, in the elevator, on the Blackberry, in her bedroom, in the red room of pain, in the tub, in the shower, and so on and so on.  I have never \\"met\\" a couple who argues as much as these two argue, and still want to actually be together!  There is absolutely NO enjoyment in their relationship.  There is minimal laughter, minimal depth of wanting to build a life together, minimal admiration (other than physical) stated about each other.    And my friend, who also struggled through this book, told me, \\"hang in there...the second book is a bit better.\\"  Sooooo, I borrowed the second book.  Started it at 9pm Friday night, read for an hour.  I actually got through half the book because the more I skipped, the more I noticed I was just getting through the book, and not missing a single thing. I did NOT need to continue to hear about their sex life.  It is established that they like having sex, they enjoy each other physically, they orgasm A LOT, and every orgasm is better than the last.  I caught on so quickly that Elena was going to be a major problem...    I'm stopping this review, as I feel I am getting as repetitive as the book was.  Sorry, thumbs down (though a thumb on the clitoris is supposed to be stimulating, according to this book).
B000OP1M6M|5.0|I have the version of this watch Seiko made 20 years ago.  Still works, HOWEVER it has one flaw; it gains 5 minutes a week since the day I bought it.  NO, I did not send it back as I didn't want the factory seal broken.  Now here is the fantastic element about this watch: It is virtually indestructible.  Because it is large there is a tendency to \\"hit\\" things as you are walking by them.  I have hit steel door frames and this watch just keeps on ticking with no damage whatsoever.  I have had many diving watches in this price category and I am completely sold on Seiko Diving watches.  Would I buy another one?  ABSOLUTELY.  But so far, I haven't had call to replace the one I have. Oh yes, I get a lot of compliments on this watch...a LOT of compliments.  NOTE:  If you have never worn a watch like this please know it is \\"heavy\\"; it is not a light watch.  It's also thick so long sleeve shirts can get \\"hung-up\\" on the watch and not cover it when you move around.  For dressy days I have a thiner Seiko watch.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|I had swiftkey x and it was perfect. But now with 3 the key are all bigger and the small size is way too small. I want my small type back! Don't know if dev can get back to this because amazon app store sucks, but if you can that would be great.
B007XH6BPG|4.0|I'm not a mindless fanboy of either Hackett or Squire, but I've certainly loved plenty of work they've both contributed to, and I have a couple solo pieces from Hackett as well as Squire's \\"Fish Out of Water\\" which I've enjoyed.  That being said, I do tend to think with both bands, Yes and Genesis, the whole is much greater than the sum of the parts, in spite and because of some strong \\"part contributions\\" from Hackett and Squire to both outfits in their 70s prime.<br /><br />And this disc?<br /><br />NOT a super proggy masterpiece here (at all really), but definitely an enjoyable and interesting (and safe) group of songs by two respectable old progger musicians.  Nicely put together, recorded, engineered, and mastered tunes highlighting some agreeable compositions that sort of have (apart from the afore-mentioned Zep vibe on a couple tunes) an 80s rock feel as well.  Drum sound is \\"80's big\\" and fairly simple kick-snare in a lot of places, and the keyboards are subtly 80's as well (reminded me of the sound of Dire Straits' \\"Brothers in Arms\\" in a few places).<br /><br />Positives<br />** Nice melodies - hummable with catchy choruses<br />** Some VERY interesting Hackett leads and solos.  He's one of the few older proggers who can still kick out some very inventive and energetic leads.  This seriously makes me think I need to check out more of his catalog from the last decade<br />** Vocals are nice and both voices blend exceptionally well.  BUT, they're almost TOO nice in places, which leads to...<br /><br />Negatives<br />** For my tastes, the vocals are TOO unobtrusive and soft in places.  Squire usually has a very distinctive voice even doing backup vox, but in plenty of places in the disk, both voices just seem too subtle.  BUT, this is really a very slight negative<br />** There was a nice mellow vibe in the disk, but I found myself wanting a little more energy in a few of the numbers.  Some of Hackett's guitar work makes up for it with little bursts of energyhere and there, which helps, but not as much as I would have liked<br />** That 80s vibe.  Again, this is only a slight negative for me as you can see I still gave it 4 stars<br /><br />Neither Here nor There's<br /><br />** Lyrics.  If I paid more attention to them and the voices were more prominent, I might have found this a negative, but to be honest, I hardly noticed them one way or the other.  They seem to fit that whole unobtrusive, nice, mellow feel for the disk<br /><br />I think kind of like David Gilmour's \\"On an Island\\" a few years ago, this disk feels like a nice, mellow-vibed disk where the musicians didn't really have anything to prove, and they mostly did it because they enjoyed it.  At least that's the feeling I'm taking away from it.  If you like more of an 80s rock vibe to your music (I usually don't I admit), and still like a touch of what Hackett and Squire bring to a tune, you'll probably like this as well.
B0084IG7KC|3.0|Why did this movie remind me of another movie that was made years before the book was written and twelve years before the movie was made....the movie I talk about it \\"Battle Royale.\\" Because I could not get over that fact, I gave the movie three stars. Although an excellent movie, it can never live up to Battle Royale. Im still going to get the movie so that must say something....

B006QVRVJK|5.0|...despite his, er, private behavior, but gah! What awful people. Yes, it was funny in a very, very unpleasant way, but I think I watched it with an expression of horrified disgust pasted to my face. Don't we all know people like this? Completely tense, unable to stop the diarrhea of boring small talk about cobbler recipes and toilet parts while their restrained hostility growls audibly below the polite chatter? I felt like taking a hot bath after watching this. Yes, and becoming a hermit in a cave somewhere so I'd never have to see a human being again.<br /><br />I will never, ever watch this movie again; it was like fingernails on a blackboard to me. And yet it was a great movie. I saw no flaw in the acting or direction. There was an ugly fascination in seeing how four people could all be arrogant bourgeois thugs, yet so different. Four different shades of awful.<br /><br />I loved the hilarious irony of the scene in the park as the credits roll. You could almost miss it, but it beautifully sums up the ludicrousness of the situation that has just played out between the four adults.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I loved this book, this was a great story, the characters  were amazing. There were times that I laughed at pidge  and times I wanted to kill Travis! This story gives you so many emotions. makes you feel how Pidge feels every time Travis screws up.  Draws you in and won't let you go. Leaves you wanting more. I will definitely read this book again.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Just from reading the reviews here, I was appalled at what is considered a good book by enough people to make this a best seller.  We must be shedding frontal cortex cells by the trillions for this kind of claptrap to make it into best seller-hood.

B003K8MI4K|5.0|This is David Tennant's last season and its a good one.  From the beginning with Donna coming back join the Doctor and the little fat babies to the very end with the Medusa Cascade.  I was worried that Donna being the companion would mix well but I came to like her as much as the others.  Her not being in love with the Doctor was a nice change from the past two (Rose and Martha) as it really felt like two friends on an adventure.
B004FGMDOQ|2.0|the book is good, but you can but it down and not be anxious to get back to it. alittle slow. interesting. probably would not recommend itto a friend.
B004XS97KO|5.0|I wasn't a big fan of last season (season 5).  The overall story didn't impress me as the older seasons did and Matt Smith didn't feel like he was being himself.<br />This season I enjoyed it a lot more.  From the beginning the story had me hooked. The Silence was a new and interesting villian.  Matt Smith seemed more comfortable with being the Doctor this season and he didn't feel like he was trying to be David Tennant (my favorite doctor).<br />I felt like the season the story was better planned out unlike last season and was happy with the twist at the end. I can't wait for the next season.<br /><br />If you felt the season 5 was missing something this season you should like more.
B001JI8IJW|5.0|The movie is still excellent, picture is slightly better on blu ray than dvd and the sound seemed to be much better.
0345803485|5.0|The book arrived on time! Once I started reading it I absolutely could not put it down! I immediately had to order the other two books and was annoyed with myself for not just buying them all at once.
B004LROUW2|5.0|I loved this book. It took about a hundred pages to get hooked, but after that it was addictive. Great story with a surreal sci-fi bent. Simple situations are explained with depth.  You know how everyone feels in a scene because you have had that same feeling.  Murakami has created such interesting characters, I was sorry to see them go by books end.
0345803485|1.0|First thing I did after I finished reading the book - look up the publisher.  You think I'm kidding?  Nope, not one bit.  I did it because I truly think it's such a disgrace to print this so-called \\"writing\\" when many other truly talented authors' works never get to see their writings dance in black ink on pages after pages.  So when I found out that Vintage is actually a big name publisher in the U.K., I laughed... a lot.<br /><br />Okay, it's not ALL bad.  So I'll start with the good.<br />+ I commend her for writing erotica.  Personally, I have never read an novel in this genre, and I only did because I heard all the hype about it.  So for being bold and having the courage to write in a very foreign genre and gaining a massive following, kudos to Ms. James.<br />+ Thank you, Ms. James, for letting all the innocent 21-year-olds out there know that despite our inexperience, some rich billionaire might still be taken with us and sweep us ordinary girls-next-door off our feet.  Oh I'm sorry, not just a billionaire.  He also happens to be a pilot, pianist, wants to solve world hunger, and is willing to lavish me with hard-to-find first edition books and Audi's.  I'll be \\"falling\\" into many billionaire's offices now.  Thank you very much for the tip!<br /><br />I'm sorry, that's all the good I can think of...<br /><br />Now the negatives (and there are so many!)<br />- Personally, I think it is extremely hard to write in a first person POV.  Rarely have I seen it done well (example: Catcher in the Rye)  However, if the overall story line is decent, I can often look past what I think is not a very good first-person narrative writing (example: The Hunger Games).  I'm sorry, Ms. James, I cannot look past this one.  Why do I think Holden Caulfield's POV is acceptable?  Because I think it can get tedious being inside the mind of one character for 300, 400 pages.  However, Holden goes through massive character development throughout the book, so it is interesting.  ANASTAIA STEELE on the other hand, does not.  You have to agree with me, reading about her orgasms after orgasms can be such a turn off.  I used to just hate the word \\"moist\\", but now I also hate \\"flushed\\", \\"murmur\\", and \\"goddess\\".<br />- I have not read the other 2 books of the trilogy, nor do I intend to.  Because quite frankly, after Chapter 10, I see Ms. James running out of material.  So she just keeps repeating sex scene after sex scene.  Now, it would be interesting plot changes if they were set up differently.  But leading up to the sex, it is always because A) Ana bites her lips, B) Ana upsets Christian in some way (i.e. rolled her eyes).  It got so tedious to the point that I started skipping a lot of the sex scenes in the book, because do I really want to repeat 10 pages of bad writing every time they have sex?  I think not.<br />- I have to ask... is any of this supposed to turn me on?  Because if that was the intent of Ms. James, she has failed miserably.  Those who know me call me \\"the destroyer of love\\", mainly because I mock all things romance.  Well, all things romance that is overly cheesy and unrealistic.  Take me to a rom com, and I'll be the obnoxious girl laughing her way through all of the cheesy lines.  Same thing here, I laughed so hard while reading that my mom thought I was reading Calvin & Hobbes.  True story.<br /><br />I hear that people are rooting for Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart to play Christian and Ana, respectively, for the movie adaptation.  I really hope they do.  After the Twilight saga ends, I need something to laugh at.STEELE on the other hand, does not.  You have to agree with me, reading about her orgasms after orgasms can be such a turn off.

B007JM4CWY|3.0|The puzzles are fun to work, but when you get to larger (15x20 or so), the squares are too small to tap accurately with a finger.  In fact, they are even hard to tap with a small stylus pen.<br /><br />Smaller puzzles are OK, but not nearly as challenging.
B007PS0X0W|5.0|The movie is an excellent addition to the series. Beckinsale is still outstanding as the heroine. My son and I like to watch movies like this in series and will watch them back-to-back-to-back because we like to see the continuity and how parts from the past are brought back as one story. This latest chapter fits well.
0439023513|3.0|I enjoyed the Hunger Games and Catching Fire very much!<br />But, have to confess that Mockingjay let me down.<br />While the twist at the end was mildly interesting I was really set for an epic battle between Katniss and President Snow somewhere in the Capital.<br />Nope, she wakes up in the hospital for the 500th time it seems.<br />Agree with some other reviewers, major characters just die off with little to no details.<br />Of all the three books I felt book 3 was the best suited to be in the teen reading section of the book store............
B005723JSQ|5.0|I actually listened to the audiobook from audible.  It was narrated very well.  The story was very good.  Light-hearted and adorable, but still makes you cheer for the characters.  I found myself laughing and smiling a lot.  Would definitely recommend for anyone.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|The relation between sex and power is undeniable but obscure. This book fudges it by pretending that that the two are easily reconciled in relatively harmless and restrained forms. We all know that both sex and power soon become boring at any level, and that there is always an impulse to push them further.What saves most of us from pushing too far is that love and friendship are more rewarding and less threatening.

B005723JSQ|4.0|This book was such a fun read.  My first by Kinsella but not my last.  The main character did crazy (in my book) things but not so when I think of some of my friends... First she loses her engagement ring which has been in her fiance's family...made my stomach flop.  Then she gets her phone stolen and finds a replacement in the trash which brings on more complications because it is owned by a firm. Don't want to go any further but the read was enjoyably FUN.  The twists and turns will give you many smiles if not some chuckles...and yes a few laugh out louds for sure!

B003AKLFAG|5.0|Chan-Wook's Oldboy is one of the best psychological-revenge thrillers ever made, in my honest opinion. It's a dark, stylish tale of revenge and just how far it can go. It has immersive dialogue and amazing fist fights. The dark story leads to a jaw-dropping conclusion filled with twists and turns; some may not be psychologically prepared for the epicly twisted ending. No other ending has affected me the way Oldboy's did. The music is amazing from beginning to end, and the acting was superb. Oldboy is a truly flawless film and a must-see for fans of film in general, not just fans of South Korean films.<br /><br />Oldboy has vivid violence, strong sexual themes, nudity, a sex scene, and some language. I HIGHLY recommend it.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|The fantasy was an interesting, new tale.  I, however, found it hard to follow through half the book.  The skipping back and forward through the years made it very confusing.  I had to start writing down the characters and year for each chapter to even begin to understand the plot.  That is way too much work for a fantasy book.  About half way through, I was able to actually enjoy the plot.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter tells Abraham Lincoln's story from his childhood to presidency with a vampire-hunting twist. I am not familiar with the source material, other than knowing this film is based on a book, so I won't and can't compare them. Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is an ultra-stylish, action-packed adventure.<br /><br />The story is unique and innovative, packed with thrilling, edge-of-your-seat action sequences and a great yet bizarre \\"what-if\\" twist on history. (If you're not a fan of bizarre creativity, then this film is probably not for you.) There are a lot of slow-motion action which I thought was choreographed perfectly; I personally loved the final action sequence on top of the train where Abe and his childhood friend, William, fight an onslaught of vampires while sharing an axe. Also, this film has a couple of great jump-scares that I didn't expect, since I thought it was a pure action film. I enjoyed Benjamin Walker as young Abe Lincoln, but not so much as the older President Abraham Lincoln due to make-up/effects; the rest of the acting was great. This film oozes style, from the dark, beautifully shot scenery to the breathtaking, blood-splattering slow-motion action pieces; this is one of the film's that you should own on Blu-ray as the picture quality is amazing. Also, the music effectively complimented the film.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed Abraham Lincoln; it's an amazing action film that effectively uses its fantasy concept and settings to its advantage. I recommend purchasing for fans of the action/fantasy genre, and a rental for those still on the edge.<br /><br />Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter has strong violence and blood, some brief sex and nudity.

Highly recommended.

B004G5ZXVQ|5.0|I do not understand the many negative reviews of this recording on this site.  Obviously their music changed throughout their 30 year recording career and will elicit different feelings in the listener now than when said listener was in his or her 20's.  This is a very good record and will give you many hours of listening joy if you give it a chance.  Don't hesitate to buy this!

B003H9MSPG|2.0|This Nerf gun is really cool to look at and put together.  It is a complete joke to shoot.  When you shoot this it makes a most pitiful sound and the dart practically drips out of the barrel.  Whenever people see this Nerf gun they instantly want to play with it.  After firing only a couple of times they invariably come to the same sad realization that I have.  There are better guns made by Nerf for much cheaper.
B00846TTDG|3.0|I put off watching this for a while because most of the reviews I'd read talked about how bad the acting was in it, but decided to watch it this weekend. I didn't think the acting was that bad considering who was doing it.  The action was exciting and made the movie worth watching.  The storyline was very predictable in one area and I knew where it would end up as soon as I saw a few scenes that were obvious set ups for where it was headed, but that was a fairly small part of the movie. The drawback of watching it on instant is no special features and we would really like to see those.<br />But definitely a good pick for a rainy day if you like action movies.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Wasn't sure at first how to work the puzzle pieces. I later realized there was no need to rotate the pieces. I think you are able to chose that feature. I managed to put together some on the beginners level and later progressed to a higher level.  The puzzle pictures are cute and I like it.
B005HSL626|3.0|I have this on my kindle fire and it doesn't load all the way sometimes. it freezes up and really annoys me. the touch sensorwould stop working halfway through the game and exit out. maybe it's just the kindle fire because the free one works just fine on my sisters iPad.
B0086700CM|5.0|I live for this game! great game i rate this five stars myslelf! do get this game, granted the fact that it is free!
B007SK8WJ6|5.0|Mad men us the best theater on tv.  The convenience of down loading this episode to my<br />Kindle to catch up on an episode I missed while traveling is great.  This episode was as entertaining as any other one if this excellent series.  I couldn't miss a single one!

B007XKEY6Q|2.0|something about too many tools added and then it quits. needs updates!!! you keep updating the mobile version but ignore the kindle one... get on the ball!!!!
1451608659|4.0|I was excited to get a behind-the-scenes look into the life of an elite gymnast in this memoir. Moceanu takes us through her life, from her birth and early years, to her first gym, to her experiences training at the (in)famous Karolyi ranch, her family difficulties, the Olympics, and her life after the Olympics. She writes in an open and honest style, and has the ability to discuss some of the worst parts of her life with a mature outlook that lacks bitterness. Interspersed throughout the book are chapters on discovering and meeting a long-lost sister, who had been given up at birth by her parents.<br /><br />I appreciated learning much more about what it takes to train at the elite level and the uglier side of training with two well-known gymnastics coaches. When you watch gymnasts on television, they make everything look so easy that it's hard to remember all the sacrifices that are made to be an Olympic-gymnast, from training through injuries to giving up normal childhood food.  Moceanu's descriptions of the Karolyi's made a particular impression, and I admire her for getting through that experience. Additionally, I also found the story of her Jennifer, her long-lost sister, particularly inspiring - I would love to see a memoir by her as well! Finally, I liked the pictures that were included in the middle of the book, showing her family and some of her famous gymnastics moments.<br /><br />I would recommend this memoir to anyone who follows gymnastics or who is interested in athlete autobiographies.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|do I even have to explain I mean amazing. its so cool. I really recalomend it. it has so many games. soccer hockey and curling.

B005OCFHHK|5.0|Item is above expectations and arrived sooner than expected. Not the norm in this world so I was pleasantly surprised... perfect!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|50 Shades of Gray is a beautiful love story.  Lots of vivid sex, described in detail, but tactfully written.  It keeps your interest, easy reading, and well written.  The type of book you don't want to put down.
0345803485|1.0|I ordered this book after hearing about it on tv and reading some reviews. WHAT A GIGANTIC WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME ! I felt like I was reading one of those books that's just fluff . Harlequin with BDMS thrown in. I hoped the ending Ana getting the job she wanted and her being independent and unscathed by her brush with Grey. Will I read the next two books from the trilogy? Not even if I got them for free! Jeez...oh my!
B005T87QCI|2.0|so your sitting there at the end when your about to win a match and it says rip and every time I click that it never rips.and also every time I am trying to hit and it never hits.I don't get this app its just a wast of money
B007B8GI28|5.0|Okay, so I know a lot of people felt like the beginning of the season was dragging, but the writers know what they are doing.  They need to build story lines and let us in on what the characters are really thinking.  They can't always be fighting off zombies.  If that's all there was to this show, I wouldn't watch it.  That's what makes it a good show and not cheesy zombie crap. Not only do they need to be afraid of the dead, but they also need to be careful when they come across the living.  That's what makes this show so good. I started watching this on Netflix, but they didn't have season 2.  Luckily, Amazon did, and for a small price.  Go Amazon!!! Can't wait for season 3 in July!
1451648537|5.0|Everybody who reads this book is enthusiastic about the depth and frankness of the story it tells about Steve Jobs's life: how honest it is, since Jobs gave the author permission to write whatever he wanted to without Jobs's approval, even without Jobs reading the book. Indeed it calls out for such honesty, because Steve Jobs was a complex, fascinating, and extremely unpleasant person, who sustained obvious psychological damage from being given up for adoption by his birth parents--and also a genius.<br />Isaacson seems to go inside the story--he himself is a genius, in my opinion--telling about the numerous staff meetings in which Jobs regularly savaged his staff, calling their work \\"shit\\" and later on, taking credit for those ideas that survived. Jobs would have been a very difficult person to work with (or live with, naturally); but somehow he managed to surround himself with people who did his bidding and went on to produce ingenious products. He really did build an A team. Interestingly, Isaacson doesn't think Jobs was exceptionally smart; but, he says, Jobs was a genius, because he followed his intuition and it led to sensationally successful products--and the company, and the brand--and a cult following of Apple users.<br />The fact that Jobs was a sociopath makes the story all that much more interesting, because instead of rendering him an outcast, it helped propel him to greatness. I was gratified to read that he was allowed to attend my alma mater, Reed College, in his own outside-the-rules fashion, attending only the classes that interested him, not paying tuition, and leaving when it suited him.<br />I very much like Jobs's idea of the crossroads of technology and the humanities intersecting, and the aesthetic vision he pushed so hard, and successfully, to achieve. Even his impatience with mediocrity was understandable. But it's a shame he was such an unpleasant person. The conundrum is, were the two necessarily intertwined: the genius visionary with nearly-impossible standards, and the social tyrant?
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game. I earned so many coins through running I have bought every upgrade on the first day. My highscore is:<br />  1.5 million points<br />  2753 coins<br />  5768 meters<br />  If you beat me tell me your score.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I have enjoyed using this app. I have had it on my Kindle Fire for a few months and have had no problems so far.
B000SLP4SE|4.0|Although this was a great action movie -- probably the best sniper movie out there -- I didn't see any mention of this in all the reviews that I read so far:  This was a parable for 9/11, and the story lays out how our government was possibly involved in, if not orchestrated, the 9/11 tragedy.<br /><br />[SPOILER ALERT]:  At the beginning of the movie, when Swagger (Mark Walburg's character) returns home, you see a copy of the 9/11 report next to his computer, which sets the tone of the movie.  Some of the defining moments of the movie are when the wheelchair-bound Checzk character lays it out there in his face-to-face with Swagger:  Nothing happens in any country without the knowledge and consent of people in power.  Also, Ned Beatty's Senator Meachum sums it all up:  There is no Sunni and Shia, Democrats and Republicans, it's just haves and have-not, and the haves do what they have to do to keep the perpetual war machine going, because it's what the people want , and it's good for democracy (according to Senator Meachum, anyway). Danny Glover's character (he's acted better in other movies -- Lethal Weapon comes to mind) is the ultimate behind-the-scene bad guy, and you get a pretty good sense of if the government was involved, how it might come about, through his actions.<br /><br />If you haven't done so, go back and watch the movie again, not just because it's a great action movie (Swagger and the girl never hook up -- not even a kiss), but to see the big picture about 9/11 and how our government probably knew about it, if they weren't directly involved.  In the movie, it's about cover-up of massacred civilians in Africa to build and protect an oil pipeline, but in reality, it's all about 9/11.  Also, check out the documentary \\"Zeitgeist\\", which is an amazing work on piecing together the aftermath of 9/11, among other topics.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Hubby has been waiting for this album and was grateful to receive the morning of our 6 hr drive to Florida.  So we kicked off the vacation with a thorough listen to Clockwork Angels. Three kids, who would rather listen to Rush than [pick any current pop singer], give it a thumbs up, as do I. Husband gives a solid, enthusiastic thumbs up. Other reviewers have given a good play-by-play for each song, so no need to repeat. I would just add that it is refreshing to hear new \\"real\\" music - that is, actual instruments, instead of computers in a studio, and incredibly talented artists who play music, instead of dancing with a cadre of stage dancers.  I like Rush, but would not consider myself the devotee my husband is. But I find this album very \\"fresh\\" but at the same time, entirely consistent with the intricacy, musicianship, and quality that Rush has always delivered. I don't think you'll be disappointed with this purchase.
B007PS0X0W|2.0|This turned out to be a nothing show. Very little plot, not really much action either.  I regret that I paid for instant video rather than waiting for the Redbox (only worth a dollar)
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This set has great picture quality and sound. Original episodes, IV-VI, remastered very nicely.....big difference from the DVD set. Good Job!
1466401885|5.0|I ordered this book and finished it in 2 and a half days. the only reason it took me that long was because i have kids and had to keep stopping inbetween... if not i wouldve finished the 1st day! its a page turner and addicting book... i felt as if i was watching a movie in head.. its a AWESOME BOOK!!! i totally recommend it!!!! ROMANTIC AND JUST SOOOOOO GOOD!! cant wait for part 2!!!! well written!
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|does not work on android impression. sucks cuz i love these birds! seasons is the only one that stays on. this and space d/l and install but force close and dont run
B001E45XT4|3.0|I bought this headset when it was on discount. and am very happy with it considering that i bought it for 60% less.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1- Good Mic<br />2- durable<br />3- It got cushions on the top of the headset for your head.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1- This is a gaming headset but yet the sound when connected is perfect for healing actual people talk ( using skype for example) but disappointment when hearing the game sounds. ( might be better when used AMP)<br />2- The Ear cushions are great but they isolate your ears and might be worm inside since it blocks all air coming.<br /><br />Overall this is a good product only if u cant afford to get something better, if u can get more bucks, squeeze your self and get something little bit better for sound quality purpose.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|great app for playing around with ur photos .  lots of choices for tweaking.  its not for the photoshop expert.  its for the average Joe that likes some of the cool effects of photoshop,  but without the learning curve!
B006GKHE6G|4.0|My daughter accidentally wrote a review for this product, and it was just a bunch of gibberish, so I had to edit this. I haven't played this game, so I don't know about it. But she has it on her Kindle, and loves to play it.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|Shane : your  have got to play this game it is awesome! this game you find it on the top of the app store.
0307887448|5.0|... Most of the 80s references were over my head. (before my time) Still loved it, the only downside I see to this book is I now want a gaming system just like that lol. Sure, there were some parts that made me roll my eyes, but this is the authors FIRST book. I read (part of) this on a six hour road trip, kinda wanted to keep going so I could finish it! First for me, cause I hate car rides.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Very entertaining! Some games are repeats,  just different versions.Takes a lot of space, because of all the games. Still great! Good for kids and adults.
B004ZISVWC|4.0|This movie is quite possibly one of the weirdest movies I've ever seen. It is quite dry and predictable in parts then goes completely nuts just because they can. It may be obvious but the troll hunter character is just plain weird. I am horrified any govt agency would allow him to use a firearm.<br /><br />All in all, not a waste of my time, but probably could have found something better. But I will give the movie mad props for having the tie in to real life at the end. :)
B007D2XSW0|3.0|When I tried to use focal point and try to move it to extenuate a focal point...it goes back to default position...
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I hadn't read to much about these books before I read them and I was surprised, to say the least. The first half of the book I kept blushing and making sure nobody was watching me read it. But at some point you get over that, or at least I did and you get sucked into the story. I was kind of annoyed that the characters were similar to the Twilight-characters, only without the whole supernatural thing.. But i guess that's what you get when you write fanfiction... I did like the book and i've recommended it to some of my friends, partly because i'm curious what they will think about it and partly because i think other people might like it. It is a nice distraction from my own life and even though it wasn't the best written book i've ever read, it was entertaining to say the least.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game don't know why but I cant quit playing it lol<br />get it and you will love it also just like I do.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|After i finished the first book of this series i immediately started the second one. The sex part was still hot, but Christian changed very quickly, it was a little too quickly. And i still didn't like Ana, she's just annoying, she is so much like Bella from twilight! If you liked the twilight characters and think you will still like them if they're not supernatural, than go for it, you will probably like the story. But if you want to read this just because of the sex, i would say it's a bit expensive! i mean, the sex part is good, but 10,09 dollars?
B00884GR0W|5.0|disclaimer this is not minecrsft this is an rpg game whither over 90 mobs amazing you should get this app
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|I was a fan of this book, I thought the novel had multiple meanings. Although the end was surprising, it's nice to have a different ending. I enjoyed it, thanks Mr. Sparks
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so cool that I think it would be so awesome in 3D or 4D nut I love the game
B004SIP6LS|5.0|You ever deeply contemplate what it would be like to work at a Quick Stop or a video store? Well reflect on this deep rooted concept no more: here is Clerks. It is really hard to explain how awesome this film is. Clerks was the first feature film directed by Kevin Smith. It was the voice of a generation and the beginning of an era: slacker cinema.  The plot couldn't be more simple and the dialogue couldn't be more genius.  The story follows the average day of a guy who gets called in to work on his day off.  He has to go in and he hates it. That pretty much sums up the entire movie.  Kevin Smith's uncanny ability to make this unfortunate turn of events seem interesting and funny is nothing short of amazing. There is a zen like quality to the conversations that take place in this film.  There are probably over a 1000 lines in Clerks that will be quoted for a very long time. Which quote is the best and what does it even mean? That is totally up to each individual person that takes the time to watch this movie. If you love this film (and you should) that means one thing: you are alive and you have a very healthy sense of humor. It is important to note that this film was shot for $27,575 in the convenience store where director Kevin Smith worked in real life. It went on to gross over $3 million in theaters and launched Smith's career.  it goes to show that good writing and a little bit of realism can go a long way.<br /><br />Hey, I'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class, especially since I rule.
0345803485|5.0|I have heard so many different peoples reactions to this trilogy... some say it's not very well written and blah blah! I will tell you this... I read about 20 pages and was so hooked! I read the whole trilogy in just a couple weeks and I DO NOT read fast what so ever.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I thought the game may be like the old computer game,  I used to play as a kid. It isn't. But is equally fun.
0345525558|5.0|I  completely fall in love with this lovely book! It is a great, emotionally and touching novel. Victoria was not an easy character to understand but she was also so much sensitive and sweet. She is solitary just because she desperatly needs love and affection. I was really fascinated by the secret meaning of flowers. It was a pleasure to read it!
B0058YPG2K|3.0|This is hands down the best show on tv. Great acting. Great writing. Great stories. The only problem with this set is that for some reason they decided not to burn in the subtitles when people are speaking Spanish. So any time a conversation begins in Spanish you have to grab the remote, hit rewind, then turn the English subtitles on. If you leave it on all the time you get English subtitles for all of the English that is spoken throughout the show rather than just the foreign language.  There is no foreign language only subtitle track, just a complete subtitle track and another complete subtitle track that adds descriptive information for the hearing impared. It's pretty ridiculous, and an obvious mistake. This season has a lot of Spanish in it, so it is a bit of a hassle. I honestly can't remember any other show or movie having this issue since the early days of DVD, let alone on a Blu-ray. So it's a pretty crazy screw up on their part. It is possible that this is just an issue on the Playstation 3 I use for blurays (don't have another player to test it on), but as that is just about the most popular player in the world it's not an acceptable problem.<br /><br />After an Internet search I found that it isn't an issue just for the PS3. There is a fix (but really, should we need to have to fix something like this?). After you start watching the show pull up the menu while the show is playing. Go to subtitles and turn on the English subtitles - not the English SDH subtitles. Then exit from the menu to the already playing show. Then pull up the menu AGAIN, go to subtitles, then choose no subtitles. Then you can exit the menu and only the foreign languages will be subtitled. This will have to be done any time you change discs.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Holy Mother of Pearl - I became an avid reader only about 10 years ago. Only within the last year have I dared to start to read books such as 50 shades. I must say it is some of the WORST writing I have ever had the pleasure of reading. From a literary point of view it is some the worst print I have seen. The writer must us copy and paste when ideas run out. The first 9 chapter were horrible. It was like reading the dialogue of 2 middle school girls about a cute guy at school....you talk to him, no you talk to him, I already talked to him it's your turn to talk to him...he's so hot....you talk to him ....and on on on it goes. Then things start to heat up and the sex scenes are interesting to say the least...maybe sparking a few ideas of my own. But where is the relationship that should be developing among the characters? There are a few scenes that make me feel for Ana and some that want me to slap the dom out of Christian but over all I don't know about the writer's ability and where is the editor in all of this??? I would describe 50 shades as delicious, addicting, but terrible writing. The only reason I will continue with this series is moral support for Ana (I know she isn't real) and I just want to know what happens to them and hoping for a happily ever after ending....?
1400052181|5.0|Great book! I had been looking forward to reading it. Intriguing scientific facts and the family's story is compelling as well.
B0061S073A|3.0|This app was downloaded for my sons kindle.  It is definitely more geared for a cell.  By using this app kids cannot access the ebooks which is the priority function for my son.  It would only allow him access to the apps which are mostly games.  I could see how this would be a beneficial app for a phone since mostly all you want your kids to be able to access are the apps.  I gave this app three stars mainly because I don't use for its primary device (phone) but I could see how it has potential. I am deleting it from my sons ereader.
B008469DGY|4.0|fun and addictive. I would recommend this game. it doesn't. try to keep getting money from you after you pay.
B008COII1Y|1.0|This movie was unintentionally hilarious. From the non-stop, over-the-top rage screams of the main character, to the cheesy music, to the random, meaningless flashbacks, it was really, really bad. I will say the zombie makeup was quite good, and the countryside and sets would have added an interesting texture to the movie, if the movie didn't induce eye-bleeding in all who watched it. I thoroughly enjoyed myself until halfway through \\"Chapter 2\\" (yes, \\"Chapter 2!\\"), when I started getting sleepy and thought, surely, this must be over soon. Nope! I was only 25 minutes into a 2 hour movie. Save yourselves!<br /><br />I appreciate that this movie must have been made by a novice, and probably very young director. We all have to start somewhere. But I recommend not renting this one. Better luck next time, young'un.
0671027344|5.0|This book has every element possible, it's a trip full of emotions and one can easily get identified with the main character, Charlie
B005VPRET4|3.0|This set was extremely easy to build, but it will be frustrating for some for playtime, as things like the accessories are so teeny tiny (and there are what seems like a zillion accessories). For example the cash register comes with money, but good luck in trying to get the money out! Same with the oven and the pan, the ice cream machine spouts kept falling off, the characters hair won't stay on... My daughters also really got frustrated with the cupcakes as the small round pieces don't snap in and keep falling out. All in all, it's a very cute set but I am wishing now that I would have went with something non-lego that was a little more sturdier and easier for playing with.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is a pretty good game everything goes fast. looking forward to completing more adventures. graffics are also very good
0142420891|5.0|Thank you to Smash for recommending this series! While I really liked If I Stay, I LOVED Where She Went. Adam is one of the best male characters I've read, and the author made an excellent decision to write the story from his point of view.<br /><br />*This review is spoilerish so if you haven't read If I Stay, you should stop now.*<br /><br />Adam Wilde is a 21 year-old rock star sensation, living out his dream of becoming a wildly successful musician. However, he's jaded and morose. His fame and money mean nothing to him because he's missing the most important part of his life: Mia.<br /><br />Three years ago, Mia let their relationship end without a word why. Granted, she was messed up after losing her family in a horrible car crash, but I was angry with her for never providing an explanation to Adam. He was gutted after losing her family AND her. After holing up in his parents' basement for months, he wrote a heartbreaking CD for his band, which elevated Shooting Star to the stratosphere (think Britney Spears fame).<br /><br />What's your favorite breakup CD? I'm partial to Chris Isaak's Forever Blue, Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill, and of course Adele's 21. Adam's lyrics were my favorite part of the story. Gorgeous and devastating all at once:<br /><br />I'll be your mess, you be mine<br />That was the deal that we had signed<br />I bought a hazmat suit to clean up your waste<br />Gas masks, gloves, to keep us safe<br />But now I'm alone in an empty room<br />Staring down immaculate doom<br /><br />and<br /><br />There's a piece of lead where my heart should be<br />Doctor said too dangerous to take out<br />You'd better just leave it be<br />Body grew back around it, a miracle, praise be,<br />Now, if only I could get through airport security<br /><br />I want to buy this CD Collateral Damage!<br /><br />Some of my favorite psychotherapy clients are young adult/new adult men because they try so damn hard to be tough and strong but they have vulnerabilities just like the rest of us. It can be immensely cathartic for them to express those feelings, and this novel is like one big therapy session for Adam. Adam is so sweet--I just want to hug him--especially when he thinks things like this:<br /><br />Mia's grandfather just looked at me in that quiet sad way that made me inexplicably want to kneel at the foot of his chair and put my head in his lap.<br /><br />*sobs* You'll make it Adam, hang in there!<br /><br />This book is a tearjerker but in a touching, satisfying way. Highly recommended!
B005ZUR724|4.0|Could be better but.... It is pretty great. For a Kindle Fire app it is  very good however does have some drawbacks:<br />1. Price. If you are gonna charge 99 cents a month for a game,  why make it cost 6.99? I will agree that is cheap,  however if you want more people to pay for more months or more purchases of the game,  use one or the other.<br />2. Chat. Sometimes it's good,  other times it is horrendous. Sometimes people are just mean.<br />And 3. Gameloft in general. I have heard bad things about them and their bad customer support. This kind of thing always worries me.ESPECIALLY on an expensive game like this.<br />Other then those things,  it seems like a great game. Enjoy!
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|It basically felt like the author ran out of steam.<br /><br />Suddenly, Katniss finds herself caught up in a revolution that she neither understands nor can instinctively navigate. This sweeps the entire story into a sort of sci-fi techno gray zone (which leads to all sorts of questions about the evolution of Panem), where Katniss is portrayed as a sort of superhero and whereby there are huge leaps from one stage of the 'revolution' to the next. Snow is pure evil, Peeta has been brainwashed to hate Katniss, Katniss is turned into a propaganda weapon, Katniss has no idea what she wants or who she wants to be with, people die left and right (for no apparent reason, including the rebel leader Coin and Prim), the rebels march on the Capitol (unclear how) and sub-plots push each other constantly to the periphery.<br /><br />My firm impression is that the first book was in many ways great at struggle and character development, the second was a weak attempt to reinvent portions of the first book (another round of games, leading inexplicably to a rebel district 13 that is technologically advanced and armed to the teeth) and the third book was a really weak attempt to reach closure on the entire effort.<br /><br />I am honestly not sure that it was worth my time to have read all 3.
B00785P2QC|5.0|awesome cool great fun amazing wow I love it it is really cool try it now it is sweet cool awesome and amazing
B0086700CM|5.0|awesome that's what it is.temple run is addicting and I love it if I had a penny for every time I've played that game I privily would be rich.
B0083B3KOQ|4.0|I bought this ap to convert a bunch of ebooks I have on my computer and it fine. It was fast and the files were usable after converting them. I have not yet tried to convert any other files.
0765316994|5.0|I could summarize the plot of this novel in a short paragraph, but I won't because if I did, you won't have the \\"Oh, that's different\\" experiences I had reading it, and I quite enjoyed them. I wouldn't want to ruin those for you.<br />At one level, this is obviously a parody of Star Trek, The Original Series, told from the perspective of the poor unfortunate crewmembers sent on away missions for the sole purpose of dying in interesting and dramatic ways to advance the plot. As such, it's a hoot. It has aliens, space travel, split realities, and inexplicable tech stuff. It also has additional layers that make it more than a comic ride through the galaxy aboard the Universal Union Spaceship 'Intrepid'. These layers provide depth and make this a solid, thought provoking read. But even with all the philosophical and existential brain-bending, it is still a lighthearted and charming book.<br />When I started reading this, it reminded me of the movie Galaxy Quest. Then it became more like Star Trek IV. Then it turned a corner and seemed a bit like the Thursday Next books (by Jasper Fforde) with maybe a touch of The Never Ending Story. (Yes, I confess to being something of a geek, but who else would be reading stuff like this?) My point is that there is more than one story being told in this novel. It's rather like a thought experiment in novel form. I loved it.<br />The story has interesting, likeable characters, witty dialogue, and a very Star Trek-like setting. But if you're looking for a mindless action adventure with a few jokes, this isn't for you. If you're looking for a simple slapstick parody of Star Trek, this isn't it. It is also nothing like Scalzi's Old Man Goes to War books (which are also very good) or even Fuzzy Nation (also a winner for me). Scalzi continues to grow as a writer, and this book proves it. I won't say it's better than his other books, but it is definitely different. What I will say is that I thought is was so good I wish I wrote it.

B0015AARJI|2.0|I purchased these dualshock controllers, because my old ones were sticking at the analog stick, or on the buttons. so I was due for a new pair, I play First Person Shooters a lot. I got these when they were due to ship (although I was a bit worried by another review) They looked pristine and I couldn't have been happier, I charged them overnight and the next day set out to retire my old controllers. It was then that I became disappointed, the life of the battery was longer for my old ones and the new controllers we having to constantly be reconnected with the system. I tried resetting them. To get them to work because I figure perhaps it is the way in which I had the ps3 recognize it. Still had the same issue. I would rather go to game stop and buy new controllers than put up with this again.
B0067AC5KA|2.0|Most of the time when I read a book and then watch the movie I am greatly disappointed in the movie that lacks the details that only a book can provide. In this case, it was the opposite. I watched the movie \\"Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" and then read the book. I really enjoyed the movie which is what prompted me to read the book. The book had way to much detail and at times rambled on about things that weren't necessary to the story line, I finished the book after debating if I should just call it quits. It was okay but not anything that I would rave about or even recommend. I went on to read \\"The Girl who Played with Fire\\" just because I had the entire trilogy and thought things might get better. Well the second trilogy is worse than the first. More than 1/4 through the book and it hadn't even touched the main story. Instead describing all kind of nonsense such as a book the main character is reading on math that goes on for pages, travel to the Caribbean, blah blah blah. And here I am still waiting for the main plot. I ended up watching the Swedish version of the movie \\"Girl who played with Fire\\" from Netflicks and enjoyed that much more than the book! Needless to say, I am not continuing with the trilogy. There are much better books out there that I want to read and will no longer waste my time on this nonsense. Instead I picked up bio on Henrietta Lack which I have began reading yesterday and immediately started enjoying without having to wait for the main storyline to take place half way through the book. Proof that real life is better than fiction.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great trilogy - loved how quickly it was downloaded to my Kindle Fire.  The price was great too.  Will order from Amazon again - great service.
B003ASLJO0|4.0|This is a great movie to show Hmong culture and the role gangs play.  It also depicts the generational struggles that occur in families.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|Buy this soundtrack! I had my reservations about Tom Cruise singing, but this is just fan-bloody-tastic! Have just seen the movie, and it has changed my opinion of him completely.<br /><br />This is all the good bits of the 80's mixed up and spat out for some good, fun, rock n roll.
B005HWUCMC|1.0|This was the first CD that I purchased from Amazon and it is now my last.I purchased it because it was cheaper than Best buys and Target. IF I had known that this CD was burned or created in China, I would not of purchased this CD. I cannot put this on my IPOD or Cell phone music file because this is in Chinese. I thought I was getting English since I live in the USA. So mad!!!!Going to Target to get it now.

B0069UP2PI|5.0|I can understand why some people say \\"slow, boring\\", but for some reason this movie grabbed me by the throat and didn't let go.  I love movies that create an atmosphere and pull you into that atmosphere, and for me Contagion did that exceptionally well.  For me what others see as the \\"slow, boring\\" aspect of the movie was what pulled me into it - it's cold, hard approach to sudden death and its impact on those affected - on a family scale and on a global scale.  It does a great job of progressing from what appears to be a hopeless situation for some characters and the world in general to the progression to a better (???) outcome.  The subtle twists for the future of some characters that never get expounded upon gave another aspect I love in some movies.  They leave it to you to imagine what happens to those characters - something I know some people really don't enjoy.  For me it worked very well and it's one of those movies that I can watch over and over again and still enjoy.

B007SGM084|5.0|Well written love story, with kink.  I am looking forward to the next set from Grey's side of the story.  Definately not for children or closed-minded people.
0345803485|1.0|I write for a living. I am very open to different forms of expression. To call this author a writer is beyond words ... insulting.<br />The actual story could have been written in 30 pages, lesson told and all. It is filled with kinky sex, cruelty and disrespect towards women. If the main followers of this book are women, I would suggest that they are lacking terribly in their relationships with the opposite sex. Mothers ... teach your daughters to respect and earn respect from others. This book sends all the wrong messages ... Hated it. Love is soft and gentle not hard and cruel.

1935550284|5.0|This series is really amazing.  Quite wonderful.<br /><br />Shakespeare's magic often can seem inaccessible.<br /><br />This 30-Minute Shakespeare guide leads everyone and anyone -- actor, director, school or other group -- by the hand through ingeniously shortened texts of Shakespeare's masterpiece plays.<br /><br />Part of the genius of The 30-Minute Shakespeare is the shortening of the text of the play script.  Nick Newlin has brilliantly shortened these plays so that you end up with a coherent, whole, self-contained and self-explanatory story version of the play.  The Tempest, told in 30 minutes.  And all in Shakespeare's language:  not \\"modernized\\" speech, but the real Elizabethan words of the Bard.  Newlin's editing makes the words and the sense crystal clear.<br /><br />But that's just the start.<br /><br />How do you perform this stuff?  Nick Newlin tells you!  He makes it totally simple and accessible.<br /><br />This book will give you a sure fire success as you and your group read the words off the page and put Shakespeare's magical play on its feet -- how to do so is all explained to you, step by step, in these remarkable manuals.<br /><br />A fantastic key to putting on a Shakespeare play -- which is of course what they were written for!  To be acted!  Shakespeare's words will make beautiful sense as you follow Newlin's easy to use and masterfully constructed guide to perform your own Shakespeare play.
1593272782|5.0|I've had all three of Isogawa's Technic Idea books for a while now. After reading some of the reviews and comments here, I felt compelled to contribute some information to this discussion. The point I want to make is that these books are *Idea Books*, not *cookbooks*. You would have guessed that from the book title, but reading through the reviews here, it appears that this isn't obvious, so let me explain.<br /><br />But before I do, in Mr. Isogawa's own words: \\"This book is full of little seeds for ideas. It is you who will cultivate these seeds so they will grow into wonderful masterpieces.\\" This means that this book is full of ideas, not ready made recipes that you would find in a cookbook. There's no list of ingredients, and  also no step-by-step instructions to make everything. If you want full instructions, this may not be the right book for you.<br /><br />This book has numerous examples that show the essential principles of building LEGO vehicles. It also shows how you can use LEGO motors to make your vehicles move. And here's where \\"all those expensive rare components\\" come in. Truth is, you really don't need all these pieces.<br /><br />The best example is the use of motors. Pages 4-17 show you many working examples of motor powered vehicles. All of these vehicles do the same: move when you switch on the motor, so you really need to build only one of them. Now, all these vehicles illustrated on these pages use *6 different types* of LEGO motors (to be clear, only one motor per vehicle). The author has done this so that literally *anyone with any LEGO motor* can build this little car.<br /><br />So you really need just one motor. And once you've followed Mr. Isogawa's suggestions on how to mount your particular motor on a (any) LEGO construction, you're ready to add this motor to all of the other special vehicles in this book - even if it doesn't picture your motor. All motors do the same. Just plug and play.<br /><br />Clearly the same goes for wheels. Every wheel will work. And if your wheels are too big to fit the example car, just make the car bigger. After all, that's the point of this book: inspire you to build your own creations.<br /><br />While the author has kindly provided a parts list that show the pieces used in this book, I actually do not recommend to buy pieces based on this list. Rather, I would suggest that you buy one of the bigger LEGO Technic Sets, especially one with at least one motor. That's much more pieces for your money, plus you can build an awesome truck or bulldozer when you're done building wheeled wonders.<br /><br />And instead of going to Bricklink to hunt down rare pieces, search for \\"Peeron\\", which is a site that shows which pieces can be found in each LEGO set. Just enter the part number of the LEGO set and find what's in it. You can still buy that great looking truck, but be sure to use this site to check that it includes some gears, wheels and a motor so you're good to go to build the vehicles in this book.<br /><br />And as with any LEGO related product, a child may need a little guidance. A child won't read this review, but if you read it, just build something together with your kid and show them what I said here. They'll get it, and I'm sure you'll like the LEGO experience too.ery wheel will work. And if your wheels are too big to fit the example car, just make the car bigger.

0439023491|4.0|The first third or so of the book was a little slow but it picks up and finishes off as you would expect from this very good series.  A must read for anyone that's already read the first and the third book only gets better.<br /><br />A very good series...very much recommended.

0439023513|5.0|I really enjoyed the last book and read it in just a couple of days.  I liked how real it all was...there was no cheesy ending where everyone lives happily ever after.  Great finish to a great series!
B0086700CM|4.0|this is a great app to kill some time without being completely brainless...I would recommend it especially for the price. :-)
0439023521|5.0|Very fun read and one you breeze through in just a day or two.  There are over 7,000 reviews to this book so I won't get into it much, just know that this is well worth the read and very much recommended.
0345803485|2.0|When I first heard about this book I decided it was something I would stay away from. But after hearing there was a movie deal in the works, I needed to see what was SO good about it for it to be made into a movie.    I am also a new author, not formally educated in writing, so my \\"education\\" is reading what best selling authors are writing. \\"Really?!\\" is all I could keep thinking as I read this book. (which I didn't finish) I write about romance & faith, but can't hit the 100th sale mark, but this lady writes about unrealistic sex & becomes a best seller & gets a movie deal?  Something is very wrong here.    I read in another interview that our daughters will be reading this book and thinking this is what sex is all about. How gut wrenching. As a mother of 2 pre-teens, that thought makes me sick to my stomach.    So disappointed that this is what readers want. How in the world are they going to make this into a movie without an X rating?    Sarah J. Boyer

B0079R8KXG|5.0|I got this because it was cheap and looked like a good choice and it was! It has a nice elastic band to keep it closed and I love the easy way it stands. It's a great investment for my kindle. My favorite feature is the bold red cover that makes it stand out from the crowd! I love this!
1936608898|5.0|I've read a decent number of health/nutrition/fitness books over the last few years, somewhere in the high 20's.  It Start With Food stands at the top of the pack.  It is pumped full of information and is quite enjoyable to read.  A lot of the books I have read read like a dictionary just throwing term after term at you, Melissa and Dallas' book flows from chapter to chapter and always left me craving for more. The diagrams and tables are easy to understand unlike some of the others that I have read.<br /><br />The information on all the food groups, both good and bad, is absolutely fantastic.  The Meal map is just great. It's a choose your own adventure to some delicious meals.  We've been making a lot of them ever since we got the book.<br /><br />If you want to eat healthier, have more energy, feel better, or know someone who does, this book is the one for you

0345803485|1.0|I am flabbergasted at how well this thing is doing. This book is terrible. Oh where to begin...<br /><br />First off, Anastasia Steele is one of the worst names ever created, right up there with Susan Storm/ Ron Burgandy in the cheesiest super hero/ news anchor naming contest. I would say this book has a plot, but it doesn't. Basically, just take all the main characters from Twilight, make them even more terrible, and add the author's creepy dreamy escapism for BDSM, and you pretty much have all you need to know about the story. Oh, and they bone, like constantly. How this Anastasia chick isn't hobbling around by the first half of the book is beyond me. The fact that this was a Twilight fanfiction is still painfully obvious. Ditzy mom, quiet dad, mysterious rich handsome man, minority friend named Jose who harbors feelings for the main character, but will never get a piece of that, um, rear, or should I say `down there'? Hmm, I wonder who that's supposed to be...  Half the book is about some ridiculous contract she has to sign in order to be with him, and the other consists of emails of them, back and forth, in -I'm not shafting you- email format, complete with subject line and all. Ugh. Kate, her best friend, pretty much disappears around the end, presumably to get away from Christian and Bella, dang it, Anastasia and all their crazy. I found myself wanting to join her.<br /><br />The main character in this book is pretty uninteresting. Just like Bella. She is a klutz, but somehow very pretty and innocent without having really any boyfriends or interest in men until our villain, err, I mean hero shows up with her only real defining personality trait being that she like classic English literature. Why the classic literature? Why do authors think that's all they need to create an interesting female protagonist? In fact, it's not even interesting, it's dull. And she's pathetic. There are several moments throughout where she has to be literally told to breathe. A basichuman function, and she can't even do that. The most infuriating, however, is her constant justification for Christian's overbearing, abusive stalker like behavior, and how she believes she can fix him and how much abuse she goes through for him. I call it abuse, because that is exactly what it is. I get the whole BDSM thing and all, but it wasn't what the girl signed up for and wasn't really into. Half the time she was terrified or walking on eggshells wondering what mood he was going to be in. If you are in any way, shape, or form afraid of your partner, then you should not be in that relationship. Period.<br /><br />Our dominant, Christian Grey, is a true romantic, holding a girl's hair back while drunkenly puking, after he tracked her down using her cell phone and `rescues' her from having a good time at a club with her friends. Swoon worthy, really. Gross... It's a nice gesture, but not something that really builds up the romantic tension. Ha, who am I kidding? There is no romantic tension in this book. Another victim of the insta-love phenomenon. On that note, Mr. Grey is controlling, condescending, creepy, perverted, cold, jerks her around- emotionally and physically *tee-hee*- possessive, abusive, and a stalker. And he listens to opera music. If I didn't know any better, this guy sounds like a serial killer... Any man that requires freaking paperwork in order to touch or be with you, should make you run for the hills, past the hills in fact. But yet, that does not deter our heroine, if that's what we should even call her. But that's alright, because he's beautiful. Everything is alright because he is beautiful. His is just damaged and dark and deep. A nice message to send to women and impressionable. He keeps telling her he is not good for her and she needs to stay away from him, when he is the one who is doing all the chasing. Huh? Apparently he finds girls with the personalities of cardboard impossible to resist, even though he is a bajillionaire, good ateverything, and extremely good looking. Oops, no, I mean beautiful, as we are reminded on pretty much every page, every paragraph, every sentence. Maybe because they are the only types of girls willing to put up with him. Do women really find his controlling behavior so swoon-worthy? *Seriously girls, if a man hits you and hurts you, physically and/ or emotionally, and makes you constantly cry and feel down about yourself, that is ABUSE. There is no excuse. No matter how hot he is or emotionally damaged. Run the other way and DON'T look back. There is some serious nonsense going on in this book, and I am not talking about the sex. Christian Grey is the kind of man that belongs on Jerry Springer or Dr. Phil., not in your bedroom.*<br /><br />There were some things that were truly odd with this book. But the one that grossed me out the most was the fact that she uses his tooth brush. Seriously, she uses his tooth brush! To feel him inside of her! This is a turn on?! This is even a thing?! Ugh, I'm gonna throw up. This chick is seriously mental. The only reason Christain Grey is mysterious to her is because she is too damn stupid to figure out his obvious clues. He's not mysterious, he's creepy. But it turns out she's not winning any normalcy awards, so really, it's a match made in disturbing heaven. And don't even get me started on the tampon scene and how he makes it his business to know her cycle. And how he special orders a gynecologist for her so she could get contraception-ed up! And says he would like to watch as well. Do people do this?! Is this what's passing for kinky nowa' days? I can understand escapism, but come on. Not when it is this laughable. Seriously, some of this read like `Peterotica'. In fact, I would probably get more pleasure out of reading `Peterotica'.<br /><br />Also, the personification of her subconscious was just bizarre. Either that or this girl is seriously crazy with someone named `subconscious' living in her head. I kept imagining theold Miss Manners lady popping into her head to give her sage advice, her eyebrow figuratively raised. Maybe a ghost is trapped in there? She does know that her subconscious is actually a part of her and not a disembodied being, right? And don't even get me started about her `Inner Goddess', a seventies era Goldie Hawn flower child also living in her head. I know what the author is aiming for, but it just comes off as weird...<br /><br />Speaking of the writing...<br /><br />Not even the editors wanted to read through this thing... I would have thought that after it was picked up by a publisher, they would have had some sort of rewrite/ editing process. Typos and grammar errors abound. Even double descriptors in the same paragraph, sometimes even in the same sentence. Something that could have easily been caught and dealt with. I can let the obvious Britishisms slide, but why the author didn't just set this in England is beyond me. Maybe Bella, er, Anastasia could have gotten a scholarship to an English school? Everyone must have hearing aids, because everyone is either murmuring, muttering, or whispering something all the time, and yet they still are able to hear and understand each other. Either that or they have crazy mutant hearing superpowers... All throughout the book, I kept wondering about the resale value of his penthouse apartment with the `Red Room of Pain'. I kept imagining scenarios where a realtor tries to dress it up and show it to potential buyers to distract me from the awful writing. Though I do have to say, this book has one of the best lines I've read recently: \\"I don't make love. I f*... hard.\\" One that is delivered by our debonair hero.<br /><br />I think I laughed for three days after reading that particular gem.<br /><br />Christian does get a smidge better towards the middle-end, and seems like he is actually trying for Anastasia. Though, I have to admit, one of the main reasons I kept reading was to find out about the `situation', which wasnever revealed anyway. His creepy stalkerism just gets worse and the only way this couple can really seem to truly communicate with each other is through a long series of frustrating email format writing. This couple has clearly fallen in, what is quite popular now, obsession with each other. Not love. There is a difference. Every chance they get, they are boning, so much so that it tires me out, and starts to lose its novelty. But as much as I hated most of this book, I did find myself enjoying some of the softer, quieter moments. And the glider and helicopter scenes, but mainly because I have a strange fascination with aviation and flying in general. I want to ride in a helicopter so bad, it's killing me! But I digress...<br /><br />As the story progressed, it seemed to me that she was doing most of the compromising, and I really wish she would have touched him out of spite. Just to do it. And it was driving me crazy, but perhaps that's what the author was going for. Just crazy in general. I am glad Anastasia finally stands up for herself at the end, and as I finished reading, I wondered if I should even bother with the rest of the series, or if I should just stop at such a happy ending... Some things are best left bitter-sweet.<br /><br />P.S. Do yourself a favor and google Gilbert Gottfried reads 50 Shade of Grey.

B003L0VJF6|5.0|Julia Fischer's vital energy and crisp emotional yet precise interpretation on both violin and piano bring the composer's works to the highest artistic levels.  I believe the virtuosity exhibited, both by Julia Fischer and the orchestra would please Greig and Saint-Saens and leave them satisfied that their artistic vision for their compositions has been matched.
030758836X|5.0|As the daughter of a fiction writer, I have spent most of my life discussing what makes a stellar character in any novel.<br />Gillian Flynn hits every single aspect in Gone Girl. Her characters are witty and smart, complicated, empathetic and at times, evil and conniving. You don't know whether to love them, hate them, sympathise with them or even if you understand them at all.<br />As a result, the book becomes so human and so real that you find yourself completely immersed in their world.<br /><br />In terms of plot, Flynn manages to keep you (as they say) guessing at every turn. You read the novel, thinking you understand what's really going on - that you get the characters and their separate backstories - and then Flynn will add a completely unexpected element to the story.<br /><br />I don't want to give any of the plot away but I'll leave with this parting statement (that I heard from another Gone Girl lover): \\"If you ever want to get any work done, don't pick up Gone Girl because you will not be able to put it down.\\"

B004XQO90O|2.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br /> The concept where a particular past juncture in time is re-visited in order to effect a change in future circumstances, was marvelously handled in the brilliant comedy-fantasy, 'Groundhog Day'. 'Source Code' utilizes a similar concept, but here it should basically be subsumed under the genre of Sci-fi Thriller. Unlike 'Groundhog Day', which repeatedly brings a time-tripping Bill Murray back to the past by sleight of hand, 'Source Code' provides a pseudo-scientific rationale, which proves in the end to be decidedly derivative of other time travel tales we've seen before.<br /><br />Our protagonist, former Army helicopter pilot, Colter Stevens, now severely injured and in a comatose state, is being used as part of a secret US Army project dubbed 'Source Code', to uncover the identity of an individual who bombed a Chicago commuter train, earlier that day. The creator of the project, Dr. Rutledge, and his assistant, Air Force Captain Goodwin, repeatedly keep sending Stevens back eight minutes prior to the bombing inside an experimental device which resembles a space capsule, in order to find out who planted the bomb so they can stop him from detonating an even more destructive dirty bomb in downtown Chicago, which the bomber has promised to do an hour later.<br /><br />Stevens learns that he's unable to change events in the future reality which Goodwin and Rutledge are a part of, and is only able to be an observer. The Source Code enables Stevens to enter the body of one of the now deceased victims, Sean Fentress, and move about on the train in a parallel universe. While the basic events in each alternate time line are the same (the bomber always plants the bomb in the same place), due to Stevens/Fentress acting differently in each time line, the exact sequence of events is changed. The concept derives from 'Groundhog Day', where the core events end up as variations on a theme. The interactive aspect of the protagonist's abilities, can also be likened to the Star Trek holodeck, where a user is able to interact with a series of images which are mere projections of reality.<br /><br />One can argue with all the pseudo-scientific explanations but the films' scenarists are basically asking the audience to suspend one's disbelief when it comes to the main premise. For some this is a big problem, but I found other areas of the film to take issue with. One of screenwriter Ben Ripley's big quandaries is how to develop Stevens' character arc in eight minute segments. You'll recall that Bill Murray's 'Phil' character in 'Groundhog Day' was a narcissist who needed to learn an important life's lesson about being a nice guy. He has a whole day (repeated multiple times) to transform himself. Here, we learn virtually nothing about Fentress as his back story is a cypher. When Stevens becomes Fentress, Ripley has him gradually warming up to the film's love interest, Christina Warren, after he acts gruffly toward her when Stevens makes his first 'time trip'. But Stevens/Fentress acts badly at first because Stevens is disoriented not because he has a character defect. So the transformation seems unnecessary and forced since Steven's only real goal is to prevent the bomber from causing further havoc.<br /><br />Equally less charming are the assorted characters Stevens must deal with on the train and the methods he employs to find out whether they might be the particular villain he's looking for. Again, a comparison to 'Groundhog Day' is instructive. All of the characters Phil interacts with in the Groundhog Day universe, are utterly quirky and charming. Here, they're stereotypical--either obnoxious (bad comedian) or ineffectual (computer geek). What's more, Ripley lacks the imagination to come up with a series of interesting variants. All Stevens/Fentress ends up doing is awkwardly confronting each one of his suspects by ripping the bags they're carrying and spilling the contents on the ground andgetting into some kind of physical or verbal confrontation.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest clue that 'Source Code' lacks gravitas, is in its choice of a convincing antagonist. Heaven forbid that Mr. Ripley would attempt to create a bad guy rooted in today's headlines. Instead of perhaps an Al Qaeda sympathizer, we're presented with a Mad Bomber of the 1950s dressed up as a modern day disaffected techie. When both the bad guys and the good guys in your movie don't seem very real, the stakes aren't very high and hence the tension on the 'suspense' meter, has got to be very low!<br /><br />Finally, there's the whole question of a so-called 'twist ending' that doesn't seem to be very surprising at all. Remember, according to the rules of the alternate time line, changing events in a parallel universe, cannot change anything in the present real world. So when Stevens sends the text message to Goodwin that he's stopped the bomber and that the Source Code experiment worked, and Goodwin and Rutledge aren't even aware that any of those events have transpired, that's not the same world we experienced at the beginning of the film. Rather, it's an alternate universe where the 'happy ending' of Sean and Christina walking off into the sunset, is a reality. One other thing that did bother a lot of other people who have posted on the internet, is what happened to Sean once Stevens takes over his consciousness? I guess he's left screaming, inside the mirror!<br /><br />Back in the real world, the reality of the train bombing remains unchanged. We do wonder, after all those time jumps, did Stevens have enough time to actually communicate the information about the bomber to Rutledge and Goodwin? Couldn't the bomber have easily driven to downtown Chicago and set off his dirty bomb given how much time Stevens was taking with his jumps and inside the capsule?<br /><br />Source Code looks and feels more like a movie made exclusively for the Syfy channel. It keeps your interest in a basic way but certainly doesn't deserve all the accolades heaped upon it to date.getting into some kind of physical or verbal confrontation.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest clue that 'Source Code' lacks gravitas, is in its choice of a convincing antagonist.

B000WQ9UA8|2.0|\\"Blackout\\" took 4 years to produce. After giving birth to her sons, marrying and divorcing K-Fed, and to top it all off, a mental breakdown, it was a surprise that Britney was able to record anything at all, let alone a full-length album. The fact that she was able to put her best foot forward on this album, even though she wasn't mentally her best, is brilliant. What's not brilliant, however, was the final result. This album follows the pattern of Britney singing whatever song is put in front of her, and her voice was most likely tweeked by a computer and put through many filters and auto-tune. She took control of this album as the executive producer, which would explain why its content is just one thumping, gritty, and trashy hot mess track after another. The album starts off great with its lead single \\"Gimme More\\", and continues on to three more great tracks, \\"Piece Of Me\\" (my personal favorite), \\"Radar\\", and \\"Break the Ice\\". After that point, the album goes downhill swiftly over eight more songs. Most have put \\"Blackout\\" in a more positive light because of the fact that she was able to pull herself together to make this record, but for it to be a true success and a comeback at the same time, Britney is going to need more than just effort. Perhaps, if she were to cut down on the millions of producers and writers she brought in to help her, the album would have been cleaner and more fluid. She also would've been helped by cleaning herself up as well, because \\"Blackout\\" is simply a pure reflection of what she was like at the time, a messy and bombastic star who's seemed to have lost her way. Once again, it's great that she came through for her fans and offered them 12 new tracks to tide them over until she cleans up her act, but unfortunately, it's just too much. Let's just hope that her creativity doesn't blackout so in the future she can avoid another flop like this.
0345803485|1.0|Someone needs to submit the entirety of this book to the Bulwer-Litton bad writing contest.  I have the award winning sentence right here, noted by another reviewer:<br /><br />\\"His voice is warm and husky like dark melted chocolate fudge caramel... or something.\\"<br /><br />It doesn't get any more unintentionally funny than that.  hahahahaha!
B000002SYG|5.0|I love the classic hits!!! This CD is a great addition to my collection. I love the 80's and the 90's. I find this music to be comforting and fun!! I can play this while I'm cruising down the highway or taking a road trip. Totally necessary for your summer collection if you're feeling nostalgic!!!
B005HJWWW8|1.0|As soon as I plugged the amp into the charger for the first time, I noticed it was blinking red. I thought this meant it was charging and left it to charge overnight. However, the next morning it had no charge on it AT ALL. I checked online, and the blink red indicates a bad battery. I tried unplugging and replugging the amp into the charger, but it always blinked red and lost power as soon as the charging cable was disconnected.<br /><br />The only way for me to use this is to have it plugged into the charger, which requires me to be very near a wall socket due to the short charging cable provided, plus the hassle of having 3 cables plugged into the tiny amp.<br /><br />I CANNOT recommend this item if you are expecting something of functional quality.
B000FA5STS|2.0|I found the first half of this book to be incredibly boring.  I almost stopped reading it,but, because I really like this authors work, I continued on --and on---and on. The second half of the book was better, lots of action, but it was really implausable. The end was so fast paced and so impossible that it was almost funny, a lot of super people running around offing each other.  I thought it would never end!! I am a prolific reader and generally finish a book in two days, sometimes less, but this one was the exception.  This bokk was certainly not bad, but it wasnt good either!!! When it comes to action, sometimes less is better than more.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Its a fun little game to pass the time with. However, it's been getting laggy and extremely slow as of late. Makes it near impossible to accomplish anything at all. Hopefully there will be an update to help this. You run out of energy quickly, but you get more as you level up. Once you run out you can either wait for it to fill up (1 point of energy every 3 min), or buy more. I'm not sure how much that is because I'm kind of cheap and wont pay. You CAN play offline by the way, which is a nice plus. Some features of the game do require Internet, though. It's a lot like Frontierville for those that have played that on Facebook. Anyway, 3 of 5 just because of that horrid lag that's been going on for weeks. Please fix and it gets the other 2. :)

I particularly liked *spoiler alert*<br /><br />The picture of the toy store.  Luke sees the Jar-Jar dolls.  Vader waves his hand \\"This isn't the toy you're looking for...\\"  Luke replies \\"Yes, it is..\\" or the comic of Luke and Vader in a corridor on the Death Star.  \\"Dad, why is it called a \\"Death Star\\"?  Er.....<br /><br />I have read it a couple times and still manage to smile......
B004HB9FPO|2.0|I really like Michael Crichton, and have loved many of his books,<br />especially Jurassic Park and Congo.  This offering was not that good.  I<br />give it three stars because, like all his books, it is well written.  He<br />doesn't do a very good job on the subject matter though, nanotechnology.  I<br />would have thought a writer of his caliber would have done more research on<br />the subject before he committed himself to a novel, but obviously he<br />didn't.  If you want to read Crichton then read something else.  You will<br />come away from this book not really wanting to read any more of him, and<br />that would be a shame.

0553288105|5.0|In The Gods Themselves humanity discovers the secret of unlimited energy,<br />tapping another dimension without knowing that an alien culture is doing<br />the same thing to us.  Asimov doesn't do many aliens in his work, but he<br />does them well here, as the aliens are as completely non-human as can be<br />imagined.  And there is a twist to the story in that the aliens are hoping<br />we will keep using our unlimited power source, until our universe collapses<br />and they gain energy for the rest of time from that collapse.  That part<br />sort of sounds like corporate America, let's get what we can out of it no<br />matter the harm to others.  But some of the aliens have a conscience, and<br />the story revolves around them.  Great fiction, written by a master and<br />well worth the read.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is the best game I have finish this game 4 times and I am still not bored of it if I was u I would totally get it
0671004107|4.0|I had read a bunch of Sagan's nonfiction, and was sure he had some fiction<br />out there, but when I read this novel I found that I was wrong. A very good<br />and imaginative work by a real Astrophysicist, man makes contact with<br />aliens through SETI and build the device the aliens give them plans to so<br />that first contact can be achieved.  The ending is not what you would<br />think, but is still very good.  I would recommend this book to fans of<br />Arthur C Clarke, as it is in the mold of 2001 and other books which portray<br />an alien culture as so advanced as to be beyond our understanding.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Def a fun, good time waster! I just wish there way to earn accorns without paying for them all the time.
0486282112|5.0|While this was called a horror novel by some, it is really one of the<br />earliest science fiction novels.  It is about a scientist who brings a man<br />constructed of body parts to life.  The monster is very different from<br />those portrayed in most of the movies based on this book.  He can speak,<br />reason, etc, but is still horrific.  A great novel, a classic, how else to<br />describe it.  Of course it is written in archaic language, but it is still<br />great literature and something everyone should read at least once.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wow, what a creative and interesting read? Always amazed that a person can actually come with such an interesting story. Cannot wait for the next book!
079073804X|1.0|Is there anything to be gained from this genre?  As Bishop Sam Aquila wrote in a foreward to Father Jose Antonio Fortea's [[ASIN:1932645969 Interview With an Exorcist]],  * \\"Although all Catholics should have a basic understanding of the reality of evil, we should also avoid being overly preoccupied with the topic of the devil. The Evil One is capable of using such a fascination as a means to ensnare us - with despair, fear, or discouragement\\" (p. 3).    Right on!  We can be absolutely assured that only God is All Powerful, and He is absolutely victorious over the devil!  In surrendering to God, who loves each and every one of us limitlessly, we find absolute fulfillment and untold happiness.    Four decades ago, it appears that the green stuff (i.e., the money, not the pea soup) got the better of the author:  * \\"while I was working on 'The Exorcist,' what I thought I was writing was a novel of faith in the popular dress of a thrilling and suspenseful detective story - in other words, a sermon that no one could possibly sleep through -- and to this day I haven't the faintest recollection of any intention to frighten the reader, which many will take, I suppose, as an admission of failure on an almost stupefying, scale....I do keep wishing...that 'The Exorcist' be remembered at this time of the year for being not about shivers but rather about souls, for then it would indeed be in the real and true spirit of Halloween, which is short for the eve of All Hallows or All Saints Day\\" (William Peter Blatty, FoxNews.com <[...]>, 10/28/11)    That's great Bill, but what about all that money for the crap which was actually put on film?    The simple reality is this: Your best take on exorcism is to be found in the [[ASIN:B00635I88C Catechism]] or the [[ASIN:1574557203 Compendium of the Catechism]].

B008469DGY|1.0|I uploaded this game yesterday.  It is not ready.  It froze while playing.  Play was jerky.  It could not be shut down without me overpowering it with a system shutdown.  I will not open this app again because of the problems.  I will not recommend this app to be purchased soon.  Too buggy.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I don't know why this movie received any bad reviews, it was a good film to me. The effects are well done. The story is easy to follow. It has action end to end. It has a bit of a twist ending, I liked that too. I watched it on Amazon Instant Video (rented) twice, and now I am going to order the DVD. The Tharks are rendered well and are great characters, you can't help but find them interesting.<br /><br />I wish this film had done better at the box office, just so they would make some more movies from the books. (I haven't read the books since I was a teen, but I am reading them all again. They are free to download if you have Amazon Prime).
0307888908|3.0|I'm not sure I've gleaned anything useful from this book.  There is lots of sound, but cliché advice.  I read the book from cover to cover, but cannot seem to recall any specific story or advice that will enhance my career prospects.  The material in the book is a little disjointed, and it's difficult to keep the interest of the reader throughout.  At best, \\"The Start-up of You\\" may refresh your memory that this is a volatile and global job market, and no one should rest on their laurels.  Keep advancing your knowledge and learn new complimentary or transferable skills to avoid typecasting yourself.  I found the book lacking in specific direction on where to go or what to do to achieve these objectives.<br /><br />It is true that employers have not been willing to train employees as extensively as the bygone era of life time employment.  This is why job retraining programs at a macro scale are sorely needed at a time when businesses are more interested in outsourcing human capital to foreign countries.  There was no discussion of that in the book.  Just take control of your career with an entrepreneurial mindset, and never mind that most aspiring entrepreneurs never succeed.<br /><br />The average U.S. worker needs more than just advice on expanding his/her professional network.  Not everyone is from a highly credentialed academic pedigree with an extensive rolodex of Silicon Valley connections.  As much as we are inclined to believe America is the land of opportunity, and that hard work and perseverance will pay off in the end, this is less the case with each passing generation.  A recent USA Today/Gallup poll indicated six out of ten Americans do not believe their children will have a brighter future than them.  According to CNN's Jack Cafferty, \\"Young Americans are being crushed by college debt.  And even with college degrees, many of them can't find jobs.\\"  Nobel laureate economist Joseph Stiglitz has declared the American dream a myth.  In June 26, 2012, he wrote in the Financial Times, \\"Today, a child's life chances are more dependent on the income of his or her parents than in Europe, or any other of the advanced industrial countries for which there are data.\\"  There are clearly structural problems in dire need of attention along with the entrepreneurial mindset.<br /><br />While The Start-up of You is a book about enhancing one's career through individual effort, and not about social forces that restrain opportunity, one might get the impression that a failed career is purely the result of a failed individual effort.  This is evidently not the case.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I'll just say, I enjoyed reading these 1 star reviews better than this novel, dont get me wrong it had its entertaining moments (none of them sexual, except maybe the first, and that was because it brought back some high school memories). If you must read it don't waste your money, find some sucker to borrow it from. If they cut out all the mundane, droll and repetitive crap, you would have ended up with a cute little romance novel,written for high school girls, who dream of the beyond perfect God/fantasy man, we ain't just talkin' knight on a white horse here. Bizarrely, I enjoyed the little email banters; but once again it was a flash back to days gone by, (I notice most people found them annoying). Enough said, I wasted enough of my time on these three audio books, don't want to waste more writing reviews.I will say it made good background noise while cutting my lawn. Just read some of these GREAT 1&2 star reviews they all seem to have hit it on the nose. In fact some of them sound like they would be better writers than this books novelist. You gotta wonder what kind of world we live in when this sub-par novel makes it to the best sellers list, it just proves the media runs our lives and we will follow there hype.Bow to them,sheep.bahbahbah.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I've been a Rush fan for 30+ years now. I've always thought of them as that somewhat different friend, whom your other friends don't quite get. They do things you like and love (Hemispheres and Moving Pictures), they do things that leave you scratching your head (Presto), and they sometimes do things that leave you plain disappointed (A Show of Hands) and perhaps a little sheepish. However, they are so earnest, they work so hard, they are so honest, and they follow a course of their own - so you respect them and remain friends, through thick and thin, ups and downs.<br /><br />The classic albums will forever be - \\"Remember that time when you ... !\\" and the occasional lows still fondly get remembered with an \\"I still can't believe you ...\\"<br />Plain and simple this album is one of those classic \\"Remember that time when you ...!\\" moments.<br /><br />I truly believe it is one of their strongest albums ever. It is tight conceptually, instrumentally, and sonically. It flows from beginning to end. As the album has been well dissected here, track by track, I won't do a deep dive. However, I do have a couple of recommendations -<br /><br />1 - Read the protagonist's story, noted before each song's lyrics, before listening. It greatly adds to understanding the work and enjoyment of the album.<br />2 - Listen to it loud or through headphones, ear buds, or some other device that puts the music right into your ears. On the first listen, I didn't really have any volume behind it, and I just didn't get it. Then, I turned it up and it all made perfect sense.<br />(3 - Go to a Rush concert, if you haven't before. (Okay, that's not related to this album, but if you haven't gone to see them yet, you should.  Oh, and plan a bathroom break during Red Sector A. I could never warm to that live...))
B006MW3UZW|5.0|If you have never heard of Downton Abby, you are in for a real treat.  This series draws you right in and explores your full range of emotions as the well developed characters are directed and played so well.  This is the kind of production that leaves you thinking about it days after you have watched the last episode.  The CDs are well done with behind the scenes explanations and the detailed history to this era. The twists and turns in every episode challenge you to keep up.  You will find yourself amused at the \\"English\\" spoken and often we found ourselves going back because we didn't quite understand what was said the first time.  Another plus to watching on CD.<br /><br />We have now watched the entire first two seasons and can hardly wait for season 3 to start this fall (2012).
B007SGM084|5.0|This was truly a book trio that I could not put down. Since it was on my Kindle Fire, I read it constantly. E.L. James is now one of my favs! Can't wait for more projects to come.
0385738773|5.0|Fist of all \\"The Maze Runner\\" trilogy became one of my favorites I couldn't put it down until I finished reading them. I love that its not a regular, everything would be perfect, kind of book. It has twist and turns and it actually even made me feel like crying, and confused about WICKED being nice or not.
B004ZJZQ7O|5.0|American Gangster will be what the godfather is today in a few decades. This movie blends action, suspense, and drama almost too perfectly and Denzel's performance is phenomenal. The bluray transfer looks great and the package comes with a digital copy and DVD for on the run purposes. Overall, for 9 bucks, this is totally worth it for an amazing film
B007R41E8O|5.0|I love everyhing about this game!  It has a great story that keeps me wanting to see where each step leads.  The graphics and sound effects are incredible.  I hope the developers will make a series of games like this to keep us all entertained!<br />if you are a fan of point and click mystery games, I would highly recommend this game to you.  If you have never played this type of game, this is the perfect one to try.
B004NTDEXY|4.0|American History X is a dark, troubling film that will arouse emotion and sympathy in even the most cold-hearted individual. Great film but a tad disturbing. History of Violence is pretty good IMO but i Havnt seen it in a while so I'm gonna give it another shot. Video quality is not the best, but these movies are not visually stunning to begin with. Great deal for 9 $
0761169253|5.0|I picked up this book while browsing in a bookstore waiting for my commuter train. I was hooked immediately. It totally engrossed me on my 45 minute train ride and gave me all kinds of ideas.  I finished it that evening and took some of the ideas it inspired and applied them to two HR projects I'm currently working on -- so it's already paid for itself in my eyes 100 times.  The book is not only for creative types.  I'm a business guy and profited a lot from the advice it has.  I like that the book is straightforward and cuts to the chase.  The simple drawings and the examples help bring the ideas alive.  Kudos!
B000EWBKK8|5.0|I've seen this movie several times, but it never loses its impact on me. This is one of Nicholas Cage's only good films and I feel that all the performances are great in the movie. With DVD's becoming obsolete and the fact that my friend stole my DVD copy, I felt compelled to get the movie on BLURAY. It looks great and for a low price to boot
B006RUJST6|5.0|I was so glad that a stumbled upon this book. I stayed up until 4:30 am reading this book. Couldn't put it down and didn't want it to end. Lucky there's a sequel 'Point of Retreat\\".
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I had never seen the Godfather movies, but after ordering this I've definitely falling in love with these films. The first two are phenomenal while the third is still good, but somewhat subpar when compared to the first two. The quality is great on all the films, with this being the best transfer ever made. The sound is also great. For any fan of Goodfellas, Casino, The Departed, and other gangster movies, The Godfather is definitely the original that inspired them all. GREAT COLLECTION GREAT MOVIES.<br />The only gripe I have is with the packaging. The slip cover folded up on the side a little too soon for my taste (after a couple days) and the little insert booklet barely fits inside the package, but overall a great buy for the price.

B0002VFXFE|2.0|The Arctic Silver was shipped to me from a Chinatown address in CA. It had no packaging that indicated it was packaged by the manufacturer. Instead, literally just the tube/syringe was put into an envelope with nothing else. Those are not things that inspire one's confidence that one has purchased the real thing. I used it to replace the thermal paste on my PS3. If it overheats and fails, I'll know why. So far, seems ok, but then I'm not playing games on it--just using it for the bluray player for a movie every now and then.

B003TWONOK|4.0|I am enjoying this book on my Kindle.....haven't quite finished it yet.  It's light , doesn't take much brain power to enjoy, but has kept my interest and maintains the tension of the chase woven into the dog training and the hot romance.  War and Peace it isn't but a good enjoyable read yes.  Bigred.

0743298039|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book and after the first 60 pages I couldn't put it down. The stories of past and present intertwine beautifully and help build the tension and mystery in the book. I absolutely loved reading this the more and more the pages went on and was sad when there was nothing left to read. I classify this book as very unique and one that is hard for me to compare to any other mysteries I've read. A great read!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|This app is cool! It is so helpful! I love this app! I can change my pictures from boring to fun and exciting! It's awesome and you could use it without paying anyone to edit your pics for you!
B004R13U6Y|5.0|This app is a class act and really easy to use.  It converts your doc to a pdf in seconds . . . and it doesn't cost you a yearly fee to use it like other pdf converter software.<br /><br />I just completed my first novel and used this to convert it from Word to a pdf to send to my publisher.  The finished book looks great on my Kindle Fire; in fact it looks just like an e-book I just downloaded from the Amazon store. . . and the way it turns pages from the top right corner is totally cool!<br /><br />MOD
B005LAIGZU|5.0|This movie is nothing short of terrific... Some reviews complained about the quality of acting but most of the main characters are Navy Seals, not actors so not sure what they expected.
B0086700CM|4.0|It's pretty fun for a 'free' game. Kind of repetitious, but interesting enough trying to unlock everything. I managed to do it without paying any actual money. All in all a fun way to pass the time if you are into this kind of game.
B00008BXJJ|4.0|The all time greatest. Must own, can,t live with out a least 2 copies(one four each ear). Blows the hell out of hell.
B008532S54|5.0|I am a 30-something person who enjoys and has had much contact, and even temporarily lived with the kind of free-living people featured in the movie, and I think this homage is pure genius!  I usually don't think much of the two main actors at all (Rudd or Aniston), but they were good in this movie.  The hippie ensemble is absolutely perfect.  Just loved this movie and if you have a love for these counter-culture types, you will probably find it to be harmless fun; a good-humored poke at hippies.  The film takes every cliche about hippies ever and squeezes them into the commune characters, but it's ok because it's self-aware that's it's just a movie; it's actually not trying to be offensive to \\"hippies\\" but in an odd way it celebrates them in a loving way! My boyfriend agrees, we both know people like the ones on the commune and believe the film presents them as sincere idealists.<br /><br />Overall, the whole movie is light, fun, is full of memorable moments and characters, has some lowbrow humor scenes (but not as overt as other movies), and has a more unique storyline than the average comedy. Like the two main characters, I appreciate that counter culture, but can't live in it full time. Usually I can't abide \\"raunchy\\" movies, but this one is actually sweet.  The lowbrow humor is more about the incredible openness of the people versus the overwhelming private-ness of the outsiders, which is a very funny juxtaposition!<br /><br />The movie is optimistic, wacky, and perhaps a bit too graphic (nudity, etc., but mostly in a non-sexual way). Are you offended by briefly watching old nudists (in a non-sexual scene)? Really? Haven't you ever seen male genitalia before? The nudity would be essential to telling the story of such a community (of which there are hundreds across America), so I don't believe it to be gratuitous in this case. These people really exist out there; I've met people like pretty much all the characters or bits of them and THEY have zero shame or weirdness about being naked (but of course, WE feel weird about it, hence the comedy).  It's just how they are, so it's all plausible.<br /><br />Some interesting flaws of the unexamined, materialistic life are pointed out throughout the film, such as how the brother basically deals with excrement to buy fancy things, like a big house--a metaphor for how the main character (and we) all live working \\"shoveling poop\\" or working at a hateful job just to buy \\"stuff\\" that makes us miserable anyway; so it's not 100% fluff--there is a message behind the laughs.  I thought the movie got funny and wackier as it progressed, with a ridiculous ending to an incredulous story. Why does anyone want a realistic ending to a silly movie?  Perhaps people are too uptight with their expectations.  I especially liked how the Aniston and Rudd characters change because of their experience on the farm.  I would definitely recommend watching this if you are in a playful and open mood.<br /><br />I would definitely caution prudish, mainstream, or materialistic types from watching this movie--it's not for the uptight! I also don't think this movie is actually as \\"raunchy\\" as viewers might expect it to be.  I typically can't stand Rudd or Aniston, yet I thoroughly enjoyed it!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Is the excitement about this book just due to women wanting a young, gorgeous, well endowed, accomplished but troubled billionaire to fall in love with them?  The writing was childlike, the characters ranged from uninteresting to unbelievable and nothing happened. I became less and less interested reading page after page of the protagonist wondering if the man loved her and if their relationship could work.  It was Bridget Jones' diary without the humor or cleverness.

I think the toy broke withih 24hours of opening it. It worked great at first, but then the hand controls started getting fuzzy and the legs wouldn't move. Thank goodness for Amazon reviews right?

030758836X|2.0|I purchased this book after seeing it on most Top Ten lists of books to read this summer.  I was excited to begin reading it, but then found myself stuck inside a twisted Lacy Peterson missing wife case.  If you like missing wife stories, maybe this book is for you.  If you like Nancy Grace, maybe this book is for you.  The plot has some twists that go beyond Nancy Grace, but for the most part it's a long read about something not exactly novel.  I'm not sure what all the hype about this book is from.  I was disappointed.
B006RXQ8RI|5.0|DVD came in perfect condition and on time.  I really Love this movie and on Blu-Ray it makes it 1,000 times better!!
0670022411|1.0|Almost to a person, every single reviewer who has rated this book online is a better writer than this author. Not only is the plot - what exists of it - plodding and tired, but then it suddenly skips forward leaving the reader desperate for a foothold.  It's like the author was too busy doing something else to explain to the reader why a character took a particular step or made a particular decision.<br />Also, everyone is ready to go to war sothat Diana and Matthew can get together? That seems really unlikely because WHO CARES??? I would pay money to keep these two nut balls apart! Yikes! Cave yourself the time and money. Do not buy this book.
B0018OFNHC|5.0|I bought this movie for my husband because he loves it.  It came perfectly packaged and it was an awesome price!!
B00005JMFQ|5.0|...but don't hold that against me!  That being said, I don't always like British romantic comedies.  Or ANY romantic comedies for that matter.  But this is a wonderful combination of different, intertwining stories and is wonderfully acted out by some of the best actors in the UK today.  Funny, heartbreaking, touching and well acted, this will be worth the watch, if for no other reason than seeing Hugh Grant doing a ridiculous, yet sublime and self-deprecating, dance as the Prime Minister.  Enjoy!

0345803485|4.0|I should say from the very start that if you are not aware (I'm sure everyone knows but just want to warn you) this book is all about the darker sides of sex and the subject matter may offend!<br /><br />Warning over! - So, this is another book I had no intentions of reading, however the very lovely ladies at CountryWives had a competition on Twitter to win a copy so what the heck I had a go and was delighted to win! If you read my reviews before, you know I am not a lover of reading the \\"IT\\" book that everyone is talking about, as often the hype is bigger and better than the book. In this case I think it is. There is only one reason I can see why this book is the talk of the town, whether you love it or hate it - the subject matter of Sex is making it something it maybe shouldn't be.<br /><br />When I was at school as a teenager the must have book was Judy Blume's Fovever. Ralf (you must have read the book to know what I am talking about!!) was our introduction to sex - it was a must read for all young teenage girls and whilst Fifty Shades is MUCH more graphic and in some places ridiculous and dark it will be the book that young girls read. Do I agree they should, as a Mother of a daughter, no I don't think they should one two counts. It paints an unrealistic picture of sex and the response of a female body (I think you know what I mean - it doesn't happen the first and every time - unless you are extremely lucky!!) and also it paints a very horrid picture of what a man can be like.<br /><br />I can't comment on whether it is written well or not as I'm not a writer and there for am not qualified to judge. I found elements repetitive and almost like the Author wanted to write about darkest sides of sex and domination and then added a story around it which was weak in places.<br /><br />Did I enjoy - yes, I was addicted to it and I think that is more because of the subject matter. Do I agree it is the best book of 2012, by no means no. It is the \\"IT\\" book and I understand from both sides of what people are saying. Some love it, some hate it and I can agree with both. What I do know is that I couldn't put it down and if I am honest, I'm a little disappointed in my reaction!<br /><br />Will I read the other two books in the trilogy  - probably not unless someone lends them to me. I won't be going out of my way to buy them for myself. I have never had so many texts from friends asking if I have read a book and if I have it can they borrow it. Amazing what publicity good and bad can do for a average book isn't it! I take my hat off to the Author  - this is no way near the quality and standard of  Harry Potter but as each of us have a view of the book, another handful of £'s are going into the Authors purse so I am guessing our reviews no longer matter!

B007J4T2G8|2.0|I was so excited about this \\"fabulous\\" book that patrons kept waxing about. The holds list was extremely long, so I decided to go ahead and pony up the $10 to own the kindle version. I sincerely wish I had went for the paperback so I could at least get $3.50 back from Amazon. I actually made myself read the whole book in it's entirety to make sure I could give it an honest review. I, personally, didn't mind the style of writing. I thought the author did a great job on creating the characters, etc. especially considering it's based off the Twilight series.  Christian Grey is definitely an Edward in the sense of good looking, wealthy and controlling, but that's where it stops. He was often extremely abusive of Anastasia Steele (who definitely does not reflect her last name) to the point that I was in tears - ready to rip through the pages and smack the living snot out of him. It was like watching your friend get beat every day and yet she continues to go back to her husband because really he's a wonderful misunderstood person that can make her orgasm with meer words. Are you serious?! Then there is the whole \\"Mrs. Robinson\\" idea. (Cue the music!) Anastasia is sickened and appalled that Christian was molested by an older woman as a young teen (he was the older woman's submissive), but she's totally okay with him mistreating her? She hates that he's had other submissives, but she's fine with being another submissive that's in it just for the sex? Yet, there are parts that are sweet and wonderful and make you smile but don't blink or you'll miss them. This book is a love/hate relationship. You'll love certain aspects of it, but then hate how stupid (previously virginal) Anastasia can be in staying with a sick-minded, abusive, sadistic billionaire. OH, and don't get me started on the contract that was supposedly recommended and drawn up by Christian's lawyer. Really? That by far was the funniest part of the book. If this book had more tenderness and less abuse, I would have loved it.  Will I purchase and read the other two books in the series - likely not! I don't care if Christian acts like Mother Teresa by book three and Anastasia develops a backbone - a relationship built on nothing more than violent sex within days of knowing each other is just too much. However, based on what I've read in this book, I'm betting that Christian's past is revealed and healed, Anastasia does grow a back bone and somehow they work out all their issues and fall madly in love. They'll have a baby (because we have to have a Renesme) and live happily ever after. It has to follow the Twilight series and end with a Breaking Dawn ending, right?ve loved it.

1845761502|5.0|This is quite a massive and top quality book. The pictures and imformation are wonderful.<br />The one gripe I have is that there is not much coverage on some of the studios not so<br />popular movies, Pumpkin Head & Relic to name a few. These were great creatures and just as good as<br />the dino's in J.P.<br />That is only minor though and does not distract from it being a Fantastic book.

B005NGKMOU|5.0|\\"Blackthorn\\" is a rare film - a 21st century western made with all of the expertise & cinematic excellence of the great western directors of the 20th century. This is the sort of western that the great John Ford would have put his brand on. \\"Blackthorn\\" is simply the best western I have seen in 20 years, and it succeeds at every level. It has a great cast - Shepard, Noreaga & Rea are all exceptional (although I think Rea outshines Shepard in the scenes they share) - the cinematography outstanding (reminiscent of Dean Semmler's work in \\"Dances With Wolves\\"), the direction precise &  faultless, & with a storyline that keeps us locked into the story right up until the end. And the few songs included in the soundtrack are complete gems & totally suited to the time & storyline. This is how great westerns used to be made, and how they should still be made today.

B0083GPDBO|4.0|We all know that with CG there isn't anything imaginable that can't be portrayed on screen, but Chronicle over does it.  Don't get me wrong, I actually liked this movie.  At least, the first 1/3 of it.  It had a good plot, it was making sense, I could empathize with how the \\"super powers\\" the boy's received could grow into something too strong for them to contain... and then it went all Hollywood hype with major destruction, big explosions, cars getting thrown and windows exploding.  All I kept thinking was... how hard could it possibly be to just shoot the one out of control in the head (SWAT was there, but they were more like kindergartners scared of the Bogey man instead of trained assassins)?  So it lost me with the Hollywood hyped up CG stuff at the end, because the movie makers decided that it was more important to blow things up than continue the progression of this storyline.  Basically, (as with most new movies) the ending sucked!
006091307X|2.0|The Crying of Lot `49<br /><br />I gave up on this novella, a volume Time magazine included in its list of 100 best English-language novels (1923-2005), about halfway. I did not find it enjoyable because I did not really understand it - and I do not think I was supposed to. There were a couple of funny bits - the characters' names are humourous; Oedipa Mass, Mike Fallopian, Genghis Cohen - and it is well written, but it is a head trip; it is phantasmagorical, like a David Lynch screenplay buffed up and amended by conspiracy theory nutters like Jesse Ventura. But it is literary; I will concede that.<br /><br />The \\"plot\\" revolves around Oedipa Mass, a housewife from the Bay Area who uncovers, or so we think, or maybe, or who knows?, an international conspiracy involving a clandestine underground postal system. The book is characterized by odd characters, esoteric symbols, and eccentric snippets of dialogue, but it is, in my opinion, weird for weird's sake. Not that it needs my stamp of approval. Pynchon is legendary, more so because he does not and has not made public appearances.<br /><br />I enjoy comic novels - I like Kurt Vonnegut, for instance - so I thought I would like this book more. It is certainly interesting; I just did not find it pleasurable. If you are wondering whether you ought to read it, you may as well. It is only 183 pages long.<br /><br />Or is it?<br /><br />Troy Parfitt is the author of Why China Will Never Rule the World?

B00005JG6Q|5.0|Excellent film that takes you through a post World War Three Neo-Tokyo. Kaneda and Tetsuo are the main characters and their rivalry/friendship drives the movie forward. The story is great and I remember starting this movie and then wanting to read the Manga, which is slightly different but still enthralling and epic. Overall it was a sensory journey through the streets of war ravaged people and government oppression.
6305531412|5.0|As of today, there are many live action/animation movies out there.  But none can match the sheer brilliance of 'Roger Rabbit'.  Even with all the new technology we have today, 'Roger Rabbit' still surpasses them. I don't know if it's lack of really good story telling or the lack of really good actors.(Perhaps a little of both?)<br />Made in the 80's and set in the 40's, 'Roger Rabbit' drew you in and for a couple of hours, could make you suspend belief.  From live action to the animation, these perfect cast of actors portrayed their characters in a seamless fashion.  They actually made you believe we could interact with these animated characters; characters that we are very familiar with such as Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny and many other Looney Tunes and Disney characters.  This movie dealt with the scandals of Hollywood while cleverly mixing in genius animation, making it a classic for any one, young or old, to enjoy.<br />Who doesn't love that goofy Roger Rabbit, who was able to win over the gorgeous Jessica (and even the heart of that 'sour-puss', Eddie Valiant)?<br />I've seen quite a few 1 star ratings, not for the movie but the DVD. People, if you have a problem with the DVD, contact the seller or the manufacturer. These reviews and ratings are strictly for how you felt about the movie, not the package it came in.  If you loved it that much, give the movie its rightful stars.

B0050PYNP8|5.0|One of the most enjoyable movies I've ever seen!  Laugh out loud hilarious!  I can't remember when I ever enjoyed a movie more!<br /><br />Paul is a foul mouthed alien from another planet who smokes cigarettes and wears flip flops.  He seems so human, despite his totally alien appearance.<br /><br />Paul escapes from a government facility and hitches a ride with a couple of comic book nerds and a buddy/road trip/science fiction adventure begins.  It's an adventure you don't want to miss.<br /><br />And although there are MANY parts of this movie that I absolutley LOVED, the one that keeps coming to my mind over and over again the one where Paul and the two comic book geeks get into a debate over Evolution vs Intelligent Design with a young earth creationist.<br /><br />You HAVE TO see this scene!  It is BRILLIANT!!!
B000002KIE|1.0|The Sex Pistols were a manufactured band, just like The Monkees. How sad that so many people fell for it. Rotten (Lydon) himself said at the first and last US gig \\"Don't you people even know when you're being had?\\" At least The Monkees had talent. This was all attitude and theater not music. This crap has simply not become part of the cultural landscape because it lacks that esssential pre-requisite; talent. These no-talent yobs were merely an invention of their Svengali puppet-master Malcolm McLaren.
1936891026|1.0|I read the reviews on this book and was pretty excited. Well, I'm very disappointed.

B005LAII08|4.0|The princess Merida is a teen with a mind of her own, wild red hair and \\"tomboy\\" ways struggling against her mom's constant lessons on how to behave like a proper/perfect princess. When her parents offer her hand in marriage to strangers, she runs off and ends up meeting a witch. She buys a spell to \\"change her mother\\" and it unexpectedly turns her mom into a bear. (And in turn, her 3 little brothers who get into the leftover spell which was disguised as a pie).  Merida has to keep everyone from killing her mom while trying to break the spell.<br /><br />There's a bit of fun to her trying to teach her mom to fish like a bear - but also moments where the mom stops being mom as a bear, and becomes just a dangerous bear for a bit.<br /><br />AWESOME animation -- happy to have another story for the girls to encourage non-princess behavior (sports, independance etc.) instead of looking pretty and marrying a prince to live happily ever after - not so big on the give your mom a spell idea - but lessons are learned and all is well in the end. The 3 little redheaded boys are cute/fun little devils.<br /><br />I heard a few laughs from the parents and didn't hear anything from the kids that would indicate it was too scary for them, or boring - most seemed pretty glued to their seats.  But the accents might make this a little bit difficult to understand for some.<br /><br />Overall, another good movie from Pixar! (Even better if you didn't see the trailers)<br /><br />Personally though, this is not one I'd want to watch over and over (like some of the animated movies) so I probably won't buy it - but you should enjoy it at least the first time.

B00003CWOL|5.0|I've been a huge fan of both George Carlin and Janeane Garofalo, so you'd think when this movie originally came out I'd be one of the first people in line to see it.<br /><br />But for some strange reason I didn't see it in the theatre, and when it came out on DVD I just never got around to buying it (or even renting it).<br /><br />So, here it is approximately a dozen years later and I've FINALLY seen it, and it was FANTASTIC!  One of the best movies ever!!<br /><br />And while both George Carlin and Janeane Garofalo were great in this move, my favorite lines actually came from an actor that I had totally ignored up until this point.  I am speaking of course about Alan Rickman, who played a crusty and very annoyed Angel.  Rickman's performance of this long suffering and much complaining Angel was FANTASTIC with an excellent mix of irony, dry humor, and compassion.<br /><br />I will watch this movie again and again and again and again.  It is JUST THAT GOOD!!
B007I2BZIE|5.0|If this album had been recorded by Green Day or My Chemical Romance, it would be up for album of the year and walk away with several Grammies. It sure took long enough to write and produce (plus some testing of the waters through tracks on Snakes and Arrows), but the final product speaks for itself. The Three Guys really pulled off a masterpiece that I'm still digesting and growing into.<br /><br />It's become somewhat an anti-establishment badge of honor that the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame to keep eschewing Rush (kind of like Clint Eastwood not having a star on the Walk of Fame), but the irony is that Clockwork Angels is the poster child, concept album the R&R Hall of Fame \\"claims\\" makes the band inaccessible - and yet this album is nearly impossible not to love. Things are going to get very interesting as this beast settles into the music world. In any case, the current CWA tour should blow even the unbelievable Time Machine tour away.
0553807919|5.0|This book has great strategies to help deal with your children.  I have 2 kids that have different needs.  one is ADD and the other has some other learning issues.  This book helped me to understand what is going on in their mind and gave me ideas to help parent them.  It has proven to be a very helpful book and easy to follow and implement.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|There is nothing on television more suspenseful, better acted, brilliantly written or executed than Breaking Bad. The finale of Season 4 left us gasping.  We can't wait for the season opener on July 15. What in the world will Walt do now??  Counting down the days to find out.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|best game ever its super addicting I haven't played Oregon trail since I was little this game is definetly an upgrade
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Has the same mysterious feel as Alien and trills as Aliens. Even though I'm obviously comparing these because it's \\"sort of a prequel\\". I found it much like the Aliens, but with a slightly different approach. I really loved this movie. SO. MUCH D:

B007I2BZIE|2.0|I had originally written a review of this album and took it down to revise it.<br /><br />First of all, I am a long-time Rush fan.  I know each and every time Rush come out with an album, there are going to be people who will defend every single note, drum fill, nuance, equalizer setting, and bass pedal push that Rush does.  If you're here to trash me for what I'm going to say about this album, rest assured you will likely not be pleased and will be cracking your fingers to tell me that I don't know how to write a review, it's the best album ever and how dare I criticize Rush, and so forth.  If you're going to do that, save your time and don't bother to post a rebuttal.  Save your smug and nasty comments for someone else.<br /><br />I originally said it sounded too close to the Foo Fighters or Queens of the Stone Age.  I am incorrect on that, as Rush has influenced the Foo Fighters and many other bands for decades - always good to respect your forebears.<br /><br />Here is the main problem with Clockwork Angels: there are some songs you can easily identify Rush and are a joy to listen to.  \\"Caravan\\" and \\"Headlong Flight\\" fit that category.  The others, however, range from \\"just okay\\" to \\"meh\\" to \\"you've got to be kidding, right?\\" to \\"ugh, I can't wait to get this off my MP3 player!\\"<br /><br />Other reviewers have said, \\"ooh, you have to listen to it several times to let it grow on you!\\"  I disagree wholly: for me, thw whole steampunk concept brings this album down, and while the theme of \\"individual vs. the establishment\\" is appreciated, I don't see it fitting.<br /><br />And you can't blame the producer (\\"Bajooze\\") or the lyricist (Neil Peart) here.  They did their best to make a follow-up to Snakes and Arrows (which is a better album, in my honest opinion), but this isn't it.
B008COD5OO|3.0|Low quality rental stream, buy the dvd if you'd rather have a good picture, nice surround sound though, am I suppose to rate the movie?? oops
B0084IG8TM|4.0|I wasn't excited this was going to be made into a movie, but I wasn't surprised.  I read the books a few years ago, and enjoyed the first two.  However, I was convinced to see it.  I was worried it would get the Twilight treatment, reducing it to nothing more than teenage fluff.  However, maybe because I expected so little amid the hype, I was impressed.  It is quite faithful to the books, and does a good job of translating the action of the arena into a PG-13 movie.  I don't really enjoy Elizabeth Banks as Effie or Donald Sutherland as President Snow, but most of the other casting choices worked well.  Also, the movie doesn't spend much time (hardly any really) providing information about the different districts, which is a great part of the book.  But, it stays parallel to the book otherwise.  Most people who haven't read the books may not like it, but it is about time fans who read have their own special movie.
B0055SWM08|5.0|When I first saw this game I thought it looked stupid for 99 cents but when it was the free app of the day I got it right then. I give this game 5 stars mostly because it is very addicting.

B004CLYKLI|3.0|I purchased this book because I respect Amy Chua's accomplishments. I was impressed by her book World on Fire: How Exporting Free Market Democracy Breeds Ethnic Hatred and Global Instability. I thought such an intelligent woman must have something intelligent to say about parenting. I therefore purchased the book because I wanted to read what Chua had to say about parenting.<br /><br />I did not find the book offensive as many had. Chua wrote about her personal experiences as a child and as a parent. I took away some wisdom from her such as having high expectations of my children and being more in control as a parent. The degree of control that we exert on our children is of course up to us.<br /><br />I believe that there are some cultural differences that may be misunderstood. Asians tend to under praise in order to encourage whereas western culture tend to praise in order to encourage.<br /><br />Overall, I found the book enjoyable and humorous in many ways.
B000O8OTNC|1.0|Dont be fooled by the high rating on this item. this thing sucks. you can literally sit there grinding your knifes away without ever seeing any progress or improvement on the sharpness of your blade. in fact it will be much more dull than ever. luckily the knives i tried this thing on are inexpensive. but i am a little pissed though because i had just started collecting knives and the few that i had i wanted to give them a good sharp edge and instead i ended up with a collection of butter knives! RIP my little friends :(

B007ZGO7EM|1.0|DL this as a daily &#733;free&quot; app, but the adverts at the top of the screen make this ugly,  annoying,  and ultimately unusable.
B0073PPKNM|5.0|I was surprised to read so many reviews amounting to feelings of deception or even betrayal, as if an artist must forever remain within the confines of a past work. Such reviews seem to be more-so knee-jerk reactions and unfairly exaggerate the musical differences between this album and those prior. It doesn't seem possible to have enjoyed Melody's first two endeavors and then not have the same admiration for The Absence, which continues precisely in the same vein. For me, this album is a brilliant combination of the more intimate, Worrisome Heart kind of song, and the more bold, theatrical My One and Only Thrill kind of song. Which is a relief, since especially with the latter type of music it can all fall into silly melodrama for me.<br /><br />The new element that The Absence introduces into Melody's work is the lighthearted, which unfortunately seems to have been what critics have found unpalatable. And that is a real shame. If you can permit yourself that kind of cheerful spirit, I think it will be hard not to come away thinking this a masterpiece.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I love playing this while traveling.  Just found out it is a limited version.  I would like more features like the Zen garden and more levels for quick play.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|love this app.  its fast accurate and easy to use.  I use it for all my needs even balancing my checkbook
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I watched this movie from church. I must say that this is not the typical end of the world, evangelistic, Christian film that I have watched before. This movie is a combination of comedy, action, heart warming and touching movie. I think this will gos to my favorites list. I even got seven copies to be given to my colleagues at work. You will learn a lot of lesson from parental love, fatherly love and the love for God. I deeply admire the characters portrayed and the heart warming scene of the father dancing for his daughter. I also like the funny scenes. A must see movie indeed! But as of to date I am still waiting for my orders to arrive.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Just what I like and expected from John Grisham; the story moves right along, easy to read and likeable characters.  However, unlike past novels this one didn't have much depth to it's story.
B003O97W5K|3.0|This is another one of those films that came out when I was in the Air Force at Hickam AFB, Hawaii.  To me, all the very best movies were released in the eighties because  we finally got past all that cheesiness of the campyness of the seventies, and this was before computer animation and CGI started to reduce the integrity of special effects that made more recently films look so cartoonish.<br /><br />What really gives me the chills about this film is, although I came from some pretty frightening, nightmarish neighborhoods of Detroit, while I was in Hawaii, I started to see the beauty of the modern day home design and construction, and when I finally got stationed in Northern California, this development of Cueste Verde looks a lot like the neighborhoods of Vacaville, California (about 50 miles from San Francisco), so watching this film again since I've been in California, has given this film a whole new sense of terror to me.<br /><br />The classic \\"haunted house\\" of film's past usually look more like some hundred year old house.  But this film makes the modern day house look like it can be haunted too.  Whenever I drive through Vacaville, I am reminded of this film.<br /><br />It is also amazing that even though this film is only 30 years old, it's interesting how so many of the actors and actresses in this film are already dead and gone.  Even Heather O'Rourke (who played 4 year old Carol Anne), is dead and gone.<br /><br />Yeah, I'll have to say that this film has some stronger means of terrifying me more than just being a haunted house film.  I feel like this can happen even in my own neighborhood.  Thank you Steven Spielberg for putting classic horror in a modern day reality setting.<br /><br />But, because this film came out in the early eighties, it remains one of my favorites to remind me of my wonderful military days.<br /><br />When I think of \\"Poltergeist\\", I think of Hickam Air Force Base, and the black haired beauty I took to the theatre with me when I first saw this movie.I first saw this movie.
B0018QQQKS|4.0|Fergusson tells a fascinating story of the rise of various financial instruments over the history of the world. He relates finance to the success, and just as often failure, of induviduals and nations. I found the part up until the first world war the most interesting, seeing as it was much unkown to me beforehand. Thereafter the author offers some interesting perspectives on modern welfare states and on the, at the time of writing, emerging financial crisis of 2007 and early 2008. However, the book should be read for an exploration of the history of money and not for an analysis of contemporary events.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|This extender is a lifesaver for me! I have a Speck Candyshell case and without this I can't charge my Iphone 4S on my alarm clock. I've also bought a second one for my son to use with his Iphone 4. He has used his with an Otterbox Defender case and now the Speck Toughskin case.
0439023513|3.0|Like many readers I was disappointed in the conclusion to this trilogy.  But it's not, like many have written, because it lacks a storybook ending.  Such endings rarely occur in real life and I neither expected nor hoped for one in this case.  My frustration with the series is that, although the author started out with an excellent premise, she failed in book 2 and especially in book 3 to maintain the quality of writing she delivered earlier.  I'd hoped that in book 3 (unlike in book 2) we'd get more details into major characters, the districts, the revolt, etc... but once again she failed to deliver.<br /><br />(WARNING - some spoilers follow so you may not want to read if you haven't finished the book.)<br /><br />I'd like to have had some details of how the Districts successfully rose up against the Capitol but we got next to nothing.  As in book 2 when we're told that all the Districts but District 2 have been taken by the rebels (with no details on how this happened), here we're told after the fact that the rebellion was successful and President Snow is in custody.  How did the rebels overrun the Capitol, how did they capture the President, will we get to hear the President's defense?  Of course not.<br /><br />We have major characters like Finnick involved in mortal combat with creations of the Capitol and we get no details on the battles.  In fact, once again we're only told after the fact that he didn't make it or that another character sacrificed his or her life for the cause.<br /><br />We plod through Katniss' thoughts as she lives in solitary confinement, contemplating suicide, not knowing she is on trial and even after finding out with no explanation of the process, what occurred or even any understanding of why she is not allowed to participate in her own defense.<br /><br />I recognize that excessive violence is a concern in any YA novel and maybe that's behind some of the lack of detail but the battles and violence in this novel don't even approach those found in a standard video game.  And the overall lack of detail throughout the story does a disservice to the reader.  Looking back, considering that these three novels combined exceed 1100 pages in length, what could have been far, far exceeds what the author actually delivered.  And that's a shame.
B0074EIQUG|4.0|I was relieved to read two other reviewers comment on the sound quality of the Dr. John's \\"Locked Down\\" and that it wasn't just me or my disc.  There is a noticible lack of clarity in the playback, which had me twiddling bass and treble knobs to no avail.  Very tinny.  This is a real shame for an album which has been so well received. I believe producer Dan Auerbach would have done his idol more justice by insuring better sound reproduction in the end product.<br /><br />That letdown aside, I like \\"Locked Down\\" very much.  I enjoyed the varied instrumental experimentation.  Auerbach put in his personal touches without taking over the recording. He takes the venerable Doc in some varied directions, yet still leaving him to do that voodoo that he do so well.  In command of the keyboard(s) and growling his way through a gumbo of social commentary, personal introspection and just plain \\"fonk\\"; Dr. John has cranked out a very satisfying and accomplished collection of music.<br /><br />It would be interesting to know if the vinyl version suffers from the same audio defect.  Has anyone heard it?
0785152458|4.0|David Lizewski/Kick Ass is being trained by Mindy/Hit Girl to become a better superhero but when Hit Girl is dissuaded from putting on her outfit and bloodying up criminals by her new step-father and recently re-united mother, Kick Ass sets off to meet others who are dressing up and fighting crime. And it turns out there's a few, so many that they wind up making the first \\"real-world\\" superhero team, Justice Forever. But things are about to get shaken up by Red Mist who is gathering an army to exact revenge on Kick Ass for his father's death.<br /><br />I remember really enjoying the first book and Mark Millar is usually an interesting writer so I was surprised to find myself not falling for this book as completely as I did the first. It might be because of a couple of things: there's a lot less humour and fun in the book, and it's very dark. Whereas the first book contained some of the thrill of a buttoned-down boy finding freedom of self through a secret identity, here he is beset by tragedy again and again. Kick Ass learns that like many costumed vigilantes, he must endure great personal suffering for his choice of putting on a mask. And these tragedies are very dark and graphic so be warned; Millar has always had a tendency to shock and he doesn't pull his punches here.<br /><br />I think the irony of the series is that Millar presented Kick Ass as a semi-plausible story of a young boy setting out to be a superhero without superpowers and thus becoming a different kind of \\"hero\\" journey not seen before, and yet time after time in this book the story falls back on comic-book archetypes and clich&eacute;s. The way the hero loses close friends and family mirrors numerous superheroes; the way the bad guy plots to blow up the city and does any number of heinous things including murder and rape; the way the hero is perceived as a villain by those he protects; by the end of the book it's no longer a singular post-modern superhero story but just another superhero story, indistinguishable from a Batman or Spiderman book.<br /><br />That said, while I found the plot a bit predictable, I began thinking about the meaning of the scenes and wondering why they were included. I think at its core, Kick Ass is a way of looking at superhero comics and their meaning on a broader scale. It could even be said of the world presented in Kick Ass that we are in the post-superhero age; where everyone wants to be and is a superhero but no-one truly is - at least not in the comic-book sense.<br /><br />Millar makes a point of defining what he believes a superhero is: it's not just putting on a costume and beating up criminals (although that is part of it) but it could also be as simple as helping out at a homeless shelter or donating blood. The fact that they wear a mask when they do these things is irrelevant. In that definition, like many things in Kick Ass, Millar is saying we can all be superheroes if we want - a better world is within our grasp even if we need to re-phrase the actions with the help of colourful outfits.<br /><br />I'm divided in my view of the book. On the one hand I feel the series has become a product of the thing he sought to parody and in the other I have the nagging suspicion that this is all designed to appear that way and that this is a truly post-modern superhero comic with many layers. On a purely superficial level, did I enjoy reading it? Sure, it's good, bloody, fun and while not all fans of the first book might like this second as much, there's enough here to make it worth your time and the fact that the book has left me pondering its meaning this much is something few comics manage. So I tentatively recommend it with the caveat that you go in with lowered expectations and with both eyes open for the meaning in the spaces in between the panels.tinguishable from a Batman or Spiderman book.<br /><br />That said, while I found the plot a bit predictable, I began thinking about the meaning of the scenes and wondering why they were included.

B004GYY714|5.0|The app is very easy to use. I luv the related music choose. This is a great app.  I use it while walking and motorcycle rides.
B00846F1YW|3.0|Too hard to see on the kindle fire. There is no bypass on puzzles which would be nice since there are some puzzles I don't want to bother with. I do enjoy the game inspite of this.
B0081KTI0E|4.0|Rated R and rightfully so. Scared the heck out of me and well worth seeing if u LOVE GHOST stories. I love Ghost stories and this was very well done and full of one ghost who put me so much on edge ,I did not sleep after watching the movie.<br />NOT FOR anyone under age 16
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|Just to make sure people understand...these songs are not sung by the original artists. This is very much like an extended episode of Glee, but with a HUGE budget. I mean that in the best possible way.<br /><br />I was 17 years old during this time period, so every single song in this movie brings back intense memories, both good and bad. Even Tom Cruise is amazing, and I hate him. (I mean, how could I think Nicole Kidman hung the moon and still like Tom Cruise, right?) By the way, the movie is very energizing. It is very tongue in cheek and pokes fun of everything that was the late 80s without being hostile. It's all about the memories! If your teens have any interest in what life was like for you back then, this movie would be a great way to show them. Don't be afraid to really enjoy this movie. I laughed so hard at many parts where I was the only one that laughed out loud, and I didn't care. I threw myself into the movie.<br /><br />Okay, back to the music. If you extract this music from the movie, you're left with a very Glee-like album. If you like the style of Glee, you'll like this CD. If you don't care for Glee but love music and memories, this is definitely worth giving a shot. Listen to the samples. If they stir anything inside you, buy the album.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I rarely play games like this but I am hooked on this one! And it is simple enough for a game-illiterate person to understand! Thanks!
B007SGM084|5.0|I couldn't put it down. The suspense of not knowing what was going to happen next kept me caught up in it. It's not for the timid or closed minded person. You have to be willing to open your mind and let yourself wonder in the book. I truly enjoyed it and would read it again.......

B0073LWEXK|5.0|After enjoying grisly manor, we tried this one, and enjoyed it even more. The graphics were beautiful, the challenge was perfect (we only got stuck once, and the  built-in hint guide helped us through that), and the clever season-based puzzles were creative and fun. The game only took a couple hours, but it was perfect for an enjoyable evening playing through with my wife. I look forward to more of these from fire maple!
B003ES61EE|2.0|The brush on the end is made of very fine and soft bristles. The back side is made of a very soft felt and comes in a triangle and circle shape. After a year or so of owning I have to say that the only thing that bothers me is that the felt tips will NOT stay in the pen. At least not while being carried around in your pocket or a bag. It's very frustrating that you have to look for this piece every time you go to use the pen. This is so frustrating that it's the reason I'm giving it a poor mark. Otherwise it's a great cleaning tool. If you don't plan on carrying this around in your pocket, loose in a bag or in a slot for a writing pen in a bag then this is a great item.
B00785P2QC|4.0|the game is a lot of fun I just started playing it but it reminds me of Sim city. I do wish you didn't have to pay to advance
B00785P2QC|4.0|great game but it rushes u a little bit its still fun I don't know wat to say just get the app and if u don't like it delete it simple as that there now decide
B0023SDPS6|4.0|When a corpse turns out to be a man the sheriff tangled with some years back, you know the story's going to hold your attention. Especially when the victim was one of three boys tried for the rape of a Cheyenne girl who suffered from fetal alcoholic syndrome. The three were basically acquitted.<br /><br />The sheriff is a grieving widower, his best friend's a Cheyenne related to the girl, and his mentor is his predecessor, a retired one-legged sheriff living in a nursing home. Adding to the ambience, a local woman-made-good back in town is eyeing him.<br /><br />I confess I began to suspect the murderer about half-way through but this still kept me interested. The history, of the native Americans in Wyoming and the Sharps rifle, are blended in, letting me learn probably more than I wanted to. But it was entertaining learning so I didn't mind.<br /><br />Most of the characters, especially the sheriff and his best friend, are vividly drawn.<br /><br />A nice easy entertaining read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i love this book it is very good suzanne collins has done it again read the the title if you play r o b l o x  and like it
B0058VW36U|5.0|Amazingly entertaining game! Really wish there were more updates though:( The ones it has so far are the cardboard, felt, foil, valentine, magic, space, tool, bee, gift, and dj boxes. Each has 20 or 30 levels on it (I forget how many exactly) and each also introduces a new object for use. I highly recommend this game.
B008CPZNL6|4.0|The application works great. It has support for a ton of different news/networking sites. The only downfall is adding a Google account on the KindleFire seems impossible. The Sign In button doesn't respond to anything, which is incredibly frustrating. I look forward to that being fixed.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I purchased this headset back in February of 2011, and let me say that it's been a great experience due to the consistent performance of this quality product. The Dolby 7.1 surround sound is perfect, and blows my previous Plantronics Gamecom 777 headset clear out of the water. The only complaint I even have about this headset is the fact that I have had two friends complain of problems with their battery life after the first year of using this headset, although two other friends and I have had no problems regarding battery life to date. Overall the G930 is an awesome headset and I'd definitely recommend buying one if you're looking for a fantastic gaming headset.

B000WFBC6E|1.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2AOJP2PTUEQUU]]NOT a Swiss Rail clock, just looks like one.  Key word above is \\"design.\\"<br /><br />I bought this for my husband as a gift on his first Father's Day.  His family is Swiss and we love our experiences with their legendary rail system.  As a focal piece to our newly-remodeled kitchen and a nod to his style and craftsmanship, I thought this would look excellent above the door.<br /><br />Well, I ordered it late and had to settle for a printed version until the package arrived (which it did on time).  He loved the gift and was so excited that he said, \\"finally, a clock that's more solid than just a black square box with a battery on the back!\\"  you know what I mean... standard clock back.  Well, then you can imagine our collective disappointment to discover exactly the poor quality we thought we were avoiding. The face/case is made in China and the clock mechanism (cheap, square, black box) components are made in Germany, neither of which is a problem unless you're expecting the real movement of the Swiss rail clock.  Here is a link to what the swiss rail clocks look like in motion:[...]  The second-hand does not 'tick,' but sweeps through the minute, pausing only at the sixty-second mark -- takes some real clock innards to make that happen.<br /><br />Bottom line: I wouldn't pay more than $25 for the clock sold here (and most of that is just because it looks cool).
B0054JZC6E|5.0|kool and fun I just love the games I would recommend it to smaller kids. I would give it ten stars if there was.

Good (anything by the Beatles was good), but not one of my favorites.<br /><br />Then I read the e-book about the album by Alex Hendler, and it provided me with a whole new appreciation of this album. For example--<br /><br />* the Beatles recorded the album in a single day<br />* because of musicians' union rules they had to work in 3-hour shifts<br />* John was sick as a dog so they left Twist & Shout until the end. (Explains why the vocal is so raw - and incredible).<br />* They recorded everything live. No multiple tracks like they do today. \\"Boys\\" they did in one take. That's Ringo playing drums and singing simultaneously, and they got it in one take.<br /><br />So, yes, 5 stars for an incredible performance under strenuous circumstances. I highly recommend checking out the e-book. They sell it on Amazon. It's a quick read, and will give you a better understanding of why this album is as good as it is.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B008CGEXSO Please Please Me]]
B007RKPO84|5.0|As other reviewers have said, Kreator has been on a great upward swing in the last 10+ years. I'm a fan of all of Kreator's music, even when they got experimental in the 90s. I believe that because of that experimenting we have been blown away by the likes of Violent Revolution, Enemy of God, Hordes of Chaos and now this splendid gem: Phantom Antichrist.<br /><br />If you were a fan of any of their three previous albums during the 2000s, you will love Phantom Antichrist. As always Kreator has perfectly blended Mille's angry/coarse vocals (with some occasional cleaner/spoken word singing) along with catchy, faster than light, bone crunching riffs with beautiful, technical soloing and the earth shaking double bass drumming provided by the legendary Ventor. Kreator is one of those bands that seems to have 9-10 tracks on each album and each track has \\"it's place\\". It's like Kreator has found this perfect recipe for a Kreator album and they follow it religiously and have been hitting grand slam after grand slam. For the record, Mille is one of those singers who's vocals don't seem to fade at all with time.<br /><br />I last saw Kreator during the Hordes of Chaos tour and while first time through an album I have to get used to the fact that it's the \\"new stuff\\", I will guarantee if there is a song you're not necessarily thrilled with (for instance, Warcurse off of HoC wasn't my favorite first time through) once it's heard live and you go back to hear it again you realize just how amazing it really is. It's still not my favorite, but it is outstanding to me.<br /><br />If you've been a long time Kreator fan, you'll love this album. If you're a dedicated thrash metal fan, this is the epitome of thrash metal. If you're looking for a band that may be \\"new\\" to you (although 30 years old to many) you definitely need to check out Kreator's Phantom Antichrist.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|If you have ever had a dog to love, you will find pieces of him or her in Enzo. He is an intelligent, philosophical dog who would be only too happy to speak to his master, Denny, except that his dog tongue does not allow him to form the words. So he gestures, sometimes melodramatically by his own admission, in order to communicate. Who hasn't seen his dog do the very same thing? Dogs can certainly get their points across when they need to. Enzo's narrative adds the thought process behind the gestures.<br /><br />This book will make you cry. It will also make you smile. But it's not \\"Marley and Me\\" by any stretch; it's more thoughtfully put. Enzo, a family dog who has lived a full life, is preparing to die, and he narrates the story of his life with his family. He has educated himself by watching lots of TV and believes he has found the meaning of a dog's life in a documentary on Nat-Geo about Mongolia. In it he learns that when a dog dies, if he is well prepared, he can go on to be reincarnated as a person. This is Enzo's dearest wish and he believes he is ready.<br /><br />The book is full of drama. The master, Denny, is plagued by more grief than most of us could bear. His one constant throughout it all is Enzo, who learns how complex human emotions are and sometimes questions if being human is too much to aspire to.<br /><br />Without giving away the ending, I will say two things: 1. Have a box of kleenex on hand, because you're going to need it, and 2. you will be well satisfied. You're also going to hug your dog.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|I really enjoyed this read but the codas knocked the score down a whole one star. The first coda was completely uninteresting. The second was decent and the third was just ok. It seems the trite that Scalzi was mocking finally caught up to him. Still, I recommend this for the first 75% of the book, where possibly Scalzi might have been better off ending the book. Because it sure felt like it was over.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book was boring.  I  have twenty  words to say about it.  It was a detailed  instruction book  in how to have sex in a dominant and a passive relationship or sado-masichistic.
145551389X|5.0|Gaga X Terry Richardson really shows Gaga at her best. All the photos portrayed in this picture book are so real and so her that there is nothing fake in the pages at all! Throughout the book you will be taken on a journey through her Monster Ball, to the recording of her Smash Born This Way album, and just some silly moments with Gaga, Terry, Her Parents, and Her Friends and Crew. The book shows what an artistic, creative, genius she truly is, and why she was meant to be making music. It is absolutely beautiful!P.S, may not be appropriate for kids under 16.
1451608659|5.0|Diminique has always been my favorite gymnast and when I heard she was writing a book I had to have it. I read it in one day. She sheds light on things that USGA would rather stay hidden. I will be using this book as a resource for my thesis.

0425263908|2.0|Following the recommendations from my many girlfriends, I too decided to join in on the 50 shades phenomen. I don't know if there was too much hype surrounding that book, but it was a huge disappointment. After reading other reviews about Bared and the similarities to 50 shades, I should've known what to expect. While I did find the plot somewhat different (50 shades really played up the s&m theme - Bared only hinted of this with P.G. versions of their escapes....no secret sex rooms or binding contracts about sex and its parameters), I was still disappointed and bored by the end.<br /><br />The relationship between Gideon and Eva was about a real obsession/addiction to one another that hinted at a truly dysfunctional (albeit sexy) type of love. I liked this difference initially, and found it much more realistic than the twisted relationship in 50 Shades. This held my interest  and I was happy with the book until I realized how predictable the plot was becoming. It certainly started as an interesting one...with Gideon and Eva meeting and forming this overwhelming relationship with one another. It was captivating and hot. But when the SAME EXACT scenes played out over and over again, I quickly realized that the extent of the plot had already played out within the first half of the story. I was ready for the ending about half way through and found myself quickly skimming through pages in hopes of something new happening to the characters or to the plot itself. Gideon does something to upset Eva, Eva runs, Gideon chases, they have mind blowing sex and make up. This continues all the way to the end with the last argument proving to be no more pivotol than any of the others.<br /><br />I did find the writing entertaining....the sex scenes were impressive and I found them much more realistic than 50 shades. I just wish the plot took on more of a specific and original climax. Perhaps the next one will allow for some real surprises in both the plot and the characters.
B007WCJSWA|3.0|I enjoy this album.<br />It seems like dejavu as was the case with a few of his recent albums as they all sound the same with the same clichès used and very similar pieces and album structure.<br />The varying personell( not the same group on every track) doesn't change much here.<br />Nonetheless it is enjoyable every time.<br />A nice, pleasant album.<br /><br />An album we hadn't heard before would certainly get him more stars than three in my book.

B006JP11HQ|5.0|This book is a must read for anyone that wants to understand how integral capitalism is to freedom.  Mr. Friedman gives a very balanced argument for capitalism and even discusses some weaknesses in capitalism.  I would strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in understanding the market system and how in most cases a free market system is the best system.
0307593312|1.0|This is a novel where due to the endless repetition one could skip every other paragraph and still follow the storyline. The persistence of repetition could actually be compared to that of the television-fee collector character in the book. It is as though the author wants to collect a fee from the reader, but with no literary services rendered to the latter. The author does attempt to titillate the reader with the sexual escapades of Aomame, one of the main characters in the book, but this only serves to eventually aggravate the reader into expecting more substance and complexity in the story.<br /><br />When reading the first hundred pages, the reviewer was almost led to judge Aomame to be a victim of some kind of cognitive aphasia, and was hoping that the author would utilize some of the recent discoveries in cognitive neuroscience to make her thought patterns interesting (and believable). Instead however the story is subjected to a kind of massive parallelization, where a children's story serves as message passing between the threads, and where the characters' individuality becomes fragmented and the overall theme sophomoric to the core. The novel ends with the dull clich&eacute; of two lovers looking at the moon. It seems that the author grew weary of the writing task, and decided to move on, hopefully to something much, much better.<br /><br />The novel could therefore have been a lot more exciting, and perhaps with a dose of post-modern illumination its contents could be made to say something they do not. Certainly the excision of its repetitious descriptions would reduce its size to less than half of what it is today, namely an object with appreciable gravitational pull, with its best use being one to prop open a door to better literary works.

B00845PV16|3.0|I am thinking I must have seen a different Ghost Rider: SOV movie; the one I just watched was actually really good. I wouldn't call it great by any stretch, but I certainly liked it a lot better than the first one. It was certainly better than most movies broadcast on Sci Fi. I do admit that Nicholas Cage is not my favorite, but he pulled it off in this one. Having said, there was one scene that displayed his overacting neurotic moniker. The special effects, camera work, angles, sound effects were all really well done. I especially like the way the GR was portrayed; more of a supernatural and dare I say \\"demonic\\" feel to it. Certainly worth 4 bucks rental. Heck, I'll even rent it again.
B007P6VLRS|5.0|Thankfully Billy released thirteen awesome songs instead of 45 average songs.  I'd rather see Billy produce thirteen songs that I can't stop listening to, instead of 45 songs that I can't listen to.  The world is a better place because of this decision.<br /><br />New drummer Mike Bryne is incredible - particularly on Quasar.  Mike's style is aggressive and inventive.<br /><br />My two favorites are Violet Rays and Quasar.<br /><br />Congrats to Billy, Nicole, Mike and Jeff - great work!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I came to this music somewhat indirectly.  I very occasionally take in a stage musical--sometimes even on Broadway--but VERY occasionally.  WICKED, now about a decade old, was not really on my radar.  A musical based on Gregory Maguire's revisionist retelling of the OZ tales seemed like a clever enough notion, but not something that I'd rush out to see necessarily.<br /><br />But I am a member of a choral group that specializes in popular material and a few seasons ago, we did a medley of songs from the Stephen Schwartz musical that was skillfully arranged and, I found really quite compelling.  It included \\"No One Mourns the Wicked,\\" \\"Popular,\\" \\"Defying Gravity,\\" and \\"For Good,\\" which made for a piece with plenty of variety but one which also flowed together well.  And, of course, as with any piece of music you spend weeks learning, all those tunes stuck in my brain to the point where I was singing them in the car, in the shower or just about anywhere (even if they were other people's solos).<br /><br />Around the same time, I caught a PBS special featuring Kristin Chenoweth in performance and became a real fan, making sure to buy her solo CDs.  Again--for whatever reason--I put off actually purchasing the cast album.  But it was definitely inching higher up on my list.  Still, if you haven't actually seen the production, are you going to able to follow it all?  And there was the question of whether what had worked well as a five-minute medley would lose its punch when spread over more than an hour.<br /><br />There was no cause for concern, as it turned out.  True the CD did not include an actual summary, but, hey, isn't that what the Internet is for?  It DOES include a complete lyric sheet, which is helpful, but if you don't know what the nature of the \\"Something Baaad\\" (excuse me, \\"BAD\\") that was happening in Oz, for instance, you needed to consult an outside source for that info.  What also helped give me a sense of the actual production was to view the ample YTvideos from both the original and various subsequent productions.<br /><br />Stephen Schwartz's score, I gather, had garnered some criticism for various reasons, one of them being that there weren't that many \\"hummable\\" tunes included in the production.  I don't know about that.  The days of \\"Surrey With the Fringe on Top\\" seem to be long gone, but \\"Popular\\" \\"I'm Not That Girl,\\" or the more uptempo \\"Dancing Through Life,\\" are certainly crowd pleasers--and hummable enough.  Chenowith (as Glinda) and Idina Menzel (as Elphaba, the Wicked Witch)have their share of socko-boffo moments, of course--and I found myself wishing that other talented cast members like Norbert Leo Butz, Christopher Fitzgerald and Michelle Federer had a few more moments to shine, since they are obviously real pros).<br /><br />What I found especially interesting was just how varied Schwartz's score really was.  There are plenty of \\"rock musical elements,\\" especially in the pieces written for Elphaba (\\"Defying Gravity,\\" and \\"No Good Deed Goes Unpunished,\\" for example).  Idina Menzel is just the right singer for this kind of material.  She's got the dramatic sense for them--AND the big voice.  But just as appropriately, Schwartz gives the Wizard, played by song-and-dance veteran Joel Grey, numbers that are suitable for his part AND for his talent.  WICKED is almost a case study in--a historical overview of even--various Broadway styles.<br /><br />My only question now is am I intrigued enough to catch a current production of the musical.  I'm tempted,  but video clips from more recent productions don't seem to have quite the magic this 2003 cast was able to bring to the project.  That may not be fair, really, and it may just be that after listening repeatedly to the original cast, I may not be ready to see or hear anyone other than Chenowith as Glinda or Menzel as Elphaba.<br /><br />But that's the risk when the original cast was so darn good.  And so darn original.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is fun and addicting. the mini games are cute and just a great thing to play. you should buy this game if you like to play cute games
B004NJC0B6|5.0|Ok, so other AC/DC DVD's are better. They all contain Brian Johnson. This is the best 'Bon Scott' DVD available. I know he drank himself to death, but he established a killer sound! This is a great DVD that covers an 80's era.  The only complaint would be the interview segmants, but I love ACDC, They rock!~!!

B001ED7C58|5.0|I bought this album with this super-detailed guide ([[ASIN:B0089MMX38 Twilight Soundtrack Song List]]) to go with it, and I have to say, I still listen to it all the time.  Stephenie Meyer has great taste in music, and the tracks on this album really underscore the movie well, setting the tone and mood for each scene.  I actually learned about a couple of artists I had not heard of because of this soundtrack, which I was impressed with.  As this saga wraps up, we will still have the music to enjoy!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is an amazing book filled with excitiment and adventure. The main character, Katniss Everdeen, has quite a story to tell. Suzanne has done a wonderful job explaining this from Katniss' perspective. I think that this book is perfect for ages 10 and up. Although it can be a bit gory,  I have just recently finished it and am starting the second book in the series (Catching Fire) at the age of ten!(going on eleven) Ayway, I think that this is a great book for readers who are into adventure, excitiment, and a bit of blood and romance. Hope that you enjoy!!!<br />  ~ADELE21

0345803485|1.0|Even a fatansy written by a 40 year old British housewife should have some basis in reality but when Ana makes Christian a full breakfast after their first orgasmic night together and she WARMED up the plates before serving, I laughed outloud.  That's what the housewife would do...not the 21 year old who refers to her vagina repeatedly as \\"down there\\".  Don't be a sheep and follow the herd!  This is so awfully written and unimaginative; all the blushing and lip biting....etc.  One would think that a college senior majoring in literature would have a better vocabulary! It makes me cringe to think how popular this book is -- and the millions this author will make on this sterile trash.

0345803493|1.0|Voltaire once said, \\"Once is philosophy, twice is perversion.\\"  He certainly meant perversion in the least sexual way, but I have to agree.  I read the first book due to all the fan fare.  It was repetitive, but the story was interesting.  This second version is contrived.  There is no story here.  Stop at one.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is by far the most poorly written book I have ever read.  Even the author seems surprised that it has become so popular.  The main male character is a creep, the female is a boring and insipid nerd, and the sex scenes aren't even sexy.  I'm not a prude and I'm not against a racy sex scene here and there, but I ended up skimming through these because they were just so boring.  Honestly - I lose respect for anyone who raves about this trash, I think their own sex lives must need some serious help.
B0086700CM|5.0|I absolutely love this app. It's great on road trips and on the plane. And the best part about it is that it's free! You will want to be care full though because my family was playing it and the spent $20.00 on it. It made me sooooo mad.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book had me within the first 40 pages. I found myself telling my friends and family about it to no end; I would have told them to read it but that would have interrupted me excitedly spoiling the book and giving away all the twists. This was definitely the best book I've read this year, and one of the best works of science fiction I have read. I finished the book a week ago and part of me wants to just start it all over again. Great job Mr Howey it was a pleasure to read!

I will probably be repeating the reviews of many others when I say that the pop culture references added a fun dimension to the story....at first. But there's a point where I'm getting a blow by blow description of the game JOUST, or find myself reading about the character interacting with the movie Wargames that I let out an audible groan. At some points I felt like I had typed 'the 80's' into wikipedia, and had i wanted to read that; well i would :/

I've never listened to this band before buying the album and since the first listen I was already with the catchy choruses on my head, and the lyrics are great. Old-school sound, great voice and AWESOME music.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|Just when you have seen what seems to be the movie's ending...well, the movie continues. When you have see what is likely to be the 2nd ending, it continues into the third. Refreshingly imaginative, if you ask me.<br />I haven't read all previous years of previews, nor do I imagine myself as the first to point this odd 3-ending oddity out...however, I found this approach truly unique & well, \\"rare\\", in the general current movie making mindset. My hat is off to whoever was the final call on this movie's ending.<br />Viewing it today, I am truly surprised there wasn't more favorable \\"critical\\" response from the \\"critics\\" (I.E. bloviated malcontents with no true direction, without the true viewer's perceived pulse nor their affection to current cinema in today's moviemaking wonderland. I.E., hapless idiots living in their own cocoon).<br />Anyway...<br />Not a shocker, honestly. I'm sure they're content to sticking with perpetuating the tried-n-tue bile they receive daily from their publishers/reps/managers & other handlers in their line of \\"work\\". What the hell, they still collect a check in the end.<br />So yeah, anyway, ignoring the stupid hollywood political garbage, I'd bet that the \\"average movie-goer\\" will find this movie appealing on multiple levels. There's the \\"chick flick\\" parts with romance, with the \\"guy to the rescue & impending doom\\", parts with dust, dirt & danger, plus the \\"saving the kid\\" parts with well, the happily ever after part...what's not to like??<br />Jackman, Kidman, the boy & many others performed commanding roles in this movie. You all did an excellent job! You all have my heartfelt gratitude for a job well done! Geez, I'm still blowing dust-boogers from my nose after watching this one. LOL!!
1416550550|4.0|I really enjoyed this multi-generational family saga, especially since it involved a mystery about a character's true origins.  On her 21st birthday in 1930 Australia, Nell is told that the family she was raised with is not her real family.  She was a foundling whom no one claimed off of a ship from England.  This revelation changes the course of the rest of her life as she tries to discover who she is and where she came from.  Upon her death in 2005, her granddaughter Cassandra picks up Nell's trail when she discovers that Nell has left her a cottage in England.  As Cassandra pieces together the clues Nell has left her and other historical evidence that turns up when she arrives in England, the mystery becomes more baffling.<br /><br />The narrative often switches from Nell as a child, Nell in the 1970's, Cassandra in 2005, and the English family in question, the Mountrachets in the first decades of the 20th Century.  This constant change in perspective might turn some readers off, but I didn't have any issue with it.  I felt this style allowed the author to reveal certain aspects of Nell's mystery little by little.  Whether it's a discovery Nell makes when she visits England and purchases the cottage in the 70's or Cassandra's own sleuthing in 2005, the story slowly reveals itself, layer after layer, in a very engaging way.<br /><br />The one flaw that struck me was that the writing was not exceptional.  I found myself scratching my head, questioning certain word choices or wondering why Morton used a particular phrase, which was quite distracting.  I found the fairytales within the book contrived.  Otherwise, I really did like the structure of the novel and the characters Morton developed. She also created great atmosphere and I could visualize the vast grounds of the Blackhurst Estate and the beauty of the gardens she described. I was totally committed to the story and it kept me turning pages to discover the truth about Nell.
1423140591|5.0|it's a great book (for my 12 year old daughter). she loves the series and any like it! the only problem, which has nothing to do with the book, was that she already has the book! doh! will make a great gift for another of her friends!

1575666286|1.0|To quote the American Cancer Society, \\"evidence does not support claims that Gerson therapy is effective in treating cancer and the principals behind it are not widely accepted by the medical community.\\"<br />The nature of serious cancer demands more than fruit juice. Even the respeced Dr. Wiel, who promotes natural drugs for many maladies says that for some illness, like cancer, we need a \\"strong push,\\" meaning chemo and biological therapies.

B003PIUBZS|1.0|After watching the excellent BBC production Rome seasons 1 and 2, I decided to purchase Spartacus season 1.  And I could not even make it through the first very terrible episode.  Every single scene has this annoying 300 slow-down/speed up cheesy blood effect and the producers didn't even bother shooting anything on scene instead taking the lazy route and using CGI in every background.  There was no outstanding acting like I would expect from something like this.  The show was so despicable I ended up throwing the whole package out my front door.  What a waste of money and time.<br /><br />Don't waste your time with this, either watch BBC's Rome series or watch the 1960's version of Spartacus instead.  This is garbage.

B005LAIHZE|3.0|I haven't read the book yet, but I have been told that the movie departs significantly from it's source. Worth noting for people who are bothered by that sort of thing.<br /><br />The core conceit of this move is patently absurd. One either accepts that going in or just doesn't go to see it. If I was to aim a single criticism at the movie though it would be that it doesn't fully embrace that absurdity.<br /><br />Sometimes it does. There are some epic moments involving silver forks being shot from a canon and young Lincoln leaping from horseback to horseback. But then it goes and gets serious and wants to talk slavery.<br /><br />Still there is a lot of fun to be had. Who doesn't want to see Abraham Lincoln decapitating and maiming the undead in as many different ways as the director can conceive?<br /><br />My second criticism is that the director gets a little too full of his artistic prowess and it's distracting. Animation is thrust into the middle of the film when it's utterly unnecessary, we get endless slow-mo segments and some scenes (particularly the horse stampede scene) where it's really hard to tell what is going on. This is not, after all, an art movie.<br /><br />Criticisms aside there is a lot of fun here too. Endless, gory, vampire killing and a deft weaving of these elements in between some historical fact. If you can suspend your disbelief suitably then watching a 50 something year old Lincoln fight vampires on the roof of a fast moving train is pretty entertaining.<br /><br />So it's a fun movie, but you'd probably be fine picking it up on DVD or Blu-Ray. It could have been better if it hadn't had pretensions to be more than it is.

1609611543|5.0|I read \\"Wheat Belly\\" last Feb. In March I did my nutritional experiment by elimininating 90-95% of processed foods out of my daily menu.  (I hadalready been eating gluten/dairy free since 2007) I was not overweight and exercised several days a week and yet I lost 18lbs and several inches over my whole body.  I am leaner, my waist is 26 inches, and I have an abundance of energy. I have my college age body back again and I am 60+.<br /><br />For me, as an RN/Massage Therapist, using \\"Wheat Belly\\" has a reference in which to share with my clients and friends when they ask me questions re: loosing weight and more importantly, how to get healthier has been helpful and productive.I encourage everyone to read Dr. Davis's book and ponder over it and then look into your mirror and study your reflection. Then decide if your diet needs some adjusting and if you have been lying to yourself re: the foods that you eat daily and then wonder why the weight is slowly creeping up on you again.<br /><br />This book is about the power of the Wheat/Carbs that we eat, the glycemic index, the increase of insulin production, the belly fat and how these foods/functions/reactions create and unhealthy body which results in inflammation, weight gain and then disease.  Enjoy and learn from this read.

B004SGWYW4|5.0|I read the reviews of this movie from several of the other viewers on amazon.  They were correct, this is an excellent horror movie.  It should be catorized as a classic for anime/hentai.<br /><br />This movie has a lot of suspense, horror, and sexapleal.  I literally sat at the edge of my chair through out the entire 12 episode movie.  The girls were very attractive.  There are several topless and panty scenes to keep the boys aroused.  This movie has no actual porn but there is a lot of horror scenes.
B006Z9K97E|2.0|As the title of my reviewsw suggests I was slightly disappointed by this book. From the description and because of the subject type I had expected to enjoy this more. Maybe because it was written by the author from discussions with the protagonist whose first language is not English perhaps it had some impact on how the book flows

B005LAIGRS|4.0|Safe House(Feb/12)is one of the few movies I have actually gone OUT to see in recent years,and I must say I was very impressed with it.This film ,once it gets started,just never stops;as the action is constant and can even at times take your breath away.The camera stays in fairly tight throughout which also adds to the intensity and immediacy of what you`re seeing.While the DVD`s sound cannot match the dynamics of the theatrical sound system(every shot,punch and bang sounded like a bolt of lightning packed into a millisecond)it still is quite good.<br />The plot involves a CIA safe house in Cape Town,South Africa.It is manned by one person,Matt Weston played by Ryan Reynolds.For almost a year he has been withering away in this stifling post and he has been itching for a transfer....anywhere.Into this relatively boring routine steps one Tobin Frost,played by Denzel Washington.Frost is a former member of the CIA,just like Weston,but who climbed the ladder and became a first class interrogator.Frost has obtained a list made by Israeli intelligence listing all the bad apples in similar organizations around the world.A friend in MI6 has given him the list and he is now on the run from those who wish that list captured and destroyed.In other words Frost is a dead man.He turns himself into the local US embassy and he is in turn moved into Weston`s safe house.<br />It is not long before the safe house itself is under attack and Weston is fleeing across town with his prisoner.Weston is ordered to go to a stadium during a soccer game to retrieve a GPS which will tell Weston the location of the nearest safe house.However during this time Frost manages to escape.Weston reports in that he has lost his prisoner and is also on the run from the local police himself,due to a scuffle at the stadium.Meanwhile Frost has gone to the house of an old friend to have him make him a passport.During this time Weston has an idea on where Frost may be and heads out.The men who attacked the safe house have followed Frost and are now bashing in the door of his friend`s home.His friend lies dead as he flees.Weston has arrived on the scene and helps save Frost and abscond with him to a new safe house.<br />Frost and Weston arrive at the new location and are just settling in when the safe house attendant turns on Weston and he is again in a struggle for his life.Weston barely comes out alive and he makes it back to Frost who he cuffed to a pipe in a room.Weston asks what exactly these people are after and Frost tells him exactly what it entails.Frost then grabs the cuff keys from a semi conscious Weston and escapes.When Weston regains consciousness he is in a bed with his CIA boss from the States beside him,asking what has happened and the whereabouts of Frost.The answer is not long coming as Frost suddenly reappears shooting his way back into the house to get Weston.Frost gets blindsided and shot by Weston`s boss and eventually dies.Weston`s boss is shot in turn by Weston and Weston now has the secret Frost carried.<br />Back at CIA headquarters Weston submits his report to the director who asks about the documents Frost had.Weston feigns innocence,knowing how damaging those secrets are.The film ends as the CIA and agencies of similar ilk around the world,have their top agents arrested for illegal activities.Frost`s original intentions come to fruition thanks to Weston.<br />The film starts out slowly as we are introduced to the two main characters.The moment Frost is driving away with his MI6 contact,who suddenly gets shot while driving,the heat,as they say,is on and the film never stops until the end.One doesn`t know who to trust and the cold,calculating killer and traitor that Frost is first portrayed as,starts to unravel,slowly but surely.And everywhere Frost goes,assassins follow,which is just another on-going mystery on top of many others thrown into the mix.<br />Washington and Reynolds are both outstanding in their roles and play their roles with an intensity that is right on the beam.Washington as Frost is as cold and stoic as his name implies and Reynolds plays the bored CIA agent whose life is suddenly turned topsy turvy and who is soon fighting for his life,wonderfully.Washington also directed this thriller and does a great job at that post also.<br />Technically the film is clear and crisp in it w/s a/r of 2:40:1.Extras include four featurettes and the trailer.<br />All in all a highly recommended piece of film making.As a highly intense drama/thriller they do not get much better than this.It is violent,but it is all justifiable within the film`s context;not violence for violence sake.Buy it today.ntensity that is right on the beam.Washington as Frost is

B005LAIIRQ|4.0|A chilling tale about savagery, death and the belief in the afterlife. Tale focuses on a bunch of oil riggers stranded in snowy Alaska after a plane crash. Only a handful of them survived and they are lacking in the bare necessities while a wolf pack tracks them down, picking them off one by one. The survivors desperately try to get away and seek a safer venue. Liam Neeson is the main star of this film with a somewhat good to good supporting cast. Neeson plays the expert on wolves attempting to give advice to the survivors who are in over their heads and half the time bickering with one another or failing to take the wolf situation seriously enough.<br /><br />Part of the \\"fun\\" is seeing how the \\"oh so clever\\" wolves pick people off. The actions and strategies of the wolves are controversial. Uninformed people act like wolves never attack people out in remote areas but if you do some research you will see the movie isn't always wrong in how it depicts wolf activities. Now, are they are smart as shown in the film? Probably not. Some are arguing the wolves are symbolisms for the Grip Reaper coming to get us but that is another discussion.<br /><br />In the end if you accept the possibility that wolves could attack a group of wounded humans then this is a fun survival tale with a gruesome ending. BTW, it was marketed as an action film in some circles and that is totally dead wrong. They filmed this picture in 40 days and it was based on a short story by Ian MacKenzie.<br /><br />Wolf lovers have boycotted this film arguing wolves never attack people but that's inaccurate and up to major discussions on the forums.<br /><br />STORY/PLOTTING: B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus to B; SURVIVAL SCENES: B to B plus; WOLF PACK DEPICTIONS: B to B (higher if you aren't seeking 100% accuracy); WHEN WATCHED: late June 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|I just love my Kindle for Android! It is convenient to use.  I recommended it to a client while we were discussing our love for books, reading and our awesome Kindles.  Coincidentally, she called later that week to thank me for telling her about the app. She was able to enjoy her books, even though her own Kindle screen accidentally fell apart!
B0087YPCYA|2.0|You know going into a movie like this it won't be Oscar-caliber, but you at least expect a Hollywood production.  This was barely that.  Danielle Panabaker is smoking hot, and an enjoyable actress, but this film is 50,000ft beneath her!  I loved the remake of Friday the 13th, so I figured this sequel would be up to her standards.  Nope.  It was terrible, and like so many Hollywood films these days, it could have been SO MUCH MORE!

B005LAII08|4.0|Yikes, Pixar gets nicked by the double-edged sword. Pixar has had such a wildly successful run of animated films, one wondered how long the streak could be sustained. I guess the uneasy murmurs first surfaced when CARS 2 was critically panned. And now here's BRAVE, and murmur, murmur, murmur. And I liked BRAVE, quite liked it. But we grade on a curve when it comes to Pixar products. And as much as I favor BRAVE, it doesn't hold up to WALL-E or UP or FINDING NEMO or the TOY STORY franchise. Any other animated studio, and odds are I would've cast a more generous eye. But Pixar's standards are so lofty... I rate BRAVE 3.5 out of 5 stars. Kids will adore this movie. The grown-ups should maybe temper expectations.<br /><br />It doesn't flaunt the originality of the Pixar classics. If anything, BRAVE wanders into the more familiar territory of Pixar's corporate partner, Disney. Set in an ancient and more mystical version of Scotland, the story revolves around Merida (Kelly Macdonald), a teenaged princess who rebels against a time-honored custom. Her doting father, King Fergus (Billy Connolly), may've erred in presenting her with a bow and arrows when she was a wee lass. Today Merida is very much a tomboy and has no use for the fineries of her status. When not besieged by her mother's unending instructions on history and proper royal decorum, Merida prefers to roam the craggy landscape and practice her archery. So imagine her collosal pique when her mother informs her that, as per tradition, the time has come for her to choose from three suitors.<br /><br />Maybe Pixar was going for irony when they released BRAVE only a week after Father's Day. The film's central conflict lies between Merida and her exacting mother, Queen Eleanor (Emma Thompson). After a hurtful argument with her mom, Merida flees into the dark woods and stumbles onto a sketchy cottage in the wilds. In the cottage she finds a woodcarving old hag (Julie Walters), except does a woodcarver's home routinely feature a surprisingly mobile broom and a creepy talking bird? Merida is desperate to change her fate. The \\"woodcarver\\" has got something for her.<br /><br />Beware the deal with the devil, the wish granted by the genie of the lamp, and the witch's spell. These never come out right for us foolish mortals. Merida's bargain leaves dreadful repercussions, and it's a bit frustrating that Merida repeatedly refuses to acknowledge any blame. The plot twist, the fallout to Merida's waywardness, is pretty unexpected - unless you knew the film's original title (which I won't mention). But, ugh... I think what follows underscores some folks' big quibble, which is that the film fails somewhat to deliver on the storytelling. As mentioned, this wouldn't be as telling if BRAVE had come out from other studios. But Pixar pictures are celebrated for their cleverness and inventiveness and rich emotional beats. BRAVE, compared to its predecessors (excepting CARS 2), presents a relatively uninspired narrative.<br /><br />I wonder what effect director Brenda Chapman's being replaced had on the film? Because, ultimately, not everything comes together for this film, and this so is unlike Pixar. There are darker, scarier moments in the film which are then offset by a brawny and obvious form of levity. Aside from Merida and Queen Eleanor's depiction, characterization for the cast is doled out in broad strokes. Not to say that I didn't like the cast. King Fergus and the triplet scamps are all endearing as hell, but they're there mostly for comic relief. But if you thought the plot thread with the three hapless suitors is going somewhere, no, it fizzles out. The visiting members of the various clans are stereotyped to the kilt. So brace up for a steady diet of spit takes, brawling, carousing, and mooning (yes, mooning). Billy Connolly, Robbie Coltrane, Kevin McKidd, and Craig Ferguson as the four contentious Scottish lairds are admittedly great fun. Again, I wish they'd been developed more.<br /><br />I know I've bagged on it, but I do recommend BRAVE. The visuals are sublime, and I'm sure it's no coincidence that your eyes are immediately drawn to Merida's fiery, untamed hair. Merida's tresses are so meticulously animated that Rapunzel's hair is gnashing its teeth (to mangle a metaphor). The Scottish Highlands are rendered in grand and panoramic detail. I love the design of the characters, the animators having leaned toward a stylized approach rather than a realistic one. Merida has got this distinctive moon face. It separates her from the other Disney princesses. And then there's Kelly Macdonald's marvelously expressive Scottish brogue. I could listen to her talk all day.<br /><br />Also setting Merida apart is her remarkable aptitude for archery. In recent months, we'd already eyeballed Katniss Everdeen and the Avengers' Hawkeye. Merida's marksmanship rivals that of those two. There's a gratifying scene in which she Robin Hoods her way thru an archery competition, but then gets chewed out by her mum for her trouble. Yeah, Merida sometimes comes across as a brat, but you never doubt that her heart is in the right place. You never doubt that this family loves each other to pieces. Were you concerned that Merida won't be able to reverse the calamitous spell before the second sunrise deadline? Me neither. Ah, but will she own up to her bad behavior? Um...<br /><br />I don't recommend viewing this in the 3D version, by the way. You just can't see anything during the night sequences, and there are heaps of night sequences. Also, you're in for a treat with the captivating animated short LA LUNA, which precedes the feature film. In it, a little boy learns the secret family business, which is awesome.><br />I know I've bagged on it, but I do recommend BRAVE.

B003N5VOUO|5.0|This is a heartfelt movie. Yes, it has being Muslim in America as part of its theme, but at its basic level, it's about being human--finding your humanity in difficult circumstances. The viewpoint of the movie is Rizwan's with flashbacks to his childhood in India, his first encounter with America, his improbable job as a salesman of herbal spa products, and his falling in love. His persistence overcomes his difficulties. The movie emotionally draws you in at the beginning with a mother's love for her son, and its emotional undercurrent of love stays throughout the entire 161 minutes.

B002SSBD6W|4.0|Easily one of the most informative, well-written books about vegetarianism/veganism. Jonathan Safran Foer writes for a more lay audience; he is definitely not a nutritionist, doctor, or food scientist.  However, he is clearly interested and devoted to the topic and wants his message read. I would suggest going through all of his sources upon finishing the book.  Perhaps one of my favorite elements of the books is how incredibly researched and thorough his information is.

B00526ZKYS|5.0|I loved it! Maybe it was the idea of first love and the innocence behind it or the world of delirum and the idea of amor deliria nervosa Or it was the rebeliousness throughout the story that held my attention, but I enjoyed it throughly.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I purchased the first book in the trilogy and somehow managed to get through it. It isn't the best written piece of fiction. Many of the words are repeated and I, like many of the other reviewers am tired of hearing from Ana's \\"inner goddess\\". It also seems that there are way too many sex scenes and emails to/from the Ana and Christian characters and not enough story line in between.That being said,I hate to say it but I've read the second book and am now halfway finished reading the third. So...I've managed to stay hooked...somehow.
B0083GPDBO|5.0|As a sci-fi fan, I enjoy most movies but this one was a real surprise.  The story line was well-thought out.  The character development was the thing that pushed the movie into the five-star range.

B000UR9T8C|1.0|Either they tried too hard, or they didn't try at all.... There are soooo many problems with this movie that they are hard to keep track off....  Let's start w/ some problems that have been carried over from the first two movies.  First of all,  Peter has some type of relationship w/ the every person before they become super-villians.  His friend's dad.  His science mentor.  His friend who thinks Spiderman killed his dad.  His uncle's accidental killer.  His rival at at his job.  Plus, none of these guys are truly evil.  Either they are under the influence of the performance enhancing drug.  Or under influence of the evil microchips in the octopus arms.  Or only doing bad things because his daughter is sick.  Or seeking revenge for his father.  Or because he was humiliated and lost his job.  Then, did you notice that Mary Jane get kidnapped by the villan in EVERY movie!?!?!?! Okay... so after those \\"systematic problems\\", here are my primary problems w/ this film.<br />1.  A meterorite containing an alien life form just happens to land near the only super-powered individual on the planet earth.  Really?<br />2.  The alien hitches a ride on his bike and ends up taking the form of.... wait for it.... clothing.  Ummmm.... Okay.<br />3.  Inconsistencies w/ the Pumpkin Grenades.  Harry ends up w/ slight burns.  Venom gets vaporized.  The Giant Sandman Monster gets half his face blown off.<br />4.  Harry's memory loss is just ridiculous.  There's no other way around it.  Thank goodness he forgets exactly enough to stop trying to kill Peter/ Spiderman.  At least for the next hour or so.<br />5.  Harry's butler knows the truth, but just decided not to tell Harry!  Maybe he wasn't getting paid enough.  There's no legitimate explanation for it!!!!  So when he does tell him, it's basically..... I have seen a lot of crazy Sh** around here.  But your it's father's own fault he's dead.  His own crazy weapons crap killed him.... He didn't even apologize for not telling him right away!!!!<br />6.  The re-writing of the killing of Uncle Ben.  It's bad enough that the Sandman had the best of intentions for commiting crimes in the first place.  He was only trying to save his daughter.  He killed Uncle Ben.  But he didn't mean to.  it was an accident.  My bad.<br />7.  So There are 3 people in NY who want to kill Spiderman.  A city of about 10 million or so people.  2 and a half of them have super powers.  They have to meet up somehow so they can team up and kill spiderman together.  How do they find each other???  They just happen to bump into each other in an alley!!!!!!  WTH!?!?!?  Are you kidding me?  Come on.  There really weren't even trying w/ that one.  Just pathetic...<br /><br />I'm not even getting into the whole evil-goth Peter thing.  Or his bad dancing.  Or the fact that Kristen Dunst sings 2 times in the movie.

B0009X75UG|5.0|I bought this album years ago when it was in cassette tape format; happy to get it in a CD, because I'm not surging ahead into the latest tech gadgets until I have to.  This music is very interesting and stimulating, without making you feel like you had too much coffee.  I suppose some can turn it low and call it background music, but his complexity and variety of instruments makes me just want to listen closely and marvel at his talent.  All of the CD's I have are equally great; but I only have four at present.  Hard to imagine the others being dull or redundant.  If you haven't heard his music yet, I highly recommend it.  And I'd like to know where they found that roaring lion; my cat sat up and took notice when the music began with it!
B006RUJST6|5.0|Colleen Hoover is an amazing writer! She is able to bring you into this book so easily. You feel as if your a fly on the wall to Lake's life and you FEEL EVERYTHING she feels right along with her! I learned so much about life from this book as well and i will be shraing the things ive learned with my daughter as she grows up.<br /><br />AMAZING BOOK!!!!

B0055PMJMW|4.0|I have been a fan of all the Harry Bosch stories for a long time.  It happened that I hadn't read or owned this particular book.  I would hope others would try these stories.  A good read.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The story was good and well written but I didn't like the ending. I was hoping for a dramatic or maybe an unforgettable ending. But it was boring. It's one of those, \\"That's it!?\\" comment. Needs to be like \\"Defending Jacob\\" book ending. Now that's how one should end a book.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I made it through this book without crying, amazingly.  This book is so powerful.  Will explains that slam poetry isn't reliving a painful moment, but sharing a moment you went through with people and the words may touch someone in the audience in the situation that the writer was in at the time.  I'll tell you what, I wasn't in a situation like Lake or Will but this whole book really touched my heart, spoke to me, and taught me so much.<br /><br />I had never heard of slam poetry before this, but I have a feeling I will be you-tubing it for the next 24-48 hours after reading Slammed (straight through no-less!).  It sounds like a powerful source of therapy and the way it is used in this book is incredible! I love the lyrics for the names of each chapter as well.  Colleen Hoover really knows how to get a powerful story and message out there.  I just can't quit saying POWERFUL!!<br /><br />The circumstances that bring Lake and Will together are less than desirable, but through everything it bonds them and they both learn so much about their lives.<br /><br />There are no words that do this book justice - all readers MUST buy this book.  I can promise it will shake you to your core.  Colleen, you made one hell of a debut and I look forward to reading the rest of your books.<br /><br />This is by far the best book I have ever read.  Thank you for sharing your talent for writing with all of us.
1451683405|4.0|This was a very quick and easy read. Not much is explained as far as terminology, but it is well put together in a simple manner. This is the first book I have read by Harris and though I may agree with Dennett more than with him, he presents a lot of very valuable insight into neurological processes and the behind the scenes of decision making. I will suggest this book to everyone as it is short (it took me about an hour to read) and written in simple language. It will cause you to rethink your notions of free will.
030758836X|4.0|I thought this was an interesting story about two people who are both crazy as loons!  I took this to the beach and enjoyed the plot twists and turns.  This is a book that you will enjoy because it is fast and furious.  One twist becomes clear, and another pops up.

B007I2BZIE|4.0|I'd recommend that those wistful of Rush's days of yore - get the thought of Rush moving backward in time out of your mind.  They're moving ahead and charting new territory.  Yes, there appears to be somewhat of an homage paid to their past in Clockwork Angels, from a few By-Tor'esque and Bastille Day riffs present in \\"Headlong Flight\\" to some Signals and Hold Your Fire similarities in \\"The Anarchist\\" and \\"The Wreckers\\" (which is an absolute stand-out and destined to become a classic in the Rush cannon) - but make no mistake, this trio delivers impressive vitality and freshness in this effort.<br /><br />I have no expectations of new Rush efforts, mainly because over the past 15 years they have produced albums that contain several solid songs invariably and the remainder are not typically memorable.  Clockwork Angels is different.  While I really enjoyed Snakes and Arrows, it wasn't as cohesive and memorable as Clockwork Angels.  This is an album that after just a few listens gets stuck in your head.

B003EYVXXW|5.0|The movie Agora centres around of the great figures in the history- the female philosopher Hypatia of Alexandria.<br />The events of the movie take place from the years 391-415 CE, and show the rise of Christianity and the fall of the old religion of the Classical World, as well as the fall of science and reason.<br /><br />Hypatia (Rachel Weisz) is a philosopher teaching science to both pagan and Christian students. She is particularly focused on one perplexing issue- the problems with Ptolemy's geocentric model of the solar system. One of her students, the future prefect Orestes (Oscar Isaac), proclaims his love for Hypatia but to his dismay she rejects him (which has much to do with the fact that her Classical Greek upbringing means she will lose her freedom if she gets married). Another who loves Hypatia is one of her family's slaves, Davus (Max Minghella), who converts to Christianity very early in the film.<br /><br />Tension rises on the streets of Alexandria as Christians constantly provoke the pagans, eventually leading to the pagans starting a massive riot in the city, in an attempt to rid it of the offending Christians. The Christians, however, are too numerous to get rid of, and the pagans must barricade themselves within the Alexandria Serapeum. Rome's Christian emperor Theodosius sends a message to Alexandria that he will pardon the pagans, on the condition that they allow the Christians to enter the Serapeum and destroy its contents. This leads to the infamous destruction of the Serapeum's vast amounts of scientific and historical knowledge and to the banning of all pagan religious practices.<br /><br />Years later, things only get worse as the monk-turned-bishop Cyril (Sami Samir) extends discrimination to not only pagans, but to Jews as well. When the murder of a group of Jews in a theatre goes unpunished by the Christian authorities, a group of Jews take the law into their own hands by killing some Christians. In retaliation, Christian mobs slaughter Jews in the streets, and the authorities do nothing to stop this.<br /><br />As well as showing the increasing intolerance created by religious fundamentalist attitudes, another important part of the plot is Hypatia coming closer and closer to solving the riddles of planetary orbits, going from rejecting Ptolemy's geocentric model in favour of Aristarchus' heliocentric one, to eventually figuring out that orbits are not perfect circles. Her support of heliocentrism (considered blasphemous to the Church at the time) and her refusal to convert to Christianity brand her a heathen and a \\"witch\\", and her influence on the prefect Orestes brand her a threat, eventually leading to her death.<br /><br />Overall, this was an excellently done movie. It was good to see a film that wasn't afraid to show historical Christian bigotry (as opposed to the usual portrayals of Christians holding some sort of moral high ground). Many Christians were apparently offended by the movie, but the fact of the matter is that Christian history is indeed very violent, and in any case the movie was criticising fundamentalism in general rather than any specific faith.<br />The characters are for the most part real historical figures, with some exceptions. The character of Davus is not a historical figure, but the way the movie is done makes this character fit into the plot quite well.<br />The film does take some liberties with historical accuracy. For instance, there is no evidence that Hypatia ever dabbled in helicentrism, let alone figured out that orbits were not perfect circles. However, seeing as very little remains of Hypatia's work, we can't rule out the possibility that she may well have made these discoveries but just never managed to publicise them. Also, Hypatia's death at the end of the film is portrayed as occurring by far less gruesome means than official accounts state (I won't give away the exact manner of her death in the film though, as I don't wish to spoil the ending for those who haven't seen the film).<br /><br />Agora is a film I would recommend to anyone with an interest in history, especially the history of religion and the history of science.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book garnered more discussion in our group than any for a long time. So many angles, twists and turns, automatons, subplots, real or imagined, etc. A bit daunting to keep track at times but well worth the effort.
B00881VLCE|3.0|Unfortunately, it started getting too glitchy to use. The puzzle pieces would not rotate, but \\"jumped\\" everytime I tapped them.

B008CP93S0|1.0|Rudd has no leading man qualities. Few actors can make you long for the talents of Ben Stiller, but Rudd is one of them. As a second lead, great. (40 yr old virgin, for example) But as a lead? no way. Aniston plays a post-collegiate 20-something who is trying to find herself. Of course, Aniston is 40+. And that's only the start of the \\"R U Kidding Me\\" stupidity of Wanderlust. This movie will be remembered as one of the increasingly annoying films from the shallow talent pool of Judd Aptow's stable of boy-men. A talent-less snooze fest.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I heard about Wool from an old friend on Twitter. Being an avid scifi reader, I picked it up on his recommendation and was not disappointed. Though not focused on (or even featured, really) the science fiction element is present, just off-stage. Wool is about people, and is written in a compelling, page-turning way that makes it very hard to put down. This book is quintessentially why we need self-publishing. The slush-pile reader that threw this book out should feel like the Fox execs that canceled Firefly: that they made a horrible, awful mistake. 1000+ 5-star reviews are not wrong, you need to read this book.
0345803485|1.0|So, I wanted to see what the hype was about and decided to buy this as a summer read. I knew that it was not going to be \\"classic literature\\" hence the decision to read it while on the sand. Horrible is the best adjective I can come up with to describe the writing. It seriously seems like it was written by a teenager whose idea of romance was founded on reading \\"Sweet Valley High\\" books and whose idea of erotica was formed by watching Premium Cable channels on a Friday night.<br /><br />The storyline is so implausible that it should be filed under \\"fantasy.\\" I'm enjoy a good romance with a little erotica mixed in but this book makes me cringe, literally! You would be better off spending your money on a Harlequin novel. I can not even bring myself to finish the novel because I keep making faces and rolling my eyes (just like the lead character; where's my spanking?) while reading it and my husband keeps laughing at my expressions.<br /><br />I could go on and on but I've already spent more time reading and reviewing this piece of rubbish than I had anticipated.<br /><br />SAVE YOUR MONEY! Buy a cheap romance novel and a Kama Sutra \\"how-to\\" book instead ;o)
0345803485|5.0|I wasn't expecting to like this series, but i found it a good pool/beach book.  The storyline was interesting from the beginning and it made me want to keep reading the series.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|A very poor attempt at ripping off Anne Rice's Sleeping Beauty trilogy while taking a shot at morphing Dorian Grey with the comical, appears-to-have-been-written-by-a-teenager Twilight crap. Absolutely horribly written and a very weak story. Doesn't deserve even one star but couldn't leave a review without it. Run away!!
0345529057|2.0|This series was reputed to be \\"a modern day Tolkein\\". Not hardly. It meanders through various characters without any real direction or plot. Yes.... Everyone knows it is about scheming middle age fictional power struggles. Yes we know there are characters that remain to be played out. But.... It goes on forever and rarely seems to bring the  individual  stories together in any interesting pattern.<br /><br />Disappointed........absolutely.. I have invested a lot of time in the first 4 books waiting and hoping for some actual events to bring the story to some more active level , or some grand conclusion. Alas...not to be. I do not intend to waste any more time with the fifth or even sixth books to go through Mr.Martin's' montage of individual stories. Actually it was not even an intriguing read. Not worth the time, effort, or the money to read this series. This may actually be a story where the movie/HBO series is much better than the books. It could not be much more disappointing . Sorry Mr.Martin.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is an interesting game. I spend a lot of time playing it is very addicting. I play it whenever I get bored.
0345803485|5.0|I got a little tired of all the details, but overall was a good story.  Had to read another book in between this and Fifty Shades of Darker.  Can't wait to read the next book, however.
0345803507|4.0|The last book of this crazy series takes a lot of unexpected twists and turns.  Not as hot and racy as the other two books but still just as nuts.  Ending was a little bit of a let down after the crazy train ride Ana and Fifty take but still awesome.  Really hope another book comes out at some point!

B005LAIHYU|4.0|\\"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter\\" boldly reimagines the Civil War President as an action hero.  The movie cleverly intermingles Lincoln's real life as rail-splitter, storekeeper, lawyer, politician, and president with a secret life as a hunter of the vampires who murdered his mother.<br /><br />The story opens with a plot-setting scene in which the young Abraham interferes with a particularly villanous slave trader.  The murder of his mother leads Abraham to seek revenge, only to discover the slave trader is much more of a monster than he had imagined.  Lincoln survives the encounter and is taken under the wing of a mysterious stranger, who trains him in the art of killing vampires.<br /><br />Lincoln's hatred of vampires follows him deep into the Civil War.  The crisis of the Battle of Gettysburg prompts the President and a small circle of friends to mount a special operation to win the battle and defeat the vampires, who, naturally, are Confederate slaveholders...<br /><br />\\"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter\\" features some gorgeous special effects, which in turn enable some mind-blowing martial arts action, along with a truly spectacular concluding dramatic sequence aboard a train.  The movie plays its exotic premise straight up, while actor Benjamin Walker is quite good as Lincoln; recommended as good entertainment, especially in the 3D version.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|so glad they brought this app to the kindle fire. one of the beet way to get your news or read any posts from your social networking sites. kinda wonder if landscape would look good on this.

B007R3AZNK|5.0|I have been a fan of Joe's for many years and have seen him in concert many times. But, never heard him like this. Whole new dimension of tones. His voice has also matured. Every song on this album grabs me in a special way. And for dessert the last song on the album is delicious. His guest singer Jimmy is an amazing blues singer. Enjoy.

B00650SSDU|4.0|Dylan (Justin Timberlake) is an up and coming art editor and Jamie (Mila Kunis) is the headhunter who has been hired to try to entice him to a new job with GQ.  She's good at her job so he quickly leaves L.A. for the new job in New York City.  After becoming friends, Dylan and Jamie make a deal . . . to have no-strings attached sex while remaining friends.  What could possible go wrong with that set-up?<br /><br />The ending is so predictable, I could have written it myself, but this charming little rom-com is still worth watching.  Timberlake and Kunis have a nice chemistry . . . and both have nice bodies to admire during the not-infrequent sex scenes.  Despite following a pretty well-worn plot, the writing was good and there were plenty of laughs.<br /><br />A pleasant way to pass a couple of hours and if you're looking for a fun little comedy, you could do way worse than this one.
B0000TB014|5.0|Loved this DVD, saw videos of songs I didn't know were out there.<br /><br />He is the greatest. My ultimate favorite is \\"EARTH SONG\\"

B003O86FMW|4.0|I couldnt put it down.Lots of action and the charaters draw you in.I got all three books.This is the second and didnt let me down.It is very well written and you almost believe its non fiction
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|As some other reviewers have noted, it's really obvious that there was no professional writer involved in the creation of this book.  It's fragmented and sometimes frankly the writing is childlike and hard to follow. It's unsurprising that the writing is not always fluid -- considering the author's circumstances.  Nevertheless the voice is hers distinctly throughout this book, and that's admirable.<br /><br />I admire Jaycee because she brings two very important things to light - one, childhood sexual abuse is awful, and terrible, and inconceivable and yet - it happens.  Though the details of her abuse are difficult to read they are at the same time very eye opening.  I feel that if Jaycee is able to discuss this information publicly, it could potentially give others with the same types of painful events in their past a voice.  It's incredibly difficult to read for obvious reasons, but it also forces an acknowledgement on the part of the reader, and I think that's really important.<br /><br />Two - Jaycee is incredibly forgiving.  It gives me hope that I can forgive the small transgressions others have done me in my life and that they can forgive those I've done them, since Jaycee's obviously moving towards forgiving some major ones...the kinds of things that I cannot even conceive of forgiving...since she recognizes that not to do so would consume her inside.  This is a very mature realization and one which I presume has been brought on by years of reflection on the terrible wrongs done to her both as a child and as an adult.  All in all, this is an inspiring, bizarre, and difficult book which is basically unlike anything I've ever read before.  I certainly wish both Jaycee and her family the best - she is clearly a light in this world in spite of all that has happened to her, and that's wonderful.
B0086700CM|5.0|I really love the game on my other devices, but on my kindle fire it keeps telling me to add a credit card. I think it's because you can make in game purchases, but it never asked for that on any other games where you can do that. Kinds made me sad... but it's still a great game.

Every album had at least a few gems and your guitar work has always(!) been stellar. I don't care what they say about your appearances at NAMM, so what if you had a couple beers first, big deal. Some people are big babies, complain, complain.<br /><br />Who knows how many people would never have even picked up a guitar if it weren't for you?<br />Valerie was right: you have a HUGE heart. That didn't go unnoticed and it won't be quickly forgotten by those of us who noticed.<br /><br />The one sobering (elbow, elbow) thought in this may be simply this: you waited too long to<br />get it together and do this. Ten years ago would have been a lot better. After the industry gets done cannibalizing the music of the previous decade to 'produce' the work of the next...

0345803507|5.0|This series is a wonderful story, tied up with some unusual situations. Once I started the first book, I was glad I had purchaed all three, because I couldn't put them down. A very very good read!!
0099579936|1.0|Who, what, why and how is this a New York Times Bestseller? I am so confused. This was quite possibly one of the worst books I have ever read. Besides the redundancy, and limited vocabulary of E.L. James, what really makes me upset is this book had the potential to be REALLY good.<br /><br />Unfortunately, for the readers, this book falls painstakingly short. I found myself trying to change the story line in my head to enjoy the book. For example, this book is obviously for a mature audience, however Christian, the dominant, is 27 flipping years old. I don't know how other readers felt about his age, but for me it was a serious problem. I would have liked him to be in his late 30's or early 40's. Perhaps I'm just stuck on Nine 1/2 Weeks.<br /><br />Christian is gorgeous, has an amazing body, wears pants that fit \\"perfectly on his hips\\", is incredibly intelligent and to top it off he is a billionaire (at 27 may I remind you), who apparently spends all of his time and energy stalking Ana. He shows up at the drop of the hat, answers her emails within five minutes....all while running his billion dollar company. What an amazing multi-tasker!<br /><br />Besides Christian being young, and red headed, the other problem I had was the repetitive vocabulary used throughout the book. Page after page I kept telling myself this has to get better. It. Did. Not. Ana and Christian seem to only know how to \\"whisper\\" and \\"murmur\\" to each other, and when Ana's not whispering or murmuring with Christian, she is playing tug of war with her subconscious and high-fiving her \\"inner goddess\\".  Honestly, I just wanted them both to shut the hell up.<br /><br />Ana (or should I say E.L. James) describes every character in the book as having \\"dark expressions\\" and apparently everyone likes to \\"frown\\" a lot. When Ana's lips aren't busy frowning, she's biting them and continues to bite them on every page. Christian's favorite pass time appears to be pulling on Ana's chin, smelling her hair, kissing her \\"deeply\\" with tongue, making her orgasm, and constantly making her \\"flush\\". I am almost positive and would be willing to bet money that Ana \\"flushes\\" at least once on each page.<br /><br />I really have no idea how this author has gotten away with grossly overusing boring and repetitive words throughout her book, and it makes me wonder if this book was ever truly proofread.<br /><br />This book could have been really good, but it is both horribly written and irritatingly repetitive. The only part of the book that was semi-interesting were the emails back and forth between Christian and Ana....some of those were pretty funny.<br /><br />Would I recommend this book? No. I would not. I bought this book after hearing so many women talking about it. I usually read the reviews on Amazon first. I sure wish I did that. I'm not sure what the hype is all about, and now I'm left wondering if any of these rave reviewers have ever taken any type of literature class.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I had never played this game until my friend shared it with me. I easily downloaded and began playing. I love the ease and the challenge. It can be a great mindless game to pass the time or help you fall asleep or you can play for the challenge.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|This books does begin a bit slow, but keep going.  About 1/3 of the way thru it really picks up and by the end, you really do want more.  Which is a good thing the 2nd book is coming out soon.  What kept me going is the the interaction of the main characters, Diana Bishop and Matthew Clairmont.  This book takes a fantasy concept, and makes you believe this really could all be true.  That witches, vampires and demons exist in our world because of scientific evidence.  I can't wait for book two.

I also bought the digital Deluxe version, have to have it everywhere:) 1st track \\"Trespassing\\" (title track) grabs you instantly with great bass & hand clapping, along with superb vocals, I was singing along & clapping in sync in no time. 2nd track \\"Cuckoo\\", a dancy, shake your booty, fun time song! Drive around, Roll your windows down & crank this summer anthem up. 3rd track is \\"Shady\\" with Nile Rodgers & Sam Sparro, love the beat & couldn't stop dancing, very soulful, It did make me feel a little Shady. 4th track \\"Never Close Our Eyes\\" (newest single) written by Bruno Mars, it shows, very catchy! 5th track \\"Kickin In\\" to be honest this one had to grow on me and it did, has a very Michael Jackson vibe, Loving it. 6th track \\"Naked Love\\", don't be fooled by the title, I believe it's more about being yourself without all the \\"accessories\\" great club song. 7th track \\"Pop That Lock\\" one of my favorites, sick beat, hope you like to dance, I know all the words already. 8th track \\"Better Than I Know Myself\\" (first single) very cool song, highlights Adams vocals. 9th track \\"Broken English\\", very new wave sound, draws you in after a few listens & boom you are hooked! 10th track \\"Underneath\\" get your tissues ready, this one brought me to tears, I can picture walking through someone's life and seeing what's inside, hauntingly beautiful. 11th track \\"Chokehold\\", has a rock vibe, makes you want to sing along & rock your shoulder back every time he sings (Bring it on back)well at least I do! very edgy song.  12th & final track on standard version \\"Outlaws of Love\\", super strong vocals, this song has a deep meaning, listen to the words carefully.  Now for the bonus tracks and they truly are a bonus... 1st \\"Runnin\\", I can't get enough, Adam uses his lower register & WOW sounds incredible, didn't know he could go that low, will pull you in & you will push repeat....yeah it's that good. The range Adam covers in Runnin will blow your mind!  Next \\"Take Back\\", not my favorite at first listen, play it a couple of times & I dare you to not sing my favorite lyric: We used to be a jungle sticky & wild, used to be we owned the night!  Last bonus track \\"Nirvana\\" after listening to it I want to go to Nirvana, sounds sexy & mystic, I am a dreamer so I would fit right in! There are no mediocre songs, you will not regret buying it, Rolling Stone does not give an Album 4 stars unless it is truly deserved and I must say this Album certainly does not disappoint! Buy the Deluxe version (well worth it for the 3 bonus tracks) give it a thorough listen, with an open mind, you will fall in love with it!
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|At least the professional critics should be banished to the \\"U\\" planet.<br />John Carter was a nice surprise for the amateur critic like myself.<br />It had a bit of Star Wars, Avatar, H.G. Wells Time Machine, Superman and Forbidden Planet all neatly packaged in an adrenaline packed love story.<br />Another great flick for the boys and girls night out - not too much estrogen, and not too much testosterone.<br />Great special effects.<br />Good Job Walt!
B0086700CM|5.0|every game gets boring after a while if you play it constantly! its a good game and its fast paced
B008ASLQZW|1.0|Did Nick want to bail on this movie franchise?  Probably.<br />It was evident by the lack of acting, and the lack of something as simple as a story.<br />Hey, let's get together and make a sequel - who needs writers or good acting.<br />Recommendation: Don't even wait for it to come out on television, because it probably won't even make it to the half-dollar video bin at the local carwash.<br />The DVD for this movie would be useful for replacing clay pigeons at the local shotgun range.<br />DON'T BOTHER - This movie doesn't deserve a fraction of the one star that I gave it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I got a new kindle and downloaded one of my favorite games solitaire. it's easy to use and a great way to pass the time while waiting for car repairs/ planes/appointments etc.
B002MG2RG0|4.0|I've always enjoyed this movie, however, in my opinion, Bela Lugosi's portryal of Igor in \\"The son of Frankenstein\\" was his best performance. He stole the movie from both Boris Karloff and Basil Rathbone. That said he did give a good performance as Count Dracula. The movie moves a bit slow and it has a lot of qualities of a theatere performance. All in all i would recomment this DVD. John R. Tracy
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its kinda cool how you can see and play over 100 games. And if you can aford to buy  games you can complete tasks to earn points and buy games.
0307951529|3.0|\\"This was recommended to me by Michael Hanna, a former media colleague who now owns and runs The Mattress Lot in Portland. His story opens the book.<br /><br />The $100 Startup is a very interesting and eye-opening read: many of the people featured just got going with something rather than giving it a great deal of advanced study.<br /><br />The book would have benefited by going deeper into each story -- I wanted more about exactly HOW some of them got started, what obstacles they met along the way, and how they overcome those obstacles. In particular, I was intrigued by the story of Naomi Dunford, who apparently launched an online empire from nothing (Ittybiz) by offering to brainstorm with people for $250 a pop. Apparently people were willing to hire her for this right away... how did THAT happen?<br /><br />The author also undoubtedly encountered some people who tried to launch a \\"$100 startup\\", failed, and wound up concluding that this life was not for them. Those cautionary tales would have offered some good lessons to anyone considering the approach the book recommends.<br /><br />In fairness, much of that information may be contained in the materials the author sells on his website. The $100 Startup gives a valuable introduction to the idea of starting a business on a shoestring, and planted at least one idea-to-be-seriously-explored in this reader's head.
B007P3TMW2|5.0|People seem to either really understand the movie and appreciate it for what it is or they just don't get it and therefore don't like it. The movie isn't about your average kid dealing with the loss of a parent (that alone being horribly challenging). It's about a boy with a form of austism (I believe) who is trying to cope not only without having his Dad anymore but is also trying to cope with 9/11 and how his Dad died. Oscar has to process his intense anger and sadness in his own unique way and that is what the movie is all about...<br /><br />Be warned though, it's a very, very emotional and \\"heavy\\" movie (especially if you have a family member or friend who deals with similar mental health/development challenges). Probably not a movie that would be good or entertaining for anyone under 13 or `14.<br /><br />The performances by the young boy who portrays Oscar is phenomenal, and of course Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock are extremely talented and incredibly gifted...
B007CIQ4B2|5.0|I believe Ben Howard will go down as my favorite artist of 2012.  I know were only half way through the year, but this guy is amazing.  Awesome voice, guitar playing, melodies, lyrics, backup singers and too much to list.  Music for the soul!  I have purchased tickets to see him in Boulder and then I will be seeing him right after that in Austin at ACL fest.  Can't wait!  BUY IT NOW!
B00846WWVM|5.0|Sprinkle is a very fun and challenging game. The levels are endless. If you want a challenging and fun and endless game sprinkle is for you.
0823015033|5.0|I loooove this book!!!! I've read it three times before starting anything! It is so well written and it explains step by step how to create a unique art doll that is personalize without loosing all the technical side. It really did help me to create my very first doll slowly. I now understand better how to use different polymer clays (Fimo, Super Sculpey or  Cernit) to name a few. Not only that I understand how important it is to have all the fundamental tools to manipulate the clay but also with acrylic painting too.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game...it is a great game to have when you are looking to pass bu the tyke and have fun. Everyone that I know also loves this game...it is definetly a good choice
B007SYWFRM|5.0|all the fun characters from the films in a cute game.  hours of entertainment for the kids.  highly recommend this entertaining game.
B001W6S0C6|5.0|While Christopher Nolan is raking in the dough for his \\"Dark Knight\\" franchise (and rightly so), Tim Burton's original 1989 \\"Batman\\" movie is really the film that first legitimized the character as a viable on screen superhero. For anyone who was alive when the film came out, Bat-mania was everywhere that summer. You couldn't go anywhere without seeing that yellow bat symbol, whether it'd be on billboards, posters, and of course T-shirts.<br /><br />To honor the memory of this beloved film, Warner Brothers has released this 20th Anniversary blu-ray book edition. This edition gives us a great print of the film, along with hours of great special features documenting the making of the film as well as Batman fandom. These features are exactly the same on every blu-ray release, but this edition comes with an excellent behind-the-scenes book attached to the blu-ray case, and also includes an excerpt from a comic adaptations of the film, which is quite excellent.<br /><br />For fans of the film, this is THE blu-ray edition to have.
B007L6VR12|5.0|This is the Ideal Perfect Summer Movie<br /><br />The miracle of this movie is that it not only offers a glimpse/reminder of what it was like to be young without idealizing youth (aren't all young people unsatisfied customers) but it also offers a glimpse of what it feels like being old (still an unsatisfied customer). And yet Wes Anderson films suggest (and this one better than any of the others) that we can find comraderie/community and, yes, even love, by simply sharing our dissatisfactions with another.<br /><br />The island community puts on a play every year about Noah's flood, and in Wes Anderson's version of this Bible story the only way to survive the rising tide of youthful/adult dissatisfaction is in twos.<br /><br />Moonrise Kingdom has the power of an allegorical fable and the sheer visual delight of a toy store/amusement park fantasyland. No other director is as good at conveying what ails us as humans and yet presenting it in a way that makes us ok with our imperfect status.<br /><br />An immediate all-time favorite.
0547569653|3.0|Great book as it relates to story telling, however I bought the book anticipating more detail on being a vegan athlete. This book is not that, there are some recipies...but that's the extent of it. This book is more inspirational reading than anything else. If I had known this, I would have waited and not paid 25 bucks for it.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|Michael Connelly never ceases to fail in all of his great novels. Have read many of his books, another great piece of ork Morton Trier
B0086700CM|5.0|I'm reading lots of reviews that purchase is required to advance. its not at all!  you can buy extra coins but you don't HAVE to.  Its fun till you upgrade everything and unlock all the characters then it does get a bit boring. but it still is fun every once and awhile
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Though I was intrigued by the nature of the subject matter, did finish the first book, it is not a subject matter that I would care to continue with
0345803485|5.0|Once you start reading, you won't put it down!  I ordered the next two books of the trilogy before I was half way through this one.
B0086700CM|5.0|this app is great! i always find my sekf on it, playing all the time. its very time consuming, but in a good way! love it!
B00000K3D4|4.0|This is an enjoyable fantasy, with an over-the-top performance by David Bowie as the Goblin King and a charming youthful heroine played by Jennifer Connelly complementing the imaginative puppeteering of Jim Henson. There's lots of humor, a few scary moments, but generally nothing to cause parents too much anxiety.<br /><br />The genius of Henson has always been to take a medium which is essentially for children and give it enough wit and subtlety to keep adults entertained. Those who look down on this movie as beneath their level of sophistication (you can find a few of them in the lower-starred reviews) have missed the point. This isn't a film with a message or an allegory of life's lessons, it's entertainment.<br /><br />Relax, laugh, admire the creativity of the inimitable Jim Henson and enjoy. It's as simple as that.
B007ORVC36|1.0|This Mad Men episode was terrible. It was shaky and every 3 minutes it stopped gave me a headache to watch and couldnt even finish it. I did get a credit for it but didnt want to try it again.
B004FRX0MY|3.0|It is finally there for IPhone. I love it. I have bought 10 mp3 albums already. It is a win win for both amazon and apple.<br />My complaint:<br />1. Some Chinese title songs had random code for artist or title name when uploaded . Cloud drive also distinguish between lower and upper case letters! Fix these!<br />2. Please accept apple lossless format somehow! I know there might be some legal issue, but one way is to convert it to amazon format when upload, with user confirmation of course.<br /><br />Looking forward to more use of cloud drive and cloud player!!!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This book ws nothing short of fantasric. Ryan is able to make you feel for these characters in such a great way and the story is amazing.
030758836X|5.0|Think you've given up reading anything longer than a magazine article?  No time?  No interest in the longer form anymore?  Attention span has evaporated?  If you read only one novel this year, make it \\"Gone Girl,\\" by Gillian Flynn.  As much a commentary on marriage as it is a thriller, this story is hugely compelling, superbly crafted and twisty right up to the end.  You will ditch your chores, cancel appointments and stay up all night to finish it. You're welcome.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book is very thought provoking and enlightening on a lifestyle most people do not know about and will never experience.  The author really knows how to draw you in and I found myself really pulling for the relationship to work.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love AccuWeather. I can check current conditions, forecast, &amp; local radar to see whether a storm is approaching, all at the touch of a button.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|very good game extremely addicted play all day.easy to learn and understand with fun scenarios would definately recomend for everyone
B00785P2QC|3.0|Much like farmville and others like it. They want you to spend money but you don't have to. It's fine but nothing spectacular.
B0086700CM|5.0|honestly I have to say I love this app, it gives me something to do when I'm bored and its also kinda addicting
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Killer app.  Tons of options!  Easy to use interface.  Well worth the money!  Get it NOW or be lame.  -Maximilian  [...]
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|it has been many years since I have played Oregon Trails! This game is different but in a good way, love it!
B005JE7WKI|5.0|Like any horror,science fiction, or even most action movies if you pick apart the basic premise of the movie you won't enjoy it and you should probably spend your time reading technical journals. If you love movies for the escape from everyday problems and for pure enjoyment don't miss this one. Watch it once and you'll think it's pretty darn funny. Watch it again and pick up the subtleties you missed the first time and I'm betting you'll think this is one of the funniest movies you've ever seen. There's rarely a wasted line throughout and the characters are unforgetable.<br />My wife doesn't particularly care for the sillier of the horror (usually zombie) movies that I watch but she literally had tears in her eyes from laughing and has pretty much insisted we watch it every time anyone who has never seen it comes over.<br />Tucker and Dale is a gem!!
B004IYWN7C|5.0|I ordered this movie for my grandchildren and they loved it. I am thinking about purchasing this movie to have in my home collection.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I really like this game because it makes you think and its creative in a way. Its also fun and entertaining, I love this game
B007D2XSW0|5.0|this is an easy little program to use. it is worth the money. I would get this if I were you.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a good way to pass the time during school hours and any other place that is public like in a train :D
B006GKHE6G|1.0|it takes up more then half of my application space and I cant delete most of my apps for this one
0345803485|5.0|The writing is not the best, however the storyline is interesting and keeps you wanting to read further and find out what will happen next. The sex scenes get a bit old after a while, but the intensity of the characters, the story and the descriptions make you wanting more. I read all 3 books in one week and have started re-reading them again. Excellent books, hope she writes a 4th book and books from Christian's perspective! Am looking forward to the movie...hope it does not disappoint.
B0086700CM|5.0|it is a cool game loved it every since it was on my ipod I am so addicted to this<br /><br />  LOVE IT!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I use this to control my PC from my android phone while on the couch. It works great, and keeps me productive.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|This is one step up from Instagram, in my opinion as it allows hi def pictures. I have both and find myself using PicShop a lot more.
B0086700CM|5.0|You have to play this game it's amazingly addicting. Plus on top of that it's FREE!!!!!!!! Free is usually horibble but this time its really fun.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Great read! This was my first book from Amazon and it is sure to be a classic in collection I'll soon have! Thx Amz.
0763644765|5.0|We're doing EC (elimination communication) with our 5mo, and have recently started transitioning him from being held over the toilet to sitting on his own on the potty. This book has been keeping him entertained while he's getting used to the idea. Even though we're pretty sure he's nowhere near being able to follow the plot, he loves the pictures (the surprised baby especially makes him giggle). Alas, sometimes he just wants to chew the cover, and the book isn't waterproof enough to withstand that well.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- great story (for a toilet book ;)<br />- beautiful drawings<br />- plenty of pages (long enough to work as relaxing distraction)<br />- comfortable to hold even for an infant<br />- plenty of emotions on baby's face - great for teaching feelings as well<br /><br />Cons:<br />- easily damaged by water/saliva (but not really designed with orally-obsessed 5mos in mind, so that's understandable)
B005KR6OBM|2.0|Received the DVDs on time and they all work. BUT, I received two season 2 sets and no season 3! Really disappointing because when I figured it out I was wanting to start season 3 and had friends over!
B0018QQQK8|3.0|Typical Sparks tome, and that's fine. You don't read him for ground breaking story telling. Like McDonalds french fries, it's a comfort knowing what you're going to get. Generally a female product, I will occationally pick one up for a mindless fast read. Not everything needs to be War and Peace. Overall a quick predidctable story that will fill a few hours.
1419702238|5.0|My daughter read this book in a one afternoon on the couch, she has collected all editions. This book is the most lively and best in the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series.
B0086700CM|4.0|Starts out hard but becomes very addictive. It is difficult to hold a tablet and make the needed swipes on the screen otherwise I would have given 5 stars.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|Intense. Engaging. Entertaining. Visually astonishing with fantastic special effects. Intense. Awesome music/perfect soundtrack. Capturing. Excellent ending. Intense. One of the top 5 movies of 2011 period
031606792X|4.0|This is by far my favorite book of the four in the series.<br /><br />I continued to think Bella is an idiot (Sure.. I'll let this half human/half vampire baby kill me... they'll save me anyway with vampire venom, right? Even though just the other day I was thinking I wanted to stay human for a few more years and go to college and maybe even consider being sort of less co-dependent even though I am now married to a vampire.. being a vampire two seconds after I married one could work too... I'll figure out all the details about how to tell Charlie & Renee later...).<br /><br />One thing I DID like was the second part of the book told from Jacob's pov.  His chapter titles were hilarious... and I enjoyed hearing the story from him more than I enjoyed hearing it from Bella.<br /><br />I liked the amount of detail in this book.  I also really liked the suspense and conflict presented in the book.  This book was worth the 700+ pages that it took to finish. Overall, a great wrap up to the series.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I just wrote a review for this but realized I posted under my husbands account..so here it is on mine.<br /><br />Wow! Is all I can say. I started reading this around 11 am this morning because my 4 kids are out of town and I had a quiet house. I just put it down and finished it 8 hours later..I didn't eat, drink or even pee!<br /><br />I love watching the ID channel and every show on there as well as all the crime dramas on t.v. Every crime show and drama and real life news rolled into one. This had everything...very current references, my mind was picking up on subtle clues and trying to figure out did he? would he? I love that it is told thru each character also..kept me guessing!<br /><br />I was hooked...so many twists and the character development was great....A MUST read. I need to find some more of the author's works and get to reading!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a pretty basic app but it is a good one.  I have never had it quit on me like a lot of other ones have.<br />There are several different options like the design of the card deck and how you want the game scored.  It also keeps track of your win/lose statistics.
0385534639|5.0|I cannot say enough about this book. The words are lovely to read, which makes the whole book more enjoyable. It speaks to Morgensterns skill as an author. The characters are complicated and magical, each in their own way. There are so many small details to enchant readers. The constant time switch didn't bother me, it just made me want to read on. I would recommend this book to any fiction lover.
B005ZUR724|5.0|Pretty fun game so far. Just like WoW... surprised Blizzard doesn't go after them.  Very well done especially for a handheld game.
B0086700CM|5.0|i have been waiting for this app for a long time but it is worth the wait! now im sooo addited...
0143120530|4.0|This book will not learn you how to get a better memory. You will get some explanation but not enough.<br />This book will show you how a \\"normal\\" goal focused person can be USA Memory champion.<br /><br />You will also learn about Memory experts in the world.<br /><br />I like this book but not 5 stars because the title make you think you will learn how to improve your memory.<br />One book that will do that is : \\"The Memory Book: The Classic Guide to Improving Your Memory at Work, at School, and at Play of Harry Loraynehttp://www.amazon.com/Harry-Lorayne/e/B001H9Q098/ref=ntt_athr_dp_pel_1 \\"
B007I2BZIE|1.0|The only decent songs are The Wreckers, Headlong flight and The Garden is probably the only amazing song on the album. I have been listening to Rush since 1981 and of course a long time fan. They are amazing musicians and I was waiting and looking forward to this for so long and find myself extremely disappointed.<br /><br />I can listen to any of their other 19 releases over and over again but this I cannot. I am not putting down the band as musicians nor am I calling this release garbage.<br /><br />I hold the highest respect for Rush,<br /><br />You can label me a troll if you like but everyone is entitled to their opinion.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|the image fills up the entire screen,  so you can easily see the buttons and screens.  If you touch the screen where toy can see the numbers you punch in, it will take you to another screen which shows you the history of all the calculations you've done. it's great!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|If you start reading Howey's work now you can tell people in the future that you were one of the original fans, because he will be a house hold name sooner than later with work like this.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|The BK2 is kind of in a category by itself; a heavy, stubby knife with a uniquely satisfying feel, that doesn't really excel at any specific task, but is rugged enough to take on just about anything from an outdoor perspective.  After having and using one for a couple of years, the carbon steel blade holds an excellent edge, and with very reasonable care, rust is a non-issue, considering that the remainder of the blade is painted.  Keep an eye on the handle bolts, however, since they will rust when the overall knife gets wet.<br /><br />The Kydex sheath is EXCELLENT, and reports of the plastic sheath dulling the carbon steel blade have no reality in my experience.  NOTE - however - the Kydex sheath is rated EXCELLENT once you have removed the big floppy belt loop and unnecessary handle strap, and replaced it with a Tek-Lok clip.  Once this sheath is fitted with a Tek-Lok, the usability of the knife goes through the roof.  One-handed draw and re-sheathing is beyond simple.  Ka-Bar should charge an extra $10 and include the Tek-Lok as part of the package; it improves the overall experience that much.  The retention of the Kydex sheath is more than adequate to keep the knife secure; the handle strap is just an unnecessary annoyance.<br /><br />Not a fan of batoning (that's what axes and saws are for), so I can't comment on the use of this knife for that purpose, but for all other heavy camping and around-the-yard uses, the BK2 has been a winner all around.  Again - when you order the knife, order the Tek-Lok with it.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B008CPZNL6|4.0|Fell in love with Flipboard when helping my mother set up her iPad last year. Tried Pulse, Feedly and others and while they are all good it wasn't quite the same (although keep checking them out because they continue to make improvements). I had sideloaded the Flipboard beta for Android and it worked well, but the full Flipboard app is so much better. Google Reader integration worked immediately. This is a major plus since the Kindle Fire does not allow direct connection to Google apps forcing you to go through the Web browser. Hope they change that soon so I can use Google Calendar to sync my work calendar.<br /><br />Tried to add Twitter and Google+ and had some difficulties at first but it has finally linked to my Flipboard account so all is well. If you have trouble, keep trying. Twitter linked after a couple attempts but it took a couple days before I had success with Google+ and it looks good on the Kindle Fire.<br /><br />While I am not a frequent Twitter user (maybe once every couple months) that will change with the integration to Flipboard. Why? Because by using Twitter Lists you can create a group of items to view. For example, I have a Twitter list called Authors and can view that list on Flipboard to read posts by some of my favorite authors for book signings, book releases, general commentary, etc.<br /><br />With Flipboard I will probably revert to my news junkie phase. It is a much easier and cleaner way to obtain national and international news since the TV \\"news\\" channels turned me off several years ago.<br /><br />While the Flipboard app deserves 5 stars I am only giving it 4 stars because of what I believe are some of the Kindle Fire limitations. Updating the feeds can take a while and it does freeze on occasion (but less than the beta version).
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is awesome because it has sales for points not real money. It has a button if you want to buy stuff.  for real money.

0307592731|4.0|Cheryl Strayed's \\"Wild\\" is as much a primer of what NOT to do as it is a reminder of what not to judge. The author's impetuous lack of preparation results in painful, physical tolls she pays on the PCT but the emotional healing she experiences is the dividend she receives. I found myself wanting to \\"mother\\" the 26-y-o. I wanted to warn of her of potential dangers and the strife along her path but the book is an amazing reminder that no one else can walk/hike our walk ~ it is something we have to do on our own.<br /><br />Independence, and isolation, are part of Strayed's journey as she grieves the death of her mother and the dissolution of her marriage. Along the way, she is never really alone-alone. Her mother is there with her and I found all the metaphorical allusions (as well as the very physical presence of her mother as part of Strayed) to be very moving and very comforting.<br /><br />There are some readers who will be disturbed by Strayed's brutal honesty. Her pre-PCT history of sex, drugs, rock-and-roll shaped her just as much as her time on the PCT did. As any good memoir does, she is sharing her experience from the perspective of a life that moved on from that amazing PCT hike. I know many will (and have) judge her choices. I may not agree with or condone some of the things she did but I also know that this is not my story; it is hers. I appreciate her candor, honesty, and her reflections. It is a book I am glad I read b/c I know it is one I will not soon forget.

B0031RG846|4.0|We got this unicorn for a rainbow birthday cake.  It worked perfectly (see photos I have uploaded by the Amazon product description).  It should also be a toy she can enjoy now that the party is done.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|There's nothing quite like a good crime novel every now and then and \\"Gone Girl\\" most certainly did not disappoint! It was a nail-biting, edge of my seat, gripping thriller from start to finish. It is a book in which the author very skillfully weaves the story between the characters and plot. The story is told from the point of view of the two main characters, Nick and Amy. I was wondering who exactly were these characters? Were they exactly what they seemed at first or did they have secret, hidden depths?<br />The tension and drama in the book slowly builds, before reaching its final and very surprising crescendo.<br />I found \\"Gone Girl\\" to be a compelling read. It was well-written and thought-provoking. This is the first book that I've read by Gillian Flynn and I've already added her other books to my ever-expanding \\"to be read\\" pile!
B000002WYT|5.0|I like the first 3 albuns from DAVE MATTHEWS, and in my opinion this one is their best by far!!!!The band really shine with their powerful mix of pop, rock and jazz...I like all the songs...if you like rock you may like this one...
B006JJBFK0|5.0|With this release, Xandria have established themselves as hard-hitters on the front line of the symphonic metal genre. Neverworld's End is a varied album with the absolute highest musicianship and not a weak point or a hint of filler (of course, you wouldn't expect filler from an album five years in the making!). The band shows a major shift in composition and lyrics here compared to their previous albums, at least in part due to the departure of former vocalist and co-lyricist Lisa Middelhauve. I enjoy Xandria's former work, which was often quite relaxing as far as metal goes, but I prefer the hard-hitting edge of Neverworld's End (primarily composed by founder and guitarist/keyboardist Marco Hebaum), with the debut of Xandria's sublimely talented and versatile new vocalist Manuela Kraller. As I mentioned, the album contains a variety of song styles, from aggressive headbangers (Soulcrusher, Blood on my Hands, Cursed) to ballads (Forevermore, The Dream is Still Alive, A Thousand Letters) to exotic epics (A Prophecy of Worlds to Fall, The Nomad's Crown), each song distinct and complex on its own. The album is a coherent musical journey: there are several motifs that pop up throughout the album, and the speed and bombast wax and wane so as to keep you engaged but not exhuasted. Unlike many other bands, they don't abuse the `symphonic' part of symphonic metal; instead of drowning themselves out with bombast, Xandria uses orchestral parts primarily to follow and accent the band's melodies, the orchestra taking a backseat to the bands' stellar instrumentation. I don't think I can overstate how refreshing that is! I also like that the orchestration often performs well-composed Celtic or Middle Eastern/Indian melodies (such as in The Call of the Wind and The Nomad's Crown), a Xandria signature.<br /><br />Everybody and their dog has already pointed out that Manuela sounds similar to the superlative Tarja Turunen. Like Tarja, Manu is a heavy soprano (in terms of vocal weight, not body size :-P) with a dark timbre, wide range, high tessitura, and classical training. Still, I disagree with those who dismiss her as a clone, since her voice is deeper and has a breathier, throatier quality than Tarja's; I find the differences in their voices more pronounced the more I listen to Neverworld's End. I think a dramatic voice like Manu's is especially well-suited to heavy metal, sounding like another instrument in the band. I like Lisa as well, and actually find that when Manu sings softly in her lower register, she sounds rather similar to the way Lisa does in songs like Eversleeping (Ravenheart album).<br /><br />Neverworld's End sets a standard for the symphonic metal genre the way that Oceanborn did in Nightwish's glory days. The album is evocative of Tarja-era Nightwish in terms of depth, complexity, and musicianship, which Lisa (wife of bassist Nils Middelhauve) has said was one of Xandria's goals. However, I find a persistent power metal element in Neverworld's End that has been absent from Nightwish's work since Wishmaster. Some may denounce the supposed lack of originality, but as far as I'm concerned, Neverworld's End is superb in every way and heck, I've really missed this kind of epic effing METAL since Nightwish's Once, so I'm not complaining :-). Please, Xandria, continue bringing the awesome!
B000056K04|3.0|EVERYDAY is clearly the album where DAVE and his GREAT band decided to took a POP direction for their music...DREAMS OF OUR FATHERS, WHAT YOU ARE, SO RIGHT and WHEN THE WORLD ENDS are among the greatest moments from DAVE MATTHEWS and band....

0345803493|3.0|This one was much better than Fifty Shades of Grey. It read much more like an adult novel and Ana got on my nerves less. Ana's \\"Oh my's\\" & \\"Holy cows\\" occurred less frequently which I applaud. Once they agreed to discontinue the D/s farce the story got a little better. But Christian lost a little of his hard edge trying to conform to a vanilla relationship and I'm not sure I like that. This series so far is entertaining & I'm about to start reading Fifty Shades Free.
030758836X|5.0|Wow! Is all I can say. I started reading this around 11 am this morning because my 4 kids are out of town and I had a quiet house. I just put it down and finished it 8 hours later..I didn't eat, drink or even pee!<br /><br />I love watching the ID channel and every show on there as well as all the crime dramas on t.v.  Every crime show and drama and real life news rolled into one. This had everything...very current references, my mind was picking up on subtle clues and trying to figure out did he? would he? I love that it is told thru each character also..kept me guessing!<br /><br />I was hooked...so many twists and the character development was great....A MUST read. I need to find some more of the author's works and get to reading!
0345803485|1.0|I owe an apology to everyone who ever lended a hand in teaching me to read as a child. I did them a great disservice by attempting to read this book. Yes. It's that f-ing stupid. But that's just the embarrassingly horrid writing. Oh yeah, and the childlike plot written by formula.<br />The sex part really taught me a lot. I didn't know women wanted to be treated that way but by way of sales and reviews they apparently find misogynist treatment \\"hot.\\". I didn't know women were so easily orgasmic. I didn't know virgins enjoy there first time to be \\"hard.\\". Seriously, though, the fact that women seem to love this book and find it hot has me re-examining my attitude toward the masses of women. If you are a woman reading this I can tell you as an attractive upper middle class well/educated 40 year old a woman I can dominate is the last thing that interests me. An established sophisticated woman with her own mind on the other hand...  Oh, and one last thing. The product placement. It's one big commercial for Audi, Converse, Twinings Tea.
B00846REIS|3.0|This book was ok--by all means I would suggest it for a quick read, but the characters feel in love so fast that it really is unrealistic for all of the drama to occur in such a short period of time.  And there is no way that a normal person would stay in a relationship that had so many problems right off the bat--that being said I know that the story isn't meant to be real or on real time, but I just wanted more of them so maybe in the second novel (which I will buy) the characters will be more developed.
051755075X|5.0|I will keep this simple and concise.  The reasoning behind the purchasing decision of this book is easy to understand.  Mr. Ogilvy was a advertising pioneer and was willing to share his experiences in the industry to up-and-coming talents like myself.<br /><br />I had doubts about the book because if the book was to be a \\"how to\\" for advertising, how would it stack up to the advertising world of 2012?  To my surprise and delight, the book is extremely relevant for any copywriter, art director, account executive or higher executive level who wishes to learn to become better at their trade in todays age.  If you are a freelance worker, it will help as well.  If you wish to find advice on digital media, there is no mention of that but the principles still apply to any medium of advertising and Mr. Ogilvy maps them out perfectly.<br /><br />It is a great book and will benefit any who wish to learn from an idol.  Enjoy.
B003YFIUW8|3.0|This is one of the most original books I've read given that is told from the perspective of a 5 yr old boy who have never known anything but his mother, the room & the man keeping them captive there (also his father). However, that perspective also makes it one of the most difficult books to read at times. I truly enjoyed the originality of it but sometimes found myself wishing it was being told more from the adult perspective.<br /><br />Also, I was a little annoyed at the introduction of the mother's character being adopted since it seemed to lead nowhere in the storyline & was completely irrelevant to the rest of the story.<br /><br />While it isn't the best thing I've ever read, it's still worth reading just because of the perspective from which its told.
B001YYQ9SS|4.0|It is a very pretty movie and I enjoyed learning about the FFVII characters. I couldn't quite figure out the point/moral of the story though. It seemed like Cloud was struggling with something, but the ending didn't really make me feel like he'd made progress resolving his issues. Just a big fight scene. Meh. Still a lot of fun.

B0073LJ61S|4.0|The album rocks. If you love vintage VH, you will enjoy this album. Eddie and Alex are at the top of their game. Roth is unquestionable the best frontman for the band but his voice was never great and he doesn't attempt any high notes here. The songs Blood and Fire, As Is, Outer Space, She's the Woman and Big River are instant classics. You and Your Blues, China Town, Honeybabysweetiedoll, and Stay Frosty are very strong as well. Tattoo, The Trouble with Never, Bullethead and Beats Workin are weak IMO. Considering the band's age, the turmoil, and the disastrous VH3 14 years ago, this album easily exceeds expectations.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|This app is really easy to use and has a ton of features, as well as, the ability to upload your pic straight to social media. Love it so far!

0345803485|1.0|Shallow dialogue. Zero character development. No plot whatsoever. Awful, sophomoric writing. I don't understand how this book enraptures so many women.  All I can do is shake my head at the society we've produced who gobble this garbage up. The author could have written this book in 200 pages or less. Instead, she has blabbered on and on about Christian's deep, dark, disturbed past ad nauseam. Of course, there's no closure, as the author had to sell two more books to maximize her profit. Shame on us for buying this vapid, dull, poorly written piece of trash. I'm glad my friend loaned me her copy as I'd have been livid spending $10 of my own money to download on my Kindle. What a waste of time. If you really want some good well written romance novels, check out some of my reviews and pay close attention to those I've awarded five stars to such as Johanna Lindsey's, Prisoner of My Desire (for those who want the dominant/submissive thread). Lisa Kleypas and Judith McNaught are two other authors who have some FABULOUS titles with the erotic love scenes people can't seem to get enough of, PLUS, good characters, plot, and dialogue. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to try and read the SPOILER alerts for the next two books just so I can learn what plagued this bastard and turned him into such a freak. I'm owed at least that much. Stupid book.

006197806X|5.0|This book is perfect. There're just no other words for it. From the moment I started, I was sucked into this new world and the new Lena. Part of it is because I was in the perfect mood when reading this. The other part is just the beautiful writing and narration that gripped me from beginning to end.<br /><br />Lena is a different person in this one compared to Delirium. In the first book, she's a naïve girl who believed everything the government told her about deliria. However, in this one, we see a girl who's known loss and carries it with her every day. She's no longer spoiled, but become stronger for living in the harshness of the Wilds. In a way, she's hardened herself against loss despite the pain she carries with her. I love how Lauren Oliver showed us how Lena changed and how life in the Wild was through the chapter changes.<br /><br />This is perhaps why this book was heartbreaking. Lena and Julian's blossoming love was sweet but sad at the same time. It was forbidden romance, not just for Julian, but for Lena as well. I can feel her pain whenever she thought of Alex. That sense of confusion and guilt and tragic loss is impossible to ignore and made this book memorable.<br /><br />As always, Lauren Oliver is a phenomenal writer whose words brought the characters alive. Everyone played an important role and stood out from one another. They all share the same burden and the same goal, but it was interesting to see how they all achieved it. Each one had their own story and I loved learning about them. I can't wait to revisit these characters again!<br /><br />I have to say something about the ending. It was really predictable. I hoped it wouldn't happen just because I wanted the book to shock me and give me something new. Anyway, Julian feels a lot more real to me than Alex. Alex never truly stood out to me in the last book until the end. He was someone to show Lena the way to her change. Now Lena has matured so her feelings for Julian felt more real. I wantto cry for Lena because I just want her to be happy! Why is it that just when she's happy something comes along to ruin it?<br /><br />I would recommend this book to everyone! I wasn't a big fan of Delirium, but this one has completely changed my mind. This book satisfied my need for fast-paced action while simultaneously providing a heartbreaking love story. I can only say that I regret not reading this sooner!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This has to be one of the worst written books I've ever read, and I'm an avid reader.  The inane drivel continues page after page.  The only reason I can figure out why the book received any ratings higher than one star is because people heard the hype, they hadn't read ANY books in years and years, and have no basis to compare it to quality work. The only tiny, redeeming feature I found is that I enjoy classical music.  I looked up a couple of references in the book, and the music is beautiful. Otherwise, it was a waste of time and money.
0061245097|5.0|This book is sooo freaking amazing!! Why? Why did I wait so long to read this after the first one? There're no words to describe the awesomeness that is this book, but I will try, because that's why I'm writing this!<br /><br />The book picks up several years after the first one. Cat is now working for the government in the secret department fighting the evil undead. She's no longer that young college girl going out on nights trying to kill a vampire, but now she's this kick-ass agent that leads her own team to kill or capture her targets.<br /><br />I loved Cat in this one. She's super no-nonsense and knows exactly what she's doing. She's also grown up a lot since the first book. Whereas in the previous one she's lonely and figuring things out, in this one we really saw the connections she's formed with her team members, whom I also loved as well. Seeing Cat hunting vampires and using the things Bones had taught was just so much fun! However, there were some parts that are super grisly which I'd just rather forget about.<br /><br />When Bones comes back to her life, Cat has to decide if she will try their relationship again or just run away for a second time. I'd forgotten how much I loved Bones. He's a super-hot vampire that can throw cars around and rides a Ducati. And British accents? *drools* Need I say more? And I finally got a chance to read the famous Chapter 32!! I'm going to go read it again after writing this review! Oh man, lucky Cat! I would never get out of bed if Bones was mine!<br /><br />This book was just full of fast-paced action and laugh out loud humor, not to mention some shocking twists and turns that I never would've expected. Every time I thought I came to a stop point something else happens to make me keep going. Anyway, I cannot rave enough about this book! Just go read it now!
B001TH7GT6|5.0|This video cable was used in liew of an HDMI cable to connect a new HD tv to my Cable Box.  HDMI was not used since TV's audio not desired.  I am using a separate optical cable to connect the Cable Box's audio signal to an AV receiver/Surround System.  Both video and audio work great. Now I have to decide what to do with the HDMI cables that came with the TV and the Cable Box.
1416972250|5.0|Wow, I can't believe I finally finished this book. I swear, it took me a week to read this, not because it wasn't a great book, but because I just had so many things going on. In fact, this book had one of the best beginnings I've read that sucked me right into the story. It began pretty soon after the end of the last book and Clary is getting ready go to Idris to find the warlock that can wake up her mother. The entire book felt like a rollercoaster that began with a huge drop and continued on with twists and turns until the very end!<br /><br />I don't know if I can do this book justice in just how amazing it was. The world-building was phenomenal. I felt like I was in Idris and Alicante with its glittering demon powers reaching into the sky. Throughout the entire book, there was an undercurrent of tension and sadness. Because of the upcoming war with Valentine, everyone is worried. Bad things also keep happening one by one. Every character that we've come to know is facing one crisis or another. So it was not a happy or lighthearted book, but it was still amazing!<br /><br />In the beginning, I had a bit of a problem with Clary. In general, I agree that Clary is a brave and kindhearted girl who's been thrust into a bad situation of not her choosing, and she's dealt with it pretty well, but in this one she was a bit dense and annoying. It's just she was so selfish. Because she was ready to save her mom, she disregarded everyone's feelings and situation. No matter what danger she's putting another person in, or the disrespect she's showing others, she had to do whatever she needed to do! At least one person died because of her stubbornness and thoughtlessness!<br /><br />With that said, I think my favorite character has to be Simon. He's changed so much since the beginning of the series from the geeky best friend to a vampire who's strong enough to live in this new world. I admire Cassandra Clare for creating such complex characters that all changed in some major way since we met them in the beginning. Valentine has to be my favorite villain, just because there was some good to him. At the end with him and Jace, it broke my heart. Sebastian wasn't as interesting just because he's too one-sidedly evil.<br /><br />The book wasn't as suspenseful for me as it should've been I guess because I was certain that Jace and Clary weren't brother and sisters (partly because I read the blurb for City of Lost Souls). Anyhow, I'm happy they can finally be together! I'm super happy for Luke and Jocelyn too! I, however, did not expect the identity of Jace's father at all. In one way, the ending to this book was a perfect conclusion to this trilogy. With these characters that I've fallen in love with, I'm glad I will have the chance to visit them again in the next book!

0671027344|4.0|This book was a really easy, enjoyable, quick read. The main protagonist (Charlie) is suffering major mental issues which were not helped by his substance abuse. The author really allows you to get inside Charlies twisted mind which demonstrates his talents as an author. If you have read & enjoyed the book by Mark Haddon \\"The Curious Incident About The Dog...\\" then you should enjoy this book.<br />Recommended.
0345803493|1.0|So, I read the first one.  I reviewed it with one star, but had the trilogy.  Of course I'm going to read the second book.  The most interesting page of the first book was the last page. When I started the second, I thought for sure that something SOMEthing would happen.  There were some story lines that could absolutely have been explored, expanded and complex enough to be interesting. Some are with Kate pulling them aside, Laila, Christian's 'secret,' and Ana's boss.  But all of them were perpetuated and \\"solved,\\" within a page or two.  It's like the second I say to myself \\"FINALLY, a story line!\\" - it's over.<br />Boring, boring, boring.  As everyone else has stated, the same old verbiage is beyond tiresome at this point...everyone is murmuring, orgasming, and biting lips.  Oh, but silly me....I'm going for the third book. Someone please tell me something of interest will happen here.  It's getting to the point of skimming.....
B008CP93S0|2.0|A man  is shown in full-frontal nudity repeatedly in the movie (the man holding up a glass in the picture above).<br /><br />Near the end of the movie, a bunch of old men are also shown in full-frontal.<br /><br />However, there is little female nudity in the movie.<br /><br />There is a scene in which the Jennifer Aniston character and a bunch of other women take off their tops at a protest to get the attention of TV news cameras.  The audience only sees a blurred-view.  More female nudity would have made the movie more entertaining.  Especially that scene.<br /><br />Some of the humor is contrived.  The writers seem to think going on-and-on with a joke makes it funnier, but it doesn't.  When the Paul Rudd character has a chance to sleep with a good-looking woman with the permission of his wife (wife played by Jennifer Aniston) he is so nervous that he keeps saying strange things until the woman changes her mind.  It's unclear why the Paul Rudd character, who is level-headed most of the time, and has experience sleeping with a good-looking woman (his wife), would get so nervous that he says strange things.<br /><br />There is another joke which goes on-and-on in which male TV new-reporters harrass a female reporter while on-the-air.  This also gets less funny and less believable as it proceeds.<br /><br />The hippie characters are repeatedly referred to as vegan, but the Jennifer Aniston character is taught by them to milk a goat at the start of the movie.  Vegans don't drink milk.  This discrepancy isn't explained.  Nor are we told much about the food eaten at the commune.  A message of the movie is eat meat instead of unspecified vegan food.<br /><br />Near the end of the movie, one of the hippies physically assaults the Paul Rudd character, and the other hippies just stand by.  A hippie woman says that they believe in non-violence and so can't interfere.  As if they couldn't grab the assailant.  If you want to see hippies ridiculed in this way (and other ways),then rent the movie.

B005LAII08|1.0|Just saw this movie with several nieces and nephews and I was sooooooo disappointed.  Merida (the main character) is not lovable, but comes across as rebellious, scowly, and self-centered.  It's really hard to like her, let alone love her.  The writing was dismal - not enough laughs, the plot itself is weird (Merida follows blue blobs and happily embraces witchcraft?), and characters that could have been hilarious (the triplet siblings, the princes who were vying for Merida's hand) were never properly developed.  It was also sadly disappointing for the movie to have NO romance and I mean NONE.  Finally, there were lots of butts (bare) and breasts (much focus on a servant's cleavage).  Don't waste your money on this one!

It was almost like getting the player free considering the savings on the discs.
B00466HN6S|1.0|Just watched this movie for the first time last night. I had avoided renting it for over a year, as the previews I had watched convinced me this movie would not be one I would enjoy. Boy was I right! Though my kids said it was OK, I found it to be dull, nonsensical, and tedious to watch. Unlike many kids' movies that are entertaining to adults, as well, this movie put my wife right to sleep and drove me for my iPhone for rescue. Though the actors and animators did their jobs just fine, the boring plot, ludicrous characters, and lack of wit or real humor made this movie a real chore to sit through. One viewing was too many, and I give any other parents fair warning to steer clear of this snore-fest. Worst kids' movie I have seen since [[ASIN:B0034G4OWM Furry Vengeance]]!

This the starting point for Andrew Goodman's book- one issue which has clearly emerged from the first decade of the CPR and that is that there's a greater possibility of judicial pre-determination of pre-trial opinion which is likely to influence the outcome of final proceedings.<br /><br />And it will depend now on whether the written material is of a high enough quality from a skeleton argument or opening note for the court or tribunal proceedings... whether we like it or not!<br /><br />Goodman has produced a first class practical guide to modern written advocacy here taking on board the lessons we've learnt from the way in which the CPR has taken us... at least as far as the final proceedings are concerned and how we prepare the case.<br /><br />It all starts with how competently the witness statements have been drafted to follow the Particulars or Defence, and it has become the practice in many courts and tribunals that heavy reliance and emphasis is placed on the written word- probably much more so than before.<br /><br />The beauty of Goodman's new edition of `Effective Written Advocacy' lies with the working examples from leading current advocates so we know what it is that the judges want.<br /><br />And before there are howls of criticism, can we say that it's probably the best way forward to enable the best formed opinion to be made and to save a great deal of time avoiding irrelevance.<br /><br />The book is an advocate's bible both invaluable and compelling and illustrates just how far the role of the advocate has matured with the development of the CPR in the last decade as the practice books and supplements expand worryingly every year.<br /><br />The teaching of advocacy in the 1970s and 1980s was considered poor.  The re-structured Bar Vocational Course (as it then was) attempted to sort this out in the early 1990s but it was very apparent to the Judiciary that the competency levels of written and oral advocacy remained lamentably low, so the criticisms remained and there have been improvements.<br /><br />Now, thankfully, the direction Goodman has taken us in with this book is to be welcomed for the commonsense given throughout. Effective written advocacy is all about the use of intelligence, or attention to detail to use a less controversial word.<br /><br />You, the advocate, must know the sort of answers to the questions you ask, but to be one step ahead at the beginning before the face to face stuff starts the written word rules. It's what the judges have wanted for some time and it does help to simplify our court work at a time when many cases are now very far from simple.<br /><br />However, if you think it's possible to win your case before getting to court, Goodman will put you on the straightest track available although there is nothing certain in the litigation process because of the live witnesses... but the second edition helps greatly, and Goodman's advice assists the easier administration of justice: this book should be compulsory reading for all law students..<br /><br />The teaching of advocacy in the 1970s and 1980s was considered poor.

The authors have broken with the more usual approach to teaching jurisprudence which is to be welcomed for its innovative study method deployed here.<br /><br />New editions for Jurisprudence do not appear as frequently as, say `case heavy' substantive law areas so the authors have merely tinkered with the text to improve it and sharpen it for the new edition... and they do just that! So this second edition includes a rearrangement of the general sections, re-written where necessary for a more systematic coverage.<br /><br />With the advanced sections some new topics have been added, notably on law and deconstruction, and law and autopoiesis to name just a couple of areas. There's also an enhanced discussion of the rise of legal positivism linked to the rise of the modern state. The changing role of natural and human rights discourse is well covered to take account of recent developments.<br /><br />Professors Veitch, Christodoulidis and Farmer have created a very modern teaching tool here breaking from the old approaches so the book is very well described as `accessible, interdisciplinary and socially informed' and successfully takes account of the most recent developments in current jurisprudential thought. It is just what I need to explain modern jurisprudence to the worried student!

0981951244|1.0|The content of this book is almost as unoriginal as the audio is annoying.<br /><br /> The narrators voice sounds like that of a high school bully with a slight lisp.  It sounds like he is yelling at you.<br /><br /> The content is for the most part plagiarized word for word from authors who went before him.  It would probably be palatable if they at least hired a narrator with the pleasant voice.<br /><br /> He steals from so many other authors without credit but I don't know what is his and what is stolen.  When I read napoleon hill, or anthony robbins, or brian tracy, I come away with a feeling that I really want to meet this author and ask him questions.<br /><br /> After hearing this book however, I have the feeling that I would never want to be in the same room with the author.<br /><br />Oh, this book does deserve 1 star for the clever marketing.  This author could sell a pile of poo to an elephant owner.  That's pretty much what he did with this book.  I hope you're not an elephant owner.<br /><br />It's basically chain letter in book form.  Genius.  So if you hate the book, no harm done.  But if you're one of those few who never heard of Tony Robbins or Napoleon Hill, and your uncle never told you any obvious nugget of wisdom, and you lack opposable thumbs...if you belong to that half a percent, and you just love the book and you believe it will change your life and you believe everything the author stole from others without giving credit, THEN you will follow his advice on the last page and buy 5 more copies to give to your friends as gifts!<br />This is the last key to it all, that will make the author...eh, I mean YOU...successful!

0440244412|4.0|Well, it took 5 books but I finally got the majority of my questions answered. And boy, it was one hell of a ride. I was right up to the last 10% of the book and I was still worried about what was happening and what the outcome was going to be. Not every questions was answered, but the ending was open to all sort of possibilitiies that left the reader, at least me, satisfied and in giving each character their own ending.<br />  Now, I like to maintain a spoiler-free zone in this blog so I won't say anything that will give too much away (but I will later on) but HOLY CRAP I WAS NOT EXPECTING THAT. You know, that part towards the end? In the abbey? Yea. HOLY CRAP. I was so surprised, heck I'm still surprised and I finished the book over a week ago. But yes. WOW.<br />*So for those who wish not to be spoiled, beware. Spoilers ahead*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />V'lane/Cruce?! Dani?! Rowena?! Well, not so much Rowena, I never trusted her or liked her since the beginning. But V'lane and Dani? Never saw it coming. V'lane had me like Mac: vying back forth between him and Jericho Barrons. I mean, hello:<br /><br />\\"When his Fae name eased gently into my mouth, teasing, offering, waiting for me to invite it to settle, I breathed into his kiss and he breathed back....He took his time giving me his name, letting the impossible syllables work tenderly, slowly, into me, until at last they settled and I exploded, shuddering against him.<br /><br />Yea...I was swooning for him. But not cheering him on. Good thing too.<br /><br />\\"V'lane was Cruce. V'lane was War.\\"<br />~~~~~~~~<br />\\"V'lane didn't kill Cruce the day the king and queen fought. You switched places with V'lane.\\"<br /><br />Dani? I'm heartbroken and angry and betrayed and shocked and everything Mac was when she found out what Dani did.<br /><br />\\"I'd told her we were like sisters. And sisters, I'd told her, forgive each other everything. I'd caught a glimpse of her face in the mirror after I'd said it, when she hadn't known I was looking. Her expression had been bleak, and now I understood why. Because she'd been thinking, Yeah, right. Mac's gonna kill me if she ever finds out. Yet she'd still kept coming. When I thought about it, I was astonished she hadn't hunted down and killed those Unseelie, removing the damning evidence from the face of the earth.<br /><br />But quite honestly, I was over Dani by the beginning of this book. Her character's voice really annoyed me and I just dreaded when she was speaking.<br /><br />  It took Mac and Barrons this long for them to finally get it together and I'm really happy how it happened. Those two had me going crazy during the whole series that it made sense waiting for them to finally get together almost right at the end. I believe I'll finally demonstrating why my blog is called Books and Swoons. I swooned over Barrons, that's for sure.<br /><br />\\"Being around Barrons has always made me fire all pistons, and it didn't even seem to matter but that I knew this Barrons was a mirage. Some people bring out the worst in you, others bring out the best, and then there are those remarkably rare, addictive ones who just bring out the most. Of everything.\\"<br />~~~~~~~~<br />He had no idea the thing that had broken me most completely was my belief that Barrons was dead.<br />~~~~~~~~~<br />He'd seen it all: the good, the bad, and the ugly. He never ask me any questions, unless he thought I needed to figure out the answers. He never decked me out in convenient lables and tried to stuff me in a box. Even when there were plenty of labels to stick me. I was what I was at that moment and he liked it, and that was all that mattered to him.<br />~~~~~~~~<br />\\"I'm not the hero, Mac. Never have been. Never will be. Let us be perfectly clear: I'm not the antihero, either, so quit wanting to discover my hidden potential. There's nothing to redeem me.\\"<br /><br />Yea. I swooned and flailed a lot in this book. JerichoBarrons has me wrapped around him...err...around his finger.<br /><br />I love the open ending and how it left some questions unanswered, left to your own imagination. Normally I don't like that, but I think it definitely worked for this series.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|Like the title says, this cd is a masterpiece. It's without question, Rush's best material since Presto (1989), Power Windows (1985) and Moving Pictures (1981). Everything that made Rush great is heavily featured here. Cryptic Scifi lyrics, weird ass high vocals, insane musicianship, complex compositions, totally unpredictable arrangements, and tons of fast and furious playing with guitar, bass and drum breakdowns all over the place.It's the Rush we all love and strong as ever.<br /><br />Now while the majority of Rush fans are in agreement that this is their most inspired record in years. There is a minority of fans that don't like this album. The main complaint is the sound. Now what's wrong with the sound? It's sound like a modern record! That's it! Now there's absolutely nothing wrong with that but when a large portion of Rush fans are in their late 40's? - it's a problem. You see Rush sounds as modern and contemporary as Mars Volta, Muse, Coheed and Cambria, Avenged Sevenfold, Foo Fighters, Stone Sour, Deftones, etc And what's wrong with that? Well, those are the type of bands that a lot 40+ olds run away from. As a result they don't understand the sound and feel like the album is mixed \\"too loud\\", \\"messy\\", \\"without sonic clarity\\" etc. Let me tell you something, This album sounds absolutely EXCELLENT! It sounds like a loud kick ass modern rock album because that's exactly what it is!Nick Rasckulinecz (Foo Fighters) produced the album btw.<br /><br />In conclusion if you are a young Rush fan or an old Rush fan that is open minded to a modern rock sound then you will love this album. However, If you are a fan that never gave alternative bands a chance in the 90's and continued ignoring modern rock bands in the 00's then you will have a problem with this album because Rush sounds so modern. In other words if you like modern music this is a bonafide 5 stars album. If you don't listen to anything modern and spend all day listening to 70's and 80's records then thiswill be about 3 stars for you cuz it will sound too weird and alien for you.

0812993292|5.0|I thought this would be a light-weight, whimsical story. I was wrong. It has some whimsical parts, but the book is about a man in his quest to walk from his home to vist a friend  dieing from cancer. He had decided that as long as he walked, his friend would live. But it was a voyage of discovery and rediscovery of himself, his wife, his parents and his son. It is an introspective masterpiece. He exhumes and deals with the ghosts of his past in a random, haphazard fashion, but in the end emerges from his physical and emotional journy exhausted but renewed in spirit. The book far exceeded my expectations. Highly recommended.

B008602KQI|4.0|I like Jennifer Lawrence, she can act! After seeing her performances in Winter's Bone (2010) and The Burning Plain (2008) I have made it a point to follow her career. Solid actors and actresses are a rare breed in Hollywood so one best follow along while you can because once their first big budget, blockbuster hit comes along wherein style trumps substance, the days of truly human performances are gone.  Such was the case with Ashley Judd, Halle Berry, Tom Cruise, just to name a few.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I decide to go and see The Hunger Games (2012) because the movie looked to be a deft fusion of style and substance.  And for the most part it delivered.<br /><br />The Story<br /><br />Co-written and directed by Gary Ross, The Hunger Games is based on the Suzanne Collins novel of the same name.  Jennifer Lawrence ( stars as Katniss Everdeen a 16-year old who along with her sister, Primrose (Willow Shields) and mother (Paula Malcomson) inhabit a world wherein hunger is the norm and Fascism rules in a place called Penem.<br /><br />As the movie opens it is time for The Hunger Games, a vulgar little affair in which one boy and one girl are chosen from each of the 12 districts surrounding the capital fight to the death on live television.  The winner will be fed for life, but there can be only one winner.  Katniss' sister Primrose is selected from their district, but Katniss volunteers to take her place.  Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) is the boy chosen.<br /><br />My Thoughts<br /><br />Having never read the book upon which this movie was made I cannot speak to how close one followed the other.  I can state however that I did enjoy the movie.  Jennifer Lawrence turned in a meaty performance as the bow and arrow yielding heroine who uses her cunning to survive the cutthroat game of death.  I found her character believable, tough, but compassionate, and having never read the book, I was on the edge of my seat at times wonder what would happen to her.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is adequately dark to qualify as a thriller, but overly so.  The gee-wiz computer generated wizardry that has so marked movies out of Hollywood, was kept to a dull roar while the human story(s) were allowed to take center stage; yes my fellow movie lovers, real acting was allowed to take flower!<br /><br />The Hunger Games is rated PG-13 no doubt for its violent overtone; swearing is kept to a minimum and there is no sex to speak of.  Indeed other than wanton and sometime callous violence--something American teens are used to--there is nothing offense about the movie.<br /><br />When the credits rolled I was left wanting more, only because the story remained unfinished; this will be taken up by sequels, good thing because there were a lot of unanswered question dancing in the air at the end of the movie. Before they are released however I will read the book(s) just to flesh out the parts that were left on the editing room floor.  Final Analysis: see the The Hunger Games!Hunger Games is adequately dark to qualify as a thriller, but overly so.

030771652X|2.0|<spoilers><br /><br />Beatrice is living a perfectly reasonable life.  She has a good job, a decent fiancé, and a loving sister and Mum.  But she is too distant and lacking in emotion, unlike her sister, Tess, who is kind, loving, creative, accepting, spontaneous, not materialistic, and beautiful, in other words, totally idealized. When Tess dies, Beatrice knows her sister did not commit suicide, as the police insist and she investigates her murder. At the very end she reveals a plot by a doctor who wants to modify human genetics in order to create more intelligent babies (although his plan seemed so murky I'm not completely sure what he was plotting).  Unfortunately, this doctor hasn't worked things out well enough so the babies die of lung disease, and one of the victims was Tess's stillborn son  who was supposed to have have been treated in utero for cystic fibrosis, which he actually didn't have.  Beatrice tells us all this through a narrative directed to her dead sister and through an imaginary, we at long last find out, lawyer.  To me, this is an annoying way to tell a story.<br /><br /> Some of the characters were interesting, but not Tess (too idealized) or Beatrice (too self-pitying, too wordy, and wanting too much to be more like her idealized sister). Among Beatrice's ideas of how to live a better life is to help out a physically abused pregnant girl (another not quite believable character)  and to have sex with a \\"beautiful\\" doctor who she thinks is married (no problem for a free spirit) and who turns out to be the murderer. Beatrice also has the profound insight that her father loves her even though he abandoned his entire family when she was a child.  Why does he love her?  Well, he shows up for her sister's funeral, seems upset, and puts his arm around her.  Right.<br /><br /> I found much of this novel maudlin and repetitious.  The plot moved along for me because I wanted to find out what happened, but it would have been possible to skim large portions the book without losing much.  The end, well, it just ends, without explaining many things, and was very disappointing.

B00001OH7O|5.0|1971, it seems hard to imagine anyone would have predicted that Bowie would follow up THE MAN WHO SOLD THE WORLD with his third album, HUNK DORY.  Where THE MAN WHO SOLD THE WORLD depicted Bowie moving in a harder, rockier direction, HUNKY DORY is different in so many ways.  Mick Ronson's stellar guitar work is turned down in the mix in favor for Rick Wakeman's fantastic piano.  The real highlight of the album, however, is Bowie's knack for melody.  While the previous two albums were good, HUNKY DORY really established Bowie as something other than a one-hit wonder.<br /><br />The album begins with \\"Changes.\\"  It's a song that may feel overplayed today, appearing in many commercials, but in the context of this record, it is an unbelievably well-written pop song.  The lyrics describe a man who changes his life so that no one will ever be able to pin him down.  This early in his career, Bowie gives the world his modus operandi, a pattern that would be replicated with Ziggy Stardust, Halloween Jack, and the Thin White Duke.  \\"Life on Mars\\" assures the listener that this isn't just another vapid pop album; it's a song that is rich in instrumentation and lyrical content.  Rick Wakeman's piano is brought to the forefront in the song along with Bowie's belted chorus and sweeping strings.  The song concludes with one of Ronson's spacey-rock guitar solos before giving way to bombarding cellos.  The arrangement early in HUNKY DORY focuses on piano-based pop.  As the album wears on, the piano slowly fades out in favor for most guitar work, starting noticeably with the thick, deep acoustics of \\"Quicksand.\\"  By the time the rocking, proto-punk \\"Queen Bitch\\" appears on the album, the piano is buried in the mix; this transition feels seamless.  A fan favorite, \\"Queen Bitch\\" is a rocking, glam-rock anthem.  Dripping with attitude, it would foreshadow Bowie's work on THE RISE AND FALL OF ZIGGY STARDUST AND THE SPIDERS FROM MARS.  It's hard to believe that only a few tracks ago, the same songwriter was performing \\"Kooks,\\" a song that wouldn't sound out of place in a Broadway musical.<br /><br />HUNKY DORY ends with \\"The Bewlay Brothers.\\"  Bowie was once quoted saying that Americans would love this song, as per their constant need to search for meaning in lyrics.  He was right; the lyrics here are chilling and cryptic.  Often speculated to be about this schizophrenic half-brother Terry, the eerie song never loses its sharp melody.  It's a sour note to end a mostly uptempo and uplifting album.<br /><br />While ZIGGY STARDUST is often regarded as Bowie's undisputed masterpiece, HUNKY DORY nearly usurps it.  It's just as good as ZIGGY, and in many respects, better.  This is an essential album for rock fans, especially those interested in rock music from the 1970's.  Standout songs for sampling/downloading: \\"Changes,\\" \\"Oh! You Pretty Things,\\" \\"Life on Mars,\\" \\"Queen Bitch.\\"  This is a remarkably consistent album that deserves to be poured over.same songwriter was performing \\"Kooks,\\" a song that wouldn't sound out of place in a Broadway musical.<br /><br />HUNKY DORY ends with \\"The Bewlay Brothers.\\"  Bowie was once quoted saying that Americans would love this song, as per their constant need to search for meaning in lyrics.

B007MJSSCY|2.0|This movie could have been so good, but the director really blew it.  The pacing was terrible and the storytelling got rather tedious in parts.  For the most part, the acting was very good.  It is hard to believe that such a stellar cast was wasted on such a mediocre production.
B00001OH7P|5.0|It would be hard to say anything about THE RISE AND FALL OF ZIGGY STARDUST AND THE SPIDERS FROM MARS that hasn't been said already.  Most of what you've heard is true:  it's a concept album about an alien creature that visits Earth in an attempt to save it (and humanity) from itself.  If this sounds esoteric, there's no need to worry; the songs here are grounded in excellent songwriting and craftsmanship.<br /><br />In retrospect, it's hard to imagine that anyone could really top HUNKY DORY.  In its time, the album solidified as a genuine artist and not just another one-hit wonder.  HUNKY DORY is filled with fantastic songs -- it was one of the best and most consistent albums released.  To follow this up, instead of revisiting that same creative process, Bowie created an alter ego to create his next album.  A risky move to be sure, but one that would soon pay dividends.  ZIGGY STARDUST is 11 songs of fantastic rock-n-roll.  It earns its \\"Glam\\" title primarily for the approach that Bowie took for it (costumes, theatricality, etc...), but make no mistake, there's just as much substance here as there is style.<br /><br />ZIGGY STARDUST begins with the amazing \\"Five Years.\\"  The song tells a story of a young man who discovers the end of the world has been announced.  The lyrical imagery used here is poetic, vivid, and captivating.  The entire song works itself up to a great crescendo and ends with the shouting refrain \\"We've got five years!\\"  This song has a sense of urgency and immediacy that carries throughout the album until its final notes.  \\"Moonage Daydream\\" is a fantastic, catchy song that ends with a fantastic spacey guitar solo via Mick Ronson.  It gives way to \\"Starman,\\" perhaps the biggest off the album.  The chorus of the song borrows heavily from \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow,\\" but that's fine.  Instead of blatantly stealing, Bowie has repurposed this chorus.  The fact that it IS \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\\" is significant to the lyrical content of the song.<br /><br />The album ends with the 1-2-3 punch of \\"Ziggy Stardust,\\" \\"Suffragette City,\\" and \\"Rock & Roll Suicide.\\"  If the first 8 songs recount the \\"rise\\" of Ziggy Stardust, these last three surely document his \\"fall.\\"  In \\"Ziggy Stardust,\\" the protagonist loses sight of his mission and gives in to fame, women, and drugs.  \\"Suffragette City\\" follows him as he objectifies women.  The chilling \\"Rock & Roll Suicide\\" concludes the album, notorious for being the final song before Bowie \\"killed Ziggy\\" on stage in concert.  The song follows Ziggy, a washed up, alienated rock star who turns to drugs as he completely gives up: \\"Just turn on with me, and you're not alone!\\"  Similar to the pleading repeated refrain of \\"Five Years,\\" we are left with Ziggy's final thoughts to end the album.  It's a sour note to end on, but one that is both horrifying and completely satisfying.  One thing to note: I may have focused on the lyrics here, but I must stress, these songs are fantastic: packed with great guitar-work, killer melodies, and vivid imagery.<br /><br />THE RISE AND FALL OF ZIGGY STARDUST AND THE SPIDERS FROM MARS is probably remembered most for its eponymous hero.  It's important to not lose sight of the fact that this album is a fantastic, creative piece of work.  40-years later, it feels just as creative and original as it ever did.  For fans of Bowie, this album is not optional -- it's essential listening.  For casual music listeners, this album is packed with great songs to keep you interested.  This is album is absolute classic on par with SGT PEPPERS or EXILE ON MAINSTREET; everyone should listen to this sometime in their life.  Standout songs to download/sample: \\"Ziggy Stardust,\\" \\"Suffragette City,\\" \\"Moonage Daydream.\\"<br /><br />ADDITIONAL RELEASE INFO:  In 1999, a remastered version of this album was released.  In 2012, another remastered version of this album was also released.  If you can, go with the newer 40th anniversary edition of ZIGGY STARDUST -- it's a much less compressed mixing, and the sound is superior in almost every way.h less compressed mixing, and the sound is superior in almost every way.
030758836X|1.0|I kept reading through all the drawn-out, detailed story for the sole purpose of seeing how justice is dealt.  The ending is simply ridiculous because it does not match anything that the story leads up to.  This poorly thought-out ending ruined anything I did like about this book.
B007T2XC7A|4.0|Norah Jones' LITTLE BROKEN HEARTS has received a certain kind of backlash.  Ever since 2007's [[ASIN:B000KCHZK6 NOT TOO LATE]], Jones has been toying with her sound for each album.  Fans looking for music akin to her debut will be somewhat disappointed with this release.  The music here has been injected with producer Brian \\"Danger Mouse\\" Burton's trademark sound.  The results are mostly positive; Jones' move to a more \\"modern\\" sound pays off in most respects.<br /><br />LITTLE BROKEN HEARTS begins with \\"Good Morning,\\" a soft, beautiful, ethereal song.  It starts the album off on the right foot before easing into \\"Say Goodbye,\\" where Jones takes a new direction.  \\"Say Goodbye\\" is heavy on the rhythm section; it's sustained mostly with a kick-and-snare drumset and bass guitar.  It's probably the most radio-ready of all the songs here.  The following \\"Little Broken Hearts\\" uses many of the same musical/production tricks as its predecessor.  Songs like \\"She's 22\\" and \\"Travelin' On\\" reveal that the same songwriter behind [[ASIN:B000SXMSJ0 COME AWAY WITH ME]] is at work here.  They're bareboned songs that relies on Jones' voice and lyrical content.  The lead single \\"Happy Pills,\\" is fine, and it's a good indicator of what the album does right.  Jones' voice is just as good as it has ever been, but the songwriting comes across as uninteresting at times.  This modern/seductive take on Jones' music works in as much as it covers up some weak songs.<br /><br />This album feels like an experiment; in many regards, it works well.  Unfortunately, it feels like Jones has changed the course of her often so frequently that she may lose some of her followers with LITTLE BROKEN HEARTS.  For longtime fans of Norah Jones, I would recommend sampling this album before buying it.  For fans of Danger Mouse's work on his collaboration [[ASIN:B0050VJ29Y ROME]], the Black Keys' [[ASIN:B0013K6WLM ATTACK AND RELEASE]], or Beck's [[ASIN:B001NBK6GI MODERN GUILT]], this album is worth checking out.  It's a great album to play in your car, but it's not quite as enduring as past Norah Jones' records..

B003663XUE|5.0|Big Smile, Adorable Racoon!!<br />I've always Loved Racoons, I got this for my Collections-I give it a Big TWO THUMBS-UP, AND THE SAME TO THE SELLER-FAST-FAST-FAST!
B007CKNX28|5.0|I've always thought of Jack White as an artist cut from the same cloth as Nirvana's Kurt Cobain; both of these songwriters, above all else, champion melody.  No matter what the genre, Jack White has been careful to keep songs melodic; long after the song has been played, it's the catchy hooks that keep you coming back for more.  This has been something that Jack White has seemingly always had a knack for: from his debut with the White Stripes, to the albums with the Raconteurs, to the production with Loretta Lynn. His first solo album, BLUNDERBUSS, follows this style.  The songs here, no matter the genre or style, always rely foremost on their melody.  The result is a consistent and completely satisfying outing as a solo artist.<br /><br />BLUNDERBUSS feels like a culmination of Jack White's entire career.  There's material here representative of his work with the White Stripes (\\"Sixteen Saltines,\\" \\"Freedom at 21,) the Raconteurs (\\"Missing Pieces,\\" \\"Weep Themselves to Sleep,\\") his work in country music (\\"Hip (Eponymous) Poor Boy,\\" \\"On and On and On,\\") and rhythm and blues (\\"Love Interruption\\").  No matter the style of the work, the tracks are concise, brief, and consistent.  \\"Missing Pieces\\" begins the album, with a shy keyboard intro before launching into White's trademark vocals and guitar.  The next song, \\"Sixteen Saltines,\\" drips with the attitude and timbre that brought the White Stripes to the mainstream consciousness.  Most of the songs here are 3-minutes or less, but this record never feels short or unfulfilling.  The middle of the album features a cover of The Blasters' 1981 \\"I'm Shakin'\\" -- White recreates the song with the same dirty, rocky production that he treats other songs with.  It all ends with \\"Take Me With You When You Go.\\"  It's a song that, in little over 4 minutes, sums up the entire album: a fitting and enjoyable way to end a great album.<br /><br />This album is a great addition to Jack White's already stellar catalog.  BLUNDERBUSS simultaneously sums up and adds to the songwriters' career.  Fans of White's work in other bands will find a lot here to love; listeners unfamiliar with Jack White would do worse than to start with this album.  Standout tracks to sample/download: \\"Love Interruption,\\" \\"Sixteen Saltines,\\" \\"Freedom at 21\\" and \\"Weep Themselves to Sleep.\\"  Sampling the entire album on Amazon might give you a good idea of what to expect from BLUNDERBUSS.  Be sure to check it out -- one of the best and most satisfying of 2012 so far.ously sums up and adds to the songwriters' career.

B000TYWAUA|5.0|I feel this feature is bound to be one of the best, of it's era story line. Gerard Butler and cast made this feature the success it is. I never get tired of watching it.

B0086700CM|3.0|Game play for the beginning of each race is fun. Controls are intuitive and earning gold coins to purchase upgrades adds to the challenge. However, as each run progresses (and run speed increases), the controls become unresponsive and the screen doesn't refresh as smoothly. It worsens to the point that play becomes impossible, and your character &quot;dies&quot;, even though you controlled him safely. Very frustrating.

0061692042|2.0|Let me begin with this: \\"Canada\\" is written as a first person account by a narrator who is not totally reliable. And that is part of the beauty of the novel because this narrator, the son of a husband-wife flawed bank robbing duo, doesn't know all the details. And readily admits that is the case. It is, of course, told retrospectively because the robbery happened when Dell and his twin sister, Berner, were teenagers.<br />The parents are completely wrong for each other, and the only reason they married was--surprise!--Neeva is pregnant, and Bev (Beverly which he reminds people is a fine English male name along with Shirley, etc.) who was in the military does the right thing which, of course, was exactly not that.<br />Bev we learn has a checkered past, so it would be no surprise that when he runs into problems financially, a man who was always scheeming for a better way to make a living other than selling cars which he didn't do well at, because he is working with another bunch of crooks. So he decides to rob a bank and cons his wife, whose parents she has not seen since her marriage because they so disapproved, into aiding him. And naturally they are caught. So that leaves the kids to fend for themselves.<br />They live in Montana. And Canada is next door. So...<br />However, having said this, I couldn't finish this novel. Unlike many five-star reviewers' experience, I just found the novel boring, especially once the narrator ends up in Canada, so boring I no longer cared about the character or what might happen next.
B00177Y9ZC|3.0|Jumper is a thrilling, touching story of David and Millie in high school. However, when the film jumps eight years the romantic story falls apart.<br /><br />Max Thieriot and AnnaSophia Robb as teenagers David and Millie are just right with teenage angst and chemistry.  Hayden Christensen and Rachel Bilson as the mid-twenties David and Millie just does not work.  There is no spark, no chemical reaction.  Rachel Bilson is a talented actress, but her talent was wasted in this film opposite Christensen who never showed the exuberant teenage David.<br /><br />Samuel Jackson adds a nice touch as Roland, the religious zealot Paladin who hunts jumpers because they are an abomination since they possess powers which should be reserved for God only. Jamie Bell as Griffin, the seasoned jumper, carries the second half of this film.<br /><br />Diana Lane and Michael Rooker as Mary and William Rice are wasted in this film.  These talented actors deserved more screen time and a better script.<br /><br />The jump scenes are well done.  The fight in the coliseum and in Millie's apartment and Griffin's lair are exciting.<br /><br />The Paladins have a rich history of being warriors.  It is sad this film did not give a peek into this rich history.<br /><br />Overall, I give this film 3 stars for the first part with the teenagers, the concept and effects and for Jackson and Bell's characters which definitely save this film.  This film could have been a classic sci-fi if the story had been on David's rise from pretty thief to superhero.

B0007OY2P8|3.0|The ending is botched by being truncated beyond belief and the actress who plays Catherine is good but the script has her being too immature to fit the role perfectly by actually looking like someone Henry Tilney would be attracted to enough to marry.  Felicity Jones in the newer version sets a higher standard... Still worth watching.

B000Z27HLS|3.0|A movie does not have to follow a book but whatever changes are made should be in the spirit of making a really good movie.  This is especially meaningful concerning a PBS rendering of a classic author like Jane Austen.  Did the screenwriter and director make a weaker movie by altering the story in a meaningful way?  In this case, I think foolish mistakes were made probably because the director wanted to make his mark and satisfy his ego.  The result is a watchable and even enjoyable film which could easily have been much better.<br /><br />This version is actually less true to the book than the 80's version.  For example, showing Catherine running back to the Tilney house when she catches John Thorpe in a lie about her previous plans with the Tilneys being cancelled is not only left out but the entire scene is altered.  Well, Jane Austen put it there as a crucial proof of Catherine's character at this stage of the book or movie.  Stupidly left out...  Also left out is the full characterization of Tilney and Catherine- all they had to do is follow Jane Austen's lead as the 80's version did... instead they truncated the dialogue- again very dumb especially unforgivable because they had the 80's version to look at and recognize how important it is to the integrity of the story.<br /><br />What this version does do better than the 80's version is the casting of Felicity Jones as Catherine, someone Henry Tilney would find extremely attractive both physically and for her simplicity and integrity- she is quite perfect.  In addition, the 80's version ended the movie awkwardly while the newer version is excellent.<br /><br />Thus the newer version is somewhat better than the earlier version for the above reasons but watch both and enjoy.<br /><br /> A word of caution- you may want to ignore the ethereal new age music of the 80's and the phony echos of the newer version- both pretty poorly done and a sign of production weaknesses.
B0055MIS1G|5.0|Having pretty bad feet I have tried out now several types of footwear - Sandals, Clogs, slip-ons, etc.  Had been wearing only Crocs for some time when I pulled an old pair of Teva's out the closet - wow they felt great.  Forgot how comfortable they were.  Of course that style was long ago discontinued. So after trying many different Teva sandals found that these work the best for my damaged ankle/foot.  Provide a surprising amount of support & the shock adsorbing insole is great.
B0081KTI0E|4.0|Not that I'm a believer in the realm of the dead.  But I do enjoy watching the \\"realistic\\" possibilities of a paranormal event.  There is nothing that screams \\"GHOSTS\\" more than the old haunted house with spirits of the dead ingredient.  Unfortunately, too many new horror films jump into the realm of monsters rather than stick with the basic ingredient containing the spirits of dead people.  The latter gives me a more realistic feel.  I know monsters won't come through my walls, but spirits of dead people?  Well, not that I believe, but it's still way creepier since you can walk around your own house wondering about its history and who has died in it.  This movie is finally a new movie, which sticks to the \\"real\\" haunted house feel.  Sounds of footsteps, rocking chairs, dolls that seems to come to life, spooky spirits of once living people, graves, and a very old large empty house... all good ingredients.  They left Godzilla and Freddy Krueger out, which is a good thing.  Not since the Exorcist played with people's \\"realistic\\" religious images of the devil did I find a movie sticking to a person's true expectation of what is scary not only on the screen, but also off screen.  The fear jumps off the screen into your room because it sticks with the same things you would expect to see and hear should you believe your own house was haunted.  I loved it.  But it does come down to what you personally find scary: (1) A film that sticks with what you would expect if you \\"realistically\\" thought your house was haunted or (2) a film with gore, blood, and more monstrous creations.  Those expecting the latter would be disappointed, while the former would probably enjoy this.<br /><br />By the way, in that reference to the Exorcist, just to clarify things, I am not comparing the two.  Nothing will probably ever compare to the original Exorcist.  I only bring it up to indicate that at least this movie is a step in the right direction to keep \\"haunting\\" movies in the realm of the spirits and paranormal (like the Exoricist) rather than always jumping into the commission of \\"unrealistic\\" monsters.

It grabs you the moment Ana falls into Mr. Grays office. This trilogy is mind blowing. He's everything I'd want, and then some! The story itself is a sweet mystery, that slowly builds as you read it. I loved the other charters, and their stories as you read on. After reading some of these book to my hubby......well lets just say he liked it too. I don't recomend this for the skittish or prudes, its HOT. Nice reading.
