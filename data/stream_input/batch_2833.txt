0061547832|4.0|If you like business books and self-help books, this is definitely a must reading.<br />I enjoyed Donald business anecdotes even though he is very repetitive saying all the time the same things with different words.
B004C03TK2|1.0|This movie won't play in my dvd player because it not in our region. I should have returned it but could not find my return slip. What a waste! My son was really looking forward to owning this movie.
074356619X|5.0|Enjoy listening to these CD's during the day, and in my car. They are a great buy and give me inspiration!
B00947N6D8|5.0|Really loved this movie!  A great movie for kids. My kids have watched it several times in my truck's dvd player.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Could be more challenging but I still enjoyed playing it. It's a fun game. Graphics are great. Something the whole family enjoys.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Lots of action. Great story.  I'm so happy my little brother gave me this for Christmas. Will watch it many more times.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I choose this game because it was very fun and challenging. I would recommend this game to all my cousins and school friends.
B007K3JCAE|5.0|Fun, witty thriller that kept me guessing until the very end. If you are a fan of the first one, then this one is a must-buy!
B0002TJGQS|5.0|Great price and exactly what wanted.  Also, able to get them delivered and not have to go pick them up at the store, awesome.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Beautifully done effects, hinting at the destruction of Earth with major landmarks making cameos throughout, gives you the feeling of emptiness, even though the supposed civilization is a few thousand miles away. Morgan Freeman gives his usual role as the \\"father\\" of events to come, which I(don't know about you) never, ever get tired of. Tom Cruise doesn't let down, as he pushes for answers as his current reality and questions come to pass. As the story continues to march forward, you find yourself linking events slowly together, even as a major plot is revealed rather early in the movie. That is something that most movies fail to accomplish. All the way to the very last scene, I was satisfied. Watch this if you haven't.
B007SZ0E1K|3.0|I am mostly happy with it, but for unqualified and certainly not technical reasons, I wish it was faster. Just a bit.
0763660531|5.0|This is a gorgeous story, well-told through intimate detail and one's own imagination. It is delightfully refreshing to experience personal (and gifted) artwork that intellectually and spiritually surpass the two-dimensional lifeless cartoons and sassy one-liner characters that glut store shelves these days. It's clear this was a \\"passion project\\" and we get to be the richer for it.<br /><br />Journey is a smart STORY that allows children space to think without interruption, a rare commodity these days. The illustrations are stunning, the journey limitless. My 4yo and I are already eager for the next lush title, and anticipate well-deserved Caldecott consideration for Becker.<br /><br />A fantastic gift for the 3-8 year old dreamer in your life, and the adults who share books with him or her. This is a priceless gift of imagination and wonder.<br /><br />Highly recommended by this former elementary school teacher.

B00EFNXPFK|5.0|For the love of music stop comparing everything Mayer does to Continuum.  He's not even the same person anymore.  I'll bet you aren't still listening to the same music you listened to 7 years ago (with the aparent exception of Continuum) - why should he make the same music.  Things change folks.<br /><br />Anyway, rant over.<br /><br />If you liked Born and Raised - you will like Paradise Valley.<br /><br />If you didn't like Born and Raised - go somewhere else.  This isn't for you.<br /><br />Thank you.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Loved this book!!!! Best thing is it was fun and fast read but it went too fast and I cannot wait to get the next book...I wouldn't have minded if it combined the next book into one!
B006M4F67A|3.0|Isn't what I had expected. I have been wanting to learn to play mahjong, but I don't believe this is the way to go about it.
B00CXVX1OQ|3.0|The game is really polished with some customization thrown in and the ability to increase your monkeys stats but the gameplay is over simplified and doesn't present much of a challenge.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|It works like a charm, it gives me the information I need, I save files in this app and it works in my favor.

B005GFPZYK|4.0|Chris was am amazing man who paid for my freedom, along with many who have gone before and will go after him. For me it was good to understand what our solders are doing and how they might feel.

B00785P2QC|1.0|Not as fun ad the app on my cell. I will not use this app, it doesn't give you many options and I cannot pull the stuff or purchase things I no I have money for. Uggghhh.
B008CLI3TE|4.0|After watching all of season 1 I really don't see what all the hype is about. Actually, pretty mad they keep killing the only characters that I liked!  My friend that is obsessed with this show told me it was better than any other shows he had seen. I don't agree. I did not find the show overly sexy or violent as some mention, then again, watch [[ASIN:B003PIUBZS Spartacus: Blood and Sand - The Complete First Season]] for what I consider maybe too violent and sexy for most.<br /><br />There are some aspects of the show that do live up to the hype and are as good as any of the best shows I've ever watched like:<br /><br />--the locations and scenery were spectacular and fit perfectly for a fantasy story<br /><br />--the technical and image qualities are flawless and really show off Blu-ray.<br /><br />--Tyrion the dwarf probably turns out to give the best and most witty lines I've ever seen. He really surprised me and kept watching just to see what new crazy things he would do or think of! The rest of the characters were pretty predictable and you could pretty much tell what was going to happen to them.<br /><br />--The extras on the disk actually serve a purpose and are very useful. Helps you get a lot more excited about the series if you learn about all the different Houses, characters, and history before starting to watch the series.<br /><br />I would've rated it 5 stars for the above points but the other points I mentioned bring it down.<br /><br />I guess you have to have read the book to really get excited about this series?<br />Maybe that's one reason I didn't care for the show was too much politics and backstabbing for my taste.<br />I guess that's why I like Tyrion so much because he always tried to stay out of it and just wanted to have a good time!<br /><br />I guess I just expected more dragons, wizards, special effects, action etc. because that's what I think of when I think of fantasy. Maybe that will come in later seasons but I never read the books so I wouldn't know?<br /><br />But as it stands I will probably get the 2nd season just because I want to know what happened and the show has an annoying tendency to end with cliffhangers every episode! Actually, this is probably what part of the excitement is with this series for some but the longer you wait to see it the more likely the entire series will be ruined by spoilers because everywhere I go people seem to be talking about what happened on this show!<br /><br />I won't be in a rush to get the 2nd or who knows how many seasons unless the pace picks up and some more magic,dragons, excitement start to show up!<br /><br />I bumped up the review 1 star because it has one of the best quotes I ever came across and one of my favorites now:<br />\\"a mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone, if it is to keep its edge\\"--TyrionI wouldn't know?<br /><br />But as it stands I will probably get the 2nd season just because I want to know what happened and the show has an annoying tendency to end with cliffhangers every episode!

B00D6BQPMM|2.0|I do not suggest people spend their money on this film is so senseless and boring. I regret spending the money I spent to watch it.
B004N9DVW8|4.0|One of the best girlfriend movies!  Watched with my daughter when she was about 12.  Still a lot of fun.
B00471JSR4|5.0|I loved the movie, it is great..These kind of movies interest me. Can't wait for the next one to come out.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This is a heartstopper, well acted and well cast, with taut plotlines and a heart-in-the-throat pulse.  There are a few inconsistencies and things that just aren't believable, but overall, the story is gripping.
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|Love the movie..I am a big Bruce Willis fan and this movie was great and funny..Can't wait to see Red 2 and to get it to go with this one.
B00EFNXPFK|5.0|John Mayer delivered once again.  I really love the new 'country' dimension to his standard style.<br />I just saw him in concert, July 2013 so I couldn't wait to hear the entire album.  Paradise Valley showcases his range of song writing and performance genre.  I love this album and I am so pleased to see him depart from his comfort zone. The album is awesome and delivers again and again.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|You should DEFINITELY download this game. You can be friends with another player and you can look at their village, too. Also, if you get on to Level 40 (or something), you get to create a dinasour village. You'll have fun playing this game!!!!!! ^_^
B002MQYOFW|2.0|I didn't like her style of writing.  I thought this level of writing was more for middle schoolers although I think the topic isn't appropriate for that age group.
B00CUMM8LU|4.0|This BBC is similar but not as graphic as Tru Blood.  They have a werewolf, a vampire and a ghost all trying to live in this world with harmony and the thought that maybe if they live this kind of life that they may feel just a little bit human.  Then, all the weird stuff happens, they turn on their own kind, the others and then it go a little down hill.  Three of the original performers are killed off the series by season four and then are replaced by other cast performers.  Not a good idea in my mind.  But all in all the program has some good ups and downs and the fact the it is a vampire related series it gets one thumbs up.
1582406723|5.0|an action packed comic book full of surprises it is a great read I recommend it to teenage kids 13+.
B00EI6E17A|1.0|Obviously her Fame is just a fluke. This song sounds weird and the lyrics are still amateur at best. After all How long can you copy Madonna, Grace Jones, Kylie Minogue, Rousin Murphy and get away with it???
B002SRQ214|5.0|This processor is amazing. The computer is incredibly responsive and has quite a bite. My brother uses it for decently heavy gaming...and lots of it. Any modern/recent game runs perfectly fine on this processor. No lag, nothing.<br /><br />Highly recommend, price to performance. For windows experience index people, it is over a 7.3
B008LVCKH6|5.0|Takes a multi-faceted approach to two stories and intertwines them beautifully.<br />Very funny but there is a serious tinge as well.
B0046B3QTG|4.0|I thought 2 is better than 1 but 1 is still a good watch. I would not discourage anyone not watching this movie.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Love the extras you get with this DVD.  I watch it over and over. this DVD is a must for fans of the movie and broadway show.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|If you like to solve puzzles then this is for you. This game keeps you guessing. The levels increase in difficulty which makes challenging and fun.
0142405809|5.0|I just love this author/designer combo. They have such a fabulous way of finding relevant themes and making them so wonderful for kids.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very clever! Lots of fun and great brain exercise for the whole family. I love these types of mind challenges and was thrilled to see my kids getting hooked, too. They're 7, 10 and 12 yrs old. Definitely recommend this app. Finished all the levels in one day so hoping new levels get added soon.
B00AG473GE|4.0|Its just as I remembered it. Molly And the guys are great. It brings back so many memories. I recommend it.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|It has an easy vocabulary for those who are learning the language. I got the book in 2 days. The price is great.<br />Paulo Coelho is an excellent writer. I have this edition in portuguese and in english.
B00015YVD6|5.0|I got this for my daughter who loves mermaids, she is so happy with it. It has dated a lot but still worth it. Tom Hanks is great.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|It was a great read, and I highly enjoyed it.  You never knew what to expect and I couldn't wait to turn the next page to see what was going to happen
B000LC4ZF8|5.0|I watched this when I was young and my daughter likes Tom Hanks movies. She thought it was great, it's a good family movies.
0064471837|5.0|Garth Nix's Sabriel is without a doubt one of the best fantasy novels out there. The characters, the plot, the backstory/mythology to the Old Kingdom it all rocks. I remember my first time reading this my hands shook because I knew that I wouldnt find another book this good for a long time. I gave it to my little brother and my dad, they both loved it. The Mogget is one of my favourite characters. I don't think that I can say anything that hasn't been said before but to whoever is reading this know that if you like fantasy then you will like this book, even if you don't like fantasy you will probably still like this book. I have read hundreds of books and very few of them have elicited this kind of reaction from me
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Could not put it down. Good book. Like a good spy novel then this is the book for you. Just sit back and relax. It's a good yarn.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Oblivion was very entertaining.  The special fx were great, and the plot was thick.  I liked this movie because it was believable.  It never strays into \\"cheesy hollywood\\", like most big actor blockbusters tend to do.  But , that is only my humble opinion.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Falling Skies is a wonderful find. It is a refreshing departure from the &#34;usual&#34; of the past.<br />This is a genre within a genre. Usually this is not done well because the story is not centered on the characters, but on special effects. In the poorly done invasion series, the human and alien characters are without dimension or development.<br />Falling skies focuses on the individuals in the &#34;Second Mass.&#34; Development of plot and characters is rich and highly compelling. It's full of surprises. I highly recommend this series. Oh, and Season 2 get's even better!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is nice for people who has a real horse because they know how difficult is having a healthy horse. Also la good for people who always dreamed ofrecieron having one because the work that you hace to do is like the real one
B0063M22QO|4.0|It is a Good brain excersizer.  Relaxing.  When I have a few minutes to relax I always find this game and play as long as I can.
B006RZFACU|5.0|Love this author's books... hate clowns... liked the blue dog. Such a cute story. Top notch creativity. A story we will read again and again! 5 stars!
0451228731|5.0|When I picked Daemon up at the library and chose to read it first, I didn't know what I was in for. Immediately after finishing Daemon I rushed back in to pick up Freedom(TM).<br /><br />I don't want to spoil anything for anyone, but I would like to say that I have never read any other books quite like these. They were intense! Often the things that happened next were not the things I had expected. Daemon and Freedom(TM) were truly a roller coaster ride! No other books have ever made me feel as much curiosity, anxiety, excitement, and at times relief as these.<br /><br />Many of the themes in this story have concerned me for quite some time. Never before have I ever seen someone else tracking so many of these kinds of themes and exploring them this way. I'm so glad these books were written! And I think they were written so well too! These books should be required reading for anyone in a position of great responsibility! Until recently I've read way too much news wherever and whenever I could and it has always disheartened me the way each theme or element has always seemed to be isolated from all of the others. Thank you so much, Daniel Suarez, for weaving this story together! I think this sort of imagination and critical thought is important and necessary!<br /><br />The only problem I have with this story is that its left me wondering \\"What in the World am I going to read next?\\" Since I read these two books first, I've been unable to get into the others in my stack. Due to the pointed lack of interest I now feel for many of the other stories I'd selected, I regret reading these two books first, but I am so happy to have been able to read them! These are my favourite books so far and I can't wait to read Kill Decision and Influx! Daemon and Freedom(TM) have brightened pretty much my entire last decade!
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I love this app it is so fun and very addicting and I love this app because it tells you how to get a great education in a great way
B008FRFN7A|5.0|We recently purchased a WIFI compatible printer and now we can be in another room of the house using our Kindles or tablets and if something needs to be printed we can do that without coming up to the main computer and starting all over again.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I have had a Chromecast since they first came out.  It does what it is intended to do very well and works best from the supported App's on my N7 & N4.<br /><br />As mentioned, casting tabs or screens from your PC will, for now, be dependent on the horsepower of your PC and wireless network (internal).  Be sure to install the Beta Chrome Browser for best results.  There have already been a couple of firmware updates so be sure to allow some time for those to update when you first get it.<br /><br />I think one reason you see such varied reviews is about expectations.  If you have only one TV and want as much content as possible get a Roku.  If you like the idea of throwing content to several TV's and enjoy tinkering a bit then this is really great.  I have several Rokus, Android phone and tablet so it makes much more sense.<br /><br />Can't wait to see what the developers do with this. Fun stuff.
0394800184|5.0|Great book for beginners. My daughter loves it! I fully recommend this book; good way to keep kids away from Ipad for a change.
B003TOMAPC|4.0|I enjoyed the film. I saw it in the theater and thought it was entertaining. And it held up to a second viewing years later.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I normally go for the feel good books but this was a good one.  It made me cry and at the end I let out a sigh and thought life doesn't seem fair all the time.  I would recommend this book.  It is a unique story and sometimes we just have to accept that each of us has a different path to walk.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|This entire series is a complete rip off of Fifty Shades of Grey.  No originality at all, only the character names and the city was changed.  The worse part is it is not nearly as gripping as 50 Shades.  This author should be sued for copyright infringment.  Terrible series of books. I would not recommend.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Brilliant, transparent language in a story filled with surprises, twists, turns, sadness, hope, grief, and a generous sharing of spirit. The language is the skilled kind of writing that doesn't intrude but carries one along and is entirely relevant to the story, not to the writer's &#34;showing off&#34; of literary skills, even though turns of phrase and descriptions of the countryside are beautifully rendered (England is nearly as much a character as Harold, his wife, his son, and Queenie--the object of Harold's quest). If you're looking for a tale that challenges your perceptions about life and why people do what they do (including you, the reader), this is a wonderful way to examine deeply held conceits--and perhaps consider changing them.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this book every few years, and always enjoy the heck out of it. I'm less enthralled with the rest of the series (I enjoyed those books; but don't feel the need to re-read them).
0792156684|5.0|Titanic -DVD ... a true classic.. love story, entertaining, historical... i would say one of the best movies ever made
B00395ZYVS|5.0|We have chosen this for our book club.  Everyone has enjoyed reading it and eagerly awaits the review in September.<br />There is so much about adoption, acceptance, guilt, the terrible problems of extreme poverty, about India, about relation-ships and love.  Well written and fascinating.

B0000AK7AA|5.0|Bought this dvd for our dvd collection i love family halloween movies and this is one of the best i grew up watching and want my kids to as well
B00475AYJQ|5.0|This is one of the best novels (series of novels, really) that I've read in years. Patrick Rothfuss writes gorgeous prose, and the tangled layers of his stories within stories have a symmetry that will draw you in and possess your heart.
055357342X|5.0|Whenever a series enters into it's second act, fans and critics and even creators alike are quick to draw comparisons to \\"The Empire Strikes Back.\\" It's an almost pretentious way of saying \\"this is the dark, character-driven sequel that tops everything before it.\\"<br /><br />So all I'm going to say is this. \\"A Storm of Swords\\" is the dark, character-driven sequel that tops everything before it.<br /><br />What can I say about \\"A Storm of Swords\\" that hasn't been said already a thousand times over? While the previous entries in his \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" saga have bucked fantasy tradition, it's the third volume that takes the old formula and shatters it into a thousand pieces. Martin knows what you expect and is determined to do the opposite, often to jaw-dropping effect. There are enough twists, revelations, and epic set pieces in \\"A Storm of Swords\\" to satisfy an entire trilogy of novels.<br /><br />Throwing in a plot summary would not only be counter-productive (honestly, there are about twelve main story threads here all vying for attention), but would ruin the fun of Martin's roller-coaster ride. The first two thirds build the story, while the final act is a nonstop barrage of plot, excitement, and intrigue. While Martin does tend to be a tad indulgent (a common fantasy pitfall) he more than makes up for it when the time comes to deliver. More attention is given to character development than ever before. Some of the cast find redemption. and others, damnation. Martin isn't shy about killing off characters.<br /><br />While the series as a whole juggles a litany of themes and sub-textual elements, the primary theme of \\"Storm\\" is consequence. Decisions made on the fly - be they for good or ill - never fail to come back on the characters tenfold. Whether through death, dismemberment, or something ever worse, karma proves to be a fickle, vindictive bitch in Westeros. It's a vivid reflection of real life and displays Martin's precision of injecting an almost painfully human element to his larger-than-life narrative.

If you haven't seen it yet, just watch it!

0143039431|5.0|One of the most beautifully tragic books I've ever read.<br />To be honest, the start was a bit slow for me, but it was necessary to set to the tone of the book. It wasn't till after about 200 pages that I was completely captivated.<br />The plot is about a family of farmers' journey to California to look for work during the great depression.<br /><br />This book teaches us that we can still show kindness to one another regardless of our own circumstances.<br /><br />Highly recommend it.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Love the series...I had not seen it on TV. I started with season 1 and watched all the way through to the current season within a couple of days.
B000GFLE1S|5.0|A ray of hope...  and a remarkable story of learning and doing and succeeding when it seemed impossible...  To talk about tolerance almost feels like a cliche, but it isn't...  Kinky Boots taught a lot to many of us...  and the Musical was faithful to the real story...  amazing and awesome
B00C81AVNU|5.0|I saw the movie many years ago and was overwhelmed with JOY that this was a true story!!!  I am 77 and have watched and lived through many many changes...  made my heart sing!  And I saw it with friends who felt the same way....<br />When I read that Kinky Boots was going to be a Musical, I KNEW!!!  it would be a Tony winner...  just flat out knew it!!!  and I got my ticket as soon as I could...  and I saw it... and it was absolutely EVERYTHING I hoped for and more...  and all done on 6 inch spike heels by MEN!!!  And I am taking my two daughters in October and then going with my friend (with whom I saw the movie) when she comes to visit...  You betcha...  a total winner in so many many ways...  and I play the CD a lot!!!
0894803123|5.0|This is a really great book for people who love icecream.  I think the ice cream is so much better and I would buy any of their books.
0071771263|4.0|The test helps provide my student with the necessary skills to do well on the exam.  Personally I am glad to see vocabulary being tested in context and not having to memorize lists of words.  My student has been working on the listening part of the exam.  I have been seeing improvement with his scores in both the reading and listening part.  The questions on the exam for writing look very much like those found on the SAT.  I just wish there were more tests for practice.
B006I1OB0U|5.0|This is a must have before viewing season 3, excellent writing acting and the scenery is unbelievable.<br />My wife and I absolutely love this series.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|yeah as an app its an app. does things worthy I guess.got a very appy after taste. why wont it move apps on my fire though? says you can move em then whoops no movey for you! go figure. gday
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I had gotten the game for my great grandson, but found it to be very relaxing when I turned it on.  The kids love it and I do too.
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|&#34;Make that coffee to go....&#34;<br /><br />There are so many great lines from this mob flick that the folks who really love it and have watched it over and over (and I still watch it over and over) can spout off the one-liners and appreciate them.<br /><br />This is a mob flick at it's finest and is based on Henry Hill's true story.  It's graphic, funny, lewd and right up your alley if you like mob flicks.<br /><br />&#34;Dee Dee Two Times&#34; (that's my Mob name) loves it and says you gotta watch it for yourself.  Not for the kids though ... I'd save this one just for the adults.  Find your inner mobster and enjoy &#34;Goodfellas&#34;.
B00CZF87TY|5.0|My daughter loves this soundtrack and it was a good deal for the price I paid.  I can't wait for the Blu-ray to come out!
B003XYERRM|4.0|I'm almost done with the book, and I'm enjoying it a lot.  She's a good writer and seems to have done a lot of research.  Immediately prior to this, I read The White Queen by Philippa Gregory, which puts Richard III in a very negative light, so I didn't really expect to find him sympathetic.  It's very interesting to read the two books like this as they cover many of the same events.  Keeping track of characters is a bit hard because the cast is so big but it's well worth it to read slowly and try to keep the characters straight.  At any rate, she's done a great job.  I want to read more about Richard III as well as Elizabeth Woodville, two pretty controversial and important characters in English history.<br /><br />As for the missing star:  I had some trouble with the dialogue.  She uses the verb 'be' as I've probably only heard it from witches living in swamps and things -- like 'Do you be happy?' or 'I be scared for somesuch'.  I'll even give her that, even though it grated everytime I heard it. Perhaps people spoke like that, I don't know.  But the thing that really drives me nuts and stops me cold everytime are the verbal clich&eacute;s she uses.  There were so many.  My idea is when writing historical fiction, skip the clich&eacute;s.  There's no way to tell whether they're anachronistic or not, so best to avoid them. OK.  Direct quote, page 539 'dangerous as a loose cannon aboard ship and to put any trust in his word is like spitting into the wind'.  OK, loose cannon, yeah whatever but spitting in the wind in the same sentence???  Please.  I did look up loose cannon.  18th century.  Did not look up the other.  Here's the one that sent me on this rant: 'that dog won't hunt'.  Obviously, if they'd been hunting I'd have to let it go, but no, it was used exactly as it might be used today.  Again, who knows, maybe that character was the first person to ever say that.  It could have happened but when I'm reading this, I want my dukes and earls to sound like dukes and earls, not some Southern boy, not that I actually have any idea what a duke or earl of the 15th century sounded like.<br /><br />So, end rant. I don't usually let things get to me like this but the thing is, Sharon Kay Penman is a good writer.  She is so much better than this.  It's a really good book, well worth the read.  Maybe if you read a little faster than I do, little things like this won't even bother you :)nd earls, not some Southern boy, not that I actually have any idea what a duke or earl of the 15th century sounded like.<br /><br />So, end rant.

B00DNLXDUW|1.0|Wouldn't install.tried many times.they took my money and left me with a waste of time that would not move off of the first screen.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|You can't divorce the Revelation of Jesus the Christ from 1st century Palestine.  That so little is known about the historical Jesus is awe inspiring ,  considering the miraculous impact He has had on World history.  It all began in the murky darkness of an unknown time as an obscure Jewish sect in backwater Palestine and evolved into the World's largest religion.  Some have made a big deal that Aslan, a Muslim, has written  this book.  I would respectfully submit that a non Christian may have the greatest objectivity in writing such a book, and a Muslim would be particularly sensitive in his or presentation of Jesus because Muslims also revere Jesus.
B00CXVX1OQ|3.0|Nothing great about this game.  Same game play the entire time.  I only play this if I'm bored like stuck at the DMV or something like that.
B0026QC0TA|5.0|This was a really good book, and the movie does it justice -- it follows the plot of the book closely, and does not add any of the usual Hollywood plot variations.  If you liked the book, you'll love this movie.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|This book is outstanding.  I highly recommend it and want to thank Stephen King for being thoughtful and generous enough to write it.  Even if you are not a Stephen King fan, you will enjoy and profit from this book if you feel yourself called to writing.
1416595236|5.0|Flynn writes some real interesting page turner's on his protagonist Mitch Rapp and I enjoy his style. I do not have to reread the last half dozen pages or so as I tend to recall easily where i was in the book's he writes. Enjoy them all!
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Read it 3 times. I read it during a book slump- when I know nothing else will do.everything she writes is great.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is one of the best series in TV the dialog is awesome! I cannot wait for the next season!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|works well and sci calculator in handy too. no crash and no freeze opens fast and quick. big buttons are nice
B006GECE9Y|5.0|Outstanding performance.  I bought a terribly performing 10&#34; tablet - browser would often time out before completion.  Received a recommendation to try the Dolphin Browser and it took a tablet I rated as horribly slow and it improved the browsing experience to decent minus.  Very fast and easy to use.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is the best one yet being able to create a whole world out there in my own image!
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|The plot seems simplistic and somewhat boring. It's not the worst book I have ever read but does not hold my attention. I would not recommend this book to an adult for that reason.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is the best. Only problem is the elite players ruin it. Otherwise. A must have game. Don't forget to finish each r<br />oom for bonus.
B00A6HHJ9C|4.0|When I look in your eyes........<br /><br />Luke is fortunate because he seems to have it all: great songwriter, excellent guitarist, great voice, puts together a great band, and he consistently brings his passion to life in his music.<br /><br />Terrific musicianship, production and memorable lyrics and melodies. I like Luke's guitar tones and tasteful solos on this one...<br /><br />My wife and I love this CD.<br /><br />\\"Right the Wrong\\" is powerful and stays with you all day.  What a beautiful song.<br /><br />\\"Transition\\" - WOW, what a terrific keyboard passage from 2:30 or so on, followed by a tasteful and powerful solo to preface the lyrics.  Nice, Nice!<br /><br />Thanks Luke!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really need to get more levels. Makes you want to keep playing! Never want to quit. Luv this game. Some parts where tricky an make you think.....but still got through it cool game.
B00CS65JS2|4.0|My son had been nagging me to download this album for him, and I'd put it off for awhile. The differences in tempo and style threw me a little the 1st time I previewed the album.  The tracks have a different feel, but its still Daft Punk. Its a departure, but good.
B000URDE2Y|5.0|It is even better than I remember it! A true classic!<br />It represents a time when they were at their peak.
B00B2JSRAS|1.0|Let me say a couple things first. many consider these books new age. The concept of manifesting has been around forever. I DO believe we can manifest  and sometimes we need help in learning how. I have done it many times, even without knowing that I was actually doing something that has been around so long and has a name for it.<br /><br />I have read MANY books on the subject, a few of them, many times because they were so hokey in how they go about it, I thought I was missing something. The Abraham books are just plain weird, bizarre and creepy. The Secret is so shallow and more like an infomercial on greed using quotes and snippets of stories.<br /><br />To give some credit, the writing style in this book is ok..It can get really cheesy and try to be cutesy that it's almost an insult to an intelligent reader. Where it gets really cheesy and just plain dumb is at the end of each chapter. The dialogue she wants you to repeat to the 'universe'...I have no words for it. And some sample stories, well they are nothing but purely the way you choose to look at things. Roughly remembering one..\\" a lady wanted happiness, so she manifested..short story, she sat on a park bench, a stranger child sat next to her, they smiled and suddenly she felt connected and happy\\". REALLY? I also can CHOOSE to see a rock as a jewel if I wanted to perceive it that way. That's really reaching just to say something worked.<br /><br />Another chapter, think of a green car, see how many you suddenly notice in 2 days? That's not manifesting..that's putting something in your conscience and you become more aware. Being aware is NOT manifesting.<br /><br />I have read and reread many chapters. I tried them in various ways in case I was reading the instructions wrong..NOPE! I didn't wish/or try to manifest money, a car or anything like that..simply just peace in a situation..to have closure..<br /><br />You can't go around demanding things within 48 hours. Other books have said..put your intention out there and go about living with it positively until it happens. I'm curious if her book works so well, to expect things in 2 days, why she had to wait over a year for some things?<br /><br />If you really want a clear and logical way on manifesting, then I suggest reading Dr. Wayne Dyers book. Manifest Your Destiny. And no, I am not a lover of all books and things Wayne Dyer. Which it's been years since I've read and I will go reread it in helping me with the thing I want to manifest.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|These were so easy to use and I was able to allow our granddaughters to decorate all by themselves. Beautiful!

B0015DYIH2|5.0|Excellent read as always!! I've always enjoyed this writer's work and she didn't let me down this time either. I look forward to her next projects.
B00B935SUY|3.0|The movie is interesting at the beginning but seems to run on and on at the end. Turns less into a documentary and more into a vanity pic.
B005MYEPXC|4.0|Loved this movie.  Most of all I simply loved the Paris setting.  Owen Wilson did a good job of playing a Woody Allen type character and the young lady who played Adrianna was beautiful.  The music fit perfectly.  I enjoyed all the historical characters who played artists, writers etc.  They were all excellent from Scott and Zelda to Dali!  If you like Woody Allen, art, music and literature I recommend this movie.  Woody's best in years.
B00BBI9WD6|4.0|Well written and very engaging. As a religious person, I felt that the author handled the dangers of violent religious extremism very well without smearing religion as a whole.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Just shop on Amazon using Mobile app or website and you will feel the difference.<br /><br />Amozon is beyond the obvious.
B000P0J06U|5.0|Well, at least it has the Penguin in it! It's cool. i would say, watch it! But it may be scary
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|I have not completed this book but am about 60% done and it is great...I can hardly put it down
B00C3JU7D6|4.0|I absolutely love this album. The only thing I don't like I the size if each record. They are smaller than usual and you have to get up and flip it more often. That's the only thing I don't like about it.
B000FBJF3M|5.0|ALTHOUGH THIS IS A FICTIONAL WORK, IT IS VERY EASY TO ENVISION IT AS HISTORICAL. GREAT JOB BY THE AUTHOR!!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I must admit i had my doubts. We put in the dvd and for the first half I was like, \\"why bother finishing it?\\" So I put it on my Ipad and starting watching it when I was out with my wife, when she was at the doctor. Well from where I was in the movie (no spoilers) it went BAM! A character was revealed which we love to hate. I am not saying anything else except there was some role reversal. I am not saying from where. Worth the price to buy it. Well that's my opinion from a person who has a drive reserved just for star trek episodes and movies plus having them on dvd (including the animated series). Ta for now!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|There is no question that everyone loves the goofy and silly minions from Despicable Me. They have not only delivered with humor and laughter, but they still know how to make a game shine, even if they are only in it for a brief run. The case is strongly here with Despicable Me: Minion Rush. The app is definitely one that is not only fun to play and master, but captures a young generation who has been hooked on bigger games like Temple Run. I like the game not only because it is simple to play, but very easy to control as well. What I do feel though is that if you have played one game, you've played them all, as the game plays similar to the challenge of Temple Run, but it is fun nevertheless for its value. I definitely recommend the challenge of this great game.<br /><br />Graphics: B<br /><br />Sound: B+<br /><br />Control: B-<br /><br />Fun & Enjoyment: B+<br /><br />Overall: B
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is the most addictive show on television/ amazon.  I can't wait for season 4.<br />I would recommend this show for the whole adult family members,
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I enjoyed reading this novel, but found it confusing at times, as it skipped around from one year to another without any warning.<br />However the story was wonderful and unusual.  I have read his other novels that both gave me a better insight  into that culture.<br />He weaves a compelling tale.
B0029ZA49Q|3.0|The chest harness is a great way to have the toploader on the chest for a quick access to the camera. I've used it under my mountain backpack and in that way it was not super comfortable.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|really fun game and I cant stop playing it because it so fun and when I say it fun I mean infinity
B00942Y4IY|4.0|It was a great older movie, with lots of stars in their prime years. Get your Popcorn or Pizza ready and enjoy
B0001HAISG|1.0|My little sister is in love with this movie she wont stop watching it almost everyday she watches it and their is no point to watching that many times, it gets very annoying after the first few times
B00008J2PG|5.0|Monsignor Hugh O'Flaherty's power struggle with SS-Obersturmbannf&uuml;hrer Herbert Kappler, and his captain, Waffen SS Hauptsturmf&uuml;hrer Erich Priebke is a MUST SEE movie if you're a dedicated WWII History Buff :)<br /><br />It's based on a true story, and, as of August 21, 2013, one of the real players in this saga of Rome 1943 is still alive. But I strongly recommend you watch the movie first and then check everybody's Wiki Page. Otherwise, you'll lose some of the thrill and awe ;)<br /><br />Conclusion: Should I ever decide to pursue priesthood, Monsignor Hugh O'Flaherty will definitely be my role model.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this movie!!!  It's one of those that I will watch over and over again!!  It's nice to know there are other families out there that are dysfunctional...lol.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|This is a compact and functional product. I have previously purchased a USB port that required an adapter for Android devices to charge properly which is just another piece to keep track of, break or lose. It is really nice to have a single product that works with Both Android and Apple products.
0345803493|3.0|The book came in perfect condition and the shipping was fast. The only reason why I marked it as okay is because I just didnt like it as much as I liked the first one. I believe this story is just not for me.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Classic Sci-Fi film from a director with a fantastic eye for the genre. Clean, crisp cinematography and a real character with simple central problem (beyond the usual \\"save the world in 90 minutes\\" story) elevate this movie into another class. Way more heart than I was expecting. It's a shame Hollywood doesn't make more films like this.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I enjoy mysteries but this was a slow page turner. I forced myself to finish too much back and forth between who was telling the story.
B00006ZXSK|3.0|I hate writing reviews for you, you require too many words, and I don't want to spend my life writing, a short review like It was just what I wanted would be enough
B0058O84G0|4.0|Typically fascinating and compelling Follet fare . A brilliant exposure to the history of world war 1 . A must read for Follet fans .
0553382179|5.0|I recently retired and this book has proven to be my saving grace ! By using the system,my house has never looked better,my days are structured and focused and I am able to finish everything by mid morning. Thank you from a formally unorganized, unstructured home owner.
B008XBHBX2|4.0|For being an older movie, it still makes me jump, still has good special effects!!!! playback was better than other movies I have rented
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I love the way this is written and the exercises. The author writes with authority about physics and the mind. She also writes with a lightness and sense of humor. This book reminds you of important ideas while teaching you new ones.<br /><br />This is worth your time in every way.<br /><br />Joseph Bernard, Ph.D.<br />Author of Finding The Voice Of The Soul.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|really great price , fast arrival and joyful noise.  I have been playing nonstop since it arrived.  so glad I bought it.  not for kiddo though. adult content.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I downloaded the book and am presently still reading it (according to Mr. Kindle I'm approximately half way through the book).  I'm finding it a fascinating insight into the political times during the occupation of Palestine by the Romans.  The author paints a vivid picture of the goings on in Jerusalem, particularly the political details involved in worshipping at the Temple.  He also does a nice job of wading through the centuries of theological muck to get at what actually shaped the personality of the man called Jesus of Nazareth.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This provided a great eye opener into the treatment of the animals that we put into our bodies!  While I recognize that they are raised for profit so that we can eat them, I think showing respect for our bodies might start with showing respect for these other living creatures.  I would love to see this information given to more people  - any way this could be a freebie?
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I haven't done any of the advanced tests other reviewers have conducted (thanks for taking the time to do that, everyone!) but mine seems to be working great. I have a '97 Honda Civic and I've used it to charge a Motorola Droid and an ipad.<br /><br />I have to shove it into the cigarette lighter pretty hard so at first I thought it didn't fit, but now I appreciate the snugness. It seems to charge quickly and I haven't had any issues with it disconnecting.
B002KEZ96Y|5.0|This is a great film. However you define it, its funny - way funny. &#34;The Dude&#34; is a hilarious model of life, liberty, and happiness in America, and how the true definitions of those words are not always what the majority intends them to be.
0739352989|5.0|I receive these cds and I love them, although I owned the books, listening to these cds bought the characters to life. I highly recommend this company as well as these CDs.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Tons of fun for me, my 5 yr old and my 4yr old.  It keeps us all occupied when we need a distraction.  Plenty of different levels that get progressively more difficult steadily.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|After buying the books as well as audio books , I wanted to hear what music they were making reference to in the audio books, this music is great an I would highly recommend it to all music lovers.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|I didn't like this one as much as the earlier ones in the series, but it is still a good movie with interesting plot twists.
1594746036|5.0|great story and amazing photographs! I read this book on my phone first then bought the hard copy. i recommend it
B009KS4XRO|5.0|i like playing in the different countries and special games and wining game pieces.  I also like playing binge slots trying to win the special itmes in the games.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|I've been a fan since the very beginning and she has yet to disappoint me. I was extremely impressed with this song and am really looking forward to the rest of the album.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|You need a dictionary to help with spelling.  It is very important to spell your words correctly and and have the right meaning for word you are using.
B00CEB5QU2|3.0|This is such a unique solution for having wireless storage.<br />I have had it for only one day so far, and I have used it for about 5 hours<br /><br />What I like:<br />- relatively small<br />- light weight<br />- nice design<br />- setting up was very easy<br />- even though I was streaming media to one device and connecting through it to internet, the speed was not bogged down. This was my main concern that my connection to the rest of the world would be slowed down. I have not tested yet with multiple streaming devices<br />- firmware upgrading is a simple task<br />- managed to map it to my android device as internal folder, and now Google Play Music app recognizes my wireless media as if they were on my tablet ( see my thread [...] )<br /><br />What I don't like:<br />- completely turns off when the recharging cable get's disconnected.<br />So for example, you plug the device to charge it and you start using it, then it becomes fully charged. If you unplug it to take it with you; you would have to power it up again to use it. This can become very frustrating after a while.<br /><br />What I'm still not sure of:<br />- there were a couple disconnects using the Kingston MobileLite app. I haven't used it enough with Google Play Music app to see if it's the same<br />- I believe once the battery dies down, upon recharging it won't turn on automatically. This is also a key thing in my setup.<br />I plan on having it permanently installed in my car, so if I have to reach to the glove box every time to power it it; this would be a problem. If you know a solution or if you know this not true, please leave a comment<br /><br />Update:<br />I have just contacted tech. support and currently there seems to be no way to have the device power on once plugged into a power source. You have to press and hold the power button. Unfortunately, for my case, the Mobilelite is planned to be hidden away in my car and serve as a media server for my phone and tablet. Having to reach for it and press the power button every time I turn on my car would not make this device suitable for my needs.<br /><br />Manufacturers need to include a switch to have it always on or off by default. i even thought of permanently having the power button pressed, which resulted in powering on and then off, and then stayed off.<br /><br />I really hope Kingston would release a firmware update to have this feature as a toggle switch in their app.<br />Most likely this toggle would write something to the boot loader to enable it. Also, this feature would completely remove the issue when the device is disconnected from the power source and turns off completely. It should remain on and if it was off initially it should power up if the toggle in the app was set to \\"ON\\".<br /><br />My HP Touchpad running CM9 powers up every time I plug it for recharging.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great product. I would recommend it to others for sure.<br />But if you need it in a situation like mine, I would advice you against it. I will be searching for a solution(s).<br />therefore I'm taking one start from my rating.<br /><br />Kingston, if you read this, please make it happen through a firmware/app update. PLEASE.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Enjoy keeing in touch with my family and friends.  And also looking at other information special event, food, movies and stars.

B00A285OOW|5.0|So many of Philippa Gregory's books rise to the top of my favorite &#34;read&#34; books.  I realize that my only hope of dealing with the frustration of finishing this book is to look forward to the next one.  It is my hope that The author will continue Tim record her versions of the English royalty right up to and including William and Katherine and their newly born son George.<br />Keep writing, please.  You have a faithful reader!

B000002PCS|5.0|Somewhere in Time is one of the greatest love stories every filmed.  I love period films because, no matter when you watch them in the future, they are always timeless.  Of course, there are a few scenes in &#34;present day&#34; that seem dated...but it's a classic.  The music is some of the most beautiful, wistful and longing music every composed.  Be prepared to hear a running theme that repeats and repeats...but I don't think you will mind at all.  It's perfect!
B002RSQGQK|5.0|watch it enough (as I have) you may find yourself craving something new and different., but for a classic ------- you can't find better.
B000002O4X|4.0|I have always been a John Barry fan.  Most of his compositions have great feeling and depth.  However, Out of Africa...Somewhere in Time...and Dances with Wolves are the ones that really stand out to me.  Amazing and moving.  Enjoy!
B007FKI9G0|5.0|A classic with Michael McKean showing comic brilliance!<br />On tour with fictional metal band, Spinal Tap.<br />The band is in total denial of their mediocrity and diminishing relevance.<br />But it's all relative as end the end the band finds its elusive if not, imaginary audience.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is really good . I totally recommended this app it rules y'all<br /> I love this and play it lots when I'm bored . So there.
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|Not as good as his other books  Became quite boring in places. The story tended to meander.  In fact, I can't remember what it was about and I only finished it a couple of weeks ago!!
B009LXECF6|5.0|I bought this album for \\"treasure\\" but was surprised by how many other songs I really like. Very good album. Thank you for being truthful about a clean album, unlike Robin Thicke's claim of clean with \\"Blurred Lines\\" album. I will definitely be listening to more of you, Bruno.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Previously, we saw part of season 2 and none of season one.  Now that we have seen season 1 and the season 2 episodes we missed, the following episodes make more sense.  This is an outstanding series, particularly for those who want a realistic depiction of what life was like for British aristocracy and their servants in the early 20th Century.  The acting is superb and the story plots engage you to the max.  As a viewer, you must concentrate because there are numerous subplots ongoing at all times.  You also must have an ear for British accents as some of them are pretty thick.  Compared to the trash broadcast on contemporary American television, Downton Abbey is very refreshing indeed!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The acting is great and so is the storyline.  The history and costumes are wonderful.  I love that the class system is shown so well.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I grew up watching re-runs of the original series and matured as Treks were heading  through a new generation and into deep space. So, I was skeptical about a reset of the original. I was totally relieved when I watched the movie. It was fast paced and gave new depth and background to characters we knew an loved.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My son and I got into &#34;binge watching&#34; seasons 1 and 2 of this series and couldn't wait for the &#34;free&#34; version of season 3 to become available, so we bought the new episodes on Amazon Prime.  It was money well spent.  Not a single episode didn't leave us desperate to find out what happened next.  The tension, story line and character arcs kept us glued to our seats.  The first two seasons were absolutely great, but this one blew us away.  Can't wait for Season 4 in October!
143911000X|4.0|After watching the show and trying to find a list of &#34;The Code&#34; I ordered this. It is funny and irreverent and is as Awesome as Barney. Don't know if I would say it is Legen......dary though.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|One of the best series to watch with family. Great story line and can not wait till next series comes out.
B000002JSJ|5.0|This is one of the most under rated zeppelin albums.<br /><br />Nobody's fault but mine and Achilles Last Stand alone earns this album 5 stars.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This game is pretty hard but it's fun for a 6 year old boy to play when he's on favorite toy his kindle HD.
B002WTOXUK|5.0|That's why it's so kick ass. If made by Hollywood it would have had a bunch of lame, distracting \\"celebrities\\" in it to \\"sell\\" it. It would've cost a bajillion wasteful dollars to make. If made by Hollywood it would've been directed by, say, Michael Bay. And it would've sucked. On a massive scale. And it would've been meddled with to death by studio bean counters. It would've been tested and edited to impotence with moronic test audiences. Ok, enough. You get the drift. I will conclude by saying this: District 9 is one of the best films I have ever had the pleasure to watch. It gave me faith in the cinema once again. Thank you, Neill Blomkamp, Sharlto Copley, and the rest of you brilliant Saffas involved with this film!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I'm too ridiculously old to be this obsessed with a game. Great graphics, great quick play or extended play. My kid loves it too.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|This is essential reading for every person. We can each become our best and our shared lives can transform the world.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Outstanding. The revelations about Jesus as a Jewish militant were eye opening and of great interest. I was particularly impressed by the information presented in regards to the historical times.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Was really looking forward to what this game could be, but it took minutes to download and I hadn't even reached the first real activity and it was downloading again. Gave up waiting on it. Might work better on a newer device.
B007VDN1PA|3.0|I have recently purchased the product. My only concern regarding the scanned picture is that it contains some noises.<br /><br />I tried to take the picture without any negative or slide and observed there is a considerable noise is there
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Great follow up to Enders Game, showing his development and understanding after the first book. As you read, you begin to understand the depth of pain he felt and his need to repent for his believed guilt. Leaves you wanting more...
B001RHOJSE|5.0|The author's careful and detailed analysis was and still is obviously beyond the capacity and motivation of too many people,  Hers is the type of thinking that confounds and enrages the sloganeers, and a shallow-thinking populus.  Rather than promoting the Jewish Cause, she defended the greater truth, carefully, as she was uniquely qualified to do. Her voice was too disturbing for those whose PTSD sensitivity could not endure such complexity. For the myriad of others who's sense of personal guilt and shame over the inadequecy of humanity's defense mechanisms fed loud and hypocrital protest, I have contempt.<br /><br />Sadly, ignorance and political hypocracy have continued to cultivate the killing fields and civil butchery as though each new example was just to complex to be dealt with quickly and decisively.
B001EN71CW|5.0|One of the best  shows I have ever watched, right up there with Battlestar Galactica. I watched every episode with so much enthusiasm.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I like what it does and I find the info very useful.  It also seems to be the most attractive of the various battery apps.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|A great ending to one of the best shows I have ever watched. I salute the creators of Firefly and Serenity for giving us a masterpiece ending like this.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Was not able to download. Not sure what the problem is. Love those minions! Despicable Me 1&2 were so awesome!
B000SW2F8K|5.0|Different not a typical hollywood story the combination of drama and fantasy is wonderful and cautivates the attention. I did not stop watching it for a second
B00AESN8XY|5.0|An easy to grasp concept that provides hours of fun entertainment. I highly recommend this game for anyone going on a trip or for just killing some time.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Overall this was a very good movie. I was please me with how everything flowed together. Great plot and ending!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Just last year I finally found out what Angry Birds was...then when I got my Kindle Fire decided to try some Angry Birds games. It didn't take long to me to lose interest...lose interested until I saw my siblings playing Angry Birds Star Wars. Since I didn't want to be left out I decided to download it and give it a try.<br /><br />This is the best Angry Birds games out there-especially if you are a Star Wars fan! I love the challenging levels-how they aren't too easy yet they aren't so hard you can't ever get past them (a problem I had with other Angry Birds games). While there are a few levels that I don't care for most of them were very fun and I didn't mind having to play them over and over to get 3 stars.<br /><br />Some of the extras you can get-such as the golden eggs and boba fett jetpacks were pretty hard to get-in fact there is one egg I'll probably never get. But overall it's an great, fun game!<br /><br />I recommend it to any Star Wars fan who likes Angry Birds...you'll love it!
B00275EHJQ|5.0|The movie came in perfect condition and we are getting a lot of use out of it.would recommend to buy from.
B006GWO5NE|3.0|I've used this cable for my Kindle Fire, cell phone and my sister's smart phone. This cable works great as far as charging and connecting to my laptop. I love the fact that I can use my kindle while it's charging.<br /><br />I purchased this product after the cable that came with my kindle fire-which only lasted about 3 months-stopped working...which brings me to the downside. This cable only last for about 3 months before it doesn't charge at all and I have to buy a new one.<br /><br />At first it works just fine and then after a few months I have to wiggle it to get the kindle to charge. After a while even that doesn't work. I don't know if it's my kindle or the usb cables themselves, but this is a serious flaw that Amazon needs to fix. It gets old having to replace a cable every 3 months or so.

B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Th book kept mesmerized me. I could not put it down. I cannot wait to read more of her books
B000P0J0AQ|5.0|Visually dazzling cyber adventure, full of kinetic excitement, but it retreats to formula just when it's getting interesting. This film did not bore me

B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|Loved this movie when it came out and just don't get tired of seeing it. Full of humor and good special effects.
B006S08RLU|5.0|I return to Amelie time and time again for that good feeling it imparts. This is a gem that keeps on giving from amid a plethora of movies that leave me less-than-exalted. The cast is impeccable in their support of Audrey Tatou as the eclectic narration guides me through a mosaic of mischief.
B000VIPJKM|5.0|Great story, Reese is fabulous along with respectable supporting case, and the outfits are great!  And they turned it into a musical--another great reason to watch
B000VZIOCK|5.0|This album kicks ^ss. If you're on the fence about it, don't be. Take it from me. Buy all the Queens you can. If you like crappy unoriginal music, go buy Jay Z or Bieber.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Great for studies it's just perfect it helped me out a lot in reading home work thanks for great book
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Love this game!!!  It's a wonderful challenge and keeps me busy during my husband's sports programs!  The app was free; what more can you ask?
B005LAIGQ4|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE. I CAN WATCH IT TIME AND TIME AGAIN.  IT WAS BASED ON<br /><br />THE TRUE EXPERIENCE IN ALASKA YEARS AGO.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I really have enjoyed this game.  Reminds me of the fair.  I very seldom won then so it is fun when I win the prizes.  Hope everyone tries this!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Great! Connelly does it again! Could not put the book down and finished it over three days! Definitely read it!
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Wonderful 3 generation saga of 2 families in England.  Well written and enjoyable to read.  A good trilogy and fun read.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I LOVE this game. There are several layout variations to keep you interested and entrtained and I like trying to beat my best time. As you progress, opportunities become available to increase the variety in layouts. The only thing I haven't liked is one of the layouts tends to reset to the start-up layout instead of shuffling. I have spent untold hours with this game -- and I plan to spend LOTS MORE!!!<br />Get this game!
B003U4UPHG|5.0|The show has captured the attention of my wife and me. We watch an episode every night and are always looking forward to the next night.
B008CJ0KEM|5.0|I am a huge fan of the Canadian series \\"Lost Girl\\".  I love fantasy and sci-fi and Lost Girl takes it to the next level with snappy dialogue and well developed characters as well as a great 'love is love' message and a cool vibe about acceptance all around. The setting is the unseen world of the Fae (both light and dark) and the interactions they have with humans. The protagonist is a Succubus, a Fae that feeds on human sexual energy (way to bury the lede!) This is season 1 and season 4 is just around the corner.  I hope they get renewed again.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I am never disappointed when I watch an episode. Each time I am always impressed with the sets, costumes and acting of all the characters. What a wonderful series!
B004GJ1XU2|5.0|If you're not in the right age group, you probably won't like this movie.  But it's beautifully done and captures so much about that generation.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love this game lots of fun. I have ball playing this.for a free game especially. Anybody who likes sharks will like this game
B00ECUARO8|2.0|I'm easy to entertain with most movies with people in them that I like.  Just a decent story line dialog.. doesn't have to be great to be entertained. This was a long movie that didn't develop much for me in the way of suspense. Long and pretty boring. All I can say is I finished it. MM is Mud living temporarily on an island and discovered by two young boys trying to recover an old boat washed up in the top of a tree. And that's how it begins. R. Witherspoon has a few lines that don't develop much with excitement or connect with much believability in her relationsship to Mud. I was surprised that it had a 4 star rating. Sorry I couldn't give it that.
B0009QTS1M|4.0|The regular movie was a great story, told like a legend rather than a Hollywood blockbuster.  This edition just makes the original better.
B0026O475M|5.0|We were reading the Life of Pi and wanted more input on the trials and tribulations of being lost at sea.  My students enjoyed it very much and it kept the students engaged till we finished the book and watched the Life of Pi movie
B00EI6E17A|5.0|I really enjoyed this laid-back song. At the beginning I was not so sure if I liked it, but after I while I started enjoying it. Not her best track, but a good one. However, the Music Video to it is a masterpiece.
B002TXOHIW|5.0|my sister had me buy into this so i bought it and it was in very perfect condition when i received it. the movie was amazing and i have been watching it since it has been in my possession.
B0082Z447U|4.0|This book held my interest until the last page.  Character development was very good.  I would  strongly recommend this book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Makes me want to go back in time and live another life! This show is a fantastic escape to the past!
B005MLOKXA|5.0|The only complaint I have with this show is that I wish Alicia was a more complex character.  She is so perfect--even when she is imperfect, she's good.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved this story and could personally relate to it. I did not see the movie so I cant compare.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|If you like science fiction, and have ever played a video game, this book is for you. It combines everything I like about the matrix, world of warcraft, and dungeons and dragons into a single brilliant book.<br /><br />It's rare to read a novel I would describe as perfect, and this is one of the few.
B004UID2LC|1.0|It is very slow and I barely ever use it and  I can't figure out how to sign in to my account
B007KUFDBY|5.0|Great price for one of my favorite disney films and that goes for nearly all my purchases on amazon. It came in great condition and I have already watched the film multiple times.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I highly recommend bingo blitz to all who love to play bingo games. The selection of rooms is terrific and the playing with all the extras makes it even more exciting.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|This is just another great delivery that came in a day earlier than I expected and I'm so excited to watch all these movies.
B002NN5F7A|5.0|More a theater play than a usual picture, brings interesting views of a competing world<br />A minimum of outside footing leaves the focus on actors performance, even when the ending is a bit outrageous
0345803493|4.0|I had ordered this book with the first and third.  I was glad I had done so, because when I read the first one, I was left empty and feeling badly about how the relationship had gone.  It would have cost me money to return this one, but I thought, okay, you've invested money, so read it already!  It started off where the first one ended and really took off!  The story focuses on the thawing of Christian Gray's icy exterior.  It was a much more even relationship in this story, and I think that made it a better read for me.  Really good series!
B0027MJU00|4.0|It was a very easy read and hard to put down, but I thought that the ending was dependent on too many coincidental events. After reading this book, and her latest (Gone Girl), it is clear that Gillian Flynn is a very talented writer, but she needs to work on providing her novels with more plausible endings.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love this book fun full of adventure. Recommend it to all fantasy lovers. Can't wait for the next book to come out.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is very challenging and hard to put down.  My son and I take turns playing.  We love to search for all of the cleverly hidden clues!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I personally never play so can't tell you for sure how good/bad it is. But i can tell you that my son absolutelty LOVES this game :)
0770435726|4.0|I absolutely loved this book. The protagonist is fantastic, at once a spy and a mum, with none of the silliness and all of the tension that this implies. The writing is tight, with sufficient detail to provide a strong sense of place in locales that are both familiar and unknown to the reader. American readers who have lived abroad will recognise characters and feelings of dislocation. I just don't want to provide any more detail for fear of spoiling an intricate plot - read it.
B001BANK32|5.0|I have been a &#34;Constant  Rader&#34; but this particular book stills  brings terror to ,my  hear. Patty Frtts. .<br />, .
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Same stuff over and over again.  The ending was uneventful and disappointing.  I didn't like Anastasia's incessant analysis of &#34;her fifty&#34;.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|it is a great challenge and is very  fun too. it also serves as a great brain challenge as well
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. It is very easy to play. It keeps you busy for hours.I would reccomend this to anyone.
1476733953|5.0|I stumbled across this book at my local book store having no knowledge of the previous digitally published work, and I am so thankful that my path happened to cross this gem of a novel.  It's a dystopian future novel but truly original and completely engrossing.  There were moments that I was in open-mouthed shock at events that were occurring and other times in tears.  My reaction to this work reminds me most of my reaction to the books in The Hunger Games trilogy.  The characters are so real and you feel you become a part of their struggle from the very first pages.  Juliette is the strong survivor who is at the heart of all that happens in this book but other characters like Walker, Shirly, Lukas and even hateful Bernard make up a group of people that you really care about want to see succeed.  The basis of the plot is that humanity's existence has been reduced to a few thousand people living in a 130 story silo that is almost completely underground.  The outside world is a hostile environment where the air is toxic.  People live according to a strict set of rules and must never talk about \\"the outside\\" or question the authority of the IT leaders in the silo.  Juliette is from Mechanical Services in the way down deep of the silo lowest levels.  When she is appointed sheriff, she doesn't exactly fall into their neatly organized world.  When she is arrested and accused of treason, the world inside the silo is irrevocably changed and Juliette learns the truth of the outside world.<br />You will be pulled into this story from the first chapter and despite the over 500 pages of the novel, the story still feels like it ends too soon.  I hope that the story of Juliette and the citizens of the silo isn't over.<br />I believe that this is a book that will be hailed as a classic in years to come.  It has that kind of excitement and power.  Don't miss out on this great novel.
B0033H7VI6|3.0|A really bulky knife to be carrying around as a \\"survival\\" knife. The best knife for survival is the one you have on you and you won't have this one on you everyday. This is a tool best left at camp for batoning wood or hammering into trees for whatever reason you can think of. It will stand up to a lot of abuse (I wore the coating off mostly from batoning but not much sign of rust and no other signs of failure) but it's simply too large to be a practical knife. I think the Cold Steel SRK is a pretty good size benchmark because personally it's the largest knife I can carry on my person comfortably and do work with and I'm not a small guy at 5'11 180 athletic frame. This knife is at least two inches longer and about twice as heavy. Additionally, the sheath is not as modular and convenient as a kydex type and is certainly less robust. The BIG upside to the package is the small removable pouch on the front of the knife sheath that could conveniently house a ferro rod and a small stone or a compass or whatever you need! This could be moved onto a new sheath, say you made one out of kydex or something... so that's a big score in my opinion. But this whole \\"survival\\" bandwagon needs to be derailed I think. People simply aren't using these knives and others like them for real wilderness survival because they don't do that job well (and by \\"job\\" I mean a multitude of jobs in a true survival situation). The only thing this knife does exceptionally well is split wood and even then, you have a swept blade that is not ideal for the batoning application nor is it particularly easy to sharpen; two strong marks against this knife's ability to be a \\"survival\\" knife. I think one would be much better served by a smaller knife because it is foremost easier to carry and wield. Because if you need to chop you should have brought an axe, if you devote your knife to a job it wasn't intended for you sacrifice what it WAS intended for. So by making this knife a hulking behemoth it simply undermines itself. For the price, it's a fine peice of steel but be ready to get a workout just strapping it on and you might want to consider a custom sheath option.dermines itself. For the price, it's a fine peice of steel but be ready to get a workout just strapping it on and you might want to consider a custom sheath option.
0307895505|5.0|Can't believe the author who was assigned this game to be able to play AND write step by step....amazing guide, and believe it or not an even better read...
B008QPCCQQ|5.0|All of us caught in the web of today's frantic and often mean-spirited world will welcome the sweet fresh breezes this collection of stories bring.  Salve for the soul!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is one of the best bingo game's I have found. The rounds are fun and they also have a daily free 5 rounds every day.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|I like the four stories depicting the uniqueness and difference that women experience in their lives when getting pregnant and giving birth.

B008133MDK|5.0|Definitely  a must see for fans of Sherlock Holmes.  Cumberbatch is in fine form and Freeman is an amazing, contrasting, complimentary Watson.
B0036JU6CY|5.0|Fresh take on the ninja legend. Superb action and brutal special effects. Much better than anything produced by Hollywood's aging stars lately. Rain is better than Willis, Stallone, Statham or Arnold -combined. Very good entertainment -if you like this genre!
B0041D843M|5.0|This book is life changing if you are prepared to do something about changing your lifestyle to improve your health.. After reading Chapter one I stopped eating dairy, having already given up meat this was all I needed to convince me to take the final step to veganism.<br /><br />The book clearly provides research information showing that animal protein can activate Cancer cells. It is not a light read but not difficult to understand with enlightening snippets which will certainly make you think.
159420411X|3.0|Nate Silver is a very gifted writer and his narrative reads well.  The book is a very good review of the standard ways people apply certain reasoning<br />tools, like statistics, to common problems.<br /><br />Nate was interesting because he was the only guy to get the last presidential election right--thus my interest in the read.<br /><br />He makes very good points on how \\"bias\\" can so influence one's thinking that it can make an entire analysis fall apart.<br /><br />He truly makes this point when he gets into \\"global warming\\" toward the end.  His bias is clearly liberal and it shows big time.<br /><br />Nate makes James Hanson sound like some kind of \\"seer\\" while most now regard him as a discredited crank.  And \\"the consensus\\" argument<br />for global warming has pretty well been repudiated.  So, Nate does a good job at the end of the book showing how even a great<br />forecaster can be misled by his bias.<br /><br />The reader will appreciate how Nate tries to work around the minor issue that there has just not been any global warming---kind of screws up<br />the analysis doesn't it?  Reading how he tries to position this \\"inconvenient truth\\" is very entertaining.<br /><br />Overall a very good book and it is a very good review of how to use tools to make better predictions.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game had me on my toes and. made me really have to think hard. Good game and lots of fun. Look forward for newer rooms.
B00AIA89HS|5.0|Same old sound from a great band. Love the CD. Great for hitting the gym or destroying anything you want.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|Differnt than the TV series and well written so I wonder who Castle really is... the nom du plume for ...James Patterson or one of his co writters????
B00B5JBZGS|4.0|It has it moments but gets old after a while. Great for listening to once in a while. I honestly like their other stuff. Not bad though.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|What can I say, both Season 1 & Season 2 of this series is outstanding.  I usually do not enjoy fantasy/adventure; however, this is an exception as I have enjoyed both the series and the books.
B000I9TY4G|5.0|This was Just a great movie with some of the quirkiest characters exhibitling loyalty to a captain and a space ship.

B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I purchased this set and the last Next Gen movies to replace the old VHS versions we already had.  What a nice surprise that this set had many bonus features that were a blast to watch. A must for any Trek fan . . . .
B005HSL626|5.0|The game is very easy to play. My son 7 years old, daughter  5 years old and their Grandma love to play the game.
0812983459|4.0|As others have noted the book is a little slow but it has a lot to consider - missed opportunities, relationships, living life, redemption.  The writing is wonderful and there are some great lines that I went back to reread several times.<br />\\"If we don't go mad once in a while, there's no hope.\\"<br />\\"She had given herself a challenge: every day without him, she would attempt one new thing.\\"<br />In spite of the very slow pace I really enjoyed the book.

B007HUD6OS|5.0|I have read all the Theodore Boone books and this is another great one.  It is a lot of fun for this &#34;senior&#34; to read about such a clever, industrious, sometimes sensitive teenager.  The Boone books are page turners, with unexpected twists, and turns.  You won't be disappointed.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|This book is the perfect combination of science fiction, fantasy, and a classic Cinderella story. I loved it. I recommend it to everyone.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|I am a huge fan of Bruce Willis' Die Hard franchise, but this was, for me, the weakest instalment of them all.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Season 2 is even better than expected.  It leads you through the lives, loves, hopes and wishes of the aristocracy as well as the staff.  I could not wait for each new episode to see what would happen next.  Well written and well acted.  Maggie Smith is exceptional.
B00280LYIC|4.0|It was very enthralling and I really was interested  and I underestimated how good the book was.<br />It introduced this series to me.
1616615362|5.0|Great addition to the X-wing Game. Cheaper than the Falcon to put on the table, and has better evasion. Boba Fett's ability though, meh.

B00846REIS|5.0|I WAS NEVER A READER, BUT WHEN I STARTED READING THESE BOOK, THAT COMPLETELY CHANGED. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THESE BOOKS, AND AM VERY ANXIOUS FOR THE 4TH BOOK TO BE RELEASED. I CAN HONESTLY SAY THAT THESE BOOKS ARE BETTER THAN 50 SHADES OF GREY.

B0058VW36U|4.0|This game loads fast and easy. My kids love the different levels they are working through. We give it four stars because they like temple run better.
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|Producer Dustin Hoffman did his research on opera singers and musicians from the 20s, and then brought them to life in their golden years, brought together in a country estate/assisted living home.  The performances are authentic, and well done.  What a great cast!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I am totally addicted!!  Love this show.  I have to write more than 13 words but I am a very busy mom...
B003U6BE8I|5.0|I feel this was even better than the Harry Potter movies for pre-teens. Our entire family loved it-including me (Mom) and Dad!!!

B009KS4XRO|5.0|I have played loads of bingo games but none compare to Bingo Blitz. Fast paced (sometimes to fast), enjoyable and addicting. Come and give it a whirl.
0385523394|5.0|I loved the Netflix show so I got the book. The book is excellent - a bit different from the show, but just as terrific. Totally worth reading.
B002V0929W|5.0|One of the best entomology book I ever read. I advice to read this book to anyone, who have relations with English people whether in private life or business.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I am very happy with this app. Smooth game play, nice graphics and the content is very fun. Awesome app
B001QWBM62|5.0|This product has hundreds of reviews, so I doubt this review will ever be read. Alas, when searching for just the right recorder, I didn't see a review such as this so I'm writing it because I wish I had a review like this when I got it.<br /><br />Let me begin by saying my experience with audio is very low. I'm a video guy, and I only care about audio because a video without audio is incomplete. I have been doing production for many years, but I've only ever been a backup sound man, and I'm pretty happy with that arrangement to be honest. When tasked with recording video of a live performance though, the need for recording the audio arises. When running a BFC from the sound board to the video camera for everyone to trip over isn't the best solution, enter the Zoom H4N.<br /><br />What a terrible device if that's all you need it for. It's expensive, it's noisy, it hates any input that's not mic level, and you'll never take advantage of the sweet combo XLR & 1/4\\" inputs or the phantom power it can provide (the biggest selling points to me, I'll get there...)<br /><br />If you're in my position though, a VIDEO guy, and not an AUDIO guy, it MIGHT be the perfect swiss army knife do-it-all audio solution for you, like it was for me. Without further adieu, I am just going to lay it all out and try not to bore you to death with my rambling.<br /><br />Situation: Recording from a pre-mixed source, such as a sound board during a live performance.<br /><br />In this scenario, beware the terrible shortcoming of the H4N. It's been said many times before, I'll say it again, this recorder hates line-level inputs. It seems that even on the lowest record level setting, it just can't handle the power. I am quite sure that's because there is a pre-amp that's always engaged. Fortunately for you, I've done a ton of experiments and will give you a tip right now that will make all of your confusion vanish when it comes to the strange clippiness of the H4N. If you read nothing else in this review, read this...<br /><br />****************************************<br />PRO-TIP<br />Pretend any \\"mic level\\" below 1 DOES NOT EXIST. I don't know what kind of crank the makers of the H4N were on when they decided to include these useless levels, but just don't use them, here is why.<br /><br />If you have something and it clips with the mic level set to 1 (in stereo mode, but this applied to other modes in my limited testing in those modes), it will still internally clip at a mic level below 1 *clips occur at the exact same input levels that it clips at mic level of 1*. In other words, a mic level of 1 is technically the lowest the recorder can go, but they included levels 0.1-0.9 to give the illusion of higher recording resolution than is truly possible.<br /><br />END PRO-TIP<br />****************************************<br /><br />If you want a way around this from a sound board, boy do I have an easy solution for you!<br />1) Set the mic level to 1 on the H4N (might as well go as low as you can, the pre-amps in the h4n are horribly noisy)<br />2) Use a headphone-to-headphone jack to connect the phones/monitoring port to the mic input on the H4N<br />3) Set levels using the phones volume adjustment on the soundboard.<br />4) If you still desire to monitor, you can! Just hook up your headphones to the monitoring port on the H4N.<br /><br />Issues: 1) Your sound guy wont be able to \\"solo\\" anyone, meaning listen to them outside of the mix to fine tune their sound. 2) The monitoring jack on the H4N blows, it adds a strange and extremely tinny EQ curve to the sound - almost zero bass at all, I'm guessing it peaks around 5K. Great if all you need to listen for is bad handling/environment noise in the recording. Terrible if you're a sound technician trying to get a proper sounding mix off of that thing. Also terrible if you try to do the old trick many people suggest by connecting the H4N directly to your camera's microphone jack from the monitoring port of theH4N. Really bad idea, if you want usable audio that is.<br /><br />In the end, the solution ends up being somewhat beneficial. I recommend getting the ROLLS DB24 Stereo Direct Interface or similar (suggested in a prior review, thanks!). Then (so long as you are actually recording mono like I know 99% of you who do live performances are), you can set your mic level on the H4N to 1, and independently attenuate each channel AND have the option of a ground lift on each channel.<br /><br />\\"How does that benefit me?\\" you may ask. I'm glad you asked, first by lifting the ground you can stop a ground loop hum that will often show up especially if you have the unit plugged into AC power. Further, you can attenuate each channel independently and set for example one level to average of -6db, then the other average at -12db. This means if the band gets too excited (that never happens), and blows out your recording causing it to clip, you've got your left channel to fall back on. If they are really bad about it, you could increase the separation from 6db to 12db etc. The options are endless, and in situations where you only get one shot at recording it, the ability to do this is priceless! For the 1% of you that need stereo, the same thing applies, you can get 2 DB24's and record in 4 channels.<br /><br />Situation: Recording in the field with one or more microphones plugged directly into the unit.<br /><br />The shortcomings outlined earlier all apply still, but I'd like to re-iterate a couple of points.<br />1) The pre-amp in this thing really is very noisy (try recording as close to mic level 1 as you can)<br />2) The headphone monitor port is terribly inaccurate sound wise. It's very tinny, with almost no bass and seems to peak around 5K. Not important for voice, but it is important when it comes to instruments, environment, etc.<br /><br />The good news is, there's a good dose of the good stuff too though:<br />1) Can record 4 channels at once<br />2) The built-in mics areactually half decent, but to my ear they suffer from the same strange EQ issue as the headphone monitoring does.<br />3) XLR & 1/4\\" combo jacks, along with phantom power & plug in power options, really make this guy the jack of all trades. You can basically use any mic you've got laying around.<br />4) I have complained about the quality of the headphone monitoring, but it's really not a dealbreaker at all. At least you CAN monitor your sound with this. Can't say the same with most on-camera mics.<br />5) Stamina mode is pretty decent, you just have to fully understand how it operates.<br />6) Many onboard goodies like a tuner.<br /><br />Overall, the unit is an exceptional do it all field recorder that fits my video production needs perfectly so long as I learn how to work with its shortcomings. I wouldn't recommend it to someone needing a recorder just for recording live performances. Nor would I recommend it to the person who just needs a microphone for interviews, or \\"run and gun\\" type shoots. There are far better options for those type things (aka rode videomic). With someone who has diverse needs such as mine though, this one fits the bill and makes everything \\"doable\\". I can do the contorting to fit the needs of the equipment, so long as it's cheap and the end result is quality. If this unit sold for twice as much though, I would be dissatisfied.<br /><br />Sorry for the long review, I hope at least one person found it helpful!
B00D6BU8GG|1.0|I watched the first 20 minutes and then all there was was large gray and green blocks of color with sound. And you can't get your money back. Think twice about movies from Anazon. Had same problem with HuluPlus a few times too but it's monthly fee there.
B00CS74W0C|5.0|I can not wait to read more form this author. I would love to see even more from the characters in the crossfire series.

1439297290|5.0|After reading and enjoying &#34;Pollyanna&#34; we gave it as a gift to our Granddaughter for her birthday.  Great inspirational book.  If everyone read this book and followed Pollyanna's example, the world would be a better place to live.
B000MXFPH8|2.0|Of course I had no problems with Amazon and getting it here and I had no problems with the company.  I usually don't leave any reviews but I just had leave one this time.  WARNING: This item cannot be used in the United States unless you have a converter, 120 volt to 100 volt.  In the directions it states that it is only to used in Japan and it has a warning that you can only us it on 100 volt electrical systems.  I guess if you live in Japan or anywhere that uses 100 volt electrical then no problems but if you live in the states don't waste your time.  If you really want a takoyaki maker get one form Marukai, its the only place I could find one that works in the states.  That one also has a flat top attachment for teppenyaki and okonomiyaki.
B00280LYIC|3.0|After I saw the movie I decided to read the book and I have to say the movie didn't really do the book justice. I loved all the thought out Greek myth tie ins, and its fun story line.
B009LQKHIO|2.0|I am a bit confused about this book,  perhaps it is the authors point that some women are unable to resist the volatile and controlling man.  Todd the \\"hero\\" is quick to anger (and jealous anger is no excuse, many women are hurt or worse by this type of anger), jealous of his own brother and her doctor, runs her down grabbing her in frustration or anger causing her pain.  This \\"hero\\" has one red flag after another.  For a woman who has been abused by all the men in her life one would think she would run for her life from this guy,  instead she beds him!  Are you kidding me!
B005LCYR7Y|5.0|Brilliant concept as usual and wonderful storytelling that really takes you back to the 50's and early 60's. Loved it.
1932100660|5.0|This is a fascinating book with regards to nutrition and it's effects on health.  Believable commentary on the bending of government policy to suit corporate interests.<br /><br />Eat more plants!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This device is easy to set up and use to wirelessly link my laptop to Panasonic TV to watch MP4 videos from the vastly improved Chrome browser as well as Redbox and YouTube.  My Nexus 7 (2013) also works great using this device.  The Kindle Fire HD 7 I had, not so much.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I enjoy this game quite a bit as it takes my mind away from my many daily problems. There is a good variety of layouts and levels of difficulty.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|A total different style. A fresh idea that works perfectly for this book. I would recommend this book to anyone.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|Nice to already be logged in and be able to add or access my wishlist when an item crosses my mind. Easy to use and not so convoluted as the website.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Thank you for such a great app.  I especially like the weather coming up on my KIndle in the morning.
B00003CXRM|5.0|Great movie!
B0063IH60K|3.0|I LOVE THIS GAME, BUT HATE THE POP-up at the start of each game.  Fortunately, you can skip or back page (in case of video clips) to get out.  I like the dealing option.  I usually play the Winning Deals because there is a solution and you can also compare your score with the best scores.  It seems that some of the scores were unreal that I cannot even turn the cards that fast.  I also like that if you were unable to complete the game, you can re-deal and try again. I would rate this 5 if it were not for the pop-ups.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Easy game to play.  I had never played Mahjong before, but I was actually able to finish one round completely, even though I don't fully understand the ins and outs.  I am now motivated to learn more.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|love this cd, and i love that i got a free digital download with it!  saves me the step of uploading it to my phone.
B003498SDA|3.0|Tom Cruise is a contract killer and Jamie Foxx is a taxi driver forced to drive Cruise from one assignment to the next - five in one night. Foxx realizes what Cruise is doing at the first stop when the first victim falls out an upper-story window onto his cab. At the last assignment, Foxx manages to warn and save the intended victim. In between, the film is one highly improbable event after another - including an infinite series of potential ways Foxx could have stopped this nonsense earlier.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I truly enjoy this season, but I was truly sad when Matthew died. It will be interesting to see where the show goes.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It's OK, not great.  Obviously doesn't have all the things the site has and it doesn't allow you to unfollow posts but otherwise OK. After all its really only for checking  the wall. What I don't like is that it randomly pops up with update notices when there aren't any.
B004ZGI1V0|5.0|Non-stop action from beginning to end. Hard not to be a fan of LN; he delivers. A plus is the foreign setting.

B009KS4XRO|4.0|Bingo Blitz is a fun game to play. It has some problems but the app is by far better than some other bingo apps. Try it you will love it.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I read this book shortly after the first book and could not put it down.<br />It does a good job at trying to explain the &#34;Unexplainable&#34; on how European leaders and their countrymen followers were wiling to go at war ...again 20 years after the devastation of the Great War. Since I grew up in Europe before coming to the US, I found the character and culture description of the families quite accurate and engaging.
B0052GVGYG|5.0|I saw them in concert when they opened for The Black Crows here in Raleigh. Wow was I impressed. The guitar work was fabulous, the horn section really lit up the blues numbers, and her singing set me back, way back in my chair. You want bluesy rock, get this record.
0321934946|5.0|This book pretty much answered every question I had about my DLSR. I was planning a trip and wanted to make sure I got the best use out of my camera rig, which had always been a daunting prospect. After reading this book, I couldn't wait to try out all the different recommendations and scenarios that the author worked through in language that was direct, easy-to-understand and carefully walked the line between critical technical considerations and not getting so geeked out that it would frighten mere mortal photographers. My post-reading photos are finally something I'm proud of. I'd frame them. People comment on them. And it really didn't take that much effort to get them once I had referenced this book.<br /><br />The one thing this book doesn't have that some readers might want is a detailed explanation of photography terms, science and deep technical issues, and that was fine with me. There are plenty of books for that. What Kelby does is tell you how to get a great photo, especially in the most common settings (sunsets, weddings, landscapes, sports, portraits...). The logic is simple for each and he even provides simple setups for different types of photos. I used his little laundry list of settings for some sunset shots in Hawaii and they came out absolutely stunning. I was never able to nail that before reading this book.<br /><br />Highly recommended. Once you read it and apply the concepts, you'll suddenly realize how much further you can take your pictures when you decide to move beyond a mobile phone or a point-and-shoot.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|this app is amazing it helps u in so many ways in making your pictures more beautifying and gives more live and touch to ur photo and there is so many different settings such as effects collages and much more

B0084B1T8Y|2.0|I was looking forward to this book, but actually the Mowgli story was probably the most interesting and having the biggest literary value.<br />The other stories in this collection have strange tendencies of showing that power and subjecting yourself to power is a commendable characteristics.<br />So eventually I lost the interest in reading, yet forced myself just to be acquainted with the works of this author.<br />If to be used in a class, I would recommend excerpts (some of them have lots and interesting sound and movement descriptions), otherwise analysis and discussion probably should follow...
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Finally, a program of quality and great acting.  I can hardly wait til Feb. for the next season to begin.
0399255370|5.0|This book is as much fun for grown-ups to read as for children. My daughter-in-law loves it, and my grandson thinks it's great!  The pictures are colorful and fanciful, and the letters from the crayons will keep you laughing.

B003YL4KS0|5.0|I loved reading this book. It validated every emotion I've had about my curly hair growing up, and now as an adult. I still don't love my hair, but I'm workng on accepting it, and some days, lately, I even like it a little bit.<br /><br />The book is a comprehensive guide to curly hair - how to wash and condition it, how to style it, what to look for in shampoos, conditioners and gels (plus how to make your own conditioners and sprays), and how to find a stylist who knows how to cut curly hair, which can be a very tricky thing, since in my experience, every stylist I've ever gone to said they absolutely knew how to cut curly hair, and none of them had a clue.<br /><br />The book does mention the DevaCurl line of products, but it's not an advertistment for the products, or anything. One does not have to purchase the products to get results, since the author gives the criteria for choosing shampoos and conditioners that work well for curly hair.<br /><br />I did find a salon in my area that uses the DevaCurl method for cutting curly hair, and I'm just waiting a few more weeks until my latest disastrous hair cut grows out before making an appointment.  I am very hopeful.
B00BNWWVFG|5.0|It would not be fair for me to describe this film in detail. That would be a  spoiler.<br />Some may describe Side Effects  as a thriler but I see this film as \\" THE LONG GRIFT\\". Jude Law seems to be the mark who begins to realize he is being played. How he unravels the plot against him is improbable but does make the last twenty minutes exciting with justice being served. Cathrine Zeta-Jones is wonderfully slick and as gorgeously evil as ever. R.Mara.and C.Channing  play their perspective roles so naturally you feel as if these characters.are people we know and despise in our world. The supporting cast are very convincing as friends who are just not there when you need them the most.<br />As in most grifts the mark is someone we see as deserving of being ripped off. In this film we are sympathetic and pulling for an unsuspecting nice guy.Actually a little to nice at first.<br />Do not overlook this film.Especially if you love to see if right can overcome truly devious characters.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love using everybody e for the ease of access across all of my devices.. I don't have to carry everything with me but can easily keep all of my notes with me. Easy synchronization, easy note creation, apps are easy to manage and format notes and later share with others.
B004LQGXPA|5.0|George C. Scott deserved the Oscar he received for playing Patton.  Wonderful acting.  Fascinating movie about a fascinating man.  I've read a few books about WWII, including the one by Omar Bradley, which is one of two books the movie is based on.  Unlike many &#34;based on a true story&#34; movies, this one seems to stick quite faithfully to the facts.  Patton was such a colorful character in real life, that filmmakers  didn't have to invent lots of incidents to create drama and conflict - Patton's WW II career was filled with more than enough conflict and drama to fill a feature-length movie.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I was right there wherever we went, (past - present - future) and recognized old (friends?). When I put the book down, I couldn't stop thinking about it. The most wonderfully shocking thing about the book was the absolute PERFECT ending.
B00004SYWZ|1.0|Since this is not a CD that is in distro any more, I ordered it used but excellent condition from the UK since I knew Europe would have plenty of copies unfortunately this copy was horrible every song has a hissing/ crackling sound filling the background. What a waste of cash for a great CD. Luckily I found a shop in the states on Amazon and bought it new needless to say I will be more cautious on buying used CD's but I must say of all that I have bought and it has been a lot this is a first.
B006LSZECO|4.0|actually liked it four and a half. very good read. lots of twists and turns. interesting characters and a good plot.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Read on holiday 9 weeks ago, came home stuck to the plan in the book both eating and workout solidly lost around 1lb a week of fat for my next holiday what was 8 weeks later ... however I was already smallish just wanted to cut away the excess, ive also researched more now on macros and building metabolic rate. using this books guides for food will give me great goals but how I get there will be different and also may move past those goals slower too than explained, bonus report also gives great advice in workout routines what to change where, from now I am going to bulk using the aim of the macros worked from this book but increasing slightly more controlled than explained however if no research has been done follow this book to a T and I would still make great insane gains, like he mentions it takes time!

B0092MKFIY|5.0|Ok, I'm enjoying every song on the album and wishing I had bought the CD instead of just the MP3 download so that I could share it with my husband and also listen to it in my car. Most likely, I'll end up buying it in CD form anyways! I'm a fan of Days of the New and Imagine Dragons has a different sound kind of the way Day of the New does. I think of it as kind of U2-ish with almost a touch of reggae. Bleeding out is my favorite song aside from Radioactive, so far. I've changed my ringtone, my text tone and my ringback tones to parts of the songs from this album- and that's not something I do often!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love  this  game. It Is addicting.  I have to play and I love  to win.  My friends play as well and we<br />compare accomplishments and we can share puzzle pieces when needed.  I play everyday. Thank you Bingo Blitz.

B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game and highly recommend it. It has bingo and slots. It also has multiple rooms. There is a Facebook chat option as well. I really like that you have the opportunity to earn bingo cards, lightening bolts, coins, and keys every round.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Very good series and very well produced. If you do not have any idea how they lived in the late 1800 and early 1900 in England you will find it here. Plus it is a good clean program to watch and you can see things were just like they are to day but just accure in a different style.Such as people jockeying to try and cause some one to fail at their job so they can get it. Great story that displays the way the upper crust rich tried to live,and the importance of keeping that  apperance to the public..<br /><br />Flay
0894803123|5.0|I've made three types of berry ice creams and the homemade chocolate sauce.  All were quite wonderful!  Stories entertaining as well.  Gives one confidence to make other undocumented types of ice creams.  Only wish that sorbet recipes used sugar instead of corn syrup (ice creams recipes use sugar).
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I remember reading DaVinci Code after getting so curious about all the talk going on about it at the time.  A co-worker loaned it to me if I remember correctly.  I couldn't put it down--that much I remember for sure.  The same with this once I finally found the time to read it.  Dan Brown has a way with thrillers.  This is the fourth book of his that I've read.  On to the fifth.

B008Y73XTQ|3.0|Too many fake shots (in a water tank with models) for my taste. Was nice to see a movie from the German point of view, but could have easily been an hour shorter.
B008TTPQXA|4.0|i will be brief with my review as i read this book about 2 months ago & i forget parts of it. Of course it is a facinating account of a near death experience particularly as the author comes from a scientific & medical background & would have the propensity to be extremely sceptical if he hadnt such a profound experience himself. One word of caution usually in these nde accounts we are given the impression that there is only light, love & goodness on the other side. I believe that the initial experience may be very beautiful but if you remain in the spirit world permanently then your spirit may drift to the realm where you are more comfortable based on your life on this earth whether you lead a good or evil life. Knowing that dr alexander is an altruistic man i expect that when he reaches his permanent home he will dwell in the higher realms. That may not be the case for everyone. We can rely on God's amazing grace but there is also that troubling thing called human responsibility.
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|If you are a Sci-Fi lover then you will enjoy this movie. I thought the acting was very good, the visuals and sound were excellent, and the story was good. My biggest complaint would be that I thought the story could have been expanded on and had more depth to it where we saw more of who the aliens were, more of where they came from, and more of what they were like. You really never get a sense of this and it is a little disappointing. Overall though a very good movie.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Very nice basic instruction layout with exact instructions to get you going -- well done. Could use some additional advice about fonts and other core decisions.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game has lots of good ups and few downs  good: it's cheaper than pc or iMac edition it's like xbox and is also have no bugs or lag bad:it updates very slow it's only in 7.3 and there is only a small world but it's getting better and better  i  highly recommended  it .
B0053FANS6|4.0|I did not have any problem with the packaging and the movies are great. A good price for all three
0553384775|5.0|We bought this for my brother, I lost my copy, he wanted to ready it before the movie. He enjoyed it and recommends it if you want to read up about wall-street incidents.
B00CLT31D6|4.0|Thomas J. Stanley does a phenomenal job with this book. Very informative and puts things into perspective---no need to go around and try to keep of with the Joneses. Just strive for financial independence, baby!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I'm no stranger to the subject, but I have learned something new on every page.  His research is extensive adn his fresh perspective is a welcome change.  He builds on the shoulders of geniuses and they would be proud.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Before I didn't really know what to do but now I'm like addicted me and my friend always play on it I LOVE THIS GAME BUY IT!!!
B003F46RVO|4.0|A fun, light-hearted Vampire movie.  A young Kiefer Sutherland doesn't whisper throughout and actually speaks in normal tones.  The two Corey's are innocent, good and natural, not the two troubled adults they become later on in their lives.  This is a fun movie that doesn't dwell on the who's what's or why's of being a Vampire.  It also doesn't have the gore or violence of a modern Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  Easy to like.
B0035HKWM6|1.0|I watched the movie the mask and it kept messing up. studdering and becoming inaudable.  I would rewind and then play again it would do the same thing in the same spots.  I would like to have a refund of the rental as it made it a rather unenjoyable experience.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Very fun to play! Allows for help but works your brain when you don't use it. Fun puzzles. Nice graphics.

B0097HC8MK|5.0|I have seen this movie many times and will watch it again. Truly enjoy the acting (what happened to beautiful Elizabeth Shue?) even though I am not a big fan of Nicholas Cage, this is one of his better works.

B008QTVNUI|5.0|The writers, etc, do a really good job of creating some really interesting characters.  I fear that season two will pigeon hole some of them into stereotypes, but I'm excited to find out.<br />Plus there's boobs, and everybody likes boobs

B008P1EWIM|5.0|very nice weather report app. I love the animation and custom tools. its fun to configure. I will suggest it to my friends.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I loved the story-- or the stories within the main story to be more accurate. Hosseini is a master with the pen. The book begins with a fable that, unbeknownst to us, foreshadows the upcoming events of our main characters, Pari and her family. For the first half of the story, we see how the ramifications of the choices made by Pari's father and Uncle to sell her to the Wahdati (sp?) affect everyone else. This domino effect creates all the connecting stories that we later read about. It is interesting how the same theme resonates in various ways throughout the lives of the supporting characters; loyalty and self-sacrifice vs. self-preservation and betrayal. I appreciate how Hosseini never sugar coats the destinies of the heroes and heroines in the stories. Just like in real life, things don't always end the way you want or think they should. There are ambiguities.  For example, the self-centered, self-absorbed  character, Madeleine abandons her daughter only to become a very successful actress. And yet, we can't say that it was a bad thing because her daughter ultimately became a happier and more confidant person. She was better off without her. Another example is Pari. As horrible as it was to be taken from her brother and family, she ultimately made a great life for herself in France. What would have happened to Pari had she not been sold? Would she have suffered less or more? Hosseini briefly mentions the Afgan girl photo from National Geographic and I wondered if Pari's life would have resulted in a similar destiny to the Afgan girl had she stayed with her original family.<br /><br />My only criticism of this book is that it isn't a &#34;Kindle friendly&#34; story. You can't easily turn the pages back and find your way to previous chapters to re-read who's who. Due to the stories within a story, I found myself wishing I could turn the pages back to re-read segments in a previous story when they were background characters. Other than that, this was a great read and I recommend the book.

0307476073|5.0|I could say that Cheryl Strayed's memoir \\"Wild\\" is beautifully written, perfectly paced, vividly detailed and enlighteningly deep, but I would not be saying enough.<br /><br />Rarely have I read a book that is so right on so many levels as \\"Wild.\\" And yet, this is true in spite of the fact that there seems to be almost nothing about her that I can relate to. In fact, Cheryl reveals things about herself that I usually would find repulsive, but instead I honor her for the strength to show us. I shouldn't like this book, but I do. In fact, I love this book, and Cheryl deserves the utmost praise for creating this work of art.<br /><br />When I think of what I want from a book, I realize that Wild has everything I could ever ask for. So many books disappoint on many levels, even if they entertain, provide useful information, reveal the depths of life or display beautiful sentences. I had resigned myself to accepting less and focusing on the good aspects of whatever I read. What I found most often was that something was missing. If a book had a compelling story, it would lack depth; if it had fleshed out characters, it would have a weak story; if it had beautiful writing, it had little meaning; if it were deep and meaningful, its writing was dreary and ponderous. When I chose to read Wild, I did so because it was apparently about a journey across the Pacific Crest Trail. That subject is interesting to me, and I wanted insight into what the experience might be like. I chose to read Strayed's memoir in spite of criticisms I had read saying it was too much about the author dealing with personal problems. All I hoped for was to find the book interesting and informative about the PCT, and it is that; that and much more.<br /><br />It is one of the most raw, poetic, insightful, meaningful and well written books I have ever read. I am in awe of Strayed's bold honesty and her profound discoveries about life. Her writing is impeccable to the end, revealing just the right details at a perfect pace that brings her experience to life in a way that is as deep and alive as her actual journey. As with her journey, her writing never takes a short cut because of weakness or laziness. She's given us everything here. I felt a connection to her experience without finding empathy for her choices. I could not relate to most of the things she did in her relationships because I often found that her choices and actions went against what I would do. But her blunt, yet lyrical, telling of her story led me to relax judgment and accept things as they were. In this way, the book became my own journey of discovery, leading me to conclusions similar to hers, and revealing something about what it means to be alive. When a book can do that for me, it is doing something very special.<br /><br />To those who may criticize Strayed for writing something other than what they wanted or for not doing things the way they would have, I say you are missing the heart of this book. Do not read this book for what you want it to be, but read it for what it is. If you can do that, you will discover a work of art that transcends mere story-telling, and you will know in your soul that you have experienced some part of Cheryl's journey with her and maybe discovered something about yourself, too.

B0013TXA5Y|3.0|Tires to be so much that it ends up not accomplishing much. Author great ideas and an overall amazing concept that I hope is developed further in the other books but the plot is super predictable and the characters sacrifice development at the expense of forwarding the complex, yet utterly linear plot.
B000L53D4O|5.0|Love love love!  This walker has helped my son learn to walk without much assistance, plus it has all the bright and colorful objects for him to play with.  It is durable and well made.  A friend recommended that we buy it and if glad that we did.

B00005JLEU|5.0|Breathtaking visuals and an engaging story make this a wonderful movie.<br /><br />Great for children and adults alike, this is a movie I pop in my DVD player whenever I need to cleanse my palate after yet another Hollywood feature.<br /><br />With a female lead, I would especially recommend it to parent of girls - a great movie about spiritual growth, not about stereotipical expectation of what girls should be or how should dress.

0670014893|4.0|A Delicate Truth by John LeCarré marks a return to form for one of the great espionage and intrigue writers whose recent books have been a bit disappointing.  Published fifty years after his break through novel, The Spy Who Came In From the Cold,  LeCarré's twenty-third novel remains more heavy handed than his earlier works, but overcomes the sledge hammer moral messages of his most recent endeavors.  What is more, the story, the quest and the characters are all much more compelling than he has written since Single and Single (1999).  To that end, this is a great book for anyone looking for a solid tale of government duplicity set in the modern age.<br /><br />For a full review, go to sophyanempire.wordpress.com or short link to [...]

B0034G4OXQ|5.0|This movie was so accurate about the life of a psychic that it made me laugh out loud because i could relate to it SO MUCH.  I get it.  After doing hundreds of readings for an online network for almost 8 years, I also want to scream, I DON'T DO THAT ANY MORE!!!  NO. NO!!<br /><br />People have so little appreciation for what genuine psychics do, and how vulnerable and open they must become to give the information that so often people aren't ready to hear.  What started out as a career in which I thought using my god-given talents would heal people, and bring people clarity, has turned into a mostly thankless job.<br /><br />This movie is totally accurate.<br /><br />And if you don't believe in psychics, all I can say is: WHATEVER.

B00BEIYN3M|4.0|\\"He's actually really cool, he's a drug dealer.\\" David Clark (Sudeikis) is a drug dealer who is great at his job. One night while trying to do the right thing he loses all he has. When his boss finds out he gives him a way to pay him back. All he has to do is move a \\"smidge\\" of pot across the Mexican border. Thinking that no one will stop a family in an RV he recruits a stripper, a homeless girl and a clueless boy and off they go. But it doesn't go as smooth as he expected. Comedies are the hardest to market I think. The goal of a trailer is to put enough in to make you want to see it but not give too much away. Most comedies fall into the trap of putting all the funny parts in the trailer and when you see the movie you are disappointed. While I would say that 80% of the trailers gives away all the funny parts the movie is still hilarious and very much worth seeing. Sudeikis is funny as always and Aniston is great in her role but the kid that plays Kenny really steals the movie and he is worth the price alone. There are some comedies that are funny the first time you see them then start to lose something with repeated watching. Some exceptions to me are Anchoman & Wedding Crashers. Those are funny every time I see them. While I don't think this is in the same class as those I still think it will be a long time before the humor is lost with repeated watching. Overall, very funny and very much worth seeing a few times at least. I give it a B+.
B00A285OOW|5.0|Love her books!  She never disappoints!  You feel as though you are right there with the characters!  A great read!
B00B1LN8WY|5.0|I bought this as a birthday gift for my son because it was something he said he'd enjoy owning but wouldn't be inclined to buy for himself. I was a little leery after reading some of the reviews about the quality of the DVDs themselves, but my son has already watched most of them, and they've been perfect.<br /><br />He's thoroughly enjoyed watching the series in sequential order. I must confess that I've watched many episodes, too, and it's been fun. There are also lots of extras included, and the boxed set is compact, easy to care for and carry. All the DVDs are full screen, but we don't consider that a negative; the picture and sound quality have been great.
B008JFUN6E|5.0|All Max wanted to do as a child was make a difference, but, with the depressed situation of the earth's population, that seemed impossible. The sister in the orphanage where he lived gave him hope by assuring him that he was special and that he would make a difference.<br /><br />Elysium is the satellite in the earth's orbit where the wealthy live. They have everything that money can buy: beautifully landscaped estates, computerized living, even scans that cure illnesses. Meanwhile, the population on earth lives in squalor among ruins, leading violent lives plagued with over-population, disease, and poverty. Max tries to  live a righteous life in this sad world, but it seems the odds are stacked against him. One day, while trying to fix a jammed door at the factory where he works, he is trapped inside of a compartment and poisoned with radiation. His life changes drastically.<br /><br />This is a violent and gory movie about a future time when violence would be the way of life. Although the violence is necessary for the story, this movie is not for the squeamish. Matt Damon and the other actors are amazing in this movie. The special effects are incredible and realistic. This movie puts the viewer in another world and doesn't let her go until the very end!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|What a fun show. I would recommend you it your kids to bed watching this show. They will sleep great and they will know what to do in the event of a zombie infestation.
B00BEIYMAG|3.0|Lorraine and Ed Warren are a successful couple who have researched many paranormal situations, helping people by removing haunted items possessed by ghosts or demons. The case that is shown in this movie is their case concerning the Perron Family who has moved to the country, to an old house on a large peaceful lot. The family has begun experiencing strange phenomenon in their new home and is beginning to become very frightened. They convince the Warrens to come to investigate.<br /><br />The storyline involving the Warrens is interesting and well developed, showing how their past investigations have taken a toll on them. However, the movie does not give us a lot of background to the Perron Family, leaving the audience unsympathetic towards them.<br /><br />There were many moments in the movie when the sound track things popping out at the audience make the audience jump. However, although this movie certainly kept my attention, I did not find it particularly scary. Some scenes seemed a little contrived. In addition, the movie seemed to end abruptly, without explaining all the lose ends.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fun movie. Just do not expect a lot. There is nothing new here.
B008LFY6NI|5.0|My daughter loves this app. She enjoys the fact that the picture spins while she puts the color on it.

B007EECSFA|4.0|I found the beginning confusing and superficial. I did not like the main character at all and found it difficult to understand why anyone else would. They seemed to lack basic good judgement which was not engaging. As I continued to read, the characters became more developed and enjoyable but Dolly was to remain too puzzling and manipulating to be likable so why the devotion? Thankfully, it all worked out in the end.
B0027MJU00|4.0|This book was very good, however you need to be ready for some DARK DARK places that this book goes. There were times where I didnt want to keep reading just because of how dark it was getting, but in the end it was a good book.
B00CEK9OTM|4.0|Hand eye coordination and fine motor skills are a must for this game, something I'm working on. That's why I find the game frustrating.  Just move the ball by moving the tablet, its harder than it sounds. A modern take on those pocket games from years ago when you had to seat small balls in little holes in a puzzle. Good fun
0425263908|5.0|Originally I borrowed this from the library, I was thirty two (32) pages into the book when I jumped up and ran to the local Target to get the second book because the library didn't have it. So I got it so I wouldn't have to wait to read it.  Let me tell you the best decision ever because I could read from one book to the third without waiting. And I finished this book in one day.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed meeting Eva & Gideon, they were both good, strong characters with depth and issues and flaws but with each other they absolutely made each other great and at the same time the worst people.  And OMGawd their private moments???!!! Sweet jeezus it's a fire!!  They did move with lightening fast speed but I guess when you know you know, and boy did they know.  I LUUURRRVE Gideon Cross, why yes I do!! OMgosh I know see why people love this book/series so much, and why they are always tweeting Sylvia about it.<br /><br />Eva's background story is so heartbreaking and I'm so proud of her mother for doing the best for her daughter with a tough situation, especially when she could have pretended she didn't know just to keep the money on tap/ Instead she was a good mother and *although personally I think if she had been paying attention more she would have caught it before it reached that boiling point* did what was best for Eva. It still left her with scars though and Gideon pushed all the wrong buttons when he first met her.  I wrote on goodreads \\"is it ok to like a character and still want to punch them in the face??\\" Yeah that's how Gideon made me feel when I first met him.  Gideon himself has a pretty messed up background as well but we haven't been given the full story, I'm going to have to read to find it all out.<br /><br />Imma need exes to take all the seats over there and stay out of grown folks business. Really though??*ghetto moment over*These women are doing the most especially because he isn't giving you even the slightest time of day. Just tacky.<br /><br />The attraction, the love that develops, the complications of the relationship are just so well written & amazing. Ms.Day writes in a way that draws you in & keeps you glued you just want to know what happens next and how are they going to meet the next challenge as a couple & as individuals.  Even some of the side characters are interesting and have depth, 'm looking forward to learning more about them as well.<br /><br />Reading Eva's and Gideon's journey to couple~dom has been wow, good and fraught with lots of danger **for others who tried to interrupt the reading, I'm looking at you mister man**.  Definitely a story I will be re-reading especially now that I own my own copy. Yeah I wasn't even into book two before I went online and purchased the other two for my own library. That's how good they are ok?!!<br /><br />Make sure to check back for the review of Book 2: Reflected In You.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I play Spider on my computor.  It is nice to be able to take it with me. It is entertaining.
0385493622|4.0|I wanted to learn about Fermat's Last Theorem (FLT) and its proof by Andrew Wiles.  This book presents FLT and its 350-year history in an accessible way; however, the quality of the writing could definitely be improved.  It does not give any technical detail, but covers enough material for the lay reader to appreciate the path to FLT's proof.  It is also a short story of Andrew Wiles's life as it relates to FLT and his proof of it.  It describes Wiles's passion about FLT from an early age, his doctoral research and study of elliptic curves, and his devotion to proving FLT during eight years (1986-1994) of his life.  Although the book is filled with interesting facts, the pace of events toward FLT's proof picks up only in the last third of the book.  This is where the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture is introduced followed by contributions of other mathematicians including Wiles.  I really like the author's narrative in this book, but more editing would make the book even better.
B00DH1G7DS|4.0|I enjoy Sudoku.  I think it is also a mind stimulant. I solve one in my newspaper each day.  While this is not as challenging, it is still fun and entertaining.
B00CS65QGW|5.0|Nile Rogers on Guitar?  Pharrell is a genius for thinking to use Nile here. This is one catchy record that  I love.

B0089IGUKO|3.0|Having issues with this product.  Side B plays okay but Side A sounds and looks warped. This is the second vinyl album because I thought it was an isolated issue so I requested a replacement.  But - the replacement came today and it is the same.  You can listen to side b - but out of luck with A.  Are there any good copies out there?
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Great way to while away the time! Playing this game will make hours pass quickly. Glad I finished graduate school before I downloaded this.....
B008AK8FHM|4.0|A very factual evolution from a non believer to deeply convinced believer in God and a life after death.  Alexander stacks up his years of scientific learning against his week in a coma (heaven) and his experience in heaven wins.  Having just heard a Professor of Philosophy say he would not read the book and did not believe Alexander's experience was real.  I I wish him luck in trying to convince his doctor friends.  I think it was a wonderful read and it might make people think.  There was a beautiful poem in the book that really touched me.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|It may be my competitive nature but I love this game!  Entertaining, fun, and just the right amount of challenge to keep you playing.  Even the music and sound effects are great!  P.S.  When the kids ask &#34;what are you doing mom&#34;?.........just reply &#34;a project for work&#34;!!
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|Fun read. However,  I would not gation o out and purchase any of the series of Jack Reacher novels. Action movie seems a good destination for this book.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|This backpack has a pouch for pretty much everything. but my favorite thing about it is that the estimated delivery date was between September 9th and September 19th, the backpack was delivered August 22nd
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I love the description of the pct and the entire reason for the hike but it seemed the drama was lacking in the encounters she had  with characters along the way.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|enjoyed very much very easy to read, hard to put down. 3ed book of his i have read, look forward to reading more
B003QSMCKO|4.0|This video is one of the best movies from Disney, my wife loved it and my babies loved it as well
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I never knew much about Christianity, much less the life of Jesus. Although the book is careful to explain that the biography it describes cannot be verified with perfect accuracy, this book spoke perfectly to me, assuming I knew next to nothing about Jesus. Then again, this book is written so as to explain that very few people outside of academia actually know anything about the mythical figure. While controversial to broadcast journalists, Reza Aslan's book provides convincing insight into a subject not explored by mainstream society.<br /><br />What surprised me is that this book is not just about Jesus. This book is also about the early church, the authorship of the four gospels, the political and economic environment of 1st century Palestine, and the religious practices of Jews in the time of theocracy. Aslan makes clear that all of these topics are important to any attempt to decipher the biography of Jesus of Nazareth. The gospels are a product of the environment in which they were written, just as much as the man on which they are based. Anyone who thinks that it is possible to separate Jesus from the place where he lived is mistaken--as this book shows. I do not regularly read books on theology, but this one was certainly a pleasure.
B00116FT6M|5.0|Music and actors were great! High energy movie and really fun to watch! The dancing and singing was really good. Loved John Travolta's character!
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Would recommend to anyone interested in our modern day presidents and what they contributed after holding office. No matter what your political beliefs are you come away the notion that all who hold this office are truly remarkable.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Possibly one of the best books I have read this year. I was engaged from the very beginning and couldn't get enough of the characters. Juliet is a wonderful heroine and I can't wait to see what happens to her.  The writing was very good and descriptive and the characters colorful. This would make a wonderful movie too!!!  As soon as my plane lands I'm buying the next book in the series on my Kindle!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|It's lots of fun to pass the time at home, or an airport, doctors office...anywhere..You won't be disappointed so don't wait!

B00BUAEYVK|5.0|Good movie I like the action in it....I love Bruce Willis as<br />a actor.......the movie came in good shape......Watch it you will like it.....
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|A needed historical perspective that makes no judgment of Jesus as Christ but places him in the time that defined Jesus the Nazarene. For the non believer it strips away the late attributes that defined The Christ and recognize that we live by the Christian ethic unashamedly.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Good movie I like the action in it....Bruce Willis is great actor, watch the<br />movie and you will like it....
B003WKOU0G|5.0|I loved it even more the second time I watched it. It's so interesting to experience new baby life all around the world.

B008IBP24C|5.0|Seasons 1-3.  Love the attention to detail in all areas. Very easy to feel drawn into that point in history.
B0032SQCQI|5.0|A SPOILER BE WARNED<br /><br /> this is about a man who offers someone a solution to make someone rich but the thing about it is the family actually isnt greedy  atll infact they dont have a choice in the matter  they need the money when things get worse and worse for them they push the button ... greey people are fools but THESE PEOPLE ARENT GREEDY... very hard to understand but good movie very realistic horrible though they were screwed from the ghetto more of a horror movie then a mystery and its very sad at the ending but leaves you at the end of the movie catching your once you start the movie its hard to stop watching very good movie but the kind of movie you only watch once if you are looking for one of those happy funny ending look again .. i really need to see the movie again its good gives u a very ereerie feeling
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|This is an amazing album, Slow and Heavy, just like Sabbath has always been. Those expecting Iron Man or Paranoid on every song went into this with the wrong idea. Three of the Four original members reunited for what is classick Sabbath. It's a shame that Bill Ward didn't commit but Brad Wilk fits right in fills Mr. Wards shoes without going over the top and at times you would swear you are hear Bill behind the kit. Bloody great job lads. Thanks for the Memories, Metal and Music. Long Live Rock n Roll.

0765357151|5.0|I AM LEGEND is a marvelous collection of some of Matheson's best work. The novella I AM LEGEND, was well written, dark, and bleak. I loved it! \\"Prey\\" was also a fun and terrifying read, which I believe was made into a short film. \\"Witch War\\" was interesting and the unique writing style heightened the tale. \\"Person to Person\\" was another one of my favorites, and I giggled at some parts of the story it was so dark, yet comical at times. Every story was entertaining and well done. You won't be disappointed with the rest of the stories in the collection, even if you're just buying it to read I AM LEGEND.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I think I like this series better than fifty shades.  It's such a better read.  Can't wait till the next book comes out
B000UZQI0Q|4.0|This book took a turn from the Mistborn. The book was still highly enjoyable and engaging, with a surprise ending that results in a third book!
B008EEZ64Y|4.0|This was required summer reading for my 12 year old and I decided to read too.  I was very amazed at the topics it brought up in our discussion.  My 12 year old enjoyed it as much as I did and I believe he got some serious insights.  It was very easy to read and held our interest with each chapter.
B002LC8HF0|5.0|This book reads in one way, I'm sure on purpose, and then at the end...BOOM surprise. It ties together so nicely and I was very happy with this conclusion.
1401310672|5.0|Hysterical and noteworthy. I laughed till I cried on some of them. Definitely something to buy and read and reread over and over again.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|So much better than all the normal door games out there. These are multi step puzzles that actually make sense! I love it!
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Rodriguez movie Searching for Sugar Man was so good I ordered this CD right after I watched it. If ou get a chance watch the movie. What a life story. Oh, and this CD is excellent as is the soundtrack.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|It is good looking and easy to use especially when I am watching a show when I can stand it up.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|So much more than I expected.  The movies can't do this narrative justice.  I would not suggest it for young, unmarried girls.  The themes are somewhat traumatic and disturbing, and the love story too stirring.  The abridged versions leave out key points of character and Christian growth. An excellent read for a mature and teachable mind.
B003UYUR10|5.0|I enjoy this movie. I've been looking for it for in the stores and decided to give Amazon a try. Affordable and shipping was great.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I already have this app on my mobile and now have it on my kindle. It's a good game however the downfall of it is that the energy takes too long to reload.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|This case is hard plastic but provides great protection. The rubber cover is flexible and folds easily to the back and can be secured with the elastic strap to keep it out of the way when using the Kindle Fire for reading.<br /><br />So far the elastic strap has retained its elasticity and hasn't stretched. Of course, I've only had it for two weeks but seems to be good quality.<br /><br />My only grip (as petty as it sounds); the inside of the rubber cover is a fleece like material. It picks up animal hair very easliy, BUT it provides a nice non-slip grip when holding the Kindle Fire.<br /><br />Overall, I'm VERY satisfied with it and would recommend it.
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|I have followed the quantified self industri for years now. And withings makes great products. And with the pulse they continue to break new ground and make the eco system absolutely great!
B000Y9PI9U|4.0|I must say the first song on this CD is Rehab and it just makes me so, so sad. She had already passed when I bought this CD, but I find it hard to listen too because maybe if she had gone to rehab she would still be alive?
B0020BUWX2|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. My only critique is that I felt that some of the character development wasn't as in depth as I would have liked to make the overall story more powerful. I still recommend it though!
B003C1QIO6|5.0|I love this CD it fits right into his brushfire and on and on CDs....I play these on shuffle and have hours and hours of Jack Johnson!
B004EF65QA|5.0|This movie feels so real and gritty, yet still whimsical! One of my favorites.  Great acting and some surprising plot twists, for those who haven't read the book.
B00004YRQA|5.0|I had no idea there were Japanese versions of the memory card. The one I received had only Japanese writing on it which made me a bit nervous because it may or may not work but it works perfectly fine!
B005CU5OCC|5.0|Got it for a friend who had lost a young child. I do not know what they got out of it but I Loved this movie.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing! John Green is a man of profound words and articulation. I strongly suggest this book to anyone.

B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is a place where you can make whatever you want to make. Venture down to the darkest cave. Or build a majestic castle. Because this is the biggest sandbox you'll ever set foot in. Minecraft is a place where the only limit is your imagination.<br />........................................................................................................................<br /><br />Minecraft is the coolest game. Me and my little sister play it non stop. We've built so many things you couldn't count it on two hands. From little cottages to the biggest castles. From yachts to sky scrapers. We've done it all. And so can anyone else who has an imagination like mine. And by that I mean an imagination so creative that you'll be thinking of more and more ideas by the minute and your world will soon be whatever you want to make it. Get minecraft and show everyone how creative you can really be.
B00887490Y|2.0|the movie has a good cast , but it did not very good, it was not scarry and it didi not look right

B007SYWFRM|4.0|My 7 year and I both enjoy this!!!  It is fun and easy you make progress on.  Good game for relaxing with!
B0001ARCFA|5.0|Since the mid-70s, these have been standard equipment in sound studios.  So it is no wonder they sound so great, so accurate across the entire audio spectrum.  You could spend lots more money and not find better headphones.  They are also extremely comfortable.  And at this great price it is a no brainer!  Buy them!
0425266060|4.0|Though a rip-off of 50 Shades of Grey, it was an interesting read.  Erotic, but characters were missing connection.  Still good.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|First two in this series were both great. I love Day's style of writing. You know she does her research and is a smart woman. I love love love Nikki and Damien. I have read dozens of this genre in the past 18 months and they are absolutely two of my favorite characters. I just began reading the third in this trilogy...so far, so great!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Really like this show.  I enjoyed season one just as much.  I like the flash backs and the great character development.  Plus looking at Harvey makes it even better.
B00005N6KG|4.0|Earbuds don't fit my ears for some reason, and the over the ear ones are warm.  These are wonderfully light and comfortable.  I'm not very focused on sound quality, so I think this is probably a medium quality that's good enough for me.
B004XZR63M|5.0|Entertaining and easy to understand presentation which contrasts two different attitudes to wealth building and wealth destruction. The work also references the author's other works and study courses which, no doubt, provide much more how to do it information.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Clearly the beginning of an enormous fantasy epic - if you like Sanderson and/or epic fantasy, this will be enjoyable for you!
B003QP2TYQ|1.0|The blue ray version doesn't play on all US players!  I have a PS3 and have never had issues with similar programs (some even from the same company), but this just gives a black screen.
0780619587|5.0|If you've not yet seen this film, watch it soon.  Geoffrey Rush's performance is so incredible, he should have won two Academy Awards.  Although not a pianist, he studied for months so that he could do his own &#34;pretend&#34; playing; but I defy anyone to find flaws in his keyboard technique.  You should see it, you should buy it, you should then recommend it to all your friends.  A great film!  An enduring story, timeless in its message.
B003Q6D27S|5.0|Really good thriller movie. I own all series from 1 to 6, and saw this and bought it! so exicited to put on my dvd collection. Anyways the story are pretty same but still different as other each series... but fabulous, just fabulous... good movie.

B0019IB0II|5.0|Jill Bolte Taylor's story of recovery is not only inspiring, but she also provides a practical guide of how to let go of the rigidity and story-telling of the left brain and shift to the peaceful, image-based, big-picture calmness of the right brain - what she calls a &#34;step to the right.&#34; I think I could read this book 100 times and learn something new every time.

0143124544|4.0|Brief summary and review, no spoilers.<br /><br />This novel starts out with us seeing Will Traynor as he is leaving his apartment in London after spending the night with his beautiful girlfriend.  Will is a wealthy and powerful attorney and is rushing down the street to catch a cab on a rainy morning. Tragedy strikes.<br /><br />From then on we are told the story from multiple viewpoints, most of them being from a young woman named Louisa. Louisa is nearing thirty and has just lost her job as a waitress when the restaurant she works at closes. She lives with her parents (and often her sister)  and has always lived in that tiny town and in that same house. She has a boyfriend named Patrick who becomes obsessed with fitness and running and plans to enter an IronMan type competition.<br /><br /> Lou needs to find another job and with her few qualifications and with the current unemployment rate high, she is severely limited.  At the last moment a job opens up as a caretaker of sorts for a quadriplegic man who's parents want to give him company and companionship during the day. The man is Will Traynor.<br /><br />Although at first she and the surly and resentful Will do not get along, gradually they warm up to each other and develop a caring relationship. When Lou finds out that Will wants to commit suicide, she and his family and Nathan (his nightly nursing attendant) try to figure out a way to change Will's mind.<br /><br />The problems I had with the story were its predictability and in the way the story was told in terms of point of view. I thought it was pretty easy to figure out the story early on (and this isn't any real spoiler) - lower class average  spunky eccentric girl teaches cynical rich man to care again. On the one hand I did enjoy reading the story from Lou's point of view and I did like her - but on the other hand I wish we would've had some of the story from the point of view of Will.  I thought that would've added more dimension and realism to the story - and made Will more real to me.<br /><br />This criticism aside, I still enjoyed the book and thought it was a page-turner. And I did tear up at the end, quibbles and all.tory - and made Will more real to me.<br /><br />This criticism aside, I still enjoyed the book and thought it was a page-turner. And I did tear up at the end, quibbles and all.

B00CH87HF4|4.0|awesome game! good weapons. fun bosses and enemies. I just wish there were a way to get gems easier or still be able to get them for free. but still worth a download!
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|They need to make candy crush saga available on kindle now !!  The real game not these fake ones please!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This is  a good game and fun to play on multiplayer but I need to find more crafting materials not even the black iron is common and u need black iron to convert them to the next one
B0054LJGWS|5.0|This book has to be one of the funniest books I have read in a long time. Brings back memories of 'Monty Python's Flying Circus.
6304696558|5.0|I rank it five because Goldies Hawn works very funny the realities of life. With families problems and treat reality with hope to survive and overcome any situation.
B008X9Z37A|3.0|Nothing wrong with the product, it protected my Kindle well on a few trips that I have taken since I purchased it.  The only reason that I replaced it is that I wanted one to stand up for watching videos instead of holding it.  More people are getting Kindles so I will probably find someone in my church to give it too for their new Kindle.  Again nothing wrong with this product, well made and fits well.  It's a personal preference.  Good cover if that is what you are looking for.
B00AZF131U|5.0|This is one of those rare gems that crop up very seldom these days.  You wonder how these people know each other, what is their relationship like?  A real 5 star film packed with real stars and a surprising denoument!
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|when it comes to dictionary you just can not beat Merriam-Webster.<br />When I kneed to look up a word; I find it easy to find and understand.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I am not Christian nor am I terribly knowledgeable about Jesus or Christianity beyond what I learned in school or absorb via osmosis from living in America.  But I heard Aslan being interviewed and thought the book sounded interesting, so I picked it up.  Based upon Aslan's research, it seems like the modern Christian conception of Jesus and what he preached and why, is a dramatic departure from who he actually was and what he actually believed and advocated.  Mind-blowing.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I LOVE this game!  This game is addictive...I play nightly and end up playing for hours.  You've got to try this.
8866137979|3.0|I wanted a small little notebook to use to jot down reminders and just to have for notes. It serves the purpose. It's small and has a beautiful embossed cover, however the paper quality inside is cheap. I have had other pocket Moleskine notebooks and the paper was thick. I was expecting the same for this notebook, but it feels like old school loose leaf paper. The knock off pocket notebooks have the same quality paper and are much cheaper, so it is a bit disappointing.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Just reading the back cover of this book you know you it will bring you to tears. But Mr. Green does it in a way that will make you thank him in the end. Truly a beautiful novel! Wonderfully written. I will read it over an over and over...
B008QE9XD2|5.0|I loved the movie, and the cast was outstanding !! Even bringing in Alice Cooper for entertainment. It wasn't the Dark Shadows I watched as a kid, but loved it all the same. The product arrived on time, and was in perfect shape. Trustworthy merchant !!
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This cooler does a good job keeping the processor cool. It was easy to install. I added a second fan . It only comes with one fan.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|I love this show regardless what the critic's say, and have watched it many. many times !! The condition was as good, as if I had bought it from Wal Mart, so definitely a great merchant !!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|i love thisgame. my friend melissa told me about it and i was in love. this it better than subway surfers and temple run combined. sooo awesome. and i love the movies to
B005544TRQ|5.0|The premise is a little hard to accept. However, it had me hooked by the second or third episode. The casting and writing in this series is great. Season 2 is even better.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I really enjoy thus game. Only wish more ppl would add me other than that i really enjoy it<br />Love the characters and scenes.
B001H1SVO8|4.0|This movie keeps ur interest for sure .  Humor is a bit dark, I thought it was a decent movie. Not what I expected.
B0017IKR7K|2.0|I wish I loved this CD.  I really want to love it, but it's just not touching me like Mud On The Tires.  We all have times when our performance is lacking...this one is that for Brad Paisley.  I think it's the talking on the CD...not to my liking.  That's it.  Sing to me but save the talking for live concert.<br /><br />I purchased this on Amazon and the CD arrived really fast.  I was amazed because it came all the way from Spokane.  Great job to the seller!
B005CGI4EG|5.0|Still funny and fun to watch after all these years......I am so glad I bought this as there really is not all that much to watch on TV these days or movies either.
B008YW5RH2|5.0|Pretty well put together package. A casual game that's great for killing a few minutes time. Wasn't too hard to pick up on. Running on a Kindle Fire.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Best Show on TV and anywhere period. Fun and total New York attitude. My favorite show and I recommended to the world.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Thrilling and stunningly entertaining.  I love all the relationships and how they are so entertwined.  Cannot wait for Season 4 to begin.
B00CBRH4YU|1.0|People must understand that a review is an opinion and we all know rarely do people agree.  Everyone's experience is different.  I am not an ignorant fool as some reviewers claim someone like me to be because I choose to rate this film 1 star.  I watched this movie with high hopes.  It had fantastic reviews.  Unfortunately it was not for me.  It bounced back from inspiring and boring.  I like all types of movies but this one was a complete disappointment.  I forced myself to keep watching desperate to convince myself the movie will get better and I didn't just waste $5.  I pushed forward and an hour into it I gave up wishing I had that hour of my life back to use more wisely.
B00499LTLM|5.0|I abhor the tendency these days to \\"revision\\" films etc. that have already been successfully done, so I therefore was skeptical about this show and only looked at it initially because I enjoyed Martin Freeman in the original \\"Office\\". I have to say, though,  that this is very well done and makes the transition from deerstalker cap and cape to 21st century very well. The actors are both just right for the parts, the dialogue so far excellent, smart, witty and fun. Highly recommend the show and am glad Freeman found another vehicle that highlights his talents.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It is the best show on TV.  From the pompous Lord Grantham to the dry humor of his mother, every character acts wonderfully.  The attention to detail is a wonder.  Overall--enthralling.
B00CLZ48FA|3.0|I watched the Wizard of OZ in 1938 when it first came out.  I have to imagine that the people who wrote this story were smoking something at the time.  I enjoy a good movie but I don't think that people should fool around with projects that were and are Icons.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|did not give any information for each level. Y can't u come up w/something that can help when you are stuck on a level.
B00005N6KG|1.0|These are great headphones for running... comfortable, light weight, and decent sound. The problem is that they invariably fail after 2-3 months. I've purchased many pairs of these over the years because they have been priced at a level that reflects their poor durability. Now that the price has quadrupled these headphones are not a good purchase.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so much fun and it reminds me of the early games from 80's and such. I absolutely love it.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|The more you listen the more you love it.  But the first time is a clincher.  They have a very recognizable style/sound and it is solid in this album.  Can't wait to see them live.
147089923X|5.0|Only God could have put these two men back together and wove a heart-warming story that should inspire all of us to realize that God is still in control no matter what the circumstances.
B00ABKGG0C|4.0|This story is very captivating.  Holds my attention, makes me want to read and on and on.  Recommend it very much
0761169431|5.0|This product arrived early and was exactly as described!! This was a great buy! My friend loves it! Thanks so so much!!!
B005LAII12|5.0|this is real funny.  this is about this boy makes a wish to have his stuffed teddy bear to be real and the next thing you know is ted(teddy bear) is real.  this is not for kids deals with drugs,alcohol language and sex scenes.  a must see.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|this charger works great. I love having it with me on a trip when my grandchildren need to plug in their ipads or iPods.
B000VECAC6|5.0|Most people like the second Monty Python movie which would be Monty Python and the Holy Grail (first being And Now For Something Completely Different) considering its more funny and they are right but there is a lot of laughs in the world of religion! It may offend the most popular religion out there which is variety of Christianity but its still funny!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Amazon why don't you allow a negative section on stars? I'm going to try and keep this short and sweet. This book was horrifically childish and poorly written. It was so repetitive I wanted to stab myself with a burning spork. Repeatedly. It was the most vanilla \\"erotica\\" I have EVER read. And why in the crap is it like $9 dollars? This book is basically the rantings/ravings/dreams of a bored housewife. Does it deserve the hype? No. for 1. its mainstream. 2. just no. Does it deserve a movie? GOD NO. Just....bleh I'm done. I can't handle even writing this review. I'm pretty sure this book lowered my IQ. Thanks E.L James.<br /><br />Author lady, if you're reading this...which I hope you are here's a helpful article I found on \\"the 5 biggest fiction writing mistakes (and how to fix them)\\"...im pretty sure this could help you in your endeavors. Please google it. It's by James Scott Bell.<br /><br />In fact read all of James Scott Bells books on how to write and stuff and then maybe..try again. Or not. I doubt half of us would mind either way.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|I thought the movie was cute, but predictable.  It is funny, romantic and down right silly.  Perfect for a first date movie.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|The show is just continously evolving into one of the best comedy shows on TV. I just can't get enough of the &#34;Nerd Squad&#34;!
B007FEFLTO|3.0|There have been so many books covering this era that it is difficult to come up with anything exciting. Ken found it exceptionally difficult.  I finished it because Follett is a very talented writer;he kept me picking it up.  Yet the characters are without richness.  They are Ken Follett Barbies and Kens.  And I couldn't help but notice that every female is anxious to dive into an oral activity (no- not talking) when confronted with one of his good guys.  Give me a break (or at least something credible.)
0452285186|5.0|...then this book is for you! it is just too funny, and great for the coffee table, or even a gift for a friend!
0393327655|5.0|great book everyone should read it. It puts the cork in the religion bottle.  easy reading it combines all the thoughts I have had for 70 years.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Good show, keeps u wanting to watch the next episode.Good storyline, excellent plot.  Even better when u can watch entire seasons
B001O0B702|5.0|Love the characters and the story in this movie. I do recommend you watch all the series before the movie. However, I did it backward because the movie made me want to see what led up to where all these wonderful characters lives came about.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Ok, so this is basically a story about a relationship. You see it from each person's viewpoint, or at least you think you do and then there's some twists that you might think you see coming but they unfold in a way that is still surprising and just when you think you can see what is happening next, it changes. Part mystery, part fatal attraction, part psychological thriller. I really enjoyed it. I only wish I had the book so I could loan it out. I read it on the Kindle app on my phone.
B00BB8VSXS|5.0|I generally only tolerate subtitles, but this movie is BETTER with the subtitles than with the English dubbing.  Roberto Benigni is fabulous!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|lots of good fun and a pleasant way to pass the time without getting too involved or obsessed. highly recommend if you like mystery games and puzzles
B004L79VUI|5.0|I love it -- I play it and play it and never get tired of it. A forever favorite for me!
B00CATSONE|3.0|Accidentally came across this & never realised what a hard time of it Tesla had, partially due to his naivety & belief in human kindness  in all people. JPMorgan raped him financially & Edison tried to destroy him. However he persevered with his belief in himself & brought to mankind an invention that made the world a much better place to live. Many things in this concise book I never knew, I therefore thank the author for this whetting of my appetite to learn more about these scientific pioneers.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|I thought the book was very interesting; however, I would have to disagree with a few of the concepts outlined in the read.
B0063TX06I|4.0|The brothers regrouped and found a new sound. There is some filler on the album but the outstanding tracks are worth remarkable. Who can resist Jive Talking?
B005VPRDAY|5.0|My daughter loves the pink an purple legos. I ordered these with another item and the legos still got here in 3 days. I ordered her some more of the girl legos.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is a page turner.  Gillian Flynn is a terrific writer and she kept my attention throughout the story.  I loved it and will definitely be reading more of her books.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Read in two days the best book ever the surprise was shocking never thought about it. So exited for the movie you will love this book
B004UID2LC|5.0|Did I say I love this app already ... well I do.  I was able to download allot of kids videos and play them on my tablet while on vacation with my 2yrs.  It was a life saver.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|A well made movie with a good story and satisfying ending with enough action and plot twists to be engaging start to finish.  Tom did a great job being a fix-it guy and being believable.  Great performance and interesting cinematography for the flashbacks, well done.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|Awesome knife!! Much bigger than I thought. Nice sheath and the grip is perfect. Can't wait to use it on a camping trip.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Lovely characters and great voices.  Beautiful backgrounds and the artists went over the top working on the scenery, objects and characters. The story was okay, she inadvertently turns her mother into a bear... which kind of puts you on the edge of hanging on to the story, but her true repentance is a great lesson.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|I LOVED this movie! Not much else to say besides.... Great story.... Good acting and excellent action sequences..... Good job J. J. Abrams
0920668364|5.0|My son is about to get married and he told me he would love me forever, just like in the book.  Great way to explain about how we grow and age and eventually the kids take care of their aging parents, and gives them a good model. I'm glad he feels it's important that he takes care of me now that he's grown.  I think this book should be in every home in the world.
B000AQBAUI|4.0|Band sounds like Led Zepplin, goof groove going on way back then. If you like early 70's rock/blues, go for it.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|The Vickings... makes me know the modern man would not survive 30 days back then. I like the action and loyalty to family in the series. I'm ready for season 2
B003L77G6A|5.0|This season was even better than season three!  Really enjoyed it.  I can see the growth in the different characters and the bonding between them.  Wish I could afford season 5 already.
0425263924|5.0|Man, oh man!!! This series is gonna kill me. I can't stand waiting. Even though I'm sure the next one will bring its fair share of problems, I'm hoping it will be about their marriage and how they handle things as a married couple and no more break ups and splits and separations. I can't wait to see what happens next and read about their HEA!!! It's gotta be coming. RIGHT!?!?!? ;-)
B0060V1WJ6|3.0|I fell asleep watching this... It was slow and not as funny as I expected... Apparently I didnt miss much during my 30 min nap in the middle of the movie....
B00BTHV05M|5.0|The entire album is fantastic and every song is catchy and will have you humming the tunes all day long!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love the big display and ease of use.  Beats pulling out a calculator when I already have my Kindle out.
B004EWFUQY|2.0|Disapointing<br /><br />full of obvious remarks - pretty much like Atkins or Scarsdale. Does not merit to spend time on it. Probably it works
B004LWZW9C|4.0|This is a good product in that the movie isn't scratched and the box is solid. However, the covers of the box are scratched, making it look old and unkempt.
B001O1O71C|4.0|What a great book. We, as the people on Brunos side of the fence , could never have imagined the pain the Jews went through.
B00498YZH8|5.0|This product is just as described. The box is not broken or scratched. The dvd isn't either. Great movie too.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I was a  fan of the stage production and the movie version and now can watch it whenever I want.
B005LAIGSM|5.0|This product is just as described and I have no complaints. The digital copy makes it even better for the same price or sometimes less than a simple DVD version. Cute movie too.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This has been a great way for me to workout everyday and it doesn't interfere with my regular daily life. Only a 20 minute workout is just perfect and a effective way to see results fast and not get bored with the routine!! Loving it!!
B000PUV1ZI|5.0|This movie is still fun. I watched it with my 10 year old son, and he was &#34;Hooked.&#34; This is now among the  &#34;can we watch that again&#34; movies to which we have access.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|well written scripts, it has to be fun to make these shows - love it  and I still watch the earlier ones.. ...
B0064MGU98|5.0|Woman done wrong by yet another cheating husband who dusts herself off and carries on for her family and herself.  Typical story but intriguing and well written storyline.  I recommend it for anyone who likes to see revenge with class.
B009G41CG2|2.0|The printing is to small. To hard to read....I really have to concentrate to find a pair. This is the only game that I have had problems with.,
1449410243|5.0|Funny. Very funny. If you have a cat then you need this book. It can save your life! (Not really, but it is funny.)
B00CWY76CC|2.0|I can't figure this one out, The instructions only explain escape..... How do you escape out of the room??? It might of been fun.
B000NA28I4|4.0|A fun story, well told.<br />We had watched it before and the DVD was watched several times but after the third of fourth time it started loosing some of its magic.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I love this app.  I use it all the time to buy and sell and have no problems using it.  It makes it easy to receive payments as well as make them and to bid on items.  It displays them in a nice list so they are easy to see and scroll through.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is the perfect game because it has no energy limits, constantly refills coin to harvest so its fast &amp; easy to rack up coins to spend, &amp; gives out acorns (the &quot;cash&quot; you usually have to shell out cash to acquire) generously within game play. its as if the developers want you to actually play it a lot! and have fun not frustration at being shut off! in Ice Age Village you get to play and play to your hearts content and theres always coin to pluck.<br /><br />Whether you're a huge Ice Age fan or not,  the ice world scenery is enchanting, the characters are adorable &amp; the narrative is humorous patter compared to the usual business letter.  Its basically a zoo game, where you place an animal then add his mate. Hatch two babies to finish a family then its complete.  This is top notch game development, free and endless.  Its so cute it makes you want to stay in.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game<br />It was very fun and challenging can't wait for more levels and more puzzles. I really love these kind of games
B0091LS07E|4.0|love it, most of the songs are great, few I don't care for.  but that is all personal choice.  a good buy.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Really fun game.  It never gets old.  And all the funny characters are great.  You should definitely get it. GET IT! GET IT!GET IT!
B00957T6X6|5.0|This is a great series.  Very well written.  The character development is very good.  The author spends quite a bit of time also setting the scene with descriptions of the landscape but not over doing it.  You have to pay attention as there are lots of names to remember and places, but if you do it is well worth it.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|My grandson could hardly wait for the package to arrive. He was able to put it together with little help from me.<br />He has enjoyed playing with it ever since he got it.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Wow! this HDMI stick is really nice to use for streaming stuff like Netflix and Youtube. If you use Chrome on your Mac or PC, you can do more things than people who use it to streaming stuffs for their smartphones. Google should do some more stuff to it to make it even better such as, the ability to mirror for phone, more apps, and customizable wallpaper of course.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Great game!! Only downside is paying for different things in the game, never believe a game when it says it's free.
B005LAIH2M|5.0|When I first saw the trailer for this movie the premise made me groan out loud.  An action movie about Hansel and Gretel?  Hollywood was scraping the barrel more than usual.<br /><br />We decided to rent it one night to see just how ridiculous it was and my opinion was quickly swayed, especially after the first fight scene.  Wirkola apes Raimi almost perfectly, from the quick-cut zooms as they're gearing up to the slapstick manner he choreographs the fight scenes.<br /><br />The varied design of the witches and the over the top comic violence were enjoyable as well.<br /><br />This movie definitely isn't for everyone, but for those that enjoy Raimi's brand of comedic horror I think you'll find something hilarious and fun in this movie.
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|Well acted, intense political drama.  As you watch the series progress, you are drawn in to each character and his or her story. The political intrigue and manipulation is chilling and you hope that this is not really like it is in our Government but you are also afraid that it is!  Highly recommend!!
B00C1TOTK0|5.0|Frankly speaking, I hadn't have that much expectation when I first ordered this blu ray even I have this on DVD<br />But Wow, It seems that they really seriously well remastered on blu ray which even made me recognize the quality<br />of this title newly.<br />Beautiful clear color with full of natural back ground with rich expression of the actors ...<br />For me, it's a collection.[[ASIN:B00C1TOTK0 Shane [Blu-ray]]]
B002LVVCQM|5.0|A very interesting out look..... something for everyone to think about. No one knows for sure how life really started though.
B00008G7UF|5.0|I admit it  - I'm a worse mush than when I was young.  Meg - is always Meg, but good at what she does.  (ex: \\"when Harry met Sally\\" except I Despise what's his face).  Kevin pretty much curls my toes...So Engaging in \\"A Fish Called Wanda.  Was he a Frenchman then too?  Last, but way, way not least - anything w/a Van Morrison song in it cannot be faulted.  Knew instantly it was him when I heard \\"Someone Like You\\".  Have his \\"Astral Weeks\\" LP album from long ago & far away...
B0098A70Y2|2.0|It looks and sounds very different from Baby TV on youtube. I would not recommend it. It does not have the beautiful colors.
B0098460O4|4.0|Good blend of voices. Perfect opera voice of Jonathan. What a voice at a young age! Will enjoy this in the years to come.
B0054SMID0|3.0|The ending was totally different than the book, but good nonetheless. As usual, many of the details that make the book better have to be left out.
B00BQQM262|5.0|Hands down one of Disney's most well put together movies. Excellent use of quick witted humor for both adults and children
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|The first 4 or 5 were a bit off the usual excitement that we have grown to expect, but then BOOM, it is all uphill from there. Then, the final episode is full of surprises, which is not the usual and customary. I cannot wait for Season 9 to start!!!!  Happy viewing all!
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|First off this is a review for the box set and not a critique on the movies themselves.  Bought this to have it in my collection and I am quite pleased with the addition. Speedy delivery and awesome box. Nuff said.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Loved the game! It was very addicting and i finished the game in one day. The hidden object games were fun and detailed.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I don't think this was desigbed to let you finish the free daily. Tournament. I have 50 Jewels of Gerousity.yet. for two months working on the last two needed things I get nothing. I am frustrated with the game. I still love playing it but it seems like it is always dangling that carrot in front of you.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Its so much fun that its hard to quit playing the game once you start. Its very entertaining and enjoyable to play.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Very addictive.lots of fun and playing for fun.get lots of new friends on Facebook so come and enjoy it<br />play it today
B009NF54ZE|5.0|This was an excellent sequel. Lush graphics accentuate the story line, which is a bit long winded, but well worth it. The puzzles are fun but, not too challenging. I found myself seeing how fast I could complete them just for an extra challenge. My fastest time was 7 seconds on the puzzle where you have to find all the flowers near the end of the game. I also appreciate the fact that when you do use a hint it shows you the next item on the list as opposed to a random item, because I am a bit OCD and have to find the items in order. lol. I play on Kindle Fire 1.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Great game. It's addictive and fun. I get bummed out when I run out of bingo credits though and have to wait 24 hours to receive free credits.
B00A80SHFM|2.0|First of all my biggest disappointment is that the song 'Do you Hear the People Sing' is not included on this soundtrack! It is the basis of the entire plot and one of the most powerful moments of the film and it is not deemed important enough to be on this highlights? This movie adaptation of the musical failed in regards to the musical performances. There are some good songs such as 'Master of the House' which I regard as the best version of the song, but most are not up to par with the 25th and 10th anniversary additions. While I understand that Hollywood wanted to get big name actors to play these roles, many of them simply do not have the vocals to back up the characters in this iconic musical. I was sorely disappointed in the performances of Amanda Seyfried, Eddie Redmayne, Russell Crowe, and especially Anne Hathaway. I wish I would have previewed the album before purchasing it, because I would have instead purchased the 10th anniversary edition. If you really love the songs for Les Miserables I would instead consider purchasing one of the Broadway versions.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I loved it.  Made it a marathon. Couldn't stop watching.  I love the costumes and decor from this era.  Classic
B00BI73CVI|3.0|Les Mis is my favorite musical, so when I found out they were finally doing a big Hollywood production I was so excited to see it--especially after finding out who the cast members were. I was definitely disappointed. The movie is not bad, but once you have seen the stage show the singing just does not compare. Many of the cast members may be big names in Hollywood, but they do not have the voice to support the role in this movie. Anne Hathaway's I Dreamed a Dreamed was very disappointing as were the songs sung by Amanda Seyfried and even Empty Chairs and Empty Tables sung by Eddie Redmayne at the end were not quite up to par. There were some good songs. I felt this was the best version of 'Master of the House' I have heard and Hugh Jackman's vocals were surprisingly good. This movie felt like it was much longer than it actually is. They dragged on parts far too long to keep the audience interested (especially the ending).  This movie is not terrible, but I will not be purchasing it and instead will continue to go see the show live and listen to the 10th anniversary soundtrack instead.
B007WPM7SO|4.0|This was a romantic movie.  Could have had less war gore but the story line was good.  The ending made me wanting to know what the future would bring for the main character.
B009JZPH32|3.0|This movie was ok. Some parts were better than others but it could have been 45 minutes shorter and it probably would have been better. Kinda long and drawn out.
B00BYOEZTI|1.0|Part 1 of 3 yet!<br />More sweeping vistas.<br />More sweeping music.<br />More crying Hobbits.<br />More stuff that didn't really occur in the book.<br />A great children's book ground up for adult consumption.<br />Warning: do not let your children see this. Have them read the book.
0894803123|5.0|Love this book! Bought it when I got my White Mountain electric ice cream maker last month & have LOVED every recipe in it.  The book is fun, which is appropriate to the subject matter, but gives excellent instruction to make no fail, delicious ice cream every time. I love it that it calls for raw eggs because I have organically fed, free range, heritage breed chickens on my farm and I'd eat their eggs raw any day - if I had to get eggs from the grocery store (health food stores included, excluding ones from local farms) I'd never eat eggs cooked or raw! So those of you worried about eating raw eggs, go to your local farm & quit worrying and start enjoying these awesome recipes - yum!
B00AHJL7BK|4.0|It is a fun brain test.  Wish the toggle for the numbers was closer to the number pad.  Seem to reach back and forth a bit during a game. It could also use a description of the scoring system. But these are just nit picks.

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|This is good for future generations. Our grandparents or parents who were in this war never spoke of it and there was PTSD but no one knew what it was. Previous generations would say to &#34;buck up and go on like a brave man&#34; type of sayings. This makes you understand our young men and women who want to fight for our country. Patriotism was so evident during this war. It was very emotional for me. I think of my dad who went to Korea but wanted to join the 442nd Battalion. He was too young for WWII. He was thinking the same thing.....fight for America.

B004J4XGN6|5.0|The mindset and process for building a lasting, successful business that is presented in this book is absolutely vital to anybody starting or thinking of starting a new company.  Throughout the easy-to-read book you can almost feel Eric pouring his soul out as he pulls deep lessons from his entrepreneurial experiences.  His bringing in stories of other companies also gives credit to his message and provides us with different angles of seeing the same message.  Such an easy book to read and you won't be able to put it down.
0891419063|5.0|This was the first book I read about the actual battles in WWII Pacific. I felt for all the Marines and feared for them as I read. It was very emotional for me. I didn't realize how different it was compared to the European war. This is good reading and should be passed along to future generations to understand what our grandparents/parents went through as young men.

B0014D6PCO|4.0|Compared to the preceding attempts at Batman movies, this one was superior.  I would recommend it for the older crowd.  It's a pretty dark and serious movie but very well done.
0142000655|4.0|I read within a variety of genres, and while my tastes have lately leaned toward modern popular fiction, I recently re-discovered this book. Much to my surprise, it has held up as well as ever. I'd originally read it in high school and enjoyed it. Still do. It's a deftly told story, and one that has stayed with me all these years. It was even more delightful to read it a second time around. Masterful storytelling... but then again, this is Steinbeck we're talking about!  Great book.

B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Amazon asked me to rate the first season of Doctor Who, which for Whovians is a little like getting an email that says, &#34;How many stars would you give Christmas?&#34; Just as Christmas is something you think about and look forward to and then sometimes it's amazing and dreamy and perfect and sometimes it's meh, okay, socks and underwear, it's still That Thing that you still totally love and think about and anticipate. Doctor Who Season 1 is like Christmas when you were too little to really get it but still, chocolate and presents? What? Okay! David Tennant Doctor Who is like when you're old enough to be hoping for that Red Ryder Carbine-Action Two-Hundred-Shot Range Model Air Rifle. And then for me, the Matt Smith Doctor Who is the sweater that lights up from your crazy aunt. Still, Doctor Who! So, yeah, five stars easy.

B00555X8OA|1.0|I purchased this book as part of a company book club.  The detailed content and repetitive descriptions made this a slow trudge.  The author belabors each point in almost a distracting way, though does do a nice job providing relevant examples at the end of each section.  The core of the content is very helpful for personal growth and interpersonal relationships.  Unfortunately the lessons get lost in thick verbage, which is ironic since the author cites a quote stating that (paraphrasing) describing a subject in difficult language is a sign of not knowing what you're talking about.

B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Most of this book is pretty informative. I don't know if I buy exactly the extent of the discord between Paul, and the Church James was leading. No doubt there was some discord, but I hardly think Paul was referring to James and those sent by him as the Satans. They viewed each other on the same side for the most part.<br /><br />Paul was trying to bring a Jewish religion to a Greek audience. Many of the concepts were foreign: the nature of God, need for a messiah, sacrifice for forgiveness of sins (though now fulfilled in the messiah, instead of at the temple), redemption and resurrection of the dead, etc... The Nicolaitans for instance used forgiveness of sins to justify immorality, as well as probably other detestable behavior. It think most the discord was against people like this.<br /><br />He makes a few too many presuppositions about Christ. I think Christ was more educated about the scriptures than the author believes, though I agree many of his followers were not. Paul, unlike many of Christ's followers, was a pharisee and very well educated in Jewish scripture.<br /><br />Paul knew a lot more about the messianic traditions than many of Christ's followers in Jerusalem (or even we do now, much has been lost). Pauls view of Christ would have been mostly from writings of the prophets and such, while those in Jerusalem's would have been mostly from following and listening to Christ.<br /><br />So you have a learned teacher, a rabbi, teaching mostly the poor and uneducated. They listen but obviously don't always grasp the message he is sending. They declare him messiah so he assumes that position, not because it is his will, but because it has been declared to him by his father in heaven, and confirmed by his followers, and thus it is Gods will. He ends up on the cross, but his church of the poor continues after his death.<br /><br />Then you have Saul of Tarsis, an educated and well to do Pharisee; who never walked with Christ, but through a divine experience,is convinced that Christ is not a false messiah. He learns a bit from one who was taught by Christ, and then becomes Paul the evangelist. Bringing into the Church more of the scriptural views on the messiah. I will say though, much of the historical context seems very accurately laid out.<br /><br />I do wish he had used a different title other than Zealot. As most people identify zealot with the assassins, who eventually ended up in Masada. Or those who guarded Jerusalem's walls and gates, stabbing any who tried to escape the city. That said, at least he does a good job of explaining what he means by zealot.<br /><br />I would also like to recommend reading this book:<br />Jesus: Zealous Savior of the World - Some Answers for Reza Aslan<br />[[ASIN:B00EI43B5A B00EI43B5A]]<br /><br />It is fairly short comparatively. It points out some alternative views, possible oversights, and a few mistakes in Aslan's book. Aslan makes too many presuppositions, some of them I think unfounded. But he also makes many very good points, and I learned a few things from him. And he does a good job of placing Christ and his disciples in their time, among their contemporaries, and in their sociopolitical landscape.

B004UQPM4E|5.0|***NOTE: This massive review was originally posted in 2012 on another version of this product (pre-Man of Steel). Due to a Amazon glitch, that page was deleted and all helpful votes lost. Here is the original review in its entirety.***<br /><br />Amazon really needs to stop blending all of the disparate reviews for one movie together. It's very easy to get confused as to which set has what features, etc. In this case, however, it worked out rather well for me, price-wise.<br /><br />This Blu Ray set is NOT the four-film \\"Complete Superman Collection\\" which was released on DVD and contained bare-bones editions of \\"Superman\\" I through IV, nor is it the \\"Christopher Reeve Superman Collection\\" which contained special editions of the original four films. No, this is the \\"Superman Motion Picture Anthology\\" (which was known as \\"The Ultimate Superman Collection\\" on DVD), the massive eight-disc deluxe set which contains \\"Superman\\" I (expanded and original theatrical versions) through IV, the Donner Cut of \\"Superman II\\", and \\"Superman Returns\\" complete with the original opening, a newer transfer and a slew of bonus features. This version of the product (the version I received, anyway) was from the UK, but that doesn't really matter since Warner Bros. does not region lock their Blu Ray releases (hence the \\"Region Free\\" in the item's description) and this set is identical to the US version. Amazon lists this set for sale under the correct title of the Anthology as well as under the incorrect moniker of \\"The Complete Superman Collection\\". Buying this set under this incorrect name saved me about thirty dollars over the properly titled one, so budget hunters take advantage! Now, let's go through these one at a time:<br /><br />SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE - The first big-budget superhero film and, in many ways, still the best of them. Richard Donner and Tom Mankiewicz set the template for every other superhero origin movie that has come since. And Christopher Reeve, of course, is still theultimate film superhero. \\"Superman: The Movie\\" proved that comic books could be translated to a different medium and be taken seriously, if treated seriously.<br /><br />The first two discs in this set are devoted to the expanded and original theatrical editions of \\"Superman: The Movie\\". I like the expanded version of the film just fine, but I grew up on the original version, so I prefer that one. It just seems to move better, and doesn't introduce a lot of head-scratchers like Lois Lane being the little girl on the train in Smallville who witnesses a young Clark running along at super speed (how old are her parents, anyway?). The transfer on this version is a fair bit better than the old Blu Ray release, which I also owned and did not include the theatrical version. There seems to have been more work done on the expanded version's transfer than the theatrical version; there's not so much excessive grain and the colors really \\"pop\\" on my 51-inch. However, there's not a huge difference overall (the picture on a 30+ year-old film that was a bit soft in parts to begin with is only going to look so good), not enough to make me stop watching the version I love. Sound has been redone in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, and it really makes a difference to my ears over the old disc, which was given a plain Dolby Digital 5.1 surround track. Just listen to that subwoofer rumble in the opening scenes flying over Krypton. Whoo!! Bonus features are all ported over from the four-disc DVD edition, including the early George Reeves feature, \\"Superman Vs. The Mole Men\\"; none are in hi-def.<br /><br />SUPERMAN II (theatrical)/SUPERMAN II: THE DONNER CUT - Boy, the comments one could make about this debacle. In the interest of saving time, I'll just cut right to it: neither one of these movies is truly on the level of the first film. I love them (both versions), but it's a fact. With the first movie, you got to see Richard Donner's vision of the character completely realized. But then, of course, the Salkinds got cold feet and dumped Donner (after he had already completed most of the shooting on \\"Superman II\\", including Marlon Brando's and Gene Hackman's scenes) and brought in Richard Lester to reshape and complete the film. The theatrical version of \\"Superman II\\" still works well, expanding on the character and mythology of Superman while keeping the action quotient high. The cast is still great and Terence Stamp creates one of the all-time great villains in General Zod. Richard Lester just added a little too much goofy humor for my taste (dude blowing backwards on roller skates, etc.), something that would run rampant in \\"Superman III\\". Also, there's a certain affection for the characters that is missing from the final product; it all seems a bit workmanlike. And don't get me started on the producers eliminating Brando's footage just to save a few bucks after the first film had already made millions of dollars at the box office. Everything that was good about \\"Superman II\\" seems to have been sourced from what Donner and Mankiewicz had already planned beforehand.<br /><br />In 2006, after years and years of fan petitions and requests (a few of which I signed, I will admit), the missing footage from Donner's planned version of \\"Superman II\\" (including the Brando scenes, which help this version improve immeasurably on the theatrical cut) was found, restored, re-edited and released using John Williams' original music from the first movie. Watching the Donner Cut, you immediately notice how much more he loves these characters, how the movie just feels right in a way that the theatrical version did not. The replacement of the theatrical version's opening action setpiece at the Eiffel Tower is a prime example. Donner's opener, in which Lois jumps out of a window at the Daily Planet in hopes of forcing Clark to reveal himself as Superman and save her, immediately shows the big differences between the two versions: the plot does not drive the characters in the Donner Cut, the characters drive the plot. The Kryptonian villains are treated more seriously and possess real menace (see the scene where they storm the White House). The Donner Cut also benefits from the restoration of the luminous footage shot by the late, great Geoffrey Unsworth, whose work on the sequel was mostly lost to Lester's harshly lit reshoots. There were certain scenes between Lois and Clark where she confronts him over his dual identity that Richard Donner planned to shoot but did not have the chance, so screen test footage was substituted. And that's where it hit me. Therein lay the problem with the Donner Cut: it's not actually Richard Donner's \\"Superman II.\\" It's as close as one can actually get to what could have been the best superhero film of all time in \\"Superman II\\", but that film does not exist, will never exist. All we have, thanks to the producers' greed and shortsightedness, is a reasonable facsimile with substituted footage and a rehashed ending (Donner and company never got to think up a new ending for \\"Superman II\\" after using its big turning-back-time climax for the first movie). Lest anybody think I'm just piling the blame on the Salkinds (though they totally deserve most of it), Donner and the driving force behind the project, filmmaker Michael Thau, shoot themselves in the feet by refusing to touch ANY of the Lester footage except where absolutely necessary, which gives rise to some mediocre line readings and bad dubs which were actually improved upon in Lester's theatrical cut (the scene where Superman challenges Zod to a fight at the Daily Planet springs to mind). I can understand Donner's feelings about the project, but a little compromise in this case might have gone a long way. As it is, the Donner Cut is now my preferred version of Superman II, but not by as huge a margin as I might have thought.<br /><br />Discs 3 and 4 are devoted to the two \\"Superman II\\"s. The transfer on the Donner Cut seems to be the same as the original Blu Ray release, which was pretty good. The theatrical cut of \\"Superman II\\" (which I've never seen on Blu Ray) fares pretty well and, like the Donner Cut, seems sharper than the first film. Again, the main difference is in the DTS-HD MA sound, which is fuller and more robust than the previously available Dolby Digital 5.1 track. All bonus features were ported over from the two-disc DVD of the theatrical cut and the previously released Donner Cut, respectively. All of the Fleischer/Famous Studios cartoons can be found on these two discs, with the first nine 'toons on Disc 3 and the second batch on Disc 4.<br /><br />SUPERMAN III/SUPERMAN IV: THE QUEST FOR PEACE - And here come the sad parts. \\"Superman III\\" was the first film where Richard Lester had control of the production from beginning to end, and boy can you tell. Overly slapstick-y, negligent of the main characters (poor Margot Kidder is on and off screen in two minutes flat), and worst of all, BORING. How do you make a Superman film BORING?! The only person who comes out of the thing with any dignity at all is, again, Christopher Reeve, who really sells the duality of Superman's character here (including a scene where \\"dark\\" Superman literally fights Clark Kent in a junkyard). About Richard Pryor, whom I have admired since I was a little kid, I can only say this: as a film actor, he was a terrific stand-up comedian. The only other useful thing to come out of this movie was the computer fraud plot device later referenced in \\"Office Space\\".<br /><br />Full disclosure: when I was a kid, the only Superman movie we had on VHS was \\"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace\\" (God, I know, I know). I heard my dad talking about how terrible it was, but I was a kid and I figured what the heck, it's Superman! So, for a number of years, I had a hard time thinking that it's as bad as everyone says it is. Well, it is, it's terrible. But not as terrible as how Warner Brothers treated Christopher Reeve and the film. \\"Superman IV\\" was originally supposed to be a big-budget return to form for the franchise. Christopher Reeve came up with an engaging original story (the wisdom of Superman interfering in real-world nuclear politics notwithstanding) and the original cast, including Gene Hackman, would reunite to erase the lingering bad memory of \\"Superman III\\". Then Warner Brothers slashed the budget and script and shifted the property over to Golan-Globus/Cannon, purveyors of countless '80s cheesefests such as Chuck Norris' \\"Missing in Action\\" series and \\"American Ninja\\", and the rest is ignominious film history. Sadly, this would be Reeve's final take on the iconic character of Superman and, needless to say, it's not how his portrayal should be remembered.<br /><br />Discs 5 and 6 are devoted to these two masterpieces, and they receive better audio/visual treatment than they probably deserve. \\"Superman IV\\" in particular looks crisp on Blu, all the better to see the cheesy matte lines and wires. Both have DTS-HD MA tracks; \\"Superman III\\" receives a 5.1 track while \\"Superman IV\\" is relegated to plain 2.0 stereo. Bonus features of interest include a commentary by co-writer Mark Rosenthal and a bunch of deleted scenes on \\"Superman IV\\" (ported over from the Deluxe Edition DVD released a few years ago). They're not great, but at least they help to make sense of and flesh out the plot, such as it is.<br /><br />SUPERMAN RETURNS - Everybody seems to have a different take on this installment, Bryan Singer's homage to/continuation of the original Donner films. Some thought it was too reverent of the original, that Superman was too \\"emo\\" and that there was not enough action. I personally liked the film, although I think there is probably some validity to those criticisms. I still feel that Brandon Routh was a bit too young to properly portray a more seasoned Superman who has gone through the events of the first two Donner films, but he was pretty engaging in the role, handled the emotional aspects of the role with skill (which, to answer the \\"too emo\\" critics, OF COURSE Superman is going to be emotional with everything going on in this film, he's not some soulless robot) and generally acquitted himself very well in inevitable comparisons with Christopher Reeve. Kevin Spacey almost makes you forget Gene Hackman's version of Lex Luthor, edging closer to the malice and insanity of the original character in the comics. James Marsden (who jumped ship on the \\"X-Men\\" franchise with Singer for \\"Returns\\") does a good job as Lois' boyfriend, a guy who could believably rival Superman for Lois' affections. Probably the only weak link was Kate Bosworth as a bland, rail-thin Lois Lane who fails in every way to measure up to Margot Kidder's take on the character.<br /><br />Disc 7 is solely devoted to \\"Superman Returns\\", and it improves on the original Blu Ray in nearly every way. The transfer on the original disc (one of Warner Bros.' earliest forays into Blu Ray) was, to put it mildly, a little drab. Well, not so on this new transfer! We're talking reference quality here, it's that good. Every color pops and every detail shows; you can see the weave of Lex Luthor's crisp white suits, you can see the fine mesh of Superman's costume and the crinkles in the leather of his boots (and you can also see just how suspect the CGI Superman is during the shuttle rescue). But for once, the DTS-HD MA sound falls a bit short of what was already available on the previous \\"Superman Returns\\" Blu Ray: a lossless 5.1 PCM audio track. Audiophiles and collectors might want to hold on to their copies for that. Bonus features have been ported over from the original Special Edition DVD release, including a feature length documentary on all aspects of the making of the film. But even better (and probably one of the major reasons I bought this set), we get to see the original fully produced five-minute opener of \\"Superman Returns\\" in which Superman searches the remains of Krypton for survivors. I don't know why Singer felt the need to cut this opening, especially when it was already shot, scored, edited, the effects completed, and (God, I hate when films do this) some of it was included in the theatrical trailer. It was a terrific opening! I do remember reading an interview some years ago in which Singer spoke of his idea to include the opening in a future theatrical re-release; I guess he overestimated the public's interest in the film, as did Warner Bros., which gave \\"Superman Returns\\" a $175-million budget. In any case, I'm glad the people who liked the film finally get to see it.<br /><br />Disc 8 is strictly bonus material and contains \\"Look! Up in the Sky!\\", the previously released feature-length documentary produced by Bryan Singer on the history of the character, and a brand-new documentary--yet again feature length-- called \\"You Will Believe\\" which concerns the rise and fall (and future rise?) of the Superman franchise. Both documentaries are in hi-def. Also included are featurettes exploring the scientific basis behind Superman, the comic's mythology, a tribute to Christopher Reeve, and a terrible, terrible old TV pilot, \\"The Adventures of Superpup\\".<br /><br />Superman was the first superhero (and if you can't tell by now, my personal favorite--sorry, Batman) in comics, and the first superhero to make the leap to a big-budget, non-camp film. Richard Donner, Tom Mankiewicz, Christopher Reeve and others pushed the boundaries of the character and paved the way for every other comic book property in Hollywood to be taken seriously. It remains to be seen where the character goes next in movies (I have more than a few reservations about the new Zack Snyder film due out next year) but based on where he's been, Superman deserves much cinematic respect. And with this Blu Ray set, he gets it in a BIG way.

0307887448|1.0|When you have read the back blurb, you know the whole story - geek triumphs over evil corp in a video game/trivia contest. The characters are uninteresting, the romance subplot unnecessary, the big reveal about the mysterious character we never see IRL being someone else IRL than online (gasp) is visible from miles away.<br /><br />The references to game and geek culture, which I suspect is what had the internet up in arms about this book (and why I read it), go exactly nowhere. Nothing about the 80s zeitgeist, no lessons learned from the age (except being good at pacman or whatever), nothing about computer games as art. No exploration that the main character's obessiveness might be bad, or a way of controlling the masses in this dystopian future.<br /><br />Deus ex machina up the wazoo - \\"btw. the main character also know this\\", \\"then the other ubergeek shows up and helps\\", etc. etc.<br /><br />The whole world is built up to support the ludicrous premise - geek beats megacorp at trivia/space invaders and saves the world. It, and the characters, serve no other function or purpose than to bring us from scene A to B.<br /><br />It reads like a satire over Neal Stephenson - like someone tried to do \\"Like that, but like a 12-year-old\\". It does not work.
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|once again, Tom Cruise, doing what he does best... getting a girl way out of his league, doing all sorts of actiony stuff, and still being sort of a goof ball from time to time. gotta love it :P
B00AQM8H9I|3.0|This app is a little too complex for my 4 year old, though he enjoys playing the game, he quite doesn't understand it. So his penguins get eaten by the sharks! I tried to play but I'm so not &#34;app games&#34; challenged. Hopefully he'll learn how to play it.
B00BUCW54Q|5.0|I know everyone is probably pretty tired of Tom Cruise by now, but I thought this movie was pretty good! Lots of action, lots of intrigue, a little humor here and there... all in all, I'd say it's at least worth seeing once!
B003TOMAPC|5.0|Quite violent, but great story that is insanely entertaining! I am excited about the second one and happy to own the first.
0307730700|5.0|It has been quite sometime since I became so engaged in a book that I laughed, cried and connected with the subjects of the text.  I did just that with \\"Fearless\\" by Eric Blehm.  What an amazing account of Adam Brown's life; his struggles, his perseverance, his courage and his faith.  What a fantastic account of God's pursuit of one man.  It encourages every person that God never gives up on us, especially at the darkest moments of our lives.  Instead, God surrounds us with people who He uses to draw us up out of those moments and strengthens us to continue to walk the journey He has placed before us and accomplish great and awesome things through His power.<br /><br />Adam Brown's story is an encouragement to all of us. Adam Brown is a hero who served his country exceptionally well; who served is family with unwavering love and who served his God and Jesus Christ with a devoted heart surrendered to Him.<br /><br />Eric Blehm wrote with integrity and shared with us the undiluted truth of Adam Brown's journey through life.  Be ready to laugh, to cry and to connect with Adam Brown as you journey through his life story which author Eric Blehm has so beautifully captured on the pages of \\"Fearless.\\"  At the end of the book, as you close the cover, you to will say as I did to the memory of Adam Brown \\"Well done good and faithful servant\\" you have done God, Family and Country proud!<br /><br /> \\"I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review.\\"
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I use Clean Master on my Kindle Fires (I am so happy with the Fire that I bought 3 of them for shared family use) and my Samsung smart phone.It does a great job of freeing up space on all of them.  I have it set to clear cache on my Smart phone whenever it is inactive.<br /><br />I highly recommend this app.
0061537969|3.0|Only one problem. Waited v..e..r..y long time to get the book.<br />I almost forgot the book what I ordered for my children.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Kept you guessing and on your toes. Really liked the characters. Kept me reading and didn't want to book the down.
B0095XPZBC|5.0|next generation on blu-ray looks all most like a new show can't wait for next set to come out love it
B005JABSB6|5.0|Like the title says. My wife wasn't happy with the Sharp an3dg30 glasses I purchased as the were not comfortable wearing over her prescription glasses. Honestly, I'm surprised that I couldn't find clip ones that will work with Sharp TVs, so these were the best alternative. Larger than the 30w, they covered her regular glasses more completely and blocked her peripheral vision better. So two thumbs up! And the price here was the best I could find on the net.
B006WAIV6M|4.0|This book is very helpful tool for you to change your life for better and drop bad habits. This book helped me to quit smoking and was helpful tool for me to succeed in many other aspects of my life. In case you are not willing to change your life for better even than this book is worth reading to understand a lot of tricks used in marketing to kindly force us to spend / waste our money:) Very knowledgeable!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Very easy read. Moving and well written. A story for anyone who loves true love and reading. Enjoy this book!
B00433C73S|4.0|This is one of the high water marks for Rennaisance. In particular the 20 minutes title track is on of the besat examples of symphonic rock. The other tuunes are very good, some not great 'A trip to the Fair' has great production and concept but they've hit lots of higher achievments musicaly in ther career. Still this is an essential album for fans, Casual Listeners may want to start with albums like 'Turn of the Cards' or 'Ashes are Burning'.
B006LSZECO|1.0|An awfull book. Certainly one the worst book I ever read. A totally disabused vision of the USA y a totally disbused author. Th retirement house smelled like chicken bbroth broth and piss. How bad can anyone write thecliches used a million times.<br />The guy's wife has been kidnapped and he feels like a \\"third teer speaker in a lousy convention\\". Really bad.
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|This book started out okay but as I continue to read it that Abby girl is really annoying. Her friend America is even more. What type of friend forces her to be around someone who is clearly a bad person. And would Abby just shit or get off the pot.
B0034G4OUO|4.0|Not the Rock's best movie,but his attitude in this one is intense. He had a plan and went through with it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Be careful with collecting your coins a few times I wasted my acorns on land tapping too fast. Also if you put in a kids age it gives you story characters as friends to play with and they gift back. Building's don't need road access to collect coins but you have to play to collect your coins so gets very time consuming if trying to build up on resources.<br /><br />Note if you miss a day you can pay acorns to restore progress if you don't it goes back to day 1. To be honest I play the game for myself and don't want the kids wasting my resources. Hoped this helped enjoy.
B005544V6A|5.0|As a lawyer, I usually stay away from lawyer shows.  But this one is absolutely addicting.  Great character development, witty repartee, keep-you coming-back plots.  Be careful, though, you might miss some sleep.  It's impossible to watch just one episode at a time.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|Book 1 started off slow but soon caught my interest and was all to soon finished. The second I was done reading it I was in the kindle store purchasing # 2 which I am barreling threw every night. Koth needs to keep telling the story and I need to read faster.
B0045TYDNC|5.0|It fits the indicated size lens and was very inexpensive.  Of course, it came fast and hassle free. I learned my lesson after smoking a couple lenses with my kerosene stove, and ruining a bunch of rolls of film, back in the day. Ever since, I put the caps on, front and  rear.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|Liked it a lot. Great to see older actors in an action flick. Wondering if there will be another one.
B00CHI5B7A|2.0|I was so looking forward to seeig this movie, but I think the only interesting parts are the ones from the previews.  For all the violence it was incredibly boring.
B00942Y4IY|4.0|One of the few sci-fi movies that I really enjoy. I've watched it about 10 times in my life and it is still entertaining.
0345529057|4.0|I haven't cracked these books open yet but they arrived quickly and in good condition.  I'm excited to burn through these this fall!
B006G3JQ78|5.0|This is a no brainer! It's a classic!<br /><br />My kids can't get enough of this movie. I should just buy it because I have a feeling that I'll be renting many more times.
B0057UA4CW|4.0|It's Stanley Kubrick and when it comes to him, being that I'm bias as he's my favorite, it's a great movie.
B00EEDJHXA|5.0|My 15 year old told me about this game.  I am totally hooked.  You have to plan out your moves in order to complete each level.  It's lots of fun and it can keep you busy for hours!  I highly recommend this game.
B008RA3X5E|2.0|It is not reliable and sounds awful.  Not enough brightness and odd. I don't know what else to say about it.
B003PBB4ME|5.0|Shipping was fast and the product as described. In my use of the grip, the top piece fell off. But all around I love this thing. It's a wonderful cheap accessory to have for easy camera stability.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|What a tough situation to find ones self in. I can not image how a person could not chose to keep believing in your child, even when a voice inside knows the real truth, what a dilemma one would never have to face in real life, I would hope! I am sure it does happen though, my heart would ache for the parent, sibling, etc. The story ending was not entirely unexpected, I kept feeling something else would come up, kept me totally involved in the story, sad after!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Enjoyed the challenge of finding the answers to the codes to open or find items and was disappointed when it ended at level 10.  I hope they make the other levels available soon.  I like challenging type puzzles so mostly enjoyed the challenge.
B007EECSFA|4.0|I thought it was very good, totally kept my interest, I have recommended this to many of my reader friends, as well as The Forgotten Garden, my favorite of her stories ! I am now reading The Secret Keeper, good so far, I like<br />The basically 2 stories in each book, going back into the past, with someone else's life,  coming back into the present, with other family members, always solving some unknown to a family member, or tying up some loose ends about family history! I think she is a very talented writer!
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|As a non combat pilot experienced pilot and WWII buff I was mesmerized by the story. Well researched and described with human goodness in mind.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|My Granddaughter Amaya loves this!  My nieces do to and they like to watch as the others play makes for a fun game they can share.
B00EFNXPFK|2.0|I loved John Mayer's first three albums so when Battle Studies came along I bought it immediately, big mistake... When Born and Raised came out I thought maybe Battle Studies was just a fluke and he has redeemed himself, wrong again. So like an idiot I gave him the benefit of the doubt again and again I got burned. Paradise Valley starts off pretty good but then after the first few songs you start thinking, \\"didn't I just hear that song?\\" It all sounds the same. There is very little positive I can say about this album so I'm not going to say anything except this IS the LAST John Mayer album I will EVER buy.
B003H4I4JU|3.0|It was not as interesting as I thought it would be after reading Ender's game.  I like Science fiction that is also somewhat &#34;believable&#34;  The alien Piggies were just not that intriguing.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have this on all my devices, Kindle, iPad, iPhone and it is indispensable! It's helpful to cross reference when I am reading through my paper Bible or perfect to have when I don't have a hard copy with me.
B0015DROBO|5.0|This is a great read.  The story moves along,but is well detailed so that it is a satisfying.  The main characters are fascinating and the author writes about them so that you become interested in them not just their part of the story.  Can't wait to read the next book  in the trilogy.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|All the characters are great. And the writing is smart and well-balanced. Hard to watch just one episode at a time.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome I've made a Town within 3 days try it it has creative and survival try it
B0071XO8RA|1.0|After reading the reviews raving about this book i decided to purchase it. I started reading it, and was instantly hooked. The unknowingness and curiosity of the outside world made me want to read more. However, after finishing the 1st intro book in the omnibus edition, the story slowed down. It went from being a sci-fi thriller to two senors looking for someone to interview for a job. I just could not bring myself to read it even after skipping ahead many pages in a last pitch attempt to find out where the action was hidden. \\"Wool\\" may be the book that all of these 5 star reviewers cannot put down, but that segment of the book must come after the application is filled.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Luv it thank u its really cool I got it for  really gud deal to I will always get my  stuff from here
B00C7E3EFU|5.0|THE 80'S PRODUCED MANY GREAT MOVIES AND THIS IS ONE OF THEM. IT'S A MUST TO HAVE THIS MOVIE IN YOUR COLLECTION. LOCATION,MUSIC,ACTORS PERFECT 10. THE PLOT IS SOMETHING ELSE,PEOPLE FROM THE PAST COMING BACK FOR THIER GOLD, AND REVENGE WOW!!!.SIT BACK WITH A PIZZA AND SODA IN YOUR FAVORITE CHAIR,AND ENJOY THIS CLASSIC MOVIE FOLKS.
B006RXQ69I|4.0|The ending is great and had an awesome cast! I can watch this movie over and over. Definately worth a rent or purchase!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Knew about the book for a while but really didn't get to read it.<br />Since the movie was coming up, I was genuinely interested and boy ... this book rocks!<br />took me few days to read it front to back and I had so much fun!
B00CXAAG6I|5.0|It's hard to rate this book--it makes you laugh and feel good, even when she is showing how grumpy she is!  I love her on the Web, and I love to see her in the book! Right-on! Keep your Grump on!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Found this while spending night in hospital, after I downloaded was actually able to get some sleep despite all those hospital noises.  Great find, will use on business trips as well to drown out hotel noise.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Interesting book with twists and turns.  Well written and uniquely laid out, which really added a new dimension to the story.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is the best escape game I have ever played. It takes some thought process to complete but we'll worth the time. I gave 5 stars! I would give more if I could. I saw a co-worker playing this and helped her with it. I liked it so well I bought the ads free version. I got through 10 levels and only needed help on level 8. I usually just play HO games but really enjoyed playing this escape game. It looks great on my Kindle HD. I didn't have any issues downloading it or playing it. I recommend everyone that likes this type or HO games to get this. It is well worth the money. I will have to find some more like this!<br /><br />Great job to the makers. More levels, please.<br /><br />I dropped my rating down a star because it is now July 16, 2014 and I am still waiting on new levels. I have played all 10 levels. They show new levels coming soon but I believe their soon and my soon are two different lengths of time. I will update again once they have added new levels.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Great ending to an amazing series.  I want to go back and read them all again. Sanderson did an excellent job ending the remarkable Jordan series.
B001G70M6S|5.0|Can't say enough good about this film. Not only is it Fun to shoot but it has a very classic and contrasty look about.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Season 3 was welcome as it brought back the humor, tension and drama that existed in Season 1, but was lost in Season 2.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|its really easy to use it helps out a lot when you have kids who don't let you work out because I can put it on while they nap and it doesn't make any noise.
0321928482|1.0|Beware the purchase of this book if you need help in just downloading thee sample images that Peachpit offers for demonstration<br />purposes. The book is useless if you cannot use the images for each lesson. I have not been able to download the images in a format that I can use on my widows 7 Vaio PC and the folks at Peachpit have chosen to ignore my many requests for help over the past 24 hours. This has been a most frustrating experience for me.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I could not get this book out of my thoughts once I started to read it, and I grew impatient to find out more of the story as I continued to read.  The depiction of the life of slavery on a plantation is clearly and unflinchingly depicted, the abuses plainly described, and all the while, reading it, I began to hope that somehow the heroine would survive and eventually prosper.<br /><br />It is a compelling story that will not leave me for a long time.  The cruelty of master to slave is unbelievable; a good reminder of where we have come from as a nation.  And Lavinia, the heroine, is masterfully brought from childhood through young adulthood, and finally to womanhood in a believable and compassionate way.  She suffers tremendously, but we are led to believe that her core strength and goodness will be her salvation.<br />The main characters are well developed, though at times it is confusing keeping minor characters in their right relationship to one another.  All in all I think it is an excellent summmer read.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|What else can be said about this movie then hasn't already been said, except buy it or rent it!  DUH...
1416972242|3.0|First 12 pages of the book had the lower corner missing from what I am assuming was a dog bite.  The rest was acceptable, I wish the description would have mentioned this though.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game, but wish I could win enough coins to play in more expensive rooms because you can win more in those rooms. But I keep coming back.
B002O3Z4QQ|3.0|Reenactments of historic events for which we have video footage generally fall short.<br /><br />I do not recommend this as a primary source of information.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game.Favorite on my Kindle. But proceed with caution because it is so very addicting! The slots games on this app are just as much fun!
B00A8FXT8M|4.0|How life often does not work out. Well written and brings you back to US days in other times.<br />Surprisingly still how it can refer to current times.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|This is a good app. I like the graphics. I would like to see more detail on the extended forecast and it would be great if it included access to radar.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|It's a Blu-ray of Les Miserables, the family loved it, although it was sold at COSTCO for the same price.
B0085OELXK|5.0|A review on the Huffington Post made me re-look at this film and frankly it was better the second time around, read the reviewer far better insight than anything I would have to say!<br />[...]
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Great book!<br />Loved it.<br />Good plot and cool characters<br />Buck is very brave and cool.<br />A wonderful exciting page turner!
B008UX2UIO|5.0|It is an incredible book from a unique writer who is sadly no longer alive.  I would have read anything by him.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Haven't received Season 3 yet,  but In know I'm going to love it  .Season 1 &2 just great series.  Couldn't stop watching and anxious for Season 3.
1439152810|5.0|4.5 Stars<br /><br />Kate Morton's latest novel, The Secret Keeper, is a richly imagined tale of love. lies and long-buried secrets.  After bearing witness to a horrific crime involving her mother, Laurel Nicolson's view of her beloved parent was forever changed.  Now, many years later, gathering together with her sisters and brother to celebrate what will likely be their dying mother's final birthday, Laurel decides it's time to delve deeper into Dorothy Nicolson's past in an effort to uncover the truth behind her mother's actions on that day.<br /><br />Morton's narrative unfolds in a deliberately measured manner, taking the reader on a journey back in time to pre-World War II England, through to the Blitz and the early 1960s, revealing in bits and pieces Dorothy's early life and the decisions and events that shaped the woman she was to become.  Through her always eloquent prose, Morton is able to effectively convey the hopes, fears and overall emotions of each of her characters, successfully drawing the reader completely into their stories.  She is also able to evoke a strong sense of time and at no point is this more evident than when the narrative is set during the Blitz.  Much like she has done in her other novels, Kate Morton has once again created a memorable cast of characters that readers can empathize with and become invested in.<br /><br />Although I found the opening of this novel to be somewhat slow, once the narrative starts to focus on Dorothy's life I found The Secret Keeper difficult to put down.  Although this book does not feature the Gothic elements that are a hallmark of Morton's previous releases, I nevertheless found this story to be every bit as captivating.<br /><br />The Secret Keeper is a must read for every Kate Morton fan.
6301390725|4.0|If you only know Angela Lansbury as a nosy detective you need to watch this movie to see another side of her talent.  You have adventure, you have music, you have a cartoon portion, you have mystery and you have a movie that is safe to watch with your family.
B000FBJAF0|1.0|This book is truly a guy book. It was referred to me by my son because he knows I like revenge movies but this book is all about wars and is loaded with boring descriptions of people, places and things that I cared nothing about. Every place he went, he had to describe in detail. Too many names, too many names of places, too many big words. I got so tired of looking up words in the dictionary. His writing sounds more like he's trying to impress everyone with his vocabulary. I'm already up to chapter 26 and I haven't even got to the revenge part yet. I find myself skipping over words trying to read as fast as I can just to get to the good part. 26 chapters and I haven't read anything interesting yet. I keep hoping it'll get better. If you're a guy and you've been to Viet Nam, you'd probably love this book. My son Loved it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME if you play it once you can't stop!! Mojang all you need to add is Redstone rail/carts and caves ty but still buy this game and you'll love it
B000NQRE0K|5.0|One of the best movie ever made and even if you don't like Mel Gibson you will love this movie.
B00AQ7J4DQ|5.0|It was like i purchased a brand new movie! Not a single scratch or finger print was found and the box it comes in was in perfect shape! Loved it!
B005544V6A|5.0|The writing, the characters, everything about the show is awesome. Start watching and you will be hooked. The cast isn't very hard to look at either!
B002M5E2DW|5.0|Easy to read, inspiring,  good book to have handy beside the bed! thank you very much for sharing the secret with us!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I have lost money when trying to purchase more coins to play. This has happened several times. I just joined the elite bingo. I am enjoying it so far. I would appreciate responses from Bingo Blitz when there are problems. Thanks.
B006SV2LWA|5.0|Steven Soderbergh films sometimes blow me away.  Like &#34;Sex Lies and Videotape&#34;, the subject matter is both confusing and destressing (for very different reasons) but the hold on the audience is real from the opening credits, Gwyneth Paltrow dies 10 minutes into the film, Kate Winslet dies in the first hour, Jude Law plays a profiteering jerk.  Business and travel grind to a halt.  The entire film is gripping from the first scene to the last.  I have watched it several times and expect to watch it many times more.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|A lot of brass hitting the floor. Very entertaining, a little budget but not to bad.<br />I would watch it again
B00CCCF4NW|3.0|After absolutely loving Jon Hopkins' first album, \\"Opalescent\\", I must confess to being a bit disappointed in each of his subsequent albums.  Maybe I just \\"don't get it\\", but to me it seems like every album since \\"Opalescent\\" has degenerated because they are infused with too many random, extraneous, percussive noises, not unlike an auto mechanic's tool chest (or my wife's purse) being dumped onto a concrete floor.  On a positive note, the later tracks on this album, \\"Immunity\\", display less of these distractions and are more in the vein of \\"Opalescent\\".
B000P407K4|5.0|couldn't make a show like is today. Peter Sellers is wonderful. The ill thoughts that went into this film is worth the watch
B003EV6DBM|5.0|It was thoughtful, exciting. All is in ordung. It is a great way to spend several evenings. English & Scottish accents are the best. If I wasn't an anglophile before, I would be now. Taught English grammar for 23 years.
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|TTB  has  the sound of  a band that's  truly a band . The horns ,especially , have gelled , and have a fullness which -to me- was lacking . Derek's slide work has also found its place within the group , and meshes with the rhythm section - as another vocalist would ! Susan's singing is wonderful , and always soulful .  This is -at times -a rockin' unit that has the drive to make you want to get up & move !!!
B001NHNG64|4.0|Great book with lots of great action all the way through - really good reading when you want something light and easy to digest
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|nothing much to say, this book explains with examples the common problems of someone working in IT for a big company.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I love this book, it is so funny and so cleaver.  I couldn't put it down. I have recommended it to all my friends.
B001MSMULG|4.0|Good story.  Keeps you interested. I don't like the F bombs. Not necessary in literature.  I'm from the old school. We didn't use that language.
B001F12J48|1.0|This is does not work on the newer technology 3D TV's and 3D players. It's the old red and blue screen with the glasses included with the package. I would not buy this unless you like watching old style 3D movies with red and blue glasses. I was seriously disappointed.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|love what it does in functionality . Should have come as part of the original purchase, not nickel and dime me to download.
B005CRQ3UC|5.0|A wonderful way to introduce colors to very young children, but be prepared to read it over and over again.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I really like the fact that Calculator Plus Free  runs in full screen mode, making it much easier to see and to operate. It has all of the functions that I need, and not so many that I don't ever use (e.g. scientific notation).  So far I am very impressed with it, and I highly recommend it.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I have had great fun playing bingo blitz!<br />Meeting a lot of very nice people!<br />Best game to play on my kindle fire.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game so pleased I can play it on my kindle, had a few problems with freezing but credits returned,seems to have sorted itself out now.
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|I like Cruize and I like Morgan...together you think this would be great...They both took the money and run in this deal...this movie was terrible from beginning to end...The droids were the only cool thing in the movie...Sad...
B003EXY1WS|5.0|I will not start speaking of Avenged Sevenfold otherwise I will need a website on its own. For the non-metal and rock fans, listen to the classics and drama behind the screaming. If you only hear screaming, heavy metal and rock, you don't have a music ear. The singer Matthew Sanders (M.

Thank you A7X for switching me from the Madonnas, Trances, EDMs, and Club Music, to only YOU. Love you, your style, your voices, the talents of the guitarists syncing with the drummer, and the hard work behind each and every song. I hear their Hail to the King new album being released on Tuesday the 27th of August 2013 and it is already pre-ordered. This latest album is inspired by the group gathering and listening to classical music from Bach, Mozart and others, and trying to understand what makes these classical composers so great. And they understood, wrote and produced songs that are nothing but their own style but with a greater classical and drama sense only a music ear can hear. DADT; dgaf

And they understood, wrote and produced songs that are nothing but their own style but with a greater classical and drama sense only a music ear can hear. DADT; dgaf
0375869026|5.0|it's an absolutely amazing book! I think everyone should read it although it's put into the teenage section.<br />You can learn a lot from this book too.
B00122HT04|5.0|If I start writing about A7X, I will need a website on its own. I am just in love with their style of music, looks and everything else. While some may think there is a lot of screaming, I believe that the ability of Matthew Sanders (M. Shadows) to sing in such high and low without even a blink (even live), is just unbelievable. For non-heavy metal or rock fans, I recommend you close your eyes and listen beyond the metal and rock, listen to the classic and drama built-in within each song. If you have a music ear, you will hear, if not, it is a simple rock and heavy metal for you. Thank you A7X for switching me from the Madonnas, EDMs, Trances and Goa, to simply YOU.
B001GUXJQA|4.0|Michael Connelly is always a good read.  Still enjoy the Harry Bosch character and story lines.  Black Ice is no exception.
B0075PXDUM|5.0|I will not start speaking of Avenged Sevenfold otherwise I will need a website on its own. For the non-metal and rock fans, listen to the classics and drama behind the screaming. If you only hear screaming, heavy metal and rock, you don't have a music ear. The singer Matthew Sanders (M. Shadows) has an amazing talent reaching highs and lows with a strong scream-like voice with no miss whatsoever even live. Thank you A7X for switching me from the Madonnas, Trances, EDMs, and Club Music, to only YOU. Love you, your style, your voices, the talents of the guitarists syncing with the drummer, and the hard work behind each and every song.

B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|I thought this book did a great job of setting the historical contexts and stage for the life of Christ but I felt certain Scriptures were accepted as legit and others dismissed as myth in ways that supported his perspective of the person of Christ.<br /><br />I think the Gospels were manipulated a bit to make Christ sound more exclusive with His love of others rather than all embracing.

B0000640VO|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  I recommend it in the original French version rather than subtitled--it would lose some of its charm if it was in English.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Usually the slavery stories are around the Civil War era.  This was slightly different. I enjoyed the characters. Sweet read.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a really cool game.  Every time you play it there are different routes, obstacles to overcome, etc.  I have played it literally hundreds of times and it never gets old.  Sometimes it gets me right away, and if I am on my game, I have scored over a million points.  My daughter has scored over three million points.  The scenery and action are top notch.  It is probably the best game I have ever played.
B0010T3UV6|5.0|Great shoes for commercial kitchen work. Non slip,and my feet don't get fatigued.  Far more comfortable than the clogs traditionally worn in the food industry.
B000I9WW0E|5.0|This is a must see flick. There are so many quotables there is not room to list them the<br />Dude abides White Russians for everbody
B007EE564U|4.0|Mitch Rapp ? With the central character's moniker sounding like a10 year olds action man figure, you have a feeling the improbable will be done immediately , the impossible will take a little longer, and it does.  The CIA Rocks !!!!  Go Mitch !!!
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|Can't stop listening to this! It has everything I want to hear in an album all rolled into one. Amazing guitar solos (which is a given if you're buying a JM album) love, unmatched vocals, western, folk, country, love, life, adventure. It's just so chill. Love the mix of instruments and genres! Already pre-ordered it & it will be worn out! You should do the same.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Good graphics and challenging puzzles. I didn't have any issues with the game loading on my kindle. I am looking forward to the next one.
B00DHHWYAW|5.0|Watching the Great gatsby in blu ray makes the movie better and more incredible. it is such a vibrant movie, and stunin in blu ray.. The blue ray copy is absolutly worth every penny.
B000JMKTLO|2.0|It was entertaining but definitely bordered upon crappy.  I bought it after having read GONE GIRL which was a great read.  But... the main character of SHARP OBJECTS was just hard to relate to.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It's better than the movie, well written.  Looking forward to reading more from the author.  would recommend it to others
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was really, really entertaining.  Absolutely twisted but certainly a page turner.  Another good point is the fact that although the book *could* be made into a movie, I never got the feeling that Flynn wrote it FOR the movies.
0738737909|1.0|The deck was not manufactured correctly. The film of paint was not properly transferred to the sides. Dirt residue causes paint to lift off and cause damage to the deck.
B00DGMVJAO|2.0|Sorry to say...I thought it was a kinda boring, shallow, and silly. It needed better character development. The plot just didn't capture my interest but different strokes for different folks.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|great mob movie.  performances by all stars are wonderful.  This movie is a classic up there with Godfather 1 and II
B00CAUHF6U|5.0|The in depth detail is extraordinary. Amazing insight into what brought him from his humble tribal beginnings to determined hero against all odds for Africa for Africans. How he managed to pursue and rally his ideals even in the horrific conditions of imprisonment his beyond belief.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I am really bios to this because I love marvel and the Avengers but this and Iron-Man 3 are amazing.
B00AW8UK0K|4.0|At last a considered approach to health without fad diets which fail, something anyone can live with without radical changes. Works for range of people from those just wanting to shed a little in the right places, to more challenging obesity. And the research to back it up, plus lots of feedback and well organised method such as compehensive list of calories for amounts of foods.
B009O2XY12|5.0|As with most games, the levels get more challenging, and actually like the way the game limits you to five games, or else I'd be playing all day!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I enoyed the Irish background and the gradual recovery from abandoned baby grown to a despairing man. The details of his life and the woman he meets when he finally agrees to seek a partner are touching in the fragility of both characters. If you like happy endings you will enjoy it.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|really wonderful and entertaining reading- you have the &#34;feel good&#34; feeling already at the first page - the words are in his power. Read it!
B009VIZDLI|4.0|Setting out to find a partner with a scientifically detailed questionnaire to everyone but himself borders on the ridiculous. How can this obsessive probably autistic professor exoect success. And yet the book is compulsive reading as you follow this crazy project.
B0064BWE8U|3.0|A day on the day bed in the garden under a beaming sun and you are very well entertained- a feel good novel- nothing to think about just relax and laugh
B00821OX98|3.0|This show is average. The storylines are weak and somewhat predictable and the special effects do not deserve the production stamp of Steven Spielberg. I am at the beginning of Season 2 and already bored enough to find something else to watch. I had such high expectations of this show, especially with the famed Spielberg ingredient, but it unfortunately failed to meet my expectations. Give it a go, but lower your expectations and you will probably enjoy it more than I did.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is a great game. Very addictive though. I can't wait for the next update. I would recommend it but don't overdo I t.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Enjoyed the movie..it gave a good insight to people who suffer with bipolar disorder. The acting was superb. Great ending.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is the best bingo game ever. It updates New games and data all the time and seasonal and holiday rooms are great
B008P1EWIM|5.0|It works very well, and it will be nice to wake up in the morning to have the time AND weather right on my nightstand. Weather Live rocks!
B00EAI9CSY|3.0|The movie had a lot of potential, but about 3/4 of the way it started to fizzle out. I was disappointed with how it all ended. On the upside, I loved the score.
B005THRU0C|5.0|i love all the songs on this cd- it has all of his greatest hits that are played on the radio, but also some great songs that i've never heard before!! it was definately worth paying another couple dollars to get 3 or 4 more songs of his- those songs are amazing too!!!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Hachi is the best dog's tale.  So touching because it is based on a true story.  Keep a hankie close by.
B007DIQC90|5.0|when i first heard little talks, i fell in love with the band! i had to get a cd, and am so glad that i did! they have great songs, and i love hearing the difference between the male and female singer's voices- how some songs show off her voice and some songs show off his... and then there's the ones with both and it's amazing!!
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I got this for 2 dollars in a lightning deal on black friday of 2012. I was one of the people that grew up with the Harry Potter series and movies, so this one was particularly nostalgic. It is a great movie, cinematically speaking, as well as worthy of heart strings being tugged of the so many faithful fans that have supported this series from the beginning all the way to its end. I will admit to my share of tears by the end of this movie. Its suspenseful, dramatic, and at some points funny as well. A MUST WATCH.
B002ZB26AO|3.0|After reading &#34;Escape from camp 14&#34; this book was secondary. Some information was interesting regarding how our country turns a blind eye toward North Korea.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I normally go for crime thrillers but saw the series and like the complete escapism of these novels.  Knights and their castles, dragons, wolves and the walking dead!<br /><br />What I also like is that you read the story from the view point of several main characters.  Each one very different, but all credible.
0920236162|4.0|I had this book as a kid in the early 90s and wanted to buy it for my cousin who is learning how to read. She's obsessed with Disney princesses, pink, and ballet and I wanted to give her a more open-minded and accessible female positive book that doesn't involve a damsel in distress. I think this book hits those marks, as well as being a challenging read for a kindergartener.<br /><br />For me, personally, it stressed the princesses beauty a bit too much for my liking, but my cousin (age 5) liked it. She read it to me and laughed at all the illustrations. Maybe in the 90s and before there were less female positive princesses and this book meant more to my mom and me as a kid. Now she has Pocahontas, Mulan, and Merida to look up to while I had Ariel and Belle and the classic damsels. It's the lesser of the two evils, but in no means as progressive as I was hoping.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Our son and his wife got us hooked on this great TV series.  It is nice to see something that is not a US production.  I love how the characters interact with each other and the story line is strong.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|so much depth and talent these guys have. they are too awesome for words. bluegrass and indie combined?! yes, please!
B001E6X4W0|5.0|Although I loved it much more when it first came out, I still find great charm in the movie, even if it can be gory at times!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I would rather go straight to the game instead of seeing all the games they have to offer but other then that it's a great game with lots to do.
0767020308|5.0|Related to Downton Abbey television program with meaningful actors and an interesting story.Suspenseful story keeps viewers guessing what is next......
B0015DYIH2|4.0|This book is good light reading and had me on the edge of my seat at points. It's meant to be fun, not mind-blowing. Anyone that is looking for something different will be disappointed.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love the Weather channel. I go into the Weather Channel every morning to see what the day will be like.<br />Also in the evening
B000MDDSB8|5.0|this movie is great streaming and awesome sound quality<br />one you can now appreciate on big digital flat screen tv<br /><br />one that a sequel would be great
B0094BB4TW|5.0|i love facebook its a good way to socialize. but thes alot of bulling on there.but it cant hurt me,im tough. ;)
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|For a movie, it's great, awesome visuals, music and acting. Very entertaining. Some people might find its accuracy upsetting, but its a movie not a book.
B001O1O71C|1.0|I only read it for school summer reading. It's the worst book ever, no doubt about that. All of my other friends agreed with me, so count this rating as 16 other kids who all agree.
B008OOYALE|5.0|youer game is not letting me play Cu's it ses team lava has stoped ti's game. and I cant play game
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|This game is fun and you do not slash the screen to attack. You can call reinforcements change characters and upgrade EVERYTHING!
B000001ESF|5.0|Best album Ive ever heard, I had it on vinyl in high school and have now bought the CD. Been awhile since I could listen to it and its only gotten better.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's like the old one but with new graphics, new gameplay, and all the items you buy in temple run 1 are all there without you buying them. I think it's a great game.
B008A36R2Y|5.0|it's perfect it's really easy to use it comes on time and even the box it's amazing you should buy one or two i really recomend it
B000HC2LI0|5.0|So thrilled to have the complete set of West Wing. It was delivered faster than anticipated and was beyond my expectations to receive such a compact \\"presidential\\" looking addition to our DVD library. As we RV a lot we will always have quality viewing as we watch all the episodes and behind the scenes takes. Thanks amazon for this very affordable treasure.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This book made me much more aware of how I was communicating with important people in my life. Introvert or extrovert, you don't know how many blind spots you'll become aware of while reading this. Highly recommended.
0307386171|4.0|A very good read however the topic does tend to get rather boring. Well written on a topic that some people even today have a problem talking about.<br /><br />Entertaining? mmm depends on your view of entertainment. For me it was not entertaining however it was a curious look at sexual encounters for novices.
B009WUBERW|5.0|Action packed. From the opening scene, it was eye catching action. No doubt, it is the &#34;Who's who&#34; of action/adventure movies.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|We listened to the audiobook read by the author. It is enough story to drive you round-trip from Los Angeles to Lake Tahoe so that the five-hundred miles passes too quickly. My husband and I have experienced all three of Hosseni's books this way and have enjoyed each. His characters are colorful and believable - if incredibly sad. The culture, which is brutal at times, is presented honestly, in a way that fosters understanding and compassion. My only criticism of this book is that during the last quarter of the story the lines and junctures were a bit confusing. However, we highly recommend any of this author's works.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love playing mahjong and this app lets u keep playing and trying to beat your previous scores. To get better and better. Real challenging boards.
B005544TRQ|5.0|My favorite show in TV would recommend. It just keeps getting better and better. Five stars all the way.  Can't wait for the new season.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Picture is perfect.  Much better than on my computer.  Any subject I want to look up is available. What more can you ask for!
B0093X805W|5.0|This is the BEST book I have ever read in my life. It is really hard to put down once you start reading it. I usually
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|A quick read, but very helpful for learning how and why to communicate with your partner and really anyone in general. Very eye opening with a lot of good points and stories.
B007AL48UK|5.0|I've enjoyed a number of matching games like this, and I personally enjoy this one more than most others.  The graphics tickle my sense of humor - somehow it's more fun for me to match flip flops and beach balls than bamboo sticks and wind directions.  I like the choices of different layouts, the ability to re-shuffle and keep going, to pause or back up, and I especially like being able to turn off sound effects that would otherwise become really annoying after several repetitions.  I suppose other folks might like the ability to see best times and best scores too.
B002M9WW30|5.0|A great collection to have and to watch, Stallone is an awesome actor! having all of the movies in the series together in a convenient tin is also great!
B006PIXKVW|5.0|Love the quality and love the movie, I would recommend this movie to any family!! Every little girl would benefit from this movie. Forever a classic in my eyes :)
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|A mish mash of a lot of sci-fi movies and ideas, but in a totally entertaining and quality way. Highly recommend.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|This is a fantastic history of my all time favorite band.  This story really tells it all, the good and bad sides of this fantastic group that gets better with age.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Kenneth Branagh, as director, did a fantastic job with this film! The pacing was perfect, and, rather than just a smash-em-up action flick, this one actually had a bit more of a substantial narrative thrust. Think father-son-brother relations and the maturation of the protagonist all blown to epic scale in the guise of Norse legend. The only weak characters (and lackluster acting) in this film were Thor's 3 loyal friends who get few lines and some (in my view) awkward appearances. Well worth watching more than once.
B009WHDE3C|5.0|I loved this movie, and bought it for my mother-in-law to see.  She loved it as much as I did - especially since much of the cast was of her generation.  Wonderful story, wonderful characters.  Suitable for viewers of all ages, but probably particularly appealing to mature viewers, as it's a very relatable plot.
B00DHNBPA6|3.0|It was ok for the first hour or so, then it got pretty lame. The story line seemed to drag on after the initial plot began to thicken, and I got bored with it the last part of the movie as it became a typical screamfest.
B004SIP8JI|3.0|It's funny to see Hugh Jackman play the role he did in this movie, really makes you appreciate him as an actor. I also appreciate the innocence in this movie, and making it more of a true love story without all the sex that is seemingly required in any &#34;romance&#34; flick these days.<br /><br />The story is good, but for the intense movie critic, could have be refined. Overall, a cute flick.
B003E6LC6I|5.0|Loved every minute of this season! It totally had me on the edge the entire time. Tons of twists and turns. Two thumbs way up!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Slowly but surely working through the series.  Very entertaining characters, I'm having a little trouble following some of the characters but it will all fall into place as I catch up.  I need time to do a marathon.  Great show.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love Downton Abbey.  I cannot wait for season 4.  Historic fiction is so fascinating.  The ending definitely leaves you on the edge of your seat anticipating the next season.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I REALLY ENJOY THIS GAME. I WISH I HAD MORE DAILY CREDITS AND IT WAS EASIER TO WIN LAST ITEM IN EACH ROOM BUT THAT'S GAME PLAY I GUESS. EVEN GOT MY MOM HOOKED ON IT.
B004UO0SAO|2.0|Good tool but I hate the logo.<br /><br />Sorry but I had to delete it from my system.<br /><br />Thanks for the test
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|I want to appreciate the texture of the rice, the firmness of the fish, and the flavors. There was so much depth that I never knew about.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is alot of fun and help lower my stress level by relaxing me befor and after a long day at work. I really enjoy this bingo it my fav out of all of them.
B00DP8XSQ2|1.0|It didn't seem to work on my Kindle Fire HD no matter what I did.  I deleted it, & would not recommend it .
B003XMWSSY|5.0|I have  read many books on writing by famous authors and agents before, some more than once. Many talk about plot elements and dramatic content and characterization--which is all good. But Noah Lukeman's approach gets into some common mistakes in the structure of your writing. For instance, it has the best explanation of Show-Don't-Tell I ever saw.<br /><br />Why wouldn't any serious aspiring writer buy it and read it?<br /><br />Thanks Noah for a really worthwhile book.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|Loved this very much. Brought tears t my eyes after knowing he is no longer with us sad but tru may he R.I.P
B009NQZVKG|4.0|Great mix of real science, history, action and just a bit of the extraordinary.<br />Wish they'd make a TV series out of these.
B00CJGP116|5.0|The best ever. Amazon surprized me with this purcahse. I thought I was paying more till I get the bill Fantastic and very happy for sure!!!! Love this Cd and fact I could rip made it even more worth it... Thank you amazon~
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Between the cities you have to open and the puzzles you have to do,this is not just a couple hour game. It's timed and at times frustrating .
B004KPLVV8|4.0|In this fantasy movie we are introduced to &#34;the Grid&#34;, an idea that computer programs could be imagined as individual people living their lives in cities built of platforms and networks. It is a visually very stylistic concept where everything glows and one of the most dreaded fates is to be forced to participate in video games. When I saw this movie as a kid I had no concept of what the supposed functions of each of the computer program people were. I was simply mesmerized by the glowiness and action. Going back and watching again as an adult I am able to comprehend the reasons why programs personalities were as the were based upon the kinds of tasks they were assigned to do. Unfortunately I am also old enough and an experienced movie watcher that the 80's movie dialogue is a bit over the top and unrealistic for my tastes. I would suggest that to fully appreciate the latest movie &#34;Tron: Legacy&#34; it is a good idea to see the original at least once. I am happy to have this one in my DVD collection but it may not stay in the front row of the shelf for too long.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I have really enjoyed playing this game. Good time killer! I play on my kindle,phone, and computer. Definitely recommend this game to everyone.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I should have started these books ages ago when I started watching the series. There are so many more details that have come to light upon reading this book. It is pure genius!
B009YN2M7S|5.0|THE BOOK WAS GREAT I WILL READ IT AGAIN SOON  YOU SHOULD READ IT SOMETIME SOON I WILL GET IT AGAIN
B00D56GJCE|5.0|I started watching this and I couldn't stop ordering the next installment.  I stayed up all night, now it is 9am and now I can rest because I just finished the series. Great acting and lots of twists to keep it super interesting.
B007SOQBCM|5.0|Pros:<br />Easy access in the main menu. Very responsive, and amazing quality.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Can't access chat, but the quality makes up for it.<br /><br />Beercules.
B001RCD2DW|4.0|I just purchased AKG 702 from amazon at $265.  I compared this to my Denon D2000, the Denon sounds much richer.<br />Considering the price difference between the two (the D2000 costs $200 more), the AKG 702 is a good buy.<br />And I like AKG 702's dettached cable.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|It really works eaven when I don't have time to get to the gym! I highly recommend this app Love it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a very fun game my child enjoys this game so much she said its just like having a real horse witch she has one but she said she feels its the same
B002ZG974W|5.0|I love this movie. But in high-definition is spectacular. The cinematography, the locations are awesome. Yhe kids are lovely. Thanks!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|For a free app it's hard to beat. Does everything you'd expect it to do for the price free and then some.
B0030V0PEW|5.0|Well written, easy to navigate, compelling, useful -- applies to any field, company, management situation, task, project, team, or plan.
B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|Right now this is the game that I am playing the most on my phone.  It is fun and unique in my experience.  My favorite feature is that there is no time limit to make a move.  It lets you think your move out so the game is less frantic reaction and more thoughtful planning.  The game teaches you how to play with a great in-game tutorial.  I am glad that I picked this game up.
B00B6OEDS4|5.0|Way cool to hear Rhye as the background music in Newsroom (Jim's romantic hotel room setup for Hallie Aug 18, 2013.) As was said on NPR's All Songs... Rhye is \\"crushed velvet.\\" My top find for 2013!
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|I love this game.  The graphics are beautiful and the play is fast paced and fun.  It reminds me of a lot of old arcade games like Galaxian and Galaga and others of that ilk.  I truly enjoyed figuring out the meanings and uses of all the power-ups.  I picked this game up as a FAOTD but I would pay the 2 bucks to have it if I had to.
0394721780|5.0|I bought this as a gift, and it was well received. I also have a copy, and whenever I prepare a particularly good meal, my husband credits Julia!
B00DQBWLSO|4.0|OK. I didn't even know this album was coming out until late July if I recall correctly. I was surprised because [[ASIN:B007MAETA8 Born and Raised]] had just came out May 2012 and John generally takes at least 2 years to release albums. I wasn't completely wowed by lead single \\"Paper Doll\\" but I pre-ordered the album a week ahead of time because John generally never lets me down with his albums.<br /><br />On a whole though the album does seem a little rushed especially vocally. On many songs John sounds a bit underwhelmed and it can be distracting. I also have to say that lyrically John does not give his great insight on this record. Most of his albums have great lyrics. For John most of these lyrics are on the average/simple side which is pretty disappointing. :(<br /><br />On the positive side this album is very laid-back and calm. It is also a lot more upbeat lyric-wise than last year's album. The last thing that I can think of that is really great is that there is much more guitar in this album than the last. Now before you go thinking \\"Yay! Another [[ASIN:B0014VPFTA Continuum]]!\\"...No. Just stop. The guitar is more prominent here but the album as a whole just doesn't compare to his 2006 album lyrically or in guitar arrangement.<br /><br />I like most of the songs on the album except for \\"Call Me The Breeze\\" which is average. My favorite track is actually track number 1 \\"Wildfire\\". It's an upbeat love song that just makes you feel good.<br /><br />As a whole the album is solid but underwhelming compared to ANY of his past studio works. No, it's not even better than 2009's [[ASIN:B002QEXN2K Battle Studies]]. I actually gave that album a 3.5 at the time but it has since grown on me. Vocally he doesn't seem as invested in many of the songs and lyrically the songs would be alright if this wasn't John Mayer. But it is and it was him who previously released the epic [[ASIN:B0000ALSDR Heavier Things]] which was his most lyrically impressive work to me. This album is lyrically-lightweight compared to it.<br /><br />All in all, if you liked [[ASIN:B007MAETA8 Born and Raised]] from last year then there is still some things to like about this work as it's similar in sound. Just don't expect it to blow you away. [[ASIN:B007MAETA8 Born and Raised]] was a welcome breath of fresh air to me and although it was a much sadder album he was much, MUCH more invested in that material to me. Plus every song on that album was damn good.<br /><br />4 stars.rically-lightweight compared to it.<br /><br />All in all, if you liked [[ASIN:B007MAETA8 Born and Raised]] from last year then there is still some things to like about this work as it's similar in sound.

B00BC24NT4|5.0|I am a lifelong fan of Mr. le Carre, so he can do know wrong. I don't believe thegre is much parallel with the two recent so-called &#34;whistleblowers&#34; and the honorable protagonists of this novel.
B00AQ71FLK|1.0|I can't even download the I've deleted nearly all of my apps and it still won't download! Don't get the app. I only have 4apps left and it still won't download!!!
B00846REIS|5.0|Really good book ! I enjoyed it so much I read part 1 ,2, and 3 twice and I would read it  again !
B0000AM6IY|4.0|This is a good musical. I got it because I had heard some of the songs, and had always wanted to see the movie. Seems like it dragged somewhat at times. Music is good.
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|I have read ALOT of fantasy.  This novel sticks out.  Yes you will often times find yourself thrown into a story about a theif or a rogue who becomes a hero, but how often does he stay outside the law.  Locke Lamora is unapologetic about his way in life and stays true to himself the whole novel.  His development is handled not in changing who is he, but in him slowly realizing wha the is willing to do for the things he believes in and the people he loves.<br /><br />The dialogue in the book is witty though it could be said that most of the Gentleman Bastards speak similarly.  I find this forgivable due to the humor.  I find my self caring for almost every character in the book.  Or at least I am symphathetic.  I look forward to reading the rest of these novels as they come out.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I really like this alarm clock but I can't get the music to wake me up but over all it is a great app.
B003ASLJO0|5.0|I'm a huge Clint Eastwood fan.  I love this movie, and if you haven't seen it - you will too!  He is amazing.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Excellent way to play magic on the go. No flaws yet playing it on my S3. Glad you can finally build your own deck been waiting years for that feature
B00932A4XE|3.0|it is ok but only ok...wouldn't really waste my time when there are so many good movies to watch. more of a teenie-bopper type movie!
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|Great time killer good graphics and smooth game play would definitely suggest this game for anyone young and old alike
B001C4AFOY|5.0|Who does historical dramas better than the British. The story, the scenes , the costumes all fantastic. Emily Blunt and an all star cast add richness to the story. A real love story.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Fun game and easy to play. Would recommend to anyone looking for something similar to Sim city but cant get it on moble
B008220C38|5.0|This was an imaginative remake of a Classic Story. The scenes, and the costumes were not to be missed. If you like Keira Knightly in period pieces, then this movie is for you. Jude Law was a pleasant surprise. This version is now part of my DVD collection.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|Great little Seiko watch. White hands against a black dial makes it easy to see anytime. Lightweight but you can tell there's still quality. I love my new Seiko and I've had many in my time. Hehe, no pun intended.
B000OPPBEQ|3.0|The movies are still the ones I remember but the packaging is sub par. I had the DVD version years ago and I remember it looking better but this one is poorly done. The big box is ok but the blueray cases are cheap superslim kind and the cover art looks like  the ones you find on the old single movie dvd cases.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This book was recommended to by two people in a few days, so I thought I'd give it a look.  I was expecting a more technical manual regarding running, but was very pleasantly surprised to get a wonderful read of an enchanting running story.  It inspired me, and I highly recommend it.  There is some technical stuff kinda hidden within the expertly composed story that can be gleaned, but only as much or as little as one is looking for.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This novel is a beautifully written story about what life was like for children, specifically one girl named Dorothy, who found new families as a result of taking the orphan train out west.  Dorothy spends time with several families before eventually finding her forever family.  The story also incorporates a present day element featuring the journey of a foster child and her experience.  I learned a lot reading this story, specifically what conditions the orphans had to endure and what they were subjected to and how difficult it was for them to leave their past behind them to conform to a new family's expectations.  Compounding the trauma of losing their families, they were sent out into an unknown world to survive.  This is a story of survival and of redemption as well.  Lovely book and well worth the read!!
B008CRC506|5.0|The delivery was timely.  The show itself is excellent if you like singing and dancing.  Also the DVDs worked without any kince of problems.
B009GFEOY8|3.0|It worked but was just ok. Too expensive. Not sure if I will purchase again.  Not sure if it was the camera or the film itself.  All the pictures were blurry.
B004LWZW42|4.0|They did a great job on the movie although I would have picked someone other than Jennifer Lawrence for Mystique.  The rest of the cast did a great job.  I particularly liked the way they developed the relationship between Professor X and Magneto.
B00007BK2N|5.0|This one is on my list of all time favorites.  Joy Division and New Order fans must have this movie.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I play almost everyday and get a bit tired of lack of bingos. I don't want to pay for coins I may waste by not getting bingos or shadow cards or whatever. I know it's a chance game but I just get tired of how infrequent bingos happen. I see people in the chat rooms lament over the same issue. I also don't care to make useless friends on FB to get objects for a completed room. Maybe this isn't the game for me.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|Rather than spoil the book for you, I recommend you buy it today. I wish I had read this book years ago.
0091939526|4.0|My son and I are working on self esteem and body improvement.  I believe he does like the book and is actually reading this huge book.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Jeffrey Archer never disappoints. His books are riveting and this one is no exception. It's part of a trilogy (and I understand there's a 4th book coming soon. Read them all. You'll be glad you did.
1439190275|5.0|I found the book to be well written, with advice that has resulted in successful weight loss and accompanying benefits.  I suspect that the timing of results will depend on consistent application of these instructions and that the timing will vary for different persons.  I experienced significant improvement in weight, and confidence that I was headed in the right direction, in three months. I intend to continue these techniques to my advantage.
B009ZQJ1G4|5.0|Never fails to entertain.  Story is great and the build up to the end never gets boring.  Recommended to friends.
0307272702|5.0|I was looking for information about the mechanism of weight gain, because I was pretty sure that what you eat plays an important role in what you weigh.  But, I didn't know what the advantages of one category of foods might have over another category of foods. This book gave me direction towards choices that have resulted in significant weight losses and subsequent improvement in feelings of well being.  I found substantial results after about three months of consistent application of these principles. By fine tuning of low thyroid  output with a doctor's prescription, and a complete change of diet, with moderate exercise, my health has improved beyond my expectations.
1781162646|5.0|I love Stephen King and seldom have anything bad to say about his work. This is more of a murder mystery, but still the great King aspects that I love. The child who is the savior, the fabulous use of language, a little love interest. One of his better books.
B004HX0P2Y|1.0|I didn't mind the movie, that's a question of individual taste, but my experience with the video service on amazon is no different than others. I absolutely hate that I can't store my own movie, which I pay full freight for, in a native file on my drive for use on projectors, or whatever other medium I chose. I recognize that the regulation is largely driven by the content owners and AMZN has little to do with it, but I feel a bit like someone sold me a dvd but told me that I can only watch it on Sony TV's. In 2013, that's absurd. Lets get it together guys. Until these services become less closed, I'll continue to rip my own DVD's into digital copies that I can enjoy with ease.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|I am 67 and love every song on this CD. He is the best. Deserves a Grammy or two for this work. He is also very funny and a great actor.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|Love this movie, I was it on Amazon Prime. Downloaded it to my Play Station, and started watching it immediately. the Convenience was beyond great.
0920236251|2.0|I LOVE this story and was beyond excited to share it with my daughter.  I ordered this book by searching for &#34;the paper bag princess&#34; this book new for 1.99 free prime with shipping came up.  I was so excited until it showed up... and it is tiny, Annikins apparently.  I had no idea what that meant and it is no where in the beginning of the description that shows when you are looking at the listing, you have to select read more to see that Annikins is a special kind of book printed small to be kid sized.  When people are listing something special like this they need to be sure to place the differences of the product first where it is clear to those purchasing.  I expect to be mislead on other sites but expect more from Amazon.
B005C8ENI0|5.0|Loved it...kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the whole movie.  Rent it!  You won't regret it! Awesome
0060555661|4.0|This book is well written and contains material you will probably never hear about on the radio or television.  Mr. Graham wrote this book for anyone who is serious about learning how to invest sensibly which is why it is a must read.
0345354435|5.0|If you liked the movie and don't have a problem reading a book that is written in mostly English with Russian and British slang sprinkled throughout. Read the book!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|The advertising for the Chromecast makes it appear that you can quickly and easily move anything you are looking at on your cell phone or laptop to your TV.  However, thats not even close to true.  You can watch a YouTube video on you TV from the phone or laptop but when that video ends the Chromecast disconnects.  You have to send each YouTube video you watch to the Chromecast and let it reconnect.. EVERY SINGLE TIME.<br /><br />I have had very good luck watching Netflix from my cell phone, no interruptions, excellent picture quality, but thats about the only thing I can use this for.  I have a horrible connection from my laptop to the Chromecast so I cant use it at all.  Finding the option to use the Chromecast from the laptop was another chore.  The instructions make it seem like you just plug and play, but nope, thats not true for the laptop. If you want to use the laptop you must download Google Chrome, but then it still wont work.  You have to find &#34;extentions&#34; and download the cast extention which then gives you the option to watch either YouTube or Netflix from the laptop on the TV.<br /><br />The idea that you can watch anything is no where near reality.  You have 3 choices; YouTube, Netflix or Google media items you have purchased. You can't see any of your photos on the TV, you cant watch any home videos you have on the phone, you cant see any documents, nothing. You should be able to play your music but not a single one of my hundreds of music files were compatible with the Chromecast, so the music doesnt work for me either.<br /><br />I can use it to watch one YouTube video at a time, reconnecting after each clip, and also use it to watch Netflix, but thats it.  For $35 I say it is worth the convenience of Netflix via cell phone, but I wish I had known all this before I bought it.<br /><br />Had it been advertised as just a &#34;Netflix by phone&#34; product I probably would have purchased it and been thrilled with it!  Instead I feel let down and am embarrassed that I told so many people I had purchased what I thought was going to be a TV-room life changing product.  It's not.  It just makes Netflix a little more convenient.
B004IJY4L0|5.0|Even if you aren't into electronic music this album will sway you into giving the genre a second chance.  The production value alone is outstanding.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Feedly has made some seemingly minor adjustments in the last few months which have actually made it a tremendously useful tool. Looking forward to additional features as they continue to develop their pro version. (Many features of which promise to eventually trickle down to the free version.)
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|The Shield was the best show on TV. Wish it would have gone longer then 7 seasons, but I understand why most shows don't. What made The Shield #1 and still hasn't been beaten, is the realism. It's not a show about 1 man saving the world from nuclear disasters multiple times (24). Instead it's about corrupt cops, that try and walk the line of good cops, but their humanity & errors of judgement force them to become men who bend and break the laws they swore to uphold. It's the classic struggle we all as people go through between good and evil, their struggle just has higher consequences. This show will never be trumped in my opinion.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is really awesome and addicting up there with angry birds for best game app ever.  From shaggyross the minion
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It is good application because is more clear to understand than others  and I like the forecast screen. It is always update.
